			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / FT Exporter (6): The move towards global purchasing - Kevin Done looks at the way Ford's CDW-27 project is showing how many of the company's planned reforms can be implemented / Global sourcing This autumn Ford, the world's second largest carmaker is launching the US versions of its so-called CDW-27 world car programme, a Dollars 6bn project that has helped to lay the foundations for one of the most radical organisational shake-ups in the US car maker's 91-year history. The programme has already spawned the Ford Mondeo large family car, which was launched in Europe in spring last year, and Ford is preparing to put the sister cars, the Ford Contour and the Mercury Mystique, on sale in north America. The CDW-27 project has convinced the company that it is possible to design, develop and engineer a car in one region - in this case Europe  - for manufacture in at least two regions - north America and Europe - for sale around the globe. It has given Ford the confidence to develop a bold strategy for restructuring its entire automotive operations - including the way that it deals with its components suppliers around the world. It is merging its European and north American operations into a single operating unit, Ford Automotive Operations, with effect from next January. It is setting up five so-called global vehicle centres, one in Europe and four in the US, to break down the group's regional barriers. Each centre will have worldwide responsibility for the design, development and engineering of particular vehicle ranges. The CDW-27 project, Ford's first successful world car programme, has prepared the way for the reorganisation and brought Ford for the first time to the global purchasing of components and systems. Ford maintains that this will provide 'economies of scale, world-class supplier productivity and cost levels, improved quality, faster time to market, better product innovation and enhanced supplier design involvement and support.' It will also mean that it will be able to choose the best products to be offered worldwide in any particular category. The CDW-27 project is showing how many of the planned reforms can be implemented. Versions of the Mondeo/Contour/Mystique will be assembled at Ford plants at Genk, Belgium, at Kansas City in the US and at Cuautitlan, Mexico. For the Mondeo programme alone Ford is spending Dollars 2.5bn a year on components bought from outside suppliers. According to Albert Caspers, Ford's new chairman for Europe, global purchasing means that the share taken by north American suppliers has jumped to 15 per cent for the European-built Mondeo compared with a share of only 1-2 per cent in Ford of Europe's traditional car programmes. 'We have also brought many European suppliers to north America and some have made joint ventures in the US,' he says. 'The philosophy was to develop a part only once from one supplier for the world. This is the first project where we have done this.' Ford estimates that about Dollars 140m worth of components will be exported annually to north America from Europe with about Dollars 260m worth of components coming from north America to Europe as part of the Mondeo programme. The development of an integrated, global supply base has resulted in a drastic reduction in the number of suppliers. The current US-built Ford Tempo/Mercury Topaz range has more than 700 suppliers - all in North America  -whereas the successor Ford Contour/Mercury Mystique models will have only 227 suppliers, drawn from around the world. Kerry Caliman, CDW-27 project manager for purchasing for Ford's north American automotive operations, says: 'the more business you can source globally, using the same supplier for the same part for both North America and Europe, the more you'll benefit from economies of scale and focused quality control efforts'.</p>

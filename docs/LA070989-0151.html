			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> An international association of computer professionals is planning to lift an  eight-year ban on contacts with the Soviet Union because of improvements in  human rights and scientific freedom. Bryan Kocher, president of the  73,000-member Assn. for Computing Machinery, said the ban was adopted in 1981,  primarily in response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, but that the  reasons for it have "now disappeared." At the same time, the New York-based  group has sent letters to Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping warning that  professional exchanges with China could be jeopardized by Beijing's violent  suppression of the country's pro-democracy movement.  </P></p>

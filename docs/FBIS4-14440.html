			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS commentator Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>   [Excerpts] Moscow, 30 Mar -- The Central Electoral  Commission has told an ITAR-TASS commentator that between last  December and the end of this March there were local elections in  69 regions of Russia, 60 of which were declared valid. In the  overwhelming majority of these regions, additional elections  needed to be held to fill local assemblies as a result of  voters' passivity the first time around. [passage omitted]    In the Chuvash Republic, elections took place in 28 out of  47  constituencies; in Voronezh Oblast -- in 35 out of 45; in  Kemerovo Oblast -- in 30 out of 35; and in Nizhnyy Novgorod --  in 32 out of 45 constituencies.    As an illustration of how politicians were more active then  voters, it was noted that in Belgorod Oblast, there were 104  candidates for 21 seats; 198 for 48 in Kirov Oblast; 187 for 30  in Omsk Oblast; and 210 candidates for 50 seats in Orel Oblast.    Only 19 percent of candidates in the elections had stood on  party tickets. The Communists were the most active party. In  the 27 March elections, 34 Russian Communist Party members were  elected to local assemblies, out of 200 candidates.    Former oblast Soviet chairmen were elected as deputies in  Kemerovo, Tambov, Voronezh, Novosibirsk, and other Oblasts.</p>

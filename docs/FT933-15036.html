			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Finance and the Family: Holiday homes alarm insurers - Bethan Hutton explains why getting cover for your country cottage can be so difficult HOUSEHOLD insurance premiums can vary so widely that it is best to get as many quotes as you can. Unfortunately, when it comes to a second home, that approach rarely is possible: most of the big insurers will not even consider covering a holiday home unless your main residence is also insured with them. They may even insist on getting both buildings and contents business from you before agreeing to take on the second address. Their reluctance is based on experience that unoccupied homes are a higher risk, and not just from burglaries. Most claims arise from water damage, whether from burst pipes or storms. An unnoticed burst pipe can cause havoc while a missing tile can let through a lot of water before it is spotted. For this reason, most insurers impose stringent conditions. They usually demand either that the water system is drained if you leave the property for more than 24 or 48 hours, or ask you to leave the heating on. Most also require that a neighbour or agent should check the property regularly. Insurers have long memories when it comes to assessing risks. Isolated cottages in north Wales still make some underwriters nervous, even though several years have passed since the last one was burnt down. Most companies say they will look at each case on its merits but, by and large, a cottage in Wales will cost more to insure than one in Cornwall. Some insurers - Royal Insurance and General Accident are two - charge the same for a particular area whether a house is a main or holiday home, but cover for the latter is likely to be restricted. Personal effects and valuables are a common exclusion - it is assumed you will not keep a collection of Ming china in your Highland croft - and any jewellery you take along to dazzle the locals will be covered under an all-risks clause in your main house policy. Some companies also exclude accidental damage, and offer only indemnity rather than new-for-old cover. Other insurers load the premiums for second homes to compensate for the increased risk. Norwich Union adds 50 per cent while Eagle Star charges 10 per cent more for buildings and 17.5 for contents. Guardian Royal Exchange loads contents premiums by 100 per cent, but charges the normal rate for building cover. Be warned, though: higher premiums do not necessarily mean that cover is as comprehensive as your main household insurance. Only a handful of companies offer stand-alone policies designed specifically for second homes. One is the Andrew Copeland group (081-656 8435), which deals with both UK and foreign holiday homes, whether private or used for letting. It can quote immediately for properties in the UK, France, Spain, Portugal, Cyprus, the Balearics, Canaries, Malta, Greece, Italy and Ireland. Standard cover abroad costs Pounds 2.50 per Pounds 1,000 for buildings, and Pounds 6.25 for contents; the UK equivalent is Pounds 2.75 and Pounds 3. Homes in other countries are referred to underwriters for a quote. Another specialist is Holiday Homes Insurance Services (0708-730 236). Its policies, underwritten by London &amp; Edinburgh and sold direct or through brokers, can cover second homes in the UK, France, Spain, Italy, Greece, Portugal and Malta. Building cover costs Pounds 2.75 per Pounds 1,000 abroad and Pounds 3 in the UK; contents are Pounds 6 per Pounds 1,000 abroad and Pounds 6.60 in the UK. One of its specialities is providing cover in the UK for chalet-style wooden holiday homes, which most insurers reject. Florida is increasing popular for second homes but UK insurers generally are reluctant to offer cover there or anywhere else in the US. This is because the public liability cover standard on European policies is unlikely to be enough to cope with the huge damages awards made by American courts. Owners of second homes there usually are recommended to take out insurance locally. Few of the large UK insurance companies will themselves insure holiday homes abroad but many have subsidiaries or associate companies in European countries - and sometimes elsewhere - to which they can direct customers. One benefit is that local insurers may prove cheaper and speedier at dealing with claims, and will provide policies adapted better to regulations and conditions on the spot. Subsidiaries of UK insurers may also have the advantage of offering an English language service, which could be a comfort for Tuscan villa-owners whose Italian can cope better with menus than the small print of policies and claim forms. Allowing friends and relatives to use your holiday home presents few problems - some insurers even welcome it, seeing any increase in occupancy as reducing the risk - but renting it, whether occasionally or regularly, is a complication from the company's point of view. It is important to let it know if you are planning to let the property; otherwise, any claims could be rejected. If you let only occasionally, and on a fairly non-commercial basis (say, to work colleagues or friends of friends), the company might be willing to cover you, but it will exclude accidental damage and theft except where there is evidence of forced entry. If you rent the house regularly to strangers, you will have to switch to a commercial policy rather than standard household insurance.</p>

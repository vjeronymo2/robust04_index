In revealing this new policy, the high-level  leadership of the central authorities stressed that we should  not rush headlong into mass action in the establishment of  investment zones for Taiwan businessmen and that we should carry  out solid work in economic relations and trade with Taiwan. How  we establish such zones depends on how we absorb investment by  Taiwan businessmen, and we should not confine ourselves to one  form.    The authoritative person quoted Deng Xiaoping as saying that  the Taiwan independence movement can best be contained by  letting the economy of the two sides become closely integrated.  The high level of the central authorities stressed that this  viewpoint of Deng Xiaoping should be embodied in the entire work  on Taiwan and that economic relations and trade with Taiwan is  engineering that places hope in the Taiwan people.    A high-level leader of the central authorities said in a  relevant speech a few days ago that the central authorities hold  that the request for the establishment of investment zones for  Taiwan businessmen put forward by some localities is good and  that they are considering giving approval to the establishment  of several such zones on a trial basis in several localities  along the coast. However, we should not rush headlong into mass  action in the establishment of investment zones for Taiwan  businessmen, but should make arrangements and give approval in a  planned manner. The central authorities hold that localities  which are not on the coast need not focus all their attention on  investment zones for Taiwan businessmen and that there are  numerous ways to attract Taiwan capital. For example, a major  Taiwan businessman can be allowed to develop a vast stretch of  land and then this businessman can attract other businessmen to  come. In this way, it will be possible to attract more Taiwan  businessmen to a development zone in a short time, and the open  zone will naturally take shape faster. Localities which fail to  obtain approval for the establishment of investment zones for  Taiwan businessmen may follow this very good method.    The authoritative person continued to quote a high-level  leader of the central authorities as saying that in recent  years, Taiwan businessmen have vied with one another in making  investment in the mainland. The volume of investment has grown  by a big margin and some businessmen have even asked to contract  the development of a large stretch of land. This being the  case, since some coastal economic development zones are already  almost filled with construction projects, and their fund-raising  capacity is almost fully utilized, these zones are far from  being able to meet the actual needs of investment by Taiwan  businessmen. The central authorities approving the  establishment of investment zones for Taiwan businessmen and  approving the adoption of more open policies for attracting  Taiwan capital is precisely to meet the needs of the situation  as it has developed.    He said that to attain reunification, it is first of all  necessary to let the Taiwan compatriots really understand the  mainland, particularly the tremendous changes since reform and  opening up began 15 years ago. The overwhelming majority of  Taiwan compatriots who invest in the mainland will benefit from  the market on the mainland. The increase in economic exchanges  will enable the Taiwan compatriots to increase their  understanding of the mainland and will deepen the feelings and  friendship between the people of the two sides of the strait.</p>

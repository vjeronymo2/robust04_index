			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 14 Feb (EFE) -- Peruvian  President Alberto Fujimori said today in Santa Fe de Bogota that  by the end of his term there will be no more terrorism in Peru,  because he will wipe it out.    "Two of the world's most violent terrorist groups are being  defeated, and by the end of my term they will no longer exist,"  Fujimori said, referring to the Shining Path [SL] and the Tupac  Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA).    Fujimori, who began a two-day official visit to Colombia  today, made the statement to journalists at the end of his first  meeting with Colombian President Cesar Gaviria.    According to the Peruvian president, terrorism and  subversive  violence have claimed 25,000 lives in Peru.    He asked jokingly: "What has been the meaning of `Emperor'  Fujimori's government?" He replied that his government "is  defeating" the violent groups.    Fujimori reiterated by the time his constitutional terms  ends  "neither the SL nor the MRTA will exist in Peru. I am going to  wipe them out."    Fujimori and Gaviria discussed during their first meeting  topics such as drug trafficking and guerrillas, topics that  affect both countries. They also discussed bilateral relations.    Both leaders will lay the groundwork for the creation of a  Binational Neighbor Commission, and tomorrow they will sign a  joint declaration in which they will announce new mechanisms of  cooperation for the struggle against drug trafficking and  guerrillas.</p>

			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN FRANCISCO DREAMIN' A LONG WAY FROM HOME;  </P> <P> THE FRAGRANCE OF COFFEE AND PATCHOULI HAS WAFTED FAR FROM THE GOLDEN GATE  </P> <P> In Milwaukee, a few years ago, if you tired of the beer and sausage, you could  head down to the Benjamin 2 Cafe and find offbeat, guitar-toting chess players  and the kind of coffee that made San Francisco's North Beach what we think it  is.  </P> <P> Or you could head for the Coffee Trader and enter upon a scene of sufficient  natural wood, health salads, fancy blends, cheese and long-limbed,  tennis-playing young laid-backs to dry your tears of San Francisco  homesickness.  </P> <P> In my home town of Cleveland, the Paris of northeastern Ohio, San Francisco has  firm roots. The little Bohemia around Euclid Heights Boulevard and Coventry is  North Beach, Haight-Ashbury and 16th &amp; Valencia all rolled into one living  crossroads.  </P> <P> The art theater sometimes shows X-rated movies and sometimes no movies at all,  but it's where you can usually count on midnight performances of  films-to-recite-along-with. Arabica is a coffee house like the Puccini.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hopeful Booksellers  </P> <P> Just as in San Francisco, the bookstores tend to fade away; but just as in San  Francisco, a hopeful bookseller is born every day. At Shaker Square there's  another bookstore, another Arabica, another movie house, various art galleries,  and street-strolling under friendly brown skies.  </P> <P> We needn't discuss how the California Dreamin', beat and hip style infected New  York, Chicago, Los Angeles. But Vence in southern France? The San Francisco  cafe there is called Feelings and features "American Fish" with cognac sauce,  "Feelings Tacos" and "Blueberries Lamb."  </P> <P> The dessert special is "un Brownie," which is described as gateau chocolat  Chantilly, and I urged the proprietor to add "Les Twinkies" to his menu. An  electric organ plays that old San Francisco jazz. The people there love San  Francisco, but an electric organ? Sometimes they don't get it exactly right.  San Francisco is not a roller rink.  </P> <P> In Martinique, too, a few years ago I came upon a California cafe on the shores  of the Caribbean. My rental car came to a screeching halt on the winding road  among carnivorous red flowers when I saw swirly Fillmore posters. The  proprietor said he had spent the best minutes of his life in Sausalito.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Foreign Legion  </P> <P> The next year, when I again visited Martinique, the new proprietor was a German  veteran of the French Foreign Legion, but the Jefferson Airplane and Grateful  Dead tapes were still in place. "Union Square! Lefty O'Doul's! Levi's 501  button jeans!" breathed the brave Teutonic former legionnaire.  </P> <P> The San Francisco state-of-mind spread like the smell of patchouli during the  beatnik and hippie periods, although the image of Westering, the Gold Rush, the  Sydney ducks, the Barbary Coast and International Settlement, the Black Cat  saloon gave traditional substance to the aroma.  </P> <P> It wasn't just the hills around here; it was also the alleys reminiscent of a  walled medieval town. Lurking and funning were always part of the style. The  Summer of Love, the Aquarian Age and the youth explosion sewed the label "Made  in San Francisco" on the world's pants.  </P> <P> Even before glasnost, there were youth cafes in Moscow where wide-rumped folks  went to do the tveest in their counterfeit Levis. In Toronto, the memory of  Swingin' London, which is only a memory in London, and Swingin' San Francisco,  which endures as a transmogrified myth nearly everywhere, has given the former  Hogtown a blush of pleasure.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tie-Dyed Clothes  </P> <P> Among worried upward mobiles at colleges and universities, the San Francisco  mystique is a frequent elective. Health foods are served as an option in dorm  meal programs. A person who wears tie-dyed clothes is likely to be a tenured  professor, but at UC Davis a young man sidled up to me with a precious secret  to share. In a lowered voice he whispered, "Pssst! I listen to Bob Dylan, too!"  </P> <P> Sometimes even San Francisco seems to be in the business of imitating itself.  One Saturday afternoon in May I visited the bandstand in Golden Gate Park,  where Big Brother and the Holding Company was performing a free concert.  Greenpeace was involved. The new Janis Joplin (Mark II; double mufflers) sang  out her heart to "save the dolphins," but the unmentioned point was that she  had a heart to sing out. The voice was strong and passionate, lacking only the  last desperate, ruined-monument croak of Joplin at the end of her life.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Aboriginal Hippies  </P> <P> At first glance, these seemed to be aboriginal hippies swaying in the sun. Was  that patchouli in the air? Was that Paul Krassner sniffing it? But many in the  crowd looked like burnouts and bikers, not the veterans of the old Panhandle  concerts but their grandchildren. A boy in red, high-topped tennis shoes gave  me a peace sign. "How are you today?"  </P> <P> "Good," I said.  </P> <P> "It's a good day to be good," he said, pronouncing good in the turned-on,  groovy, three-syllable manner, goo-oo-ood, and his girlfriend in her laces and  thongs beamed at him, beamed at me, beamed in general.  </P> <P> A huge potbellied man with a bear tattoo on his furry back, a bear and a lady  chasing each other in the underbrush, glared at me. He was sloped over his  bike. A Hell's Angel jacket hung from the handlebars. At approximately 300  pounds, he didn't fear someone would run off with his jacket.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Chocolate George  </P> <P> At first I was uncomfortable under his scrutiny, but then someone pointed a  camera at him and he went into his camera mode, as still as an icon upon his  saddle, mirrored sunglasses planted amid the grizzle of face, impassive, eager  to be of use, helping the photographer.  </P> <P> He, too, was enacting an image of San Francisco, this time the San Francisco  Hell's Angels, even if he was from Oakland. He remembers Chocolate George, the  Angel who used to drink his chocolate milk on Page until a speeding car at an  intersection in the Haight ended his chocolate habit and his enriched life.  </P> <P> When we're here, we're just here. The Potrero Hill neighborhood that includes  the San Francisco Thai Barbecue, the Goat Hill Pizza, that Greek place with the  good food and the endless name ending in -opolous, the Fifties coffee shop with  antique Coke signs and jukebox -- it's just another typical outcropping of the  San Francisco spirit, a mixture of innovation, ethnicity and nostalgia.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Breatharian  </P> <P> That's where I meet the breatharian, sometimes a writer, who can teach me to  live without eating. (I doubt I have the intestinal fortitude or chlorophyll  for it.)  </P> <P> In San Francisco, we can turn in any direction, take any bus and we're there.  In Los Angeles, I drive to the Sunset Strip, or to Hugo's in West Hollywood, or  to Venice in search of area code 415.  </P> <P> At Hugo's they tend to be pouring over scripts instead of manuscripts, but the  air of expectancy and salads, that dream of salvation through dreamland, puts  me into the proper procedures of reference.  </P> <P> And in Paris I climb Montparnasse toward the Aubergine, a vegetarian  restaurant, where I find Alan Ginsberg tinkling his little bells and singing a  Buddhist country rock song. I'm still home.  </P></p>

			<p>931102 FT  02 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Volkswagen enlivens Frankfurt's quiet day HOLIDAYS in several European countries and in three German states reduced bourse activity, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT saw volatility in individual stocks although the DAX index slipped 6.88 to 2,062.12, most leading stocks had a very quiet day and turnover fell from DM9.5bn to DM4.1bn. The blue chip exception was Volkswagen, up DM4.30 to DM398.30 on the session, and by another DM4.20 to DM402.50 in the post bourse. Mr Peter Bohnke, of Bank Julius Bar in Frankfurt, said that many traders liked to short VW, and had to cover after a major buyer emerged yesterday. Some smaller stocks shot up on a combination of the thin market and investment buying. Porsche climbed DM51 to DM868, the pharmaceuticals and dietics group, Altana, by DM34 to DM625 and the papermaker, PWA by DM6 to DM193. AMSTERDAM closed at the day's high, with activity remaining concentrated in the options and futures exchanges. The CBS Tendency index put on 0.6 to 136.5, with a stronger dollar helping to lift sentiment. In a week in which a number of the major companies release interims, Philips, out on Thursday, gained 40 cents to Fl 39.50 and its Polygram unit Fl 1.60 to Fl 72.30. KLM, also due out on Thursday, added 90 cents to Fl 40.60, picking up some of Friday's losses on fears that the Alcazar talks might have run into difficulty. Hoare Govett has put out a sell note, forecasting net profit of Fl 105m for the second quarter compared with Fl 154.6 in the same 1992 period. ZURICH experienced an uncertain session. However, late demand for the dollar sensitive Roche and Ciba-Geigy reversed the trend and the SMI index picked up from the day's low of 2,708.1 to close 3.9 higher at a record 2,727.1. Ciba-Geigy bearers, recent underperformers, added SFr15 to SFr815 while Roche certificates rose SFr40 to SFr5,790. Nestle, the most active issue, dipped SFr3 to SFr1,184, after a low of SFr1,170. Profit-taking in cyclicals left Alusuisse registered shares SFr16 easier at SFr527, while among mixed to lower financials, Swiss Re shed SFr100 to SFr3,770. ISTANBUL fell sharply, the composite index losing 565.4 or 3.9 per cent to 13,935.2, following the decision at the weekend to raise the basic rate of VAT from 12 per cent to 15 per cent. Although the move was widely expected, it illustrated the difficulties faced by the government, which is also under pressure because of an increase in Kurdish violence. ATHENS fell by more than 1.5 per cent on a further round of profit-taking, and disappointment over recent interim results. The general index lost 12.82 to 833.61 in turnover of some Dr2.7bn. TEL AVIV was another market where investors took profits, following its climb to record levels on Sunday. The Mishtanim index lost 2.4 to 238.81 in turnover of Shk392m, having risen to 241.21 on Sunday. Commentators said that the rally had been triggered by a statement from President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt in which he hoped that Israel and Syria would sign a peace agreement by the year end.

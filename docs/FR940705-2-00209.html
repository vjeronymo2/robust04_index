			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix K&hyph;II&hyph;B. Written instructions and training of personnel shall be provided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to assure that cultures of viable organisms containing recombinant DNA molecules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are handled prudently and that the workplace is kept clean and orderly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix K&hyph;II&hyph;C. In the interest of good personal hygiene, facilities (e.g., hand  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> washing sink, shower, changing room) and protective clothing (e.g., uniforms,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> laboratory coats) shall be provided that are appropriate for the risk of exposure to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> viable organisms containing recombinant DNA molecules. Eating, drinking,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> smoking, applying cosmetics, and mouth pipetting shall be prohibited in the work  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix K&hyph;II&hyph;D. Cultures of viable organisms containing recombinant DNA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> molecules shall be handled in facilities intended to safeguard health during work  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with microorganisms that do not require containment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix K&hyph;II&hyph;E. Discharges containing viable recombinant organisms shall be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> handled in accordance with applicable governmental environmental regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix K&hyph;II&hyph;F. Addition of materials to a system, sample collection, transfer of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> culture fluids within/between systems, and processing of culture fluids shall be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conducted in a manner that maintains employee's exposure to viable organisms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containing recombinant DNA molecules at a level that does not adversely affect the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health and safety of employees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix K&hyph;II&hyph;G. The facility's emergency response plan shall include provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for handling spills. Spills and accidents which result in overt exposures to organisms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containing recombinant DNA molecules are immediately reported to the Biological  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Safety Officer, Institutional Biosafety Committee, NIH/ORDA, and other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate authorities (if applicable). Reports to NIH/ORDA shall be sent to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Office of Recombinant DNA Activities, National Institutes of Health, Building 31,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> room 4B11, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, (301) 496&hyph;9838.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix K&hyph;III.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Okayama, June 4 KYODO -- Officials from a small  Japanese town will leave Tuesday [7 June] on a 10-day visit to  former Yugoslavia in search of ways to provide assistance to the  war-torn country.    The Kamogawa Town office in Okayama Prefecture, western  Japan, enacted a unique local regulation in April calling on its  people to conduct their own rescue operations in countries  stricken by disasters and war.    This will be the first overseas dispatch of its officials  under the regulation. It is very unusual for Japanese local  governments to have such a rule, town officials said.    The two officials, Noboru Nishida, 45, and Kiyoshi Okada,  41,  will fly first from Tokyo to Geneva where they will visit such  U.N. bodies as the World Health Organization (WHO).    After entering the Croatian capital of Zagreb, the two will  have a first-hand look at situations there and study how  Japanese nongovernmental organizations and U.N. bodies are  helping local people.    After their return, the town plans to draw up a concrete  program for its own international assistance that will be  applied to other countries in the future, the town officials  said.</p>

			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: N American wood-pulp prices raised again Several North American wood-pulp producers have announced their fifth price rise of the year to levels that are roughly double those at the bottom of the cycle in mid-1993. The producers plan to raise the price of northern bleached softwood kraft pulp, the industry's benchmark product, by USDollars 50 to Dollars 750 a tonne on January 1. The increase, if successful, will bring prices to within striking distance of the record Dollars 840 reached in 1989. The world pulp market has been buoyed by a strong rise in paper consumption, especially in Europe and South-east Asia, and by fears of a strike at pulp and paper mills in British Columbia. Demand is so strong that many North American producers are unable to meet their customers' full requirements. World-wide producer stocks have fallen by almost half from the peak reached last year. According to the Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, Canadian pulp mills operated at 96 per cent of capacity during the first nine months of this year, up from 85 per cent in 1993. Shipments of market pulp to western Europe climbed by 21 per cent, to Japan by 39 per cent and to the rest of Asia and Africa by 49 per cent. Analysts are divided on whether and for how long the price surge will continue. Mr Chip Dillon of Salomon Brothers in New York recently forecast that NBSK prices would peak at Dollars 860 a tonne in 1997. Like many other market watchers, however, Mr Dillon predicts a correction in early 1995, reflecting the start-up of two large new mills in Indonesia and a slowdown in the stocks build-up. The unexpectedly steep climb in pulp prices last week led Kimberly-Clark, the Dallas-based papermaker, to cancel a plan to spin off its pulp mills in Ontario and Alabama into a new public company.</p>

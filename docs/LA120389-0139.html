			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> WOLFSHEIMER OFF BASE  </P> <P> I am writing in response to Armando Acuna's Nov. 3 article, "Port Commissioner  Assails Presence of 'Crazies.' " Centre City Planning Committee member and Port  Commissioner Louis Wolfsheimer was quoted as saying he thought he would catch  "a lot of hell" for his statements. I hope he catches something else as well:  an understanding of what it must be like to suffer from two conditions most  disparaged by society -- mental illness and homelessness.  </P> <P> To be homeless is hard enough. To be homeless and mentally ill means that a  person is both distressed and shunned, made powerless and dependent. The  homeless mentally ill suffer three times the morbidity and mortality rates as  their counterparts in the general population.  </P> <P> Mr. Wolfsheimer is correct about one thing he reportedly said: conditions  downtown are worsening. But for whom are they getting worse? Apparently, Mr.  Wolfsheimer feels that he is the victim of the increasing plight of the  homeless mentally ill.  </P> <P> Having to listen to someone "screaming to the heavens" is uncomfortable. But as  hard as listening might be, it is infinitely more terrible to be the ones who  are screaming. Those are not screams of joy or delight. They are screams of  pain and fear, of hope that someone might hear, listen and help soothe the  terror of being homeless and mentally ill.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, all Mr. Wolfsheimer suggested to help ease the pain was to call  the police and have them take these folks to the County Mental Hospital. He  must know that CMH is a revolving door for these people. Indeed, he is quoted  as saying that it will at least take them "five hours to get back downtown."  </P> <P> I suggest that our police have more to do than to waste five hours transporting  mentally ill patients to CMH and back.  </P> <P> Mr. Wolfsheimer's remarks suggest that the homeless mentally ill are grist for  the criminal justice mill. Glasnost notwithstanding, the Soviet Union is the  only place I'm aware of that views mental illness in that framework. It should  be clear to Mr. Wolfsheimer that mental illness and homelessness are social  service and treatment issues, not criminal justice issues.  </P> <P> It is disappointing and frustrating that Mr. Wolfsheimer, a person in a  position of leadership and trust, offers simplistic, knee-jerk solutions to  complex human and social problems. I am concerned that he blames the victims  and, at best, is insensitive to their rights. I am even more concerned that he  is in a position to make public policy judgments that affect all of us.  </P> <P> In order for the people of San Diego -- the homeless and domiciled, mentally  ill and "normal" -- to move forward and succeed, we need real leadership. We  need problem solvers, not blamers. We need people with foresight and insight,  not tunnel vision. We need people who feel the connection among all of us, not  those who perpetuate the myth of "us versus them". We need people with heart,  not just mouth.  </P> <P> STUART BARDACH  </P> <P> Director, Vista Hill Foundation Homeless Project  </P></p>

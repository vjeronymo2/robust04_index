			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Feb. 2 (YONHAP) -- North Korea is stepping  up "processing-on-commission" trade that is similar to the early  shape of China's opening, the Korea Trade Promotion Corporation  (KOTRA) said on Wednesday.    KOTRA issued a report titled "The Reality of North  Korea-Japan Trade of Processing-on-commission and Inter-Korea  Trade," which said that North Korea is encouraging  processing-on-commission trade, following the example set by  China in the early stages of its opening.    In processing on commission, foreign companies provide North  Korean factories with raw materials and buy the finished  products.    "The new trade system" which North Korean President Kim  Il-song introduced late last year to diversify trading methods  is very similar to "the new trade method" China began in 1979,  the KOTRA report said.    Under the system, all organizations including the External  Economy Commission, government ministries, commissions, district  administrative bodies, trading companies and manufacturing  enterprises should move to expand external trade in addition to  doing their own work.    The system also means that the forms of trade should be  diversified toward processing, border and compensation trade.    North Korea's biggest partners in processing on commission  trade are Japanese enterprises, especially those related to  Chochongnyon, a pro-Pyongyang organization of Korean residents  in Japan, and the main field is the textile industry, according  to KOTRA.    Textiles exported by North Korea to Japan in the form of  processing on commission trade reached 8.7 billion Japanese yen  in 1992, up 26.9 percent from a year earlier, and amounted to  8.8 billion yen in the first 10 months of 1993, up 38.2 percent  from the same period of 1992.    Meanwhile, South Korea is prohibiting businessmen from  visiting North Korea, making it difficult for them to instruct  North Korean workers on the advanced technology necessary for  processing on commission trade for high-value-added goods.    South Korea's processing on commission trade with North  Korea  is thus limited to some simple needlework, KOTRA said.    Nonetheless, South Korean purchases of goods processed on  commission in North Korea, mainly textiles, skyrocketed 729  percent to 4.39 million dollars in nine cases last year.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul -- The delegation of Peruvian legislators  visiting Seoul in response to an invitation extended by the ROK  National Assembly have expressed the need for strict adherence  to nuclear nonproliferation treaties, which they said are the  only guarantees for peaceful coexistence.    The delegation of Peruvian legislators comprising Oswaldo  Sandoval Aguirre, Carlos Blanco Oropeza, and Antero Flores Araoz  warned that the nuclear subject is an issue that concerns the  entire world and not only the Korean peninsula. The Peruvian  legislators also expressed their hope that mechanisms of  understandings will be achieved to avoid any armed conflicts.    After meeting ROK Parliamentary speaker Yi Man-sop, the  Peruvian legislators said: We hope the right of South Koreans to  live in peace will be respected. "Our countries want peace not  war because only thus we will be able to achieve our countries'  development."</p>

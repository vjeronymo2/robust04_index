			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Billy Paddock] </F>   [Text] The NP's [National Party] allocation of seats for  the national assembly will be determined differently from all  the other parties on the national ballot paper because it is the  only party to have submitted only regional lists.    The Electoral Act stipulates that at least 200 of the  assembly seats are to be determined from political parties'  regional lists for the national assembly. Parties are entitled  to also submit a national list of candidates for up to 200  seats. This allowed parties such as the ANC to draw up a list  of 200 candidates from a broad spectrum of people at its head  office that are not necessarily regionally based.    The NP was the only party that opted for the second method  of  determining its national assembly seats -- arguing that by  submitting only regional lists it showed its commitment to a  federal system.    It is estimated that, assuming a 100 percent poll, each  55,000 votes will be worth one seat in the assembly. This is  calculated by taking the estimated 22.2-million eligible voters,  divided by 400 seats.    All parties expect the NP will have their seats in the  assembly determined by, firstly, taking the total number of  votes cast for their parties respectively divided by, say,  55,000, to determine the number of seats they will have in the  national assembly. Half of these seats won will be filled by  those on their national lists.    The rest of their seats will be filled from their respective  regional lists of candidates for the national assembly. This  will be determined by taking the respect regional tally of votes  won by each party and dividing this by 55,000, to give the  proportion of seats that party can fill in the national assembly  from that region.</p>

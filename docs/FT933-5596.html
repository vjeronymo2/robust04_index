			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Courtaulds Textiles slips to Pounds 13.7m - Martin Taylor prepares his departure with a strong second half recovery in prospect FOR A man who appears to get most things right Mr Martin Taylor's timing does not look good. The chief executive and chairman of Courtaulds Textiles yesterday announced a 16.5 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 13.7m for the half year to end-June. The company is expected to recover strongly over the next six months, but by then Mr Taylor will have already moved on to his new job as chief executive of Barclays. At the mere mention of his departure Mr Taylor tries to anticipate the follow-up question. 'Am I sorry that I am leaving Courtaulds? Yes, it is earlier than I would have liked. But do I think it is reckless? No, the company is in great shape.' If Mr Taylor's timing is in doubt his natural ability for public relations is not. His ability to charm shareholders, analysts and journalists alike partly explains his success at Courtaulds. A big feature of his tenure at the company has been its ability to generate cash. When it was demerged three years ago it had borrowings of more than Pounds 70m. After reducing net debt in 1991 by Pounds 39m, a further reduction of Pounds 33m was achieved last year. By the year end the company will effectively be ungeared. However, the price has been high. He has closed 20 out of the company's 23 UK spinning mills, axing thousands of jobs. The City was delighted. But there are still critics who believe he contributed to the decimation of the British textiles industry. Perhaps the most extraordinary thing about his tenure at Courtaulds is that there was never a bigger row over his rationalisation programme. 'I could never understand,' says one textile analyst, 'why there was not an uproar among the trade unions or in the press when Mr Taylor wielded the knife.' By way of an explanation Mr Taylor says he has always believed in the personal touch. 'It is much harder to be nasty about someone if you have met them first.' Internally, Mr Taylor did away with hierarchies. He once told a merchant banker: 'I cannot manage without talking to everyone.' Externally, he did much the same. An analyst who talked somewhat critically to one of Courtaulds' institutional shareholders remembers being surprised to receive a call from Mr Taylor the next day inviting him for lunch. Having got through the difficult period of rationalisation, Mr Taylor can take satisfaction that he all but eliminated borrowings during one of the worst recessions. He has not, however, been able to achieve the same results with the profit and loss account, which is one of the reasons why he would have preferred the Barclays job to have come up later. After stripping out the effects of lower interest receivable because of the fall in UK interest rates and the decline in the contribution from the pension fund surplus the profits and earnings per share were broadly flat. 'Not a particularly beautiful set of results,' explains Mr Taylor. Analysts are forecasting full year pre-tax profits of about Pounds 45m. Mr Taylor is careful not to make too many predictions about the future. He says the last thing he wants to do is leave his successor, Mr Noel Jervis, with albatrosses around his neck. But in the longer-term Mr Taylor is bullish about the group's prospects. 'If the trends had not been in the right direction I would not have raised the dividend by almost 7 per cent,' he says. He also believes he has left the company in a good position to make further acquisitions. If Courtaulds' future profits match expectations further praise will probably be lavished on Mr Taylor. If profits are disappointing it will be Mr Jervis who will be forced to give an explanation. Perhaps Mr Taylor's timing is good after all. See Lex</p>

			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / Names' case in US is dismissed A US judge has dismissed a case brought in Ohio by a group of Lloyd's Names, on the grounds that the litigation must be heard in English courts. The Names alleged that Ohio state securities laws were violated when they were invited to join the London insurance market. The judge dismissed the case because a clause contained in agreements between Names and Lloyd's stated that US courts had no jurisdiction over the matter.</p>

			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NAILING DOWN HAMMER;  </P> <P> BOOKS: AUTHOR STEVE WEINBERG SPENT FIVE YEARS TRYING TO CAPTURE ON PAPER THE  ELUSIVE INDUSTRIALIST WHO MADE OXY PETROLEUM A GIANT. NOW HIS SUBJECT IS  FIGHTING TO BANISH THE BOOK.  </P> <P> When 91-year-old industrialist Armand Hammer popped up in the news recently  because he had a pacemaker installed, he needed no introduction. Anyone who  turns Occidental Petroleum into a multinational conglomerate, builds an art  empire, pumps millions of dollars into cancer research and shuttles around the  world as a citizen-diplomat is sure to be a household name.  </P> <P> With two autobiographies, two authorized biographies and tons of newspaper and  magazine articles about Hammer on library shelves, his life is an open book.  </P> <P> Or so it seems.  </P> <P> But in late 1984, author Steve Weinberg, an associate journalism professor at  the University of Missouri, decided to get to know Hammer better. Over the next  five years, Weinberg interviewed about 600 of Hammer's friends, enemies and  associates and studied "hundreds of thousands" of pages of documents.  </P> <P> The result is the newly released "Armand Hammer, The Untold Story," a 501-page  profile that Weinberg said is far too intricate to boil down into any sort of a  capsule summary.  </P> <P> Hammer's attorneys have had no such reluctance.  </P> <P> In an unusual letter urging publisher Little Brown &amp; Co. to drop the book,  they argued that "The Untold Story" portrays Hammer "as the scion of a morally  bankrupt family, who from young adulthood has had a propensity for criminal and  fraudulent behavior."  </P> <P> "In keeping with such a theme," the letter continued, "the book contains dozens  of passages impugning (Hammer's) motives, reflecting adversely on his integrity  and inferring that he is, and has been throughout his life, unscrupulous and  willing to attain personal goals and ambitions through criminal acts, breaches  of fiduciary duty or other unconscionable behavior."  </P> <P> Neither Hammer nor his attorneys would talk to The Times about Weinberg's book.  </P> <P> But in their letter, dated last July, the attorneys stated that the book, which  Hammer also has moved to keep from being published in Great Britain, is "beyond  redemption by corrections."  </P> <P> Weinberg scoffs at that accusation. In his view, the controversy merely raises  basic questions facing any biographer: How does one accurately and honestly  portray the life of another human?  </P> <P> Even before Hammer's best-selling autobiography hit the stores in 1987,  then-Vice President George Bush, former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Gerald  Ford, Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) and Israeli leader Menachem Begin  contributed gushing publicity blurbs. So did Walter Cronkite, Dan Rather and  Barbara Walters.  </P> <P> But in an article in Regardie's magazine the year before, Weinberg had written  that "Hammer has created a persona that sometimes seems to conflict with the  facts. Without the facts it is hard to know where myth ends and reality begins.  . . . Many journalists have failed to probe behind Hammer's carefully  cultivated image. Hammer has preempted the market in information about himself.  . . ."  </P> <P> That assessment was underscored as he set out to research the book, Weinberg  said. "The Doctor," as everyone calls Hammer, refused to talk; he and his  associates told others not to talk either, sources who did speak up told  Weinberg.  </P> <P> "Almost everyone who currently draws money from him in any connection said no,"  Weinberg said.  </P> <P> Weinberg is particularly angry that while he was submitting his book proposal  to various publishing houses, someone violated an unwritten, sacred rule of the  industry and, he asserts, leaked a copy to Hammer. He also has heard from  former Hammer associates that The Doctor disliked the article in Regardie's.  </P> <P> "And common sense says it didn't help that I run an organization called  Investigative Reporters and Editors," said Weinberg, the executive director of  that respected professional group.  </P> <P> But he remains uncertain why Hammer, who by all accounts relishes publicity,  was so adamant in attempting to lower a veil of silence on his effort. Still,  bolstered by a $160,000 advance, Weinberg set out to piece together a portrait  of a man who didn't want to be portrayed.  </P> <P> With or without Hammer's stamp of approval, the basic threads of his life shake  out the same in the various biographies.  </P> <P> The differences are in the authors' approach and inclusion of details.  </P> <P> These differences are even reflected in chapter headings. The first chapter of  the authorized biography, for instance, is titled "Genesis of Genius." The  first chapter of Weinberg's unauthorized biography is "A Bankrupt Family."  </P> <P> For the most part, though, Weinberg is aggressively timid about drawing  conclusions.  </P> <P> He is not, for instance, an admirer of the now popular psycho-historical school  of biography, as practiced by Gail Sheehy and others: "I don't think a  biographer should put his subject on the couch any more than necessary. . . .  We have trouble knowing what our own wife or brother or sister or mother is  thinking at any time. What presumption would lead me to tell people what Armand  Hammer is thinking?"  </P> <P> Such protestations aside, Weinberg does juxtapose facts and supply a few  editorial asides to hint at the psychological forces that shaped Hammer's life  and set him on the "quest for respect and respectability."  </P> <P> In Weinberg's portrayal, Hammer's father, Julius, was a man who believed  sincerely in socialism, yet worked hard to support his family as a capitalist,  managing eight drugstores at one time.  </P> <P> At one point in his investigation, Weinberg unearthed documentation that in  1906 Julius Hammer declared bankruptcy, apparently, the book suggests, to  illegally evade creditors.  </P> <P> A long battle ensued. But Weinberg concludes that "the relative painlessness  with which Julius and Rose (Armand's mother) escaped from bankruptcy court,  despite the untruthfulness of their testimony, almost surely impressed upon  everybody that cover-ups and convenient memory lapses could be useful tactics."  </P> <P> At age 10, Armand was sent by his parents to live with a socialist colleague of  his father's in Connecticut and stayed there five years -- ". . . it seems not  to have done any lasting harm to his psyche, unless a possible feeling of  abandonment should be regarded as causing his lifelong quest for public  adulation," Weinberg writes.  </P> <P> Hammer took over as the head of his family at age 21, when his father was  arrested and eventually convicted of first-degree manslaughter in connection  with the death of a woman on whom he had performed an abortion. Many observers  at the time contended that the 2 1/2 years Hammer's father spent in Sing Sing  prison stemmed from his leftist beliefs more than any lapse in medical  judgment.  </P> <P> Hammer's fight to free his father became a personal crusade, and Weinberg  traces a similar tenacity -- and what the author sees as a similar willingness  to bend the rules -- through some of Hammer's many other quests, including his  thus-far unsuccessful attempt to drill for oil in Pacific Palisades and his  successful bid to receive a presidential pardon for making illegal campaign  contributions to former President Richard Nixon.  </P> <P> Hammer first made his fortune selling medicine with a high dose of alcohol  during Prohibition and quickly became, in Weinberg's words, "a deal junkie." On  a trip to Moscow in 1921, Hammer met, and impressed, Soviet premier Vladimir  Ilyich Lenin. Unexpectedly, he settled for nine years in the Soviet Union,  where he operated an asbestos mine, established a pencil factory and began  dealing in Czarist art, among other enterprises.  </P> <P> Hammer and his third wife, Frances, didn't invest in Occidental Petroleum until  1956, when it was a tiny company with $79,000 in assets. They thought several  new wells Oxy planned to drill at the time would be losers and that those  financial losses would make a nice tax shelter for their already substantial  wealth, Weinberg writes.  </P> <P> Instead, the drillers hit oil.  </P> <P> Other successes followed, and, in 1957, Hammer, who had been briefly reluctant  to get into the industry, became president of Occidental Petroleum, which then  had a full-time staff of three. Quickly, Weinberg writes, Hammer began  "reshaping Occidental's board of directors in his image."  </P> <P> Hammer has never been a majority shareholder in Occidental. Rather, Weinberg  writes, he controlled the company then and now with "his forceful personality,  keen mind, capacity for work and incessant salesmanship."  </P> <P> And cunning. For example, Hammer demanded that many Oxy board members submit  signed, undated letters of resignation, which kept the members effectively  under his thumb, Weinberg writes.  </P> <P> As the company grew and diversified, it ran into the sort of problems any  multinational conglomerate might. Allegations of illegal payoffs to government  officials have haunted Hammer for years, for instance. As has labor unrest.  </P> <P> One issue that receives Weinberg's attention is whether Hammer has, at times,  put Occidental's bottom line ahead of the greater public good, as when  Occidental inherited the toxic mess at Love Canal and, critics have said,  dragged its corporate feet in settling claims.  </P> <P> Similarly, Weinberg's book suggests that Hammer's oil dealings with Libya "set  in train the oil price rises of the 1970s" and eventually "without question . .  . changed the balance of power in the world."  </P> <P> On the other hand, the book also raises the issue of whether Hammer sometimes  puts his own ego -- and, some say, capricious goals -- ahead of the interests  of Occidental, as suggested by the class-action lawsuits that have been filed  against him by shareholders over the years.  </P> <P> Weinberg asserts that out of respect for the intelligence of readers, his book  leaves such subjective issues open to debate. Besides, he's not sure of his own  conclusions, he said. At no point in the writing or research did he ever have  the sort of epiphany some biographers experience -- a moment when the sea of  facts and anecdotes parts miraculously and the True Nature of the person under  scrutiny reveals itself.  </P> <P> "I have a great deal of respect for some of what he's done; a great deal of  abhorrence for some of what he's done. He's very complex. Maybe that was my  epiphany -- how complex he is. . . . Some think he walks on water. Some think  he's the devil incarnate."  </P> <P> In an essay on the art of biography he wrote for the Missouri Review, Weinberg  quoted Thomas Carlyle: "A well-written life is almost as rare as a well-spent  one."  </P> <P> He rewrote this one six times, from beginning to end. But he remains  unconvinced that anyone ever fully captures a person's life in print. "I'm very  humble about the biographer's job," he said.  </P> <P> The reviews of "The Untold Story," however, have been generally favorable. If  anything, they accuse Weinberg of letting Hammer off easy. Fortune magazine  reviewer Irwin Ross called it "a good book, iconoclastic by necessity but  judicious in tone, skeptical rather than hostile."  </P> <P> The New York Times said that "Mr. Weinberg, in spite of his careful detachment,  appears to be rather too easily won over by Mr. Hammer."  </P> <P> The only review that makes Weinberg bristle appeared in Business Week. In it,  Stewart Toy wrote that "the most striking thing about this book is how little  the facts vary from those in Hammer's 1987 autobiography."  </P> <P> Weinberg argues that while both books are basically accurate in the facts they  present, his book is packed with new information.  </P> <P> For instance, none of Hammer's four major run-ins with the U. S. Securities and  Exchange Commission are mentioned in Hammer's 1987 autobiography. By filing  Freedom of Information Act requests with the SEC, Weinberg turned up reams of  previously unavailable information, he said.  </P> <P> Hammer continues to fight him in federal court on the release of documents  detailing the last two SEC investigations of Occidental, contending those  files, which pertain, in part, to Hammer's negotiations in Libya and Latin  America, "involve supposed national security issues," Weinberg said.  </P> <P> "Hammer and his lawyers went crazy to stop me. They spent a lot of time and I  presume a lot of money to convince the SEC not to release the files," he said.  For the book, Weinberg had to rely on now-available public records to discuss  those later investigations.  </P> <P> He said he hopes to include the information that will come from further release  of documents in subsequent editions.  </P> <P> That is, if a Hammer lawsuit doesn't somehow push the book out of print.  </P> <P> In his biography, Weinberg quotes Hammer attorney Louis Nizer as saying that  Hammer is "unabashedly litigious. . . . When principle is involved, he rejects  compromise. . . . It does not matter how great the gamble."  </P> <P> So at first, Weinberg thought Hammer was simply trying to quash a book that  contained more information than Hammer wanted the public to have. After all, he  said, virtually everyone he talked to agrees that "The Doctor likes to control  his own image and own fate."  </P> <P> But lately Hammerologists have suggested to Weinberg that The Doctor may  actually be cooking up the controversy as a convoluted way to feed his own  fame.  </P> <P> "Enough people who know Hammer have suggested that that I'm beginning to  believe it -- especially considering that he hasn't pressed things," Weinberg  said. "I'm more and more convinced that he's just wily enough to have done all  this to boost sales of the book."  </P></p>

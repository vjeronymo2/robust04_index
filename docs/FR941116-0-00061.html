If actual data are not available for calendar year 1994 when the rate change filing is made, the information for calendar year 1994 must be comprised of the most recently available actual data annualized for the year 1994. A schedule containing the information comprised of actual data for calendar year 1994 must be filed not later than March 31, 1995. Thereafter, carriers must file page 700 as a part of their annual Form No. 6 filing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4.

A carrier must substantiate the costs incurred by filing the data required by Part 346 of this chapter. A carrier that makes such a showing may change the rate in question, based upon the cost of providing the service covered by the rate, without regard to the applicable ceiling level under &sect;342.3.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 5.

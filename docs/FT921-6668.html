			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / International Company News: Deere &amp; Co reduces shortfall DEERE &amp; Co, the US heavy equipment-maker, managed to reduce first-quarter losses, thanks largely to improved prices and greater efficiency. The company suffered a net loss of Dollars 19.9m, or 26 cents a share, in its 1992 first quarter, ended January 31, compared with a loss of Dollars 43.1m, or 57 cents, in the same period a year ago. Worldwide production was the same as last year's during the first quarter, but net sales rose to Dollars 1.45bn from Dollars 1.43bn last year. Mr Hans Becherer, chairman, said first-quarter results were affected by continued weak demand and efforts to reduce company and dealers' inventories. But heavy discounting to improve sales has moderated. Lawn and grounds care equipment sales and production were higher, while agricultural equipment volumes were down in the first quarter. Prospects for the rest of 1992 are uncertain due to the recession and low customer confidence. While the North American agricultural market would appear to be poised for an upturn, farmers' buying attitudes still seem cautious, the company said. Retail demand in overseas markets is expected to decline in 1992, reflecting European farmers' concern with the Gatt negotiations. Deere has consequently reduced its scheduled production tonnage this year by about 5 per cent compared with that of 1991. Deere's lower production levels are expected to result in further reductions in dealer and company inventories.</p>

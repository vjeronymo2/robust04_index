			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LUYENDYK GETS FINE, PROBATION FOR TRACK VIOLATION  </P> <P> Arie Luyendyk of the Netherlands, winner of the Indianapolis 500, was fined  Saturday and placed on probation for the rest of the season for a track  violation during Friday's qualifying session for the Molson-Indy race.  </P> <P> Wally Dallenbach, chief steward for CART, the Indy-car sanctioning body, said  Luyendyk was penalized for failing to observe the checkered flag at the end of  the 30-minute qualifying session.  </P> <P> "I accept the fine and I understand why they are doing it," Luyendyk said. "All  I can say is that I didn't do it intentionally and I'm sorry for any rules  infraction.  </P> <P> "I do think that probation is a bit harsh, but that's what's been decided and  we'll put this incident behind us and go on with our program for the week."  </P> <P> The Dutch driver reportedly ran three fast laps on the 1.78-mile, 11-turn  temporary circuit after the checkered flag was displayed, then sped down pit  lane with crew members, officials and media already over the pit wall.  </P></p>

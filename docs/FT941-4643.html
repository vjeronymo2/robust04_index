			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Standard Chartered While HSBC has been diversifying out of Asia with its purchase of Midland, Standard Chartered seems to be moving in the other direction. Not only did three quarters of last year's operating profits originate in the Far East; the bank is talking about disposing of activities in the industrial world that do not fit in with its particular focus. All that makes its shares attractive to investors looking for emerging market exposure. But it also makes the business more risky, especially given Standard's abnormally low regional bad debt provisions. That in turn requires a high return. Yesterday's 4 per cent fall in the share price suggests Standard's net return on shareholders' funds of 20.8 per cent is not yet quite high enough, even though it is roughly similar to that of HSBC. A high return is all the more necessary since the bank is still highly leveraged, especially in Hong Kong, where net assets of only Pounds 307m support a balance sheet of Pounds 11.5bn. Standard now has some healthy earnings to retain, but its tier one capital ratio was bolstered last year by an issue of preference capital and a reduction in risk-weighted assets. A test for the new management is to exploit its Asian franchise to improve returns. This year it will be helped by falling UK provisions and a lower tax charge. Standard should earn enough to permit another large dividend increase. That could underpin the share price but it would take evidence of more fundamental improvement to drive it forward again.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] [Unidentified correspondent] I welcome to the  studio Csaba Tabajdi, representative of the Hungarian Socialist  Party [MSZP] and minority policy expert. The topic of our  conversation is the MSZP's policy in connection with the  Hungarians living beyond our borders. In the opinion of your  party, how important is the issue of Hungarians beyond the  borders?    [Tabajdi] I think that what is laid down in our program is  clear for every political force in Hungary: Dealing with the  Hungarians beyond the borders has to be one of the central  elements of Hungarian politics at all times and in all  circumstances. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] Leading politicians in the MSZP have made  some statements recently that could be misinterpreted. Let me  ask you outright: Is the situation of Hungarian minorities a  condition of good relations with neighboring countries?    [Tabajdi] I think that in the past weeks, in the heat of the  election campaign, a lot of ambiguous statements were made.  However, for me, the statement adopted by the Socialist Party's  congress at the end of February is the guiding line. This laid  down the three elements of Hungarian foreign policy, which are  in coordinated relations with each other. These are:  Integration with Western Europe, relations with the neighbors,  and the treatment of Hungarians living beyond the borders. We  have elaborated in detail in this document our party's minority  policy, stating that these three elements are of equal  importance. Thus, there is no return to the Kadar era of  mocking silence. [passage omitted]    However, we not only disagree with the politics of that time  but also with the past four years' government politics. This  means that without discarding or sacrificing the issue of  Hungarians beyond the border on the altar of bilateral  relations, much more should have been done in the past four  years for bilateral relations. Let me bring a concrete example,  a practical one, for we are very practical; at the moment,  Hungary has no valid agreement on investment protection and  preventing double taxation with any of her neighbors. [passage  omitted]    [Correspondent] [passage omitted] What do you consider more  important, the conclusion of basic treaties with our neighbors  or settling the situation of Hungarians living beyond the  borders?    [Tabajdi] The two are inseparable. [passage omitted] These  basic treaties have to answer two vital questions that are the  problems of the region; one of them is the question of the  borders. [passage omitted] On the other hand, there is a wish  on behalf of Hungary -- since we have a fait accompli produced  by the tragic history of the 20th century -- that the Hungarians  beyond our border should, within the given conditions, be given  the rights of autonomy by which they can preserve their  identity. If a basic treaty does not settle these two unsolved  issues, it is worthless.    I would like to add, and this is also included in our  program, that in the question of basic treaties, coordination  has to be carried out with the would-be opposition prior to  signing. Prior to ratification, the democratic institutions of  the Hungarians beyond the border also have to be involved.    [Correspondent] [passage omitted] How do you evaluate the  statement of [MSZP Chairman] Gyula Horn that there is no need  for the office dealing with the affairs of Hungarians beyond the  borders?    [Tabajdi] [passage omitted] It is debatable how this office  should be run, however, it is absolutely necessary. [passage  omitted] So, regarding Hungarians beyond the borders, the new  government, shortly after assuming power, has to lay down the  basic principles, just as the Antall government did very  correctly in 1992. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] What does the MSZP intend to do with Duna  TV?    [Tabajdi] I wrote an article in NEPSZABADSAG on 11 April  that  a turnabout was needed in Hungarian minority policy. One of the  sentences in this article was that despite all the  organizational imperfections and personal monopolizing, Duna TV  filled a gap of decades. [passage omitted] Obviously, Duna TV  has to be maintained. We think that it has to be maintained by  the budget. [passage omitted]</p>

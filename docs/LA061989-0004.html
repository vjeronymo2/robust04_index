			<p><P> June 19, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Several senior members of the South-West Africa People's Organization who  fought a guerrilla war for independence for more than two decades returned from  exile to lead the organization in U.N.-supervised independence elections for  Namibia in November. Kissing the tarmac after stepping from the plane carrying  100 returnees, SWAPO Politburo member Hage Geingob said it was "a dream come  true after 27 years." The returning exiles include a number of senior members  of SWAPO, including Information Secretary Hidipo Hamutenya and Foreign Affairs  Secretary Theo Ben-Gurirab. The date for the return of SWAPO leader Sam Nujoma  has not been announced.  </P></p>

			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / The FT Interview: Challenges facing heir apparent - Wolfgang Schauble, second-in-command to the German chancellor, talks to Quentin Peel and Andrew Gowers The contrast could scarcely be greater. Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, is a great bear of a man with a palpable physical presence as he bursts into a political meeting. He is also a master of the art of ambiguity, of calculated blundering and mumbling, all part of the eternal German search for consensus, the essence of his coalition government. Mr Wolfgang Schauble, his closest political confidant and all-but-anointed heir, is a slight figure, precise in both word and movement. He is like a self-effacing second in the corner of a heavyweight boxing champion. The assassination attempt which left him paralysed and wheelchair-bound 18 months ago has, if anything, accentuated the contrast. Where the chancellor strides on to a platform, his second-in-command must laboriously wheel himself to the podium. Where the chancellor towers over his audience, Mr Schauble must peer past the microphone with a self-deprecating grin. Yet both men share the same acute political instinct, a love of intrigue and infighting, an instinct for the political jugular, and a considerable respect for and loyalty to each other. Mr Kohl is the unity chancellor, the man who spotted the brief moment when it was possible to bring the two halves of Germany back together. Mr Schauble negotiated the unification treaty, screwing the nuts and bolts into place. Mr Schauble also represents the new generation in the German leadership, the first to reach the top who cannot remember the Second World War. If he does succeed to the party leadership and the chancellorship for which he is so obviously being groomed, his task will be to cope with the post-unification trauma, and the challenge of Germany's search for its international identity. He is in little doubt of the political, psychological and physical challenge he faces. 'We have quite enough political problems to deal with during this unification period,' he says. 'Those who have to take government responsibility at a time of such huge changes do not have it very easy. You can see that from the opinion polls.' Yet he was as shocked as any by the recent state election results in Schleswig-Holstein and his own home state of Baden-Wurttemberg, showing a sharp increase in support for the parties of the extreme right-wing. 'The election result is a bitter defeat for the big democratic parties,' he comments. 'These were protest votes, not against a particular party, but rather against those in power in general. 'The cause is a general insecurity of all citizens about whether those responsible, in central government and the states, are capable of dealing with the problems the people are facing. We must take this vote very seriously.' Just one week before, commenting on the rise of the far right in the elections in France, Mr Schauble had warned: 'Nobody is entirely immune from such a development.' Yet he is firmly convinced that Germany can and will deal with the economic and social problems arising from unification, and the search for a national role. Like the chancellor, he refuses to be downcast by the cost of subsidies for the collapsed economy of the east. 'It is difficult, but not too difficult,' he says. 'We have to deal with a very strained budget. The capital markets are also rather stretched, but they are capable of handling it.' He understands the prevailing gloom in the business community, but refuses to share it. The private sector is worried at the scale of the task in east Germany, on top of the country's commitments to eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. What is left of east German industry is facing a disastrous collapse in exports to the rest of eastern Europe, when it is still not capable of competing for new markets in the west, he agrees. And on top of that, the outlook for the world economy is bleak, and there is a real danger of failure in the Gatt trade liberalisation talks. 'All these things together have their effect on the entrepreneurial class, which has got used to 10 years of uninterrupted growth. They see a slight weakening (in the German economy) as a dramatic development. One must take this gloomy mood seriously, but if you look for the real causes you can be a bit more relaxed.' One clear hope he has is that the completion of the single market in the European Community will bring a new boost to economic growth. But he admits there is a growing mood of questioning over Europe in Germany. He pinpoints three causes: the lack of political union to counterbalance economic and monetary union will lead to financial instability; the additional financial burdens of the EC are excessive, on top of the cost of unification and eastern Europe; and the security reason for western European integration (protection in the east-west conflict) has vanished with the end of the Cold War. Of the latter cause for doubt, he says: 'I don't think that is right. Precisely because of the end of the east-west confrontation, given the proliferation of unpredictable developments not only in eastern Europe but in the Mediterranean area, we need integration in western Europe all the more.' He is worried that Germany's partners do not see that need - and the need to involve Germany - so clearly. 'I think our western friends should think very hard about how the federal republic, sitting in the middle of Europe, can be ever more firmly anchored in western Europe, and not tempted backwards and forwards between east and west.' Such a scenario, he says, cannot be in the interests of Germany's western friends. 'We are always the one confronted most immediately with developments in eastern Europe. Our neighbours must resist the temptation to use the federal republic as a sort of cordon sanitaire to protect themselves against the developments in eastern Europe. That would not be a good development for Europe.' He fears that there might be a temptation in western Europe to acknowledge the big problems in the east and the threat of migration, but look at it simply as a problem for the Germans. 'That would be very shortsighted,' he says. As for economic and monetary union in the EC, he is convinced that it is right and that the criteria agreed at Maastricht are adequate. But if at the end of the decade 'the Europeans don't want it, there will be no court of appeal where one can lodge a complaint and say the law must be fulfilled'. He is less passionate on this score than Mr Kohl, although 'it would be a mistake' not to take the opportunity. The one real spark of passion comes with the suggestion that Germany might be using its new-found unity and sovereignty to dominate its European partners. 'Who says that?' he snaps, but then relaxes. 'We Germans must understand that such rapid changes as we have seen in Europe will also be critically debated by our friends. I don't think we have too much cause to feel sensitive.' He does believe that, so far, the German government has dealt calmly and correctly with its new role. It has abandoned any claim to eastern territories, or any questioning of its frontiers. It celebrated the 'fantastic events' of unification in a controlled way. 'We celebrated unity with violins, not with trumpets,' he says. 'That was no bad thing. We have had enough brass bands in our history, and that was not to our advantage, nor that of Europe.' There is a single-minded, ambitious aggressive streak in Mr Schauble which his opponents perceive. There is a softening, a deepening in his character which others are convinced has come from his close encounter with death and his subsequent paralysis. He is himself very conscious of the physical challenge ahead. 'I am not sure how it will look in five years' time,' he says. 'I am watching myself closely.' In the meantime, he shows remarkable self-confidence, and appears to revel in the daily political challenge. 'My colleagues are content, I am content and the opposition is content. That is no bad thing.' A politician to the bitter end.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PERSONAL FILE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1942 Born Freiburg.

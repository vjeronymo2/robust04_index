			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Watmoughs shows 24% improvement to Pounds 6.37m WATMOUGHS (Holdings), the Bradford-based printer, yesterday reported a 24 per cent increase in first-half pre-tax profits and an improvement in its interim dividend. Pre-tax profits increased to Pounds 6.37m in the six months to June 30 against Pounds 5.12m in the year-ago period on turnover which grew by 18 per cent to Pounds 65.5m (Pounds 55.5m). Interest costs fell to Pounds 76,000 (Pounds 164,000). Earnings per share improved to 13.38p (11.14p) out of which the group is paying an increased dividend of 3p per share compared with 2.7p at the interim stage last year. In addition the group is proposing a 1-for-1 scrip issue 'in view of the substantial increase in the market price of the company's shares' which has more than doubled over the past two years. Yesterday the shares closed up 16p to 748p. The board has also proposed the early redemption of the group's 5 per cent and 6 per cent preference shares. The proposals are subject to shareholder approval. Mr Patrick Walker, chairman and chief executive, said the group's UK activities 'continued to benefit from a slight improvement in the overall level of demand, our capital investment programme over recent years (which has totalled Pounds 100m), and firm management and financial controls.' He said the slight upturn in demand in the UK experienced towards the end of last year continued throughout the 1993 first half 'with an improving trend in the second quarter.' Mr Walker added that moves by a number of newspapers to produce colour tabloid sections had resulted in an increase in demand for web-offset printing. 'It is not a sellers' market, but there is certainly an increase in demand,' he said. Over the past few months Watmoughs has won a number of new newspaper printing contracts, including part of the new colour tabloid for the Mail on Sunday and the new Observer colour supplement. Elsewhere, Mr Walker said the group's new Spanish printing operations came on stream progressively during the second quarter and produced a small initial pre-tax profit contribution, as did the group's Revai Nyomda Hungarian subsidiary, which 'continued to make good progress.'</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> Item VIII_Documentation of Prenegotiation Objectives <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> DFARS section 215.807(b) is added to emphasize the requirement for documentation of the disposition of audit findings and recommendations in prenegotiation objectives. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> Item IX_Industrial Modernization Incentives Program (IMIP) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> DFARS section 215.870 and the clause at section 252.215&hyph;7003 were deleted effective January 14, 1993, by Departmental Letter 93&hyph;001, to reflect cancellation of the DoD industrial modernization incentive program. The program was cancelled September 18, 1992 by the Deputy Secretary of Defense. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> Item X_Extension of Set-Aside Authority <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> DFARS sections 219.000, 226.7000, and the clause at 252.219&hyph;7003 are revised to implement section 801 of the Fiscal Year 1993 Defense Authorization Act. Section 801 of Public Law 102&hyph;484 codified and extended authorities provided under section 1207 of Public Law 99&hyph;661 through Fiscal Year 2000. A new paragraph (c) is added to section 219.502&hyph;2&hyph;70 to implement section 801(g) by establishing a process for determining whether use of small disadvantaged business (SDB) set-asides has caused a particular industry to bear a disproportionate share of contracts awarded by a particular contracting activity to achieve its SDB goal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> Item XI_Certificate of Competency <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> This converts the interim rule, published as Item X of DAC 91&hyph;5 to a final rule with no revision. The interim rule implemented section 804 of the Fiscal Year 1993 Defense Authorization Act. DFARS section 219.602&hyph;1 was amended and a provision at section 252.219&hyph;7009 was added to require contracting officers to notify a small business concern, in writing, of a determination of nonresponsibility and of the concern's right to request the Small Business Administration to make a determination of the concern's responsibility. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> Item XII_Small Business Subcontracting Plan <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> This revises and finalizes the interim rule published as Item XIII of DAC 91&hyph;5. DFARS sections 215.605 and 236.602&hyph;1 are revised to elaborate on the requirement to evaluate the extent of participation of small and small disadvantaged businesses in performance of a contract. DFARS section 219.705&hyph;2(d) is revised to cross reference section 215.605. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> Item XIII_Surety Bond Waiver Reporting <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> DFARS section 219.808&hyph;1(b)(iv) is added to require contracting officers to prepare quarterly reports on contract awards where Miller Act requirements for performance and payments bonds are waived under 8(a) construction contracts. Report Control Symbol DD&hyph;ACQ(AR)1930 is assigned to this requirement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> Item XIV_Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> This item converts the interim rule published as Item XV of DAC 91&hyph;5 to a final rule with no change. This rule extended the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program through September 30, 1996. It also revised part 219 to (1) state A&hyph;E services in support of military construction projects or military family housing are exempt from the program; and (2) address responsibility for reinstatement of small business set-asides. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> Item XV&hyph;Pilot Mentor-Protege Program <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> DFARS is amended to incorporate the DoD policy for the Pilot Mentor-Protege Program as a new appendix I. Conforming changes have been made to subpart 219.71 to correctly reference the new appendix and to delete redundant material. This implements section 813 of the Fiscal Year 1994 Defense Authorization Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> Item XVI_Ammunition and Explosives <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> DFARS section 223.370&hyph;4(b)(1)(ii) and the clause at section 252.223&hyph;7002 are revised to clarify policy regarding safety precautions for ammunition and explosives. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> Item XVII_Storage and Disposal of Toxic and Hazardous Materials <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The interim rule published as Item XX of DAC 91&hyph;5 is converted to a final rule. The interim rule added DFARS subpart 223.71 and the clause at section 252.223&hyph;7006 to incorporate the requirements of 10 U.S.C. 2692, as amended by section 2852 of the Fiscal Year 1993 Defense Authorization Act. An editorial correction is made at section 252.223&hyph;7006. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> Item XVIII_North American Free Trade Agreement <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> This is an interim DFARS rule that was effective January 1, 1994. The rule was issued December 23, 1993 by Departmental Letter 93&hyph;010. Chapter Ten of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) Implementation Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;182) requires the three parties to the agreement, (the United States, Canada, and Mexico) to eliminate ``buy national'' restrictions on nondefense-related purchases by the federal governments. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) was amended, effective January 1, 1994, but implementation of NAFTA also required revision of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) to integrate Buy American Act and Balance of Payment Program waivers necessitated by NAFTA with similar existing Department of Defense waivers for countries with memoranda of understanding or other international agreements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> Item XIX_Angolan Petroleum <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> DFARS sections 225.702(2), 225.703, 225.704, and 252.225&hyph;7011 are deleted to remove the restriction on acquisition of petroleum products originating in Angola. Pursuant to section 842 of the Fiscal Year 1993 Defense Authorization Act, Presidential Determination No. 93&hyph;32 certified that free, fair, and democratic elections had taken place in Angola. This action ended the DoD prohibition on purchasing of petroleum products originating in Angola. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> Item XX_Restrictions on Hand or Measuring Tools <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> DFARS sections 225.7002, 252.225&hyph;7012, and 252.225&hyph;7015 are revised and 225.7003 is eliminated to combine the restriction on hand or measuring tools with the restriction on food, clothing, fabrics, and specialty metals. These items are subject to the same restrictions as a result of section 9009 of Public law 101&hyph;165 and similar restrictions in subsequent Defense Appropriations Acts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

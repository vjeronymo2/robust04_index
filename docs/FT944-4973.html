			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Kidder Peabody PaineWebber's decision yesterday to jettison the Japanese operations of Kidder Peabody, its recently acquired subsidiary, was doubly significant. Not least, it demonstrated PaineWebber's determination to dispel doubts about the wisdom of its purchase. Since October, when the group bought its majority shareholding, PaineWebber has moved fast to address Kidder's problems. The bulk of the esoteric mortgage-backed bond portfolio has been dismantled. The termination of the Tokyo equity operations is only the latest in a series of far-reaching, cost-cutting measures. Also significant was PaineWebber's conclusion that Kidder's Tokyo operations were dispensable even though they were profitable. That underlines the problems facing all Tokyo-based broking houses. The volatility and volumes on the equity market have been so bad that most domestic brokers are incapable of making money. Non-Japanese houses, less constrained by ministry of finance regulations, are doing better. But the huge costs of doing business in Japan mean they are not particularly profitable: over the past 24 months two other non-Japanese groups preceded PaineWebber in selling their Tokyo Stock Exchange memberships because the benefits failed to match the costs. PaineWebber may find the queue for its Tokyo membership is short. It may confer lower dealing costs, but trading volumes need to be high to compensate for the additional infrastructure and capital required. The last time a membership came up, the ministry of finance had to twist arms before a buyer materialised. Since then conditions have deteriorated further.</p>

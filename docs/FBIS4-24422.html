			<p>BFN     [Text] According to the figures released by the provincial  meeting on employment held on 28 May, last year 771,000 persons  in the province registered with proper units for seeking jobs.  Of them, 473,000 persons obtained employment through the  introduction by employment service centers, 186,000 persons were  placed in urban areas, and more than 70 percent of them were  employed through the two-way choice between the employing units  and employees. This shows that the province has basically  defined the dominant position of market-oriented employment.    Since the beginning of last year, labor departments at all  levels in the province have further emancipated the mind,  renewed ideas, and continuously expanded the employment sphere  based on the characteristics of market-oriented employment, thus  making the province's employment work witness a new situation of  reform and development. The old employment concept that existed  for scores of years has begun to be broken, and new employment  ideas and modes have occupied a dominant position. Instead of  squeezing in state-owned units, urban job-seekers have vied with  each other in working for nonstate-owned sector of the economy,  such as urban collective enterprises, foreign-invested  enterprises of three types, and township and town enterprises.  Along with the changes in the people's employment ideas,  flexible employment forms have also begun to emerge. In the  past, once a person was employed, he obtained a life-long job.  And most workers were long-term fixed workers, and the form of  employment was unitary. At present, the province is  experiencing the coexistence of diverse and flexible employment  forms, such as contract workers, temporary workers, seasonal  workers, odd-job workers, and hour-based workers. The  employment pattern of separating urban areas from rural areas  has also been broken. Instead of mainly employing urban  job-seekers, the province has begun to employ job-seekers in  both urban and rural areas. According to the unified arrangement  of the state, the province has conducted [words indistinct] for  employment of rural people and has begun to manage in a unified  manner the transfer and flow of the 10 million surplus laborers  in rural areas. Some economically developed cities have begun  to carry out unified arrangements for urban and rural laborers.  In addition, export of laborers has developed further. Last  year, the province exported some 2 million workers abroad, and  the situation of making unified arrangements for employment in  urban and rural areas also began to emerge in this regard.</p>

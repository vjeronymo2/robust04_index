Palomar, the club has provided the  magazine with spectacular color photographs of a comet, a solar prominence and  several nebulae. . . . "As professional astronomers produce fewer and fewer  pictures, amateurs are increasingly turning out stunning ones," says the  article. It calls the club's 22-inch telescope "an amateur astronomer's dream."  Matt Lait and Herman Wong  </P></p>

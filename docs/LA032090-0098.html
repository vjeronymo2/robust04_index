			<p><P> March 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> POINDEXTER IMAGE GOES FROM JAUNTY TO STEELY  </P> <P> Former National Security Adviser John M. Poindexter smiles rarely and takes  notes often at his Iran-Contra trial.  </P> <P> Because he has not testified yet, the jury must rely a good deal on its mental  snapshots of his image as he sits at a table opposite them every day. But that  image poses a riddle.  </P> <P> The balding retired rear admiral has grown a mustache since his days in the  Ronald Reagan Administration as Oliver L. North's boss. When he takes off his  glasses, the mustache softens his manner. In fact, it lends him a jaunty,  sportsman's outdoors look, as if he were a British country squire.  </P> <P> But, when he puts his glasses back on, as he does often to read and take notes,  his features seem to freeze into stern, steely coldness. The glasses and  mustache combine to complete a look that recalls the balding, mustached old  Bolshevik of Stalin's day, V. M. Molotov.  </P> <P> By now, North has fashioned a public image as a Marine of great derring-do and  energy; a glib patriot who could charm and tongue-tie doubting congressmen with  ease; a fervent worker who knew how to get things done, no matter what the  cost; a government official who did not hesitate to speak his mind or change  dreams into action. He is a hero to many Americans and earns thousands of  dollars per speech these days.  </P> <P> Yet, with no television cameras present, the jurors in the Poindexter trial  watched a far different Ollie North for his four days in the witness box.  Hesitant, forgetful, wearing a puzzled brow, North professed an extraordinary  failure to remember where he was and what he did on some of the most momentous  days of his life. He hemmed and hawed about what he did admit remembering.  </P> <P> Prosecutor Dan K. Webb accused North of trying to protect his old boss. Yet  North's replies were not always helpful to Poindexter. In bringing up the  charge that Poindexter conspired with North to hide what had happened in the  Iran-Contra affair, defense attorney Richard W. Beckler asked North: "Do you  remember Adm. Poindexter saying, 'Let's keep this from Congress?' "  </P> <P> "I do not recall him saying that."  </P> <P> "Because nobody said that, isn't that right?"  </P> <P> "I do not recall what anyone did or did not say."  </P> <P> North sat stiffly upright throughout most of his testimony, frequently asking  that he be allowed to refresh his memory by consulting his testimony in his own  trial or to Congress. He would then go through the transcripts methodically,  his fingers seeking pages almost daintily.  </P> <P> But his memory did manage to eke out some replies when he felt pressed by an  angry Judge Harold H. Greene or badgered by prosecutor Webb. And, in one moment  most damaging to Poindexter, he admitted under blistering questioning by Webb  that, following his old boss's instructions to take care of a group of  congressmen, he had marched into the White House Situation Room and lied to  them.  </P> <P> The courtroom drama starred two federal judges one morning. Judge Greene  presided, as usual, but a colleague, U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin, sat  in the witness box. Sporkin was testifying about his dealings with the White  House during his days as general counsel of the Central Intelligence Agency.  </P> <P> After the oath, Sporkin was asked his occupation. "U.S. district judge," he  replied.  </P> <P> "Similar to Judge Greene?" the prosecutor asked.  </P> <P> "Well," Sporkin said, "nobody is similar to Judge Greene. I would like to  aspire to be Judge Greene."  </P> <P> That drew a pronouncement from Greene: "He's a very truthful witness."  </P> <P> After Sporkin completed his testimony, Greene released him and said: "Next time  you need a witness to stand in, Judge Sporkin, I will be glad to reciprocate."  </P> <P> But Sporkin looked up to the bench and told Greene: "It's better up there."  </P> <P> The 67-year-old Judge Greene, known best for breaking up the AT&amp;T telephone  monopoly in a celebrated antitrust case, dominates proceedings. He is somewhat  avuncular, a pleasant, good-humored jurist who leans back in his chair with an  elfin slip of a smile on his round face. Yet, if annoyed, he can whip everyone  back into line with scathing wit. There is no doubt who's in charge in his  courtroom.  </P> <P> Greene clearly does not like slick lawyers who try to confuse jurors. The judge  took over the questioning himself when defense attorney Joseph Small drew  replies from a specialist that made it seem that Adm. Poindexter had used his  computer for less than a minute on the day he is accused of deleting more than  5,000 messages from it.  </P> <P> "I'm not going to let you mislead the jury," Greene said. His questions then  established that it may be possible to destroy a multitude of messages in less  than a minute because computers work so fast that they measure time in  nanoseconds, otherwise known as split seconds.  </P> <P> There was little doubt that the judge often lost patience with North as a  witness. "Please just answer the question," he admonished him one day. "For a  man who quibbles over whether something happened in May rather than June, you  do embroider other answers. Just answer the question."  </P> <P> At other times, the judge made his point by feigning infinite patience. When  defense attorney Beckler asked for a few moments delay, Greene retorted: "I  have a lifetime appointment. If necessary, I can listen to Col. North until my  term runs out."  </P> <P> The judge has trouble hiding his feelings. When North, whose testimony  sometimes contradicted testimony he had given elsewhere, said: "All the  testimony I have given before every tribunal has been accurate and true,"  Green's eyebrows arched noticeably. But he said nothing.  </P> <P> By most accounts, Fawn Hall, Col. North's secretary, was the most glamorous  figure in the Iran-Contra affair, and she held the attention of every juror as  she testified in the Poindexter trial. She is a thin, very pale young woman  with a bounty of long blond hair like that of the medieval princesses in the  illustrations for old Sir Walter Scott novels.  </P> <P> Speaking so rapidly that the judge had to slow her down to let the court  reporter catch up, Hall told her well-known tale of helping North shred and  steal government documents as authorities closed in on him at the end of the  Iran-Contra affair. Also, she delivered a few rapid-fire tributes to the  patriotism of her old boss.  </P> <P> After she had completed her testimony, Judge Greene told her that she would no  longer be needed at the trial.  </P> <P> "You're free to do whatever you want," he said, "within reason."  </P></p>

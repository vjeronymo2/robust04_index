			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Marat Salimov, under the rubric "Reforming the </F> Banking System": "Bankers and Entrepreneurs Have Agreed To  Maintain the Status Quo"]    [Text] The Central Bank of Russia is opposing  significant changes in the established banking system. This was  shown by the meeting of representatives of commercial banks,  trading companies, and the Central Bank of Russia, held  yesterday at the Russian Chamber of Trade and Industry and  devoted to discussion of proposed banking legislation. At this  meeting the Central Bank came out against the formation of a  federal reserve system. It is notable that the representatives  of the commercial banks did not insist on any substantial change  in banking law either.    Yesterday's meeting of representative of state and  commercial  structures was organized to discuss legislative proposals to  amend and supplement the Law "On the Central Bank of the RSFSR  (Bank of Russia)" and the Law "On Banks and Banking in the  RSFSR," which are planned to be put on the agenda in parliament  in the near future. Konstantin Lubenchenko, head of the legal  department of the Central Bank, spoke at the meeting. He stated  that the proposed bill on the Central Bank is an attempt to  increase the degree of the bank's independence of the  government, which will make it possible to implement financial  and emissions policy more effectively. An innovation in the bill  is the point on forming a consulting council at the Central  Bank, consisting of representatives of leading banks and banking  associations, national economic specialists, specialists from  financial bodies, and scholars. In Lubenchenko's opinion, the  activities of this council will enable the Central Bank  management to reach decisions efficiently on the most important  matters touching the interests of all agents of the financial  system without exception.    In all, Lubenchenko's talk showed that the Central Bank has  no interest at all in significant change in the Russian banking  system. It is noteworthy that Lubenchenko touched especially on  the issue of the prospects of establishing a federal reserve  system in Russia on the model of the one that exists in the  United States. In the opinion of the Central Bank  representative, which from all appearances coincides with the  opinion of the bank management, "At the present time there is no  need to copy the American plan, nor do conditions for it exist."  Furthermore, he said, in the States the Federal Reserve System  is in fact being subjected to harsh criticism and is blamed for  the collapse of national monetary policy. A similar opinion was  expressed on this matter on the same day at a Central Bank  briefing (see the article on this same page).    It is noteworthy that neither this position nor the proposed  bills aroused any particular condemnation from those present. It  is true that representatives of the commercial banks stated that  it would be wise for the bills to stipulate specifically what  constitutes banking activity as compared to other types of  entrepreneurial activity. At present, in their opinion, these  specifics are not being taken into account, and the authorities  have an opportunity to receive unobstructed information which  bank clients do not have an interest in divulging. Furthermore,  it was suggested that the legal basis of registration be put in  more concrete terms and that the sphere of activity of bank  associations and councils be defined more specifically. But not  one representative of the commercial banks spoke in favor of a  fundamental reform of the banking system, for example for  conversion of their own bank into a federal reserve bank.  <H5>  Primary Tasks of the Bank of Russia (From the Draft </H5> Law)     -  Ensuring the stability of the Russian Federation  monetary unit and increasing its purchasing power;    -  Organizing  and supporting the uninterrupted functioning of the payment  mechanism in the national economy;    -  Development of the Russian  Federation's credit and banking system by all possible  means;    -  Conducting currency regulation and monitoring in  conformity with Russian Federation law.  <H5>  Documents Necessary for Foreign Legal Persons To Receive a </H5> Banking License (From the Draft Law):     -  a decision of the  foreign founder on its participation in founding a bank in  Russia or opening a branch;    -  a document that confirms the status  of the founder and its published balances for the last 3  years;    -  the written consent of the monitoring agency of the  founder's country of residence to its participation in forming a  bank in Russia or opening a branch.   <FIG ID=JPRS-USR-038-32A>      Organizational Structure of the U.S. Federal Reserve System </FIG></p>

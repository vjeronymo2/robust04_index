			<p>BFN     [Text] The fourth session of the Central Committee of the  Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] was held in Matola  recently. The final communique reflects the issues discussed at  the meeting:    The Mozambican Government continues to strictly adhere to  the  General Peace Accord. Although the international community is  assisting in the implementation of the General Peace Accord and  in the democratization of the Mozambican society, Frelimo's  Central Committee noted with apprehension the patronizing  attitude that some members of the international community have  shown toward Renamo on a number of occasions, as well as the  actions aimed at downplaying the seriousness of the violations  of the General Peace Accord, and underestimating Renamo's  maneuvers to avoid fulfilling the agreed timetables.    In complete disregard of its public statements on the  upholding of democracy and human rights, Renamo continues to  prevent the access and movement of citizens in areas under its  control, thereby violating the General Peace Accord. Moreover,  Renamo prohibits economic activities -- namely, hunting,  fishing, and logging in areas under its control in violation of  the spirit and letter of the General Peace Accord and the  Constitution of the Republic.</p>

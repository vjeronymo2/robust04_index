			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Observer: Worthy suggestion Accountancy firm Touche Ross reckons that football clubs are underestimating their assets by failing to disclose the value of players on their balance sheets. The remedy, surprise, surprise, is to employ a professional valuer to estimate players' worth and publish the figure in the accounts - someone like, say, Touche Ross. But when it comes to disclosing the fees Touche Ross charged Manchester United for just such a service last year, the firm is rather less keen on disclosure. 'It was done professionally, for a modest fee,' comes the response.</p>

It appreciates Albanian foreign  policy regarding the solution of the crisis in the region and it  is for an extended autonomy of Kosova, Danish foreign minister,  Petersen, said today at a joint press conference with his  Albanian counterpart, Serreqi.    Mr. Petersen said that Denmark will contribute to Albania's  support in the European Community and to its closer relations  with the NATO. Mr. Petersen mentioned education, health, and  legislation as the fields in which Denmark may assist Albania.  He confirmed that his government has accorded to Albania a fund  of 15 million corona which will be delivered soon.    Concerning the situation in the region and considering the  Kosova question as fundamental for the resolution of the crisis,  Mr. Petersen said he was for an extended autonomy of Kosova and  a continuous pressure on the Serbs.    Mr. Serreqi confirmed that in the talks they had, they also  discussed the creation of a legal basis which will carry forward  the bilateral relations. These relations will be based on some  agreements, among which he mentioned the removal of double  taxation, protection of investments, cooperation in economy,  education and culture.    In response to a question regarding a UN approval for the  dispatch of Turkish troops in Bosnia, Mr. Serreqi said that the  process of peace calls for a great support and not prejudices.  In his opinion, the countries that responded to the UN appeal  should be congratulated.    Asked whether the stand of Denmark regarding the solution of  the crisis in the former Yugoslavia is the same as that of the  12 European countries, Mr. Petersen replied that the community  has decided to act in unison on this issue, underlining that the  plan for joint international actions is the basis for a peaceful  solution. The plan of the community appeals to the Serbs of  Bosnia to make territorial concessions.    In reply to a question on the coincidence of the visits of  the three foreign ministers to Albania and the visit of  President Berisha to Great Britain, Mr. Serreqi said that this  is related with a re-appreciation of the Albanian factor in the  Balkans and an estimation for the Tirana foreign policy.</p>

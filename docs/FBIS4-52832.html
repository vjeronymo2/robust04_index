			<p>BFN     [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry  [MITI] said on 13 May it plans to drastically revise postwar  Japan's trade policy, now that the World Trade Organization  (WTO) is due to set sail in January 1995. The ministry will do  self-criticism on the past practice of addressing issues as they  occur instantaneously, using managed trade techniques and  holding bilateral talks--mostly with the United States. It will  come up with a policy that gives weight to a free trade system  and emphasis to multinational talks.    Later this month, a WTO Division (headed by Professor Mitsuo  Matsushita of Seikei University) will be set up under the  Industrial Structure Council which is an advisory panel to the  MITI minister. Guidelines for new policy will be prepared by  next spring and Japan's change of its trade policy will be  formally reported to all countries in the first miniterial  meeting of the WTO.    The ministry plans to revise its policy because the scope of  the WTO operations -- being different from that of the GATT of  the past -- not only applies to trade of commodities, but also  extends to international economic rules, such as services,  intellectural property rights, and trade-related investments.  The WTO also bans gray measures like those seen in  self-controls on export.    Rules on the arbitration of disputes change from the current  consensus system of requiring unanimous approval by the  Arbitration Board to a negative consensus system wherein a  judgment cannot be overturned unless everyone on the board votes  for disagreement. As such, it has become easy for a judgment by  the Grievance Panel to be upheld. All this has prompted the  ministry to decide toward making the revision.    The ministry now is doing self-criticism, admitting the  practices it has indulged in--of taking actions instantaneously  when pressed by countries like the United States in trade  talks--are "things that lead to managed trade." The ministry  will clearly state in its policy that Japan will abide by the  WTO rules and will file complaints with the WTO even against the  United States when infractions of the rules occur.    Also regarding the Japan-U.S. semiconductor agreement which  is due to expire in the summer of 1996, Japan will negotiate  with the United States toward removing the controversial part  which can be interpreted as having made a commitment on market  shares of the foreign-made semiconductors.    In the new policy, the subjects to be discussed in the WTO  in  the future--such as the impact of labor, environment,  competitive policy, and investments on trade issues--will be  taken up. It will explain discussions need to take into account  the concerns of Asian nations lest these matters be linked to  protectionism. The abolition of export cartels in principle and  the problem of intra-keiretsu dealings in trade will be also  dealt with.</p>

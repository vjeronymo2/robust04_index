			<p>BFN     [Text] Belem, 4 Jun (DPA) -- The situation in Haiti and  electoral fraud charges in the Dominican Republic will focus the  attention of foreign ministers and top Latin American and U.S.  representatives at the 24th OAS General Assembly that will start  Monday in the Brazilian city of Belem.    Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim confirmed the  importance that the organization places on the Haitian crisis,  but he was skeptical about the possibility of increasing  pressure on the military regime led by General Raoul Cedras  through a total embargo against the Antillean country.    Diplomatic sources said they expect the Haitian issue to be  discussed next Tuesday, but it could also be discussed on  Sunday, at a meeting prior to the official assembly opening.    The most controversial issue is the use of force to  reinstate  President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who announced that he will  attend the Belem meeting, Amorin told the press.    The five-day meeting will mark the end of the mandate of  Brazilian Joao Baena Soares as head of the OAS for the past  decade. The meeting will give way to his elected successor,  Colombian President Cesar Gaviria. Gaviria, 47, should assume  the post by late August or September, after the runoff  presidential elections in Colombia.    The foreign ministers will also discuss the situation in the  Dominican Republic resulting from fraud charges, following the  recent presidential elections. Several countries of the region  announced they will not recognize the results of the elections  that gave a slight victory to incumbent President Joaquin  Balaguer over Social Democrat Francisco Pena Herrera.    Among other issues, the Belem meeting will deal with an  inter-American convention on women's rights, and the state of  the struggle against drug trafficking and gun running.</p>

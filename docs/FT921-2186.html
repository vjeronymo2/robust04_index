			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Schroders beats expectations with 64% advance to Pounds 52.1m SCHRODERS, the London-based international merchant banking group, raised its profits by 64 per cent in 1991, a year which, according to Mr Wim Bischoff, chief executive, turned out better than expected. Total disclosed group post-tax profits were Pounds 52.1m, up from Pounds 31.6m before an extraordinary profit in 1990. Analysts noted that Schroders' 1991 performance was also 10 per cent up on 1989, the best-ever year in the group's history. Disclosed earnings per share rose from 50.1p to 82.2p, and the total dividend is increased by 28 per cent from 14p to 18p. Dividend cover is 4.5 times disclosed profits. The improved profitability in 1991 seemed to reflect a successful year by all the group's main operations, and the absence of any problems comparable to those which hit its balance sheet in 1990 in the UK and US. Mr Bischoff said that 1991 had been a very good year for Schroders' operations in both London and Hong Kong. In New York, the results of Wertheim Schroder had been substantially improved, and transactions and revenues had both gone up. The Los Angeles operation was also doing well. There was also significant profits growth in the Japanese division, in spite of the problems in the country's securities industry. Venture capital and management buy-out operations increased funds under management to Dollars 1.5bn. During the year the group repaid Pounds 27.8m of debt, leaving only Pounds 10m of loan stock outstanding which matures in 2002. Schroders is one of the most strongly capitalised banks in the London market, with a risk asset ratio described as well over 16 per cent, twice the regulatory minimum. In the UK, the group's loan book rose from Pounds 732m in 1990 to Pounds 900m. Mr Bischoff said Schroders took advantage of widening margins to lend to good customers at a time when other banks were withdrawing from the market. Despite the profits growth of 1991, Mr Bischoff was cautious about prospects for the current year, which he said would be difficult. Schroders had some terrific opportunities outside the UK, but would stick to its traditional policy of trying to do a few things well. 'The high calibre of our staff worldwide enables us to face the present year with confidence,' Mr Bischoff said.</p>

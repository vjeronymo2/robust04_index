			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Computing: Win control of accounts Research carried out by a leading bank last year showed that about half of Britain's small businesses had a computer. Though no figures are available, from my own experiences, many businesses use computers only for word processing. Recently, one business delayed my appointment by two days because the owner and his secretary needed the time to complete the VAT returns. What a waste of resources. There are hundreds of computer accounting packages available today. Each targets a specific market. They range from multi-user, multi-module offerings that run on mainframe computers down to simple budgeting software written for a wide variety of home computers. I asked myself: 'Why didn't they use a computer and accounts software?' The opening sentence of one book on the subject suggests that 'making good use of accountancy software within your business is not difficult as long as you have good software and a reasonable understanding of accountancy practice'. Today, many new enterprises are started by people made redundant by large companies cutting back on their workforce. Their understanding of accountancy practice consists of a smart-suited accountant arriving in a large car and accompanied by a fat fee. The trend in accounts software is to make them simple. Software developers are stripping away the accountancy jargon and referring to items in everyday terms. The advertising for the latest contender to enter the PC accounts market, Visual Accounts, sums it up: 'No ledgers, no journals, no postings, no problems]' Money Manager has been the front-runner in simple accounts software, with thousands of copies sold to small businesses and home users. It is often castigated by reviewers in the computer press for being too simple. But Money Manager works under MS-Dos and today appears old-fashioned. I believe that Visual Accounts will take over a portion of Money Manager's market because it runs under Windows. Entering data into Visual Accounts takes no more time than writing the same details into a cash analysis book. The benefits include the ability to print an invoice by pressing a couple of keys, and the dreaded quarterly VAT return will take only a few minutes. The owner also gains instant access to more information about his business; income and expenditure for the past month, quarter, or year; instant balances in different accounts and aged debtors and creditors. Money Manager and Visual Accounts are not the strongest accounts packages for the PC but they are the simplest to use, with Visual Accounts possibly having the edge. Neither package has facilities for stock control. Neither would be suitable for a business with a substantial annual turnover. Nevertheless, they would help many owners gain control of their business rather than the business running their lives. Money Manager costs Pounds 49.95 inc. VAT and delivery.

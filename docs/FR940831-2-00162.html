To determine the type of coverage to price, Runzheimer contacted insurance agents in each area to obtain information on the typical policy. Listed below are the most common coverages, limits, and deductibles for the surveyed living-cost areas.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> Bodily Injury_$100,000/$300,000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Property Damage_$50,000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medical_$5,000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Uninsured Motorist_$100,000/$300,000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comprehensive_$100 Deductible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Collision_$250 Deductible  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In all areas, Runzheimer attempted to identify the most ``popular'' automobile insurance companies by analyzing market-share reports compiled by an industry rating bureau. The policy described above was then priced again this year for each location. Two or three price quotes were obtained for each area and averaged together to produce the final number for this component in each allowance area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5.3&blank;Public Transportation Methodology  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As was done last year, Runzheimer surveyed the cost of air fares as they relate to recreational travel. Runzheimer priced the lowest available round-trip air fare from each allowance area and the Washington, D.C., area to Los Angeles, California. Los Angeles was selected because it is a common point approximately equidistant from most of the allowance areas and the Washington, D.C., area. The cost of the trip from each allowance area to Los Angeles was compared with the cost of the trip from the Washington, D.C., area to Los Angeles to compute the public transportation category indexes. (See Appendix 11.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5.4&blank;Transportation Survey Results  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Runzheimer measured the costs for fuel, maintenance and oil, tires, licensing, taxes, depreciation, finance, and insurance for three types of automobiles in each allowance area and in the Washington, D.C., area to determine typical private transportation costs. Appendix 10 shows the cost of each of these items in each area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Runzheimer also measured the cost of recreational air travel from each allowance area and from the Washington, D.C., area to a common point within the contiguous 48 states. Appendix 11 shows the cost of these air fares and their relationship to the cost for the Washington, D.C., area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix 11 compares the total cost of the private transportation items for each vehicle in each allowance area with the total cost of the same items in the Washington, D.C., area. Appendix 11 also shows how the private and public transportation indexes were combined using expenditure weights derived from the CES data to produce final transportation indexes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final transportation indexes are used in Appendix 14 to derive the total overall index. (Refer to section 2.2 for a discussion of the general formulae and how the component indexes are combined.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

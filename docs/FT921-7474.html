			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Money growth lends weight to Bundesbank's caution GERMAN money supply growth accelerated again last month under the influence of continued heavy demand for credit, the Bundesbank reported yesterday. January's 9 per cent annualised increase in M3 followed a 5.8 per cent jump in December. M3 is the broad money supply measure comprising cash, current and savings accounts, sight deposits and time deposits of up to four years. Private sector borrowing in January was DM4.6bn (Pounds 1.6bn), compared with DM300m in month last year. Although the result was more or less in line with unofficial forecasts, it was still far above the Bundesbank's target range for M3 growth this year of between 3.5 per cent and 5.5 per cent. The figures added further weight to the bank's insistence that its tight controls, especially high interest rates, must be maintained in the interests of monetary stability and reducing inflation. The Bundesbank claimed yesterday, however, that the January surge was subject to special factors and stemmed in part from increased demand for credit in December spilling over into last month. The money supply increase for January was stated as a comparison with the final quarter of 1991, when M3 growth was speeding up, while the December figure related to the more stable situation during the last three months of 1990. Conditions in the wages market, another area of prime concern to the Bundesbank's policy-makers, remained tense yesterday. Banks throughout the country were hit by selective strikes among workers still pursuing a 10.5 per cent pay claim even though employers earlier this week imposed a 5 per cent award. Textile unions, due to start pay talks on March 17, approved a 9.5 per cent demand on behalf of the industry's 700,000 workforce. The government, meanwhile, maintained the deadlock in talks with public service workers. Federal, state and local authority employers refused for the second time to make a counter-offer to the union's claim for a 9.5 per cent wage increase plus DM550 more holiday pay, a package estimated to be worth 11 per cent. Mr Rudolf Seiters, interior minister and the government's main representative in the negotiations, said the discrepancy between the demand and resources available was so great that the employers were unable to make an offer. He had brought 'plenty of time' with him to the negotiating table, he said. The 1991 public service pay contract expired at the end of December.</p>

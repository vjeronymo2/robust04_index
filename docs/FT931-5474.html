			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / UK Company News: FNFC hit by finance problems at unit SHARES IN First National Finance Corporation, the consumer credit group, fell by 16p to 61p yesterday after the group ran into financing problems for its First National Bank unit. The group had intended to finance the core banking business through a combination of bank facilities and further asset sales including a second public securitisation planned for the first half of this year. However, FNFC's board said yesterday that after a 'disappointing' response from banks to a proposed new Pounds 100m facility for FNB, it had decided not to proceed with it. In addition FNFC said that although it has completed an asset sale of first mortgages raising about Pounds 47m, the group has been told that its proposed public securitisation to raise about Pounds 150m will not be able to proceed without satisfactory bank waivers. The waivers are required to eliminate technical breaches of the group's loan agreements which conflict with each other. FNFC's Board said it will be writing to the group's bankers seeking to maintain existing facilities while obtaining further funding.</p>

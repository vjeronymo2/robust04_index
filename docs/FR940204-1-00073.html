			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In 1982, a habitat conservation plan (HCP) was completed and a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 10(a) incidental take permit was issued to the cities of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Brisbane, Daly City, and South San Francisco and the county of San Mateo  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the endangered mission blue butterfly ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Icaricia icarioides  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> missionensis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), San Bruno elfin butterfly ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Incisalia mossii bayensis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and San Francisco garter snake ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Thamnophis sirtiralis tetrataenia <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HCP, entitled ``San Bruno Mountain Habitat Conservation Plan'' (U.S. Fish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Wildlife Service permit number PRT 2&hyph;9818), permanently protects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> about 1,115 hectares (2,752 acres) of natural habitat at this site. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conference report on the 1982 amendments to the Endangered Species Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of 1973 indicates that Congress intended HCPs to encompass both listed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and unlisted species, especially unlisted species that might later be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protected. Although the callippe silverspot butterfly was not included  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the section 10(a) permit, the San Bruno Mountain HCP included  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific considerations and provisions in the event it did become listed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the Service. Habitat of one of the two known extant populations of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the callippe silverspot butterfly is protected under this HCP. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permit allows for the loss of animals and habitat through urban  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development containing approximately 8 percent of the San Bruno Mountain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> population of the callippe silverspot butterfly. Although habitat is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protected, the Service is aware of numerous preserved specimens of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> callippe silverspot butterfly that have been collected recently on San  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bruno Mountain on lands where the animal is not protected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act and implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.21 for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> endangered species set forth a series of prohibitions and exceptions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that apply to all endangered wildlife. These prohibitions, in part,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States to take (including harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> kill, trap, capture, collect, or attempt any such activity), import or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> export, transport in interstate or foreign commerce in the course of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commercial activity, or sell or offer for sale in interstate or foreign  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commerce any such species. It also is illegal to possess, sell,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deliver, carry, transport, or ship any such wildlife that was taken  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> illegally. Certain exceptions can apply to agents of the Service and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State conservation agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibited activities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involving endangered animal species under certain circumstances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulations governing permits are at 50 CFR 17.22 and 17.23. Such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permits are available for scientific purposes, to enhance the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> propagation or survival of the species, and/or for incidental take in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> connection with otherwise lawful activities. Further information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarding regulations and requirements for permits may be obtained from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Office of Management Authority,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Permits Branch, 4401 North Fairfax Drive, room 420C, Arlington, Virginia  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 22203&hyph;3507 (telephone 703/358&hyph;2104).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Public Comments Solicited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service intends that any final action resulting from this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal will be as accurate and effective as possible. Therefore any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments or suggestions from the public, other concerned government  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies, the scientific community, industry, or any other interested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> party concerning any aspect of this proposal are hereby solicited.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments particularly are sought concerning:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Biological, commercial, trade, or other relevant data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerning any threat (or the lack thereof) to the callippe silverspot  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> butterfly, Behren's silverspot butterfly, and Alameda whipsnake;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

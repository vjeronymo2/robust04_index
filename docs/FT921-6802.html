			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Mexico hopes for market stability - The country's reform of compulsory savings funds THE Mexican Congress has approved sweeping reforms to the nation's compulsory pension and housing funds. The changes are expected to boost domestic savings by Dollars 1bn in the first year of operation, and in the longer term could make Mexico's notoriously volatile capital markets more stable. The new law, which becomes binding in May, requires employers to pay 2 per cent of employees' salaries into personal pension funds administered by the commercial banks, and 5 per cent of salary into personal housing funds administered by a reformed Infonavit, Mexico's housing agency. The scheme will run alongside the existing pay-as-you-earn social security system, under which 7 per cent of a worker's salary is paid into a government-administered scheme. The reformed pension fund scheme is likely to prove a bonanza for Mexico's 18 commercial banks, 11 of which have just been privatised, with the remaining seven on the block. The banks will administer - and receive commissions for - 10m to 12m new bank accounts as a result of the initiative. Mexico's central bank reckons the reforms will raise roughly 3bn pesos (Dollars 1bn) in savings in the first year. The pension funds will almost certainly be allowed to be partially invested in both the debt and equity of private sector companies, according to the Bank of Mexico, although the exact regulations governing the new law have yet to be worked out. Since the pension fund managers will be investing over a 30-year period, they are likely to buy long-term bonds from Mexican companies, says the bank. Until now, Mexican companies have been forced to borrow over the short term, partly because of Mexico's high inflation rate, but also due to the speculative interest of many Mexican investors. The effect of the reform on the stock market could be equally great. At present, says Mr Charles Alexander, of N. M. Rothschild, the investment bank which has a large representative office in Mexico City, there are no forced buyers of Mexican domestic shares, as institutions in, say, the US and the UK, are forced to buy their domestic stock. As a result, says Mr Alexander, it is often difficult to sell Mexican stocks since there are few investors willing to buy Mexican equity when the Mexican stock market falls. The lack of long-term institutional buyers also has exacerbated the volatility of the bourse. Under the scheme, all workers will be able, if they wish, to invest their money in the central bank - where the return will be fixed quarterly at an annual rate of 2 per cent or more in real terms, depending on the finance minister's interpretation of market conditions. Alternatively, workers can place their money in an investment fund offered by their chosen bank - but which could be insurance companies or stockbrokerages. Investment funds will face restrictions on how much of the money can be invested in any given asset class, but investments in equities and corporate bonds will, it appears, be allowed. Workers can, if they want, top up their savings beyond the 2 per cent of their salary. At present, most Mexicans do not have bank accounts, so if they want to save money they often buy consumer durables, such as cars, televisions or even bricks. Since workers will now be able to channel savings into the financial sector, Mexico's low savings rate should increase. The reforms of Infonavit are just as radical, since they will turn a construction agency into a housing bank. As in the past, each employer will pay 5 per cent of workers' salary into Infonavit. But workers will receive accounts detailing their credits, curbing under-invoicing by companies that had been common in the past. Infonavit will charge interest of 4 per cent in real terms to those borrowing to buy their homes. After deducting expenses, it will pay an interest rate to creditors that lets the agency break even. Those not eligible or able to acquire loans from Infonavit - mainly the relatively well-off - can draw down their credits at Infonavit after retirement. The reforms have upset Mexico's labour unions, which will no longer be able to hand out houses to workers, or receive kickbacks for favours rendered. Likewise, the business sector, while generally supportive of the changes, is angry it has to pay out another 2 per cent of wages without any increased productivity. By contrast, the financial sector, which stands to gain the most, can barely conceal its glee. The central bank reckons the additional pension savings will increase the average worker's pension by 25 per cent - although this would only apply to employees who had subscribed to the scheme through their working life.</p>

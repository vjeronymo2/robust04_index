			<p>BFN     [Text] Believe it or not, Sir Robin Mclaren is actually  going to miss the hordes of young Hong Kong reporters gathered  around the gates of his Beijing residence demanding a response  to China's latest attack on British Government policy. The  British Ambassador never looked particularly comfortable  surrounded by young women brandishing microphones just  centimetres from his nose but Sir Robin says he eventually  became "very fond" of his interrogators.    "I have a lot of admiration for them, it is not an easy job,  spending all that time outside the embassy trying to get me to  say something," Sir Robin said, in the relatively tranquil  surroundings of the palatial home he will vacate at the end of  next month after three turbulent years as Her Majesty's  ambassador to the People's Republic of China.    The sight of Sir Robin besieged by reporters will be perhaps  one of the most lasting images of his tenure in Beijing, a time  which saw Sino-British relations fall to their lowest point in  decades and Sir Robin's health suffer noticeably as a result.  After six months of fruitless negotiations on the political  future of Hong Kong, he was forced to return to London for an  operation on his back, which left him out of action for much of  the winter. But despite all the tensions and frustrations of  the last three years, Sir Robin says he has no regrets about  taking up one of the most difficult jobs in the British Foreign  Service.    "I was aware that the last few years of British rule in Hong  Kong were likely to be difficult but even if I knew the precise  nature of the problem that would not have affected my decision  to come here," he said. "It is a job I have always wanted to  do. My first posting after learning Chinese was in Beijing [in  1960] and so it has been a natural aspiration for me to do the  top job here."    Sir Robin said that he hoped to return to China as a private  citizen after his retirement from the Foreign Office, and was  looking for employment in a business which could keep him  "engaged" with the mainland and Hong Kong, where he served as  political adviser to the Governor from 1981 to 1985. "I have a  personal interest in the culture and the way of life," he said.  "I also have a great interest and affection for Hong Kong."    However, Sir Robin will not be offering his services to the  British Government as an "elder statesman" or adviser on China  policy. "We do not have the same system as in China and Japan,  once you retire, you retire," he said. "I do not expect to  offer advice or to be asked for advice. Yesterday's ambassador  is the least qualified to give advice."    Asked if this meant he thinks his outspoken predecessor, Sir  Percy Cradock, should refrain from his very public criticism of  the government's current policy on Hong Kong and China, Sir  Robin said: "I am not going to make any public comment on Sir  Percy, who is a good friend and respected colleague." The only  advice Sir Robin said he would give his successor, Len  Appleyard, would be to stress the need for "patience and  persistence" and "to respect but not to be cowed by the  Chinese". Advice, he says he has "tried" to live up to himself,  although he declined to say if he thought he had actually  succeeded.    Sir Robin was rather more forthright in his comments on the  Chinese Government and, in particular, the failure to reach an  agreement on the arrangements for the 1994 and 1995 elections in  Hong Kong. "There was insufficient willingness to compromise,  especially on the Chinese side," he said. "They had determined  that Governor (Chris) Patten's proposals violated the three  principles (adherence to the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the  Basic Law, and the relevant agreements and understandings  reached between the two sides) and they got caught up in their  own rhetoric.    "It would not have been possible to reach an agreement  unless  we had done what the Chinese wanted and abandoned our position,  but we would have then had to measure the Chinese proposals  against the need for open and fair elections in Hong Kong. Even  if we had done that, the proposals would still have to have been  passed by Legco [the Legislative Council], something the Chinese  did not understand."    Sir Robin said his biggest disappointment in the talks was  his failure to convince the Chinese that Britain did not have  any ulterior motive in pushing for greater democracy in Hong  Kong and engaging in massive infrastructure projects, such as  the new airport. "There was this suspicion and mistrust on the  Chinese side that we wanted to run away with the money," he  said. "That is not remotely true. Britain just wants the best  for the people of Hong Kong."    The ambassador was quick to point out however that he did  not  consider his chief interlocutor in the Sino-British talks, Vice-  Foreign Minister Jian Enzhu, to be naturally hostile or  suspicious towards Britain. Mr Jiang, he said, was a "skilled  and highly sophisticated diplomat," as was the director of the  Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, Lu Ping, but the older  leaders, who determine Hong Kong policy, had their "thoughts  conditioned by the civil war, the anti-Japanese war, and the  Korean War and that obviously affected their view of Britain in  Hong Kong".    Nevertheless, Sir Robin expressed confidence that China  would  not attempt to mould Hong Kong in its own image after the  handover in 1997; if anything, he said, the reverse would be  true.    While Hong Kong has dominated his three years as ambassador,  Sir Robin was also required to implement that famous quote from  Prime Minister John Major in Beijing three years ago that the  British Government would apply "unrelenting and unremitting"  pressure on China's human rights. Unrelenting and unremitting  pressure has never really been Sir Robin's style and while he  claims Britain has a "close and strong interest" in China's  human rights, nobody could say the ambassador has been ramming  the subject down the throats of Chinese Government officials.    Imprisoned Ming Pao journalist, Xi Yang, was a case in point  where Sir Robin raised the issue with the Chinese authorities  but did not pursue the matter with quite the vigor that perhaps  Mr Major's statement required of him. Sir Robin's hands were  tied to a certain extent by the row over Hong Kong but, even in  the best of circumstances, it is doubtful he would have taken a  higher profile on human rights.    Instead, Sir Robin emphasises the achievements of British  trade and industry in moving into the China market over the last  three years, pointing out that Britain's exports to China  increased by 72 percent last year over 1992 but ignoring the  fact that Britain still had a 587 million Pound (about HK$6.9  billion) trade deficit with the mainland at the end of 1993.    In all, Sir Robin may not have a lot to shout about as he  leaves Beijing but at least the storm over Hong Kong's political  future has subsided for a while, giving the outgoing ambassador  hope that when Britain finally relinquishes control of the  territory on June 30, 1997, the handover will be done in "an  atmosphere of cooperation and not recrimination".</p>

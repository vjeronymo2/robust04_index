			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Met and FBI to form joint fraud arm THE GOVERNMENT yesterday signed an unprecedented agreement with the US establishing a joint US/UK team of police officers to investigate fraud and financial crime in Britain's five dependent territories in the Caribbean. The accord to establish the joint investigation unit, to be based in Miami, Florida, follows growing US concern over the use of Anguilla, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Montserrat and the Turks and Caicos Islands as a base for financial fraud against Americans. Under yesterday's memorandum of understanding signed in Washington, two detective inspectors from the Metropolitan Police will join Federal Bureau of Investigation agents in Miami. It will operate initially for a two-year period. The team will largely be involved in intelligence and gathering evidence in cases of white-collar crime. They will begin work on about 50 outstanding cases of white-collar crime. These usually involve victims in the US. In most cases, if prosecution is obtained, it is likely to take place in the US. The territories are depending on the growth of the financial services sector as an important part of their economic development. According to Foreign Office officials, the agreement has been welcomed in the territories because they see that their financial sectors are attracting criminals, driving away good business. Mr Mark Lennox-Boyd, Foreign Office minister, said the aims of the agreement were to catch existing criminals, to dissuade others from using the territories as a base for fraud and to develop local expertise in tackling white-collar crime. This will be the first time US officials have been given law-enforcement rights in the dependent territories, although there is already co-operation between police forces in the Caribbean territories and the US on drugs trafficking and money laundering.</p>

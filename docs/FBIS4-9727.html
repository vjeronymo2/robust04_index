			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Profiles" of Ernesto Zedillo, presidential candidate of </F> the Mexican Institutional Revolutionary Party, PRI, comprising  excerpts from his past speeches and writings]    [Text]  <H5>  State </H5>   A modern state stands at the forefront of society's  progressive trends; it does not fear society's participation,  but, rather, encourages and fosters it. A modern state works  with society in taking steps toward development. To encourage  modernization, a modern state withdraws from activities in which  its contribution is possibly inconvenient because it discourages  the private sector's activities in its own areas, or because it  diverts resources to activities with a lower level of priority.    A modern state clearly understands increasing its direct  participation in certain economic activities means, given the  shortage of resources, a reduction of its participation in other  activities; therefore, what should or should not be done in the  area of economics should depend on society's real needs, thus  precluding, depending on the case, the false dilemmas that  result from misconstrued principles, as if such dilemmas could  be placed ahead of society.    A modern state does not relinquish economic leadership,  instead, it exercises it for the community's benefit, strictly  within its sphere of action. (Comments on Monterrey Governor  Jorge Trevino's fourth annual report, Monterrey, 15 March 1989).    Only in an efficient state which attentively attends to  those  areas in which its actions are strategic and have priority will  it be possible to make the actions of all the sectors converge  to achieve the nation's goals. (Meeting with Mexican Employers  Confederation, Mexico City, second half of 1989).    The Mexican state will not neglect its relations with other  countries, its sectors and social groups, or its citizens. The  state will efficiently fulfill its basic duties: guarantee the  de jure state and the people's security; reconcile the interests  of all groups; promote conditions for growth, which will foster  significant progress in Mexicans' well-being. The state's  modernization hinges on whether this mandate is observed.  Likewise, the state must direct social development by  channeling the initiatives of contending sectors.    In economics, it is the state's duty to promote, encourage,  guard, and coordinate national activities within the framework  of the Constitution of the republic and its laws, ensuring the  unrestricted exercise of established freedoms and the dignity of  the human being. It is the fulfillment of these goals that will  determine the exact magnitude of the Mexican state. There is no  other way; there cannot be any other way of gaging this.  (Meeting with the League of Revolutionary Economists,  Monterrey, N.L., 23 August 1989).    In Mexico, the crisis has also taught us lessons on certain  domestic economic matters. We have learned sources of  employment are lasting only when they are economically  productive. We have learned it is very risky not to maintain a  balance between the value of that which we produce and the value  of that which we spend. We have learned it was possible for the  state to be generous only to have inflation devour that which a  misconstrued lavishness attempted to grant. We have learned  high inflation undermines a government's popular support. We  have learned a company, in which the state owns a majority or  minority of shares, is still, after all, a company. We have  learned profitability and gains are not ethically execrable  values but, rather, they can combine individual initiative and  the well-being of all. We have learned, in short, the mixed  economy system, such as it is established in our Constitution,  is still preferable to ultraliberalism and excessive statism.  (National Economists Congress, Mexico City, 25 October 1989).  <H5>  Democracy </H5>   Society's general development can be conceived only in  democracy. Growth with stability is a requirement for firm  progress toward the democratic ideal, which, according to the  national project, is understood not only as a form of government  or a legal structure but as an improvement of the people's  living conditions at all levels, political, economic, social,  and cultural. We should always remember economic improvement  can only be justified as a national goal inasmuch as it results  in better living conditions for all Mexicans. (Meeting with the  National College of Economists in Toluca on 16 June 1989).    In a democracy, the state's leadership is society's  leadership exercised through the agencies society selects to  ensure the fulfillment of the people's will and the efficient  management of public affairs.    There are no power vacuums. The absence of state leadership,  or anarchy, is antidemocratic because it creates the conditions  to override the people's will through decisions of authoritarian  minorities. For this reason, the government in planning to  expand political democracy and improve the mechanisms for  agreement and social participation in the daily exercise of  authority.    We advocate neither uncompromising liberalism nor the  statism  that outrages the people's sovereignty, extremes that belong to  an antidemocracy. (Meeting with the Employers' Confederation of  the Mexican republic, Mexico City, second semester 1989).    Similarly, there is a general demand for more democracy.  Society eagerly desires new forms of consultation, agreement,  and negotiation in the political field. Social organizations  are demanding imaginative ways for rapprochement and cooperation  among government branches, the country's various regions, and  organizations. There is a pressing demand for a redefinition of  relations between the people and the state. (Meeting with the  PRI, Mexico City, 10 July 1989).  <H5>  Poverty </H5>   To break the grip of poverty, to eradicate it presupposes  fighting it at the source, at the root, where it is deeper, at  the root, where dissatisfaction is born and social  discouragement is created.    For Mexicans, justice is the challenge to meet. It is to  mount a frontal attack against poverty, without hesitation. The  elimination of extreme poverty, inequalities, backwardness, and  hardships multiplied by the crisis can wait no longer. We must  resume our growth while recovering our ability to feel  indignation over and take action against extreme poverty.  (Installation of the Popular Consultation Forum on Extreme  Poverty, National Palace, 21 February 1989).    We Mexicans are not indifferent to extreme poverty, which  reveals our insufficiencies and urges us to remedy our  shortcomings. Our economy's difficulties have been most severe  on the less fortunate classes. (Party analysis of the 1989 to  1994 National Development Plan, Mexico City, 10 July 1989).    Poverty has been deep-cutting in Mexico. Meso-American  cultures were far from opulent. The colonial system aggravated  the situation of large segments of the population. Political  independence had to be constructed within a framework of social  disparity. The construction of a liberal state, fully sovereign  and convinced of its progressive creed, was not sufficient to  alleviate secular penury. No Mexican historic stage conceals  lost paradises for which we should long or better times to which  we wish to return. (International Workshop on the Fight Against  Extreme Poverty, San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas, 3 August  1990).  <H5>  Regional development </H5>   There can be no regional development if decentralization and  policies of municipal strengthening do not take place along with  it. Up to a short time ago, regional development was conceived  as a nearly exclusive action of the public sector, with little  or no participation from the social and private sectors.  Regional policy appears to be a cause and effect of the  government sector, as if the private and social sectors and,  consequently, society in general do not play direct roles in any  developmental process. For this reason, it is intended that  such sectors can participate in the new regional development  policy. This does not mean, however, the Mexican state will  relinquish the leadership stipulated by the Constitution.    It is naive to try to attain a genuine regional development  only through the application of fiscal resources available to  federal and state governments and municipal administrations. We  will make the migration process stop to the extent that we  succeed in creating a new economic outlook in the country.  (Popular Consultation Forum on Decentralization for Regional  Development, Zacatecas, 22 February 1989).  <H5>  Modernization </H5>   Modernizing the country means adapting its structures to the  demands of the present to progress toward national goals.  Either we make the necessary changes in the process for our own  good or we will be run over by the changes that would occur  anyway, only without our participation. Modernizing the country  is the modernization of all. The state must modernize itself as  should corporations, labor and employers organizations,  professional associations, and academic institutions, women and  young people alike.    To stimulate modernization, the modern state desists from  activities in which its participation is not advisable either  because it inhibits the actions of particulars in fields  peculiar to them or diverts resources to nonessential  activities. In today's world, modernization implies  competitiveness. It is to be aware of and accept the challenges  of the international economy, to take advantage of the  conveniences it offers, and overcome the disadvantages. Under  present circumstances, autocracy means not taking advantage of  the many things a rich international coexistence can offer.  (Commentary to Jorge Trevino's fourth report, Monterrey, 15  March 1989).    Businessmen's success depends on the ability to organize  production and marketing, particularly on the willingness to  assume risks. For his own good, the modern businessman should  not base his success on preferential and discriminatory methods,  through conversations with the government. (Opening of the 2d  National Congress of Consultation Enterprises, Mexico City, 15  April 1989).    Economic modernization cannot be conceived without a  modernization of the public sector, a modernization that can  raise the public sector's ability to meet education, health, and  housing needs, as well as needs of other areas. Economic  modernization entails a timely and adequate supply of the goods  and services the remainder of society requires. (Meeting of the  National College of Economists, Toluca, 16 June 1989).  <H5>  Inflation </H5>   Constant price increases alter the economy and is a  formidable punishment to the lower income groups. We Mexicans  believe this situation is intolerable. Inflation distorts all  economic indicators and in turn makes the decisionmaking process  more difficult, encourages inadequate distribution of resources,  and at the same time concentrates functional and family national  income. In addition, rising inflation rates repress financial  awareness, which must be used to revitalize productive  investments, and cause it to be diverted to more speculative  activities. This trend blocks economic growth sooner or later.  (Meeting with the National Public Administration Institute,  A.C., Mexico City, 19 February 1990)  <H5>  Public Enterprise </H5>   In Mexico's revolutionary history, public enterprises have  been agents of social consensus and political stability. On  many occasions they have also been representatives of the  government's performance. Nevertheless, current times are  demanding we hone public enterprises with the tuning fork of  international competition, productivity, and efficiency.    Breaking up public enterprises is not the same as accepting  inefficient public service; neither should it be taken as the  state's withdrawal from its role as economic rector. Today's  world does not tolerate such simplistic dualisms. (Program  presentation on Modernizing State Enterprises, Mexico City, 14  March 1990)  <H5>  Training of Economists </H5>   (During past decades)...certain radical critics began by  noting that in the professional training of economists, the  defense of the status quo prevailed and the study of all  theories was avoided, deeming the attributes and theoretical  differences as academic ways of evading a compromise with the  most just causes.    The best part of that radical criticism revealed, with  intelligence, the social and political implications of our  activity. In several ways the criticism found a refuge in the  ideological dispute to conceal its ineptitude. The existing  concrete world began to evaporate; the economic reality became  more distant and inaccessible; the phenomena and operations of  the world economy and even of the national economy divorced  themselves from rigid theoretical postures. What, in the  beginning, was the defense of praiseworthy principles became a  Byzantine dissertation and ended up an ideological axiom. The  school gave way to revelation, which in turn gave way to dogma.    Simultaneously, in many countries other processes were being  implemented; meanwhile, our professionals faced all types of  confusions when entering the real world. Others, those who were  graduated in private or specialized institutions abroad, took  the most influential positions not only in the private sector  but the public sector as well.    In Mexico -- and I am sure the same goes for other countries  of the continent -- economists who graduated from public schools  have seen their ability to exert an influence or guide the most  important decisions affecting production, growth, development,  determining a country's social welfare and justice. (Forum on  the Training of Economists in Latin America, Mexico City, 26  March 1990).</p>

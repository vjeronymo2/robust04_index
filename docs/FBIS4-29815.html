			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta JP -- Minister of Justice Utoyo Usman said  the government is thinking about loosening screening procedures  to detect past communist links for those applying for jobs in  the administration and other strategic positions.    Utoyo said the government is currently reviewing the policy,  but stressed that certain sectors, such as the Armed Forces  (ABRI), will continue with the procedure.    The screening process, which is also used in the civil  service, has been widely criticized as a human rights violation.  This is because it virtually closes the doors on people  applying for administration jobs who were directly or even  distantly related to members of the now outlawed Indonesian  Communist Party (PKI).    Other professions in which people must be screened include  journalism and teaching. Candidates for the House of  Representatives must also undergo the screening.    The screening was often stretched to the point that even the  grand children of a former PKI or a son-in-law are screened out.    Two senior legal experts, Justice Bismar Siregar and Muladi,  again raised the point that the country should do away with the  screening. They said, in a seminar on Wednesday, that the  government should pay more attention to the many victims of the  policy.    Chief Justice Purwoto Gandasubrata, however, said that the  screening process should still be used in the interest of state  security and public order "so long as it does not violate  people's basic rights."</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Erik Bjorn Moller and Bent Winther: "Prime </F> Minister's Local Forces Favor SF"]    [Text] If an opportunity for close cooperation among the  Social Democratic Party (SDP), the Socialist People's Party  (SF), and the Radical Liberals arises it should be exploited,  according to a number of prominent local Social Democrats.    Several local Social Democrats are tired of their government  partners, the Center Democrats (CD) and the Christian People's  Party (KrF,) and think the SDP should focus on cooperating with  the SF.    This was shown by conversations BERLINGSKE TIDENDE has had  with eight Social Democratic county chairmen. The statements  were made after Radical Liberal Party leader Marianne Jelved  said that she is having "increasingly close" talks with the  Socialist People's Party.    Poul Oland, the SDP chairman for the capital district, said  the Social Democrats now need to be "free agents" with a sharper  profile.    "Personally I have absolutely nothing against the influence  the SF could exert. I would not vote against a constellation  with the SF and the Radicals," he says.    Elisa Pedersen, Funen County chairman and a member of the  executive committee, said it would be "lovely" if the SF was  included in a government. "The Socialist People's Party is  closer to us than the KrF and the CD. If we fight for something  it should not be for the CD. There is mounting dissatisfaction  here and there about showing the small government parties so  much consideration," she said.    North Jutland County chairman Bjarne Harder Larsen said the  same thing: "Many people think that the small center parties are  very difficult to drag around with us and that we are being  pulled around by the nose. And I can well understand that. It  would be better to do something with the Radicals and the SF."    At its Whitsun congress the SDP Youth League, DSU, will  formulate a strong recommendation for cooperation with the SF.    "We should drop the CD at the first opportunity we get. Let  us introduce a cooperation with the SF," said DSU chairman  Henrik Larsen. "The CD and the Christians have constantly been  extremely disloyal. It is painful to watch."    Ringkobing County chairman Bent Kruuse said the SF has many  votes that "could be put to better use." And Copenhagen County  chairman Grethe Blomberg "would have absolutely nothing against  a government with the SF and the Radicals."    The Storstrom, Bornholm, and Roskilde County chairmen want  to  wait and see, while the chairmen in West and North Zealand  recommended broader cooperation with the middle parties.</p>

			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / International Company News: Suchard invests in Turkish group JACOBS SUCHARD, the Swiss confectionery group owned by Philip Morris, has purchased a 50 per cent share in one of Turkey's largest edible oils companies. The acquisition will allow the Swiss group to market its products in Turkey and the six Turkic-speaking republics of former Soviet central Asia. The Swiss company paid an undisclosed sum for the stake in Marsa Margarine Sanayi, a subsidiary of Sabanci Holding, Turkey's second-largest industrial group. This is Jacobs Suchard's first move into Turkey, and underlines growing foreign interest in the Turkish foods sector. Marsa made sales of Dollars 171m in 1992, and is market leader in edible oils, margarine and bottled spring water. Jacobs Suchard by buying into an existing business, instead of green field investment, will obtain immediate market access, a distribution network, a list of local brands, and a base to introduce its own well-known brands such as Toblerone, Sucard and Milka. The company said it planned to invest in manufacturing in Turkey in 1994. In parallel moves, Unilever bought out the local Komili vegetable oils group last year, in the first example of a foreign buyer paying goodwill for a Turkish brand. Corn Products, the US owner of the Knorr brand name, bought out its local partner.</p>

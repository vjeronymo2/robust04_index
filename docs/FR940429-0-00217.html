The Secretary also believes that a student who enrolled at an institution but received a full 100 percent refund has not had sufficient educational experience at the institution to be considered anything other than a first-time student. The Secretary does not believe the issue of continuing education coursework poses a serious problem with the definition of a first-time student for the purposes of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  refund calculation. The Secretary recognizes that the definition of first-time student is different for certain purposes in the administration of the Title IV, HEA programs, and will explore the possibility of creating a single, consistent definition in the future.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Three commenters believed the proposed definition of ``the portion of the enrollment period for which the student was charged that remains'' is not consistent with the statutory definition of an academic year. The commenters asked the Secretary to include in the proposed definition an explanation of the term ``week'' and describe the appropriate handling of a student who attends only a portion of a week.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary does not believe consistency with the statutory definition of an academic year is relevant. The Secretary does not believe further explanation is necessary, and intends to entrust institutions with the responsibility for fairly and consistently handling uncertain situations such as a partial week of attendance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Period of Enrollment for Which the Student Has Been Charged. Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters suggested alternatives to the Secretary's definition of ``period of enrollment for which the student was charged.'' Three commenters suggested using only the length of the program, for institutions charging by the program, or the length of the term, for institutions charging by the term. One commenter suggested the Secretary require all institutions to use the academic year as the enrollment period. Another commenter suggested the Secretary require all institutions to use the lesser of a payment period, the program length, or the academic year. Three commenters believed the proposed definition does not address programs longer than an academic year. Several commenters believed the Secretary's proposed definition is unfair to institutions charging by the program, forcing them to use the cost of the entire program in the refund calculation, while only a portion of the financial aid awarded for the entire program can be counted when calculating the unpaid charges. Such a formula results in excessively high unpaid charges, which must be subtracted from the amount the institution could otherwise retain. The commenters believed this treatment is discriminatory against institutions that charge by the program and suggested the Secretary retain the concept of payment periods, both for assessing charges and considering aid disbursed, and limit those payment periods to one-third an academic year (as in a quarterly term system), or one-half an academic year (as in a semester term system). Two commenters believed the determination of the enrollment period for refund purposes should be left to the discretion of the institution. Two commenters asked that clock-hour institutions using standard terms be treated the same as credit-hour institutions using standard terms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary believes the proposed definition of ``period of enrollment for which the student was charged'' is adequate and applicable to the needs and circumstances of the various types of institutions participating in the Title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary wishes to clarify that the proposed definition establishes a minimum period of enrollment (to prohibit institutions from creating artificially short periods of enrollment simply for the purposes of reducing a student's unpaid charges or eligibility for a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  refund calculation) and does not impose a maximum limit to the period of enrollment. The Secretary recognizes that institutions charging by the program may have to pay  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> refunds to a greater number of students than institutions that charge by the term and may consistently find their students have high amounts of unpaid charges under the proposed refund calculation, resulting in a reduction in the amount the institution can retain for non  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  refund calculations. The Secretary would like to point out, however, that such a situation exists precisely because the institution charges the student for the entire cost of the program up-front. It is true the same student could attend an institution which charges by the term and would, under the proposed refund calculation, owe a smaller amount of unpaid charges. The term institution, however, does not contract with the student for any amount in excess of the costs of the term. The adverse affects of the Secretary's proposal, therefore, as claimed by some of the commenters, are the result of an institution's own decision to contract with the student for the costs of the entire program up-front, instead of contracting for the costs of a smaller period of study, such as an academic term; this is an institutional decision over which the Secretary has no control. The Secretary believes the discontinuation of the use of payment periods and the practice of attribution will greatly simplify the refund requirements, and that this benefit overrides the commenters' concerns. The Secretary believes it is necessary to define and limit the definition of enrollment period to ensure equitable refunds to Title IV, HEA program recipients. The Secretary wishes to clarify that, under the proposed definition, all clock hour institutions are treated the same, regardless of whether they use standard terms or not, because it has been the experience of the Secretary that these institutions all charge by the program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Kuchma acts on exchange rate: Ukraine leader's decree falls far short of complete liberalisation President Leonid Kuchma yesterday sent a mixed message about Ukraine's prospects for economic reform with a decree intended to unify the country's currency exchange rates. The decree sets out, without a specific timetable, to close the yawning gap between the official state-set exchange rate for the karbovanets and the open market rate. It proposes to do so through a complicated mathematical formula based on Ukraine's balance of payments, monetary emissions and inflation rate. But, as the first litmus test of the new administration's resolve to bring Ukraine's chaotic economy to heel, the decree falls far short of complete liberalisation of a single free-floating rate, advocated by the International Monetary Fund. It does not specify when the rates will be unified or even guarantee this will happen. At a press conference, Mr Kuchma's economic advisers, who said the decree was a compromise with advocates of a fixed rate, hoped that the karbovanets would be free-floating by the end of the year. They justified the gradualist approach by saying it would avoid an immediate inflation shock and give the government an opportunity to build up its hard currency reserves to support a free floating currency. Mr Kuchma's economic team intends to abandon its mathematical approach to the exchange rate in favour of market forces once a stabilisation fund, provided by the IMF, is available. The decree also reopens the inter-bank currency exchange, blamed and closed last November for stoking inflation, and lowers a punitive tax on hard currency revenues. However, Mr Kuchma, who still has time to set a reformist agenda in the honeymoon period following his election earlier this summer, may not completely satisfy an IMF mission now in Kiev, working on a reform programme to free a Dollars 700m initial loan. The loan would be the first step to releasing a Dollars 4bn package promised at last month's Naples economic summit. Currency liberalisation is seen as critical by western economists because the current restrictions are a principal contributor to market distortions and a massive capital flight. The karbovanets, an unstable currency which replaced the Russian rouble in 1992, yesterday traded for around 46,800 to the dollar on the street; the official rate, used by privileged importers and less fortunate exporters, was set this week at 20,500:1. With the currency losing its value daily, trying to unify the rates 'is a little like a dog chasing his tail', said a western economist, particularly now that Ukrainians will hold on to their hard currency if the official state rate is set to go up. The step, long-awaited in Kiev, does tip a hat to reform by reducing from 50 per cent to 30 per cent the share of hard currency revenues that companies must exchange at the lower official rate. This causes capital flight, estimated at Dollars 1bn per month, and creates a shadow economy.</p>

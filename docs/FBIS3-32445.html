			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Madrid, 7 Feb (AFP) -- In an interview with a  private television channel, "Subcommander Marcos," military  leader of the Zapatista rebels in Chiapas, Mexico, has stressed  that the Zapatist guerrillas have "forced the government to hold  a dialogue."    "As never before, now that the dialogue is going to be held,  the Zapatist Army needs civilian society," the subcommander said  in a lengthy interview to be aired tonight, part of which was  published in advance by the newspaper EL PAIS.    Marcos added, "The door to dialogue was finally opened at a  decisive moment -- the moment when the federal government  realized that the annihilation of our forces was, in the best of  all cases, highly unlikely, and, in reality, impossible."    He said that despite everything, the Zapatists oppose  holding  the dialogue in the jungle, "because if Camacho (Peace  Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis) enters the jungle and  something happens to him -- in other words, if they do something  to him -- they are going to say it is our fault." Marcos went  on to lament, "We cannot guarantee security here -- neither  Camacho's nor Don Samuel's (Chiapas Bishop Samuel Ruiz)."    Marcos also explained the majority of the guerrillas come  from the jungle and the mountains. "For the comrade peasants,  the EZLN [Zapatist National Liberation Army] was created as a  self-defense force against the white guards of the ranch owners."    According to Marcos, the insurgents view the armed struggle  "as part of a broader and more complex process that could have  profound consequences." He clarified that at no time "has there  been any support, not even blessing or approval by anyone from  the Catholic Church." He also denied there was foreign support:  "We do not think like the Maoists who believe that a peasant  army, coming from the mountains, will besiege the cities." He  added, "Our comrades only speak of autonomy, such as that of the  Basques or Catalonians (in Spain), which is a relative autonomy."    The guerrilla leader also said, "We believe that large-scale  military intervention against us is very unlikely." He  concluded: "The federal government is the one that is worried.  We think it is premature to speak of a U.S. intervention."</p>

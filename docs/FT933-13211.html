			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Oil tremors News of an agreement between the United Nations and Iraq over weapon monitoring sent oil prices falling to their lowest level since just before the Gulf war, casting a shadow over the UK oil sector. Many analysts perceived the agreement as making an accord on Iraqi oil sales easier, increasing the supply on the world market and thus weakening oil prices further. The day's casualties included BP, where the shares fell 6 1/2 to 285 1/2 p in trade of 6.4m. Shell Transport slipped 4 to 607p on 3m traded. However, the oils team at Strauss Turnbull said the decline in Shell offered investors a good buying opportunity, saying: 'It is more involved in the refining and marketing end than BP, which makes it a more defensive stock.' Lasmo shed 2 to 137 1/2 p. British Gas continued to recover and added 4 at 298p. News that SmithKline Beecham had applied to register a new herpes treatment helped the shares close higher and was largely responsible for a sharp fall in Wellcome. The latter has the lion's share of the Pounds 750m a year herpes market, with the leading drug Zovirax. SmithKline firmed a penny to 416p and Wellcome was 30 down at 604p. Union Discount moved forward 6 to 151p ahead of figures due next Monday. International trading group BAT Industries bucked the market trend and declined 6 to 431p, in trade of 4.4m, on a combination of profit-taking following last week's strong run, and nervous trading awaiting figures from US rival Philip Morris. Legal &amp; General jumped 14 to 510p as dealers appreciated the 27 per cent increase in new business that it announced yesterday. Prudential Corporation put on 6 at 348p in sympathy. Among composite insurers, Commercial Union was in demand, with Hoare Govett said to be positive. The shares gained 11 at 631p. Abbey National, a poor feature last week, recovered 7 to 409p. Credit Lyonnais Laing was said to have advised investors to switch into Abbey and out of National Westminster, whose shares nevertheless firmed 4 to 506p. Speculative talk about the long expected sale by TSB of Hill Samuel, its merchant banking arm, continued to circulate, sending the shares up 5 to 204p. Weekend press reports that Great Universal Stores was considering ways of distrib-uting a cash pile estimated at Pounds 1.5bn to shareholders saw the shares sustain last week's momentum. The 'A' stock rose 47 to 1957p, while the ordinary added 90 at 3490p. Last week the stock surged after the company announced its intention to enfranchise the non-voting shares. Hopes of a cut in German interest rates pushed the share price of Redland ahead 13 to 481p. Spring Ram benefited from the filip of bid speculation and moved up 4 to 54p. Confidence that its recent rights issue would prove a success began to turn the tables for United Newspapers after its bruising in the UK tabloid newspaper price wars. The stock improved 5 to 523p. BAA, the UK airports operator, appreciated 4 to 735p after it predicted traffic growth of around 4 per cent for this year. Container rental group Tiphook, which reported a loss last week, continued out of favour. Late afternoon bargain hunters helped the shares close off the bottom, finishing a net 21 down at 230p. The 10 'Recs' that went ex-dividend were greeted by a positive response from the market, with several notching up price rises on the day. Midlands finished 13 1/2 higher at 503p, while its neighbour East Midlands was 16 ahead at 457p. London rose 15 to 483p. A technicality born of a thin market was cited by one analyst as the reason behind an increase of nearly 15 per cent for Campari, the sporting clothes company. Campari, which has issued two profits warnings this year, moved up 20 to 133p. Reconstruction moves sent the price of UK Land into freefall, leaving it at 4p for a decline of 26p. Optimism ahead of Thursday's agm drove Regalian Properties up 2 to 17 1/2 p, while the rest of the sector held on to its recent firmness. International mining group RTZ forged ahead 14 to 683p after announcing the sale of its US oil and gas interests for Dollars 510m. Market watchers had expected the sale but the price obtained for the disposal was well above the best estimates of many analysts. Mr Emil Morfett at Smith New Court, which turned buyers of the stock earlier this month, said: 'RTZ is renowned for getting premium prices for its assets on disposals and this is another of those examples.' He expects further disposals soon.</p>

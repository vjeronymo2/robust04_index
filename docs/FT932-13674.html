			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Court boost for Yeltsin's hopes: President faces challenge threat as disquiet grows on reform RUSSIA'S Constitutional Court yesterday strengthened President Boris Yeltsin's hand by ruling he needed only a simple majority among those voting on the two most crucial questions in the referendum to be held on Sunday. The Congress of People's Deputies originally set rules under which he would need the support of half the 107m electorate. The split decision of the court was immediately welcomed by Mr Vyacheslav Volkov, the president's deputy chief of staff, who said that 'for us now this decision will be law'. The court found that the Congress exceeded its powers in decreeing that all four questions in the referendum required a majority of the entire electorate. By exempting the first two questions - on trust in Mr Yeltsin and approval of his economic programme - from these constraints, the court's ruling will allow Mr Yeltsin to claim a victory if he wins assent to one or both questions. The court also ruled that the turnout must exceed 50 per cent of the electorate, which opinion polls say is likely. The ruling clears the way for Mr Yeltsin to take immediate 'decisive action' by presenting a 'range of urgent measures' aimed at extending the base of private property, regulating the financial system and pursuing constitutional change. However, the court's confirmation of the right of the Congress to insist that 50 per cent of the electorate is needed to confirm early presidential and parliamentary elections means that a clear Yes for either of these remains unlikely - though the opinion polls show a solid majority of those intending to vote in favour of early re-elections of the parliament. However, Mr Yeltsin's position is still far from secure. A sign that Mr Yeltsin is no longer seen as the only flagbearer of reform came yesterday when Mr Sergei Shakhrai, his close aide and a deputy prime minister, said he considered himself a candidate for the presidency and hinted he might stand if Mr Yeltsin did badly in the referendum. Mr Shakhrai joins General Alexander Rutskoi, the vice-president, and Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, the prominent economist and former deputy Soviet prime minister, as declared candidates if Mr Yeltsin fails to win strong support. Mr Shakhrai's low-key comments may be taken as a sign of restlessness in the presidential camp, particularly as Mr Yeltsin has appeared uninspirational during the campaign. Though there is no overt disloyalty and a general recognition that he is the only figure who can mobilise support for reform, there is an increasing feeling that too many mistakes are being made.</p>

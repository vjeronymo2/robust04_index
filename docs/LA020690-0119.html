			<p><P> February 6, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STATE PLANS HEALTH REVIEW OF MALATHION SPRAY SITES  </P> <P> Countering charges that they have run roughshod over local concerns in their  campaign against the Mediterranean fruit fly, state officials said Monday that  they will set up a Southern California health advisory panel on the issue and  conduct air and water quality reviews in spray areas this month.  </P> <P> State health and agriculture officials disclosed the plans in morning-long  meetings with a delegation of Orange County politicians. The local group had  traveled to Sacramento to voice their anxieties about the anti-Medfly assault  and present a platform for changing the eradication process.  </P> <P> Critics of the state's handling of the Medfly battle praised the new plans as a  positive step in helping assuage public fears over the aerial spraying of  malathion, but said it may be too little, too late.  </P> <P> Orange County Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder, who led the delegation, said of  the health panel, "that would have been great if it were done before the fact,"  rather than after malathion had been sprayed over the homes of hundreds of  thousands of North County residents. State Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles), who  last week introduced two bills that would halt all aerial pesticide  applications pending a review of the spray's health effects, said the state's  new plan was a step in the right direction but does not go far enough.  </P> <P> "We need not only to monitor the water, but to stop the spraying and monitor  the health effects of malathion," Torres said.  </P> <P> Malathion opponents who have questioned the state's assurances about the  pesticide's safety have attacked the composition of its current scientific  advisory panel in Sacramento, made up entirely of insect specialists, with no  one from the public health or medical fields.  </P> <P> State officials said that they are confident that both the health advisory  panel and the air and water studies will confirm that the malathion policy  poses no health risks and, in the process, may win over critics of the effort  to eradicate the crop-attacking fly.  </P> <P> While the state met little resistance in its first sprayings in the Brea area  last year, the eradication's expansion into a 36-square-mile area around Garden  Grove and Westminster has sparked widespread protests and ongoing legal  challenges by some of the cities affected.  </P> <P> State officials have stood by the spraying policy, calling it a safe and  necessary means of protecting the state's $16-billion agriculture industry from  the current Medfly infestation.  </P> <P> But Rex Magee, associate director of the state Department of Food and  Agriculture, said after a sometimes-tense meeting with Orange County  politicians: "We've got to try and calm down the fears."  </P> <P> The new panel -- to be formed as early as this week -- would be made up of  county health officials from Los Angeles and Orange counties, as well as  academicians and medical professionals from around Southern California.  </P> <P> The panel would have the dual mission of advising the state on the health  implications of malathion spraying and of educating the public on its findings,  said James W. Stratton, medical epidemiologist with the state Department of  Health Services.  </P> <P> However, some at the state level were reluctant to pursue the idea, despite its  possible public relations benefit.  </P> <P> "A lot of people here just don't think there's a need for it," Rex R. Magee,  associate director of the state Department of Food and Agriculture, said in an  interview. "When this panel gets finished with its work, the conclusions about  malathion safety are the same and you still might not do anything to ease the  public's anxiety."  </P> <P> In another tactic aimed at quelling public opposition, state officials said  they planned to duplicate a study of malathion's effects on air and water  quality that was done in 1981 during Northern California's Medfly infestation.  </P> <P> Ronald J. Oshima, branch chief of the state's environmental monitoring and pest  management unit, said the state staff will place perhaps a dozen air quality  monitoring devices during a two-week period this month in the Southern  California spray zones. The units would be placed near hospitals, nursing  homes, schools and other areas where there might be people especially sensitive  to declines in air quality.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Orange County delegation, meeting with local Assembly members  and senators, put forth an 11-point plan for legislative reform that included  proposals for toughening the state's environmental review of the spraying  policy, and speeding and improving notification of the public about the  process. The plan got generally favorable response from more than a half-dozen  Orange County Assembly members and senators who met with the delegation.  </P> <P> Later Monday, attorneys for the cities of Huntington Beach and Garden Grove  took sworn depositions from state Medfly specialists. The depositions, to  continue today in Orange County, are part of the first legal challenge in  Southern California to the state's authority to spray malathion.  </P> <P> A Superior Court judge in Sacramento refused last month to halt the first  spraying in the Garden Grove area. But local attorneys, armed with new  testimony from this week's depositions, plan to return to court Feb. 15 -- the  date of the next spraying in the Garden Grove area -- to try again.  </P> <P> In four hours of questioning, the lawyers tried to show inconsistencies in the  state's method for determining spray areas and its review of the health effects  of malathion. Officials held firm in their testimony that the spraying poses no  adverse health effects.  </P> <P> In Orange County, meanwhile, a new organization called Orange County Citizens  Against Malathion Spraying announced that it will try to persuade the Orange  County Board of Supervisors not to extend the State of Emergency declaration  handed down by Gov. George Deukmejian. The month-old organization represents  several groups from 10 cities of Orange County that are concerned with the  effects of malathion spraying.  </P> <P> "This (spraying) situation is unjustified, intolerable and dangerous to our  health and property," said Bob Taylor, spokesman for the organization. "No  government official should have the right to blanket us and our families with  poisonous pesticides."  </P> <P> He said that if the governor refuses to stop the spraying, the organization  will consider actions that could include consumer boycotts of California  produce and mass demonstrations.  </P> <P> In addition, the city councils of Huntington Beach, Santa Ana and Garden Grove  took up the malathion issue in their meetings Monday night. A dozen local  residents attended the Santa Ana council meeting, some wielding signs that  read: "Stop Medfly Spraying." Councilman John Acosta had asked the city to  place an emergency item on the agenda to examine the Medfly issue.  </P> <P> "For all these years of spraying, nothing has been accomplished," Acosta said  in the meeting. "It seems that the only ones who benefit are the chemical  companies."  </P> <P> The county Board of Supervisors is scheduled to decide today whether to renew  the declaration of emergency. And tonight, a group of local residents are to  appear before the Fullerton City Council to push for passage of a resolution  asking the state to seek alternatives to aerial spraying.  </P> <P> Members of the Board of Supervisors on Monday expressed a wait-and-see attitude  on the state's new plans.  </P> <P> "I will listen to the presentations by the state officials, weigh them and make  a decision," said Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, noting that he has listened to  arguments from both sides of the issue.  </P> <P> An eight-square-mile area of North County that includes parts of Brea, La Habra  and Fullerton is scheduled for its fifth dose of malathion next Monday night.  Parts of nine cities near the areas where two Medflies were discovered in  Garden Grove and Westminster are scheduled for their second spraying Feb. 15.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Stephen C. Chavez, Lily Eng and George Frank contributed to  this report.  </P> <P> </P> <P> MEDFLY BATTLE IN ORANGE COUNTY  </P> <P> Nov. 17 -- A pregnant Mediterranean fruit fly is discovered in a guava tree in  Brea.  </P> <P> Nov. 30 -- State and county officials launch what is thought to be a  one-time-only malathion spraying over an eight-square-mile area of North  County, including parts of Brea, Fullerton and La Habra. The area is sprayed an  additional three times over ensuing weeks.  </P> <P> Jan. 10 -- Another pregnant Medfly is found, this time in Garden Grove. State  officials order a round of spraying for a 36-square-mile-area surrounding  Garden Grove and including Westminster and Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> Jan. 25 -- A Sacramento Superior Court judge refuses a last-minute appeal from  the cities of Huntington Beach, Garden Grove and Westminster to block malathion  spraying.  </P> <P> Jan. 26 -- The largest malathion application in the county's history begins in  the 36-square-mile area surrounding Garden Grove.  </P> <P> Feb. 5 -- An Orange County delegation of politicians travels to Sacramento to  protest the state's Medfly assault. State health and agricultural officials  disclose plans to set up a health advisory panel and conduct air and water  quality reviews in local spray areas.  </P> <P> Feb. 15 -- Attorneys for the Orange County cities are scheduled to go back to  court -- the same day as the next scheduled application in the 36-square-mile  area surrounding Garden Grove.  </P> <P> Compiled by Jim Carlton, Times Staff Writer  </P></p>

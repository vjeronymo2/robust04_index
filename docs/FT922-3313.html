			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Bush wary on Bosnia task force PRESIDENT George Bush, saying that 'we're not the world's policeman', yesterday sought to discourage speculation that the US was actively planning military intervention in Yugoslavia. In impromptu remarks before leaving for the Rio earth summit, Mr Bush said: 'We will do what we should do, but I'm not going into the fact of using US troops.' Expressing concern about the situation in Yugoslavia, he promised 'to safeguard human life' and to work closely with the UN. Yesterday the Washington Post had reported that the administration was now reluctantly considering options whereby American troops could be used to assist in humanitarian operations. There has been some groundswell of support in Congress for action to stop the slaughter. Senator Richard Lugar, the Indiana Republican, warned on Wednesday that the time had come to 'draw the line' with respect to Serbia's territorial ambitions, if necessary through co-ordinated military action by the UN and/or Nato.</p>

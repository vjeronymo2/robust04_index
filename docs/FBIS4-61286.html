			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 4 TASS -- Ukraine has removed to Russia  180 strategic nuclear missiles as of today, Igor Sergeyev,  commander of the Russian strategic missile forces, said.    In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Wednesday, Sergeyev said  that the missiles will be scrapped at Russian plants as  envisaged by the agreements signed by Russia, Ukraine and the  United States and START-1 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty.    Sergeyev recalled that under the Lisbon Protocol,  Byelorussia  [Belarus], Kazakhstan and Ukraine are also parties to the treaty  which has been ratified by the U.S., Russia, Byelorussia and  Kazakhstan.    He stressed that Russia has already scrapped over 350  missiles and about 300 missile launchers. He added, however,  that the implementation of the treaty depends not only on  Russia, but also other ex-Soviet republics which posses nuclear  weapons.    Russia has signed an agreement with Byelorussia to transfer  a  group of strategic missile troops in Byelorussia under Russia's  control. Russia is also withdrawing strategic missile units  from that republic.    A similar agreement was signed with Kazakhstan in March  1994.  Both sides are now working on an agreement on the elimination of  missile facilities.</p>

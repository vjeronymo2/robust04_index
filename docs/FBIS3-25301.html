A police spokesman, Colonel  Raymond Dowd, said the police met a delegation under the  chairmanship of the Western Cape ANC Chairman Dr. Allan Boesak  this afternoon to discuss the incident. Col. Dowd said that the  actions of the Internal Stabiity Unit should not be condemned  before the outcome of the investigation was known.    Earlier Law and Order Minister Hernus Kriel called in the  help of the UN Observer Mission in South Africa in an attempt to  protect the credibility of the police. Mr. Kriel said that he  had asked the mission to make UN observers available on a  24-hour basis, to accompany the police on any law enforcement  duties involving entering the premises of any political party or  organization.    The ANC has termed the raid on its Cape Town offices brutal  and has called for the resignation of Mr. Kriel. The ANC  demanded answers as to why the raid had taken place and what  disciplinary steps would be taken against policemen responsible  for alleged insults.</p>

			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Inchcape sells motor rental businesses Inchcape, the international motors, services and marketing group, has sold its remaining car and van rental businesses to a management buy-out for Pounds 29.75m. The sale of Kenning Car and Van Rental (KCVR) and United Rental Group had been expected, and represents the final phase of streamlining following the acquisitions of TKM and Hogg Group. The buy-out was backed by venture capital group 3i, which has put together a Pounds 100m financing package to cover the purchase price and an additional off balance sheet debt of Pounds 70m related to the vehicle fleets. Mr Chris Rowlands, director of 3i's Birmingham office, said the two companies had made a total operating profit of about Pounds 4.5m last year. 3i has put together Pounds 17m of equity funding, while Barclays arranged Pounds 15.5m of debt. The management will own about 40 per cent of the company's shares. KCVR was purchased by Inchcape as part of the Pounds 383m acquisition of TKM in March 1992, while United was part of Hogg Group, which was bought in June. Their combined fleets, including vehicles operated by franchisees, amount to 25,000 vehicles and the two companies operate through more than 200 outlets. Mr Kevin Betts, former finance director at Central TV, is to be chairman, and David Hardman will be chief executive. 3i said there had been competition for the deal from other vehicle rental companies and also venture capital groups.</p>

Roengchai Marakanon,  deputy governor of the Bank of Thailand, said on Thursday night  that the economy was showing signs of strong and rapid revival.  To avoid overheating, the central bank has therefore decided to  further control excess liquidity so that the projected 21  percent credit expansion can be achieved. The strong growth is  partly attributable to the export growth of last year and this  year, which is likely to surpass all expectations, Mr. Roengchai  said.    Last month's annual export value increased by 15.6 percent,  while the target was set at 14.6 percent. This indicates quite  definitely that the economy will grow by not less than 8 percent  this year, he said.    Mr. Roengchai added that the financial system will be tight  in the short term, depending on the spending of the public  during certain periods. In these cases the central bank will  accommodate through the extension of short-term loans. If, on  the other hand, there is excess liquidity, the Bank of Thailand  will adopt absorption measures, some of which may include bond  issues by government enterprises such as the Bank for  Agriculture and Cooperatives.    In the long rung, however, Mr. Roengchai said he believes  that the liquidity excess will be lower than last year but not  to the level of tight money thanks to the remaining capital  inflows, particularly in non-resident baht accounts and in the  Stock Exchange of Thailand.    The outflow experienced during last month did not even reach  5 percent of the total capital inflow of last year which stood  at 280 billion baht he said.    Although deposits have risen 17 percent to 18 percent while  credits have expanded more than 21 percent, the financial market  will not be tightened. This is because commercial banks can  mobilize foreign funds from abroad, he explained. Consequently,  the central bank must follow the situation closely to ensure  adequate liquidity and to avoid overheating resulting from an  excess in credit expansion (more than 21 percent) and high  inflation (higher than 4 percent).    It is vital to control inflation at the projected level as  it  plays a very important role in fostering the competitiveness of  Thai exports. Malaysia, for example, has inflation of as low as  3 percent, Mr. Roengchai said.</p>

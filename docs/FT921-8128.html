			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market report Nickel prices were in retreat on the LME yesterday in a reaction to Monday's advance. Producer-based selling put pressure on the market: recent fund buying was absent. Stocks rose 540 tonnes to 19,284, their highest since August 1984. Copper edged higher in line with New York, aided by underlying physical interest. This helped the three-month price to move above resistance at Dollars 2,230 a tonne. New York sugar prices were well ahead at midday. Analysts cited commission house and fund short covering ahead of March's expiration. The majority of speculative players have been short for the past few weeks. London cocoa prices advanced Pounds 18 a tonne in early trading on news of rioting in the Ivory Coast capital Abidjan. But prices eased in the afternoon to close unchanged. On the London bullion market silver was in retreat following a sharp early fall on Comex. Dealers said silver could move to 400 cents again if it broached support at 405 cents a troy ounce. London's freight futures continued to retreat, although closing off earlier lows. A further sharp fall in the Baltic Freight Index by 17 points to 1,282 reflected the vessel surplus in nearly all cash market sectors and size classes, dealers said. Compiled from Reuters</p>

			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Sponsors steer clear of Soviet coup festivities ATTEMPTS to win private-sector backing for celebrations in Moscow to mark the defeat of the Soviet coup a year ago have ended in chaos. The organising committee, taking into account the dire state of Russia's finances, sought sponsorship for the festivities from the many private businesses established since the Soviet grip on the economy was loosened. The committee asked a private company to take on the task of finding sponsorship for the estimated Rbs70m-90m cost of the 'Vivat Rossiya' (Long live Russia) celebrations. But the company failed to deliver, blaming the lack of a role for a principal sponsor and the absence of an interest-free loan from the state. Mr Grigory Andreyev, a member of the organising committee, said an afternoon of band music and entertainment scheduled for Red Square on Saturday was one of the casualties. He said the celebrations were important because 'we still hope that what started in August will prevail . . . that democracy and freedom will prevail'. While the state as usual is expected to stump up some money at the last minute, recriminations are rife over who is responsible for the debacle. The director of one Moscow advertising agency, who said he stood on the barricades last year, had advised his clients against providing finance because there was no principal sponsor slot. Still to go ahead are a voluntary gathering tonight of people who 'defended' President Boris Yeltsin's 'White House' against Soviet army tanks, as well as a rally attended by Russian leaders tomorrow. There will also be a service tomorrow in memory of the three young people who died when tanks rumbled through Moscow, followed by brass-band and rock concerts on Saturday. More traditional methods have been used in St Petersburg, Russia's second largest city. The celebrations are to be financed by a Rbs800,000 grant from the city budget, although the prospect of 'freedom marches' organised by the city authorities is reminiscent of old-style birthday celebrations for the Communist Youth League. Some inhabitants were also bemused by plans to award 600 medals to defenders of freedom in the city when tanks came nowhere near it. Mayor Anatoly Sobchak will have returned from a holiday in Barcelona in time to preside over the proceedings, although his city's economic situation is as dire as Moscow's. However, the razzmatazz may fall rather flat. Public indifference has long replaced the euphoria which followed the coup's collapse on August 21, suggesting that there is little demand for celebrations. A year after the coup, Page 3</p>

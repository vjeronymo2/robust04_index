			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Equity Markets: Investors back in a wary phase - New York Since midsummer, interest rate jitters have waxed and waned on Wall Street with the regularity of a lunar cycle. Over a two-week period, concern over monetary policy would build up and dominate sentiment. Over the following fortnight, the fears and uncertainty would dissipate. The pattern has repeated itself several times. This week investors are back in a wary phase. Most of the bellwether companies have already posted their third-quarter results, taking away a potent diversion. Meanwhile, the recent economic data indicate the economy is accelerating, rattling bonds. There was news that builders had broken ground on new residential housing at the fastest pace since last December, before the harsh winter commenced and the Fed began tightening credit conditions. The spurt of construction suggested that the Federal Reserve will have to lift rates again soon to cool the economy. A sixth boost in short-term rates is not a welcome prospect for stocks. The reporting season thus far has produced many more pleasant surprises than disappointments, but investors are wondering how long earnings can continue to grow, with borrowing becoming increasingly expensive. The mood swing on Wall Street since last Monday morning is quite evident, even though stocks had been expected to meet technical resistance in making much headway during the week. With most of the results out of the way the focus has shifted again to the bond market, and the picture there is not very pretty for shareholders. On Friday, the benchmark 30-year bond yield broke through 8.00 per cent, an important marker, before receding a little. It was a red flag for equity investors who fear the higher returns will divert investment from stocks. Though such buying might allow bonds to hold steady, further declines are not out of the question ahead of Friday's fresh estimate of third-quarter GDP. Many economists are expecting an upward revision. The interplay between bonds and stocks is complicated by renewed weakness in the dollar. Equity investors are looking closely at the dollar's movements against the D-Mark and yen. As the US currency goes, bonds and stocks will probably follow. With interest rates back on centre stage, late-comers reporting quarterly results will be a sideshow. Ford, the last of the Big Three to release, has piqued some curiosity. With Chyrsler doing better than expected and General Motors a big disappointment, investors are eager to see how the number two car maker performed in the quarter. Wall Street is also anxious to learn how Kodak fared. A cost-cutting programme implemented earlier this month suggests the company is struggling to meet its operating targets.</p>

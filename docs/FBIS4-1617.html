			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By special correspondent Ching Chi (5427 2765): "Fifty </F> Percent of People Favor Using Demonstrations When Necessary"]    [Text] With the further development of reform and opening  up in China in the past year, citizens are enjoying more and  more political rights. People also have new ideas of how to  participate in politics, such as holding assemblies and  demonstrations. A survey shows that when asked about their  attitude toward holding demonstrations, more than half of the  interviewees said that they should be held if necessary. Thirty  percent of the interviewees said that it is better not to adopt  such means. Nearly 8 percent of the interviewees said under no  circumstances should people take to the streets and hold  demonstrations.    However, results of the survey show that when common Chinese  people wanted to criticize the government for certain policies  or practices, their first option was to "report their views to  party and government departments concerned," and holding  assemblies or demonstrations was their last option.    This research, directed by Zhang Mingshu, associate research  fellow of politics of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, is  one of a series of surveys on national conditions organized  since 1988 by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. More than  2,000 people living in 13 large, medium-sized, and small cities  were interviewed. The method of random sampling was used. Major  results of the research are published in the new book entitled  "`Political People' in China."    Zhang Mingshu made a further explanation about the survey,  saying that some people regarded politics as a field in which  morals, sincerity, and conscience were totally lost, but most  Chinese citizens held that politics were not something bad.  During the survey, the latter expressed that the government was  an organ for the administration of public affairs of the people  and they hoped that the government could do more for them.    Therefore, in their participation in politics, Chinese  citizens always trusted and depended more on the governments and  organizations concerned and showed relatively close cooperation  with the ruling party and the government in the course of  participation. Zhang Mingshu said that these features in  selecting a means for the participation in politics of Chinese  citizens were great "political resources" of the government.    When they wanted to express their views on government  policies and behaviors, nearly 26 percent of the interviewees  optioned to report their views to government departments  concerned, 15 percent of them favored reporting their views to  the leadership of the respective units, only 1.3 favored holding  demonstrations, and only 1.8 percent favored holding rallies.  Nevertheless, more than half of the interviewees held that  holding rallies and demonstrations can be a means to be adopted  when necessary.    Since 1954, all constitutions of China state that holding  demonstrations is one of the basic political rights of the  citizens. However, in 37 years from 1949 to 1986, basically no  large-scale demonstration was held by citizens to criticize  government policies in China.    After the survey, Zhang Mingshu put forward suggestions  concerning policies. To the portion of citizens with a  relatively high political quality, such as intellectuals,  personalities of the democratic parties, young students, and so  on, it is necessary to adopt flexible methods, to provide them  with more opportunities to participate in politics, and to  eliminate intermediate obstacles so that their views and  suggestions can reach the ruling party and government through  normal channels, the situation at the lower levels can be made  known to the higher levels, and the democratic channels are  unimpeded.</p>

			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / International Company News: Accor sees first-half tumble into the red Accor, the French hotels and travel service group, said yesterday that it would report a loss for the first half of the year, compared with a net profit of FFr109m (Dollars 20.60m) in the same period in 1993. The company declined to comment on the size of the loss ahead of an official announcement next week. It said, however, the deficit reflected the lack of exceptional gains on the disposal of assets which have boosted profits in previous years. Accor said the first-half performance would be affected by the seasonal nature of the hotels business. However, the economic recovery in some of its principal European markets was expected to have a positive impact in the second half of the year. Industry analysts said they were not surprised by the prospect of the loss. 'Since it became apparent that there would be no exceptional gains, the announcement is not a shock,' said Mr Herve Guez, an analyst at Smith New Court. Another hotels analyst said a poor operating result would fuel concerns about the group's recovery prospects. The forecast loss is the latest step in a results decline at the hotels group which has seen profits fall from FFr802m in 1992. The company has been hit by the impact of recession in its principal markets and has little exposure to the UK, where recovery has come earlier than on the continent. Profits have also been hit by a heavy debt burden which totalled about FFr13.3bn at the end of last year, excluding the debts of Motel 6, the US chain in which Accor has a controlling 39.5 per cent stake. The high level of debts, partly due to the company's 1991 acquisition of Wagons-Lits of Belgium, have prompted a programme of asset disposals.</p>

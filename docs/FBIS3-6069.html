			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 12 March Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA] on 11 March  revealed that Sadayuki Hayashi, who was named deputy  vice-minister of foreign affairs the same day, would visit the  United States next week and meet with Bowman Cutter, deputy  assistant to the President (for economic policy) who is the U.S.  official in charge of the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks.  The purpose is to look for clues on reopening the framework  talks.    The United States says it will "decide on reopening the  talks  after studying the substance of the market liberalization  measures to be finalized by the Japanese Government by the end  of March," (according to Secretary of State Christopher), but  there are unclear points, such as which area of measures the  United States is most interested in. The MOFA is hoping to find  out the accurate intentions of the U.S. Government and use this  information in helping restore the relations between the  countries.    In meetings with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and  Foreign  Minister Tsutomu Hata, Secretary Christopher urged Japan to come  up with import promotion measures which will be effective,  saying, "Ambiguous steps are not good." Regarding market  liberalization plans, the Japanese Government has offered to  finalize them in two steps -- doing part of them by the end of  March, and the rest of them by the end of June. Christopher's  remark is believed to have been a warning to Japan against using  this "two-step formula" as an excuse for delays, and for not  coming up with any effective measures in March.    Resuming and making progress in the framework talks can be a  justification for stopping the imposition of the Super 301  provision (definition of unfair trade practices and nations  engaged in such practices, and sanctions against them). Thus,  MOFA wants to put emphasis on the work of finding out the true  intentions of the United States with respect to resumption of  the talks.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The government has not implemented a shock  [preceding word in English] economic policy because pensions are  indexed by constitutional mandate and because it was impossible  to apply the process of reducing public expenditures due to the  failure of privatizations. This is why the anti-inflationary  measures have followed a "gradualist" course, Economy Minister  Ignacio Posadas stressed in remarks to the Argentine newspaper  AMBITO FINANCIERO.    Referring to the Argentine convertibility plan, the minister  said: "The transformation Argentina has experienced has impact,  is revolutionary." And his opinion is that convertibility has  "a symbolic value, but in my opinion it does not compare with  structural reforms that are more substantial and long lasting."    Posadas admitted: "There was a time when our government  seriously debated the possibility of implementing something  similar, but it did not because the indexation of pensions  imposed by the Constitution would have implied that a shock  [preceding word in English] policy would have been followed by  an enormous increase in social security expenditure."    He also added: "It was not possible to synchronize the  process with the generation of fiscal resources from  privatizations; this is a minority government. This was the  great difference (with Argentina) that made us adopt a  gradualist anti-inflationary strategy."    Referring to "currency over-evaluation," the minister said  "this is a topic being discussed throughout Latin America," and  that the so-called "over-evaluation" is nothing less than the  level of competition of national enterprises when compared with  foreign enterprises. "It would be dangerous to generalize  because it implies not acknowledging the fact that some  enterprises have had problems and others have made progress," he  said.    Posadas indicated that it is not fair to attribute  competition problems to exchange rate problems "because there  are a series of factors in play: salary agreements within the  private sector that have not come up to expectations; certain  markets that receive our exports have suffered a recessionary  period during the past few years; and some of our competitors,  such as Southeast Asia, have had much lower costs than our own."    He also cited the argument of the inflow of capital that has  kept the dollar at a low price in our market and has led the  Central Bank to intervene in order to sustain the dollar to  prevent a greater loss of competition by enterprises. "In any  case, what can be questioned is whether every thing is being  done, but what cannot be denied is that in this respect an  active policy has been followed," the minister said. The  minister rejected devaluation to improve competition because it  would only be "a short-term improvement that would lead to  greater inflation."    Posadas also evaluated the current government's  accomplishments, saying: "We can feel satisfied if we take into  account this government's starting point, but if we measure our  task with all that we wanted to do and with what the country  needs, then we have to acknowledge that we have not achieved all  that we would have liked to."</p>

			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Lonrho rights issue expected to fail LONRHO'S rights issue, which closes today, is expected to fail after many of its institutional shareholders yesterday said they would not be taking up their rights. The share issue was designed to flop to enable Mr Dieter Bock, a German financier who is underwriting half the new shares, to become the group's biggest shareholder. Lonrho's shares yesterday fell 1p to 71p compared with the rights issue price of 85p. Some of the group's big shareholders believe Mr Bock will shortly join the board as joint chief executive with Mr Tiny Rowland. One institutional shareholder said: 'We have been told by Lonrho that Mr Rowland may retire quite soon in favour of Mr Bock.' Several others said they had received a clear message from Lonrho that Mr Bock had been chosen as Mr Rowland's successor and that the succession would occur relatively quickly. Shareholders have been deeply concerned in the past about the unresolved question of who would succeed 75-year-old Mr Rowland. Charterhouse, Lonrho's financial adviser, said: 'Mr Rowland is unlikely to have sold his shares to someone he disagrees with or whom he is unhappy with as a large and influential shareholder.' Mr Bock has said he will consider whether to join the board several weeks after the rights issue closes. If Lonrho's shareholders do not take up their rights, Mr Bock will end up with 18.8 per cent of the enlarged group. Mr Bock has already bought almost half of Mr Rowland's stake at 115p a share  -a substantial premium to Lonrho's current share price - and has the option to buy the other half after three years. This would take Mr Bock's total stake to 24.8 per cent. To raise the money to buy his Lonrho stake, Mr Bock has made a number of property disposals. He is also considering offers for 10 to 20 per cent of his shareholding in Advanta, a Dutch-based company with extensive property and construction interests in Germany. Mr Bock is underwriting the deal through his privately owned company, Laerstate, registered in the Netherlands.</p>

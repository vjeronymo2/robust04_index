			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] An Israeli Arab delegation is to travel in the  coming days to Syria to extend condolences to President Hafiz  al-Asad on the death of his son last month. The delegation will  be headed by Knesset Member [MK] 'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah.  Darawshah says Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa personally  intervened to make the historic visit possible.    Here in Israel, a senior official in the Prime Minister's  Office called the news of the Syrian decision encouraging.  David Ze'ev reports:    On Tuesday [15 February], Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said  a  positive reply to MK Darawshah's request would mark some kind of  change in the Syrian attitude toward Israel. At the Prime  Minister's Office last night, a senior source reacted by saying  the fact that President al-Asad has given the Israeli Arab  delegation permission to make the trip contains in it something  encouraging. The source went on to say that there could be a  connection between the positive Syrian reply and the recent  statements coming out of Israel that Damascus is not showing any  openness toward Israel. Both Prime Minister Rabin and Foreign  Minister Shim'on Peres have spoken out strongly on the issue  during the past week.    [Begin recording] [Darawshah] As I know, it's the first  time that the Syrian Government is allowing any Israeli Arab  citizen to enter Syria.    [Ze'ev] When will you be going?    [Darawshah] I suppose in the coming few days. We got the  permission through the Egyptian ambassador in Israel, in which  he informed me that the Syrians are welcoming the coming of the  delegation.    [Ze'ev] Did the Egyptians act as mediators?    [Darawshah] They made their good efforts to convey our  message to Mr. President Hafiz al-Asad, to pass the message, and  also to mediate as brothers -- especially the foreign minister,  Mr. 'Amr Musa, who intervened in this issue.    [Ze'ev] Will you take the opportunity to promote  Syrian-Israeli peace efforts or the release of missing Israeli  servicemen, any issue like that?    [Darawshah] We are going to pay our condolences as a human  issue, and we do not think that we are going for political  reasons. Mr. Rabin did not ask me to pass any messages, and he  knows very well that I'm going on a human basis. [end recording]    MK Darawshah says his delegation will number 30 or 31  people:  mayors, poets, writers, religious and other leading  personalities among the Arab population in Israel.    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0505 GMT on 18 February  adds that upon learning from the Egyptian ambassador that he had  been granted permission to visit Syria, MK Darawshah "contacted  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin in his capacity as defense minister  and asked his permission. The prime minister immediately gave  his consent. Moreover, Rabin emphasized he would take all the  necessary steps to facilitate the visit. The prime minister  informed Darawshah that he has authorized Eytan Haber, the  director of his bureau, to be in constant contact with Darawshah  in order to pave the way for the departure of the delegation."]</p>

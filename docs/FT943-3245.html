			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Fresh law on animal transport planned Mr William Waldegrave, agriculture minister, yesterday outlined plans for tough measures to improve the treatment of live animals on long journeys in the hope of defusing the row between ferry companies and farmers over the lucrative export trade. But ferry companies - several of which have already implemented a ban on transporting live animals after a public outcry - appeared unimpressed, saying that they would maintain their bans. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals criticised the new code, because it is applicable only in the UK and does not cover further travel in the European Union. It questioned the ability of the UK authorities to enforce the code and expressed disappointment that it did not contain a maximum journey time of eight hours for animals bound for slaughter. Stena Sealink said its ban on carrying live animals would stay until a code was drawn up that was acceptable to the RSPCA. Peninsular and Oriental, which carries the bulk of live animal exports, said it was still committed to banning the traffic from October 1. Farmers hope that the ferry companies will rethink their objections to the new code during the consultation period until October 18. Mr Waldegrave urged ferry companies to act as if the code was already in place. He said: 'This is an important initiative. In the absence of agreed and enforceable EU measures, I shall be amending the law to give teeth to the enforcement of best practice already required by our national controls.' The code would introduce a new criminal offence for hauliers falsifying journey plans. The measures would compel hauliers to fill in a standard journey plan for all trips over 15 hours. Plans for departure, arrival times and staging posts would have to be approved by a government vet. Mr Waldegrave said that he recognised the need to toughen legislation at a European level, but the measures in the code would give the government far greater power to stop malpractice in Britain. Farmers groups have warned that they stand to lose up to Pounds 200m a year if the ferry companies' bans are maintained.</p>

			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Wellcome fall seen as no threat to offer: Optimism contrasts with retribution from advisers to forthcoming and cancelled share issues ADVISERS to Wellcome Trust, the charity planning to sell a large tranche of its stake in the drugs group Wellcome, yesterday denied there was any threat to the Pounds 3bn issue. Mr Philip Bradley, a director of Robert Fleming, the London merchant bank co-ordinating the global offer, said there was nothing unusual about the sharp fall in Wellcome's share price since the offer was announced last March. Last week's drop in the Wellcome share price to 887p is 21 per cent below the level prevailing when Wellcome Trust announced the sale of part of its 73.5 per cent holding. Mr John Robb, chief executive, leaves for Tokyo tomorrow to market the issue worldwide. Mr Bradley said Wellcome's share price was being driven down by institutional investors. It was in the interests of institutional shareholders to see a lower price in the run-up to the offer, he said. He denied some reports that the Trust was considering pulling the issue. 'It would require the most extraordinary circumstance or indeed an act of God for us to consider pulling an issue before the three-week book building process commencing on July 6 has even begun,' he said. 'The Trust is not required to raise any particular level of funds,' Mr Bradley insisted. 'When we announced the provisional size of the offer last Thursday we could afford to use a considerable degree of conser-vatism.' The company's shares are likely to remain volatile before the offer closes on July 24. The stock is regarded as unusually illiquid, with about 70 per cent of the traded shares being held by only 30 institutions. Additional volatility is added by Wellcome's second best-selling drug, Retrovir, the anti-HIV medicine. Although it represents only 11 per cent of the group's turnover, any story about a new HIV treatment has a disproportionate effect on the share price.</p>

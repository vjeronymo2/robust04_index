			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Williams Holdings If Williams Holdings did not so obviously relish its maverick status, it might have despaired at the 4 per cent share price fall in reaction to yesterday's 42 per cent increase in pre-tax profits. Its operations, not least Yale &amp; Valor, generated Pounds 40m cash and showed resilience in recession. The figures will doubtless appear even more impressive as more companies report. It is nevertheless hard to quibble with the market's response. It is not convinced that Williams has real momentum after the failed bid for Racal. In addition, the group compounded worries about its attitude to accounting, notably by the Pounds 7m extraordinary write-down of its 10 per cent Racal stake. To protect profits thus is at odds with the policy suggested by the Accounting Standards Board. It also raises questions about what will happen if and when the stake is eventually sold. Any profit will have to be taken above the line or Williams will risk another ticking off. Meanwhile, there is an annual Pounds 7m carrying cost. Equally damaging was the normally laudable decision to limit the dividend increase in order to re-build cover. Given that earnings will probably fall this year, the policy suggests a maintained pay-out.</p>

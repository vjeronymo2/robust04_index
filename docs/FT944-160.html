			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / West tells Russia of concern over Chechnya Germany, speaking as president of the European Union, told Russia yesterday of the EU's strong concern over the bloodshed in Chechnya, and questioned Moscow about what further moves it was planning. 'There was an expression of concern about civilian casualties, and a request for information,' said a government official in Bonn, referring to yesterday's call on the Russian Foreign Ministry by Mr Otto von der Gablentz, Germany's ambassador to Moscow. Mr Thomas Pickering, the US ambassador in Moscow, also visited the Russian ministry and discussed both Chechnya and Russian-American relations. Mr Igor Ivanov, a deputy foreign minister, briefed him on Russia's intentions in Chechnya. The diplomatic initiative by Germany - which hands over the EU presidency to France tomorrow - came at the end of a week in which western comment on Chechnya has hardened, albeit without threatening Russia-west relations. In both the US and western Europe, officials have expressed dismay over the fact that Russian forces are killing civilians and have broken promises to stop bombing soft targets. In Washington, the State Department for the first time directly criticised Russian tactics in Chechnya and urged an end to attacks on civilians. It said it was 'deeply disturbed' by reports of the bombing of an orphanage. This marks a change of emphasis from the west's initial comments on the crisis, which held out the hope of a peaceful settlement and stressed that the crisis was a domestic one. However, most western commentary is still stopping short of any assertion that Chechnya will affect the overall relationship between Russia and the west. At the UK Foreign Office, diplomats said it was too early to say what effect the conflict would have on broader ties. Like most of his western counterparts, Mr Klaus Kinkel, Germany's foreign minister, stresses that the conflict between Moscow and Grozny is an internal affair. However Mr Kinkel faces mounting criticism from the opposition Social Democrats, and the Free Democrats, the junior coalition partner. There are also senior members of the ruling Christian Democratic party who want Bonn to take a far more critical stance towards President Boris Yeltsin. This week Mr Kinkel held an hour-long telephone conversation with Mr Andrei Kozyrev, his Russian counterpart. But officials said Mr Kozyrev gave no commitments on a political solution. German and other western officials have expressed concern over the effect of the crisis on Turkey, where sympathy for the Chechens - and fears of a western 'sell-out' to Moscow - run high. In a year-end interview with news agencies, President Bill Clinton took a softer line, describing the conflict as 'an internal Russian political problem'. Moscow, he said, was facing 'a secessionist movement and they are dealing with it as best they can'. In spite of its generally tougher tone, the State Department stopped well short of linking the Chechen conflict to the broader US-Russian relationship. This was markedly strained at this month's European security summit, although since then the US has tried to limit the damage. But domestic criticism that the administration is giving too much of a green light to Russian action in Chechnya is mounting. Mr Zbigniew Brzezinski, the former national security adviser, has urged a rapid expansion of Nato regardless of Russian sensibilities. Also Mr Lee Hamilton, outgoing chairman of the House foreign affairs committee, disagreed with the US description of the assault on Chechnya as 'an internal matter'.</p>

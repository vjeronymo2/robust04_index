			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Income Distribution): Middle-bracket households win - An analysis by The Institute of Fiscal Studies FOR THE second successive year, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, has produced a Budget whose distributional consequences are markedly different from most Conservative Budgets of the 1980s. Whereas the Lawson Budgets of 1986, 1987 and 1988 produced cuts in income tax rates which disproportionately rewarded the richest taxpayers, Mr Lamont seems to have gone out of his way to show concern for poorer taxpayers, and, in the case of the Income Support changes, for those too poor to pay any tax at all. However, as our distributional analysis shows, the picture is a little more complicated than first impressions might suggest. The first chart shows the effect of the Budget measures on the disposable incomes of households of different types. The comparison is with a Budget which simply maintained the real value of income tax allowances and excise duties and left tax rates unchanged. This is the usual basis on which governments conduct their financial planning. The first clear result is that the vast majority of households have gained from this year's Budget measures. About four in five households are net gainers from the changes, and the average gain for the population as a whole is some Pounds 80 per year (compared simply with an indexed Budget). However, it also emerges from our analysis that about one in six households is worse off as a result of the changes. In particular, losses are most likely to occur among non-working couples and among single people without a job. A combination of factors produces losses for these groups. In the first place, the income tax cut is of no present value to those who are not paying tax, and so the non-working population below pension age largely missed out in this year's Budget. Second, and for the second year running, the married couple's tax allowance was frozen and so during the coming year its real value will again be eroded by inflation. This change cost all married couples paying tax at the basic rate about Pounds 20 per year. Third, some excise duties, principally those on tobacco, leaded petrol and on motor vehicles, were raised by more than the rate of inflation. Even the poorest households pay excise duties, and so when these are raised by more than inflation, they again lose out. For all of these reasons some of the poorer families of working age found themselves worse off as a result of yesterday's announcements. For the retired population the picture is generally much brighter. Retired taxpayers will gain from the reduced rate of income tax, while married pensioners, unlike their working age counterparts, did not see their personal tax allowances cut. Meanwhile, for the poorest pensioners there were increases in the rates of Income Support which, though not due until October, have been included in our analysis. The combined effect of these changes is to leave more than three-quarters of married pensioners better off, and almost all single pensioners with a real increase in income. Indeed, it is single pensioners in particular who do well since they will often be older and poorer; they stand to make full gains from the increases to Income Support. Looking at the employed population there are average gains across the board. The largest gains go to couples where both partners are working since they are both able to take advantage of the new reduced rate of income tax, and this explains why their gains are, on average, substantially larger than those for single earner couples. The gains for multiple family households (for example those with a married couple and a grown-up child out at work) are larger still, again reflecting the fact that the more taxpayers there are in the household, the larger is the gain from the income tax cut. A second way of analysing the effects of the Budget measures is to consider their effect on households with different levels of income. In the second chart, we show the average gain and the proportions gaining and losing at different income levels. Since our definition of income includes only earnings and investment incomes it should be noted that most unemployed families or pensioners will fall within the poorest categories. A first surprising feature of our analysis by income range is that the only group to suffer losses in real terms is the very richest. In order to understand this result it must be remembered that we are comparing what the chancellor actually did with a 'do nothing' Budget which simply increases tax thresholds and allowances in line with inflation. In fact, as far as higher rate taxpayers are concerned, the chancellor did worse than nothing. Instead, he actually froze the threshold at which higher rate tax becomes payable. Thus as earnings increase during the coming year, more people will find themselves paying higher rate tax than would have been the case if the chancellor had chosen to index this threshold. This is a real loss to better-off families, and it is somewhat disingenuous to suggest that no group faces an increase in their direct tax. If the chancellor is willing to quote figures for the increase in pensioner incomes during the 1980s after allowing for inflation, then should he not also assess the effects of his own Budget against an indexed base? It might, however, be argued that higher-rate taxpayers will gain from the reduced rate band and this is indeed true. The reduced rate band saves the vast majority of taxpayers 5 per cent of Pounds 2,000, or Pounds 100 a year. However, the chancellor cut the higher rate threshold by Pounds 1,100 in real terms. Since every pound taxed at the higher rate rather than the basic rate costs a higher rate taxpayer 15p, then an allowance cut of Pounds 1,100 costs such taxpayers Pounds 165 per year. This more than offsets the gains from the reduced rate band. When we look further down the income distribution we see that the largest gains are concentrated among those households with incomes in the Pounds 13,000 to Pounds 31,000 range. How does this sit with the chancellor's statement that the majority of the gains would go to individuals below average income? In fact, the two results are consistent. What our charts show is the incomes of complete households. Thus where two partners are both out at work, their incomes are aggregated because they are being classified by household income. We have already seen that it is households where two or more people are working who gain most from the Budget and this chart is telling us the same story. However, Mr Lamont's claim related not to households but to individuals. It is indeed true that much of the gain from the income tax change will go to individuals with below average earnings. All our chart says is that such individuals are not necessarily living in poor households. At the very lowest income levels, the proportion of losers, though small, is larger than for the population as a whole. This is primarily due to the increases in excise duties, and the people involved are typically working age people not currently in the labour market who do not benefit from the tax changes. Conversely, the gainers at very low incomes are pensioners either currently receiving Income Support or brought on to Income Support by the increased rates announced yesterday. Taken together, our results seem to suggest that what we have seen is a Budget which has given benefits primarily to middle-income households with small numbers of losers at both extremes of the income distribution. Given the chancellor's expressed concern for those on low pay, this might seem a surprising result. However, the introduction of a reduced rate band is in fact not the best way to help low-paid taxpayers. A person with small amounts of taxable income would far prefer to pay no tax than a reduced rate of tax. Though this may seem self-evident, the chancellor has eschewed the most obvious mechanism for bringing this result about, namely the increasing of personal tax allowances. Indeed, in the case of the married couple's allowance he has ensured that, compared with an indexed Budget, more low earners will be paying income tax than would otherwise have been the case. With regard to the introduction of a reduced rate band, the chancellor repeated a claim more often heard from the Labour benches that the starting rate of tax and National Insurance paid by the low paid is too high. However, what is presumably of most importance to someone on low pay is not the amount of tax paid on the last pound of additional income, but rather the average tax rate on the whole of their income. To float people out of income tax by over-indexing personal allowances reduces their average and marginal income tax rate to zero. Instead, the chancellor has reduced their marginal rate to 20 per cent. Surely the former option would receive the vote of the low-paid who Mr Lamont was seeking to target? It is a common fallacy to reason that because the vast majority of taxpayers face a marginal tax rate of 25 per cent, we do not have a progressive income tax system. The defining characteristic of a progressive tax system is that as incomes rise the share of income taken in tax also rises. As we have noted with regard to the low paid, what matters is not the rate on the marginal pound but the rate on the whole of income. On this criterion, the UK income tax system is, in fact, strikingly progressive. The latest Inland Revenue figures suggest that for a taxpayer with taxable income below Pounds 5,000 per year, about 4 per cent of income went in tax; for someone with slightly more than average earnings (Pounds 15,000 to Pounds 20,000), the share of income taken in tax rises to 16 per cent; and for the highest earners (those with more than Pounds 40,000 per year), the share of income taken in tax stands at 30 per cent. Thus the UK does indeed have a progressive tax system, despite the wide basic rate band. In fact, what makes the UK tax system progressive is not so much the tax rates themselves but rather the relatively high level of tax-free personal allowances. For the same cost as introducing a reduced rate band the chancellor could have increased personal tax allowances by substantially more than inflation and in doing so could have taken more than 500,000 people out of income tax altogether. Instead, he chose to lower the starting rate. In terms of overall tax progressivity this was clearly preferable to a general reduction in the basic rate of tax, but equally clearly inferior to a substantial increase in tax-free allowances. The low-paid should be giving only one-and-a-half cheers to Mr Lamont this morning.</p>

			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / UN agrees Bosnia air ban THE UN Security Council yesterday approved a ban on military flights in the air space of Bosnia-Hercegovina and threatened future enforcement action if the resolution was violated. The UN Protection Force (Unprofor) in Yugoslavia will monitor compliance by stationing observers at airfields throughout the former federation. The council's decision, adopted by 14 votes to 0 with China abstaining, came after a week of intense negotiations. The US agreed with Britain and France on a compromise text, having previously sought immediate council authority for the downing of Serb aircraft that contravened the ban. What could be a two-stage programme has now been created, with the council committed by the resolution to 'consider urgently the further measures necessary to enforce this ban if it is contravened'. UN and EC observers will monitor the implementation, which is expected to be rapid, and will include the use of satellites, radar-equipped AWACs and other reconnaissance aircraft. The ban went into effect the instant the resolution was adopted. Sir David Hannay, the UK delegate, warned: 'Anybody who believes this ban can be flouted without their being noticed is in for a nasty surprise.' Meanwhile, it was reported that Serb and Croat leaders from Bosnia-Hercegovina yesterday agreed to a ceasefire, indicating that the two leaders are pushing through their programme of dividing the republic at the expense of the Moslems. Mr Radovan Karadzic, the leader of Bosnia's Serb forces, and Mr Mate Boban, his Croatian counterpart, while attending peace talks in Geneva, agreed to an unconditional ceasefire, the Belgrade-based Tanjug news agency said yesterday in a report which was later denied by Mr Karadzic. Meanwhile, Sarajevo radio yesterday reported a strong Bosnian counter-offensive around Brcko and Gradacac, in northern Bosnia.</p>

			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / UK Company News: Banks agree Heron refinancing - Ronson family faces loss of control if creditors approve deal BANKERS TO Heron International have agreed terms of a Pounds 1.4bn debt restructuring that should allow the property and trading group, founded by Mr Gerald Ronson, to avoid insolvency proceedings. Some 15,000 holders of the bearer bonds will receive the proposals within 28 days and will be asked to approve the restructuring at creditor meetings in June. If the deal is approved, control of the group will pass from Ronson family interests and its charitable trust. The banks will end up with 43 per cent of the equity and bondholders 52 per cent, diluting existing shareholders to a 5 per cent stake. In addition, banks and bondholders will receive 30p in the pound in senior sterling denominated debt and 7p in the pound in junior debt. The restructuring plan envisages the sale of Heron's property interests by March 1997. But repayment of the senior debt will only be possible if there is a modest improvement in the property market. Repayment of the junior debt will require a more substantial improvement. Once the junior and senior debt has been repaid - about Pounds 382m - the Heron management will be able to exercise options that could give them a 25 per cent stake in a revamped group. Heron management will not receive cash bonuses for hitting debt repayment targets, as had been proposed. Mr Ronson has also succeeded in maintaining direct family control of the service station business from which he built his property and trading empire 30 years ago. An investor group controlled by Ronson family trusts will buy 24 service stations from Heron. The investor group has not, however, been allowed to buy the Heron Suzuki franchise. Heron has also provided a further Pounds 100m of provisions against the value of its Spanish property portfolio and foreign exchange losses. As a result, the group's negative net worth, as of March 1992, rose to Pounds 328m from positive net assets of Pounds 585m in March 1991. After the debt for equity swap, pro forma net assets were about Pounds 10m, but will have fallen further. Before the restructuring, the company's value had been hit by: a Pounds 300m write-down in the European property portfolio, leaving it at about Pounds 700m, and Pounds 200m in US properties. A further Pounds 400m of reductions includes Pounds 75m from UK housebuilding, which is up for sale; the write-off of Heron's interest in Control Securities; the cost of cancelling currency and interest rate swaps; and a Pounds 35m provision for the Pounds 50m cost of the restructuring.</p>

			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Book Review: Tomes of endearment TONY BENN: THE END OF AN ERA, DIARIES 1980-90 By Tony Benn Hutchinson Pounds 25, 687 pages 'Tuesday 3 June 1980: The Daily Mail had the headline, 'Centre Party to be formed on Monday', claiming that Roy Jenkins was going to resign as president of the European Commission within a month and return to British politics. I think it is unlikely.' Thus begins the fifth and final volume of the diaries of Tony Benn. As so often, Benn had it wrong. Jenkins did return, and his role in the formation of the Social Democratic party and the alliance with the Liberals was seminal in British politics for much of the 1980s. It was a challenge to Mrs Thatcher, who withstood it, and it had a devastating effect on the fortunes of the already crumbling Labour party. Still, we should not judge Benn as a forecaster, but more as a chronicler of the times or, more accurately, the times as he saw them. As he puts it in a diary entry during February 1981: 'I do not leak. I am a diarist. I am the Hansard of the party.' To the general reader, this volume will seem less riveting than its predecessors. The reason is simple. After Benn's narrow defeat in his challenge to Denis Healey for the deputy leadership of the Labour party in 1981 - a contest that was electric at the time and occupies much of the first 150 pages - he became increasingly out of touch with mainstream politics, even in his own party. Those who have followed the diaries so far, however, will delight in this coda. It reveals a great deal about the man. Perhaps in the end he will go down as a rather charming English eccentric, and not the wrecker that he sometimes seemed. His principal characteristic was that he was a late developer. Benn appears never to have gone into a library with an open mind. He relied on books sent to him by his admirers, such as the professor of politics, Ralph Miliband. He seems to have discovered the French revolution only in the 1980s, so much so that there are several references to it in these diaries and he even notes its 200th anniversary. He also picked up fashions rather than set them. Long after most of the educated public must have realised that there was a women's movement, Benn hears about it from the (then) communist, Bea Campbell, and recalls that he has heard something before from his daughter, Melissa. He must have picked up vegetarianism in much the same way. In Dundee in 1982, he notes: 'We went for a meal with the Lord Provost. I didn't eat the gammon steak - I should say that Caroline (his wife) and I gave up eating meat about 18 months ago - just the chips, the peas and the pineapple ring.' Benn's taste in politicians is equally revealing. He came to distrust Michael Foot later on because of Foot's alleged move to the right. Neil Kinnock he disliked and distrusted from the start. When Kinnock introduced the pink rose as the party symbol, Benn wrote his own words to The Red Flag: 'The people's rose in shades of pinks/Gets up my nostrils and it stinks.' He could not stand Edward Kennedy, who reminded him of Roy Jenkins. He thought that Stuart Holland, once a young ambitious Labour MP on the left, would make a better foreign secretary than David Owen. He was not entirely disrespectful of Roy Hattersley. It was the Tory individuals he preferred - Margaret Thatcher, of course, because she put her own stamp on the Tory party just as he would have liked to have done to the Labour party. He learned and approved of how she did it from the young William Waldegrave. There were others: Geoffrey Howe, Julian Amery and Enoch Powell are all commended in different ways. Of Powell, he notes: 'Although Enoch is a nationalist and I am an internationalist, there is a sort of commonality of interest between us.' Michael Heseltine, on the other hand, reminded him of Kinnock. Keith Joseph was a favourite. Once they met on the railway platform at Bristol, 'got into an empty first-class compartment and talked all the way back to London'. At Paddington the engine driver called out: 'I wish I could get a picture of you two buggers for the newspapers.' The eternal boy scout had his endearing traits. When he lost his seat in parliament and had to pay for his own mail, Benn, the former postmaster general, was astonished by the 'astronomic' cost of postage stamps. The former minister of technology puts a hammer through the bowl while trying to mend the lavatory seat. And the man who wanted to transform society admits: 'I just can't cope with financial matters.' Nevertheless, he tells it all and all five volumes have been wonderfully edited by Ruth Winstone. Towards the end, there is a prophetic gem: '9 March 1989 - William Cash, a young right-wing Tory MP, told me that the Tory party was on the point of splitting over the federalisation of the Common Market . . . the issue would realign British politics in a way comparable to the alliance of John Bright and Disraeli at the time of 1867 Reform Bill. This,' Benn comments, 'was music to my ears.'</p>

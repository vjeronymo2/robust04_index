			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Town hall trench tactics: The (lack of) upheaval in English councils English local government is about to go back to the future - or, more accurately, forward to the past. The result of Sir John Banham's Local Government Commission, the agency in charge of planning the reorganisation of English councils, looks increasingly likely to be the restoration of the system as it was before 1974, when local maps were last redrawn. That outcome might not seem obvious from the controversial recommendations the commission has made so far. But with proposals for 33 of the 36 English shire counties published, the survival of county councils, albeit in some cases without their largest towns, is now probable across much of the country. Some 30 large towns and cities seem set to take over all local government functions for their citizens, in effect restoring the old county boroughs swept away in 1974. Ministers are startled by this prospect. They intended the commission to be the engine of radical change. Both Mr Michael Heseltine, who set up the commission when environment secretary in 1991, and his successor, Mr John Gummer, favoured a nationwide system of unitary councils which combined the functions of counties and districts. But the mechanism chosen for drawing up reform plans now looks almost designed to ensure ministers' grandiose ambitions would not be realised. Learning from the unpopular 1974 reorganisation, handled by a royal commission, Mr Heseltine decided the approach this time should be consultative, treating each county individually. Superficially, the commission has drawn up a plan in line with Mr Heseltine's original intentions, recommending that 22 county councils that should be replaced by unitaries. But it is clear such radical change will not happen: the commission has failed to find much support for unitary councils and has said the status quo should be an option in 13 of the counties recommended for abolition. Where change is likely is in towns which would regain county borough status under the commission's proposals and the fastest-growing newer towns, such as Milton Keynes and Swindon, which will be added to that list, mostly with support from residents. There is also a consensus in other areas in favour of unpicking the 1974 changes. All counties created by the 1974 reorganisation, such as Avon and Humberside, have been recommended for abolition, while Herefordshire, Huntingdonshire and Rutland, which disappeared in 1974 would be reinstated. But the commission hit problems when trying to construct unitary authorities outside cities. It believes a minimum population of 150,000 is needed to make a unitary authority financially viable. In rural areas, that requires a large geographical area. For example, the proposed unitary version of the North Riding of Yorkshire would merge four district councils and stretch almost from the North Sea to the Irish Sea - dubbed 'Shambleshire' by the Association of District Councils. Mrs Ann Levick, the commissioner with responsibility for Northumberland, said 48 per cent of local people had supported unitary authorities in principle, but 'when you give them something specific the principle fades slightly'. This week saw the formation of the Save Oxfordshire's Southern Borders Campaign, which objects to a proposal that a unitary Reading authority should include part of Oxfordshire. The Campaign for Cornwall - one of the three counties for which proposals have not been announced - is already trying to persuade the commission that splitting the county would 'undermine the strength of Cornwall's voice' and leave the county 'vulnerable to territorial expansion by Plymouth'. Birmingham University's Institute of Local Government Studies says the commission's attempt to find unitary solutions is leading it 'to argue the case for a size of authority which will often neither reflect local community identity nor be able to carry out strategic functions'. Another obstacle to creating unitaries is the cost. Initially ministers assumed reorganisation would save money. But the commission's own estimates suggest that some of its 'first-choice' proposals for restructuring counties into unitaries could be prohibitively expensive. For example, its proposal to cut Surrey into five unitaries could cost as much as Pounds 44m, with annual savings of only Pounds 1m. The review has also run into an unexpectedly strong political opposition, which bears similarities to the unholy alliance of unions and traditionalists which thwarted proposals for Sunday trading. Local government unions are opposed to the review because they believe it would fragment local services and endanger jobs. The Labour party supports unitary councils in principle, but says it will vote against reorganisation proposals unless guarantees are made for council employees' job security. Conservative grandees also oppose reform. Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary and an Oxfordshire MP, supports the status quo in the county. All four Somerset Conservative MPs, including Mr Tom King, former defence secretary, oppose abolishing the county. The commission also now seems to have doubts about reorganisation. Sir John himself says: 'Any reorganisation costs more and delivers less than its proponents suggest.' If the status quo emerges as a popular option after the extensive consultative exercise on which it is now embarking (leaflets are being sent to every household), the commission could drop its main recommendations for changes without embarrassment. Sir John clearly believes this could happen. 'In all the surveys we've done, the level of popular support for unitary districts in shire England is very low indeed,' he said last month. 'People in shire England do not want to see a Balkanisation of local government.' Perhaps significantly, ministers have recently gone quiet about their desire for unitary councils. The review was a hopeless vehicle to deliver it in any case. As one commissioner put it: 'A leisurely review like this might have been used for some tinkering at the edges, but it would be impossible to push through anything more radical.' Opponents will have plenty of opportunities to try to block changes when they are debated individually in Parliament. As a result, the new local government map will almost certainly be very different from the one ministers had in mind. But as it is due to be implemented at about the time of the next general election they may be grateful that the commission has offered an escape route from the original plan for root-and-branch reform.  ------------------------------------------- Banham's map for English local government  ------------------------------------------- Counties to be abolished; status quo not an option  ------------------------------------------- Avon Bedfordshire Berkshire Cambridgeshire Cleveland Cumbria Dorset Humberside Isle of Wight North Yorkshire Somerset  ------------------------------------------- Unitary councils opposed; status quo an option  ------------------------------------------- Buckinghamshire Cheshire East Sussex Lancashire Hereford and Worcester Norfolk Northamptonshire Oxfordshire Suffolk Surrey Wiltshire Warwickshire  ------------------------------------------- Status quo preferred option  ------------------------------------------- Derbyshire Devon Durham Essex Gloucestershire Hampshire Kent Leicestershire Lincolnshire Northumberland Nottinghamshire Staffordshire West Sussex  ------------------------------------------- Counties with no proposals till September  ------------------------------------------- Cornwall &amp; Scilly Isles Hertfordshire Shropshire  ------------------------------------------- Cities booked for unitary status  ------------------------------------------- Basildon/Thurrock Bournemouth/Christchurch Brighton Bristol Darlington Hartlepool Hove-Worthing Hull Ipswich Langbaurgh Leicester Luton Medway towns Middlesbrough Milton Keynes Northampton Norwich Nottingham Oxford Plymouth Poole Portsmouth Reading Slough Southampton Southend Stockton-on-Tees Stoke-on-Trent/Newcastle-under-Lyme Swindon Warrington Windsor &amp; Maidenhead/Wokingham York  ------------------------------------------- Source: Local Government Commission for England  -------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> May 28, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / 72ND ASSEMBLY DISTRICT;  </P> <P> YUDELSON DONATIONS MOSTLY FROM L.A. COUNTY  </P> <P> Jerry Yudelson, who has campaigned as the Democrat with the deepest roots in  central Orange County's 72nd Assembly District, received most of his  contributions over the past two months from Los Angeles County, according to  campaign finance statements.  </P> <P> The bulk of the money that Yudelson raised in the two-month period ended May 19  came from the entertainment community, in which his wife has worked as an  actress.  </P> <P> Several celebrities are on the contribution list, including Leonard Nimoy,  James Brolin, Alan Rachins, Corbin Bernson, Gary Busey and Peggy Lipton Jones.  Rachins, who stars with Bernson on the television show "L.A. Law," hosted a  fund-raiser for Yudelson at his home in Pacific Palisades earlier this month.  </P> <P> "It's just that this is not a wealthy district," Yudelson said Saturday. "If  you get 10% of your money out of this district, or 5%, you'd be doing good."  </P> <P> Yudelson reported that he received almost $15,000 in contributions of more than  $100 each. Of that amount, less than $1,000 came from within the 72nd District.  </P> <P> Yudelson said most of his contributions of less than $100 are from within the  district. Election laws do not require a candidate to disclose the identity of  small donors, and Yudelson declined to release his list.  </P> <P> Yudelson reported $6,025 in small donations. With his larger donations and  non-monetary contributions, he reported just over $27,000 raised during the  two-month period.  </P> <P> The major theme of Yudelson's campaign has been to compare his activities and  ties within the district to those of his Democratic primary opponent, Tom  Umberg. Umberg moved into the district from Irvine earlier this year to  campaign for the seat held by Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove).  </P> <P> The predominantly Democratic district includes parts of the cities of Garden  Grove, Santa Ana, Stanton, Anaheim and Westminster.  </P> <P> The issue of carpetbagging looms as a theme that may carry through the general  election, since Pringle has lived in Garden Grove for 22 years and Yudelson  moved into the area shortly before his 1988 campaign against Rep. Robert K.  Dornan (R-Garden Grove).  </P> <P> "You have the choice between two carpetbaggers," Pringle said. "I've lived  here."  </P> <P> Yudelson said the contributions he received from Los Angeles came largely  because of his background as an environmentalist. He is an energy conservation  consultant and was appointed to the state Solar Business Office in 1978 by  then-Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr.  </P> <P> "My biggest theme has been the environment, and there are a tremendous number  of people interested in air pollution looking to pick up a vote in the Assembly  on environmental issues," Yudelson said.  </P> <P> Umberg, a former federal prosecutor, has emphasized a tough-on-crime campaign  theme, and the bulk of his contributions in the recent two months came from  lawyers. Umberg also received most of his money from outside the district,  although his report included slightly more district donations than Yudelson's.  </P> <P> Umberg had raised a total of about $49,000 during the period, including $1,155  in non-monetary contributions and $4,700 in donations under $100.  </P> <P> Umberg was not available for comment on Sunday.  </P></p>

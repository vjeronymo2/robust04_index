			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Host of constraints hinder Egypt: World Bank study seeks agenda for regenerating the private sector - A report urging the creation of 5m jobs by 2000 A host of embedded legal, regulatory, tax, financial, bureaucratic and judicial constraints are impeding the growth of Egypt's private sector, despite 'remarkable results' in the country's macro-economic reform programmes, an exhaustive World Bank study* designed to create a sweeping agenda for private-sector regeneration says. The report, the most detailed to be prepared on Egypt's private sector, is an attempt to explain why private investment has failed to respond to almost three years of largely successful International Monetary Fund and World Bank-guided stabilisation policies. It underlines the urgency of the task by estimating that the private sector must create 5m jobs by the year 2000 even to halve the present 20 per cent unemployment rate, given present population growth of more than 2 per cent. Even moderate GDP growth of about 3.5 per cent a year would require a real doubling in levels of private investment between now and 2000, the report says. The bulk of prospective new jobs would most likely come from small private companies employing fewer than nine workers, which comprise 99 per cent of the country's non-agricultural private-sector enterprises. But these lack access to credit, physical space and markets, are largely ignored by economic policy-makers and often prefer to remain small to avoid contact with cumbersome tax, legal and other bureaucratic restraints. The 'rigid regulatory environment' of the socialist 1960s under President Gamal Nasser 'pushed a large sector of private enterprise into informality and engendered reluctance to graduate out of it,' while government incentives have been heavily biased towards big domestic and international investors. 'The result was a private sector with distinct polarity and weak linkages.' The report identifies a raft of constraints on the private sector as a whole including: Lack of clarity and open information on progress in liberalising the economy, breeding uncertainty among prospective investors; Complex and restrictive labour laws, along with a lack of adequate anti-trust, consumer protection and trade legislation; Complex and prohibitive regulations on corporate approval and licensing; Generally inefficient and poor-calibre public institutions. Time-consuming and expensive commercial judicial practices dating from 'a planned socialist economy where private commercial disputes were not the norm'; Inadequate sources of credit for small and medium-sized businesses and a scarcity of adequately educated workers, particularly of management calibre; cumbersome and time-consuming tax administration. These constraints are 'closely inter-related and crucial in toto,' adding that piecemeal efforts to relax them might still not bring about a flourishing private sector. 'The real overall constraint to Egypt's private sector is the lack of an appropriate business environment.' To all this, the report adds the need for the government to expand and accelerate its privatisation programme, noting that 'in the two years since the privatisation programme started, no actual transfer of controlling ownership has taken place,' while more aggressively seeking foreign investment and stimulating private manufacturing exports. On the latter, it states that non-oil merchandise exports have been declining continuously for a decade and are at just a third of their level in 1983 at current dollar values. Such exports would have to more than double between now and the year 2000 to keep the balance-of-payments deficit to below 5 per cent of GDP. Given its wide-ranging findings, the report states perhaps with understatement that 'more than three decades of central planning call for a good degree of realism in the setting of Egypt's market-driven development targets', calling private-sector development a formidable task. The authors hope the report will concentrate government and Egyptian business minds on the topic, which they say is of paramount importance in securing real gains from the reform programme. The document is to be the centrepiece of a two-day conference in Cairo next week, gathering the bank, the government and leading Egyptian businessmen in an attempt to create an 'agenda for action'. *Private Sector Development in Egypt: The Status and The Challenge; The World Bank; Washington DC.</p>

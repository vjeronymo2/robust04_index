			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / UK Company News: The Battle For Midland - MPs could hold the whip hand / Parliament may have the power to block merger of banking assets MEMBERS OF Parliament may have the power to block the merger of Lloyds Bank and Midland's banking assets if Britain's third largest clearer wins the battle for its rival. Such a move, which could only occur after a Lloyds victory, would potentially undermine the commercial logic of the tie-up by limiting Lloyds' ability to improve the efficiency of a joint network. Lloyds is competing with Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation to take over its fellow clearer, which was once the world's largest bank. The opportunity for MPs to intervene arises because of the need for an Act of parliament to transfer assets and liabilities from one bank to another. Lloyds referred to this last month when it said that 'the transfer of Midland Bank's assets and liabilities to Lloyds Bank would require an Act of parliament.' The bank would expect this to take place in 1993, 'thereafter all Midland Bank branch banking activities would be conducted under Lloyds Bank's name.' The normal procedure for obtaining the Act would involve lodging a petition with the House of Commons on or before November 27, giving the private bill the chance to be processed in that parliamentary session. It is quite common for private bills - which have historically been used chiefly to clear the way for the construction or extension of railway lines  -to pass through the House unopposed and hence undebated. Hongkong Bank argues that current concerns about the possible impact of a Lloyds-Midland merger on competition and employment levels in the banking sector are so pronounced that some MPs may decide to attempt to block the bill's passage. Even if they do not, it suggests, a referral of the Lloyds offer to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission would make it difficult for its rival to get its bill into the next parliamentary timetable. This could delay the lodging of a petition until November 1993 and the measure's enactment until July 1994 or later. A little-used mechanism exists for the late lodging of petitions but express permission from the parliamentary authorities is needed. Parliamentary officers state that in recent years fewer private bills have completed their passage through Westminster in a single session than formerly for a variety of reasons. Of bills for which petitions were lodged in November 1990, just four had received their assent by the end of the parliamentary year in 1991 against 19 which had not. Hongkong does not expect its own proposals to require the passage of a private bill because it intends to run Midland as a discrete entity. Mr Bernard Asher, a Hongkong Bank executive director, disclosed last week that the bank would nonetheless make cuts in Midland's 1,900-strong branch network and in its treasury operations. Lloyds advisers think it unlikely that MPs would seek to impede the private bill's progress because the takeover to which it related would by then have received the authorities' blessing and because of the additional uncertainty for Midland account-holders such a course of action would provoke. They do not anticipate that the time a bill would take to pass would present a problem because Lloyds would not wish to effect the transfer of assets immediately following a takeover. 'The timetables tend to mesh,' said one adviser. Senior executives of both Midland suitors will have meetings with Conservative backbenchers later this week.</p>

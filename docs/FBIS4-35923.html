			<p>BFN     [Text] The soldiers in the war of liberation against the  British, and their brave young people in Radfan Province have  sent the following cable to the chairman and members of the  Presidential Council and the command of the Armed Forces in the  Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY]: We send you our warmest  congratulations on the occasion of the declaration of the DRY,  on behalf of our colleagues Labbuzah, Thabit Husayn al-Uqbi, and  other strugglers in the war of liberation, and send you a  suitable gift contained in what follows:    A group of fighters in the war of liberation and their brave  youths attacked the invading enemy forces as they arrived at one  of the remote villages in Radfan Province. A fierce battle  ensued, lasting from 1100 on 3 June until the dawn of the  following day. The following losses were inflicted on the enemy:  Three military vehicles destroyed, 60 men killed, and a number  of others wounded. One of our colleagues was martyred, while six  others were lightly wounded. In response, the enemy proceeded  to shell villages indiscriminately, martyring a citizen and  wounding a number of others. We promise our political  leadership in the DRY that we shall deal with these new  occupiers just as we dealt with the colonialists, and shall not  give up an inch of the territory of the DRY. This is a promise  from strong and loyal strugglers: We shall rout the attacking  forces, and victory will be our ally, God willing.</p>

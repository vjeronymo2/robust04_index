			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Property: Mixed fortunes in the housing horoscope - What does 1992 hold for the property market? John Brennan takes an astrologer's view . . . UNDERSTANDABLE caution pervades most previews of the 1992 property market. Yet, there is no shortage of data from which to form a picture. The trick is to blend the industry's more cautious, subtle and private views into the random time segments thrown up by astrological dates. So, let us see-in the year's housing prospects with the stars. CAPRICORN CHILL (December 22-January 21) After the holidays, it is too chilly and icy for much viewing. Fear of the heavily-publicised world-wide 'flu epidemic keeps more people at home. This is, however, a good time for hardy hunters of the limited number of good country houses on the market in the lower to middle price range (Pounds 200-400,000). Try to see the house at work (ideally, by arriving unannounced one morning) ) and take the opportunity to talk with the owner; perhaps, even, to work out a deal. If he is afraid of values leaping just as he sells, you might - lawyer close at hand - work out a simple agreement where, a year later, you pay the difference (if any) in value of the house, less inflation and any improvements you may have made. AQUARIUS ARISING (January 21-February 19). With pre-election political analysis proliferating, most people will have been educated to appreciate that the embarrassing little increase in interest rates (to preserve an over-valued pound's status on the ERM) is more of a technicality than a higher cost of money. So, this is a good time for couples and families to get out into the high streets to look at all the great-value properties on offer. There are bound to be a couple of 'just in' properties on offer in every sales agent's office. The blunt fact is that the rest are still listed because they have yet to sell at the asking price. For a property window-shopper in February, when the nights still close in early, there will be little patience for anything but the neatest sales story. As for there being a wider choice of homes to sell, we hit the political wall. Few homes are expected to be prepared for the new sales season. Unless there appears to be some exceptional end-of-year performance, that new sales season will not be until after the election. Everything hinges on the man in the grey suit. PISCES SURPRISES (February 19-March 20. News of impressive central London house and flat sales encourage popular-newspaper headlines to hint at a house price revival. This has been a regular feature of housing market coverage for years. The reality is that in this most specialised of the many layers of the market a number of the best connected and most energetic agents have used their skills to keep selling a few high-value homes since 1988. In fact, in this period the supply of super-prime property is thin. This real-life supply/demand imbalance at the top of the town market stands at odds to the number of dramatically advertised, super-luxury properties available in London today. The difference between the real and the public list involves extrapolating those schemes that are on the market at prices aimed at bankers' and shareholders' eyes only. Why should tales of big-number purchases in Belgravia have any impact on Barnsley? Because this is the 'cheer-up' time of the election year. In any event, Conservative party-supporting newspapers will be snapping around the heels of housing industry chiefs to get a nice selection of 'light at the end of a tunnel' comments. ARIES ASTOUNDS (March 20-April 21) Against every rational argument, the housing 'revival' ('boom' is banned) is here again. The popular newspapers trawl the country for tales of cheer and resale profits as building society researchers find that, allowing for reasonable mathematical error on a sample base that they would not like to elaborate upon, it does seem that property values do tend to go up, all things being equal. Finding evidence of rising prices is no problem for a news reporting team aimed in that direction. This is also the time of year at which builders paste on their broadest smiles and trail exceptional items to end the financial year on a happy note. There is also the CBI, which may be sure, if asked, to have spotted that the recession is at an end and that all is well again in the economy. TAURUS TORTURES (April 21-May 22), GEMINI JEWELS (May 22-June 22), CANCER CONFUSION (June 22-July 23) Into the astrological void of a possible general election. An election would dash any artificial flurry of activity on the residential market, although housebuilders should be able to keep some of the extra viewers drawn out by the weather and the positive press comments. Talk of a revival may have to be artificial, but anything that draws a crowd helps the salesmen. Once there is an election date, one can track the fortunes of the competing parties through opinion polls, and we are unlikely to be in much doubt of the outcome by the time it comes to a vote. Unless, that is, we have the worst outcome: an indecisive result and a hung parliament, where the balance of power is held by such conviction politicians as the Ulster Unionists. It is not the housing policies of the Ulstermen that would upset the residential property market, but rather the high probability of another election inside a few months. A returned Conservative government would be a comfortable outcome for most of those operating in the private housing sector. It might have been the signal for an exodus of good people from the threadbare social housing system but for the evidence in December 1991 that John Major is a social housing man at heart. A Labour victory would open the door for 'innovative' housing policies. Having had most of the traditional housing controls cut away over the last decade, the process of redrawing a policy on the void would be fascinating. The main factor for most people, however, is that since we are tied to the ERM no domestic political party can woo us with 'that old Black Magic of inflation'. A Labour government used to mean a surge in inflation and a run on the pound; not any more. Those who create charts showing the impact of domestic politics on property values have had to stop and accept that the EC is indifferent. LEO ROARS (July 23-August 24) Potentially one of the strongest home sales periods of the year - no matter who wins the election - as prospective buyers finally start to make offers. However, a greatly increased number of people will be checking whether a rental does not suit them just as well. Most of the town and country properties that have been hovering in the wings for months before finding the right time to be 'marketed' should come into view at this time. Launched to benefit from the shortage-induced price fillip earlier in the year, this avalanche of good houses acts as a bar on any increases in value for the rest of the year, and well into the spring of 1993. This is good for vendors, good for buyers, good, in that it regenerates turnover, for sales agencies. The only confused sounds are in the background as headline writers try to say that the housing market is well again, but that prices are static or weak: 'Housing Boom as Prices Slide' may hit the mark. VIRGO ON HOLIDAY (August 24th-September 23) This is reaction time: reaction to the election, to the subsequent serious economic news (all heavyweight eco-news becomes increasingly hard to extract once the election campaign starts); reaction to the idea that something different might be happening. Unemployment and job security are unlikely to be much affected, but mortgage money may not be as cheap and easy to get. There is no way of telling how the mortgage lenders will react to the pressure they have been put under to bail out bad payers. Whether that will make the lenders amenable to a lively home buyers' money sale at the same time is a moot point. LIBRA LAUGHING (September 23-October 23) New statistics show that house prices nationally are 2 to 3 per cent lower than in 1991. On the other hand, the volume of sales is picking up by 50,000 transactions a month. This is the real - but unremarked - turning point to the housing market, the low point of the slump in price and volume terms. However, from this time forth there can be none of the usual price surges or slumps. Thanks to our membership of the ERM, the bottom of the slump no longer presages a ride up the other side. SCORPIO SALES (October 23-November 23) Now is the calm after madness, the period when an overdose of facts and counter-facts, offers and counter-offers, bargains and super-bargains wears off and reality becomes clear again. There are a great many new houses left unsold from last year and completed this year; there are plenty of repossessions and near forced-sale houses and flats. In the general housing market there will be ample stock for a more active set of buyers. No one ever will have seen such a selection of quality country houses as the post-election surge leads to the release of every middle class homeowner's dream property. 'Where do they all come from?' is the usual question when faced with a sheaf of sales details of manor houses and rectories. The answer is that they are many idyllic country homes in the UK, but this time around asking prices will be closely in line with what the vendors and agents think to be fair value. Long-distance bargain hunters would not be welcome. SAGITTARIUS SMILES (November 23-December 22) The last few days outside the EC 'single market' provides an opportunity for every TV channel, newspaper and radio station to 'go continental.' Having been only vaguely aware of how the other 11 countries live, our stalwart British homeowner now learns a great truism and loses a faith. Our continental partners might have overtaken us in many things but, as every true-born Brit knows in their bones, Britain's housing system is the envy of the world. Seen through other's eyes, such as those who point out that half the UK's housing stock is past its fall-down date, it can be a shock to appreciate that what we see as a strength in the commitment to owner-occupation may be viewed by our neighbours as an eccentric expense. Growing knowledge about the different ways of treating housing in Europe will have an irreversible effect on the UK market as old truths are challenged.</p>

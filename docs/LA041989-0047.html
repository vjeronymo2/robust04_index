			<p><P> April 19, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AFI FEST HIGHLIGHTS  </P> <P> Following are capsule reviews of today's screenings in the American Film  Institute Los Angeles International Film Festival at the Cineplex Odeon Century  Plaza Cinemas:  </P> <P> 'The Ambassador From India'  </P> <P> Colombia, 1987, 85 minutes  </P> <P> 9:15 p.m.  </P> <P>  Fitfully amusing comedy about a compulsive liar in Colombia who comes to be  lionized by an entire town after affecting an accent and passing himself off as  a visiting ambassador. Out of this escalating mistake, director Mario Ribero  elicits gentle laughs throughout, yet any real satirical potential is dulled by  a weak ending that lets its weak protagonist off the hook. "People see what  they want to see," is the maxim here, but the simplicity of the townspeople  shouldn't excuse the duplicity of the masquerading hero. CHRIS WILLMAN  </P></p>

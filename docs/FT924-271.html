			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / Japanese ministry penalises broker JAPAN'S Ministry of Finance yesterday disciplined Cosmo Securities, a second-tier stockbroker, by ordering it to suspend certain corporate business and bond trading operations. The penalty follows the first completed investigation by the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission, which was established to clean up the industry following the scandals that hit the Tokyo stock market last year. Cosmo is accused of irregularities in dealing with corporate clients. Mr Yasuo Bunya, Cosmo's chairman, has indicated his intention to resign next month. While Cosmo is the first to be punished, most other Japanese brokers have admitted compensating favoured corporate clients for investment losses, and it remains to be seen whether they will also be pursued by the new commission. Cosmo was also not the only company to have concealed clients' losses through the technique known as 'tobashi' - transferring lossmaking stocks from client account to client account in an attempt to avoid booking the loss. The ministry ordered Cosmo to suspend corporate business in Tokyo from January 11 to January 18. It will be forbidden from dealing in convertible bonds on its own account for four weeks from January 11. Three former Cosmo executives are alleged to have compensated select clients for losses by buying their convertible bonds at higher than market prices. The commission said the company continued the compensation even though the ministry said the practice was unlawful. The Finance Ministry blames the compensation scandal for undermining individual investors' confidence in the stock market. Meanwhile, the 'tobashi' dealings have led to court cases against Japanese brokers from companies which say they suffered unfairly by being lumbered with the losing stocks.</p>

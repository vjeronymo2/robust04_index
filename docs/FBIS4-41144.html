			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Taranov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 22 Jun--Today the Russian State Duma  examined the issue of the Russian president's decree "On Urgent  Measures to Protect the Population From Gangsterism and Other  Kinds of Organized Crime". In his report, Viktor Ilyukhin,  chairman of the Security Committee, said that the most resolute  struggle against crime should be mounted. He believes, however,  "illegality cannot be used to fight illegality."    In his address to State Duma deputies, First Deputy Interior  Minister Mikhail Yegorov noted that the painful process of  forming new economic structures is under way in the country.  "The law enforcement bodies know very well who the leaders of  the criminal world are," the general said. "And, in this  respect, the presidential decree makes it possible to deal with  them. We are not going to detain anybody for 30 days. Give us  at least a month. I assume the entire responsibility for  implementing the decree."    Finally, the State Duma adopted a decision to:    1. Draw the Russian Supreme Court's attention to the need to  observe the Russian Constitution and relevant legislation when  examining specific criminal cases;    2. Confirm the fact that norms of the Code of Criminal  Procedure are fully in force in the Russian Federation;    3. Have the State Duma Committees for Security, Legislation,  and Legal and Judicial Reform submit to the State Duma for  examination within two weeks the following draft federal laws:  "On Combating Organized Crime"; "On the Fight Against  Corruption"; "On State Protection for Victims of Crime,  Witnesses, and Other Persons Assisting Legal Proceedings"; "On  State Protection for Judges, Officials and Law Enforcement  Bodies"; "On Russian Federation Counterintelligence Bodies"; "On  the State of Emergency"; "On Keeping in Custody People Suspected  and Accused of Crimes"; "On the Russian Federation  Constitutional Court"; and "On State Service";    4. Invite the Federal Assembly's Federation Council, the  president, and the Russian Government to participate in debating  and improving the above laws in order to speed their passage  through the Russian Federal Assembly and their signing by the  Russian president.    5. Recommend to the Russian president to refrain from  bringing into force Decree No. 1226 of 14 June 1994 "On Urgent  Measures for Protecting the Population From Gangsterism and  Organized Crime" in order to bring it in line with the Russian  Constitution and to submit a draft criminal code, draft code of  criminal procedure, and draft code of criminal execution of the  Russian Federation to the State Duma as soon as possible.</p>

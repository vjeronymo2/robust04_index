			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jaroslav Kmenta] </F>   [Text] This week, the RDP Group arms company has withdrawn,  at the very last moment, its application for a license to trade  in military material. The Ministry of Industry and Trade has  confirmed this. The arms consortium took recourse to this  maneuver after it learned that government authorities were about  to reject the issuance of the arms-trading permit.    The Defense Ministry had serious objections against Jan  Vlcek, director of the company. At the former Federal Defense  Ministry, he was engaged in X-Trade, a subsidized organization  of the Army that sold off surplus military technology to foreign  countries.    In view of the dubious activities of the representatives of  this consortium in Iran recently, the Foreign Ministry wanted to  support the stance of the Defense Ministry. In its confidential  document, they even said that the RDP Group did more harm than  good to the interests of the Czech Republic. "We recommend that  this company be urged to show `restraint' in its activity,"  diplomats said.    The licensing administration of the Ministry of Industry and  Trade was to announce a negative stance to the RDP Group by the  end of this week. In that case, the RDP Group consortium, which  associates about 40 arms enterprises, was under the threat of  not being able to conduct trade in arms at all for at least a  year. According to the law, a firm whose application has been  denied must wait one year to reapply for permission to export  military material.    Not being allowed to trade in military material would  significantly damage the RDP Group because trade in arms was one  of its goals when the consortium was established--apart from  coordinating domestic production of military technology and  participating in the replacement of the Army's arsenal. Experts  estimate that, in the course of one year, the arms company would  lose transactions worth millions of korunas.    The RDP Group wants to reapply for the trade license in  military material as soon as possible. After former diplomat  Viktorie Hradska has been appointed to Vlcek's position, arms  manufacturers expect that ministries will be more inclined to  meet them halfway.</p>

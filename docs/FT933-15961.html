			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / International Bonds: Austria's OKB launches aggressively priced Eurolira offering EUROLIRA issues were again the centre of attention in the international bond market as Osterreichische Kontrollbank (OKB), the Austrian state-backed financial institution, yesterday launched an aggressive L250bn, 10-year deal. OKB is the second borrower in two trading days to launch a deal with a coupon below the psychologically-important 10 per cent level. Investors  - in particular, retail investors in the Benelux countries and Switzerland - have been piling into the Eurolira market in recent months, attracted by the double-digit coupons and high yields available. On Friday the EBRD (which is another triple-A rated name) launched a L200bn, seven-year bond, carrying a 9.75 per cent coupon and yielding 9.75 per cent at launch. However, OKB's deal carries an even lower coupon - of 9.5 per cent - and yielded 9.56 per cent at full fees. Dealers criticised OKB's issue for being 'extremely aggressive', pointing out that the EBRD issue, which has a shorter maturity, yields more than OKB's deal even though the Italian yield curve is positive and gives a 20 basis points pick-up at the 10-year maturity over the seven-year maturity. One dealer drew attention to two World Bank deals, which also mature in 2003 and which are yielding between 9.6 and 9.7 per cent in the secondary market. OKB's issue traded at 99.60 - 99.70 yesterday: in other words, it was 'outside fees' or below 99.625 on the bid side for much of the day, although it picked up later as the market rallied on the back of the Bank of Italy's interest rate cut. Paribas Capital Markets, the lead manager, admitted the deal was aggressive but said there was good demand for 10-year Eurolira issues with current coupons and good liquidity, particularly from investors looking for triple-A rated names. The issue was thought to have been swapped into D-Marks to give funding of at least 30 basis points below London interbank offered rate. The other main feature of the day was a Dollars 480m, four-year bond with warrants issue from Seino Transportation, the large Japanese freight company. The funds will be used for general corporate purposes, according to Nomura, the lead manager. The issue was watched with some interest, given that several Japanese borrowers - including Mitsubishi Oil, NGK Insulators and Sumitomo Cement - are lined up to launch bonds with warrants over the next few weeks. However, Seino Transportation's deal was seen as moving slowly and dealers said some investors were likely to wait until after the election before taking a view on the Japanese market. 'This would have gone better a few weeks ago, before the election was announced,' complained one dealer. The bonds were pretty stable at 98.5 - or within fees - yesterday, while the warrants traded at 13.25.</p>

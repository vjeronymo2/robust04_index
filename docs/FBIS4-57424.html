			<p>BFN     [Text] Port-au-Prince, 18 May (EFE) -- Today,  Constitutional Prime Minister Robert Malval urged Haitian  university students to continue the struggle to preserve  democratic achievements and to defeat conservative forces.    Meanwhile, in a radio and television message, de facto  President Emile Jonassaint called for Haitian unity. Malval and  Jonassaint spoke on separate occasions during the celebrations  to mark University and Flag Day. According to Jonassaint, this  unity is as important "as the unity that led to the creation of  the flag on 18 May 1803."    The U.S., Venezuelan, Taiwan, and Mexican ambassadors, the  Canadian and French charges d'affaires, and the Papal Nuncio met  with Malval at his Chante Brise home to express their support.  In statements to journalists, the diplomats noted that their  presence at Malval's home clearly expresses their rejection of  the "supposed" de facto government and their support for  President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who was overthrown on 30  September 1991 by a military group led by General Raoul Cedras.  The diplomats added that Aristide and Malval represent the  constitutional legitimacy of Haiti.</p>

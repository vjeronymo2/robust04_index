			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Showdown over French skies: John Ridding and Paul Betts say the clash between British airlines and the Paris government tests Europe's policy of deregulating air travel Mr Andrew Gray, managing director of Air UK, is exasperated: 'I can't believe in this day and age it will come to pistols at dawn.' But as his airline, along with British Airways and BA's French affiliate TAT, prepares to defy the French government and launch services on Monday between London and Orly Airport in Paris, a showdown seems hard to avoid. 'It is an absolute test case,' says one airline executive. 'If the French are allowed to win, the European Commission's plans for airline deregulation mean little', he adds, as UK and French government officials were yesterday attempting to resolve the dispute. The row has erupted since Wednesday when Mr Bernard Bosson, the French transport minister, declared that UK carriers could not start flying to Orly on Monday despite last month's ruling by the Commission that the French government must open the airport to competition immediately. The dispute goes to the heart of European efforts during the past three years to liberalise air transport and create a deregulated single European aviation market. Apart from provoking fresh strains between two of the European Union's biggest partners, it has brought to the fore the wide gulf in approach to airline deregulation adopted by different EU countries. It has highlighted the split between the liberal camp - countries such as the UK, the Netherlands and increasingly Germany - and the more interventionist member states led by France and including Italy, Spain, Greece, Portugal and Belgium. The latter group opposes US-style free-for-all airline competition and is pressing for a controlled process of deregulation. The immediate issue in what is being described as 'the Battle for Orly' is access to French domestic routes and France's readiness to liberalise its airline market in line with Europe's 'open skies' policies. The stakes are high, and tempers have become frayed. The UK government has placed its 'full backing' behind the UK carriers. Mr Bosson claims the French government remains committed to opening Orly to more competition, but he said UK flights could not start until a number of problems have been resolved. These include the implementation of measures to ease congestion at Orly and improved access to London's Heathrow airport for French airlines. The French transport ministry believes these problems can be resolved 'within a matter of weeks', and says it does not understand the 'strong-arm tactics' being employed by the British carriers. The demand that services to Orly be delayed, however, has prompted a strong reaction. 'The French authorities have no right to prevent us from flying to Orly,' says Mr David Holmes, BA's head of government affairs. He argues that Air France already has open access to Heathrow and operates more flights to the London airport from the other Paris airport of Charles de Gaulle than BA itself. The high emotions reflect the importance of the issue. For UK airlines, flights from London to Orly would provide a strong foothold into the lucrative domestic French market. Orly, in southern Paris, also provides better connections to internal French flights than does Charles de Gaulle. 'Flying to Orly would strengthen our competitive position against the Channel tunnel,' Mr Holmes says. 'We believe that Orly will prove more popular than Charles de Gaulle,' adds Mr Gray, whose Air UK airline wants to serve Orly from London's Stansted airport. For UK carriers the Orly dispute is also a broader test case for the liberalisation of the French airline market. In addition to its ruling on Orly, the Commission ordered France to open the Orly-Marseilles and Orly-Toulouse routes to competition within six months. These are among the busiest routes in Europe and are currently operated as a monopoly by the French domestic carrier Air Inter, part of the Air France group. From 1997, according to the Commission, all routes within France and other EU member countries must be liberalised. This all adds up to a dilemma for the French government, which is faced with conflicting pressures. The Commission has linked approval of a FFr20bn capital injection for Air France to progress in opening up the domestic French air transport market to competition. The capital increase, to take place over three years, is the centre piece of a rescue plan for Air France, which last year incurred losses of FFr8.5bn. The French state airline's capital increase proposal has already antagonised Air France's big European airline competitors - not only BA but also Lufthansa of Germany - which are campaigning in Brussels against the continuing use of state subsidies to bail out loss-making national flag carriers. 'The artificial maintenance of state-funded airlines continues to provide the biggest obstacle to the development of a truly free, deregulated market,' says Sir Michael Bishop, chairman of British Midland Airways, the second largest UK scheduled carrier which also plans to start services from Heathrow to Orly later this year. Many French consumers also favour deregulation. 'Of course I want more competition,' says the director of a French company. 'When I travel to Britain there is usually a choice of airlines.' But these incentives to deregulate the French market are countered by other factors. Unions at Air Inter oppose liberalisation. 'We will not be the sacrifice for Commission approval of Air France's rescue package,' says an official of the Confederation Generale du Travail, one of the airline's largest unions. The unions have called a strike on Tuesday to demand that competition be introduced only in 'progressive steps'. Air Inter is also reluctant to lose its monopoly on some of its most profitable routes having lost FFr257m last year. The dilemma is clearly felt by Mr Bosson. 'I am accused of being an ultra-liberal by the unions and an ultra-protectionist by Brussels,' he complained last month. But there is a deeper resistance to the process of deregulation in France inherited from the country's dirigiste economic tradition. 'The EU is not simply a zone of free trade, having for its only value the laws of the market,' Mr Bosson said in response to the so-called 'wise men's' report on airline deregulation published last year. The report called for full liberalisation of European routes by 1997. 'The EU must also include a social vision, the values of regional development and public service, which are ignored by considerations of profitability,' he argued. The result of these conflicting interests has been an attempt to play for time and fight for every step in the battle for deregulation. In addition to the delays announced on Wednesday, Paris is appealing to the European Court of Justice about the procedures used in the decision to liberalise the Toulouse and Marseilles routes. However, the need to secure the FFr20bn capital increase for Air France is likely to be the priority. 'After the strikes of last October which forced the climbdown by the Balladur government, Air France has become a powerful political symbol,' said one airline consultant in Paris. 'They cannot afford a refusal of the capital increase.' To assist the process of liberalisation, opposition from Air Inter may be reduced by a reorganisation of its relationship with Air France, a prospect that was raised by Mr Bosson in an address to the National Assembly on Wednesday. The reorganisation seems designed to satisfy Air Inter's long-standing demands for a more autonomous management from its parent. Placating Air Inter will, however, take time. And with BA and Air UK planning to touch down in Orly on Monday, time is something that the French authorities do not have. As one UK airline executive put it: 'The French government has pushed itself in a corner; the moment of truth is due to arrive on the 6.50 flight from London.'</p>

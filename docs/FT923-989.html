			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Honda plans big increase in Swindon workforce HONDA is preparing to recruit the next 600 workers needed to reach the initial 50,000-a-year output of the new car it is about to start building in its Pounds 370m plant at Swindon, Wiltshire. The Japanese carmaker, which already employs 900 people on the 360-acre site, yesterday released the first official pictures of the car. The vehicle, previously code-named Synchro, will use the Accord name that Honda uses throughout the world for its upper-medium saloon range. Honda wants to complete recruitment of the 600 staff before the middle of next year, Mr Shojiro Miyake, managing director of Honda of the UK Manufacturing (HUM), said yesterday. That would allow for sufficient training for Honda to reach its single-shift target of 50,000 cars within 18 months of the start of production. The first cars destined for sale are due off the Swindon lines early next month. It was ironic that Mr Miyake was outlining the recruitment on the day that both Ford and Rolls-Royce announced job cuts against a background of slumping car demand in Britain and several overseas markets. The Swindon plant is scheduled to be employing 2,000 by 1995, when the Japanese group plans to be building 100,000 cars a year on a two-shift system. The Swindon-built Accord, which Honda says will be sold only in the European market, has been developed jointly with Britain's Rover Group. Rover will start production of its own version of the car - expected to be called the Rover 600 - early next year. Mr Miyake said yesterday that the Accord will be launched first in continental Europe, making its debut at the Berlin Motor Show on October 9. It will be launched progressively in other European countries throughout next year and early 1994. Its UK debut is to be in May, with Honda UK, the British sales subsidiary, forecasting 3,500 sales next year rising to 12,000 by 1995. Honda hopes the Swindon-built Accord, and the replacement for the Honda Concerto that the Wiltshire plant will also be building by 1995, will help lift Honda's total Europe sales to between 250,000 and 300,000 a year by the late 1990s. Concertos are now produced by Rover alongside the similar Rover 200 models at Longbridge. To help achieve this increased production target, Honda is also expanding its European dealer network to around 2,000, up from a present total of 1,915. Mr Miyake, who declined to comment on whether Honda would expand Swindon's capacity beyond the 100,000 level in the late 1990s, said Honda was also taking steps to establish a presence in eastern Europe. Although it is not considering production there, it has already set up what it describes as 'representative' offices in Hungary, Poland, Moscow and Czechoslovakia.</p>

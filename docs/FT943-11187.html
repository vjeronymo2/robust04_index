			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / People (Names in the news): Emap's handy Francophile Emap, the successful magazine, newspaper and exhibitions group, is clearly becoming a much more Francophone company, following last month's acquisition of Pounds 108m worth of French magazines, writes Raymond Snoddy. Emap was already in France through a joint venture with Bayard Press. For the past two years new recruits to the company have been expected to offer another language besides English - preferably French. The latest acquisitions comprise 28 titles bought from Editions Mondiales - including Tele Poche, one of the leading television listings magazines - and L'Auto Journal - France's biggest selling motoring journal - bought from Robert Hersant, owner of Le Figaro. The deal makes Emap the third largest consumer magazine group in France, with 860 staff. Clearly, management changes were necessary. David Arculus, Emap managing director, believes that given the company's growth in France it was important to have senior management on the ground. Kevin Hand, the 43-year old chief executive of Emap's consumer magazine division, has just been appointed chairman of Groupe Emap, and is heading for France with his family for at least a year to integrate the new titles. 'People say I'll never be back in a year. Then we move on to the exciting part - launches and acquisitions,' says Hand. For the past three years - apart from visiting the French business - he has been working steadily at his French; he now describes his efforts as 'pas mal.' He concedes that his French colleagues may wince sometimes at what he does to their language, but he thinks he gets high marks for trying. 'If you don't speak French you are going to get dropped from the team,' says Hand, who hopes that increasingly French Emap staff will spend a couple of years working in London and vice versa. He has no doubt there will be further Emap acquisitions in France. 'The calls are already coming - in French,' he says. Hand will remain chief executive of Emap consumer magazines but Tom Moloney, who currently heads four companies covering Emap's teenage, music, entertainment and women's magazines has been appointed deputy chief executive of Emap's UK consumer magazine division.</p>

			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Late US maize planting cuts output expectations DELAYS IN planting maize in the US because of rain are the main reason for an expected reduction in world coarse grain output, the International Wheat Council said yesterday. In its first estimate for 1993, the IWC puts world production at 828m tonnes, down from 1992's record 856m tonnes but well above the five-year average of 804m tonnes. Smaller harvests in Western Europe, the former Soviet Union, South America, China and India also help account for the production decline. Consumption is forecast at 845m tonnes, up from 827m tonnes the previous year. The IWC cites rising animal numbers in the US and strong feed industries growth in middle-income developing countries such as Brazil and Mexico. World trade in coarse grains is expected to decline 3m tonnes to 89m tonnes. The IWC has also revised downwards its forecast for 1993 wheat production to 564m tonnes from last month's 566m tonnes.</p>

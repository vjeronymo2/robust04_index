			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Stable Relations in Luxembourg -- </F> No Surprises at the Elections"]    [Text] The "Hei Elei" [Luxembourg Television] factor  unintentionally produced an exciting election yesterday.    According to initial projections that were circulated in the  early afternoon, the LSAP [Socialist Workers' Party of  Luxembourg] was to suffer a crushing defeat and the DP  [Democratic Party] was to record a landslide gain.    The sober verdict of the electorate was quite different.  Both the CSV [Christian Social People's Party] and the LSAP  suffered slight losses throughout the country, which cost the  two governing parties one seat each, but the Liberals did not  achieve the breakthrough they had hoped for--they merely  consolidated their 12th seat, which Josy Simon's defection had  already secured for them a year ago.    The "Greens" turned gray out of sheer disappointment when  they received only five instead of the 10 to 11 seats they had  hoped for.    The Communist Party and New Left were cast into the  political  wilderness where they join the National Movement. The ADR  [Action Committee for Democracy and Pension Fairness], with its  populist pension claims, achieved a reasonable success which the  next government ought to build on in order to deal with this  important question of basic justice.    Otherwise, it was a quiet election day in Luxembourg, one  which caused the international agencies, in view of the  perceived stability, to forecast a continuation of the present  coalition. We must wait and see.  <H5>  [Box, p 1] </H5>   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Distribution of Seats                                                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Political party          |Seats received           |Change                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |CSV                      |21                       |- 1                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |LSAP                     |17                       |- 1                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |DP                       |12                       |+ 1                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |ADR                      |5                        |+                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Green Party              |5                        |+ 1                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

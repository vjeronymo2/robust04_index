			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Warning of anti-science threat: British Association for the Advancement of Science GROWING anti-science feelings and even 'bio-angst' are threatening government support for science in the UK, Sir David Weatherall, incoming association president, warned, Clive Cookson writes. Sir David, honorary director of the Institute of Molecular Medicine, Oxford, said: 'In the medical sciences, it's partly a feeling that we're meddling with the real basics of life. But it's broader than that, a more general disillusion with high technology.' Scientists were responsible for some of the disenchantment, because they had promoted a 'breakthrough-a-week' mentality. 'The broader effects are harmful because they feed back to government.' He agreed with evidence produced at the meeting that British science was in decline. In the case of clinical medicine, 'university departments in the UK are too small to be able to use all the advantages of modern science'. Private View, Weekend XVIII</p>

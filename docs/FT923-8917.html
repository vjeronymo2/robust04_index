			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Wholesale Fittings cuts final WHOLESALE Fittings, distributor of electrical goods, is cutting its final dividend from 13.39p to 8.47p as pre-tax profits for the year ended April 30 1992 dropped from Pounds 4.26m to Pounds 2.51m. This gives a total dividend for the year of 11.7p, a decrease of 29.6 per cent and representing the whole of the earnings per share. Last year the payment was 16.62p from earnings of 19.7p. Mr Dennis Rose, chairman, said the group's financial position must be maintained and improved, and it would not be appropriate to pay a dividend in excess of earnings. Sales slipped to Pounds 62.2m (Pounds 63.3m) and the chairman believed that was a creditable performance, particularly as the high rate of business failures had meant introducing an even firmer policy of vetting potential customers. Trading margins remained under pressure - operating profit fell to Pounds 2.21m (Pounds 4.24m) - and bad debts were abnormally high.</p>

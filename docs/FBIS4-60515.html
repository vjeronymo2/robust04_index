			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Rashid: "Abu-'Ammar's </F> Jihad!!"]    [Excerpts] Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin is very  angry because Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat has declared  jihad against the Israelis from South Africa. We wish to  reassure him here that 'Arafat's jihad call will not achieve for  him more than he can achieve at the negotiating table.  Abu-'Ammar ['Arafat] did not achieve much when he was calling  for jihad just a few miles away from Palestine, let alone doing  that from Johannesburg at the far end of Africa. [passage  omitted]    In the view of the majority, jihad is no longer jihad  because  most battles are between brothers, for personal vendettas, or  foreign battles fought on Islamic territory. With the weakening  of the leadership and its credibility, the word jihad has become  weaker. Rabin, therefore, should rest assured that Abu-'Ammar's  call will not move the people of South Africa, just as it did  not move others.    The real jihad was that of the unarmed people who risked  their lives to target the head of an Israeli soldier with their  stones. What came before was just military operations by regular  armies.    Even the other organizations which declare jihad in the name  of Islam, have two problems. The first is that, like  Abu-'Ammar, they make the call from distant places like Tehran,  and the second is that they declare jihad as a part of the same  organization which brings them together with communist groups at  the same table. They cannot carry out their jihad from a place  a thousand miles away nor can they call what they are doing  jihad when they seek the assistance of communists.</p>

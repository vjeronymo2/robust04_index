			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Inflation in France at 0.1% in November French retail prices were virtually static last month with a rise of just 0.1 per cent, according to Insee, the state statistics institute. The figures partly reflected the sluggish state of the French economy. The negligible rise in November's prices means that French retail price inflation has risen by a modest 2.2 per cent since the start of this year. The retail sector has come under intense strain and manufacturers in some sectors, notably food and clothing, have been forced to cut prices. The price of private sector manufactured goods fell 0.2 per cent last month, according to Insee, mainly due to the cut in clothing prices. But the cost of unseasonal perishable products, notably fresh fruit and vegetables, rose sharply. Strains on the consumer sector were underlined by publication of a Paris Chamber of Commerce and Industry study showing that retail sales fell in November compared with October. Hypermarkets and supermarkets were worst affected, with department stores mustering a slight rise. However, the French franc strengthened again on further evidence of the impact of France's economic rigour. The franc, which recently returned to its old European exchange rate mechanism trading bands for the first time since the summer currency crisis, rose to FFr3.4063 against the D-Mark from FFr3.4079.</p>

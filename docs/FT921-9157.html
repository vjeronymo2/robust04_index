			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Sweden loses its fear of capital inflow - A surge of foreign money has helped close the investment gap FOR so long a net exporter of capital, Sweden has suddenly become the focus for a dramatic inflow of foreign investment which promises over time to change the face of the country's corporate ownership. The country's central bank is expected to reveal early next week that around SKr50bn (Pounds 4.8bn) of foreign investment flowed into Sweden during 1991. This contrasts with only SKr13.8bn in the previous year and a mere SKr9.7bn in 1989. During the whole of the 1980s the volume of Swedish investment flowing overseas was six times larger than the amount of investment coming into the country. The closing of the investment gap, from SKr75bn at the end of 1990 to SKr14m for the last year, reflects partly the slowdown in the Swedish investment offensive abroad that grew so fast between 1987 and 1990, especially through mergers and acquisitions in the European Community. But the substantial increase in inward investment volume also indicates just how attractive Sweden is becoming for investment opportunities in the eyes of a growing number of foreign companies. The country's leading business magazine, Affarsvarlden, calculated recently that inward investment rose by 400 per cent last year while the number of Swedes employed by foreign-owned companies tripled. An estimated 135 Swedish companies employing 40,000 workers were bought by foreign concerns over the past three years. Sweden has witnessed some significant acquisitions by foreign companies. These include the purchase of Nobel Industry's consumer goods division by the German chemical group, Henkel; the take-over of Inter Innovation by its rival in security printing and payment machines De La Rue, the UK company; the acquisition by the Danish company ISS-International Service Systems of Electrolux's commercial cleaning services; and the purchase of Boliden Kemi by the Finnish company, Kemira Oy. In addition, corporate Sweden has seen the growth of joint ventures and strategic alliances between domestic and foreign companies. The most notable have been the 50 per cent stake in Saab Auto taken by General Motors, Volvo's complex partnership with Renault, Gillette and JP Morgan's 47.8 per cent acquisition of Swedish Match, and the Norwegian company Freia's 49.6 per cent purchase of Marabou chocolate. Swedish company shares are now more appealing for foreigners, an interest in buying helped directly by the abolition in December of the turnover tax on share dealing on the Stockholm bourse. Foreigners, at the end of 1991, held 8.1 per cent of the SKr552bn-worth of shares on the local stock market and it has been estimated that foreigners accounted for the purchase of between SKr15bn-20bn shares during last year. In 1992, Sweden's shareholders' association has estimated that up to SKr30bn more Swedish corporate stock could be bought by foreigners. The surge in foreign business interest in Sweden stems from a number of inter-related factors as the economy has become more deregulated and international. The most important positive change has been Sweden's commitment to join the EC by 1995, coupled with the promise of financial stability through the pegging of the krona to the European Currency Unit, firm control of monetary policy using high interest rates if necessary, measures to cut costs, keeping inflation down to average EC levels, and improving productivity. The country's non-Socialist coalition which came to power last October has speeded up liberalisation with a robust free market strategy. As many as 35 of the country's state-controlled companies are to be privatised. Old laws restricting foreign companies are also being scrapped. Last month, the government made it easier for them to buy shares and real estate by abolishing a law dating back to 1916 which required non-Swedes to obtain permission from the public authorities to acquire voting shares or equity every time the purchase exceeded or was increased by 10 per cent of a company's stock. More reform is in the pipeline.</p>

			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Hurd floats possibility of EU referendum Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, floated the possibility of a referendum on further European integration yesterday as rightwing Tory MPs claimed they had been threatened with deselection if they vote against the EU finance bill. Amid an increasingly bitter battle over Monday's crucial second reading vote on the bill, ministers said there was no prospect of a general election or a successful rightwing challenge to Mr John Major's leadership of the Tory party. Frenzied head counting at Westminster, indicated that 18 Tory backbenchers - just enough to block the EU finance bill - had signed a rebel motion giving the Commons public accounts committee power to block UK contributions to the EU budget. And in a development certain to inflame Eurosceptic anger, Mr Hans van den Broek, EU commissioner for external political affairs, called for a new constitutional deal to end the UK's right to veto further integration. Mr van den Broek said that four-fifths of the EU's population and member states should have the right to over-ride national vetos, challenging the 36-year-old principle that treaty changes must have unanimous support. Mr Hurd's admission that a referendum on further EU integration had not been ruled out was seen as an attempt to defuse the European issue by suggesting that voters may have the final say. Mr Hurd said he was 'temperamentally opposed' to referendums, but only parliament could decide whether to hold one. 'It is a great mistake to say never in this world and you will see I am not saying never,' he told BBC radio. Downing Street said the prime minister remained 'sceptical' about referendums, but did not rule out the idea. A pledge of tough action against EU fraud will form the centrepiece of the government's defence of the finance bill. Potential rebels said they were coming under intense pressure to fall into line before the vote. Mrs Teresa Gorman, MP for Billericay, said that Conservative central office had threatened to disband her constituency party and install another candidate if it refused to deselect her. Central office said the party's voluntary area chairmen had simply explained the party's rules to the constituencies. Underlining the government's nervousness, Mr Michael Howard, the rightwing home secretary, warned that the party needed 'unity and discipline.' The Crown Prosecution Service yesterday cleared Mr Mohamad Fayed, the owner of Harrods, of allegations that he tried to blackmail the prime minister by threatening to disclose impropriety by ministers. Mr Fayed said he was 'totally vindicated' and demanded an apology from Mr Major. Downing Street said there was 'no question' of an apology.

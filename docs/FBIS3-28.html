			<p>SUMMARY                                          Apparently seeing little merit in a policy of open confrontation  with the Chinese over human rights issues and at the same time  eager to secure a share of China's burgeoning market, Germany and  France have avoided all but the most muted public criticism of  China's human rights record while steadily expanding diplomatic  and trade contacts.  German and French media, while supportive of  improved relations with China, have expressed doubts about the  wisdom of sof t-pedaling the human rights issue and yielding to  China's demand to stop selling arms to Taiwan.                                       END SUMMARY     In marked contrast to recent U.S. policy, both Germany and France  have chosen a low-key approach to the issue of Chinese human  rights violations, arguing that it is more effective to promote  democratic development through strengthened economic relations  than through public admonitions.  Germany's efforts, including  lifting sanctions against China and yielding to China's  insistence that it not sell submarines to Taiwan, culminated in  Chancellor Helmut Kohl's trip to China in November 1993 and the  signing of several large contracts.  Similarly, following months  of diplomatic efforts to repair a rift in relations triggered by  France's sale of Mirage airplanes to Taiwan in November 1992,  France and China "normalized" relations on 12 January.  In return  for two key French concessions--recognition of the PRC Government  as the "sole legal government of China" and Taiwan as an  "integral part of Chinese territory" and agreement "not to  authorize" any French enterprises to sell arms to Taiwan--China  agreed to welcome participation by French firms in China "on an  equal footing," according to a joint communique (Xinhua, 12  January).     Germany's "Quiet Diplomacy"     German leaders have repeatedly defended the government's policy  of not pressuring the Chinese publicly on human rights and  instead promoting change through economic relations and "behind-  the-scenes" efforts.  Both Kohl and Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel  have stressed that Germany's approach on Chinese human rights is  to use quiet diplomacy and to promote progress on human rights  and democracy in China through trade and economic reform:     --Even after the recent roundup of Chinese dissidents, the German  reaction was limited to an expression of "concern" over the  arrests, and a caution issued by a foreign ministry spokesman  that the arrests could "clearly disturb" German-Chinese  relations.  Indicating that even in this case the usual German  nonpublic diplomacy was being followed, the spokesman said Berlin  had "approached" Beijing on this matter the previous week (DPA, 8  March).     --Explaining Germany's approach to the human rights issue, Kinkel  told German ambassadors to Asia on 26 January that "wagging an  admonishing finger" at the Chinese would not be productive,  because Europeans cannot "impose" their cultural principles on  the Asian countries.  "Dignity," so important in Asia, he said,  had to be respected.  He argued that instead of public  confrontation, it would be more effective to be "secretly active"  to help in concrete cases of human rights violations (Frankfurter  Rundschau, 27 January).  Apparently with the United States in  mind, Kinkel contrasted Germany's approach to those who "bang  their fists on the table," and declared that the West "cannot  enforce everything" with pressure on the leadership (Das  Parlament, 24-31 December 1993).     --During his trip to China, Kohl defended his approach on human  rights, saying that he had had an "intensive talk on human  rights" with China's leaders but that it was "not a subject" for  public discussion (N-TV, 19 November 1993). "History has shown,"  he argued in another interview, that "freedom leads to more  freedom" and that free economic development "has an impact on  human rights and the freedom of the citizens" (ARD, 19 November  1993).     German Press Questions Policy     Until the arrest of Chinese dissidents in early March, media  reaction had been largely supportive of the Government's trade  initiatives in China and its low-key approach to the human rights  issue.  The Munich daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung even said in a 25  January commentary that Kohl and Kinkel's efforts on human rights  could "serve as a model" for dealing with China, because they  demonstrated that "value-oriented" foreign policy does "not have  to be an exercise in finger-pointing."  Since the largescale  arrests, however, the press has questioned this policy,  criticizing both Germany and the United States for acceding to  China's demands and suggesting that the West's approach is giving  Beijing every reason to believe that the West will do nothing to  jeopardize trade relations:     --Following the arrest of prominent Chinese dissidents in early  March, the influential daily Frankfurter Allgemeine on 5 March  said the Chinese Government had shown what it thought of Western  criticism:  namely, "nothing."  "For the sake of economic  interests" the West will continue to turn a "blind eye" to the  political suppression in China and even more so in Tibet, because  the Chinese market is "too enticing."  Europe's argument that the  "closer the economic ties," the greater the chances for  "political loosening up," has proved "illusionary."     --On 17 February, Frankfurter Allgemeine chastized the German  Government for the "shameful" way in which the city of Frankfurt  had officially "invited and then uninvited" the Tibetan Dalai  Lama to a celebration of Frankfurt's 1,200th anniversary, calling  the move an "unnecessary kowtow" and an "undignified retreat" in  the face of China's unreasonable demands.     --The left-of-center Frankfurter Rundschau of 5 March said that  "just as during Kohl's trip" to China, Beijing seems to have come  to the conclusion that "all western admonitions" on human rights  are meant "halfheartedly."     France Pleased     In announcing renewed relations with China, Foreign Minister  Alain Juppe avoided any mention of human rights issues, while  saying that the "political weight of China and its economic  power" justified France's decision to "resume the ties of trust."  He expressed hope that this could be brought about through an  "intense political dialogue with Beijing" and "strengthening of  economic relations" (France-Inter Radio, 12 January).     Although they avoided pressing the Chinese on the issue, French  leaders apparently did mention human rights in subsequent  meetings with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen.  Following a  meeting with Qian in Paris on 22 January, Juppe spoke of a "new  departure" in relations with China, saying that he had addressed  the issue of human rights with Qian and that "a lot must still be  done" by China in that area (AFP, 22 January).  France's special  envoy to China Alain Peyrefitte addressed the issue "with great  subtlety" according to Le Figaro of 31 January, when he said at  dinner with Qian in China that France, while it was unwilling to  "impinge on a sovereign state's internal affairs," could "not be  insensitive to matters relating to the respect of individual and  group freedoms."     Skeptical French Press     The French press has criticized the government's failure to press  the human rights issue, and has largely been skeptical of  prospects for significantly improved trade relations.  Several  commentaries attacked the government for yielding to China's  demands on Taiwan and expressed pique at what they viewed as  China's favoritism toward the United States, which they saw as  having maintained relations with Taiwan without incurring Chinese  retribution.     --The influential daily Le Monde was particularly skeptical.  An  editorial on 14 January expressed doubt about the terms of the  joint communique, saying that the Chinese have shown "how little  regard" they attach to their promises of trade advantages.  As  for human rights, it charged, Beijing is "convinced that  'hypocritical' Western concerns for human rights" will eventually  be superseded by greed.  On 25 January, Le Monde wrote  sardonically that normalization of relations with China indeed  represented a "new departure," since "commercial interests" had  now "displaced the memory of the Tiananmen massacre," which the  French government at the time had denounced with a determination  "unmatched throughout the world."     --A commentary published in Liberation of 16 February charged the  French Government with "obsequiousness" and "grovelling" toward  Beijing in pledging not to sell weapons to Taiwan.  China's  rulers "do not respect the rules" accepted by the international  community with regard to human rights, weapons sales, or external  trade, the commentary said, noting that the United States  remained the "only country that still dares to say no to China"  (Liberation, 16 February).

			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Trade on a cliff edge RARELY, if ever, can the principal trade negotiator of the European Community have visited Washington at a more delicate time. For where the Bush administration was at least shame-faced about its unilateralism in trade policy, the Clinton administration appears bare-faced. Sir Leon Brittan - like Mr Michio Watanabe, the Japanese foreign minister, who will be in Washington at the same time - needs to remind the US administration of the serious risks it runs. Mr Mickey Kantor, the new US trade representative, has said that 'the days when we could afford to subordinate our economic interests to foreign policy or defence concerns are long past'. This credo is not even controversial in US policy-making circles any more. It is nonsense, all the same. The trading policies pursued by the US in the postwar era did not subordinate US economic interests to those other objectives. On the contrary, the postwar economic recovery of Europe and Japan greatly expanded the opportunities facing US producers, just as it did the opportunities enjoyed by US consumers. This Mr Kantor seems to ignore. What he seems to mean by 'our economic interests' are the interests of particular US industries. The cue has already been followed by the automobile industry, with a long list of others right behind it. What is needed, they all argue, is a 'level playing field'. Moreover, the US has, they also assume, the right both to survey and then bulldoze its partners' terrain. The possibility that the US playing field might not be level either seems not to occur. Yet US anti-dumping policy, US tariff peaks and US-imposed voluntary export restraints are just a few of the ways that it too distorts trade. Export volumes The administration should consider a few facts. Despite obstacles abroad, the volume of US exports expanded by 74 per cent between 1985 and the first quarter of 1992, while German exports rose by 28 per cent and those of Japan by less than 20 per cent. Moreover, trade policy has been liberalising worldwide. The trade policies of the EC, for example, are highly imperfect. Yet the net effect of the single market programme - not least in the contested area of public procurement - has been to increase opportunities for foreign companies, for US ones not least. The EC has not been alone. Japan's trade policies have moved steadily in a liberalising direction, while 63 countries have notified the Gatt of unilateral trade liberalisation since the start of the Uruguay Round. Not since the early years of this century can US producers have faced a more open world market. Nor can there ever have been such worldwide acceptance of what US policy-makers have been arguing for so many decades. Yet the US seems no longer to be particularly interested. On the fundamental question of whether and how to complete the Uruguay Round - hardly an unexpected one, after all - it vouchsafes no clear answer. Dangers of conflict The administration may believe that no great harm need be done by the worsening of trade relations. If so, it is likely to be proved wrong. One of the main reasons that the EC felt obliged to settle the oilseeds dispute, despite French resistance, was the fact that it had been taken to the Gatt twice, and lost. More broadly, trade conflict is bound to make global economic co-operation more difficult, while failure to complete the Uruguay round would impair fragile global confidence and worsen already weakening US export prospects. Moreover, the administration should not assume there will be no retaliation. President Mitterrand has already said that the EC must respond to protectionist measures with 'protectionism and a half'. Sir Leon must try to lift the discussion above the particular disputes between the US and EC, even above the immediate fate of the Uruguay Round. He needs to remind Mr Kantor what is at stake. He should show himself accommodating where the US has a case, but firm where it does not. Above all, he should stress that unilateralism will not remain the prerogative of the US alone. Ultimately, Sir Leon's interlocutor is Mr Clinton. The president needs to be asked how far he is prepared to risk what his predecessors achieved over half a century. The world waits for his answer.</p>

			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Rally in bond market lifts Japan's leading brokers A RALLY in the bond market and a recovery in stock prices helped Japan's leading brokers to report stronger performances for the first six months to September. However, the figures were lower than previously anticipated for most brokers, due to weaker-than-expected commissions on the Tokyo stock market, where the daily average turnover has been 10 per cent lower than initial projections. While the big four houses - Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko and Yamaichi - saw a return to profitability from a year ago, six of the 10 second-tier brokers remained in the red. The Nikkei index, which hit a six-year low in August last year, recovered to the 20,000 level last April. Daily trading value rose by 58 per cent to Y407.6bn (Dollars 3.8bn) from a year ago, but activity has been dominated by large institutional investors, and some smaller brokers, which are dependent on retail investors, failed to benefit from the increase. Of the 14 largest brokers, Daiwa saw the largest pre-tax profit, due to a 56.5 per cent rise in commissions to Y110.5bn. Daiwa posted a nine-fold rise in stock underwriting commission income to Y2.6bn due to income from DDI, a long-distance telecommunications company, and Taito, a game maker, both popular among investors. Nomura's commission income rose 48.2 per cent to Y140.4bn, while underwriting commission income rose 71.5 per cent to Y17.3bn due to an increase in convertible bond issues. However, its profit in the balance on financial times shrank 26.8 per cent to Y34.5bn due to lower interest rates. Nikko's commission income rose 58.7 per cent to Y105.3bn, while stock underwriting commission income increased seven fold to Y3bn. However, Nikko was the only broker among the big four to see an increase in expenses, as sales and administrative expenses rose by 8.1 per cent to Y116.3bn. Yamaichi posted a 44.4 per cent rise in commission income to Y88.7bn, while stock underwriting tripled to Y803m. Many of the smaller brokers are still struggling under the burden of over-expansion during the late 1980s. Of the 10 second-tier brokers, New Japan, Wako, Tokyo, and Kokusai managed to post pre-tax profits, while Sanyo, Kankaku, Yamatane, Okasan, Cosmo, and Dai-Ichi posted losses. Industry analysts feel the worst is over for the larger brokers, but point out they will need to undergo further cost cuts to improve profitability. For the full year, Nomura expects a 30-fold jump in pre-tax profits to Y70bn, while Nikko forecasts pre-tax profits to rise six fold to Y40bn. Daiwa, which saw losses last fiscal year, expects a pre-tax profit of Y60bn while Yamaichi predicts pre-tax profits of Y22bn.  -------------------------------------------------------------------- JAPANESE SECURITIES HOUSES  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Interim results to September 1993  --------------------------------------------------------------------              Sales      Change % on   Pre-tax profit   Pre-tax profit             Y (bn)     1992 interim       Y (bn)         1992 interim  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Nomura       202.0         +13.1           25.3             0.983 Daiwa        158.3         +18.9           35.3             1.871 Nikko        137.4         +15.8           12.9             0.048 Yamaichi     121.0         +24.1           11.3           -19.317  --------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

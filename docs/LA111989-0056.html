			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: HEADED UPSTREAM INTERVIEWS WITH ICONOCLASTS BY JACK  LOEFFLER (HARBINGER HOUSE: $10.95, ILLUSTRATED)  </P> <P> The writers, film makers and social activists in these brief profiles are not  randomly chosen free thinkers but people with unconventional approaches to  ecological issues and questions of Native American rights, particularly the  dispute over the development of the Black Mesa region of New Mexico. Their  opinions range from rather conventional liberalism to fuzzy-minded romanticism.  Dave Foreman offers the untenable assertion that the existence of primitive  hunter-gatherers was "the best life people ever lived." (To paraphrase Tom  Lehrer, "By the time the average hunter-gatherer reached Foreman's age, he was  already dead.") In contrast, historian Alvin Josephy and former Secretary of  the Interior Stewart Udall offer more thoughtful reflections on the issue of  nuclear power and the conflict between traditional Amerindian beliefs and  Western culture. "Headed Upstream" raises many interesting questions;  unfortunately, most of the answers it offers are simplistic and superficial.  </P></p>

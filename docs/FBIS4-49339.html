			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Jason Gagliardi] </F>   [Text] A family of five North Korean defectors spent  almost two weeks in Hong Kong after an arduous journey across  China before flying to a new life in Seoul at the weekend.    Ryo Man Chol, 48, a former police officer from Hamhung  province, his wife and three children, were kept at a secret  location in Hong Kong while applying for political asylum in  South Korea.    The South Korean consulate is refusing to release details of  where the family stayed in Hong Kong and it is not known how  they managed to elude Chinese authorities for weeks while  travelling by train from northern China to Hong Kong.    The Hong Kong government is not commenting on the Ryo  family's ordeal, fearing that they could be the first trickle in  a potential flood of refugees from hardship-stricken North Korea  entering the territory via China.    A Security Branch spokesman said: "We cannot give out  information on this sort of case because it is very sensitive  and involves other countries."    The spokesman refused to detail how the Ryo family entered  Hong Kong, saying the Government did not want to publicise how  it was done for fear of encouraging other defectors -- including  thousands already thought to be living in China -- to make Hong  Kong a pipeline to a fresh start in South Korea.    At a press conference in Seoul yesterday, the Ryo family  told  of how they decided it was better to risk being killed while  escaping than face slow starvation at home.    A spokesman for South Korea's National Security Planning  Agency told Eastern Express that agency officers had spent the  past two days questioning the Ryos to establish that they were  genuine defectors and not spies.    Ryo said an ethnic Korean named Kim who helped them on  arriving in China first suggested they go for help to the South  Korean embassy in Beijing.    Deciding Beijing was too dangerous they fled into northern  China across the frozen Yalu River and went to Shenyang, where  they met Kim, before moving south by train.    Ryo, who said he was sacked from the police force for taking  a bribe over a traffic violation, had been listening to banned  South Korean broadcasts for several months before deciding to  defect.    The family decided to steal across the river on the pretext  of gathering food. Ryo's daughter Gum Ju, 20, and one of his  sons, Gum Ryong, 18, went first to make sure the ice would hold.  They made it and on March 16, sent a telegram saying all was  well. Ryo, his wife, Li Ok Gum, 45, and their other son, Un  Ryong, 16, followed.    Li, 45, a kindergarten teacher, cried as she told how her  family had been forced to subsist on corn and pine-bark porridge  since last August, when food rations ran out.    "We were so hungry that I had to go to the countryside and  beg for grains," she said.    Ryo said revolution was imminent because the Kim Il Sung  regime was unable to feed its people.    His account matches the tales of other northern defectors  but  has met with scepticism from some analysts in Seoul, who say the  South has its own propaganda agenda.    Visitors to Pyongyang say they have not noticed food  shortages. However, its government has admitted to "economic  problems".</p>

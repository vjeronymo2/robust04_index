			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Management: Regimental ties in Civvy Street / A look at officers becoming city gents Business metaphors such as 'takeover battle' and 'dawn raid' are coming into their own as officers leaving Britain's armed forces seek new careers in management and finance. This year, the Army is shedding 850 officers in the first tranche of the Options for Change forces cut-back programme, and over the following two years a further 1,500 or so will go. Smaller numbers - not yet announced - will leave the Royal Navy and RAF. The Ministry of Defence is helping ease the transition of soldiers, sailors and airmen into the civilian sectors with special courses on subjects like business management. Private sector consultancies are starting to get in on the act. Coutts Career Consultants has been awarded an MoD contract to counsel departing personnel. It will be starting workshops in Germany and in the garrisons of Aldershot, Hampshire, and Catterick, North Yorkshire from April 1. Right Associates, the outplacement group which runs job assistance centres for the US Army, is offering free advice on second careers to a senior officer from each of the three British services as a promotional gambit. The idea is that the officers will give the agency tips on how to tailor its advice, and will also recommend it to fellow officers. David Burden, director-general, resettlement, at the MoD, says 60 per cent those leaving the forces voluntarily or through redundancy get other jobs immediately. They go into banking, education, engineering, the National Health Service - indeed to every civilian sector. At the end of six months, the success rate is 85 per cent. The most obvious selling point for those who have held command in the armed forces is leadership. But how well does military leadership operate when it changes to mufti? Well enough to have persuaded 300 Dutch executives to pay up to FL3,000 (Pounds 925) each in December to hear Norman Schwarzkopf, the Desert Storm commander, lecture on the lessons of the Gulf war. Schwarzkopf contended that both military and civilian leaders must have the courage to make decisions based on insufficient information. Military training also equips people to respond properly to new data. 'Clever sailors are among the most adaptable of people,' says Michael Robinson, personnel director for Henderson Administration Group, the City investment managers. He left the Royal Navy in 1986 with the rank of commander, having been the captain of patrol craft in the Far East. According to Brian Lees, a former head of technical intelligence for the Army: 'Flexible is the first thing officers must be, because if you can't change your plan based on new information, you are sunk.' Lees is now a consultant for Lehman Brothers International, the investment bank, specialising in joint ventures in the Arab world. The relevance of his view to business is clear. In an age of 'managing change', who adapts wins. Officers are trained to be good at logic, hard intelligence and sorting out data. But according to Roderick Macdonald, a serving British brigadier, the best are also aware of when a situation does not 'feel' right. In the civilian sphere, the ability to be both analytical and intuitive should help to break the tyranny of experts, he says. The recommendations of, say, outside management consultants, should be viewed not as solutions to implement, but as adjuncts to what the executive knows of his own organisation. So, will the flexible and intuitive, yet analytical, ex-services person find a smooth path into management? Not necessarily. There are things the military does not teach you. For Joe Ruston, one of these things was how to negotiate with employees over pay and working conditions. In the Royal Navy, in which he served for 13 years, 'you never discussed with a sailor what he was paid, and conditions are laid down in the Queen's Regulations'. As chairman of Mander Portman Woodward, a London tutorial college, Ruston recalls how in 1981 he 'got into a seriously bad mess' over a disagreement with his staff. The Inland Revenue had pressed the college to take the teachers, then self-employed, into the Pay As You Earn income-tax net. After a fight with the tax-man, the college gave in, only to be faced with two months of industrial action by unhappy staff. 'I felt betrayed,' says Ruston. 'I'd probably been too paternalistic, but I had looked after them and now they were giving me a hard time. I think I was applying a service attitude. 'I hadn't cottoned on to the financial side of man-management. When I wanted to tighten the screws, I couldn't do it. 'I reacted wrongly and my service training hadn't prepared me for that at all.' Eventually, the dispute was resolved to the satisfaction of both sides. Advance clues about how former military people may react to certain types of situations could, therefore, be useful - to them and their new organisations. Richard Sale, a Cyprus-based staff officer, has attempted to put his finger on characteristic military qualities by using the techniques of psychometric testing - the assessment of personality traits according to a fixed set of criteria. In a paper for the Royal Military College of Science and Cranfield Institute of Technology, he collated the responses of 49 brigadiers to computer tests and questionnaires. The officers who were tested - 80 per cent of the brigade commanders in the Army in 1990 - were found, on balance, to be sociable, energetic and goal-centred individuals who liked solving difficult problems, 'sometimes ingeniously'. They were flexible planners, sought variety and change and were consequently easily bored. Outgoing in nature, they were confident with new contacts. At the same time, the subjects' profiles suggested that they could seem domineering to independent staff and lack tact at times. Their very ebullience did not fit them for a quiet, low stimulus environment. And they 'may struggle with a role that demands a high concern for detail'. Sale concludes that officers transfer easily to the civilian sector, and they are particularly well suited for senior executive positions in sales and marketing. For all of that, it would be surprising if many job-changers did not experience a clash of cultures. Some will, for the first time, be working with women as equals. Others may need to get used to a less hierarchical management structure in which the trappings of achievement are harder to discern than they are in the armed forces. Unlike Alexander, today's paladin does have new worlds to conquer.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Comrat, BASAPRESS, 6/6/1994 -- Turkish President  Suleyman Demirel's visit to Comrat and Ceadar-Lunga districts is  of historic importance. He was the first Turkish president to  visit the region inhabited by Gagauzians, stated to BASA Stepan  Topal, president of the self-proclaimed Gagauz Republic.  According to him, "this visit will strongly foster Gagauzians'  national rebirth in many areas as well as the parliamentary  settlement of the problem regarding Gagauzians'  self-determination." The credit worth $32 million, which Turkey  granted Moldova to develop the Southern districts will  accelerate the social-economic development of these districts,  said Topal.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive report" by Janine Lazarus] </F>   [Text] Members of the National Intelligence Service [NIS]  might be linked to Eskom's sale of arms to the kwaZulu Police.  On March 25, the day the parastatal announced it had uncovered  and cancelled plans to sell 1,000 semi-automatic rifles to an  arms dealer for resale to the kwaZulu Police, 10 weapons were  signed out of Eskom's arsenal and loaded into a truck parked  outside Eskom's Megawatt Park headquarters. A source within  Eskom said the truck was accompanied by a number of other  vehicles, including a grey Mercedes-Benz bearing the  registration NVB131T. Senior police sources said this week that  the Mercedes was registered in the name of the NIS at a Skinner  Street, Pretoria, address.    According to official Eskom documents in WEEKEND STAR's  possession, two transactions for the removal of 20 LM-4  semi-automatic rifles to an unknown destination took place two  weeks ago. The weapons were apparently checked out to a  "bearer". WEEKEND STAR knows the identity of the "bearer", but  for legal reasons cannot name the person.    Eskom officials insist that the "bearer" is not one of their  employees. A form authorising removal from Eskom stores was  signed by Eskom manager Johan van der Walt, who, with Eskom  security head Floris Bonthuys, was suspended last week after the  utility investigated the weapons deal. The weapons then  mysteriously returned to the stores.    Repeated attempts to find out from the NIS, Eskom and the  State President's office failed to establish what an NIS vehicle  was doing at Eskom, the identity of the "bearer" who signed for  the weapons, and why further weapons were being sold after Eskom  had publicly undertaken not to sell arms.    An NIS spokesman, who refused to be named, denied that his  organisation was linked to any arms deal between Eskom and the  kwaZulu Police. "There is no question whatsoever that we could  be involved there. We do have contact from time to time. It's  formal liaison -- just a question of talking about what things  are like. Then we drive to the front door."    The spokesman at first refused to take down the  Mercedes-Benz's registration details, but then agreed to check  the information. He called back later to say the information  was wrong, and attempted to support this by quoting a different  registration number, which he said belonged to a BMW registered  to a financial house in Orkney. He laughed when he was told the  information had been gleaned from reliable police sources. "And  you trust them?" he asked.    The police sources double-checked their information and  confirmed that the registration number noted at Megawatt Park at  the time of the arms deal belonged to the NIS.    An Eskom spokesman, given the name of the mysterious  "bearer"  and asked who he was, said the only people who would know were  the two suspended Eskom employees who set up the weapons deal.  "And is it fair to worry them after they have been suspended?"  he asked.    Late last Thursday Eskom's public affairs senior general  manager Bongani Khumalo promised he would come up with some  answers. After arranging a meeting last Friday to clear things  up, he referred WEEKEND STAR to Eskom's acting chief executive,  Dr George Lindeque. "We've designated him spokesman on this."  However, Lindeque was not prepared to clear up the mystery  surrounding the NIS vehicle. "We have appointed an  investigative committee," he said. I can't pre-empt any finding  right now and it would not be right to comment on any of the  findings. We are going to go public on all the findings."    Richard Carter, President's Office communications department  director, said his office was "grateful" for the information  provided, but said it was "impossible" to make any comment. "I  will pass it on to the people concerned," he said, and referred  WEEKEND STAR to the NIS -- which was, after all, where we had  started.</p>

			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Cable News Network has silenced its "unchallenged commentaries" but will  continue to air commentaries and their opposing views on such programs as  "Crossfire," "Evans &amp; Novak" and the "Capitol Gang." A spokesman at CNN  headquarters in Atlanta said "it was just a management decision" to end the  free-standing commentaries of Linda Ellerbee, Robert Novak, Marty Schramm,  weatherman Flip Spiceland and sportscaster Jim Huber. All of the commentators  except Ellerbee do other work for CNN. Among the network evening newscasts,  only NBC still regularly airs commentary by John Chancellor. George Will  comments for ABC News on an irregular basis. CBS discontinued commentaries  after Bill Moyers, who delivered them, quit in 1986 and returned to public TV.  ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

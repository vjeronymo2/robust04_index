The clause is a modification of that currently in use. The modifications clarify the clause's applicability, reduce contractor reporting requirements and eliminate MAS price reductions based on a low price to an individual Federal agency. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments are due in writing on or before April 25, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments should be addressed to the GSA Desk Officer, room 3235, NEOB, Washington, DC 20503 and Marjorie Ashby, Office of GSA Acquisition Policy, 18th and F Streets, NW., room 4006, Washington, DC 20405. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </ADDRESS> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Ida M.

Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> On June 14, 1993, GSA solicited comments (58 FR 32890) on proposed changes to the current MAS Price Reductions clause. The proposed clause would have eliminated certain reporting requirements and increased the time given contractors to notify the Government of price reductions. Public comments received generally supported the changes, but felt that further changes should be made to reduce the burden on MAS contractors. To address these comments GSA proposes to further revise the clause to require that the Government be extended price reductions under the same terms and with the same effective dates which the contractor extends to commercial customers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The National Performance Review recommended that line managers be given greater flexibility to buy the same or comparable MAS products for less. In order to remove any disincentive to MAS contractors offering agencies a lower price on individual orders, GSA proposes to eliminate paragraph (c) of the current clause entitled ``Price Reductions to Federal Agencies.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> B. Executive Order 12866 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> This rule was submitted to and approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in accordance with Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> C. Regulatory Flexibility Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> An initial regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared and submitted to the Acting Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration. Copies of the initial regulatory flexibility analysis are available from the office identified above. The initial regulatory flexibility analysis indicates that the proposed rule will affect contractors, including small businesses, that are awarded contracts under GSA's MAS program. Historically, approximately seventy percent of MAS contractors have been small businesses. Based on the number of MAS contracts currently in effect, it is estimated that 4,288 small businesses will be impacted by the new rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> D. Paperwork Reduction Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The Price Reductions clause is an information collection subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and has been submitted to OMB for approval under the Act. Comments on the information collection requirements may be submitted to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of OMB, Attention: Desk Officer for GSA, Washington, DC 20503. The title of the information collection is ``GSAR 552.238&hyph;75 Price Reductions.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Price Reductions clause is intended to ensure that the Government maintains its price/discount (and/or term and condition) advantage in relation to the contractor's commercial customer(s) upon which the MAS contract is predicated. The customer or category of customer upon which the award is predicated is identified at the conclusion negotiations and reflected in the MAS contract. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Price Reductions clause requires MAS contractors to notify the contracting officer of price reductions at the same time that commercial customers are notified. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Price Reductions clause is needed to assure that the Government maintains the relative discount position, negotiated at the time of contract award, throughout the term of the contract. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The estimated annual burden for the Price Reductions clauses is 24,508 hours. This is based upon an estimated average burden per response of 2 hours, a frequency of 2 responses per respondent, and an estimated number of likely respondents of 6,127. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in CFR Parts 538 and 552 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Government procurement. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, it is proposed that 48 CFR parts 538 and 552 be amended as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.

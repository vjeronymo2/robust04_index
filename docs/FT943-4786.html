			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Bowater For once, Bowater's managers were able to present a set of results without shooting themselves in the foot. Last time they reported, their unjustified pessimism about prospects for margins overwhelmed a good set of figures, sending shares tumbling 8 per cent on the day. In fact, fears that the company would prove incapable of passing on increases in raw material prices to customers proved, on the whole, unfounded. With hindsight, managers' undue gloom destroyed a premium rating. Yesterday, the group lacked adequate ammunition to inflict such self-damage. The results, above expectations, contained scarcely a blemish. Margins reached a record high, and the company achieved double digit growth in sales, operating profits and pre-tax results. An upbeat chairman's statement completed the rosy package. Equally significant in yesterday's 4 per cent rise in the shares - against a falling market - was the management's indication that Bowater had reached a strategic turning point. The company, managers indicated, will no longer expand through acquisition. Growth will be achieved organically and through cost-cutting. There may be some bolt-on acquisitions, but these are likely to be small and not to require equity funding. Given Bowater's privileged position in fast-growing niches and the absence of additional equity issues in the foreseeable future, the shares should prove attractive for those looking to switch out of cyclical companies and into growth stocks.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Philippe Engels: "The Prime Minister Has a </F> Little Taste of Popularity"]    [Text] For the first time since the establishment of the  Survey and Action L'ECHO opinion polls almost two years ago, the  record of the Dehaene government's operation is deemed to be  positive by a narrow majority of the managers questioned.    The April 1994 poll reveals that 51 percent of managers  think  the Dehaene government's action is "fairly positive," 46 percent  regard it as "fairly negative," and 3 percent prefer not to give  an opinion. Compared with December 1993, these results have  only slightly changed, but enough to give the federal executive  the support of the managers' "majority."    What should be pointed out is that after seeming to be very  unpopular for several months, the government has gradually won  back credibility among the economic decisionmakers. Witness the  fact that in December 1992, after nearly one year in government,  it only received a 28 percent favorable rating; in April 1993  that percentage was no more than 18 percent (with a 78 percent  unfavorable rating). The recovery, which is fairly clear, took  shape in December 1993 after the overall plan was made official  (46 percent favorable rating, 49 percent unfavorable rating).    The prime minister's personality is a contributory factor.  To the question: "Do you have confidence in the following  institutions to solve the current problems (federal government,  prime minister, regional and community executives, political  parties, European Commissions...)," Jean-Luc Dehaene enjoys the  greatest score of confidence. Fifty-five percent of managers  say they have confidence in him, compared to 51 percent in  December 1993 and only 28 percent in April 1993. The federal  government receives a 41 percent favorable rating in this sphere  (compared to 22 percent a year ago). It is outstripped by the  European Commission (45 percent), which has nonetheless dropped  compared to April 1993 (50 percent). The Belgian Parliament is  unchanged with a 31 percent favorable rating. With 12 and 8  percent expressing confidence in them, the political parties and  the politicians in general have gone a little further down the  scale of perception by the economic decisionmakers.    In passing, we should note here that the regional and  community governments enjoy less credibility (levels of  confidence of 37 and 35 percent, compared to 43 and 39 percent a  year ago). Just three out of every 10 managers think the record  of the ministers in their region is positive, compared with a  proportion of four out of 10 in April 1993.    Overall, although the federal government's popularity has  increased a little, the economic decisionmakers have a fairly  negative or even very negative overall judgement of political  circles.    It is therefore not surprising that the current efficacy of  our government in terms of the handling of contemporary problems  should suffer discredit as a result. More than 60 percent of  managers do not think that Belgium will be able to satisfy the  Maastricht objective, aimed at reducing the overall public  deficit to 3 percent of GDP by 1996. Compared with last  December, this percentage has not changed (which is logical,  because the spring budget changes were only modest adjustment  operations). Compared with April 1993, pessimism has increased.    In addition, almost 100 percent (98 percent to be precise)  of  the sample think it likely that unemployment will increase in  the coming months. Ninety percent expect a reduction in the  purchasing power of cadres, 58 percent expect major social  conflicts, 51 percent a political crisis, 31 percent an erosion  of the Belgian franc, however only 25 percent expect an increase  in inflation.    As was the case last December, more economic decisionmakers  think that Belgium is "fairly ill-equipped" (51 percent) than  "fairly well equipped" (45 percent) to face the near future. In  April 1993, the proportions were reversed.</p>

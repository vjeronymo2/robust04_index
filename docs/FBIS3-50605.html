			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] (NA) -- The cost of services has gone up by as much  as 157 percent since the start of convertibility, the UADE  [Argentine Business University] Argentine business university  reported yesterday.    Some of the figures released by the UADE register almost  triple the 53 percent inflation measured by the government since  the convertibility plan was introduced in April 1991.    Rents have gone up by a staggering 157.2 percent while  doctors and dentists have increased their fees by up to 137  percent. Hairdressers were not far behind as their rates have  bounded skyward, bringing them up to 103 percent higher.    According to the UADE report domestic help has kept pace  with  this upward surge and is now an average 99.9 percent more  expensive.    Most people, with their wages seemingly stuck to a very low  floor, have been amazed to see the cost of entertainment bubble  up and up. A ticket to a football match now costs 92 percent  more than nearly three years ago, as do cinemas and theaters.    Also hitting the wage earner's pocket has been the cost of  the midday meal, which has gone up by a belt-tightening 77  percent since convertibility began.    Transport would appear to be the only service whose prices  have gone up less than official amount for accumulated  inflation. Short distance bus fares have increased 40 percent  while the cost of a ticket on a commuter train has gone up by  only 23 percent.    The UADE points out that the price rises in the last 12  months have caused a drop in the industrial worker's purchasing  power in most areas. Widespread clothing imports have made  refurbishing ones wardrobe one of the few good deals around.  Purchasing power in terms of clothing has improved by 10 percent.</p>

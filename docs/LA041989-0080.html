			<p><P> April 19, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Arthur Henry Burton Jr., a U.S. citizen deported by the Sandinista government  after his private plane crash-landed in Nicaragua, was questioned and released  by U.S. Customs Service officials when he arrived in Miami aboard a Costa Rican  airliner. Managua had charged that Burton, 39, was on his way to Colombia to  pick up cocaine when he crashed March 25. A Customs official said that because  of the "possible drug involvement," Burton was interrogated when he entered the  United States but was then "sent on his way."  </P></p>

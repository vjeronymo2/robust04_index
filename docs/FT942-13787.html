			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Survey of Egypt (15): Quick on its feet and full of women - The Alexandria Businessmen's Association The Alexandria Businessmen's Association is really a misnomer, writes Robin Allen. First, it is as much a private sector development agency as an association. Second, it has so many women members that it intends soon to rename itself the Alexandria Business Association. But what sets it apart from more conventional business groups is the role it plays in fostering large numbers of small and micro-size private sector businesses. It started in 1978: a business committee under the umbrella of the official chamber of commerce, with which all companies have to register. But while there are about 130,000 members of the chamber, the ABA has only 280 members: big enough to be representative and influential; small enough to be quick on its feet. ABA has six main aims: to improve understanding and promote contacts between private and public sectors; to promote trade and investment contacts with private sectors abroad; to safeguard the interests of Alexandria's private sector and evaluate macro and micro economic issues for local companies; to improve the city's economic and business climate; to improve community services for social reasons by providing new hospitals, schools and community centres and renovating those which need it; and to help the local private sector with start-up and working capital. It is the existence and the success of these last two which mark ABA from more conventional groups. Mr Kemal Sid Ahmed, vice-president, says that in a city such as Alexandria the bigger businessmen have to have - and want to have - a sense of service to the community if the role of the private sector is to be understood and accepted. Individual gifts and donations for private sector community or social organisations are tax deductible for up to only 7 per cent of a company's net profits. Donations to the public sector are 100 per cent tax deductible. But the thrust of the ABA's efforts to the private sector is through the small and micro enterprise development projects. ABA is a non-profit making group. But its investments in small and very small businesses are managed on commercial, free-market principles: small businesses, including simple artisan workshops, are scrutinised first for their viability. Loans have to be repaid on time and in full. In fact, ABA acts as an investment bank to cottage industries. 'Micro' is defined as a workshop employing up to five workers; 'small' is between five and 15 workers. The programme is managed partly with the US Agency for International Development (USAID), which has provided Dollars 10m for running capital for small businessmen selected by ABA. In the last four years, ABA has disbursed EPounds 49m (Dollars 14.5m), and claims to have created 20,000 jobs by increasing productivity. The prompt repayment rate, Mr Sid Ahmed says, is a healthy 98.7 per cent; there are very few delinquent borrowers, and those few are thereafter barred from any further involvement with ABA's lending programme. Given that about 1,000 applications are processed a month, this rate says something for the efficiency of ABA's three-man evaluating team. It is something no commercial bank in Egypt - certainly no public sector bank - could possibly match. Parallel with its loan activity, ABA has set up community centres encouraging local people to maintain Alexandria's homogeneity. It also has a research studies centre attracting speakers from all levels of government and business. The association is now discussing with USAID a proposal for a management institute* in Alexandria for middle and senior management. This could ultimately be linked to US business schools offering nine-month courses to Alexandria's younger business managers. * All enquiries should be addressed to the Alexandria Businessmen's Association, 52 El-Horreya Avenue, Alexandria, Egypt.

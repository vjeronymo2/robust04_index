			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Japanese take pacts in their stride Japan's business community had resigned itself to some market opening agreement before the partial accord covering US-Japanese trade issues was announced, Michiyo Nakamoto writes from Tokyo. Even the car industry, which could be adversely affected by the US decision to initiate a Section 301 investigation of the replacement parts industry, took the latest US verdict in its stride. 'Once the business environment improves it will be possible to prove that the Japanese market is not closed,' one industry official commented. In the glass industry there was relief that the talks did not result in sanctions, as well as a sense that their claims about the openness of the market had been vindicated. 'The flat glass market in Japan is by no means closed and we will aim to meet our users' satisfaction in line with the anti-monopoly law,' Mr Kazuo Shinya, vice-president of Asahi Glass, said. The main concern for Japanese business has not been so much the impact of likely sanctions, which has never been considered significant, as the adverse effect another rupture with the US could have on currency rates.</p>

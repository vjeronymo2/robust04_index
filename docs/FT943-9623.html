			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Ukraine must have assistance Sir, Congratulations for the objective and comprehensive analysis by Jill Barshay of the situation in Ukraine since Leonid Kuchma's accession to the presidency (''Twere well it were done quickly, August 2). I agree with her that one is likely to see rapid moves towards economic reform in Ukraine. However, unlike Barshay, who sees the parliament of Ukraine as the main obstacle to economic reform, I feel it is a case of shared responsibility with western powers. Indeed, the west has been promising economic assistance to Ukraine since independence, yet has not delivered. Should the G7 not release fairly quickly a portion of the promised Dollars 4bn, the pro-Russian tendency might be strengthened. This could spell disaster, not only for Ukraine's independence, but for the west's interest in keeping a proper balance of power in the area.

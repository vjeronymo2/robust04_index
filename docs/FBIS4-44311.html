			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Following his first foreign trip since becoming  head of government, which took him to Brussels and Paris, Mokdad  Sifi has reiterated that the outcome of his visits were --  according to our colleague Noreddine Bouziane's report from  Paris -- positive.    [Begin Bouziane recording] The statements Prime Minister  Sifi  made after his meetings with French and Belgian officials have  indicated that his visits to Paris and Brussels have  accomplished their goals    It has become clear, however, that the trip was aimed at  achieving two things: First, to muster political support for  the reform efforts of the Algerian authorities; and second, to  secure financial support needed for winning the battle of  economic reforms in Algeria. In this respect, one should say  that Sifi will not return to Algeria empty-handed: France has  promised Algeria 6 billion francs; the European Commission has  indicated that it would be releasing $240 million to Algeria  this year.    In his news conference, Sifi reiterated his satisfaction  with  the outcome of his visit to France and affirmed that the  authorities in Algeria were not at odds with the European  governments, which have been urging them to open a dialogue with  the Islamic moderates. [passage omitted]    According to Sifi, the resolve of the authorities was still  intact: They are still seeking dialogue with anyone who  respects the Constitution and denounces violence. [passage  omitted]    He added that the French, Belgian, and European officials he  met during the last few days had affirmed to him their real  support in all spheres in order to allow Algeria to overcome its  crisis and play its role in the promotion of cooperation between  the Arab Maghreb and Europe and the stability of the region.    Replying to a question on a possible rift between Paris and  Washington, he asserted that he felt, following the Algerian  foreign minister's visit to Washington, that there was a great  agreement in their respective viewpoints in view of the fact  that Algeria did not reject to broaden dialogue to other parties  that have denounced violence.    For his part, Juppe has also pointed out on the same issue  that he felt, after President Bill Clinton's recent visit to  Paris, that there was great agreement in their respective  viewpoints. He added: President Clinton told us he was  supportive of the process to regain stability in Algeria as well  as of economic reforms. [passage omitted] [end recording]</p>

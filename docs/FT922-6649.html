			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Major gives warm welcome to accord MR JOHN MAJOR gave an enthusiastic welcome to the farm talks deal yesterday. He said an agreement on reforming the Common Agricultural Policy would be good for farmers, consumers and the future of world trade. Although consumers will have to wait until the middle of the decade before benefiting from cheaper food prices, British farmers welcomed the end of the uncertainty surrounding their businesses. 'It would appear that John Gummer (agriculture minister) has achieved quite a remarkable victory on behalf of all UK arable farmers,' the managing director of a large farming company said. He was delighted that Britain had not been left at a disadvantage to smaller European competitors. Speaking in the House of Commons, Mr Major said that the deal was good news for the British farmer, for the British consumer, for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade negotiations, for world trade and for many developing countries. He congratulated Mr Gummer on his negotiating stance during the marathon Brussels negotiating session. The prime minister made it clear that the accord was closely in tune with the thrust of Britain's own proposals, which were designed to protect farmers while progressively reducing the EC's massive stocks of agricultural products. Whitehall officials said that the proposed shift towards a system of farm payments tied to supporting incomes rather than paying for surpluses could provide the background for a deal with the US in the stalled Uruguay round of world trade talks. More specifically, they welcomed the fact that the proposals to compensate cereals farmers for taking land out of production took account of the much larger average size of British farms. Labour warned that the reforms were as likely to fail in reducing surpluses as previous efforts had been. Mr David Clark, shadow agriculture minister, said that the only effects would be that 'the cost to the UK taxpayers will increase in each of the next few years; the consumer will not benefit; farmers will get large pay-offs.' While Britain's farmers expressed relief that uncertainty had been resolved, reaction in France was tougher, where farmers condemned the deal and said that they would take to the streets immediately in protest. German farmers said subsidy cuts would lead to collapse in many farm regions, which would be hit by drastic price cuts in grain and other crops. Italian farming lobbies reacted angrily to reforms which left their country out in the cold. 'This is a completely unsatisfactory deal,' an association of farmers said.</p>

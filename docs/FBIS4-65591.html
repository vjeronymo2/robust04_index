			<p>BFN     [Text] The Council of Ministers has discussed the fight  against terrorism and foreign policy issues.    The Council of Ministers met under Prime Minister Tansu  Ciller for two and a half hours last night. In a statement  after the meeting, Yildirim Aktuna, state minister and  government spokesman, said that the interior minister briefed  the Council of Ministers on the developments in the fight  against terrorism. Aktuna pointed out that as a result of the  determined attitude of the government regarding this issue, the  terrorist organization incurred significant logistic [word  indistinct] and personnel losses, especially during recent  months. He pointed out that the morale of the separatist  terrorist organization is very low, and consequently, increasing  numbers of members are deserting the organization.    Aktuna charged that the terrorist organization is  continuously avoiding a confrontation with the security forces  and is suffering from a shortage of food, weapons, and  ammunition. He said: Our security forces will continue to  effectively carry out operations both inside the country and  across our borders until such time as the separatist terrorist  organization is completely eliminated.    Aktuna then said that the foreign minister briefed the  Council of Ministers on the latest developments regarding the  Cyprus and Azerbaijan issues.    Replying to a question, Aktuna stressed that the terrorist  organization's efforts to force the citizens in the southeast to  emigrate to northern Iraq are aimed at deceiving the world. The  necessary measures have been taken in connection with this  issue, he said.    Replying to another question, Aktuna said that the Council  of  Ministers did not discuss whether or not to extend the state of  emergency.</p>

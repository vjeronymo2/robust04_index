			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRESTED BUTTE: THE LITTLE SKI TOWN THAT CARES  </P> <P> "Hot chocolate and keep it coming," I pleaded as I sank into the cozy booth at  Bubba's, the mid-mountain restaurant tucked into the Paradise Warming House in  this Colorado resort town.  </P> <P> Leaky boots and Popsicle toes, the bane of my ski life, led me to start  dismantling my ski boots while waiting for my burger.  </P> <P> The mega-burger came and the waiter, seeing my plight, offered to take the  inner lining of my boots to the back and put them in the clothes dryer.  </P> <P> This is what sets Crested Butte apart from other towns like it -- people really  care here. Sounds corny, but it's true.  </P> <P> It's only 20 miles over the hill from Aspen, as the crow flies, but Crested  Butte might as well be 2,000 miles away. As the most isolated and arguably  least known of Colorado's winter resorts, the area has virtually nothing in  common with its neighbor, other than the smattering of restored 1880s  buildings.  </P> <P> Many of Colorado's historic mountain towns have been rebuilt to the point where  they bear little resemblance to their early look. In Crested Butte, most of the  buildings have remained "original equipment," giving a very special feel to  this National Historic District.  </P> <P> This is Western skiing at its best. Wide open, uncrowded, sunny, plenty of  powder, long beginner/intermediate cruising trails and double-black-diamond  tough stuff on the hidden back side.  </P> <P> Just a word or two about this "hidden back side." Until a few years ago,  adrenaline junkies had to hike for 20 minutes to reach the ungroomed powder  stashes of the North Face and Phoenix Bowl. In 1987, the resort decided to  access the steep, rugged terrain with a two-minute lift, yet maintain the wild,  back-country flavor. It's now a Mecca for adventure-minded experts.  </P> <P> Crested Butte is also great for walking, loaded as it is with restaurants,  shops and interesting nooks and crannies. A walk down Elk Avenue, along blocks  of authentic Victorian buildings, provides a reminder of how the town appeared  in the 1880s. The wooden floors are uneven and the walls are the same ones  Butch Cassidy saw when he came through town and had a drink at Kochevar's  Saloon and Gaming Hall, which still operates today.  </P> <P> This is an eating, drinking town. You'll be welcome in the most elegant  restaurants in your turtleneck and ski parka. The charm is raw and genuine and  a little rough around the edges, but it's real.  </P> <P> Actually there are two Crested Buttes. One is the aforementioned Victorian  mining town, the other is the ski village, Crested Butte Mountain Resort on Mt.  Crested Butte, which is three miles down the road by free shuttle bus.  </P> <P> Mt. Crested Butte is where most of the glitz is found, ranging from condos and  lodges to the hedonistic Grande Butte Hotel. The ski village has its own share  of shops and restaurants, but come nightfall, the action is in town. The  shuttle buses run all the time, so it's just plain silly to have a car here.  </P> <P> One of the best-kept secrets in the ski world is just 12 miles from Crested  Butte. It's the Irwin Lodge. Located at 10,700 feet, it's accessible only by  snowcat or snowmobile during the winter. The lodge is an immense  27,000-square-foot cedar log structure with 23 guest rooms, all with private  baths, and the most romantic luxury suite I've ever seen. When you arrive at  Irwin Lodge, you have found the ultimate getaway. Your private ski mountain.  </P> <P> The lodge has a snowcat powder skiing operation that is the adventure of a  lifetime. With an average base of 365 inches of snow -- up to 100 feet of snow  falls during the season -- there's virtually no ski day when there won't be  great deep powder conditions. In fact, since management puts only 48 people a  day on their terrain, they can guarantee that at no time will your tracks cross  those of another skier.  </P> <P> A day-trip for a Crested Butte Mountain Resort guest runs $140, with group  discounts available. A package with lodging, meals and skiing starts at $161  per day. Comparing this with helicopter skiing, which can cost about $500 a  day, one realizes what a really good deal this is.  </P> <P> If helicopter skiing is your thing, Irwin Lodge has customized helicopter tours  offering quick access to numerous peaks and slopes in the company's permit area  for spectacular first-track descents.  </P> <P> In addition to alpine skiing, the lodge offers cross-country equipment and  trails, plus ice fishing, snowshoeing and snowmobile tours.  </P> <P> A number of all-inclusive special vacations are available, including powder  skiing weeks at Irwin Lodge or combined Silvergate/Crested Butte Mount Resort  packages. For Irwin Lodge, call (303) 349-5308, or book through Crested Butte  Vacations at (800) 544-8448.  </P> <P> You can't talk about skiing without talking about snowfall. There are so many  contradictory claims that it's hard to know who to believe, but here's an  independent source: According to statistics gathered from 1951 to 1985 by the  Colorado Climate Center at Colorado State University, Crested Butte has the  highest average annual snowfall of any ski town in Colorado -- 229 inches.  Also-rans include Telluride (184.6), Steamboat (172.2) and Breckenridge (162).  </P> <P> One of the things I like best about Crested Butte is that it is off the beaten  path. It's remote but accessible. That may seem to be a contradiction in terms,  but it's true. Just 28 miles down the road is Gunnison Airport, which is served  by numerous airlines. This kind of convenience lets you pack more skiing into  your valuable vacation time.  </P> <P> I love a big mountain with just enough skiers on it to make it interesting. And  I hate lift lines. This is where Crested Butte shines. With 854 skiable acres  and a bed base for only 3,000 people, the town can be full but the mountain is  not. The only lift line I ever encountered was a five-minute wait at 2 p.m. on  the Paradise lift taking skiers back onto the mountain after lunch.  </P> <P> Crested Butte is both a close-knit community and a real destination resort.  Other than Gunnison, which is actually a small town, it's not close to any  large city, so it does not have the influx of day-skiers. Saturday afternoon is  just about the same as Tuesday morning. The hotels and condos were pretty well  sold out when I was there, and still not a lift line to be seen.  </P> <P> One telephone number books everything from airline tickets, hotels, car rentals  and lift tickets to on-mountain barbecues. Call (800) 525-4220.  </P> <P> You can fly from Los Angeles to Gunnison via American Airlines, United/United  Express, Delta or Continental/Continental Express. A good shuttle service is  available from the airport, thus a rental car isn't necessary.  </P></p>

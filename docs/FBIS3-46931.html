			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by correspondent Kazuichi Sekiguchi in Washington: </F> "Putting Pressure on Japan To Get Pledges on Expanded Purchase"]    [Text] There are two purposes for U.S. Trade  Representative Michael Kantor calling for an emergency meeting  under the Japan-U.S. Semiconductor Agreement. One is to request  Japan to promise further expansion of its purchase of foreign  semiconductors in 1994 and thereafter, and the other is to  secure explanatory material to be given to the U.S. Congress and  domestic industry in case the [foreign semiconductors'] average  share of 20 percent [in the Japanese market] in 1993 is not  achieved.    Kantor has presented two conditions for implementing the  agreement: (1) steady growth of the share, and (2) achievement  of an average of 20 percent in the share in 1993. But these  conditions are not going to be met. While it is necessary to  raise the foreign products' share for the October-December  period to 23.1 percent to meet the 20-percent target for the  whole year, all Japanese corporations concerned have already  placed their orders for the year, and "achievement of the target  is hopeless" (according to an official of the U.S. industry).    Upon hearing the U.S. Government announcement [on the  emergency meeting], Procasini [name as published], managing  director of the U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA),  issued a statement supporting such an emergency meeting. The  Semiconductor Agreement is due to be revised next year. He  apparently thinks "the United States can achieve more by  extracting practical promises in the talks on such matters as  raising the market share" than by just criticizing Japan.    The U.S. Government -- going all out to get its way on trade  policy as seen in getting the NAFTA approved -- is putting  emphasis on obtaining agreements on priority topics in the  economic consultations at the Japan-U.S. summit in February.  Consequently, while it assumes a flexible stand on the question  of setting objective criteria, it demands strict implementation  in areas where there are agreements -- as in semiconductors,  construction projects, and cellular phones. In other words, the  United States is engaged in "two-pronged operations."    Lawrence Summers, U.S. under secretary of the treasury, in a  28 December TV interview, put pressure on Japan, saying, "I hope  they (Japan) will keep their word." Meanwhile, Trade  Representative Kantor has not changed his hard-line position on  the Semiconductor Agreement, hinting at the possibility of  enforcing sanctions. But his real purpose is to include the  semiconductors as a topic in the Japan-U.S. economic  consultations in January and February -- before the summit --  and to force a political decision out of Japan and get the  maximum possible concessions from it.</p>

			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / The City Bombing: Reaction to the bombing 'London is the financial capital not just of Britain but of Europe and indeed the world. I have every confidence that business will continue to locate here and work successfully here. To do otherwise would be to succumb to terrorism which is a threat not just in Britain but internationally.' Norman Lamont 'Our computer data is all safe, but our files are spread around the City. If anyone sees a piece of paper with our logo on, could they kindly pick it up and return it to us?' Hongkong and Shanghai Bank spokeswoman 'This great city has faced plague, pestilence, fire and the Blitz and it has won through. It will do so again and the IRA have no more hope of killing the spirit of London and its people than Hitler had.' The Rev Eric Evans, dean of St Paul's 'Why are more of these people not caught? And when caught why is it so difficult to convict them?' David Mellor 'This is a continuance of the campaign being waged by the IRA. We had hoped after the deaths in Warrington that this had been some sort of turning point, but here we have death again.' David Tucker, head of the police anti-terrorist squad</p>

One precondition, however, is that the East European  reformist state creates the necessary economic conditions for  it, Kohl said on Tuesday [1 March] after a meeting with Boross  in Bonn. In return, Germany is ready to provide help for  self-help. The FRG is by far Hungary's most important trading  partner, with an almost 30-percent share in exports and imports.  In April, the federal chancellor is planning a visit to the  Hungarian capital Budapest following an invitation by Boross.    Kohl once more pointed to the opening of Hungary's borders,  which meant freedom for thousands of GDR [German Democratic  Republic] citizens in the summer of 1989. This is a  particularly important chapter in the long history of  German-Hungarian relations that will never be forgotten, Kohl  said.    Boross expressed his thanks for the FRG's readiness to help  in the difficult process of political and economic  transformation of his former socialist country. He emphasized  Hungary's desire to become a full member in the European Union  as well as NATO as soon as possible. He was optimistic that  this would soon be the case as far as the OECD is concerned,  Boross said.    During his one-day visit, Boross signed a German-Hungarian  culture agreement. In the afternoon, talks were planned with  Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, of the Free Democratic Party of  Germany, and with representatives of the German economy.</p>

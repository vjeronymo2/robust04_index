			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, June 24 (ATA) -- At the beginning of the  yesterday's session, the deccan [as received] of the defence  attorneys, Kleanthi Koci, requested that the jury, in other  judicial processes, should take into consideration the extension  of the defence's right in order to avoid technical mistakes  which were noticed during this process.    In absence of his client, Manush Myftiu's attorney read the  defence saying of his defendant and though he did not accepted  the charge, he said that he considers the jury's decision to be  reasonable and requested that the decision should be take his  health into consideration.    Adil Carcani's attorney requested the innocence of his  client, trying to justify the acts of which he is accused. In  regard to the part of treatment of the Hoxha family, after the  death of the dictator [Enver Hoxha], the attorney said if the  Central Committee secretary and the chairman of the former  government decided for such a treatment, the purposes were very  noble and dignified for the Albanian nation.    Kleanthi Koci, Ramiz Alia's attorney, pointed out that this  process is of a great importance for the history of the Albanian  nation. Attorney Koci supports the innocence of his client  saying that he has not found elements of crime and genocide  carried out by Ramiz Alia. He said that Ramiz Alia had agreed  with the special treatment of the former leadership, had  approved the platform of the former secret police, and had made  democratic improvements in it. Koci said that Ramiz Alia had  approved the anti-religious and anti- constitutional movement in  the 1967, and had agreed with the treatment of the Hoxha family  after the death of the dictator, all of these acts in the  context of his official duties. Attorney Koci appreciated the  figure of his client as a former president though Prosecutor  Fana has made clear in the first session that Ramiz Alia is not  being accused of any acts he committed during the time he was  president.    The attorney of defendants Rita Marko and Hekuran Isai did  not accepted the decision of the pretence for defendant Rita  Marko [as received] saying that it is a partial attitude toward  this client because as he said, the state of health of Rita  Marko is the same as those of A. Carcanit and M. Myftiu. The  attorney said he believes that the jury will declare a suspended  sentence for defendant Rita Marko.    Hekuran Isai's attorney said that his client does not accept  the charge for legal reasons.    The attorney of Aranit Cela tried to justify the activity of  the Internment-Expulsion Commission.    The defence attorney of Rapi Mino spoke once again for the  way of proceeding of the State Commission for  Interment-Expulsion based on the analyses made by him and  witnesses during the judicial investigations.    The attorney of defendant Veiz Haderi did not accepted the  charge against his client.    During the yesterday's seance, the defendants also expressed  last saying [as received]. Speaking for half an hour, Ramiz  Alia considered his charge as a staged and spoke of past and  current current Albanian policy. Ramiz Alia did not mentioned  the parts of the accusation against him, because as he said at  the beginning, the sentence and its measure were of no  importance for him, but avoiding the trial's issues he spoke of  the actions for constructing the railways, for the last  elections in Libofsha commune, for the Anti-Fascist National  Liberation War and its anniversaries.    The decision for the 10 former high communist functionaries  will be declared on Tuesday, June 28, 1994.</p>

			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / People: Willett returns to retail life at Littlewoods Bob Willett has been appointed managing director of Littlewoods stores, the chain store division of the private retail and football pools group. Willett, 47, resigned as chief executive of Gateway, the trading subsidiary of Isosceles in October last year when the heavily indebted food retail company was in the throes of a financial restructuring. He had come in for criticism as Gateway had missed trading budgets. He had had a three year contract at Pounds 195,000 a year. He first joined Gateway in 1987 from Owen Owen, the department store group, where he was operations director. He started as non-foods director and became marketing director a year later. When David Smith launched a leveraged bid for Gateway's parent Dee Corporation in spring 1989, Willett and three other Gateway directors supported the bid and were suspended by then chairman Alec Monk. After Smith's Pounds 2.1bn bid succeeded, Willett returned as chief executive of Gateway. He survived the departure of Smith in autumn 1991, when the group was already having difficulty meeting its onerous debt commitments, only to fall a year ago. After leaving Gateway, Willett attempted to buy a retail business with venture capital backing - rumoured to be the Mark One chain of budget fashion shops - but he has now returned to big store life. Willett takes over from Bryan Mayoh, who has filled the MD's position at Littlewoods chain stores for the past few months - a position which had previously been vacant since the departure of Bill Huntley who moved to head Littlewoods' home shopping division three years ago. Mayoh has been promoted to managing director of Index, the catalogue shopping division, to succeed James Higginbotham, who is recovering from major heart surgery. Mayoh began his career at Littlewoods in the mid-1980s in the computer section of the group management services department. He became director of management services, and then moved to the home shopping division as director of credit and collections. Higginbotham, managing director of Index since October 1988 during which time the chain grew from 75 stores to its present 126, is expected to return to work next spring, to head a group project designed to improve Littlewoods' operating efficiency and profits. Littlewoods also recently created two new directors' posts. Janet Rubin, who has held senior human resources positions in Burton group, Kingfisher's B&amp;Q, and WH Smith, has been appointed group human resources director. Christopher Baker, for several years a business consultant to Littlewoods, has joined as corporate strategy director, responsible for exploring strategic opportunities and long-term group development. His previous experience was with Coopers &amp; Lybrand, Hill Samuel, Morgan Grenfell and the Treasury.</p>

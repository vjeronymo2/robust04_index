			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Coal to be split for sell-off against management wish BRITISH COAL is to be offered for sale as five regional businesses, contrary to the wishes of its management, which wanted to keep it together. Announcing preliminary details of the privatisation yesterday, Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, said that this structure was most likely to attract buyers. But he emphasised that a purchaser could bid for any number of parcels, so British Coal could still be sold in one piece. A privatisation bill will be put to the next parliamentary session so that the sale can be made by early summer 1994. The regions into which British Coal will be split for the sale will be Scotland, Wales, the north-east and the central coalfield, to be divided in two based on Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire. The businesses will be offered to trade buyers, but government finance is also available to help management and employees put together buy-out teams. Mr Neil Clarke, British Coal's chairman, said: 'It will be interesting to see, following their assessment of the business and the various risks involved, whether prospective purchasers will be seeking combinations of sale packages when they submit offers to the government.' Mr Eggar said he had received expressions of interest reaching 'double figures'. 'This structure is just what we wanted,' said Mr Richard Budge, chief executive of RJB Mining. The UDM, the breakaway miners' union, said it also was working on a bid, with East Midlands Electricity and an unnamed foreign partner. A threat to the sale emerged yesterday, however, when Nacods, the mining supervisors' union, was allowed by the courts to challenge a radical overhaul - essential to privatisation - of health and safety regulations. The High Court ruled that the reforms might conflict with the health and safety law principle that changes must not lead to a deterioration in safety rules. The reforms, which are due to take effect on October 1, abolish the function of deputy, the supervisory workers represented by Nacods, replace some statutes with codes of practice and give mine managers more discretion over applying safety rules.

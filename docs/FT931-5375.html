			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Bundesbank policymakers are back in driving seat: They may now use repo operations more often to steer money market rates downwards IT WAS a slice of salami, a step in the right direction, a signal, a carrot, and most of all another surprise. Economists and sundry commentators trawled the thesaurus for suitable reactions yesterday after the Bundesbank gave German interest rates a further downwards prod. The cut of almost a quarter point in rates for next week's securities repurchase deals was all of these. Even though Mr Johann Gaddum, a directorate member, was wheeled out later to announce that the change was not to be seen as an indicator that the discount and Lombard rates would fall at the next council meeting on March 18, no-one was in a mood to believe him. The cut in the repo rate to within 0.25 points of the 8 per cent discount rate - the official floor level - was read as the second signal in a month that official short-term rates are on a downward slope. 'We are on the way from point A to point B. It is now a question of how we get there and how quickly,' said Mr Richard Reid, chief economist at the Union Bank of Switzerland in Frankfurt. But Mr Gaddum's argument that current data suggested a need for 'small steps' was widely accepted, at least until progress is made on budget consolidation and the French elections are out of the way. 'Then the dancing can really begin,' suggested Mr Adolf Rosenstock, chief economist at the local office of the Industrial Bank of Japan. The Bundesbank's latest move was also seen as a sign that its policymakers have regained control of their strategy and tactics after disturbances in the European exchange rate mechanism forced a hasty cut in official rates at their early February meeting. If there are no more ERM upsets - a tricky scenario in the light of the impending French elections - the Bundesbank can be expected to continue using its 'repo operations' to steer money market rates downwards and cutting official rates as they fall. Yesterday's manoeuvre also underlined a point which Mr Schlesinger has been trying to make for some months, that the repo instrument is not only a more flexible tool than the official rates, it is a more important indicator. As Mr Hermann Remsperger, chief economist at the BHF bank noted, yesterday's cut was nothing less than a 'reduction in leading rates'. According to Mr Rosenstock, the central council, which includes the heads of the regional central banks, had now stopped its internal squabbling. The February reductions in official rates had harmed the bank's credibility, but now a consensus appeared to have been reached. 'They are singing with one voice like a choir,' he added. 'At least there are not so many soloists.' A sudden and marked reduction in the number of speeches and lectures delivered by individual members tends to support this view. While international pressure for rate cuts in the interests of protecting the ERM and easing the climb out of recession has been uncomfortable, the greatest source of tension among council members has probably been Germany's own economic plunge. Regional representatives have been trailing into Frankfurt every fortnight with ever grimmer tales of economic woe. A 22 per cent slump in January's industrial output in Baden-Wurttemberg, reported yesterday, was only the latest example. But they seem to have been convinced that regional and national interests are best served in the long run if the bank keeps its deliberations focused on its main responsibilities, D-Mark stability and control of inflation, and returns to its traditionally cautious tactics. Pressure for rate cuts from within the federal government has been effectively diverted back to Bonn, which now holds the key to the extent and timing of the next discount and Lombard changes. Fading money supply growth, sub-inflation wage deals and a just-discernible downward shift in prices meet some of the criteria for cuts, but Chancellor Helmut Kohl has still to convince the Bundesbank that public spending and deficits will be reined in effectively. Mr Kohl meets negotiators from the 16 Lander (states) on March 11 for up to three days of key talks on his solidarity pact for funding revival in the east. According to Mr Rosenstock, a comprehensive deal to complete the chancellor's solidarity package would be a great surprise. 'But if they get half way to a reasonable agreement, March 18 could be the day.' However, as the Bundesbank council showed this week when it sprang its surprise package a day after its routine meeting, the last thing it wants is for its agenda to be set either by the markets or by the media, or for its decisions to become wholly predictable.</p>

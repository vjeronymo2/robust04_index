			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Service costs for offices increased SERVICE charges for office buildings increased faster than inflation last year, according to a report by Jones Lang Wootton, the chartered surveyor and international property consultant. Service charges now represent a larger share of tenants' gross costs as rental levels continue to fall. The report, which covers buildings ranging from 3,000 sq ft to 400,000 sq ft, says the level of service charges last year reflected contract prices agreed in 1990 that had not been influenced by the recession. Jones Lang Wootton estimates that service charges this year will be at or below the average level of inflation as contractors submit increasingly competitive tenders. Insurance costs rose an average of 10 per cent last year and are expected to rise by a further 10 per cent this year in the face of 'uncertainty in the insurance market for commercial property'. The report says service charges accounted for 9.1 per cent of tenants' gross costs last year for air-conditioned buildings in the West End of London compared with 7.8 per cent in 1990, and 7.9 per cent in 1989. In the City, the share of gross costs represented by service charges jumped to 12.5 per cent in 1991 from 8.9 per cent in 1990 and 7 per cent in 1989. Office Service Charge Analysis and Research.

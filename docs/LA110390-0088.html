			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DRIVE-BY GUNMAN CONVICTED OF MURDER IN GANG SHOOTINGS  </P> <P> A street-gang gunman in one of the worst drive-by shooting rampages in Los  Angeles history was convicted Friday of two counts of murder, seven charges of  premediated attempted murder and one count of robbery.  </P> <P> Faitdon Gipson, 18, was found guilty by a Superior Court jury and faces up to  61 years in state prison, plus seven life terms.  </P> <P> He is scheduled to be sentenced Nov. 28.  </P> <P> Because Gipson was only 16 at the time of the shootings, he will not face the  possibility of a death sentence, according to Deputy Dist. Atty. David  Demerjian.  </P> <P> The prosecutor charged that Gipson, described as a "hard-core" gang member, was  the gunman in pay-back shootings near Raymond Avenue and 46th Street on April  1, 1988. Gang member Stacey Childress, 19, was killed and 10 others, including  a 5-year-old child, were wounded.  </P> <P> The night before, Demerjian said, Gipson shot and killed Loul Alemu, 27, a  parking lot attendant, while trying to steal the victim's car, which was  stopped at a red light at 54th Street and Vermont Avenue.  </P> <P> Demerjian said Alemu was wearing a red jacket -- a color associated with the  Bloods street gang -- and Gipson thought he was a rival gang member.  </P> <P> Juvenile Court Judge Donald Pitts decided at a hearing in May, 1988, that  Gipson could be prosecuted as an adult.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 7 KYODO -- The blending of Japanese  and Thai rice for retail, with the latter accounting for at  least 20 percent, will be mandatory as an emergency measure to  cope with any attempts to hoard Japanese rice, the head of the  Food Agency said Monday [7 March].    Hiroshi Ueno, director general of the agency, told reporters  that to counter the high demand for Japanese rice and to ensure  a fair distribution of it among consumers, retailers will be  prohibited from selling Japanese rice alone.    Retailers will, in principle, be obliged to sell blends of  Japanese and Thai rice, basically on an 80-20 percent basis,  Ueno explained.    The agency also decided on other emergency measures,  including stepped-up rice supplies from domestic producing areas  to consumption centers, quicker domestic transportation of  imported rice, a closer watch for attempts to hold back sales of  Japanese rice in anticipation of future price rises, and a  better explanation of rice supply and sales plans to consumers  to dispel worries about supply shortages.    The package of emergency measures will be reported by Farm  Minister Eijiro Hata to a regular cabinet meeting on Tuesday.    Immediately after the meeting, the agency will start giving  administrative guidance to rice wholesalers and retailers.</p>

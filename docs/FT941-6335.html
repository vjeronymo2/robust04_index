			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Observer: Jaffre in good Elf If Baroness Thatcher were to admit to having French business heroes, then Elf Aquitaine boss Philippe Jaffre might well top the list. His stubbornness in attempting to reverse a sharp fall in profits evinces a powerful degree of Thatcherite brinkmanship. Nor is he chary of tough decisions, even if they precipitate a diplomatic incident. A case in point has followed his latest act, that of reducing the newly privatised French oil giant's stake in a showpiece refinery in eastern Germany. It's provoked a protest letter from Chancellor Helmut Kohl to Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister. But Jaffre is a shrewd negotiator, whose rigorous view of profitability was refined during a rapid rise through France's banking system, culminating in the chairmanship of Credit Agricole, the country's biggest bank. On job cuts, however, he takes a less Thatcherite line. Jaffre rejects what he describes as the 'Anglo-Saxon' method of drastic staff reductions, which have been employed at rival oil companies. Instead he talks of continual change and the need to maintain morale. If unemployment results from the eastern German move, it won't be Elf that loses out. Charity begins at home; a Thatcherite virtue if ever there was one.</p>

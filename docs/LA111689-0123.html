			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: SANTA MONICA;  </P> <P> CITY HALTS HOUSING PROJECT  </P> <P> The City Council halted a mid-city condominium project after neighborhood  residents raised concerns over the proposed removal of two pre-1930 bungalows  from the site.  </P> <P> The 4-3 vote overturned the Planning Commission's approval of the project,  which the city staff had recommended because it met all city requirements.  </P> <P> But the council was swayed by a small turnout of residents who contended that  the bungalows were historic structures that should be preserved and that the  new project was not compatible with the neighborhood.  </P> <P> The city's Landmarks Commission, however, voted 4 to 3 last week not to  designate the project's area a historic district and 7 to 0 that the structures  were not landmarks. Approval of either category by the commission would have  also halted the three-story condominium project.  </P> <P> A community group called Mid-City Neighbors presented the council with almost  300 signatures opposing the condominium project, planned for 1253 11th St.  </P> <P> Resident Syd Jurin said the project would cause a "domino effect." Residents  "feel other landlords will follow this example and build more condominiums and  force out the families," he said.  </P> <P> Councilman Ken Genser, however, warned that the council's rejection of the  project is open to legal challenge because the project meets zoning  requirements. He proposed a moratorium on construction that would remove or  destroy a structure that could be historic. "We should delay this project so  that it will get caught up in that moratorium," he said.  </P></p>

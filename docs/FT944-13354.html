			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / International Company News: Acquisitions behind record term at Agco Agco, the fast-growing Atlanta-based farm equipment company, announced record third-quarter net earnings of Dollars 31.9m, or Dollars 1.72 a share, nearly double the Dollars 16.2m, or Dollars 1.15 a share, reported a year earlier, writes Andrew Baxter. The rise mainly reflects Agco's Dollars 329m acquisition of UK-based Massey Ferguson, one of the world's biggest producers of tractors. The deal was completed on June 29.</p>

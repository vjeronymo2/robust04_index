			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / BAe to join forces in helicopter bid: Race for Pounds 700m MoD order prompts link with Franco-German group BRITISH Aerospace has agreed to link up with the Franco-German Eurocopter consortium to bid for the Ministry of Defence's Pounds 700m contract for about 100 attack helicopters. The agreement will pit BAe and the Franco-German group against a rival partnership between Westland, the UK helicopter manufacturer, and McDonnell Douglas of the US. It might also lead to broader co-operation between BAe and Eurocopter and help BAe expand its defence and aerospace interests in the helicopter business, in which it has had a limited presence. Eurocopter is the world's second largest helicopter manufacturer after Sikorsky of the US. It was formed at the beginning of this year when Aerospatiale of France merged its helicopter activities with those of Deutsche Aerospace. Mr Jean Francois Bigay, the Eurocopter chairman, yesterday said the agreement with BAe was initially to study how the two companies could put together a joint bid of Eurocopter's Tiger helicopter for the MoD's requirement of 100 attack helicopters. The Tiger, which will be supplied to the French and German armed forces, will be powered by an engine made by a consortium including Rolls-Royce, MTU of Germany and Turbomeca of France. The Tiger would be competing against the McDonnell Douglas Apache helicopter, which would be produced in co-operation with Westland for the UK requirement. The MoD is expected to seek official bids for its attack helicopter requirement by the middle of next year, with a final decision made late next year or in 1994. Eurocopter had earlier sought to join forces with Westland, but the Yeovil-based company decided instead to team up with McDonnell Douglas. Eurocopter turned to BAe because it needed a UK partner to stand any chance of winning the MoD contract. BAe, in partnership with General Electric Company of the UK, last year bid unsuccessfully to be prime contractor for the Royal Navy's EH101 Merlin anti-submarine helicopters. The contract went to a partnership between IBM of the US and Westland. In spite of this setback BAe has continued to seek to expand into the military helicopter business through its defence systems and services division. A BAe official indicated yesterday that the agreement with Eurocopter 'could eventually go beyond the bid for the UK contract'.</p>

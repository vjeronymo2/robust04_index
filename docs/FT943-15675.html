			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Secret EU 'openness' policy: Council of ministers keeps lid on workings of public access rules The European Union's council of ministers is refusing to disclose information on how it is operating its 'openness' policy, claiming this information is covered by secrecy rules. This latest example of the council's reluctance to deliver on EU promises to guarantee public access to information on decision-making by the 12 member states is nevertheless offset by a shift in policy, under which for the first time there will be a public register of how ministers vote in the council. The council refusal to reveal the reasons for its decisions on requests for information came in a written reply to Mr Peter Brown-Pappamikail, an official of the European Socialist group, the dominant force in the new European parliament. Under a new code of conduct on public access to documents approved by the council - in an effort to quell criticism of its excessive secrecy  - last December, Mr Brown-Pappamikail sought information on the criteria being used by the council bureaucracy to approve or deny requests. To the end of May, only six of 27 requests for information were fully met, the council says. In its reply to Mr Brown-Pappamikail, released yesterday by the Euro-Socialist group, the general secretariat of the council says: 'This is a particularly sensitive file and the preparatory documents which it contains are covered by the obligation of professional secrecy.' There is growing pressure, however, for a full disclosure of how the code is being operated, especially because it contains a discretionary clause allowing refusal 'to protect the confidentiality' of the proceedings in council, the only legislature in Europe which meets behind closed doors. The Netherlands is challenging this catch-all clause in the European Court of Justice. Nevertheless the council is trying to respond to pressure for greater transparency and decided on Wednesday night, however, to establish a public record on how national ministers vote in the council on EU laws. This followed an appeal by the Financial Times against rejection of its request for a record on qualified majority voting (QMV) - those decisions which do not require unanimity - by EU ministers going back to 1989. The council turned down this appeal, claiming it 'is not in possession of any such statistics', and that before last December 'voting in the council was confidential'. But the final reply by the council to the FT - which once signed by the current German presidency of the EU will have the force of law - says that 'for the future the council intends to arrange for statistics on votes made public . . . to be compiled and periodically published.' Some EU diplomats argued yesterday that this step could lead to more formal votes being taken on laws dealt with under QMV, since ministers would need to establish where they stood, in case of questioning by their national parliaments. At the moment, many QMV decisions go through without a formal vote, enabling ministers and officials to claim they were opposed to the measures. Despite this shift, the council came under renewed attack yesterday. Mr Tony Blair, front-runner in the race for the leadership of the British Labour party, said at a meeting in Brussels: 'It is absolutely scandalous that important decisions are taken behind closed doors in Brussels and barely reported to national parliaments afterwards.' Mrs Pauline Green, the British leader of the Socialists in the European parliament, said: 'It is absurd that even the ministers' debates on openness are cloaked in secrecy; ministers should be made accountable for their votes.' Denmark, in an annex to the council reply to the FT, records its abstention on the decision to refuse access to past QMV records. The reason, as the Danes argued again at a meeting of EU ambassadors yesterday, is that it wants a full ministerial debate later this month on the inadequacies of EU information policy. In another annex to the reply to the FT, the Dutch delegation records its vote against the council decision. Holland says the council should collate past votes in council and hand them over. 'By showing this willingness to the applicant, the council would have the opportunity to take a first step in implementing the conclusions of European council in Corfu on transparency and open governance,' the Netherlands said in its declaration. The Corfu summit conclusions were self-critical of the steps so far towards open government, stating that these 'require further elaboration'.</p>

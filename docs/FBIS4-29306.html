			<p>BFN     [Text] Australia, Asia's third largest economy, has  reiterated its misgivings over the formal launching of the East  Asian Economic Caucus (EAEC), saying that its exclusion of the  United States will only create "dangerous fissures" within  Asia-Pacific.    Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans, who left Manila  yesterday after concluding a six day visit, disagreed with the  Philippines' views that the EAEC will be a "meaningful bridge"  between ASEAN and the developed countries.    Evans stressed the EAEC, a sub-regional grouping within  Asia,  was "potentially divisive."    "I think it's very dangerous to the region to develop into  splits or fissures down the Pacific, as between the North  American and East Asian economies. We've seen the dangers that  may be involved in that," Evans explained.    Evans cited the recent trade disagreements between the  United  States and Japan and the United States and China. He said these  potential splits within the Asia-Pacific may be transformed into  wide divisions in the world trade areas if the EAEC pushes  through.    He said that it would be more conducive and productive to  develop the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum which  brings together trade powers from both sides of the Pacific  including the United States, China and Japan.    Foreign Affairs Secretary Roberto Romulo disagreed with  Evans' position, stressing that the EAEC, a concept spearheaded  by Malaysia, was a "value-added" item to APEC-member countries.    Romulo said Evans needs to be educated on the EAEC concept  so  that he would understand the positive effects of the forum  within APEC.    The EAEC was conceived as a loose forum for APEC-member  countries in Asia to discuss achievements gained and informal  agreements arrived at during the APEC meeting last November in  Seattle.    The EAEC has the support in the ASEAN which groups the  Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei, Singapore, Thailand and  Indonesia. It has invited Japan to the forum but shut its doors  to the United States and other North American countries .    "I guess we need to enlighten (Evans) further," adding he  was  informing other EAEC members of Australia's position on the  issue.    Evans, however, supported the Philippines' stand in opposing  the use of non-trade issues such as human rights and labor  conditions on developing countries as prerequisites to trade  relations with rich nations.    He stressed that while Australia puts priority in its human  rights campaign, it shuns the use of this issue as a  protectionist tool by developed countries such as the United  States.    The United States recently granted its most favored nation  status on trade to China, although earlier it had contemplated  tying up the issue with China's human rights record .</p>

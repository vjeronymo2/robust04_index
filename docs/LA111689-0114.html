			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> GROWTH LIMITS LINKED TO RISING ENROLLMENT  </P> <P> In its strongest move to control development to date, the Santa Clarita City  Council has pledged to reject development proposals that would overwhelm school  districts with new students.  </P> <P> Developers would only win city support, the council said, if they agree to  cooperate with the Santa Clarita Valley's five school districts to handle  rising enrollments.  </P> <P> The council unanimously approved a two-page resolution establishing the policy  late Tuesday night. The resolution, which codifies what had been an informal  practice by the City Council and Planning Commission, was approved with little  comment.  </P> <P> The resolution said the city will consider the potential impact on schools when  it reviews requests for zoning changes and general plan amendments. The council  passed the resolution at the urging of the William S. Hart Union High School  District and Saugus Union Elementary School District, where educators say  rising enrollments are outstripping district services.  </P> <P> In effect, the council pledged to abide by a controversial state appellate  court ruling that gives cities and counties the power to reject zoning changes  for housing developments that would crowd schools. The decision in Mira  Development Corp. vs. the city of San Diego, rendered by the state Court of  Appeal last November, has been praised by school districts and education  associations as a way to clamp down on growth.  </P> <P> The City Council's policy puts it at odds with the Los Angeles County Board of  Supervisors, which has been advised by County Counsel De Witt W. Clinton to  ignore the Mira decision because it could violate a state law that sets a limit  on how much money developers must contribute for schools.  </P> <P> To win the support of school trustees for projects, developers might be forced  to make concessions of land or money to have their projects approved by  counties or cities, Clinton said. Such concessions could surpass requirements  of state law, which already force developers to pay school districts $1.56 for  every square foot of residential construction.  </P> <P> Santa Clarita City Atty. Carl K. Newton said that the county counsel  misinterpreted the Mira decision and that the state Legislature's legal counsel  has recommended that cities and counties abide by the ruling.  </P></p>

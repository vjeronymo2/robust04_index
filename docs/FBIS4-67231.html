			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by KAZAKHSTANSKAYA PRAVDA correspondents Irina </F> Bakayeva and Tamara Kaleyeva: "A `Noose' Has Been Thrown Around  the Neck of Crime. What Will Be the Result?"]    [Text] Lately the capital has been agitated by rumors,  each more wild than the next. Allegedly there have been several  assassination attempts, including on Ministry of Internal  Affairs officers, on the president of the Butya company, Bulat  Abilov, and on other famous people.    We called the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] press  service and found out that these rumors were not news to them.    "We know of this," said the deputy chief of the MVD press  center, Lieutenant Colonel Aleksandr Vulf. "This information is  not true, however. All the persons whose names are being  mentioned in 'unofficial chronicles' are alive and well."    "Nevertheless, residents of the capital noticed, for  instance, unusual activism on the part of the militia over the  past few days. Why?"    Vulf said: In the past the militia has always worked in a  special mode during holidays. The same was true over the past  few days: The militia was put on a round-the-clock operation  schedule, with reinforced patrols--that is why there was more  special equipment on the streets than usual, and patrols were  armed with submachine guns. This is not at all related to a  crime surge. On the contrary, over the past four months the  total number of crimes in the republic has dropped by 7 percent,  and criminal investigations--by 10 percent. The number of  murders, robberies, and assaults has dropped. In order to  maintain this trend, the republic organs of internal affairs  conducted Operation "Kuryk" ("Noose") a few days ago. Over a  period of three days 1,288 crimes were registered, of which 888  were solved while the trail was hot. We also detained 1,153  suspects--63 for inflicting grave bodily harm, 92--for  hooliganism, and 21--for assault. "Noose" also caught 252 drug  addicts, from whom we confiscated 22.5 kg of drugs. On the basis  of these facts, 1,069 criminal cases have been initiated.    In the course of the operation 633 units of firearms were  confiscated, 55 stolen cars were found, and 4,152 persons were  delivered to medical sobering-up facilities. We checked  dormitories, hotels, and "suspicious" apartments. It turned out  that 425 foreign citizens were living in Kazakhstan not only  without a residence permit but even without a passport. One  hundred thirteens persons were expelled from the republic.    These are the facts we were given at the MVD press center.  And at the offices of the Butya company we were told that Bulat  Abilov is in good health and actually is on a business trip to  Japan.    Of course, where there is smoke there is fire. But the  rumors surrounding the incident that took place on 5 May near  the famous Arasan bathhouse have taken on the appearance of a  smoke-screen: Rumor had it that one of the top officials in the  republic MVD died in a mafia score-settling incident.    In reality the incident was far more prosaic. At 2330  Colonel  A. Seitov, chief of the MVD criminal investigations department,  who lives near Imeni 28 Panfilov Soldiers Park, was taking his  dog for a walk as usual. This time his whole family had decided  to get a bit of fresh air: A. Seitov himself, and his wife, son,  and daughter-in-law. Some intoxicated young men, who were  "having fun" at a commercial kiosk near the bathhouse, took a  liking to the beautiful dog. Two of the six confronted the  family and pulled out a gun: "Give us the dog or we will kill  it."    Admonishments, verbal warnings, and even an MVD officer ID  produced no effect: The drunks continued to brandish their  weapon. Then the colonel pulled out his standard-issue weapon  and fired a warning shot in the air. Instead of coming back to  their senses, the drinkers attacked the colonel and wounded his  daughter- in-law. Then A. Seitov, too, used his weapon. One of  the attackers-- B. Alpysbayev, 30-year-old director of the  bathhouse men's department--was killed, and the other one was  wounded.    The procuracy initiated criminal proceedings against the  attackers. It was found that A. Seitov's use of a firearm had  been justified.    Thus, there was no "score-settling;" nevertheless, an attack  on, of all people, a top criminal investigations official is  indeed troublesome: After all, we mere mortals do not carry  standard-issue weapons for self-defense...</p>

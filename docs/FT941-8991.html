			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Assurance on Channel policing Public confidence in the Channel tunnel would be undermined if private-sector security organisations were given responsibility for counter-terrorist operations, Mr Frank Dobson, Labour's shadow transport secretary, said in the Commons last night. He urged the government to ensure that the British Transport Police would be in charge of security at passenger and freight terminals in the UK. Mr Roger Freeman, public transport minister, said the 'expertise and services' of British Transport Police would be at the disposal of those responsible for running trains through the Channel tunnel.</p>

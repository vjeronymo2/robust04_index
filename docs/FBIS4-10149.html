			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Tito Viru Polo] </F>   [Excerpt] Huacho, 25 Mar -- Six corrupt Peruvian National  Police [PNP] noncommissioned officers who illegally released  Clara Chumbe Rondono, aka Aunt Clara -- the most sought drug  trafficker in the northern region of Lima Department -- were  imprisoned last night in the Carquin jail located in Carquin. It  was reported that the corrupt PNP members received $10,000 for  allowing Rondono to go free. Rondono was arrested with 2 kg of  highly pure cocaine paste.    It has been learned that two other PNP officers were  reportedly involved in this case, but their names will not be  disclosed until the investigation that is being conducted is  completed and their involvement in this regrettable incident has  been clearly established. According to court investigations  under way, those arrested are members of the Huaral police  delegation, and participated in an antidrug operation conducted  in Huaral on 12 December 1993.

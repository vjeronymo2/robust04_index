			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Special Report On Residential Property (3): Storing some Welsh energy - A project that is part of the garden festival in Ebbw Vale THE MILLIONS who will tramp through the 142-acres of Garden Festival, Wales, in Ebbw Vale during the next five months will, among other things, see three of the most energy-efficient houses in the land. A mountain of more than 1.5m cubic metres of toxic slag from the valley's steelworks has been removed giving local residents an extra half hour of daylight. Good earth now replaces the slag, host to 300,000 trees, half a million shrubs and countless bedding plants. Ironically, British Steel (the cause of the original chronic pollution), is building one of the three houses in Green Street. British Gas is building another. The most efficient is the Catnic House, built by Custom Homes, based in Redhill, Surrey, a company that specialises in energy efficient timber-frame homes for self-builders. All three houses score above nine out of 10 in the government's new energy scale; well above the present minimum building regulation standard. The Custom Homes house scored 9.7 on the energy scale, achieved with 6in of insulation in the walls and 9in in the roof. Numerous other features - double-glazing, low-emission glass and a heat-recovery unit  - have all contributed to make this a home that is snug without fug. Christopher Heath, managing director, says: 'The extra cost involved in achieving this high efficiency was relatively small, below Pounds 2,500, when compared against the normal price of Pounds 132,000 for a home of this size.' Energy efficiency has become a significant factor in house-building. For decades the UK has lagged behind Scandinavian builders, but now the new British home can at least hold its own. The movement towards energy efficiency is an urgent one. Well over half the carbon dioxide emissions are the result of domestic use; a reduction is vital for our survival. Central heating alone produces more than 50m tons of carbon dioxide each year. Most house-builders continue to emphasise what the industry calls 'kerb appeal' - that is, houses that look good to go home to. Companies such as Laing Homes and Admiral Homes are leading the way among volume builders in providing homes that have kerb and wallet appeal. Admiral was the first to achieve a remarkable maximum energy efficiency rating of 10 with one of its houses; a fine achievement but (like the skating champion who scores six out of a possible six) one which leaves no room for improvement. Tours of homes in Scandinavia leave me with the impression that there is still room for greater efficiency - so the ludicrous situation of builders scoring 11 out of 10 could soon be with us. Laing Homes is to be congratulated for its 'green' initiatives in Cheam, London. Facilities at Cheam include bottle banks, water butts for irrigating the garden, low-energy lighting in the flats and communal areas. Not only do the flats at Woodland Rise achieve an energy efficiency score of 9.9, but residents also receive a copy of environmentalist Jonathon Porritt's book Save The Earth. Martin Laing, Laing Homes chairman, who is also UK chairman of the Worldwide Fund for Nature, has given environmental practice notes to his staff, suppliers and sub-contractors, covering such items as company cars and CFCs. The company builds predominantly on 'brown' land: land which has already been built on. As many trees and hedges are retained as possible. The Cheam flats cost from Pounds 46,000. At that price, many potential buyers may be green with envy.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unscheduled statement by Yemeni military source at the </F> Defense Ministry and General Staff Commands on 5 May -- read by  announcer]    [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate.  With the help of God and the resolve of brave men, the units of  valiant Armed Forces--the forces of unity and constitutional  legitimacy--in the Lahij, Abyan, al-Bayda', and Ta'izz  Governorates continue their confrontations and successive  offensives against the units of the forces of evil, wickedness,  and apostasy, which have been controlled and commanded by the  rebellious, separatist elements in the Socialist Party command  since they exploded the military situation in a comprehensive  manner last night, beginning with the Dhamar and Aden  Governorates, and extending to other governorates.    The forces of constitutional legitimacy--the defenders of  unity and democracy--have inflicted successive defeats on all  the units that have been pushed into this losing and destructive  battle. They forced a large number of those forces to surrender  to the will of the people, the power of truth, and the heroism  of the forces defending unity and democracy. Other units have  surrendered of their own free will, declaring that they have  joined the trenches of constitutional legitimacy and the ranks  of the defenders of the people and the homeland and their great  achievements.    This morning, units from the Ba Suhayb Brigade Camp were  forced to surrender and join the ranks of constitutional  legitimacy and Yemeni unity.    With the same spirit of defending unity and democracy and  defeating the forces of treachery, apostasy, and separation, the  forces of the 2d Armored Brigade in the al-Rahah area continue  their great steadfastness, warding off all the fires of rancor,  which will be defeated, God willing.    In the al-Bayda' and Abyan Governorates, the forces of the  56th Brigade, 3d Armored Brigade, the 8th Special Forces  Brigade, and the al-Wahdah Brigades continue their determined,  capable advance as they confront the forces of separation in the  Mukayris area. They encircled and seized the 20th Brigade and  all its fortifications.    In the same spirit aiming at bolstering the people's unity  victory and defeating their treacherous enemies, the supported  [muda'am] 3d Infantry Brigade confronted the forces of apostasy  and separation in the camps of the al-Rahidah and Sarif areas.  They are now continuing their heroic and valiant advance to  achieve their mission.    In the city of Aden, our valiant heroes at the Central  Security Company in Khormaksar have continued their unique  heroic steadfastness in the face of the fierce large-scale  aggression carried out against them by a number of the rebelling  military units.    In the Ibb Governorate, the forces of the constitutional  legitimacy and Yemeni unity have continued their attack on the  units and brigades of the forces of apostasy and secession in  the al-Dali' region. The forces of the al-Hamzah Camp inflicted  heavy losses on the 'Abbud Brigade forces. Fighting is still  raging and the treacherous ones, aggressors, and those rebelling  against the constitutional legitimacy, of the enemies of the  people and unity, will receive their punishment.    Ever since last night, the al-'Amaliqah forces have been  heroically confronting the sea and air attacks against them in  the Abyan Governorate. They were able to repulse these attacks  and prevent them from achieving any of their objectives.    This morning, the capital, Sanaa, and the cities of Ta'izz  and al-Hudaydah witnessed air raids by the aircraft of the  rebelling secessionist forces, which targeted some vital and  strategic installations. These raids also targeted a number of  the military brigades in some governorates. The units of the  air defense forces confronted them and downed two aircraft  belonging to the rebelling secessionist gang in the al-Rahah  region, two aircraft in Mukayris, and another aircraft in  al-Rahidah.    Last night and this morning, large numbers of officers,  noncommissioned officers, and soldiers willingly handed  themselves over to the forces of the constitutional legitimacy,  announcing that they want to join these forces, and voicing  their rejection of the despicable secessionist conspiracy which  was hatched by the secessionist gang in the leadership of the  Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], headed by war criminal, traitor,  'Ali Salim al-Bid and his evil secessionist clique, against the  homeland and its unity, and against the people, their freedom,  and democracy. The expressed their denunciation of all the  criminal acts which resulted in this comprehensive military war  which was ignited by this rebelling clique, which will be  crushed, God willing.    In a subsequent statement, we will detail the names of these  units and the number of the officers, noncommissioned officers,  and soldiers who joined the forces of the constitutional  legitimacy and the trench of the Yemeni unity, the party of the  one Yemeni people, which is above all the sick parochial,  personal, and selfish loyalties, because it is the people's army  whose loyalty is to God, the homeland, the revolution, the  unity, and democracy.</p>

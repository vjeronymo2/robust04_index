			<p>BFN     [Text] Senator Danilo Astori has placed his position as  provisional head of the Broad Front (FA) at the disposal of his  FA executive board colleagues because it is his understanding  that this post must be occupied by a consensus FA candidate.  Mariano Arana, Montevideo mayoral candidate, will occupy  Astori's post.    Astori himself told EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO that on 19 May  he  would launch an "independent" movement that would not involve a  restoration of Communist Party factions.    The senator explained that his decision was based on "two  reasons" closely linked to his decision to head an independent  politico-electoral alternative within the FA.    Astori emphasized: "I am no longer a consensus candidate."  He  added that in his opinion "consensus candidates must be included  in the coalition's executive board during the current  (electoral) stage."    Participants in yesterday's FA provisional executive board  meeting told EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO that Astori expressed his  willingness to continue working on common FA tasks for the  November elections.    The other 11 FA executive board members "lauded the  political  tactfulness" of the former FA vice presidential candidate, and  pointed out that they would contact their sectors to formally  come to a decision on Astori's proposal.    Astori announced that he would launch on 19 May at the El  Galpon theater an "independent FA" group, which he will head.  During the launching ceremony he will present an initial  "proposals document" that "will explain the characteristics of  this political project."    The legislator explained: "It is not a restoration of  Communist Party factions. It is not a coming together of groups,  nor is it meant as a way to exclude people. It is much more than  that. It is a long-term and absolutely pluralistic and open  project for the FA independents, regardless of their origin."</p>

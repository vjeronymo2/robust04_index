			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Observer: Welsh players Time to place your bets on the likely successor to the Welsh Development Agency's current chairman Gwyn Jones, who has surprised everyone by celebrating his 44th birthday with the announcement that he is quitting one of the most powerful jobs in Wales. Much fancied to replace him is geologist Roy Bichan, whose North Wales geology group, Robertson, was taken over by Simon Engineering last year. Strength: a successful businessman. Weakness: an Orcadian by birth, Leeds by training, Welsh only by adoption. Contrariwise, Welsh by birth albeit English by adoption is surveyor Sir Idris Pearce, chairman of English Estates now about to be absorbed into the Urban Regeneration Agency. The fact that he'll be deputy chairman there to former secretary for Wales Lord Walker must be seen a strength. So must Pearce's closeness to the Tories. Another similarly close is Cardiff's Thomas 'the Insurance', who sold his business for mega-money to Sedgwick Jackson. Bonus point: Brian Thomas served as electioneering chauffeur to present secretary for Wales David Hunt, who has just put him on the board of another quango supervising the development of Cardiff Bay. Far more an outsider is Gareth Davies, boss of Midlands engineers Glynwed. While his political form isn't known, he is Welsh-born and has a clutch of non-executive directorships. Moreover an agency insider has been heard to say: 'What we need is someone with investment links, access to cash and knowledge of how international business works.' Gareth Davies could fit the bill.</p>

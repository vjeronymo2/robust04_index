			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 27 (KCNA) -- A solidarity meeting  supporting the just cause of the Korean people was held in  Kathmandu on June 18.    Chairman of the Nepal Workers and Peasants Party Narayan Man  Bijukchhe declared at the meeting: "We will extend invariable  support to the government and the people of the Democratic  People's Republic of Korea in all their efforts for the peace  and security of the Korean peninsula and its denuclearisation."  Manik Lal Shrestha, chairman of the Nepal-Korea Friendship  Association, noted that the "resolution" adopted at the board of  governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] is a  prelude to the "sanctions" of the United Nations against the  DPRK and virtually a declaration of war. He fully supported the  Korean people who gave a decisive answer to the unjustifiable  "step" of the IAEA. Member of parliament Shibash Nembag, said:  "It is our duty, morality and conscience to extend militant  support and solidarity to the fraternal Korean people. The  Korean people and the world's peaceloving people will surely  frustrate the moves of the imperialists and defend their just  cause".    A letter to the great leader President Kim Il-song was  adopted at the meeting.</p>

			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Arts: Black comedy spirals out of control - Cinema BARTON FINK (15) Lumiere, Gate Notting Hill, Screen on the Hill THE FAVOUR, THE WATCH AND THE VERY BIG FISH (15) Odean Haymarket STAR TREK VI (PG) Empire SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS (U) MGM Trocadero, Cannons West End Writers have never recovered from being evicted by time and social progress from the garrets they see as their natural habitats. Many still seek castigatory environments even when, in the age of arts subsidies and social welfare, comfort is within their reach. Take the hero of Joel and Ethan Coen's Barton Fink, a black comedy about madness that won the top prize, and several others, last year at Cannes. Playwright Fink (John Turturro) has come to Hollywood after his latest Broadway success - Bare Ruined Choirs, 'a simple tale of fishmongers' - and is now holed up at the faded, majestic Hotel Earle. The time is the 1940s when the cinema became a great provider, a welfare state by another name, to every serious writer willing to slum it for a few months in Tinseltown. When not discussing his screenwriting future with the fat studio head (Michael Lerner combining LB Mayer with Jack Warner) and the thin, alcoholic novelist teaching him the ropes (John Mahoney doing a William Faulkner), Fink is marooned in his mouldering hotel room with writer's block. The typewriter, though seldom struck, beats a deafening tattoo when it is. Fink's neighbour (John Goodman) is genial on the surface, psychotic just beneath. Mosquitoes whine like insect Eumenides. And the wallpaper is coming away from the wall stickily, audibly, nastily, like flesh from an early religious martyr. Ah yes, but is the place falling apart? Is the neighbour mad? Is the wallpaper in need of attention? Or is Fink himself, fright-haired and pop-eyed in his steel-rim spectacles, a few cards short of a full deck? Initially inspired by Clifford Odets, this lost-in-Hollywood left-winger is turned by the Coens into a joke-archetypal writer who expressionistically appropriates every new world he moves into. Though not told explicitly through Fink's eyes, the scenes inside and outside the hotel both aspire to a mildly deranged surrealism. The Coen-esque world of Raising Arizona and Miller's Crossing, where daft events are delivered with a piercing sobriety, is here given a subjective pretext by the dotty sensibility of the main character. But rather than legitimising the Coen style, this ends up devaluing it. Barton Fink swept the board at Cannes, one suspects, because Roman Polanski was jury president. Here was a film after Mr P's own heart: a Repulsion or Cul De Sac for the 1990s, turning clinical claustrophobia into high black comedy. But Polanski's films had an intensity and a savage cutting edge. Barton Fink plays increasingly like a series of hit-and-miss sketches dreamt up by two film-makers doodling between assignments. Michael Lerner's studio chief is a hit: a human super-blob who alternates between apoplexy and ingratiation. (Foot-kissing of screenwriters is a speciality.) But Lerner's scenes could belong to a different film from the neo-Gothic ones involving Goodman - inspired as if by Kubrick's The Shining  -or the subplot romance with Judy Davis, who plays novelist's moll to the Faulkner character and ends up as a corpse between Fink's sheets. As with many films that spiral out of control, accumulation replaces momentum. When murder, arson and dementia take over in the last reel, we feel the same sense of jaded bemusement as when a horror film, running out of anything further to up, sets fire to the ogre's mansion, hurls the escaping hero(ine) into the open air, lashes the orchestra's string section into overdrive and cranes up to view the aesthetic shambles with the clemency of distance. There is no mercy even in distance for The Favour, The Watch And The Very Big Fish. Adapted by Anglo-Australian writer-director Ben Lewin from a story by France's Marcel Ayme, this is a Euro-pudding that should never have left the mixing bowl. Where, to begin with, are we? Paris is the nominal setting and France is the country of origin for most of the supporting cast. Yet the stars are Anglo-American (Bob Hoskins, Jeff Goldblum, Natasha Richardson) and the dialogue is out of Ionesco by a French-English phrasebook. As for the plot - something about a photographer (Hoskins) employed by a religious artefacts shop who falls in love with a pretty actress (Richardson) and finds his perfect Christ model in her one-time ex-convict lover (Goldblum) - it aims at a deadpan farcical tone, a sort of Gallic Fish Called Wanda, and misses by a continent. Bemused by the choppy editing and Franglais dialogue, I never once believed in the romantic electricity supposedly taking place between Richardson and Mr Hoskins, here sporting a posh accent, a moustache and a very big fish. This last, featured in only one scene, is put through a mincer by Hoskins's cordon bleu sister. Do not ask me why. Elsewhere I recall two funny moments - a dog attacking a stuffed lion and a porno film voice-dubbing session - and many more moments of stupefaction shading into somnolence. I was on red alert throughout Star Trek VI. Warp-speeding through the galaxies with Kirk, Bones, Scotty, Spocky and the rest of them, we thrill to another plot in which the evil Klingons menace decent humanity. This time their bankrupt empire is suing for peace and their chancellor Gorkon (David Warner as a galactic Gorbachev) is assassinated en route to the United Federation of Planets. Was his ship blown up by the Enterprise? Klingon nasty Christopher Plummer thinks so and so he ships Kirk and Bones off to Klingon Siberia. From this wintry hell on a far-flung planet we are told that 'No one ever escaped': which means our heroes take ten minutes rather than five to do so. Meanwhile, back on the Enterprise, only a missing pair of gravity boots can help Spock find the true culprits and prove his masters' innocence . . . Never mind gravity boots. As the spaced-out saga clocks up its 25th year, I am concerned about all those gravity toupees. William Shatner's Kirk wears a grey and curly number, while Bones favours a youthful sideways-with-parting and Spock sports that unchanging jet-black fringe set off by twitching bat ears. We have never seen so many attempts to conceal advancing empty-headeness with advanced cranial foliage. Star Trek VI itself is a piece of shameless let-your-hair-down camp. Rife with idiot charm, it rejoices in lines like 'You've not experienced Shakespeare until you've read him in the original Klingon' (Plummer to Kirk) and 'There's an old Vulcan proverb: 'Only Nixon could go to China'' (Spock to anyone still listening). Director Nicholas Meyer, on his third trekkie outing, seems as happily confused as the rest of us over ranks and titles. (I thought Kirk was an Admiral the last time round? And when was Spock promoted to Captain?) But undeterred he hurls jokes, explosions and special effects at us as if there were no tomorrow. For this cast we are sadly told there may not be. In the closing credits the stars literally sign off - pink autographs enscrolled on a galactic background - and another generation, says the over-voice, will soon boldly go 'where no man - no one - has gone before.' Ah, Political Correctness. Not even the battle-scarred Enterprise can resist the onslaught of that. Finally, Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs is back. Heaven knows what the PC brigade have to say about this. Here we have an overprivileged Wasp debutante establishing sway over a group of socially deprived mineworkers of reduced stature. Still, the songs are good. And the animation, after 50 years, is matchless.</p>

			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Yeltsin retreats to dacha for surprise holiday MR BORIS YELTSIN, the Russian president, suddenly decided yesterday to take a 12-day break from official duties and cancelled all engagements with foreign visitors. However, talks scheduled with Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the speaker of the Supreme Soviet, on the contentious issue of a referendum in April 11 on a new constitution, may go ahead. Mr Yeltsin's decision to seclude himself in his official dacha caught Moscow's political establishment by surprise and left a question mark over his reasons. Ill health was ruled out, though he was admitted to be tired. This is not the first time Mr Yeltsin has suddenly quit his Kremlin duties but it will be one of the longest. Shortly after Mr Yeltsin's statement, Mr Khasbulatov appeared to concede his opposition to a referendum, one of the main points of contention between the two men which they failed to resolve during discussions last Thursday. Though both Mr Yeltsin's and Mr Khasbulatov's intentions were shrouded in their habitual ambiguity, what does seem clear is that the deepening power struggle has not been alleviated. Mr Khasbulatov has been opposed to the referendum and may be hoping to sink it under the weight of additional questions. He told a session of the praesidium of the parliament that he 'supported the idea of the president' to prepare a second ballot paper with a range of questions on whether the Russian citizens trusted the president, the permanent Supreme Soviet, the full Congress of People's Deputies and the Russian government. Mr Yeltsin had originally said the referendum should be about trust when he proposed the idea last December. Mr Khasbulatov also said that elections should be held in spring for 'all the highest bodies of power' - presumably including the parliament and the president. He said that the inclusion of the further questions would 'ensure the attendance of citizens at the referendum' and show 'the sincerity of our intentions'. Although government ministers have consistently backed the idea of a referendum to bring clarity into a situation where most important legislation is bounced to and fro between government, presidency and parliament between increasingly hostile sessions of the Congress of People's Deputies, there is still no clear idea of how the referendum would be phrased. Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, the first deputy prime minister who has been put in charge of the referendum campaign, said yesterday that the president had not decided which questions should be asked. Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister, said a referendum should be held on a constitution only after a constituent assembly had prepared a draft referendum.

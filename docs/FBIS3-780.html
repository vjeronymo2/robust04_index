			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Robert Brand] </F>   [Text] Right-wing unity is under renewed pressure in the  wake of the Bophuthatswana crisis, with the Afrikaner  Weerstandsbeweging [Resistance Movement -- AWB] considering  pulling out of the far-right umbrella organisation, the  Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front -- AVF].    Bitter accusations were flung at AVF leader General Constand  Viljoen for his role in the AWB's disastrous retreat from  Mmabatho yesterday.    AWB spokesman Fred Rundle said he would be most unhappy to  remain in alliance with Viljoen. "We don't trust him," he said.    "We are very disillusioned and disappointed with the role  General Viljoen played in Bophuthatswana. He has no credibility  left with our people," an angry Rundle said from the AWB's  Ventersdorp office yesterday.    About 4,000 AWB members pulled out of Mmabatho yesterday  after being requested by Viljoen to leave the territory. During  the retreat three AWB members were shot dead, apparently in cold  blood, by members of the Bophuthatswana Defence Force. A  further five AWB members were wounded in skirmishes.    But Rundle denied that AWB members had been involved in  clashes with members of the Bophuthatswana security forces and  said the organisation had not been chased out of Mmabatho. "Our  people left because we were asked to leave."    He said Mangope had personally asked AWB leader Eugene  Terreblanche for assistance to stabilise the situation in  Mmabatho. "President Mangope personally had discussions with our  leader, and asked for his help."    The Bophuthatswana government has denied this, saying it had  asked Viljoen for assistance on condition the AWB would not be  involved.    Asked whether the AWB would remain a member of the AVF,  Rundle said: "We will settle that at our next meeting. I am a  member of the AVF's executive council and I, for one, would be  most unhappy to remain a member if General Viljoen is there.    Viljoen was not available for comment late yesterday.</p>

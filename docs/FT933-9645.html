			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / Fowler seeks to protect party agents THE CONSERVATIVE party is conducting an urgent review of ways of improving job security for its network of constituency agents, many of whom have been made redundant since the last general election, held in April last year. Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman, has written to constituency chairmen asking to be informed beforehand if they are contemplating making an agent redundant. Conservative Central Office is understood to be keen to start an early-warning system so that alternatives for saving money can first be explored with constituency associations. Next year's elections for councils and the European parliament have assumed a greater than usual significance in the light of the question mark hanging over the leadership of Mr John Major. The party can therefore ill afford too great an exodus of agents - the permanent officials responsible for campaigning, fund-raising and local organisation. Central Office said yesterday that the party still had agents in the majority of Conservative-held marginal seats. It is expected to continue to help pay for agents in marginal seats in the run-up to general elections. Sir Norman has emphasised in the past that redundancies among agents are to be expected in the aftermath of general elections and that the party still has more such officials than Labour and the Liberal Democrats combined. In a letter to The Times last month he said the party now had more agents in the constituencies than it did 18 months before the last general election.</p>

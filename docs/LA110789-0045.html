The United  Nations deployed 1,200 poll watchers in an effort to ensure a fair election.  The South-West Africa People's Organization is expected to outpoll nine other  parties in the vote. South Africans will be watching the election as a  bellwether of political steps toward majority rule.  </P></p>

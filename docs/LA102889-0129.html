			<p><P> October 28, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GAGAU SCORES TWO TOUCHDOWNS IN LA QUINTA ROUT  </P> <P> La Quinta High School kept its playoff hopes alive Friday night, trouncing  Santiago, 34-0, before a homecoming crowd at Bolsa Grande.  </P> <P> Keeping with a "Looney Tunes" homecoming theme, the Aztecs (4-4, 3-2) dropped a  refrigerator on the Cavaliers (2-6, 1-4) as 6-foot-3, 318-pound Sunny Gagau  scored two touchdowns to help keep La Quinta tied for third in the Garden Grove  league.  </P> <P> Gagau's first score came early in the second quarter when he scooped up a  Cavalier fumble and then ran 55 yards for a touchdown giving La Quinta a 20-0  lead.  </P> <P> On La Quinta's next possession, after moving to the Santiago 12, La Quinta  Coach Roger Takahashi put Gagau into the backfield where he passed to Walter  Dawkins off a halfback option play to extend the lead to 27-0.  </P> <P> "Sunny is a great athlete," Takahashi said, "it was just a little twist off the  pitch play."

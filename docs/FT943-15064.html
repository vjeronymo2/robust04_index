			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Kim's death poses problems for Japan The Japanese government yesterday expressed its support for continued efforts to encourage North Korea to be open about its nuclear programme following the death of President Kim Il-sung. Mr Kozo Igarashi, chief cabinet secretary, said: 'We will call on North Korea not to retreat from its efforts to resolve the issue through dialogue.' The official Japanese reaction to the death of Mr Kim has so far been one of extreme caution, as the government tries to gauge developments in North Korea. Last night, on his return from the Group of Seven summit in Naples, Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama met senior cabinet colleagues to review developments. Mr Yohei Kono, deputy prime minister and foreign minister, has already cancelled a visit to South America next week, and it seems likely that Mr Murayama will postpone a visit he was due to make to Seoul this weekend. The uncertainty in Pyongyang poses difficulties for the new coalition government headed by the Social Democratic party (SDP) and Liberal Democratic party (LDP). The SDP has long had a close relationship with the (North) Korean Workers' party, and the coalition has been leaning towards a more conciliatory policy than its predecessor. SDP leaders expressed regret that Mr Kim had died so soon before his planned summit meeting with South Korean President Kim Young Sam. The party's secretary-general, Mr Wataru Kubo, a key member of the government, said: 'The SDP, as a party that has pledged co-operation in improving relations between Japan and North Korea, heartily offers condolences to the Korean Workers' party.' He expressed hope for the peaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula. North Korean residents in Japan were in mourning yesterday. Mr Li Jin-gyu, the vice-chairman of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan, angrily denied rumours circulating in Tokyo that Mr Kim's death might be part of an attempted coup, saying such reports were 'demagoguery that deserved no attention. The Korean people admire President Kim from the bottom of their hearts. Our country will further achieve brilliant development under Secretary Kim Jong-il.' The Japanese North Korean community is the largest outside the socialist state and is an important source of finance for the country. Japan's internal security forces were said to have stepped up monitoring of the association in the wake of Mr Kim's death.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aydyn Mekhtiyev report in the "Settlement" column: </F> "Russia's Karabakh Policy Does Not Suit the Opposition.  Statement by 10 Deputies of the Russian Federation State Duma"]    [Text] Ten deputies of the Russian Federation State Duma  have come out with a statement criticizing government policy  over the settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijan conflict.  "Supported by the Russian government and using the conflict  around Nagorno-Karabakh, Armenian military forces have occupied  14,000 sq km of Azerbaijan territory, evicting more than half a  million residents, emerging as the main source of aggression in  the Caucasus," stresses the document signed by, among others,  opposition deputies Sergey Baburin, Aleksandr Nevzorov, and  Anatoliy Lukyanov.    The statement maintains that, against the eventuality of the  Azerbaijan leadership's refusing to approve the Russian peace  plan, Armenian military formations are preparing an assault on  the city of Gyandzha while "Armenian military forces are  incapable of conducting such offensive operations without direct  support from the Russian Federation Defense Ministry."    The authors of the statement believe it necessary in the  very  near future to hear at a State Duma session reports by the  Russian Federation defense and foreign ministers to learn "to  what extent the policy pursued by them in the zone of the  Armenian-Azerbaijan conflict corresponds to Russia's national  interests."    It is noteworthy that prior to the statement a State Duma  delegation led by Russian Path deputies' group coordinator  Sergey Baburin visited Baku where it held negotiations with the  Azerbaijan government. Although the statement was signed by  only 10 deputies (mainly representatives of the Russian National  Union), it can be assumed that communist and agrarian factions  in the Russian parliament will support the charges made against  the Chernomyrdin government. The Liberal Democratic Party of  Russia faction will hardly join this statement because Vladimir  Volfovich [Zhirinovskiy] has repeated accused Azerbaijan of  infringing Armenians' rights.    As for the State Duma committees, they have not as yet  worked  out a common approach to the Karabakh problem. State Duma  Security Committee chairman Viktor Ilyukhin has signed "the  statement of 10." At the same time the State Duma Committee on  International Affairs so far tends to support President'  Yeltsin's policy in the Karabakh conflict. Committee Chairman  Vladimir Lukin, in the course of recent negotiations with  Azerbaijan parliament speaker Rasul Guliyev, sought to persuade  him to accept the peace plan prepared in Smolenskaya Square.    As far as concerns talks between Baku and Moscow on terms  for  Azerbaijan's accession to the Moscow 17 May protocol, it is so  far difficult to say that a definite accord will be reached. On  Saturday in Moscow talks were held behind closed doors between  Russian Federation and Azerbaijan Defense Ministers Pavel  Grachev and Mamedraf Mamedov. An informed source in the  Azerbaijan Defense Ministry told NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's  correspondent that in the course of the meeting Mamedov stated  that a condition for Azerbaijan's signing the document is the  inclusion into the text of the protocol of an exact date for  Armenian troop withdrawal from the occupied territories. Baku  believes that the Armenian side must start the withdrawal, not  after both sides pull out their troops from the current front  line but simultaneously with it. The Russian minister agreed  with Baku's arguments. The sides agreed to continue  consultations after Grachev's return from his trip to the NATO  headquarters in Brussels.    The haste with which Russian generals are going to introduce  peacekeeping forces in Azerbaijan suggests that Moscow is not  particularly interested in seeing the CSCE Minsk group join the  peace process. On 16 May Grachev told journalists that the  Russian defense department will not wait for the arrival in the  region of international observers but will be acting according  to its own plan. Such a statement seems to be at odds with the  accord about coordinating Moscow's and the CSCE's efforts on  this issue reached between Russian Federation Foreign Affairs  Minister Andrey Kozyrev and head of the CSCE Minsk group Ian  Iliasson. At the end of last week the U.S. Administration  warned Moscow indirectly about the impermissibility of  conducting a peacekeeping operation in Nagorno- Karabakh without  coordination with the CSCE and the UN.    U.S. Ambassador to Azerbaijan Richard Kauzlarich made the  following statement in Baku: Any plan for resolving the  Karabakh problem, including a Russian plan, must be executed  within the CSCE Minsk group framework... The introduction of  CIS disengagement forces into the region must proceed under the  supervision of international observers.</p>

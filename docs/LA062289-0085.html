			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLLUTION CONTROLS PROPOSED FOR OIL RIGS  </P> <P> The federal government has proposed a new regulation that would require many  oil platforms in the Santa Barbara Channel to install cleaner-burning  generators in order to reduce air pollution.  </P> <P> But officials in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties and environmental groups  say the regulation does not go far enough toward improving onshore air  pollution problems, and they may sue if the regulation is approved by the  Department of the Interior.  </P> <P> Ventura County officials, along with their Santa Barbara counterparts and  environmental groups, have fought for years to make offshore oil-drilling  operations subject to the same clean air regulations as onshore industries. It  has been an uphill battle because county officials have no direct control over  offshore emissions, which are regulated by the Minerals Management Service, a  division of the Department of the Interior.  </P> <P> That may change, however. The brewing debate in Congress over the Clean Air Act  may mean that jurisdiction over offshore emissions will be transfered from the  Interior Department to the federal Environmental Protection Agency, which may  be more sympathetic to the county's position.  </P> <P> </P> <P> In a Bind  </P> <P> Local officials have long complained that conflicting federal requirements put  them in a bind. On one hand, the EPA requires them to count offshore emissions  as part of the Ventura County air pollution problem. But on the other hand,  because of the Interior Department's jurisdiction, the county has little  control over the offshore sources of pollution. The result, officials say, is  likely to be ever-tighter pollution controls onshore to make up for the  offshore emissions.  </P> <P> "When we're sitting here imposing controls that have the effect of reducing  emissions one-tenth of one ton per day and they're out there putting out tons  per day, they're hurting the gains we're making," said Richard Baldwin,  executive officer of the county Air Pollution Control District. However, the  oil industry disputes the claim that offshore pollution significantly affects  onshore air quality.  </P> <P> Offshore oil drilling creates air pollution mostly from the large power  generators used to run drilling rigs and pumps. Though similar engines are  subject to strict regulations onshore, the Minerals Management Service did not  regulate offshore air pollution until 1980. Since then, the agency has required  pollution-control measures on offshore platforms around the country if computer  air-quality models show that offshore emissions contribute to onshore air  pollution problems. These measures have included clean-burning gas turbines,  sulfur recovery units and waste-heat recovery systems, which reduce the size of  generators needed on the platforms.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Separate Standards  </P> <P> Since 1982, the state and environmentalists have been engaged in litigation  with the Interior Department to force a separate set of tougher offshore air  pollution standards for California. As part of this litigation, officials from  local, state and federal agencies, along with oil company representatives and  environmentalists, engaged in secret negotiations for more than two years.  However, the negotiations broke down in late 1988.  </P> <P> Then in January, the Interior Department issued a proposed new regulation for  California offshore pollution. Under the proposal, offshore platforms emitting  air pollutants above a certain level would have to install pollution control  technologies in all circumstances, no matter what the computer modeling  indicated.  </P> <P> Oil industry officials say the rule would go too far. "It would be very  difficult to live with," said Donna Black, an attorney for the Western States  Petroleum Assn. However, she added, "I wouldn't go so far as to say that, under  this proposed rule, nobody would be able to do anything."  </P> <P> But the new regulation is not as strict as present onshore regulations. For  example, offshore facilities must install equipment to reduce emissions of  so-called "ozone precursors" -- gases that help create smog -- only if they  produce more than 46 tons per year, while Ventura County's present threshold  for onshore facilities is 25 tons per year. Ozone smog is Ventura County's  major air pollution problem, and regulation of ozone precursors is the major  technique used to reduce local pollution both onshore and offshore.  </P> <P> "At a minimum, the regulation should control offshore areas the same way  onshore areas are controlled," said Mark Abramowitz, director of the Santa  Monica-based Coalition for Clean Air, who led environmentalists in the  negotiation effort.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Area of Jurisdiction  </P> <P> The proposed regulation specifically steers clear of the pollution emissions  created by crew and supply boats that serve the rigs, which a recent study has  identified as part of the problem. "We don't feel we have the jurisdiction to  regulate crew and supply boats while they're in transit," said Mitchell Baer, a  Minerals Management meteorologist who wrote the proposed regulation.  </P> <P> So far, Minerals Management has received a stack of comments on the proposed  regulation at least 10 feet high. Baldwin said that if the final rule is  similar to the proposal, he will probably recommend that the county sue to make  it tougher. The Interior Department has no timetable for issuing a final  regulation.  </P></p>

			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / WEU armada 'aimed at the wrong target' THE decision by the nine-member Western European Union (WEU) to send warships to the Adriatic to enforce sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro, is more a political than a military move, it was admitted yesterday. Mr Relus Ter Beek, the Dutch defence minister, said sending forces to the Adriatic was 'a political decision in the sense that we cannot enter the ships, we cannot force them to stop, we cannot control their cargoes. All we can do is monitor. It is a political gesture aimed at applying more pressure on (Serbian president Slobodan) Milosevic.' Attempts to enforce sanctions by patrolling the Adriatic would only be effective if it were followed up by other measures. 'If the United Nations Security Council decides to really enforce the embargo against Serbia, then it seems to me that surveillance along the Danube is the first priority,' said Mr Willem van Eekelen, WEU secretary general. Diplomats at the CSCE summit said most of the sanctions-busting was taking place along the river Danube. Both here and on the Adriatic, the UN had not set up any mechanism to monitor the flow of goods in or out of Serbia when it imposed sanctions against Belgrade on May 31. 'We simply have not got the manpower,' the UN says. British and Italian businessmen who have temporarily closed their offices in Belgrade, said sanctions busting was taking place in a number of areas. These include: The port of Bar in Montenegro. Goods were being shipped across the Adriatic to Bar and then transported by train or lorry to Serbia. 'That port, like Belgrade, is packed with mafia gangs who are making money out of the sanctions and growing shortages in Belgrade,' a British engineer said. The port of Constanta in Romania. Oil, and possibly even weapons, are getting through to Serbia via Romania. 'I am not saying that Romania is sanctions busting. What I am saying is that Yugoslavia has a large fleet of barges - about a dozen. They dock at the Romanian port of Constanta,' a western oil exporter said. 'No international body is patrolling the Danube. With backhanders, and zilch monitoring of invoices and end-users, goods can get through to Belgrade,' he added. The Yugoslav fleet has very close links with Genex, the giant Belgrade-based foreign trade company. Mr Milosevic has practically controlled Genex since his rise to power in 1987 when he started placing his supporters in the top echelons of the company. 'Genex knows what trade and business is all about. It knows how to avoid getting caught,' said a British exporter. Arms sales. Western and eastern European diplomats said a UN and European Community arms embargo was being breached. According to a US diplomat, since Croatia's independence was recognised last January, 'tons of weapons have gone into Croatia, by air, or maybe via Austria. The controls are far too lax. It would not surprise me if some of the republics of the former Soviet Union are shipping weapons to Serbia up through the Danube.' Air space. General Ratko Mladic, the head of Serbia's proxy army in Bosnia, and Mr Radovan Karadzic, the nationalist head of Bosnia's Serbs, fly to Belgrade on Yugoslav army helicopters, and helicopters are used for supplies from Serbia to Bosnia. Western military attaches yesterday said the time had not yet arrived for closing down Yugoslavia's internal air space. 'It would need a security council resolution, and an agreement on who would monitor the air space,' a Dutch diplomat said. He added that the decision by the WEU to send ships to the Adriatic was a first step. 'It will not stop the killing. But the WEU has taken responsibility in contributing towards making the UN sanctions more effective,' he said.</p>

			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Survey of Korean Financial Markets (5): Profitability strained - The problems faced by foreign bankers WHILE foreign brokers moan about the ceiling on foreign share ownership, foreign bankers in Korea have their own gripes. The controlled interest rate environment makes it hard for them to compete for business. Wage costs have spiralled in recent years and labour relations are worsening. The government requires bank branches to put up substantial capital, which reduces their profitability. And the economic slowdown has led to greater credit problems. Most foreign banks in Korea are involved primarily in the corporate banking sector. According to official figures, the total assets of foreign banks accounted for 10 per cent of the market, or Won16,914bn last year. However, their market share in deposit-taking is minuscule - around 1.4 per cent of the total, or Won869bn. Most of the foreign banks' business is with Korean companies, and consists of short-term credits, often related to trade finance. There is also relatively limited foreign exchange business. However, these markets should grow as the interest rate environment is deregulated over the next few years. Because of the current lack of a liberalised lending market, the bank market is supplemented by a so-called 'kerb' market. The kerb market is a source of funds lent often by wealthy individuals to small-size businesses which find it difficult to borrow from banks. The reason it is so hard for them to persuade the banks to lend is that banks are only allowed to charge rates within a restricted range, which discourages banks from lending to weaker credits. 'There is not a free market,' said one banker. 'Banks are given 'guidance' not to charge above a certain rate. Foreign banks are profitable but it is by using up capital from head office, because branches have to be heavily capitalised. The Bank of Korea assumes capital is free but it's not.' In fact, the profitability of foreign banks is difficult to assess because some banks are charged by their head office for the cost of capital, while others are not. 'A lot of the profitability of banks is just the differential between Libor  -the assumed funding cost for the capital - and returns on assets,' said one banker. In addition, banks have experienced an increase in bad debt over the past two years, as a growing number of Korean businesses have failed. The strains on profitability have brought to a halt the flow of arrivals of foreign banks into the country. Foreign banks currently number 52. 'With labour costs and other aspects of the operating environment, commercial bank entry will be very slow,' said Paul Muther, general manager of the First National Bank of Chicago and head of the Foreign Bankers Group. He said this year was an important one for the bank. 'We have reached a crossroads in the profit dynamics'. Higher wage costs and flat revenues mean that profits are falling. 'Broadly speaking, a typical foreign bank branch in 1992-3 is generating approximately the same revenue as five-years ago - but the cost of unionised staff has gone up roughly 100 per cent,' Mr Muther said. Bankers believe a spate of labour problems that have taken place this year is something which could pose a threat to their future. Disputes at ABN Amro and the Bank of Boston have been settled but a strike at Citibank continues and trouble is brewing at Bank of America, Banque Nationale de Paris, Banque Paribas and Standard Chartered. With the exception of Citibank, where the dispute concerns an employee welfare fund, the other strikes are all based on pay claims. These claims often run into double figures. Foreign bankers argue that their industry cannot sustain these types of pay increases, and that the net result of the high pay claims is that those foreign banks already in the market have stopped expanding their operations and other banks have been discouraged from entering the market at all. 'Unless we can get employee compensation under control, there is no future to the business,' Mr Muther said. Most foreign banks are involved only in corporate banking, and eschew the even more difficult retail market. The exception is Citibank, which has 11 branches in Korea. According to John Beeman, country corporate officer of Citibank, the retail banking strategy for Citibank in Asia is 'sharply focused. The nationwide banks have several hundred branches, so it doesn't cost them that much to set up a new branch. It costs us a lot of money'. The strategy therefore is to concentrate on products which do not require frequent visits to the bank by customers, such as credit cards and telephone banking, and to target upper-income customers. The bank has a policy of 'locating branches in upper-income residential neighbourhoods,' he said. Because most Korean housing is high-rise, the population tends to be highly concentrated and one branch can serve a far higher number of people that it would do elsewhere. For example, within one kilometre of Citibank's branch south of the River Han in Seoul are some 200,000 households. Citibank does not target expatriate clients. In fact, the branch in Seoul's expatriate district was closed, as expatriates do not tend to keep substantial sums of money in the country. Other foreign banks are not considering entering the retail market. Most of them are preoccupied by the necessity of maintaining their fragile profitability in the corporate sector.</p>

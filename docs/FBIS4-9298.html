			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Olja Obradovic: "Violence With a Government </F> Stamp"]    [Text] Since the Superior Court in Bijelo Polje quashed the  decision of the investigating judge temporarily suspending all  the rights of defense counsel, on 1 March the four of them were  finally able to talk to people of "Muslim faith" suspected of  the grave crimes of threatening the territorial integrity of the  FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] and unauthorized possession  of firearms. The conversation in the Pretrial Custody Prison in  Bijelo Polje, mainly into events that occurred after the arrest,  lasted from 1300 to 1700 hours. Gajo Joksimovic, investigating  judge of the Bijelo Polje Superior Court, and Luka Bulatovic,  warden of the Pretrial Custody Prison, attended the conversation  between the defense lawyers -- Branko Vukotic and Vladan  Djuranovic from Podgorica and Velje Muric and Adil Nasufovic  from Bijelo Polje -- and their 13 clients (four hired other  lawyers and another four are still at large).    All the accused -- Esad Omerovic, Harun Hadzic, Rizah  Burnazovic, Isad Skenderovic, Umer Hadzic, Rifat Veskovic,  Hakija Muratovic, Erdzan Fetahovic, Rasim Sahman, Avdo Ciguljin,  Sefket Brkovic, Sead Gec and Sabahet Spahic -- confirmed that  from the moment they were arrested until they were brought  before the investigating judge they were subjected to almost  unimaginable mental and physical torture. Every one mentioned  the hood and blindfold and spoke of terrible beatings with  "fists, kicks, sticks and all kinds of things on the head, soles  of the feet, and the entire body."  <H5>  Police Creations </H5>   Still, the reason why the conversation confined to events  after the arrest took up four valuable hours of the time of the  defense counsel will best be explained by excerpts from the  testimony of a few of them concerning particular police  inventions.    Harun Hadzic was forced to do 100 jumping jacks and  kneebends. He did not get water; he had to drink from the toilet  to avoid dehydration. He was beaten until the last moment, even  now in the corridor as he was being brought before the  investigating judge. He was not allowed to sleep for three days.  During interrogation he was exposed to a strong floodlight and  high temperature thanks to a device he described as an "asbestos  cap." Exposed to electric shocks, that is, to a device with  which they touched him behind the ear, causing a strong pain and  twitching of the legs. The electric shocks and beating lasted at  least 48 hours. He suspects that he was taken to Foca, since the  people who drove him there threatened to turn him over to  Turtle. He described the building where he was interrogated as a  "labyrinth of many rooms, booths, and bars." It seemed to him  that the room in which he was tortured was lined with red  velvet. They threatened to kill him the whole time.    Esad Omerovic, a mental patient who was discharged from the  army in the care of a guardian, was kicked and beaten and hit  with sticks over his entire body and head. The defense counsel  had the impression that he neither knew where he was nor why.    After his arrest Rizah Burzanovic, hooded and blindfolded,  was driven in an unknown direction "an hour and a half or two  hours from Pljevlja." They beat and kicked him over his entire  body and hit him with sticks. They did not allow him to sleep  for three days. They threatened to kill him. The investigating  judge interrogated him at night.  <H5>  The Middle Ages </H5>   Umer Hadzic is certain that he was in Foca, which he  recognized from the window of the room in which he was tortured.  Along the way his escorts stopped the vehicle to stage an  attempted escape in order to kill him. They fired shots in the  air around him and beat him as he attempted to stay near the  vehicle. They told him to prepare to be shot. When they reached  Foca, he received numerous blows as he ran the gauntlet. The man  they referred to as "Vojvoda" [commander] told them not to beat  him since he was a friend of Lazo Boricic, former head of state  security. Another man, who he thinks from his speech was a  Bosnian, threatened to kill him and avenge his brother whom the  Muslims had "roasted alive." He was "treated" with electric  shocks over his entire body, especially the genitals. He spent  at least two days tied to a radiator in a position that did not  allow him to sit or stand. They threatened they would kill him,  and also said his children would pay if he did not confess. He  says that he would recognize some of the people who tortured him.    They kicked and beat Erdzan Fetahovic and hit him with  sticks. They told him that they had also picked up his wife  ("right now they are lining up for her in the other room").    They asked Avdo Ciguljin whether he could count to 10. When  he said he could, they asked whether he knew how many blows he  had received. When he said he did not know, they retorted that  he should count from the beginning. He counted 100 blows on the  soles of his feet and 50 to his head. They forced a stick into  him, first into his anus and then into his mouth.    Sefket Brkovic's words "If once again I had to go through  all  I have gone through, I would find a way to end my life" are  perhaps the best testimony to the sadism of the torturers  representing such an important state agency that it is entrusted  with care for the security of citizens as well as the  "inviolability of the physical and mental integrity of the  individual," even though he has been detained on suspicion of  the most serious crimes. If perhaps the top leadership of the  Montenegrin government is not privy to the secrets of police  treatment of imprisoned Muslims, as this issue of MONITOR comes  off the press, the defense counsel will be trying to inform it  firsthand.  <H5>  Under the Constitution and Law </H5>   The superior court in Bijelo Polje, and we have to hope for  an honest trial, will decide whether these people took it upon  themselves "to divide Montenegro and the Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia." At the same time the president of all the citizens  of Montenegro must fulfill his promise made in his speech to his  party's congress that "the law-governed, democratic, and civil  state" will treat them "strictly under the constitution and law  and without discrimination." Just that, nothing more.    Nevertheless, even the way in which the investigation has  been conducted does not instill confidence in the specific  institutions of the "law-governed, civil, and democratic state."  A majority of those detained told the defense lawyers that the  attitude towards them during pretrial detention was correct,  given the circumstances, but also that out of fear of new  mistreatment they had repeated the testimony extorted from them  by the police when they were examined by the investigating judge.    The presence of prison personnel when the accused are  interrogated is unthinkable and contrary to the Law on Criminal  Procedure. The decision to suspend all rights of defense  counsel, issued 1 February, was supposedly rescinded no later  than 4 February. However, it was delivered to the defense  counsel only on 21 February, so that for 17 days the defense was  prevented from doing its job. While the defense lawyers were  allowed to examine the papers in the case for the first time  only on 22 February, some of the government media were given  information from police and investigation files much earlier.  Medical examinations were conducted only 12 days after the  suspects were detained, when visible traces of the abuse might  have already disappeared. The defense lawyers were informed  tardily of certain actions in the investigation even after the  suspension was lifted. In view of the presence of the  investigating judge, the visits of the defense lawyers to the  accused were limited by his time. It was not even possible to  photocopy the file, since the machine in the court was broken,  and they were not allowed to take the file out even in the  company of a court employee.    MONITOR nevertheless has learned one piece of good news from  confidential sources: The superior court in Bijelo Polje has  rejected the motion of the superior public prosecutor to turn  certain investigatory operations in these cases over to the  police, although the cases have already been turned over to the  court.</p>

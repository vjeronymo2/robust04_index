			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Corporate manslaughter verdict poses legal dilemma: John Mason reports on the impact of last week's historic conviction of a company Legal history was made last week when a leisure and activity company was convicted of corporate manslaughter over the deaths of four teenagers on a canoe trip in Lyme Bay, Dorset. Both the company, OLL, and its managing director, Mr Peter Kite, were convicted of manslaughter. Mr Kite was jailed for three years. His company was fined Pounds 60,000. The conviction marks the first time a company has been successfully prosecuted for this offence. Previous attempts to prosecute companies in the criminal courts have consistently failed - as the case brought against the P&amp;O shipping line following the Zeebrugge ferry tragedy demonstrated. Lawyers specialising in corporate criminal liability agree that the Lyme Bay verdict will not dramatically reshape the legal landscape, but say it should reinforce warnings to companies of the possible consequences of neglecting safety issues. The case highlights a continuing debate about the adequacy of current law regarding corporate manslaughter. The government has been reluctant to tighten the law, saying it would create extra 'red tape' for companies to contend with. The Law Commission is reviewing the law, however, and is expected to make recommendations early next year. The problems in charging companies with criminal offences such as manslaughter are two-fold. First, recent cases have shown that it is extremely difficult to prove the guilt of all but the smallest companies. Second, there is considerable debate about the purpose of bringing criminal charges against companies at all. Some say that after disasters such as Zeebrugge the public interest may be better served by a speedy, efficient public inquiry aimed at avoiding the repetition of such tragedies. The problems of making a criminal charge 'stick' against a company are well demonstrated by the Zeebrugge prosecution, which fell foul of the strict evidential requirements for proving a case. To prove a company criminally guilty, it must be shown that the 'mind' of the company actively approved the actions or lack of them at the centre of the case. The concept of a company's 'mind' is a legal fiction which has proved troublesome for the courts to cope with. In successive cases it has been taken to mean the conduct at the centre of the case must effectively amount to company policy as approved by directors. In the Zeebrugge case the judge threw out the charges because the failings that led to the tragedy occured too low down the managerial and operational chain of command. The prosecution also failed because of the other widely regarded failing of the current law, which is the inability to consider 'aggregation' - the accumulative effect of a series of failings amounting to gross negligence. The success of the Lyme Bay prosecution illustrates what all lawyers agree is the result of the present state of corporate manslaughter law - that small companies are far more likely to be convicted than large ones. OLL was a small business, in effect run by one man. Lawyers say that, in such circumstances, it is far easier to show that the mind of the individual and the 'mind' of the company are in effect one and the same. This has caused concern among those lawyers acting for victims of disasters. Mr Mark Scoggins, a partner with Davies Arnold Cooper, a law firm specialising in corporate liability, said: 'People feel that the law is ineffective at dealing with the people who are the real cause of safety being ignored. There is a law against this but offences are difficult to prove except where small companies are involved.' The other problem over corporate criminal liability is what purpose such prosecutions serve when there are other ways of protect-ing the public interest. Mr Christopher Newell, director of casework for the Crown Prosecution Service, insists that the CPS will prosecute companies when appropriate. He says, however, that after disasters such as Zeebrugge the public interest is generally best served by trying to ensure that there is no repetition of the tragedy. He says Non-criminal, perhaps public, inquiries and more effective regulation of companies' activities might often be preferable to prosecuting the company concerned. He also insists that criminal prosecutions of companies should not be brought in the emotional aftermath of disasters simply to placate the public. It is too early to judge the prospects of reform. Two years ago Davies Arnold Cooper presented ministers with proposals which would have enabled directors and managers with poor safety records to be banned from the management of any business where they could endanger the lives of others. This, it said, was not anti-business, but pro-safety. Its proposals met with a polite but firm rebuff from ministers. The provisional recommendation of the Law Commission is that companies should be subject to a special regime under which they are judged according to whether they should have been aware that their operations had a significant risk of death or injury. This would avoid the legal pitfalls of the company's 'mind' and aggregation. The commission says effective prosecutions for corporate manslaughter might then be more possible.</p>

			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Value of Scottish exports falls 10% Exports of manufactured goods from Scotland fell 10 per cent in value in the first quarter of this year compared with the previous quarter, according to the recently launched index of Scottish exports compiled by the Scottish Council Development and Industry. The fall, from 127.31 in the fourth quarter of last year to 114.33, is due to a drop in computer, whisky and textile exports after the pre-Christmas surge. Export sales fell from Pounds 3.08bn to Pounds 2.77bn. The index was based at 100 in the first quarter of last year.</p>

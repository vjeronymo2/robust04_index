			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Venture Capital (12): Still doing good business despite the recession - UK Regional Funds IT IS difficult to find any gloom among venture capital providers outside London and southern England. Britain's regional network of funds has been doing good business throughout the recession because it is well suited to what market there is to work in. These are the tiddlers of the industry: funds are small, but so are deals. Regional funds stepped into an equity gap too small for high-overhead London funds to fill. Moreover, most regional deals require the sort of local knowledge and contacts that national or international London-based funds do not have. In the recession, strong trends have emerged in the regions' favour. They show in the figures: excluding 3i, about Pounds 1.42bn was invested at the 1989 national market peak, but this dropped to Pounds 989m last year, a plunge of 30 per cent. Since the number of deals fell by only 8 per cent - from 1,302 to 1,196 - there had to be a fall in the value of investments made by each fund. This amounted to 24 per cent - from Pounds 11.5m in 1989 to Pounds 8.7m last year. Of the Pounds 989m invested last year, 28 per cent was in the Midlands and north, or Pounds 277m. This was up on the 1990 figure (Pounds 256m), itself representing a national share of 23 per cent. However, from the volume point of view, the same regions' share of the 1,196 deals in 1991 was 34 per cent, or 406. The comparative figures for 1990 were 29 per cent and 354. The trend, therefore, is for more deals in the regions where recession has not impacted as badly as in the south, but at lower individual value. The difference this represents on the recession of 1980-82 is that there was no regional venture capital network at all in those days, apart from 3i's branch offices. Indeed, our listing on this page shows more than 60 sources of funds in the regions, most of which have come into being only since the mid-1980s. Most are small, having only Pounds 5m to Pounds 20m each to invest. This in turn means that none is likely to put more than Pounds 1m - 5 per cent of a Pounds 20m fund - into any single deal. However, most of what deals there have been in the last year have nearly all been within range of funds this size. Moreover, the way the bulk are now clustered around the emergent regional financial centres of Manchester, Leeds, Birmingham, Edinburgh and Glasgow means they can easily syndicate quite large deals among themselves. None of these centres needs to go anywhere else to raise Pounds 20m now, while even five or six years ago they would have had to have help from London. As the London-based Mr Charles Sherwood of Schroder Ventures, puts it: 'If you have a small deal in, say, Leeds and don't need anything more than generalised venture capital skills, why even think of taking it outside Yorkshire? 'We don't have the ability to respond quickly to deals outside London and we don't have enough regular contact with intermediaries in regional centres to develop trust between them and our funds,' he adds. Figures from 3i reinforce the general picture. North-west investments by 3i were Pounds 44m in 1991-92, compared with Pounds 12m the previous year. The respective figures for Yorkshire and Humberside were Pounds 29m and Pounds 18m, and for the north-east, Pounds 18m and Pounds 13m. Mr Charles Richardson, 3i's director for the north and Scotland, says there are three reasons for the growth. Prices are more realistic and lower, large companies have become keener to dispose of non-core activities as the recession has deepened, and there has been an increase in management buyouts and buy ins from parent companies in receivership. 3i says there has also been a shift in attitudes favouring equity capital, especially with the banks reluctant to lend and many companies wanting to avoid the mistakes of the 1980s by becoming overgeared and incapable of responding to upturn. One of its bigger regional deals was the Pounds 27m buyout of Standard Fireworks of West Yorkshire from Scottish Heritable Trust. Less spectacular, but no less important, was the purchase by its management of Samuel Banner, a Liverpool solvents and chemicals blender. Other deals included the Pounds 15m buyout of Mark Birkbeck Holdings, a Lancashire retailer and wholesaler of natural fibre leisurewear, and the buyout of the Cheshire-based Taco Holdings, one of the UK's largest independent manufacturers of polythene film. Mr Jonathan Diggines heads Murray Johnstone's Manchester office, which also manages Ventures North West, the investment capital fund of the Greater Manchester Pensions Authority - 'our experience shows good deals can be done, even in deep recession,' he says. He was involved in the 3i-led support of the management buyout of housebuilder George Langdon from Whitecroft, the Wilmslow conglomerate, which has been restructuring to get through the recession. The housebuilder is doing well because northern prices never bubbled and have not declined significantly - in sharp contrast to the south. Murray Johnstone's biggest deal this year was the purchase of the Salford-based Canadian Pizza from its north American parent. It underwrote more than Pounds 9m of funding and has happily hung on to Pounds 7.5m of investment after letting other funds in on the deal. Ventures North West even achieved its first successful exit, following the return to successful health of Alexander Drew, a textile finisher bought out from the failing Coloroll group in 1989 in a deal that also involved Morgan Grenfell, Charterhouse and Deutsche Bank. Mr Edmund Johnston runs one of Britain's smallest regional funds, Ulster Development Capital in Belfast, which is backed mainly by two Dublin pension funds and four British insurance companies. It has been revolving its returns since starting in 1985 and has done 20 deals from a base fund of only Pounds 1m. 'Admittedly it's from a low base, but we are finding more activity and optimism. There's not much new stuff: likely deals are usually linked to some sort of reconstruction, such as buyouts or buy ins, or some sort of change of ownership of a business for one reason or another,' says Mr Johnston. NATIONAL Pressures are even encouraging reconstruction of the venture capital industry itself. The most significant example so far came at the end of May, when Schroder backed the purchase of Sumit Equity Ventures, one of the oldest regional groups of funds, from AE Sharp, the Birmingham-based stockbroking and financial services company. Sumit has three funds worth Pounds 43m, including a publicly quoted investment trust of Pounds 10m. It will now be run by Mr Lyndsay Bury, previously a founder of Apricot Computers and a founder director of Allied Dunbar Bank. AE Sharp retains 10 per cent, but Mr Bury's other shareholders will be Schroder Ventures and Mr Peter Folkman's Pounds 20m North of England fund, which Schroder also backs. Sherwood says the industry is now mature and is segmenting. The strength of London funds is in big, complex, international or specialised, high technology deals. He sees Schroder's tie-up with Mr Folkman - a former 3i director - and Mr Bury as akin to a franchising operation, with London money made more easily available for medium-sized or bigger deals in the regions. This sort of thing should enable regional funds to trade their local knowledge and contacts for access to London money, some hundreds of millions of pounds of which are uninvested at present. The tiddlers of the industry may well have more national bargaining power than they realise.</p>

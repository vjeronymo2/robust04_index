			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Top-of-range private medical plan launched NORWICH Union Healthcare yesterday launched a top-of-the-range private medical insurance scheme which will eliminate the need for most clients to use the National Health Service. The Premier Care policy will be marketed by Norwich Union for 'people who do not want to rely on the NHS.' Treatment for a number of conditions and procedures which are excluded from many private medical insurance schemes - among them infertility, long-term renal dialysis and pregnancy - will be covered. It will also pay for consultations with private GPs and include private dental treatment and eye tests. The Premier Care policy will be aimed at individuals willing to pay a higher-than-average premium to side-step the NHS in most eventualities. The cost of the new policy will depend on age and medical history, with a healthy 35-year-old paying about Pounds 1,000 a year. Most pre-existing conditions will be taken on for a higher premium.</p>

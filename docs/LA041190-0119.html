			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TWO MITSUBISHI UNITS PLAN A CONTROVERSIAL MERGER  </P> <P> Two members of the Mitsubishi Group created from the breakup of Mitsubishi  Mining during the U.S. occupation after World War II announced Tuesday that  they will merge.  </P> <P> Mitsubishi Metal Corp. and Mitsubishi Mining &amp; Cement Co., in announcing  their merger, attempted to head off expected criticism that the move is a step  toward re-establishment of the monopoly power held by Japan's prewar zaibatsu  financial combines.  </P> <P> The Mitsubishi Group companies comprised one of the three most powerful  zaibatsu before and during World War II.  </P> <P> Under the merger plan, nine shares of Mitsubishi Metal will equal 10 shares of  Mitsubishi Mining &amp; Cement effective Dec. 1, the companies said.  </P> <P> The merger will link one of Japan's largest smelters of nonferrous metals with  one of its largest producers of cement.  </P> <P> "Every president of the two companies over the past 40 years sought out the  possibility of a merger," said Mitsubishi Metal President Takeshi Nagano, who  will become chairman of the new company.  </P> <P> "When this merger is complete, we will feel that the war is finally over for  our companies," Nagano said at a news conference jointly sponsored by the two  firms.  </P> <P> The presidents of the two companies said the merger should not be seen as a  "monopolistic threat."  </P> <P> By combining resources, the two firms will be able to grow into a comprehensive  company, which is "the best way to conduct a flexible and dynamic adjustment to  various structural changes progressing worldwide," Nagano said.  </P> <P> Masaya Fujimaru, president of Mitsubishi Mining &amp; Cement, who will be  president of the new company, said the merger is not aimed at strengthening the  business affiliations of the Mitsubishi Group, which is still known for its  strong ties among member companies.  </P> <P> Nagano said the metal business is vulnerable to changes in foreign exchange  rates and market prices, and the merger would help protect against such  vulnerability.  </P> <P> In addition, the companies said the combination of research in metals and  ceramics is expected to create a wide range of new materials.  </P> <P> The sales of the new company are expected to total the equivalent of about $5.7  billion during the first year and $6.4 billion within the first five years, the  two companies said. The new company, which will have 9,000 employees, will have  total assets of $5.1 billion, they said.  </P></p>

			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / How To Spend It: Rembrandt: images for the masses IF YOU have seen either of the Rembrandt exhibitions currently showing in London - whether the paintings and etchings at the new Sainsbury Wing of The National Gallery, or the drawings at the British Museum - you are likely to have come away with images that you will remember for ever. Few of us are in the genuine Rembrandt-owning league, but there are now fine techniques for reproducing some of the images and The Quintessa Art Collection has produced some exceptionally fine facsimiles of a few of the Rembrandt drawings on show. The prints come beautifully mounted in cream and sepia. All come with relevant curatorial information and the imprimature of British Museum approval attached to the back, and prices are exceedingly reasonable. Two women teaching a child to walk - an exceptionally tender drawing and one of my favourites, photographed above - measures 10 ins by 9 ins and costs Pounds 33, mounted but unframed, Pounds 59 framed. Other favourites are the Study of a Lioness (15 ins by 11 ins, Pounds 40 mounted, Pounds 82 framed), and Study of a Girl Sleeping (13 ins by 15 ins (Pounds 47 mounted, Pounds 94 framed). From the British Museum gift shop, The Victoria &amp; Albert Museum gift shop, The General Trading Company and Fortnum &amp; Mason's Stationery Department.</p>

Xiao Rong said: The description of my father's conditions  today can be boiled down to two sentences. The first is that he  is not ill, and the second is that he is, after all, 90 years  old. It is the law of nature; his physical quality, in its  entirety, is poorer than it was a couple of years ago.  Nevertheless, he persists in doing some exercises every day,  mainly walking. He makes it a rule to walk three kilometers  each day, even against Beijing's cold wind.    Xiao Rong said: I personally believe that a secret of my  father's longevity is precisely an orderly life. Even before  his retirement, when he was still in office, he led a very  orderly life. Since his retirement, he has continued to maintain  a very orderly life. Every day, he gets up at around 0700, then  he does some exercises, in a workout with several movements,  which he himself has worked out. After breakfast, he reads the  press. My father just loves to read newspapers. I believe, in  his mind, reading the press is no less important than reading  documents. He subscribes to a dozen or so newspapers, which he  invariably reads through -- the whole lot. We used to say as a  joke that the source of information in our family is precisely  my father because, none of us in our family reads the press as  earnestly as he does, none of us reads such a huge volume as he  does. Sometimes, he will ask us which team won a famous  football match a day before, and none of us can say. Then he  will be very pleased with himself, telling us the result. After  reading the press, it is time for a walk in the morning. In the  remainder of the day, he sometimes does some reading, or watches  television. Then, there are his grandchildren. When they are  back from school at noon, they invariably will go to see their  grandpa and play with him. My father is a person who just loves  the family, his children and grandchildren. Therefore, being  together with his family members is his happiest time every day.  He spends most of his time in the evening playing bridge. He  has a few loyal partners playing bridge, most of whom are  retired old men.</p>

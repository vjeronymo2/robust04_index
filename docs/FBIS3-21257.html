Minute  characters or designs are drawn by the atoms.    Various techniques have been researched, but the one being  used by this project is the STM (scanning tunneling microscope)  method. When a 5-volt 30-millisecond pulse voltage is applied to  the STM probe, atoms adhere to the tip of the probe. The pulse  voltage is also applied when the atom adhering to the tip is  released. However, even under the same conditions, atoms cannot  always be successfully manipulated by applying a voltage pulse.  Therefore, up until now, after pulse voltage was applied, it was  necessary to confirm whether the atom was adhering to the probe  tip or had been released by using the original function of the  STM as a microscopic device.    This project research group developed a method to detect a  feeble signal change which occurs when the atom adheres to the  probe or when the atom is released from the probe. This made it  possible to analyze the circumstances of the atomic manipulation  in real time and detect, with certainty, whether the atom was  adhering to the probe or had been released.    They succeeded in moving atoms on the silicon surface at  will  by using this real time atomic analysis technology. In addition,  they were able to construct atomcraft made with hydrogen atoms  on the silicon surface.    In future research, they plan to take up the challenge of  real time analysis of atoms other than silicon or hydrogen.</p>

			<p><P> January 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A friend of a Marine who died when he was left behind in the Mojave Desert  after a training exercise testified in Camp Lejeune, N.C., that he had asked  about his friend's absence a day before he was reported missing. There was  "total confusion" when Lance Cpl. Jason Rother was discovered missing, Lance  Cpl. Kevin Robertson said at the court-martial of Rother's platoon sergeant.  Sgt. Christopher Clyde is charged with dereliction of duty and disobeying an  order. Rother, 19, of Minneapolis, died after he was left at his post as a road  guide at the end of a training exercise Aug. 30. He was not reported missing  until nearly two days later and his remains were not found until Dec. 4.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, head of the </F> Palestinian delegation to the bilateral talks with Israel, by an  unidentified reporter, place and date not given -- recorded]    [Text] ['Urayqat] Anger prevails in the occupied territory  and people here have called on the international community to  move swiftly to provide international protection for the  defenseless Palestinian people. All forces and figures in  Jericho participated in a demonstration this morning in which  they called for international protection and the disarming of  the settlers. After the demonstration ended safely, the Army  interfered and fired at people killing a 17-year old youth.  When the Army started shooting I headed for the market downtown  where, in my direction, they fired tear gas and a stun grenade  which hit me in my left leg. Praise be to God, there are some  bruises, but the injury is not serious.    However, what is more important than all this is that since  the terrorist act carried out by the Israeli settler in the holy  Ibrahimi Mosque, the Israeli Army has killed 21 Palestinian  youths. The Israeli Army is indiscriminately firing at our  people. As Israel hides its crimes by standing behind settlers  or its terrorist cliques, the regular Israeli Army is killing  people and carrying out terrorist acts. This situation  strengthens the Palestinian demand for international protection  in accordance with the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949.    [Reporter] Brother Sa'ib 'Urayqat: Israeli Prime Minister  Yitzhaq Rabin urged the PLO to resume the talks and the Israeli  Army is continuing brutal and repressive acts on the ground.  How can we reconcile these two extremist Israeli stands?    ['Urayqat] It is impossible to reconcile these two stands.  Rabin must make a choice between settlements and peace, because  the two cannot coexist. This message was conveyed to Rabin last  Friday through his delegation in Washington. The PLO told him  that he has to move toward four things: First, disarming the  settlers; second, providing international protection for the  Palestinian people; third, dismantling settlements in Gaza and  Hebron; and fourth, placing the settlements issue at the top of  the talks agenda. We believe that if the issue of settlements  is not at the top of the talks agenda these talks will be  useless. Regrettably, Rabin's responses, which came during the  cabinet meeting, were weak and meaningless formalities. We want  Rabin to make the appropriate decisions. The talks in  themselves are not the objective.    On the other hand, the U.S. Administration has tried to  limit  the danger by adopting procedural measures such as moving the  venue of the talks. It ignored the substantial issues; namely,  the settlements and international protection for the Palestinian  people. This thing places the peace process in a deadlock. We,  the Palestinian people, seek a just, genuine, and comprehensive  peace on all Palestinian and Arab fronts. We want peace in  accordance with the international charters and UN resolutions,  particularly Resolutions 242 and 338. Rabin, however, cannot  hold talks just for the sake of holding talks.    [Reporter] Brother Sa'ib 'Urayqat, the PLO yesterday  suspended negotiations with Israel pending the meeting of its  conditions regarding the occupied territories: Providing  protection for the Palestinian residents and disarming settlers.  In your opinion, can these negotiations resume without these  PLO conditions being met?    ['Urayqat] As I said, the negotiations cannot be an end in  and of themselves. The PLO sent a host of questions to the  Israeli Government, headed by the demands that I have mentioned  to you. We are waiting for the Israeli Government's response.  The negotiations are suspended now. The PLO is holding  extensive international and Arab contacts, covering the United  States, Russia, Europe, and Arab states. Under these particular  circumstances, we hope that we will be able to revive Arab  coordination. This is because it was a great decision by other  Arab delegations toward entrenching the concept of a  comprehensive solution when they suspended the negotiations in  Washington in the wake of the massacre. I believe that it is  high time that the Arab nation moves toward devising a  comprehensive strategy. Likewise, negotiations on other tracks  cannot continue for the sake of negotiations only.    [Reporter] Brother Sa'ib 'Urayqat, some experts say that a  unified Arab stand demanding that Israel implement UN  resolutions practically annuls the possibility of negotiating  the Oslo-Jericho [as heard] agreement, which specifies an  interim period for the occupied territories before arriving at  the final status. Can the Oslo agreement be abandoned?    ['Urayqat] In fact, the question is not one of abandoning  any  agreements. Everyone realizes that the Palestinian track in the  peace process has certain peculiarities. We are not talking  about an occupied part of the Palestinian territory. We are  talking about occupied Palestine as a whole, about all aspects  of life in Palestine under the control of the occupation.  Therefore, the question does not concern the method of the  Israeli implementation and withdrawal, be it phased or not  phased; the question has to do with listing a basic item on the  Palestinian-Israeli agenda, which is the issue of settlements.  In the past, Israel insisted that this issue be postponed until  the final status is discussed. During the negotiations, when  they were asked how they will provide protection or prevent the  settlers from carrying out terrorist operations against the  Palestinian people, they said: This is our responsibility.  Last Friday, this Israeli responsibility was put to the test  and failed. Israel proved that it cannot do that. Therefore,  the question of placing settlements on the agenda is essential.  In addition, there is the issue of international protection.  If Israel withdraws and redeploys its forces, then why should  it mind an effective international presence in the Palestinian  territory to provide protection for 2 million defenseless  Palestinians?    [Reporter] In other words, you are demanding international  protection for the Palestinians in the occupied territories, the  disarming of the settlers, and the raising of the issue of  settlements at the table of negotiations. Otherwise, you will  not go to the negotiations with Israel?    ['Urayqat] The decision will be made by the leadership.  However, I personally believe that any negotiations that do not  place the issue of settlements at the top of the agenda will be  useless.    [Reporter] Sa'ib 'Urayqat, are you personally optimistic  about the resolution that the UN Security Council may issue?    ['Urayqat] In fact, I realize that the U.S. Administration  is  being hesitant. I realize that from the outset, the U.S.  Administration intervened and focused on procedural issues  rather than on substance. This is not promising. The U.S. bias  toward Israel is very clear. I am not very optimistic about the  U.S. position, specifically at the UN Security Council.    [Reporter] Thank you, brother Sa'ib 'Urayqat for this  interview with radio Monte Carlo.    ['Urayqat] Thank you.</p>

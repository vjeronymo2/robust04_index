			<p><P> January 1, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROMANIAN REBUILDING  </P> <P> The deaths of thousands of people in Timisoara and Bucharest were not in vain.  The extent of the tyranny that ruled Romania is beyond belief.  </P> <P> For such a monstrosity to be overcome so fast is in itself a miracle.  </P> <P> The battle is hardly over; although the cancerous core of the leadership is  gone, the weight of the past must be now reshaped into a future. This could be  the first time in recent history that America and the Soviet Union cooperate in  the rebuilding of a shattered state and economy.  </P> <P> Romania needs all the help we can offer: Advisers from a mutual pool of  human/technological resources provided through the United Nations and other  international bodies. An unprecedented opportunity is now presenting itself; a  global shift towards increased cooperation between the East and West on many  levels previously thought impossible.  </P> <P> The bloody failure of the police state run by Ceausescu could have become a  drawn-out civil war. Instead, it seems to be headed in a positive direction.  </P> <P> We can help Romania and Eastern Europe rebuild their economies, and work  together towards a positive future. There are astounding implications for world  peace and commerce, two faces of the same dream.  </P> <P> MIHAI MANOLIU  </P> <P> Torrance  </P> <P> Mihai Manoliu is a Romanian refugee and American writer.  </P> <P> </P></p>

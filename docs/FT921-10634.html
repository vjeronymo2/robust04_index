			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets: Continentals join real estate casualty list - But property shares have registered varied rates of decline Property shares subsided across the globe in the final quarter of 1991. According to the FT-Actuaries World Indices, the sector fell 4.3 per cent in local currency terms, while the World Index itself was flat; but for some positive national performances, particularly in Singapore, Australia and the US, the October/December result would have been worse. The rate of decline varied. In Canada, property shares fell by an average of 5 per cent; in Italy by 15 per cent; in Spain by 30 per cent; in France by 2 per cent; in Sweden by 22 per cent; in the UK by 18 per cent; in Japan by 5 per cent; and in New Zealand by 20 per cent, according to the stockbrokers County NatWest. The Continental European markets are the most recent casualties. 'Even those markets which had remained relatively unaffected are now facing a significant downturn in activity with rental and capital growth rates rapidly falling towards nil,' says Mr Ray Jones of Paribas Capital Markets. Most European property shares are now trading at the bottom of their normal range, when considered in terms of their discount to net assets. The downturn in the economy has paralysed tenants and investors, who are unwilling to commit themselves in such an uncertain climate. That said, these property markets may escape the worst of the downturn because they are less affected by over-lending and overbuilding than the English-speaking economies. Few risk as steep a fall in property shares as the UK, where the sector has dropped by 41 per cent over the last three years. After the UK, France has proved the most vulnerable direct property market in Europe, thanks to a high level of speculative bank loans to developers. Paris has seen a wave of new developments and decreased activity which has pushed rents down by some 10 per cent and capital values down by 20 to 25 per cent over the last year. However, French property shares have been relatively stable as they have offered large discounts to net assets and high yields after falling by 25 per cent in 1990. In Germany, the real estate market slowed sharply in the last quarter of 1991, thanks to static or falling rental levels and higher interest rates. However, vacancy rates are just 1-3 per cent, which should prevent any significant fall in rents. The fundamental changes affecting Germany - re-unification, changes in eastern Europe and expectations of a post-1992 Europe - have sustained interest in the few quoted property companies (too few, indeed, to have a place in the FT-Actuaries World Indices). Concordia, a thinly-traded stock with few sellers and a high degree of foreign interest, ended the year on a 20 per cent premium to net assets. Spanish property fell in value in the latter part of last year as a result of an increased supply of offices in Madrid and a withdrawal of foreign investors. With relatively high interest rates, a slowing economy and disappointment over the absence of lease law reform, the performance of shares like Metrovacesa has been very weak. The Dutch property market has performed dully, with low levels of investment activity. But its large property companies are not representative of the market as they have an international spread of investments. The performance of Rodamco, which is by far the largest Dutch property investment vehicle, has also been affected by some momentous corporate decisions. Its share price fell heavily in late 1990 when it changed, in effect, from an open-ended to a close-ended company. In December, ABP, the Dutch civil servants pension fund, said it would invest Pounds 770m in Rodamco at net asset value. Late last month Wereldhave and VIB, the Netherlands' second and third largest property investment companies, announced plans to look into the possibility of entering into a 'far-reaching form of co-operation'. Looking beyond the current trough, a case can be argued for investing in continental property companies. Mr David Harris of Carnegie International, the UK-based broker, believes that the Maastricht summit has huge implications. He thinks that monetary union will foster the economic conditions conducive for growth in property values. Moreover, investment may be stimulated by unhindered capital flows across EC boundaries. But recovery is likely to be a slow process. Mr Jones of Paribas is generally cautious about property equities on fundamental grounds. In his view, the continental property markets are likely to remain quiet in the first half of 1992, before stabilising towards the end of the year.</p>

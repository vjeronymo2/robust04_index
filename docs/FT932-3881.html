			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / International Company News: Dividend maintained at James Hardie Industries JAMES Hardie Industries, the Australian building products group, is holding its dividend at 12 cents a share for the year ended March following a sharp rise in profits, caused mainly by a turnround in abnormal items. Profits increased to ADollars 56.5m (USDollars 38m) from ADollars 5.9m, on revenues which rose to ADollars 1.59bn from ADollars 1.55bn. Before abnormals, earnings fell slightly to ADollars 70.3m from ADollars 72.8m. The result included an abnormal loss of ADollars 10.4m, well down on the previous year's loss of ADollars 73.4m. The improvement reflected a write-back of value in the US fibre operations, which had been written down in the previous year. Net earnings were also helped by a fall in the tax bill to ADollars 6.2m from ADollars 16.5m, mainly through retrospective research and development claims. Interest expense eased to ADollars 41 from ADollars 49.8m and depreciation rose to ADollars 52.2m from ADollars 50.3m. Mr Keith Barton, managing director, said he expected earnings before interest and tax to rise in the current year,but the improvement would come from internal efficiencies rather than market growth.</p>

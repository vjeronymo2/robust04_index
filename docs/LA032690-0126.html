			<p><P> March 26, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANGEL ROSTER JUST THE SPOT FOR HILL  </P> <P> He can hit from either side of the plate, throw with either hand and play  second base, shortstop or third. With all of the things that Donnie Hill can do  for the Angels, it's easy to overlook the two he won't do.  </P> <P> One of them is play first base.  </P> <P> "I'm a little short for that," said Hill, who is generously listed at 5-foot-11  on the Angels' roster. "Maybe when I grow up."  </P> <P> The other thing he isn't likely to do is discuss the eye ailment that  threatened his career. An infection that he developed in 1987, apparently  caused by his contact lenses, didn't disappear until Hill was fitted with  disposable lenses, which are discarded before bacteria can build on them.  </P> <P> Free of discomfort and distorted vision, Hill has shown enough eagerness and  versatility in spring training to virtually assure himself of a spot on the  Angels' roster.  </P> <P> "The kid can play three infield positions and switch-hit; there's not too many  of those around," Angel Manager Doug Rader said of Hill, who was signed as a  free agent in January and came to camp as a non-roster player. "If he remains  healthy, he remains in our plans. The only thing that could get in the way is  his eye problem."  </P> <P> Eye problem? What eye problem?  </P> <P> "I have no eye problem," said Hill, who was born in Pomona, graduated from  Edison High School in Huntington Beach and later played at Orange Coast  College. "It's completely gone now. It affected my vision, but it's cleared up  and my eyes are fine."  </P> <P> Hill, 29, signed with the Oakland Athletics in 1981 and worked through their  farm system as a shortstop. He was supposed to start the 1985 season in double  A, but he was moved to second when Tony Phillips was injured during spring  training.  </P> <P> Hill batted .285 that season, with three home runs and 48 runs batted in, and  hit .283 the following season as the regular second baseman.  </P> <P> Hill was traded to the Chicago White Sox in December, 1986 and opened the 1987  season at second base, but his eye ailment put him on the disabled list early  in the season and a hamstring injury put him back on the disabled list in July  and August. He platooned at second for most of 1988, when his average fell to a  career-low .217.  </P> <P> He was released by the White Sox last March, but the A's signed him to a  triple-A contract with their Tacoma affiliate. He batted .261 in 58 games, but  was released by Oakland in August.  </P> <P> Hill, familiar to Rader from Rader's stint as a coach and interim manager in  Chicago, is determined not to waste this unexpected chance with the Angels.  </P> <P> "I came to camp ready to do everything I could to make the club," said Hill,  who played second, short and third in Sunday's intrasquad game. "I was kind of  worried during the lockout, but things have worked out OK so far. I look at  this as getting another chance to prove I can play."  </P> <P> Hill would fit into Rader's ideal of stockpiling versatile players if he can  give second baseman Johnny Ray, shortstop Dick Schofield or third baseman Jack  Howell an occasional rest without the Angels losing anything in the field.  </P> <P> Rader has said that he will try second baseman Mark McLemore at third and  short. Kent Anderson played at second and third last season, in addition to the  65 games that he started at short. Bobby Rose can also play second or third.  </P> <P> Becoming so versatile wasn't Hill's original plan.  </P> <P> "Oakland moved me to second in '85, but I really didn't think much about  playing other positions until then," he said. "As time has gone on, especially  if you're not starting, it helps to be able to play other positions.  </P> <P> "I started at third in Chicago a little bit, so basically, I have quite a bit  of time in at all three. Normally, I'd say I prefer second base, but I'm  comfortable at all the rest. Wherever he (Rader) sticks me, I'll just try to do  the best I can."  </P> <P> At first, Hill was uncomfortable moving around the infield because "I didn't  know how the ball comes to you off certain hitters."  </P> <P> "Now, I'm beyond that," he said. "It was an adjustment going from being a  starter to being a utility player, too, but when Tony La Russa came over to  (manage) Oakland, he went big with the 'Everybody plays' type of thing.  </P> <P> "Everybody had days off and we had a lot of guys coming in and out, especially  as the game kprogressed. It wasn't hard for me. It's worked for the A's,  especially the last couple years. It makes it easier on everybody when you have  guys who can play different positions.  </P> <P> "Look at Tony Phillips. You could stick him anywhere, well, maybe anywhere but  catcher."  </P> <P> Hill says he might even try to pitch.  </P> <P> "Yeah, I've got to talk to Doug about that left-handed changeup I've been  working on," joked Hill, who throws right-handed.  </P> <P> The position he most wants, though, is a spot on the 40-man roster.  </P> <P> "Anywhere they want to put me, I'll play my hardest," Hill said. "I know it's  not over yet and I just have to keep doing whatever I can."  </P></p>

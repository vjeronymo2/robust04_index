			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "We Are Partners"] </F>   [Text] When he arrived in our country Alexander Watson, the  U.S. assistant secretary for inter-American affairs, said: "We  have to work together, as partners, to meet the challenges  confronting us, such as the scourge of drug trafficking."    This is precisely how it should be. Heroin consumption, for  example, is on the increase in the United States. This in turn  triggers the spread of poppy fields in Peru--in Cajamarca,  Amazonas, part of San Martin, and Madre de Dios--thus creating  problems that our country did not have before.    Despite this, rules should be set on how and where this  joint  collaboration is to be undertaken. With regard to coca, two  special reports published by EXPRESO this week clearly state  that the interdiction policy furthered by the Peruvian Armed  Forces in the Huallaga region has been quite successful, so much  so that it has caused the price of a kilogram of cocaine paste  to plummet from $1,500 in 1993 to its current value of $200.    The cultivation of traditional crops like rice, corn, and  cotton has been partially resumed thanks to the reopening of  highways. This has nonetheless been a very difficult decision,  as it entailed the impoverishment of farmers.    It goes without saying that the decline in the coca business  in the Huallaga region does not necessarily mean that it has  been reduced in the whole of Peru. It has shifted toward other  areas, with resulting effects in terms of environmental  devastation and corruption. The government has, however,  already launched a thrust against drug kingpins. The capture of  "El Vaticano" has been a great step forward.    What merits highlighting for the purpose of our discussion  is  that both the mass exodus of drug traffickers from the Huallaga  region--the leading coca production center in Peru--and the  arrest of "El Vaticano" took place precisely during the year in  which the United States withdrew nearly all its aid for the  fight against drug trafficking. The effort has, therefore, been  made by Peru--only by Peru. This all goes to prove that, at  least on a short term basis, one obtains better results without  U.S. aid than with it.    Does this mean that all joint endeavors should be left  aside?  Not necessarily. It means that this concerted effort ought to  revolve around crop substitution rather than interdiction or  police-related considerations. Peru has managed, of late, to  develop a relatively advanced, shrewd, and intelligent  technology that is also respectful of human rights. In this  area, we would rather work on our own. We do, however, need  financial resources for crop substitution programs, especially  as we are channeling all our resources into drug enforcement  operations.    These kinds of subjects are, incidentally, what the two  partners should today be discussing.</p>

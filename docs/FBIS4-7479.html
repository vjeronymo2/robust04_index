			<p>BFN     [Text] Concluding the visit to our country by Russian  Defense Minister General Pavel Grachev, a visit that included  meetings with President Iliescu, the Romanian prime minister,  and the Romanian minister of foreign affairs, the Russian guest  held a news conference on 30 March.    The news conference focused on the major results of the  visit  and revealed the wish of both countries to put an end to the  period of stagnation in bilateral relations. Likewise, the  sides approached the issue of the future meeting between Ion  Iliescu and Boris Yeltsin and Vacaroiu and Chenomyrdin.    General Grachev invited his Romanian counterpart to visit  Moscow.    The military cooperation agreement between the two countries  was viewed by both sides as a beginning of a period of fruitful  cooperation.    During the news conference Romanian Defense Minister  Gheorghe  Tinca mentioned that neighborliness should not be understood as  a strictly geographical term, as it is also a political concept.    He also said that we consider Greece and Turkey to be our  neighbors because good-neighborliness is a much deeper concept  that reflects a system of relations based on certain principles  that cannot have substance and vitality if they are not regarded  in a broader context.</p>

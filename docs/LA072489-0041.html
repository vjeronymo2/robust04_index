			<p><P> July 24, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> ALZHEIMER'S DRUG QUESTIONED  </P> <P> An experimental drug for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease must undergo  further study before its usefulness can be determined, a researcher testing the  drug said last week. Interim data from a study of the drug THA on 100 patients  found that there are "substantial" health risks associated with the drug and  that review of the study did not find statistical evidence of the drug's  benefit, Mt. Sinai Medical Center researcher Kenneth Davis said.  </P> <P> THA has received wide attention because there is no proven treatment for  Alzheimer's disease, a degenerative brain disorder affecting more than 2  million Americans. Two years ago, Warner-Lambert Co. began a study of the drug  after Arcadia psychiatrist William Summers reported improved memory and  functioning in his Alzheimer's patients taking the drug.  </P> <P> However, Davis said that as many as 30% of patients in the Warner-Lambert study  showed an increase in liver enzymes suggesting liver toxicity and that 15% had  to be taken off the drug for this reason. Davis said THA's liver toxicity would  be acceptable if the drug showed a measurable benefit to patients, but that  more patients must be studied before such a determination can be made.  </P></p>

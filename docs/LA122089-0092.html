			<p><P> December 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STOCK PROSPECTUS LIFTS VEIL OF SECRECY AT READER'S DIGEST  </P> <P> Reader's Digest Assn., publisher of the world's most widely read magazine, on  Tuesday issued the prospectus for its first stock offering and in so doing  lifted a veil of secrecy that has hidden its inner financial workings for six  decades.  </P> <P> The prospectus for the sale of 25 million non-voting shares showed a publishing  and direct-mail business that has undergone booming growth in recent years but  that also saw profit growth abruptly slow in the fiscal year that ended last  June.  </P> <P> With annual revenue of about $1.83 billion, the association is controlled by a  charitable trust and two funds set up by founders DeWitt Wallace, who died in  1981, and Lila Wallace, who died in 1984. In 1922, the pair launched a magazine  that grew to a current worldwide circulation of 28 million, mixing conservative  politics and plain-spun humor.  </P> <P> The underwriters of the offering, Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. and Lazard Freres  &amp; Co., expect that the non-voting Class A shares will be priced between $18  and $22 apiece. At that valuation, the offering would be worth $450 million to  $550 million.  </P> <P> And assuming that the company's 20 million Class B voting shares are worth no  less than the 124 million non-voting shares, the entire company would have a  value of as much as $3.2 billion.  </P> <P> The non-voting shares, which represent 21% of all common stock, will be sold by  the two controlling funds and seven independent foundations set up earlier in  the decade to support some of the Wallaces' favorite charities. Those  foundations benefit, among others, Colonial Williamsburg, the Metropolitan  Museum of Art in New York, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York,  and a conservation and preservation group called Scenic Hudson.  </P> <P> The two controlling funds -- the DeWitt Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund and the  Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund -- each own 10 million voting common shares,  or 50% of the class.  </P> <P> The firm said it was the foundations' wish to sell some shares to create a more  active market for the securities, making it easier for shareholders to sell  stock if they wish. Of the 25 million Class A shares to be sold, 21 million  will be sold in the United States and the balance will be sold abroad.  </P> <P> The prospectus for the securities, which will be sold in February, shows how  the company has moved from a sole focus on its Reader's Digest and Reader's  Digest Condensed Books lines to direct marketing of other books, specialty  magazines, recorded music, videotapes and other merchandise. Among the  specialty magazines are the Family Handyman, Travel Holiday and New Choices for  the Best Years.  </P> <P> The books and entertainment products now account for more than half of the  business's total revenue and operating profits.  </P> <P> After the death of Lila Wallace in 1984, the company's management embarked on a  new strategy from its headquarters in suburban Westchester County, N.Y. It  expanded operations while cutting costs, closing less profitable businesses and  reducing its work force to a current 7,400 from 9,200.  </P> <P> Between 1985 and 1988, net income grew an average of 40% a year, and pretax  operating income increased by an average of 56% annually.  </P> <P> Between fiscal 1988 and fiscal 1989, however, operating profit fell 3% to $207  million and net income rose only 7% to $152 million. The company attributed the  slowdown to a number of factors, including slower book sales, the addition of  new money-losing magazines, and the increased costs from new compensation and  profit-sharing plans.  </P> <P> READER'S DIGEST ASSN. AT A GLANCE  </P> <P> Based in Pleasantville, N.Y., the association is a major publisher and  direct-mail marketer. Its flagship monthly, the Reader's Digest, is published  in 39 editions in 15 languages, with a worldwide circulation of 28 million. In  fiscal 1989, the magazine posted operating income of $62 million on revenue of  $589 million, about 32% of the company's total. Direct-mail sales of books,  recorded music and home video products generated $192 million in operating  income on $1.09 billion in revenue, about 59% of the company's total. The  association also publishes special interest magazines and assists school  fund-raising campaigns.  </P> <P> Year ended June 30  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.22IN:1.78IN:1.78IN:1.78IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="4"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1989  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1988  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1987  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Sales  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> (millions)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $1,832  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $1,712  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $1,420  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Net income  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> (millions)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 152  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 142  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 95  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> Assets: $1.17 billion  </P> <P> Employees: 7,400  </P></p>

			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / Newspaper industry plans second campaign against possible VAT on papers THE newspaper industry is planning its second campaign in eight years against the possible imposition of value added tax on newspapers, Raymond Snoddy writes. The industry is increasingly worried that the government will impose VAT on newspapers and magazines - and possibly books - in one of next year's two Budgets. Mr Dugal Nisbet-Smith, director of the Newspaper Society, which represents local and regional newspapers, said yesterday: 'We have not had a denial from any minister that this is on the agenda.' The Newspaper Society has commissioned consultants Price Waterhouse to look at the impact the imposition of 17.5 per cent VAT on newspapers would have. During the 1984-85 campaign against VAT, Price Waterhouse said a 15 per cent rate of VAT would cut circulations by 7 per cent and lead to the closure of 12 or 13 regional dailies and about 100 weekly newspapers. The society has found a disappointing response in its lobbying of MPs - the mood may have swung against newspapers in the wake of revelations about some senior politicians and members of the Royal Family. The Newspaper Society fears that the imposition of VAT - which could also be charged on free papers - would amount to as much as Pounds 500m a year. Relaunching its campaign, the society said it believed 'that sufficient evidence now existed that VAT on newspapers, books and magazines was again on the chancellor's Budget agenda'.</p>

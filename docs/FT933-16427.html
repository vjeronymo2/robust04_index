			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / International Company News: Stena Line plans radical strategy switch STENA LINE, the Swedish ferry group, is to announce a radical change of strategy next week which could involve ordering the world's first fleet of high-speed ferries capable of carrying goods vehicles. The company and its UK subsidiary, Stena Sealink Line, said they would make an announcement on Tuesday that would have implications for the world's ferry industry. There was speculation this could mean ordering craft technically ahead of high-speed ferries such as the catamarans operated by Sea Containers, the Bermuda-based shipping group.</p>

			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Transfer Technology ahead to Pounds 5.5m Transfer Technology, which changed its name from Central &amp; Sheerwood last May following reorganisation and the decision to concentrate on specialised engineering, made pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.51m in 1991. Before the acquisitions of TransTec and the PSS group, C&amp;S made pre-tax profits for 1990 of Pounds 2.94m. On a pro forma annualised basis 1990 profits would have been Pounds 3.5m. Mr Geoffrey Robinson, chairman, said the group came through 1991 with much improved results thanks to tight cost controls, good gross margins and a strong position in export markets; more than 75 per cent of the TransTec Group output is exported and in the control technology division over 95 per cent is exported with an average gross margin of 50 per cent. The dividend is increased from 10p to 13p with a recommended final of 6.75p, after adjusting for the consolidation and subdivision of the 1p ordinary into 50p ordinary shares. Earnings emerged at 40p (31p).</p>

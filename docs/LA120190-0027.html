			<p><P> December 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STANFORD RALLIES, BEATS LONG BEACH WOMEN, 79-72  </P> <P> Cal State Long Beach was playing its second consecutive game against a top-10  opponent, the defending NCAA champion -- one that had already lost its opener,  badly.  </P> <P> So it was no surprise that probability caught up with the 49ers at Long Beach.  </P> <P> Stanford came back from a 10-point first-half deficit to win its first game of  the season, 79-72.  </P> <P> The Cardinal had lost by 15 points last week to No. 6 Tennessee and the 49ers  had upset No. 7 Texas, 80-74.  </P> <P> "Personally, I think this game was won in practice this week," Stanford Coach  Tara VanDerveer said. "We were embarrassed last week in Tennessee. I saw a  different commitment from everybody."  </P> <P> Said Long Beach Coach Joan Bonvicini: "I was disappointed in our turnovers,  which I think doubled in the second half (the 49ers had 13 in each half). We  outrebounded them, 67-35 -- that's crazy."  </P> <P> So thought the screaming crowd of 1,749, who watched as the Cardinal, sparked  by the inside play of forward Julie Zeilstra, tied the game, 43-43, with 16:33  remaining after trailing, 41-36, at halftime.  </P> <P> Stanford came back by applying more pressure in the second half, thus  effectively shutting down the 49er fast break, which VanDerveer calls "the best  in the game."  </P> <P> Sophomore guard Molly Goodenbour -- who scored a career-high 14 points -- made  the first of three key three-point baskets with 13:46 to go, and the Cardinal  led the rest of the game.  </P> <P> Zeilstra led all scorers with 22 points. Center Val Whiting had 17 points and  nine rebounds.  </P> <P> Long Beach was led by guard Trise Jackson with 19 points.  </P> <P> Penny Moore had 16 rebounds and Kari Parriott had 14.  </P></p>

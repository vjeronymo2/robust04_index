			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> OPRAH BUYS HOUSE FOR HER DAD  </P> <P> Talk show hostess Oprah Winfrey has purchased a $330,000 house in this  Nashville bedroom community for her father, a city councilman who runs a  barbershop.  </P> <P> Vernon Winfrey, however, said he is unsure when he'll move into the two-story  brick house, since it would force him to give up his council seat in Nashville.  </P> <P> "It's there for Oprah if she wants to come back and stay, or it's there for  me," he said Tuesday.  </P> <P> "I don't plan to move there tomorrow, but the possibility is there that I might  move one day. In the meantime, I might use it as sort of a little getaway on  the weekends."  </P></p>

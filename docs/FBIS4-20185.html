			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, April 27 (A.A.) -- A section of the high  tension lines that supply electricity to the Kurds of Northern  Iraq as part of the humanitarian aid from Turkey was bombed and  destroyed by terrorists.    Foreign Ministry spokesman Ferhat Ataman told a weekly press  conference today that the separatist terrorist organization PKK  [Workers Party of Kurdistan] had destroyed the Silopi-Zakho part  of the line for the second time Sunday [24 April].    After destroying the line, the terrorists also set landmines  in the region to prevent teams from repairing the line.    `This action against the people of Northern Iraq, should be  a  regrettable incident which should teach everyone a lesson,'  Ataman said.    Ataman added that the line would be repaired at the soonest,  to supply power to the people Northern Iraqis, as part of  Turkey's humanitarian assistance to those people.    Ataman went on to say that ambassadors from 16 countries  were  called to Ankara for an evaluation meeting which will take place  on May 4.    The meeting will review Turkey's relations with the West  from  the point-of-view of security and politics.    Ataman said that Turkey was placing intensive emphasis on  the  Iranians who were wounded during Turkey's cross-border operation  on the terrorist camp near Zhala which is on the Iran/Iraq  border.    He added that the compensation claims of Iran were under  evaluation.</p>

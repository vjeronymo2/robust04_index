			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Shevtsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 20 TASS -- The parliament of the Crimea,  an autonomous republic of Ukraine, voted on Friday to restore  the Crimean Constitution of May 6, 1992. Votes against it were  cast only by 14 deputies from the Crimean Tatars," ITAR-TASS has  learned by telephone from Petr Chernyakevich, the Crimean  president's aide for military affairs. [no opening quotation  marks as received]    Chernyakevich described the parliament's decision to restore  the 1992 Constitution as a correct step. "If this decision had  been blackballed," Chernyakevich said, "the Ukrainian president  would have obtained additional means to influence the situation  on the peninsula."    Speaking about the current situation in the Crimea,  Chernyakevich noted that it was on the whole tranquil. In his  opinion, this was largely due to the mass media, which drew  public attention to Ukraine's recent steps, which could have  destabilised the situation in the Crimea.    At the same time, Chernyakevich noted that movements and  redeployment of Ukrainian troops were spotted on the border with  the Crimean republic. It is reported that the Ukrainians are  setting up field hospitals and are trying to place Crimean  defence units under the control of the Ukrainian National Guard.    Chernyakevich also expressed anxiety about the Ukrainian  president's decree to reorganise the Crimean ministries for  internal affairs, security and justice into departments  subordinated to the central Ukrainian ministries.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Macedonian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Z. Skerlev report: "Concern About Greece's Embargo"] </F>   [Text] Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov yesterday  received Hans van den Broek, EU commissioner for foreign  affairs, who stayed in Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia -- FYROM] on his arrival from Athens. According to  the information released by the cabinet of the President, Mr.  van den Broek transmitted the Greek answer to the written  message conveyed by President Gligorov to Greek Prime Minister  Papandreou. The meeting, aimed at searching for solutions to  problems in Macedonian-Greek relations, and which started two  days ago, was continued with the participation of Foreign  Minister Branko Crvenkovski.    Before his departure for Brussels, EU Commissioner Van den  Broek gave a statement to journalists at the Skopje Airport.  "There is good reason to hope we will find mechanisms for  restarting the dialogue between Greece and this Republic;  however, there are still important problems to be solved," he  said. "I do not underestimate the problem with the measures  taken by Greece against this Republic, which have burdened the  possibilities for deblocking the situation. In any case, we  would once again like to make a serious review of the situation,  and in Brussels we shall submit a report to the ministers and  then see what can be done further on.    "I am grateful for the cooperation we had here, as well as  for the willingness to continue our common search for a  solution."    Asked when the embargo of Greece against Macedonia would be  lifted, van den Broek stated:    "One thing is sure: We shall have to look deeper into the  arguments presented by the Greek Government. As far as the  European Commission is concerned, we shall review them as soon  as we get the message from Prime Minister Papandreou, and then  we shall also try to see the possible consequences.    "I must repeat that we are very much concerned about the  possible negative effect of these measures on the country and  the stability in the region, and apparently we shall have to  follow the situation very closely.    "It is also clear that the problem standing behind them  should keep our attention," van den Broek said. "I repeat, if  the question about the measures can be solved, then I shall be a  greater optimist and I shall have greater hopes that there will  be clear perspectives for ending this dispute, this struggle,  which is a bad thing for both countries, as well as for the  security and stability in the region."    The Greek journalists wanted to know whether the European  Union would sign a commercial agreement with Macedonia. Van den  Broek replied he certainly hoped it could be possible, because  the Union has signed agreements with other countries, too. "We  need a consensus for this," he said, "but my experience is that  a commercial cooperation with this country is important for the  future and we shall urge the things as much as possible.  Nevertheless, I also have the feeling that significant progress  in the solution of the bilateral problems must be achieved, and  I am convinced that we shall undounbtedly receive cooperation  for that from this government."    Despite the fact that van den Broek did not answer the  question whether and when he would visit Skopje and Athens  again, as we have found out, that possibility remains open and  real.  <H5>  [Box, p 2] </H5> <H5>  It Is Difficult To Talk Under Embargo </H5>   Macedonian Foreign Minister Stevo Crvenkovski escorted Mr.  van den Broek to Skopje Airport and gave a short statement.    Asked about the results after the visit of van den Broek,  Crvenkovski answered that long discussions were held with the  European Commissioner and that he was very well acquainted with  our stances expressed at the meeting of yesterday and the one of  two days ago. "On our side," Crvenkovski said, "we explicitly  stated we were ready to cooperate with him in solving all these  problems. Nonetheless, we were also explicit that we find  ourselves in an almost impossible situation to continue normally  any discussions under the pressure of the embargo."    Concerning the possible positive elements in  Macedonian-Greek  relations, Crvenkovski assessed that there are positive elements  in the very fact that van den Broek was engaged in the  discussions and in the fact that the European Union was engaged  in searching for an outcome of the whole situation. "Moreover,"  Crvenkovski said, "Mr. van den Broek is in constant contact with  Mr. Cyrus Vance in New York, who is the main mediator in the  dispute, and it certainly is a positive element. At this  moment, I am really not able to say anything more."</p>

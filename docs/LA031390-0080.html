			<p><P> March 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN GRITTY CITY, SOMETHING TO CHEER ABOUT;  </P> <P> REACTION: OAKLAND IS PLAGUED BY SOCIAL PROBLEMS. THE RETURN OF THE RAIDERS WILL  GIVE MANY OF ITS RESIDENTS A NEEDED MORALE BOOST.  </P> <P> Anyone familiar with this gritty city knows too well its litany of problems,  including a criminal investigation of corruption in the school system, a county  health system crippled by a lack of money and a crack epidemic, and a downtown  devastated by last fall's earthquake.  </P> <P> But Oakland, which has had more than its share of ills, finally had something  to cheer about Monday -- the announced return of its treasured football team.  </P> <P> "It'll boost everything -- make the city proud again," declared Anthony Davis,  32, a city maintenance worker.  </P> <P> In the downtown area, word spread quickly that Oakland Mayor Lionel Wilson and  Alameda County Supervisor Don Perata had announced that Al Davis would bring  the Raiders "home."  </P> <P> In the euphoria of the moment, many officials and football fans assumed that  approval was a formality, as indeed it turned out to be. But a few sounded a  note of caution, citing the potential that taxpayers would have to pay off the  bonds used to raise money to refurbish the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum.  </P> <P> "A lot of people are not sure that it's a good deal," said Assemblyman Elihu M.  Harris (D-Oakland), a candidate for mayor. "The economics are marginal at best.  The question is: Will the emotion win over the economics?"  </P> <P> Additionally, some football fans aren't sure that Davis will win their loyalty  quite so easily. Dante Polk, 21, and his friend, Mohumah Demiz, 22, recalled  that as kids they would do whatever it took to see their team, including  hopping the fences to get into the coliseum.  </P> <P> "Now, if they opened the fence, I don't think I'd go," Demiz said. As he sees  it, Davis used Oakland to win a good deal from Los Angeles, and is using  Oakland again. "Oakland was true to the Raiders, but Al Davis was not true to  Oakland," Demiz said.  </P> <P> Still, a return of the football team that gave the city its identity would  "give people something to talk about other than crack," said Polk. As it is,  when outsiders hear of Oakland, the news too often is of "thugs and drugs."  </P> <P> The Raiders left an area after the 1981 season that had given them years of  sellout crowds. With a reputation for tough play and wild antics, the team was  among the most successful franchises in sports history.  </P> <P> "Al Davis developed a particular mystique -- the guy from the other side of the  track who has to fight in order to survive, the underdog fighting his way to  the top, fighting the establishment," noted Robert Nahas, former president of  the Oakland-Alameda Coliseum Commission, who fought to keep the team here.  </P> <P> That image played especially well in Oakland, which long fought to get out from  the shadow of the more glamorous San Francisco. Although Davis left for Los  Angeles, fans never gave up.  </P> <P> Sports bars prospered by identifying with the team. A newsletter gave voice to  the hope that the Raiders would return. Die-hards traveled 400 miles to watch  their beloved team play in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> For local officials, Nahas said, "it is a matter of ego. We lost it and we want  it back." As for the fans, they're "longing for the most exciting team in  football. They're hoping to see that again."  </P> <P> If Davis carries through on his apparent pledge to return, he will face a very  different and more competitive market. The San Francisco 49ers are the "Team of  the '80s," having won the Super Bowl earlier this year, and three championships  in the 1980s, while the Oakland A's are the baseball champions.  </P> <P> The city also has gone through changes. It has experienced an erosion of  blue-collar jobs, a trend expected to continue if the federal government  follows through with its plan to close several military bases in the East Bay.  Meanwhile, white-collar, service-oriented jobs have been on the upswing.  </P> <P> The Oct. 17 earthquake caused $1.3 billion in damage in Oakland, forcing  closure of 213 commercial buildings, many of them downtown. City Hall itself is  closed. Fifteen residential hotels that housed some of the city's poorest  residents also were shuttered.  </P> <P> The Alameda County district attorney's office continues an investigation of  low-level corruption at the Oakland school district, where 13 employees have  been arrested. A top Alameda County health official estimated that the main  public hospital needs $25 million to meet state standards.  </P> <P> But while problems seem to have multiplied in the past year, Oakland business  executives say they are bullish.  </P> <P> "Almost by any measure, we are doing better than we were in 1981," said James  A. Vohs, chairman and chief executive officer of Kaiser Foundation Health Plans  Inc. "I think (the Raiders) are coming back to a healthier city."  </P> <P> Davis will find a larger market than the one he left. Much of the growth in the  Bay Area is taking place in the East Bay. Oakland's population, which is about  350,000, is expected to grow by about 5% over the next 15 years. But adjacent  Contra Costa County is expected to grow by 28%, and some Alameda County suburbs  are expected to grow 32% to 74%, regional planners have said.  </P> <P> If the National Football League franchise returns, Don Moroni can claim some  credit. Through his newsletter, Sports Page News, he gathered 48,000 names on  petitions demanding that officials enter into talks with Davis.  </P> <P> Moroni, who owns a printing company, recalled that when he began the campaign,  "People laughed us out of the arena." They would say, " 'Al Davis is never  coming back. You people are a joke.' " As he saw it, however, "it was a  fundamental issue of representation." The fans had spoken and forced the  officials to try to win back the team. "The Raiders belong here. The Raiders  put Oakland on the map nationally."  </P> <P> Whether Davis can reclaim that past glory remains to be seen. Milton Young,  bartender at the Oakland sports bar, King's X, said he is not one of the fans  who will pay for a game ticket that local officials say will average $55.  </P> <P> "Davis is a guy who has everything going his own way," said Young, a 49ers fan.  "I'd like to have someone tell him to take his team and stick it. . . . The  people in Oakland are a little disgusted."  </P></p>

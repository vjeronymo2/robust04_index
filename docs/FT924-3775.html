			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / International Company News: Porsche cuts preference payout PORSCHE, the loss-making German sports-car manufacturer, is to pay a DM2.50 per share dividend on its preference shares, down from DM10 in the previous year. The group is not making any payment on its ordinary shares, owned exclusively by the Porsche and Piech families and on which the dividend was DM9 in 1990-91. The founding families own what is reported to be 40 per cent of the preference shares. The rest are owned by the general public and institutional investors. There had been fears that the payout would have been missed because of the company's worsening business difficulties. To counter the business problems, the company has plans to cut 1,850 jobs in the course of this year, almost a quarter of the workforce. As it is unusual to put the interests of shareholders ahead of those of the workforce, it was thought possible that the company would reduce the dividend at a time when the workforce has been cut back. However, another factor is that if the dividend on the non-voting preference share is missed for two years in a row, the preference shares convert into ordinary voting shares.</p>

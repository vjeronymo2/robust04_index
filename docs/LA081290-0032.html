			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WASHINGTON;  </P> <P> BILLS SEEK STIFFER PENALTIES -- INCLUDING PRISON -- FOR JOB-SAFETY VIOLATIONS  </P> <P> After turning into a paper tiger during the Reagan Administration, the  Occupational Safety and Health Act may get some teeth back, courtesy of  Congress.  </P> <P> Three bills take separate approaches to reinvigorating OSHA:  </P> <P> * A measure sponsored by Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D-Ohio) would change employer  violations of OSHA that result in death to a felony from a misdemeanor. Under  current law, the maximum penalty is no more than six months in prison. The new  proposal (S. 2154) would boost the maximum to 10 years for a first offense and  20 years for a second. Maximum fines would rise to $250,000 from $10,000 for  each violation.  </P> <P> In addition, the law now contains no criminal penalty covering serious injuries  on the job. The Metzenbaum bill would punish willful violations of OSHA that  result in serious injury with up to five years in prison for a first offense  and 10 years for a second.  </P> <P> * Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.) is sponsoring a bill (S. 490) to adjust OSHA's  civil penalties, which have not changed in 20 years, to keep pace with  inflation. Violators are now subject to fines of up to $1,000 for each  violation and up to $10,000 for each "willful or repeated" violation. The bill  would increase the maximum fines to $3,000 and $30,000, respectively.  </P> <P> * Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.) has proposed legislation (S. 2442) to give victims  of accidents in the workplace, or their families, the right to participate in  OSHA's investigative hearing process. Currently, the sessions are effectively  closed, and victims and their families must even pay for copies of citations  and reports.  </P> <P> Simon's and Metzenbaum's bills are the most controversial, yet both passed the  Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee by a strong bipartisan vote. The  Lautenberg bill is still in committee.  </P> <P> Organized labor led the fight for safer working conditions in the 1960s, which  resulted in the creation of OSHA in 1970. The law was designed to enforce  health and safety standards on the job through inspections and civil remedies.  Possible criminal cases are referred to the Justice Department. But statistics  show that few OSHA cases are sent to Justice.  </P> <P> For instance, from 1983 to 1989, referrals by the EPA resulted in 520  indictments and 400 convictions. From 1970 to 1988, there were only 14 criminal  indictments resulting from OSHA violations, and they resulted in just 10  convictions. No one was jailed.  </P> <P> "If we can throw corporate criminals in jail for harming air, water, land and  animals, then we can throw corporate criminals in jail for killing and maiming  our working men and women," said Metzenbaum.  </P> <P> It wasn't until last year, when Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole issued orders to  step up enforcement, that the first employer was jailed for an OSHA violation  -- 45 days for responsibility in a trench cave-in that killed a worker.  </P> <P> "When you analyze the data, there is no way the political establishment can  defend the status quo," said Joseph Kinney, who founded the National Safe  Workplace Institute in Chicago after his brother fell to his death from faulty  scaffolding and the employer was fined $800.  </P> <P> According to Kinney's institute, the United States ranks fourth-highest out of  22 countries in the number of deaths on the job, and a U.S. worker is 5.8 times  likelier to die from job-related injuries than a Swedish worker.  </P> <P> Margaret Seminario, director of the occupational safety and health department  at the AFL-CIO, said the toll of injuries among American workers is staggering.  She said 10,000 workers die of injuries on the job each year, 70,000 are  permanently disabled and 6 million are injured.  </P> <P> At a recent Senate hearing, Charlene Gadsen of Bridgeport, Conn., told how her  father fell 70 feet to his death from a bridge that he had been told to  dismantle without safety nets or ropes. OSHA has proposed fining the employer  $20,000, but the employer is protesting the amount.  </P> <P> Roxanne DeLuise of Allentown, Pa., testified about the death of her 32-year-old  husband, who suffered third-degree burns over 95% of his body in a work  accident. His employer was fined $1,000.  </P> <P> "How can we have a Constitution that provides for life, liberty and pursuit of  happiness when we have situations where workers have become expendable?" she  asked in an emotional appeal that left many in the room in tears.  </P> <P> Opposition to Metzenbaum's proposal is coming from leading business groups: the  U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Assn. of Manufacturers and the  Associated General Contractors of America.  </P> <P> "The OSHA statute was intended to abate hazards and resolve safety problems  quickly," said Jeff Perlman, manager of legal and regulatory affairs at the  chamber. "But with criminal statutes like this, the current attitude of  cooperation between business and government would be changed to one of  confrontation. Today almost no one asks OSHA inspectors for a warrant, but with  Metzenbaum's bill employers would be reluctant to let OSHA on the scene if  there has been an accident."  </P> <P> The chamber has no official position on the other two pieces of legislation.  The National Assn. of Manufacturers also opposes Metzenbaum's bill, but NAM  lobbyist Cynthia Witkins said the group would not object to Lautenberg's  proposal to increase civil penalties.  </P> <P> Similarly, the Bush Administration has voiced support for increasing civil  fines while opposing portions of the other two bills.  </P> <P> Gerard Scannell, the Labor Department official in charge of OSHA, echoed the  chamber's Perlman in saying that the Metzenbaum proposal would make it more  difficult to achieve compliance with the act's civil sections.  </P> <P> And in a letter to Simon, Dole said the Labor Department would not support his  legislation because OSHA has already improved its relationship with victims and  their families through "formal administrative means."  </P> <P> Although acknowledging that improvements have been made, Simon said the rights  of victims must be written into law to ensure that the policy is not changed  should OSHA once again lapse into being a paper tiger.  </P></p>

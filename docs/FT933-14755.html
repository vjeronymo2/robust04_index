			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Peers clash as Maastricht pressure grows MR JOHN MAJOR was last night under pressure from pro-European ministers to declare that he is ready if necessary to risk the imposition in Britain of the social chapter rather than abandon ratification of the Maastricht treaty. The mobilisation of the Europhiles in the Tory party was also reflected in the counter-attack by Conservative heavyweights against Lady Thatcher's decision to vote for a referendum on Maastricht when the issue is put to the House of Lords tomorrow. Downing Street refused to comment on mounting speculation at Westminster that a combination of opposition parties and rebellious Tory Euro-sceptics could defeat the government in a Commons vote on the social chapter on July 26. Euro-sceptics described a government defeat as 'a racing certainty' even if ministers managed to persuade some unionist MPs not to vote with the opposition. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, was said to be among the ministers who want Mr Major to make it clear in advance of the vote that whatever the outcome the government will press ahead with ratification. The ministers hope that such a threat will dissuade the Euro-sceptics from voting for the inclusion of the social chapter in the belief that Mr Major would then abandon the treaty. But Mr Clarke is said to be among a majority who believe that even if the government is defeated it should press ahead with ratification. Initially the government could ignore the Commons vote - as it is technically outside the ratification legislation - but it might then be open to a legal challenge to the social chapter opt-out. The pro-European majority in the cabinet is arguing that if the UK were then forced to abandon the opt-out, the blame would fall directly on the Euro-sceptics. Ways of minimising the controversy of ratifying the treaty, even after a Commons defeat, are at the heart of contingency plans being drawn up by the government. One proposal is for a vote of confidence to be taken immediately after any defeat. This would bring back into line at least some of the Tory rebels, and might be framed to include an endorsement of the government's stance on the social chapter. Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, is said to have advised colleagues that ratifying the treaty in spite of a defeat would not worsen the government's position in the threatened Euro-sceptic attempt to seek judicial review of what the government has done so far in its pursuit of ratification. Tory sensitivities about Maastricht were underlined as former cabinet ministers accused Lady Thatcher of disloyalty, even though the government is confident that her call for a referendum will be defeated. Lord Howe, the former chancellor and foreign secretary, said that if her predecessor had led an organised rebellion during her own premiership, then she would have regarded it as 'pretty disloyal'. He gave a warning that to embark on a referendum campaign would be 'total folly'. Lord Gilmour rejected Lady Thatcher's assertion that her support for a Maastricht referendum would not be an attack on Mr John Major. The pro-referendum lobby stepped up its pressure yesterday. Lord Blake, the Tory historian who will move the amendment, called it a campaign of 'peers for the people'.</p>

			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / International Company News: Renault truck arm tumbles FFr1.62bn into the red RENAULT Vehicules Industriels, the French truckmaker, yesterday announced a FFr1.62bn (Dollars 287m) net loss for 1992. Turnover fell by 8 per cent with a 38 per cent drop in European sales in the second half. Mr Jean-Pierre Capron, RVI president, said he hoped that balance might be restored in the second half of this year. But as a measure of the depth of the recession into which the European truck market had now fallen, he said RVI's sales for both the last six months of 1992 and the first six months of this year would only total what the company had sold in the first half of 1990 alone. The only bright spot was the relative success of the US subsidiary, Mack Trucks, in cutting its operating loss from Dollars 195m in 1991 to Dollars 145m last year. The US company had been set the goal, in a recovering market, of returning to profit in 1994, Mr Capron said. The group's FFr1.62bn net loss follows a FFr23m net profit in 1991, and includes FFr612m worth of provisions to cover restructuring. This will cut its French workforce by a further 1,348 jobs this year after 1,008 job losses in 1992 and a decision to end vehicle assembly in the UK. Mr Shemaya Levy, director of RVI's European operations, said that from its 1989 peak of 311,000 truck sales, the European truck market would fall from 260,000 last year to 220,000 this year. Last year, RVI held its fourth position among European truck makers, but its share fell from 10.5 per cent in 1991 to 9.2 per cent. This resulted from the above-average decline in the French and Spanish markets where Renault is particularly strong, and the fact that the French truckmaker is still trying to expand in Germany, whose post-unification market last year accounted for 40 per cent of all sales in Europe. 'We have adjusted our production to a demand that almost vanished in the second half of last year,' Mr Capron said. 'As a result, our operations dwindled to a level we had never experienced in the past and that generated considerably higher costs'.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> ["Sampling the 64-Mbit Chip"] </F>   [Text] Scha. FRANKFURT. The first, fully  functional 64-Mbit memory chips, developed jointly by Siemens  and IBM, have now been delivered to key customers. The sampling  and examination of the chips should provide information on what  and where changes are to be made. In its newsletter of January  1994, Siemens reported that following a successful pilot run,  the technology will be converted into a production line, which  will require investments of about one billion US dollars.  Subsequent technological advances, such as the joint development  by IBM, Siemens, and Toshiba of circuits having structural  widths of 0.25 micrometers, will then be undertaken in Dresden  as well. The market research company, Dataquest, predicts that  by 1997, as many as 40 million 64-Mbit chips may have been sold  on the world market.</p>

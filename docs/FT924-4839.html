			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / International Company News: Ahold defies weak dollar with 6.1% profit advance AHOLD, the Dutch food retailer with half its sales along the US east coast, reported a 6.1 per cent rise in net profit for the third quarter, despite the dollar's weakness. Net profit rose to Fl 66.7m (Dollars 37m) from Fl 62.9m a year ago, when the dollar stood 15 per cent higher than in the most recent quarter. Had the dollar not declined, net profit would have risen by a further Fl 5m, the company said. Sales in local currencies were higher in both the Netherlands and the US, where Ahold owns four supermarket chains. But the lower dollar meant that group turnover fell to Fl 4.8bn from Fl 5bn. In the Netherlands, where Aholds operates Albert Heijn, the biggest supermarket chain, sales rose 4.5 per cent to Fl 2.4bn. US sales increased by 3.3 per cent to Dollars 1.4bn. Operating profit fell to Fl 110.6m from Fl 112m, again reflecting the effect of the lower dollar. In local currencies, Dutch operating profit was up 14 per cent at Fl 47.8m, while US results posted a 6.2 per cent gain to Dollars 38.3m. Ahold's nine-month net profit stands at Fl 220.2m, an 8.1 per cent rise on the same period of 1991.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague May 30 (CTK) -- Czech Deputy Foreign  Minister Alexandr Vondra and Chairman of the German Bundestag's  Foreign Committee Hans Stercken met today to discuss European  framework to Czech-German relations.    The valid Czech-German treaty, which forms the basis of  mutual relations, certainly does not settle everything, but  supposes that many questions felt by some people as a burden,  will be solved or "dissolved" in the European framework, Vondra  said. He stressed that the word "Sudeten German" had not been  pronounced at all during the one-hour meeting.    As for the compensation of the Czech victims of the Nazi  regime, Vondra said that any dramatic progress in the issue  could be hardly expected in 1994, the year described in Germany  as a "superelection" one.    He said he believed it was necessary to cultivate  Czech-German relations and strive for progress feasible and  acceptable on both sides. Some steps taken recently by the  Czech Foreign Ministry and those envisaged by the government are  aimed to support these tasks, Vondra added. As an example he  gave the humanitarian gesture (financial support) towards the  Czech citizens affected by the Nazi occupation, which can a  little bit ease the "artificially raised tension".    "It is only necessary that Czech-German relations are good,  and that nobody expects what cannot be expected in the nearest  future, and that the relations are not somehow impaired due to  the excessive and sometimes also unfeasible expectations,"  Vondra stated.    Stercken said the Czech Republic should have a clear idea of  what it could do to ensure its interests, including those in  relation to the European Union (EU). He said he accepted it  with understanding that the Czech Government had not yet applied  for EU membership, as everybody knew that the time would come  when the Czech Republic would meet conditions for admission.    He would be glad, he said, if Germany became the fourth  country to ratify the agreement on the Czech Republic's  association with the EU. Bundestag should do so in the nearest  future. Stercken said he favoured "gradual association".</p>

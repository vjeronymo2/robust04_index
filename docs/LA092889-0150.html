			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FORMER HUD AIDE REFUSES TO ANSWER QUESTIONS  </P> <P> A former aide to ex-Housing Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr. followed Pierce's  example Wednesday and refused to answer House investigators' questions,  invoking the Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination.  </P> <P> Lance Wilson, who is accused of profiting handsomely from his government  service, appeared under subpoena a day after Pierce had exercised his  constitutional right to remain silent about his eight-year tenure at the  Department of Housing and Urban Development.  </P> <P> Like his old boss, Wilson accused the House Government Operations subcommittee  that is investigating political favoritism and influence peddling at the  department of prejudging him. But members of the panel dismissed his claims as  self-serving and irrelevant.  </P> <P> Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo), the subcommittee chairman, said that Wilson has  made millions of dollars from HUD-related projects since he left the agency and  has received consulting fees to use his influence with HUD officials, whom he  entertained lavishly on his expense account.  </P> <P> Wilson, now a $325,000-a-year executive with a Wall Street investment firm,  refused to explain what he did to earn a $10,000 check that he received from  retired HUD official Alexander Naclario in May, 1988, when he apparently was  moonlighting from his full-time job with PaineWebber Group Inc.  </P> <P> Naclario, taking the stand after Wilson was excused, said that he paid Wilson  the money to end the opposition of Hunter Cushing, former deputy assistant  secretary of housing, to an application for FHA mortgage insurance on a big New  York City apartment project.  </P> <P> Another HUD official, Naclario testified, told him that Cushing had asked why  he should help Naclario.  </P> <P> Naclario said that he then called Wilson and offered him $10,000 to persuade  Cushing to drop his opposition. Wilson reported shortly afterward that Cushing  had denied making any such remark and would not oppose the application if the  HUD technical staff approved it, Naclario said.  </P> <P> Cushing, now an official with the Commerce Department, previously invoked the  Fifth Amendment to avoid self-incrimination when he was called to testify  before the congressional panel.  </P> <P> Earlier, Naclario said, he was summoned to Washington in 1982 by Wilson to help  get HUD approval for a project in Puerto Rico that was backed by a major  political contributor to George Bush, then vice president.  </P> <P> He traveled to the island and met the contributor, Delio Rojo, Naclario said,  and found that the proposed housing project for the elderly was to be located  in a building that included a gambling casino, restaurants and swimming pools.  </P> <P> To meet HUD requirements for subsidized housing, he said, he recommended that  the casino, pools and restaurants be regarded as "off-site" properties that  would pay rent to the project to reduce the amount of rents paid by low-income  persons.  </P> <P> In another case, he said, he paid Wilson $5,000 for helping another  unidentified Puerto Rican developer with a HUD grant application.  </P> <P> In his opening remarks, Lantos said that Wilson played a key role in pushing an  application by Leonard Briscoe, a Ft. Worth, Tex., developer, for a $7-million  HUD urban development grant.  </P> <P> "The . . . project was awarded funds over the strong objection of the HUD  regional office career staff, who viewed the project as ill-conceived,  ill-designed and undercapitalized," Lantos said. Wilson refused to answer a  question about the Briscoe grant.  </P> <P> After leaving HUD, Lantos said, Wilson received a 15% interest from Briscoe in  another development in Florida worth about $3.5 million.  </P> <P> Since he began work at PaineWebber in 1986, the subcommittee chairman said,  Wilson has spent more than $10,000 on lunches, dinners and receptions for HUD  employees, including a $1,000 dinner for his hand-picked successor at HUD,  Deborah Gore Dean. Earlier, Dean also invoked the Fifth Amendment.  </P></p>

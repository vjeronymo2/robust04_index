			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GULF CRISIS SPARKS INTEREST IN CLASSES ON MUSLIMS, ISLAM;  </P> <P> MIDEAST: MAINLINE DENOMINATIONS ARE MOVING TO EDUCATE THEIR MEMBERS ON THE  PEOPLE AND RELIGION IN THE AREA OF CONTENTION.  </P> <P> Mainline denominations across the country are taking steps to educate their  members about the Muslim culture and the Islamic religion because of U.S.  involvement in the Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> Churches, synagogues and religious institutions are offering special  instruction during adult Sunday school classes, simple after-church  discussions, seminars and special programs.  </P> <P> "I knew almost nothing about (Islam) before this," said Ken Ioso, who organized  a three-week seminar on Islam for his adult class at Macalister-Plymouth United  Church in St. Paul, Minn.  </P> <P> "We didn't know a lot; we were starting from ground zero," Ioso said.  </P> <P> Acknowledged John Borelli, who is in charge of interreligious relations for the  National Conference of Catholic Bishops: "We as Christians need to learn more  about Islam."  </P> <P> Catholics, Presbyterians, Methodists, the United Church of Christ, the  Disciples of Christ and Jews are among those offering the educational programs.  </P> <P> The Rev. Joseph Bragg's adult church school class at the Avenue Christian  Church in St. Louis, for example, has become a forum for political and ethical  debate on the Persian Gulf crisis.  </P> <P> William Gepford, pastor of a Presbyterian Church in Dearborn, Mich., has given  a dozen speeches on Islam in the last two months and has eight more scheduled  before the end of December. He has had more than 40 requests for information  and appearances at churches and organizations since the crisis. More than 25%  of the city's roughly 86,000 population is Arab-American.  </P> <P> Many people are looking to religious institutions where knowledge "can be  apolitical and unbiased," said Gepford, who is also director of the  Presbyterians' Interfaith Ministry in Detroit.  </P> <P> "People are asking the question, Why are we there?" Gepford said.  </P> <P> Those who have attended the educational programs said they have learned a  variety of things.  </P> <P> Ioso said the classes in St. Paul taught him what the daily life of a Muslim is  like.  </P> <P> Thomas Riggs said he now understands some of the reasons that Saddam Hussein  invaded Kuwait, thanks to classes at his Methodist Church in Ann Arbor.  </P> <P> "Iraq wants an access to the sea," Riggs said. "There is also a big oil field  that straddles the border of Kuwait and Iraq." Riggs' classmate Fay Kincaid  said she gained a clearer view of how the Arab population looked at the  situation in the Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> "Now, our real object is what we can do to have peace there," Kincaid said.  </P> <P> A basic study book on Islam, called "God is One," is still a bestseller after  being on the market for almost two years -- an almost unheard-of selling stint  for its Christian publisher. Requests for the book, published by Friendship  Press, which is part of the National Council of Churches, have jumped since  Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.  </P> <P> Bragg, of Avenue Christian Church in St. Louis, teaches from a series of books  and educational materials called "Discipleship Alive!" The series was put  together by an interdenominational group of educators to elicit comments and  discussion about contemporary events like the Gulf situation, he said.  </P> <P> But some Islamic groups and educators worry that much of the material and  information available on Islam is incorrect and biased.  </P> <P> "There is so much misinformation out there," said Scott Easton of the  Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee.  </P> <P> John Woods, director of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at the University  of Chicago, trains public school and religious educators to be become better  instructors on Islam.  </P> <P> "Islam is very misunderstood in this country," said Woods, even though "it is  rapidly becoming the second-largest religion in the country." Woods estimated  that there are about 5 million Muslims in America.  </P> <P> A common misperception is that "if Saddam Hussein is a Muslim, and he does  nasty and brutal things, then anything Muslim is brutal," Woods said.  </P> <P> To help solve the problem, religious groups are seeking local specialists as  instructors. For example, a history professor from the University of Michigan  and other local scholars lectured during last month's study series on the  Persian Gulf at the First United Methodist Church in Ann Arbor.  </P> <P> Organized by the church's Peace Study/Action Committee, the course taught 25  adults about the history, geography and political motivations of Hussein.  </P> <P> Joyce Chesbrough, who attended the classes, said it helped to hear from a  variety of speakers in order to get different viewpoints. "If you get enough of  them, you begin to be able to draw your own conclusions," she said.  </P> <P> The Center for Global Education in Minneapolis has been deluged with more  requests than it can handle from religious and civic organizations seeking  guest speakers and information, said Ann Haften, the center's coordinator for  communication and development.  </P> <P> "A lot of people are starting from scratch," Haften said.  </P> <P> Some groups learn in informal settings, such as the gathering on a recent  Sunday in Louisville, Ky. Christians, Jews and Muslims met at the local mosque  "to address issues related to the Muslim faith," said Bette Levy of the  Interfaith Task Force at the National Conference of Christians and Jews, which  coordinated the event.  </P> <P> Levy said the interdenominational gathering was aimed at combating prejudice  against Arab-Americans. The Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee says  there have been hundreds of reports of hostility and abuse toward  Arab-Americans since the Gulf crisis began, Easton said.  </P> <P> Places such as the Islamic Center of Southern California periodically offer  public forums on timely topics in attempting to offset misconceptions.  </P> <P> As Msgr. Royale Vadakin, an interfaith leader in Los Angeles pointed out, there  is "a vast majority of people in the U.S." don't know that only 18% of all  Muslims are Arabs.  </P> <P> Some Catholic Churches are addressing the Gulf issue in dialogue groups. These  formal discussion groups bring together Muslims and Catholics to help remove  religious stereotypes and sort out political and social questions. The groups  are meeting in several Catholic archdioceses nationwide, including those in Los  Angeles, New York and Chicago.  </P> <P> Rabbi Matthew Simon of B'nai Israel in Rockville, Md., said that since most  synagogues have ongoing adult education classes on comparative religion, the  current Persian Gulf crisis has resulted in few new education programs.  </P> <P> But on Yom Kippur afternoon, the rabbi said, he "taught" his congregation of  1,200 about the historical relationship of Jews and Muslims.  </P></p>

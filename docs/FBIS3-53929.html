			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The Iraqi newspapers AL-'IRAQ, AL-  JUMHURIYAH, and AL-THAWRAH, in their 17 January editions,  commemorate the third anniversary of the Gulf war. The  editorials of these newspapers, as well as several inside  articles, lavish praise on the "Mother of Battles," and commend  the Iraqi leadership's performance during the Gulf crisis and  war. The Baghdad newspapers AL-QADISIYAH and BABIL 17 January  editions, have not thus far been received by Jordan Bureau.    Baghdad AL-JUMHURIYAH, publishes on pages 1, 2, a 600-word  article by Salah al-Mukhtar celebrating the salvation of Iraq  under Iraqi President Saddam Husayn. It says: "Iraq has  survived the military aggression ordeal, during which the  weapons of the 21st century produced to defeat the then second  world superpower (the Soviet Union) were used. The potential  for renaissance and reconstruction in Iraq remained intact.  Thus, Iraq thwarted the centerpiece of the Western-Zionist  scheme, which was the destruction of the potential for  renaissance and progress in Iraq, as well as the elimination of  the creative political and technological mind behind this  renaissance and progress."    The writer describes the "30-state aggression" as an  "existential challenge" that elicited determination and  strengthened the national will to rebuild the country, enhance  steadfastness, and uphold principles, and national independence.  He maintains that Iraq's performance during the Gulf war has  earned it the admiration of "freedom fighters everywhere."  Consequently, the writer argues, world peoples have chosen to  walk the path of national resistance to fight U.S. attempts at  "domination."    The writer cites the examples of starving Somalia and,  alluding to the former Soviet Union, "superpowers" that  disintegrated and became "Third World" nations. He says that  "an open and strong spirit of resistance to U.S. colonialism has  been stepped up. Consequently, U.S. colonialism suffered a  string of abysmal defeats in 1993. For, U.S. agents and the  advocates of (market economy) have been defeated. Moreover, the  forces advocating freedom, socialism, and independence triumphed  in several European states."    The writer contends that these "positive changes, which are  bound to bring closer the dawn of freedom as well as the final  defeat of U.S. colonialism, have taken place because other  peoples have learned the lessons provided by the Mother of  Battles. These peoples have benefited from these lessons in  their struggle against attempts at domination. The major lesson  learned was that steadfastness is the midwife that helps produce  almost impossible results."    Concluding his article, the writer maintains that "the  Achilles heel of U.S. colonialism lies in creating several  Mothers of Battles." He adds: "Each and every people must  prepare for their own Mother of Battles. For, when there are  several resistance arenas all over the world, the United States  will find itself compelled to retreat into its own cocoon as a  result of its intrinsic impotence, and also because it does not  have the components required for colonizing the universe."    An editorial in AL-'IRAQ newspaper, on pages 1, 6, cites  the speech delivered by Iraqi President Saddam Husayn on the  occasion on 16 January 1994, filed as second referent item.    The 600-word editorial commends the "steadfastness and  heroism" demonstrated in the "Mother of Battles." It carries  brief excerpts from the speech Saddam delivered on 16 January  1994. The editorial says: "Erroneous calculations lead to  erroneous results. That is why evildoers, once again, became  hostage to their lopsided and parochial perspective when they  thought that their extraordinary and ferocious aggression was  enough to bring Iraq to its knees so that they could force their  dictates on it, and consequently make an example of it to  terrorize the world, as leader President Saddam Husayn has said  in the historic speech he has delivered marking the third  anniversary of the great showdown of the Mother of Battles."    The editorial maintains that the calculations of the United  States and its allies were mistaken, "thanks to the Iraqis'  nobility, strong faith in the justness of their cause, and their  legendary steadfastness." The editorial describes the "Mother  of Battles" as "the epic of the 20th century."    AL-THAWRAH newspaper, in a 1,500 word editorial on pages 1,  7, commends Iraq's performance during the Gulf crisis and war.  The editorial begins by saying: "January 17, 1991 will  continue to be remembered as the date on which the Arab nation's  collective consciousness was born."    Celebrating this event, the paper says: "The annals of  history have registered that Iraq, in terms of its leaders,  will, human individual, faith, and role, is an unerasable fact  of the age. For 100,000 air raids, which reflect the  colonialist West's utmost evil potential, have failed to dent  Iraq's standing or will. The three years that separate us from  this event only clarify facts. For, the open and disgraceful  subservience to the U.S.-Zionist camp by the Arabs of the desert  has been consummated, whereas Iraq's continuing to uphold honor,  pride, sovereignty, progress, and principles has become an  indisputable fact.    "After three years of hard work, glory, honor, patience,  steadfastness, and sacrifices, the Iraqis, who have upheld the  message, stand firmer and continue to uphold right. Nothing of  all that has happened has undermined the principles of right and  honor. Nothing of that has dented the historicity of the  leadership, nor its glorious and great positions.    "For the past three years, the Iraqis have confirmed to the  whole universe that their progress, standing, and their  credentials to the age of industry is not a product of their  consumption of Western industries and expertise. For, Western  bombs destroyed the Western industry assembled on Iraqi  territory. However, the Iraqis have rebuilt and reconstructed  their industries under the circumstances of a sweeping embargo  to say that new Iraq, the Iraq of Saddam Husayn, is standing on  its feet, that it is in good shape, and that the new Iraqi  individual is the most important element Saddam Husayn has built  on Iraqi territory. "    The editorial underscores Iraq's political discourse, saying  that "all lies have collapsed, that all masks have been torn  apart, and that the confrontation has melted all dyes, and  removed all delusions."    The editorial also assails Iran's involvement in the Gulf  war, saying that this shows that Iran's "medieval perspective is  linked to the West's colonialist plan, which is targeting the  pan-Arab renaissance plan spearheaded and epitomized by Iraq."  The paper says that this indicates that Iran cannot harbor good  intentions for the Arabs and Muslims.    Discussing the same topic in an approximately 900-word  frontpage editorial on 16 January, Baghdad AL-JUMHURIYAH notes  that the "Mother of Battles has produced a new trend in the  world that exposed the falsity of the "New World Order" promoted  by Washington and the Zioniost quarters. The Mother of Battles  has dealt a strong blow to Bush and his allies. It humiliated  them and forced them to admit, secretly and in the open, that  the Iraq of leader Saddam Husayn is a home to the knights and  the mujahidin who have an unyielding will in both the  battlefield and in the fields of work."</p>

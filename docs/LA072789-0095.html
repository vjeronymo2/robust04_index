			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: LEONARD-DURAN WILL BE FOR AT LEAST ONE WBC TITLE  </P> <P> Sugar Ray Leonard and Roberto Duran announced plans Wednesday to fight for at  least one, and possibly two, World Boxing Council titles.  </P> <P> Mike Trainer, Leonard's attorney, whose Victory Promotions will co-promote the  bout with Bob Arum's Top Rank Inc., said in New York that if the fight is held  at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, it will be Nov. 2; if it is bought by Donald  Trump's Trump Plaza in Atlantic City, N.J., it will be held Nov. 30, and should  it be held at Steve Wynn's new Mirage at Las Vegas, it would be in the first  week of December.  </P> <P> Trainer wouldn't say what the boxers would earn, but did say that Leonard would  get both a guarantee and a percentage, and that most of Duran's money would  come from his guarantee.  </P> <P> Trainer added that the fight could be for both the WBC middleweight and  super-middleweight titles but that, for now, it will be only for Leonard's  168-pound super-middleweight title. Lindell Holmes of Detroit, No. 1 ranked  middleweight, is insisting that Duran make a mandatory defense against him for  the 160-pound title.  </P> <P> Duran, who is 85-7, handed Leonard the only defeat of his 35-1-1 career in  1980, then quit against Leonard in the rematch later that year.  </P></p>

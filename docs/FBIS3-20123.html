"That is what is  natural," Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland said.    If it is at all possible, she will this week call a meeting  of party leaders and representatives of No to the EU and of the  Europe Movement to discuss the matter.    "I will of course listen to what they have to say about the  date for a Norwegian referendum. But for me it is natural that  our referendum should come after the referendum Sweden will hold  on 13 November."    Brundtland pointed to the fact that the government has long  held the view that the referendum should be held around six  months after the membership agreement is finalized and has been  debated by the European Parliament. Strasbourg's scrutiny of  the agreement is planned to be complete by 4 May.    What is most likely is that the Norwegian referendum will  come one or at most two weeks after the Swedish referendum. A  later date would be difficult if the timetable of Norwegian  membership from 1 January 1995 is to be met, because the  Storting needs time for the necessary ratification of the  agreement after the referendum has been held.    Brundtland justified her view of the order of the  referendums  with the argument that Norway applied for membership after  Sweden and Finland, and that the decision for a Norwegian  membership application was to a large extent reached as a result  of the fact that Norway's two Nordic neighbors had applied for  membership. She therefore takes the view that it is natural for  Norwegian voters also to know the outcome of the referendums in  the other Nordic applicant countries before they make up their  minds about Norwegian membership. Finland will probably hold  its referendum in September.    The annual general meeting of the Rogaland Labor Party did  not reach any decision about a date for a referendum, while the  Hordaland Labor Party yesterday voted to back a referendum after  the Swedes and the Finns have voted. Hordaland Labor Party  attaches importance to the significance the result in Sweden  will have for many Norwegian voters.    After the prime minister has heard the views of parties and  organizations on the date for a referendum, the government will  be swift to recommend a date. The prime minister announced that  this recommendation will be made public before the draft bill  for a referendum is completed. This will be submitted to the  Storting in the course of its spring session. The government  already has a majority in the Storting backing the proposal for  a Norwegian referendum after the Swedish referendum.    The prime minister told the annual general meeting of the  Rogaland Labor Party yesterday about how she herself overcame  her doubts and said yes in 1972 [year of Norway's previous  referendum on EC/EU membership]. She reached her final decision  at a gathering at which each of the guests had to outline their  views.    "One of the contributions made a strong impression on me and  finally helped me to reach a decision. The person in question  said that he was against membership, because otherwise we could  run the risk of bumping into Germans and Italians when hiking on  the Hardanger mountain plateau. Then I realized that I would  have to think about the future, about the fact that we also have  to embrace people from other countries, and that you cannot  simply build socialism Norwegian-style. The Nordic countries  must make their contribution when it comes to creating peace and  security in Europe. In the next round it is the former  communist countries in East Europe that are knocking on the door  to ensure a better future for their children," Brundtland said.    In the same way that her doubts finally ended in a yes in  1972, several central elected officials in Rogaland Labor Party  have now overcome their doubts and are saying their yes to  Norwegian membership. The majority in favor of Norwegian  membership is now very solid in this local party. It is hinted  that around 80 percent of those taking part in the annual  general meeting have ended up in the yes camp.    For those who are still in doubt and who fear for the future  if EU policy were to change and come into conflict with  Norwegian interests, the prime minister had the following  comfort:    "If we get into a situation in which we no longer feel  welcome in the EU, we can say `Thank you and good-bye.' If  there are attempts by the rest of the Union to steamroller  central national interests -- something that in principle cannot  happen under the terms of the agreement that has now been  entered into at the highest political level -- there can be no  doubt that we will reach our own conclusions. The EU is an  association of independent nations. It makes no difference what  the other countries do. It is the Norwegian Storting that in  the final analysis decides whether we enter the EU -- or leave  it."</p>

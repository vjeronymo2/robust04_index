			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RENT-HIKE PLAN ANGERS MOBILE HOME DWELLERS  </P> <P> More than 200 angry mobile home owners crowded into Moorpark City Council  chambers Wednesday night, protesting that their landlord violated a City  Council ordinance by proposing to raise their rents 25.9%.  </P> <P> Last year, the council approved an ordinance limiting rent increases at mobile  home parks to the annual increase in the national consumer price index, or 5% a  year, whichever is less.  </P> <P> "All I'm asking is that you stand firm," Cheryl Fay, a mobile home park  resident, told the council. "We have too many people on a limited income. Even  if we could stretch this time, we don't feel we could next year."  </P> <P> Residents of the Villa Del Arroyo Mobile Home Park displayed notices they  received Saturday that said their rents would jump to $350 a month beginning  Dec. 1, and that each mobile home owner would begin paying for water usage now  paid by the park owners. Rents now run from $278 to $346 a month.  </P> <P> Several months ago, the owners of the park, Villa Del Arroyo Ltd., filed a  lawsuit against the city, asking $1 million in damages on the grounds that the  ordinance had hurt them financially.  </P> <P> A decision will be made by the council on the rent increase within 75 days,  Mayor Eloise Brown said.  </P></p>

			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Shareholders back Tiphook disposal Shareholders in Tiphook, the debt-laden transport leasing group, yesterday overwhelmingly approved the sale of its container business to Transamerica, the US financial services group, for a minimum of Pounds 690m. Tiphook, which has debts of more than Pounds 1bn, had warned that its survival depended on the successful disposal of the container business, its largest asset. Completion of the sale is expected next Tuesday. But it is conditional on consents by a majority of the group's US bondholders, which must be received by Monday. Tiphook's shares closed 1p lower at 43p.</p>

They fear that due to the  introduction of a travel tax in rump Yugoslavia that is to come  into force soon, many people will try to come across to Hungary  illegally. Border Guard Spikesman Attila Krisan said that as a  result of the new decree, which is valid as of midnight, the  number of Yugoslavs entering was down to a minimum at the Tompa,  Roeszke, and Hercegszanto border crossing points.</p>

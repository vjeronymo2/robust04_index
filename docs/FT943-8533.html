			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Japanese minister kills 'part-time' job prospects This morning, about 2,500 young Japanese women will receive a letter containing the words which job-seekers everywhere know only too well: 'Thank you for your interest. We will keep your application on file'. But the letter will arrive by express delivery and will go on to explain that Japan Airlines, whose press advertisement for contract posts as flight attendants they had answered, has been prevented by the Transport Ministry from hiring them. JAL said yesterday it had grounded a plan to employ most new cabin crew on short-term contracts after Mr Shizuka Kamei, transport minister, argued last week this could endanger on-board safety. The lossmaking flag carrier was aiming - along with All Nippon Airways and Japan Air System, its domestic competitors - to pay such recruits by the hour, describing them as part-timers. Although they would normally work a full week, they would be unlikely to earn even a third of the salaries enjoyed by the career cabin staff with whom they were to share the aisles. Mr Kamei implied that such disparities would create two classes of employee who might not work together in sufficient harmony to be able to deal with an in-flight emergency. The Japanese airline industry, where training is rigorous and the safety record good, was indignant. But faced with a threat by Mr Kamei to deny applications for new routes if carriers persisted in the plan, JAL relented yesterday and the others are expected to follow suit. JAL, anxious to cut costs, insists the scheme has merely been put in a holding pattern while it addresses the ministry's concerns. For Mr Kamei, who comes from the Liberal Democratic party, these worries may extend beyond safety to the effect the move would have in further eroding the system of lifetime employment - regarded by his party as a foundation of Japanese economic success under its 37-year conservative rule. After a year out of office, the LDP is back as the dominant force in a three-party coalition headed by Mr Tomiichi Murayama. The prime minister's Social Democratic party draws much of its support from public sector unions which are also keen to retain employment protection. JAL, privatised in the 1980s, intended to employ an initial 100 stewardesses on contract terms. Not only would they be paid much less, but if business got any worse the airline could shed them, unlike its 6,000 salaried cabin crew. Over the next four years the company is trying to reduce that number to 4,600 but cannot force any to go. The 100 women would have been hired through a charter subsidiary in order to avoid direct wage comparisons, and would have been restricted, at first anyway, to domestic routes. The fact that there were 25 applicants for every post indicates the high level of female unemployment in Japan as the country reaches the end of its longest post-war recession. Women graduates complain that they are again at the back of the queue for most jobs, after a period of labour shortage made more companies hire on merit. Most work on offer for them is part-time. And at JAL now, not even that. At a televised news conference yesterday a company executive, announcing that the plan had been suspended, could only say: 'We are sorry if we have brought hardship to the people who applied.'</p>

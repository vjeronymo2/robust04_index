			<p><P> September 4, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COST OF U.S. INTERVENTION IN THE MIDEAST  </P> <P> Young Americans are being sent off to die for gas guzzlers. Essentially  television is whooping it up for flag and glory while Texas oilmen and Arab  sheiks pipe the tune.  </P> <P> Magazines and newspapers, however, are giving a more responsible and sober  assessment of the costs of war in the Middle East. Persian Gulf military  operations are now costing American taxpayers $1 million an hour and could go  as high as $1 billion a day if war erupts.  </P> <P> Can you imagine what miracles could be performed if these millions (or  billions) were spent on energy efficiency instead of an oil war? No American  hostages, no gas gouging at the pump, no clogged freeways, no smog-shrouded  cities, cleaner air and fewer deaths from cancer. It would also mean  preservation of America's coastal treasures from offshore oil drilling.  </P> <P> Instead, as Americans sink deeper into debt and smog because of oil blackmail,  they see Texas oilman George Bush doing nothing to promote energy efficiency as  he himself roars along the coast of Maine in a powerboat that reportedly burns  up to 25 gallons of gasoline an hour. Moreover, he resists efforts by Congress  to pass an automobile fuel-efficiency bill.  </P> <P> We Americans should fire a shout loud enough to be heard around the world --  "Off oil!"  </P> <P> D.M. HEDLEY  </P> <P> Midway City  </P></p>

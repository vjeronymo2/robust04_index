			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Pru completes Pounds 160m deals Prudential, the insurance company, is expected to complete two property deals worth more than Pounds 160m within the next 10 days, writes Bethan Hutton. One deal, worth an estimated Pounds 90m, is for Wimpey's 50 per cent stake in Little Britain, a central London office development. The other is for a half-share in the Cwmbran shopping centre in south Wales, for which it will pay Ladbroke Group about Pounds 75m. Prudential indicated earlier this year that it had up to Pounds 1bn to invest in commercial property during 1994. The completion of these two purchases will mean it has spent almost half that amount.</p>

			<p><P> March 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Regulators Seize Arizona S&amp;L: Federal regulators seized Pima Savings &amp;  Loan Assn., Tucson, Ariz., leaving only four thrifts operating independently in  the economically troubled state. Pima was taken over by the Resolution Trust  Corp., an agency created last August to sell or close insolvent thrift  institutions. The Treasury's Office of Thrift Supervision rejected as  unrealistic Pima's plan to raise capital to meet the more stringent  requirements of last year's S&amp;L law.  </P></p>

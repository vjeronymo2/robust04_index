			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Survey shows 8.5% rise in directors' pay Directors' pay rose by an average 8.5 per cent this year, more than six percentage points above inflation, according to a survey published yesterday. Chief executives, directors and senior executives earn an average basic salary of Pounds 109,030, increasing to Pounds 183,787 when bonuses and other benefits are included. In a telephone survey of the FT-SE 100 companies, more than half said their chief executives worked under three-year contracts, which can command huge severance payments. Almost two thirds of those companies stated they had no intention to reduce the length of contracts, despite a high profile campaign by leading investment institutions. Chief executives, whose average total pay package now stands at Pounds 351,280, have resisted institutional pressure to move away from three-year rolling contracts. The survey, by actuaries Bacon &amp; Woodrow, of 954 directors in 126 companies, also revealed a widening pay gap between small and large businesses. Directors at companies with turnover of more than Pounds 1.25bn enjoyed a 10 per cent pay rise, compared with 6 per cent for those at companies with less than Pounds 125m turnover. 'Our survey data shows that directors' earnings differentials are widening between the successful and the struggling companies, as performance-related pay becomes a larger part of the remuneration mix,' said Mr Keith McNeish, pay and benefits consultant at Bacon &amp; Woodrow. 'Furthermore, the pay gap is widening between small and large companies. The salary gap between executives has also increased over the past 12 months, with the differential between chief executives and their senior executives rising from 136 to 170 per cent. The survey revealed that the UK's average director is aged 48 and male. Of the 954 executives surveyed, just 32 are female. Directors' TRP survey 1994. Bacon &amp; Woodrow.

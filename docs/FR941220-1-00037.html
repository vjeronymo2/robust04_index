			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Monitoring requirements to ensure that the bottled water meets the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sulfate MCL and other MCLs are explained in the section below on Compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Monitoring Requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> PWSs would need to maintain a record of public requests for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bottled water, either by a telephone log or other means, by which the date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the request and the date of delivery are recorded and maintained for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State verification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the public notification is done effectively, it is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> anticipated that emergency delivery of bottled water will be necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Customers should have the time to notify the PWS well in advance of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> desired delivery date. In the event that a customer has not had access to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the public notification and is unable to procure bottled water prior to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> normal delivery by the PWS, the PWS should have the ability to provide an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emergency delivery within 24 hours of receiving the request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Public Education/Notification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public education and public notification are important in making  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> people aware of the potential adverse health effects of high levels of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sulfate and educating them about how to protect themselves if they are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within the targeted population. For CWSs, there are four components to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed public education and public notification requirement: Notices in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bills, pamphlets, signs and notices to the media. In communities where a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant portion of the population speaks a language other than English,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the text would need to be in the appropriate language(s), in addition to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> English.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Notices in Bills. PWSs would be required to use their bill  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notices to inform residents of the sulfate content in their water and its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential impact on non-acclimated persons. The compliance requirements for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mail delivery would be the same as those for the general public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notification mail delivery requirements in &sect;141.32(a) (2) and (3), except  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the interval for sulfate notification is proposed to be every six  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> months rather than three months. EPA is proposing to specify a six-month  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interval to assure that a pregnant woman would receive at least one notice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during the term of her pregnancy. The notice would have to be typed in bold  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lettering on the bill itself. There would also need to be an additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> page with more information on the potential health effect from ingesting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> high levels of sulfate in drinking water. That page would include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information about how expectant mothers and residents can request and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receive bottled water for infants and guests, how to mix tap water with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bottled water over time to gradually acclimate the person to sulfate, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> well as a section reassuring the consumer that there are no ill effects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from high sulfate-containing water for residents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The PWS would also need to provide the same notice to new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> customers or billing units prior to or at the time service begins.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pamphlets. PWSs would be required to provide pamphlets to all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> medical facilities, which includes, but is not limited to city, county and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State health departments, pharmacies, public and private hospitals and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clinics, family planning clinics and local welfare agencies. The PWS would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> need to request that the operators of those facilities make the pamphlets  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available to pregnant women. The pamphlets would contain the information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> listed above for notices in bills.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Signs. PWSs would be required to post permanent, prominent and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> visible signs in all public areas where not all taps will have treated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Notices to the Media. PWSs would be required to submit copies of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the notice described above to radio and television stations that broadcast  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the community served by the water system when sulfate in excess of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MCL has been detected in the water, and once every six months while the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water delivered into the distribution system exceeds the sulfate MCL. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> geographical service area in question would have to be indicated and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clearly defined in the notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Transient Systems and Non-Transient, Non-Community Systems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Bottled Water and POU/POE Devices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Transient systems, which comprise most of the affected systems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1,200 of 1,950), and non-transient, non-community systems would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to make either bottled water which complies with EPA MCLs or water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treated with a POU/POE device available for travelers at establishments in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the service area. Where the target population is affected on a relatively  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continual basis, PWSs may find it more cost-effective to provide POU or POE  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> devices. Where the system rarely serves members of the target population,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it might choose to have a supply of bottled water on hand. Non-transient,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> non-community water systems, such as schools, factories and hospitals,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> might choose to install POEs in their cafeterias. PWSs would be responsible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for maintaining POU/POE devices to ensure their continuing effectiveness.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Public Education/Notification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public notification for transient systems and non-transient, non- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> community systems would be posting of signs. Such systems have no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> customers to ``bill'', and notices to the media and pamphlets would not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective or necessary. PWSs would be required to post permanent,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prominent and visible signs, made of durable material such as plastic, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> places such as rest areas, campgrounds, gas stations and public areas. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> signs would target travelers and newcomers, and would alert the public to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the health effects of sulfate and the nearest location of drinking water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for individuals not acclimated to high sulfate levels. The signs would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have to be placed in any location where all taps (i.e., faucets, fountains,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or other source of water that could be used for drinking) are not providing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water in compliance with the sulfate MCL. If the location has a POE  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> device, posting would not be necessary, since all taps would provide water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that complies with the MCL. In the case of campgrounds, sources such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hand pumps or trailer hook-ups would be posted with signs, and bottled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water could be available at the entrance gate or registration area. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency recognizes that there are unmanned, remote campgrounds in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> national parks system, and requests comment on the means of compliance for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Rationale  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The sanctioning of Alternative Water as a means of compliance is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an innovative approach that EPA has developed in recognition of the special  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circumstances and concerns surrounding the sulfate regulation. The proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> option would provide Alternative Water to sensitive populations only for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the period of time needed for acclimation. The Alternative Water approach  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is appropriate in this case because the target populations are readily  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identifiable and because their need is short-term. Option 1 provides PWSs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flexibility and seeks to alleviate the financial burden that central  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment might entail for small PWSs, and as such is in accordance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the objectives of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes that the requirements of Option 1 for PWSs to provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bottled water which complies with EPA MCLs or POU/POE devices and to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide public notice and education, taken together, will assure a supply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of drinking water to the Target Population which dependably complies with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the MCL for sulfate (see SDWA Section 1401(1)(D).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

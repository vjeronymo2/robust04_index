			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Paris and Bonn get set to do business MR Alain Juppe, the new French foreign minister, has announced plans to travel to Bonn on Monday for a meeting with Mr Klaus Kinkel, his German counterpart. The news of the foreign ministers' meeting followed the announcement that Mr Edouard Balladur, the new prime minister, would meet Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, in Bonn on April 22. Mr Balladur is anxious for his administration to forge close links with the Germans on monetary issues. He also hopes to secure Germany's support on strategic matters, notably France's objections to the European Community's agricultural reforms and the present EC stance on farming in the Gatt negotiations. Meanwhile, Mr Juppe will meet Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary in Paris today. The meeting follows stiff protests from the UK government about last Sunday's clash between French fishermen and a Royal Navy patrol boat off the Channel Islands.</p>

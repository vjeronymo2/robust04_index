			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW SOUTH GATE COUNCIL SCRAPS FRESH JOB POLICIES  </P> <P> Two veteran councilmen and three newly elected members moved quickly Monday to  undo some decisions of the departed City Council majority.  </P> <P> The council, which last week held its first full meeting since the April 10  election, scrapped a plan -- approved on the eve of the election -- to give top  appointive officials, including the city administrator and city attorney, more  job protection and an improved severance package.  </P> <P> City Atty. Bruce Boogaard, in particular, had increasingly been criticized by  some council members, with some candidates suggesting during the campaign that  administrators would be fired if the balance of power changed on the  five-member council.  </P> <P> The balance did change when voters elected three newcomers. One incumbent,  Mayor Herbert W. Cranton, was defeated. Two other incumbents did not seek  reelection.  </P> <P> Council members voted to remove two advisory measures from the June 5 election  ballot and hired a special attorney -- at $150 an hour -- to provide advice on  the legality of such an effort and other legal matters.  </P> <P> The new council majority was more comfortable calling on another attorney for  advice on some matters and wanted to avoid creating a possible conflict of  interest for the city attorney, Mayor Robert A. Philipp said.  </P> <P> Councilman Larry Leonard said Boogaard played a major role in writing the  ballot measures and the job-security resolution, and so stood to benefit from  the resolution.  </P> <P> Leonard emphasized, however, that no administrator has been fired. "We haven't  terminated anybody," he said. "The city attorney has not been relieved of any  of his duties."  </P> <P> The council hired attorney William Rudell as a special legal counsel at $150 an  hour but limited the total contract to $25,000.  </P> <P> Council veterans Philipp and Gregory Slaughter joined new council members  Johnny Ramirez, Mary Ann Buckles and Leonard in the voting to rescind the  job-protection measure and to try to remove the ballot measures.  </P> <P> Philipp and Slaughter voted for the election-eve resolution. Philipp said he  reversed his position after examining the former council's action more  carefully.  </P> <P> "It's a bad measure," he said. "This should be part of negotiations."  </P> <P> Under the resolution, administrators could have been fired only for  work-related causes or for committing a felony. Administrators would have been  given 60 days' notice of termination, plus paid leaves of up to six months to  search for another job.  </P> <P> Then-council members Cranton, Odell L. Snavely and William H. DeWitt also voted  for the resolution. Snavely and DeWitt did not seek reelection.  </P> <P> Former Mayor Cranton criticized the council's decision to hire a special  attorney: "It is stupid for them to hire a legal counsel for that price when we  already have a city attorney." The former mayor said Philipp has a "personal  vendetta" against the city attorney and other top administrators.  </P> <P> Philipp declined to discuss the issue, saying it is a "personnel matter." And  neither Boogaard nor city administrator Bruce Spragg would comment.  </P> <P> In an earlier interview, Boogaard said he thought his job was secure.  </P> <P> Philipp and Slaughter had split with the old council majority over the issue of  placing two advisory measures on the June ballot.  </P> <P> One measure asks voters whether they would approve of developing 7.14 acres of  vacant city land into an auto sales lot. The other measure asks voters whether  they would favor providing loans to local metal-fabricating companies.  </P> <P> The former council majority approved the ballot measures, even though both  issues were moot.  </P> <P> Automobile dealer Pete Ellis had withdrawn plans to develop an auto sales lot  on the vacant land after residents of a nearby mobile home park protested.  Shultz Steel officials had sought a $2-million loan from the city to pay for  plant construction but withdrew the request.  </P> <P> New council member Buckles, in voting to remove the ballot measures, said:  "Pete Ellis pulled out of the deal. Why put something on the ballot that no one  wants any more?"  </P> <P> The special attorney has been asked to determine whether it is too late for the  measures to be removed from the ballot by the county registrar of voters.  </P></p>

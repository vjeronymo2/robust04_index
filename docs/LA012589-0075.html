			<p><P> January 25, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CREDIT;  </P> <P> BOND PRICE RISE TIED TO DOLLAR'S STRONG RALLY  </P> <P> Long-term government bond prices rose strongly Tuesday, buoyed by a dollar  rally inspired by Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan's comments  about the central bank's inflation-fighting strategy.  </P> <P> Other government issues posted moderate gains.  </P> <P> The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 3/4 point, or $7.50 for every $1,000  in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price,  fell to 8.78% from 8.85% late Monday.  </P> <P> Analysts attributed the credit market's performance to the way the dollar  behaved after Greenspan expressed the central bank's determination to fight  inflation.  </P> <P> Testifying before the House Banking Committee, Greenspan said strains on  factory capacity and a tight labor market, particularly in the Northeast,  likely would keep inflation pressures high. The central bank's monetary policy  therefore should continue on the tight side, he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sale of Two-Year Notes  </P> <P> The notion that a tighter monetary policy could drive interest rates higher,  increasing returns on dollar-denominated investments relative to holdings in  other currencies, propped up the dollar.  </P> <P> For bond traders, this implied that demand will be brisk at sales of government  notes and bonds. The Treasury is scheduled to sell about $9.25 billion of  two-year notes on Wednesday.  </P> <P> In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term government  issues rose by between 1/16 point and 1/8 point, intermediate maturities rose  by 5/16 point, and long-term issues were up about 3/4 point, according to  Telerate Inc., a financial information service.  </P> <P> The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond  with a $1,000 face value.  </P> <P> The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price  movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or  longer, went up 2.84 to 1,141.95.  </P> <P> In corporate bond trading, industrials were up. Moody's investment grade  corporate bond index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with  maturities of five years or longer, rose 1.51 to 299.87.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 3-Month Yields Decline  </P> <P> In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal  bonds rose 5/32 point to 92 17/32. The average yield to maturity declined to  7.64% from 7.66% late Monday.  </P> <P> Yields on three-month Treasury bills declined to 8.50 as the discount fell to  8.22%. Yields on six-month bills held steady at 8.72% and the discount remained  at 8.26%. Yields on one-year bills declined to 8.88% as the discount fell to  8.23%.  </P> <P> A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the  annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The discount is the  percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at  maturity.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was  quoted at 9 1/16%, up from 9% late Monday.  </P></p>

			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Clyde Blowers rights to fund acquisition Clyde Blowers, the specialist engineer, is calling for Pounds 3.6m partly to finance the acquisition of Boiler Products Engineering, based near Brussels, Belgium, from Stein Industrie (France), a wholly owned subsidiary of GEC Alsthom. The total consideration, including payment of debt to its parent company, is about Pounds 3m cash. BPE designs, distributes and services boiler cleaning equipment. It made pre-tax profits of BFr15.8m (Pounds 306,000) on turnover of BFr229m in the 12 months to March 31 1993. At that date it had net assets of BFr57.9m. The rights issue of 800,000 new ordinary shares is on the basis of 4-for-5 at 500p each. Yesterday the shares closed 37p down at 633p. The issue is fully underwritten by Allied Provincial Securities. In addition to funding the acquisition, proceeds from the rights will be used to reduce short-term borrowings and to provide future working capital. Clyde Blowers also forecast profits of not less than Pounds 182,000 pre-tax for the year to August 31 and a final dividend of 8p.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Norwegian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Aslak Bonde report: "Finnish EU Doubts About Norway"] </F>   [Text] There is growing distrust between Norway and  Finland over the agricultural issues in the EU [European Union]  negotiations.    Who is letting down whom? This question is being asked  increasingly often at present, a week and a half before the  planned completion of the EU negotiations. Rumors are rife, and  many are to do with the Finns' and the Norwegians' real motives  and demands with regard to agriculture.    In Finnish negotiating circles the view is that Norway is  not  battling particularly hard to achieve success on the most  important issue: What sort of permanent support arrangements  will be agreed for northern agriculture? There is also a  feeling that Norway has begun too early to talk about  compromises when it comes to transitional arrangements.    The Norwegians have long been afraid that the Finns will  forget their demand for reasonable transitional arrangements if  they only succeed in achieving good permanent support  arrangements. It is being said that as the result of a Finnish  initiative the European Commission is now working to find  alternatives to transitional arrangements for the food industry.  These include investment support, debt rescheduling, and  regional support.    AFTENPOSTEN has been unable to confirm the truth of any of  these rumors, but they are nevertheless interesting because they  show the fragility of Nordic cohesion.    There are also a number of obvious reasons for why the  rumors  have arisen. At last week's negotiating meeting the Norwegian  trade minister opted for a strategy different from that of her  colleagues from the three other applicant countries. She  pointed to the fact that on the question of transitional  arrangements for agriculture the EU has kept the door ajar for  Norway.    However, since then only very few have seen the gap in the  door that Grete Knudsen saw. Most people think that the EU  stood completely firm on its original demand that EU prices  should be introduced on the day that Norway becomes a member.    Outsiders took the Norwegian attitude to be that Norway  accepts the introduction of EU prices from day one if it is  possible to make exceptions for those farmers and that section  of the food industry that simply cannot cope with such a rapid  transition to the EU market.    According to AFTENPOSTEN's information, this is to read too  much into things. It is true that Norway has agreed to  investigate the need for transitional arrangements for every  individual product in the agricultural sector, but this  investigation will show that we need protection in the vast  majority of cases. Thus Norway is standing firm on the central  principle -- of achieving a type of transitional arrangement  different from those the EU has proposed.    As far as permanent support arrangements are concerned,  there  is an obvious reason why Finland is suspicious of Norway's  determination to stand firm: At present the EU is working with  an arrangement that suits Norway much better than it suits  Finland. A proposal for criteria that will determine new  support arrangements has been drafted which, in crude terms,  will mean that northern Norway, Trondelag, and the northernmost  part of southern Norway can receive special support. The same  criteria only provide a base for support for 3 percent of  Finnish agriculture.    The Finns therefore have major problems with accepting these  criteria as a point of departure for the negotiations. In  Norway the attitude is that with a few minor adjustments to the  EU's criteria it will also be possible to cover important areas  of southern Norway.    Norwegian negotiators are therefore attaching importance to  the fact that the EU is now actually prepared to create support  arrangements that are specially designed for the farmers in the  north. This was not the case from the beginning.</p>

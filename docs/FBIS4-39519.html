			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] St. Petersburg June 8 TASS -- Vladimir Shumeyko,  chairman of the council of the CIS interparliamentary assembly,  and Admiral Aleksandr Mochaikin, representative from the  headquarters for coordinating CIS military cooperation,  recommended the participants of the session of the  interparliamentary assembly's council, currently under way in  St. Petersburg, to set up CIS peace- keeping forces.    Interviewed by ITAR-TASS, the admiral stressed the urgent  need to set up such units. There are only Russian disengagement  forces were on the territory of the CIS at present, but their  status does not correspond to the U.N. mandate on peace-keeping  forces. According to Mochaikin's forecast, not all the CIS  nations will be ready to assign their troops for peacekeeping  missions, but their contribution, he believes, could be  financial or in the form of equipment deliveries.    In case today's appeal to the MPs to set up CIS  peace-keeping  forces is met, the question will have to be discussed at the  level of the CIS council of defence ministers and council of  foreign ministers so that corresponding proposals could be  submitted to the next plenary meeting of the interparliamentary  assembly.</p>

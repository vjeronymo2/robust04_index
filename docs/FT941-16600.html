			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Gardening: Up the hill slowly For two years, I have been engaged in an assault on a listed garden monument. Such assaults provoke others to assault them, but my news for the new year is mercifully simple. The assault is in place: immovably so, as it has involved about 200 megaliths of York stone. I therefore declare 1994 the Year of the Mound, having changed the face of the biggest surviving mound in Britain which has dominated my Oxford college's gardens for 350 years. Mounds, or mounts, became popular as gardening emerged from the middle ages. They were hillocks, built artificially, off which gardeners could survey their handiwork or risk a glimpse of wild nature beyond the garden wall. When New College in Oxford decided to build a mound, wild nature over its city wall amounted to the deer park and woolly fellows of Magdalen College. When complete, its mound also looked down on four famous knot gardens, embroidered with coats of arms, a floral clock and the college's motto, Manners Makyth Man. Some believe the mound began in 1529 when 500 loads of rubbish were dumped in the gardens. Certainly, it had been started by the 1590s when 'ye gardener' was being paid a shilling for piling earth 'towards the making of the mount'. The piling and barrowing continued for 60 years. In 1648-49, historians focus on the civil war, but New College had an event of its own: its mound was complete, with steps at intervals up to its summit and a hedge round its girth. Since then, the knot gardens have given way to a lawn and wild nature beyond the wall has become our barbarous building. The steps have fallen away; the fellows' learned sundial has disappeared; trees have sprouted at random, especially some horrible sycamores; and the view has been dominated by two fine holm oaks, one of which dates back to the 19th century. In 1991, the prospect changed. Kenneth Rose, a journalist and historian, donated a sum to his old college for the mound's improvement. Everybody agreed that the undergrowth needed to be cleared, except for the London Evening Standard which lamented the plan, alleging that it traditionally offered covert to the sexual affairs of undergraduates. To widen access, I pictured a tapering staircase in stone, opening the mound in a bold, full-frontal ascent. But as a listed monument, a mound needs planning permission - and this has to satisfy building regulations and protesting parties. Many more parties are interested now than in 1648. A pressure group for rural spaces said the idea was intrusive in a rural setting, although the garden is in the middle of Oxford; heritage groups claimed that the weeds and decay on the mound were part of your and my heritage; and the Garden History Society opposed the proposal on the ground that it did not qualify as a restoration because it was not restoring the original steps. The city council began to waver. Could I not scale down the ambition and build a partial staircase, only a third of the way to the top of the hill? Refusing to climb down, we put the full-frontal to the councillors who debated it, voted - and let it through. After a year's 'consultation', we were free to do what we wanted. The scheme nearly foundered on the standard advice of gardening handbooks. In their diagrams, steps have separate risers and separate slabs as treads. We mapped out experimental risers and dropped flat slabs on to them like mini-bricks, but the result looked ever more awful because of the scale of the whole. I was saved by John Robins, who practises architecture in north London. He saw that we should ignore the garden books and make the steps from single blocks. In such a bold setting, blocks have the quality which conventional treads lack. Blocks also require muscle and the talent of stone masons. We commissioned a local team which carted and hoisted tons of gravel and the blocks for 50 broad, tapering steps. If I encourage you to anything similar, be sure to use a trained architect: about Pounds 18,000 sufficed for the stone and labour of our staircase, which now rises like the steps up a massive ancient ziggurat, beautifying a mound which had lost its point through too many years of conservation. The city council did make one condition. It insisted that an archaeological survey should precede this new folly. The Oxford Archaeological Unit, under Chris Bell found nothing to cause further bother, apart from some mugs, clay pipes, oyster shells and one puzzle: a quantity of small bones, remains of an unidentified animal. These bones have now been identified, not from carbon dating but from the London cocktail circuit. In the early 1980s two female undergraduates kept a lamb in college. It lived in their bathroom; they named it Ruffly. Their cleaner fed it a toffee bar, whereupon it choked and died while its keepers were attending a lecture. They gave it its last rites on the college mound and buried it darkly at dead of night, turning the sods with their mortarboards. Five days' archaeology on the orders of the council exhumed poor Ruffly, kept in breach of college regulations. On a high hill (as the poet, John Donne, puts it), rugged and steep, Truth stands. Nothing stands above our staircase except a proposal for an inauguration on Ascension Day, on which atheists can merely see the stairs' ascent and others can impose a Christian interpretation. To the beat of drums, under-achieving pupils and tutors can be led up for execution by the academic auditors, sent recently by the Department of Education to measure our added value. Perhaps visitors will call for a statue on our high hill. Some may think that Ruffly deserves a memorial, patron of our academic flock. In the deconstructed climate of today's intellectuals, I would prefer to leave a void and signify Truth by a leap into nothingness on the top.</p>

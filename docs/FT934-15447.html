			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Taxman tightens grip Ten months into the European single market, many companies are still struggling to comply with the complexities of the new value added tax (VAT) regime. UK Customs &amp; Excise, for one, has given businesses a breathing space to get used to the new system but will start to tighten up in 1994. What should companies be doing to ensure that when this happens they are not caught out? VAT specialists suggest: Check the accuracy of the sales and trade data you are filing to customs. You will not want to go back over several months of figures if the VATman challenges your numbers. Check that you are only making VAT-free exports to VAT-registered customers. If you discover later that a customer is not VAT-registered you will be required to pay VAT on those sales. Confirm that you have appointed a VAT representative where appropriate in countries where you make substantial sales to customers not registered for VAT or you could incur local penalties and a VAT liability. The threshold levels vary. 'The fixed penalties pale into insignificance compared with the cost of having to pay VAT of 17.5 per cent on sales when you did not expect it,' comments John Arnold, tax partner at accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand. But VAT is not the only area where businesses should review matters. Companies may be failing to exploit the operational benefits of the single market. Businesses should consider whether they cannot reduce their stock levels to take account of faster delivery times in the new barrier-free market. They should review their transport costs to see if their shippers have passed on all or any of the benefits of the faster delivery times. They should reduce the size of what are known as deferment guarantees provided by their banks now there is no longer a need to cover a VAT liability on EC imports.</p>

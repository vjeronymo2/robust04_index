			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast: Video report by S. Sokolova, </F> identified by caption]    [Excerpt] The eternal flame at the obelisk in Plesetsk is  a reminder of two terrible tragedies which took place at the  missile and space flight test range. In June 1973 nine people  died while testing rocket technology. And in March 1980, during  preparations for a space launch, a powerful explosion of the  already fueled space "submarine" [submarina] occured as a result  of technical faults. Forty-eight young people died at their  stations. According to eye-witness accounts many of them were  engulfed by fire and burned alive instantaneously. Others,  finding themselves in a hopeless situation, jumped from a great  height, smashing on the concrete only to be also engulfed by the  raging flames. [passage omitted]</p>

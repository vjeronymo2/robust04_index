			<p>BFN     [Text] TALLINN, May 25, BNS - The traces of persons having  illegally brought Kurdish emigrants to Estonia lead to Russia  and investigators in Tallinn are now expecting "active  attendance" to the issue from the respective Russian bodies,  said the head of the Estonian Border Guard Department, Tarmo  Kouts.    Estonian border officials and the police "K" special task  force in a joint operation on May 5 arrested five persons  suspected of being engaged in organizing the illegal transits.  One of the persons detained was already being sought by Swedish  police on the same charges.    The head of the Estonian Border Guard Command, Aare Evisalu,  earlier said Estonia has caught four larger groups of a total  some 200 Kurdish immigrants having arrived in the country  illegally this year.    Investigation is being conducted into all four cases of  illegal transit attempts, he said in an interview.    The government on March 15 set up an investigation party of  border guard, Police Department, Central Criminal Police and  Defense Police officials.    Evisalu said that information received at questioning of the  Kurds had created a possibility to find the persons organizing  the transit. "On the basis of that information we can bring  these persons to charges and close the transit route for taking  the Kurds to the West through Estonia," Evisalu said.    Evisalu in the interview a week ago said that investigation  into who had organized bringing of the Kurds to Estonia was  expected to be finished within a few weeks' time.</p>

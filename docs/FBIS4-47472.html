Shananin, Moscow Institute  of Engineering Physics; UDC 621.373.826.038.825.3]    [Abstract] The performance of a two-frequency YAG:Nd+++  laser with beat (frequency separation) modulation for  communication systems and rangefinders is analyzed  theoretically, assuming equal quality factors in both modes and  a uniformly broadened amplification band when the gain excess  over the the sum of cavity and exit mirror losses remains small.  For specificity is considered a laser with the following  parameters: half-width of upper level _g_= 3 kHz, unilateral  half-width of amplification band &Ggr;= 200 GHz, normalized  pumping rate _ee_= 1.0225, absolute frequency deviation D= 1  GHz.  The system of equations of kinetics has been solved numerically  for the population inversion in each mode, the intensity of each  mode, and the beat frequency as explicit functions of time in  the case of linear sawtooth frequency modulation of one mode.  With the aid of these data is now calculated the form of a  compressed pulse and thus also its nonlinearity, whereupon the  results are used for the design of a matching filter or  correlational signal processor. The resolving power of a  rangefinder operating with one such two-frequency laser is found  to be theoretically the same as that of a rangefinder operating  with two single-frequency lasers. Practically, however, it is  much higher owing to the fact that here technical fluctuations  are correlated and especially so at a 10[.sup]6[/] GHz/s or  higher scanning rate with a pulse signal shortened to an  approximately 5 ns duration.

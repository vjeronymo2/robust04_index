			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA proposes to approve the emission statement program SIP submittals of Connecticut, Maine, Rhode Island and Vermont and invites public comment on the action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Components of the Emission Statement Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There are several key general and specific components of an acceptable emission statement program. Specifically, the State must submit a revision to its SIP and the emission statement program must meet the minimum requirements for reporting by the sources and the State. In general, the program must include, at a minimum, provisions for applicability, definitions, compliance, and specific source requirements detailed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. SIP Revision Submission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA requires States to submit their SIP revision within 2 years of enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) (November 15, 1990).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Connecticut and Rhode Island submitted their SIP revisions on January 12, 1993. Maine and Vermont were each notified in a letter dated January 15, 1993 that a finding of failure to submit a SIP for Emission Statements was made. Vermont submitted its SIP revision on August 9, 1993, and Maine submitted its SIP revision on January 3, 1994. EPA reviewed these two submittals and, as outlined above, found them complete. Therefore, the sanctions clock was stopped for this plan element for each of these states. However, the January 15, 1993 finding also triggered the Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) clock. EPA remains obligated to promulgate a FIP until a final rulemaking action to approve these two SIP revisions is taken.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Reporting Requirements for State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to the program elements applying to sources, the SIP should include a provision that States provide to EPA the identifying information for the sources covered by the emission statement program, the value for rule effectiveness utilized by the State in its SIP calculations, the source data elements entered into AIRS, and quarterly emission statement status reports. The minimum source identification information should include the AIRS code, the AFS point number (ID), the AFS segment number (ID), and the Source Category Code (SCC) and descriptions for each segment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, States should supply to EPA the current rule effectiveness (RE) factors at the SCC pollutant level, if applicable, and the RE method codes. The emission statement data submittal to AIRS should include all data obtained from the source and the State. These source-supplied data elements include source identification information (name, physical location, mailing address of the facility, latitude and longitude, and 4-digit Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code(s)), operating schedule information (percentage annual throughput, days per week on the normal operating schedule, hours per day during the normal operating schedule, and hours per year on the normal operating schedule), process rate data (annual process rate (annual throughput) and peak ozone season daily process rate), control equipment information (current primary and secondary control equipment identification codes and current combined control equipment efficiency (%)), and emissions information (estimated actual VOC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions at the segment level (in tons per year for an annual emission rate and pounds per day for a typical ozone season day), estimated emissions method code, calendar year for the emissions, and emission factor (if used)). EPA recommends that the States electronically submit emission statement data into the AIRS database no later than July 1 of each year, commencing in 1993. The quarterly reports should show the total number of facilities that met the State's emission statements program requirements and the number of facilities that failed to meet the requirements. Quarterly reports should be submitted commencing no later than July 1, 1993. Connecticut commits to submitting data along with supplemental data to EPA by July 1. All the EPA required data elements will be covered. EPA will negotiate with Connecticut to include a requirement for quarterly emission statement reports in future 105 grants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Maine covers all the EPA required data elements. Maine has not committed to a data submittal date to EPA. Maine will not meet the present July 1 deadline of submitting data to EPA. Maine will, however, have plenty of time to meet the deadline of November 15 being proposed by the Emission Statement Workgroup. EPA will negotiate with Maine to include a requirement for quarterly emission statement reports in future 105 grants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rhode Island's rule has covered all the EPA required data elements. Rhode Island has not committed to submitting emission statement data to EPA by July 1. EPA will negotiate with Rhode Island to include a requirement for quarterly emission statement reports in future 105 grants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Vermont has committed to report all the necessary data elements to EPA by July 1 of each calendar year. Vermont states in its SIP narrative that for any emissions estimates which depend on rule enforcement for control of potential emissions, rule effectiveness will also be included in the submittal to EPA. EPA will negotiate with Vermont to include a requirement for quarterly emission statement reports in future 105 grants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

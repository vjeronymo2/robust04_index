Solid-phase  immunoenzyme studies showed that native Rm-III reacted with the  antibodies with and I[.sup]50[/] of 1.4 x 10E-9 M. Inhibition  studies involving the anti-Rm-III antibodies and related toxins  with diminishing homologies with Rm-III yielding showed a rise  in I[.sup]50[/] to 3.7 x 10E-6 M for the least homologous  toxin. Correlation of the immunochemical findings with amino  acid sequences showed that the epitopes of the homologous toxins  share identical structural dispositions that encompass amino  acids at positions 2, 11, 20, 28 and 46-48.

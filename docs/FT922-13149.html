			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Arts: Gulf War Paintings John Keane's exhibition does nothing if not show that war sits uneasily with the modern liberal conscience. Where once the concept of the just war might have eased it a little - or at least accommodated some of the complexities and contradictions of the lesser evil - we are today too cynical, or too naive, to do other than respond to the immediate facts of death, destruction and conspicuous waste. That such things should be brought to pass in the name of political advantage can only make them worse. The actuality of battle has become a commonplace on our television screens, the analysis and recrimination under way before the last shot is fired. It raises awkward questions: would Passchendael have been fought over as it was, with Kate Adie in the trenches and the high command in the studio to answer for gains and losses as they came in? And what is the role of the artist in all this: the objective reporter of events, or the no less objective monitor of his or her own subjective experience and response? Or the polemicist, morally committed and politically correct? The short answer is: any of these things and still the artist, but a war-artist only in the first two respects. The trouble with John Keane, on the evidence of these paintings made from the photographs he took in the month he spent with the British Army in the Gulf, is that he wants to be all three at once. He may be a very good photographer, but he is not showing his photographs. He was not, as I understand it, commissioned as a war-artist in the fashion of the second world war, a supernumerary officer living and moving with the army for the duration. Least of all was he a sometime combatant, as were so many of the artists of the first world war. Keane, by contrast, was sent by the Imperial War Museum and was evidently there on sufferance so far as the Army was concerned, and was kept well behind the lines. Even so, his experience of army life on active service was clearly authentic, and, in the period before the battle especially, he produced material that is objective enough. The best work is of this kind: a tank under camouflage netting, for example, a soldier digging a trench, two soldiers playing draughts to pass the time. But the larger portion of the work has clear polemical intent, and this makes us ask whether Keane approached his subject with an open, or at least a curious mind. Once fighting began, Keane could only experience its awful aftermath. Only once is his prejudice subverted, by the panic of a gas alert. The wry portrait of himself struggling ham-fistedly into his protective suit, is the best and most natural image of this phase. It is touching, funny in a desperate way, and it rings true. For the rest, we have the attitudinising of the cynical liberal mind, convinced the whole wasteful, colossally expensive exercise was merely to protect the oil interests of the West and of the US in particular, an exercise in neo-colonial economic oppression. How else can we gloss such titles as We are making a new world order, with its sun-bespectacled soldier amid the debris of battle and blazing oil-fields, or Mickey Mouse at the Front, with its supermarket trolley, flaccid palm tree and implicit antagonism to all things American? And there is the Death Squad, the body-bag detail with scarves wrapped tight against the stench. Above all, there is the sequence Scenes on the Road to Hell, the fleeing convoy caught and destroyed on the Basra Road. There is nothing against an overt polemic, save only that it must escape its limitations if it is to stand as art. We may think of Goya's Disasters of War, but he kept his ironical distance, well knowing who the enemy was, while making a more general and humane point. Again, we may make superficial comparison between the desolation of Paul Nash's great canvas of The Menin Road and Keane's New World Order: yet the one is distanced, impartial and thus universal in its humanity, the other merely local, personal and political. As it happens, Sargent's once notorious painting, Gassed, of a string of victims coming back from the front line, the blind leading the blind, hangs in the neighbouring gallery. It too raises the question of when polemic becomes propaganda, though avoiding the charge by its broader humanity. Also next door, as part of the current Falklands display, is some of the work of Linda Kitson, Keane's immediate predecessor in the commission, her brisk and personal reportage, drawn on the spot, a direct contrast to his more predetermined approach. Keane is an interesting and able artist, though inclined to allow his facility to run away with him. He would rather hurry and produce too much, as here, it seems, than confirm and resolve too little. His greater problem, perhaps, is philosophical: he hardly knows which side he is on.

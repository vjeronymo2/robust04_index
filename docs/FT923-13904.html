			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Rabin clinches majority Mr Yitzhak Rabin last night clinched agreements allowing him to take office next Monday at the head of an Israeli coalition government with a secure parliamentary majority, Hugh Carnegy reports from Jerusalem. With the support of Meretz, a bloc of small pro-peace parties, and Shas, an ultra-orthodox religious party, Mr Rabin's Labour party will command 62 seats in the 120-seat Knesset. Five MPs of two Arab parties, which will stay outside the coalition, will support Labour, which is committed to accelerating the Mideast peace process.</p>

			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Farming sidelines 'reap Pounds 650m' Farmers earn Pounds 650m a year from business sidelines such as bed-and-breakfast, riding, and game shoots, says a forthcoming survey by Produce Studies, the international marketing and research organisation. It says that this is nearly 6 per cent of the Pounds 11bn they receive from mainstream crop and livestock production. Mr Howard Biggs, head of surveys for Produce Studies, said: 'For many farms, even if it's only Pounds 2,000 extra a year, it makes the difference between keeping afloat and going under.' Two out of three farmers make less than Pounds 10,000 a year from diversifying, and a quarter earn less than Pounds 1,000. But 10 per cent earn more than Pounds 300m between them, some making more than Pounds 50,000 a year each. Mr Biggs said these tended to be well-heeled farmers with the land and facilities to offer sophisticated accommodation or leisure activities. The organisation surveyed 1,000 of the 114,000 farms in Britain with 20 hectares or more, which account for 94 per cent of agricultural land. It found 40 per cent have at least one source of earned income other than food production, with many farmers selling ploughing, spraying or harvesting services to others.

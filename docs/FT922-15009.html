			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / International Company News: Penser seeks redress on Nobel shareholding MR ERIK PENSER, the Swedish financier and former majority shareholder in Nobel Industries, will formally approach Sweden's centre-right government in an effort to win back his stake in the chemicals group. Mr Penser was forced to hand over his 70 per cent shareholding in Nobel, a company which he had built up over many years, to state-controlled Nordbanken late last year after the collapse of Gamlestaden, a finance company controlled by Nobel. His decision follows a recent independent report on the conduct of Swedish banks towards Nobel and Gamlestaden. The report, by Mr Jan Ramberg, a professor of law at Stockholm University, criticised Nordbanken for its conduct in the affair. In view of the report, Mr Penser said he wanted the government to show some responsibility as a key shareholder in Nordbanken - and indirectly in Nobel Industries - by helping to resolve the matter. Mr Penser said he would settle his personal debts to the banks - just over SKr3bn (Dollars 501.9m) - in exchange for his 70 per cent shareholding in Nobel. Although Mr Penser did not have the funds at his disposal, he said several leading international banks had indicated they would lend him the necessary money, providing he had the Nobel shares as collateral. If Mr Penser does regain control of Nobel, it seems likely he would try to buy the outstanding shares and take the company into private ownership. He has already started legal proceedings against Nordbanken.</p>

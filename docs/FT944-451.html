			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / Three top officials quit in Tokyo bureaucracy battle Three top Japanese civil servants, including the top bureaucrat at the powerful Ministry of International Trade and Industry, were forced to resign yesterday. The departures mark a significant victory for the government in its struggle against bureaucracy. A cabinet meeting accepted the resignations of Mr Hideaki Kumano, vice-minister at Miti and its most senior official; Mr Sozaburo Okamatsu, the Miti vice-minister for international affairs who is in charge of trade talks with the US; and Mr Kinju Atarashi, chief secretary at the Science and Technology Agency. They are the most senior casualties so far in the battle between politicians and bureaucrats and represent another blow to the declining influence of Miti, which claims credit for overseeing Japan's industrial rise after the second world war. Miti was, until recently, the only ministry able to challenge the conservative Ministry of Finance, but morale has been crippled by political infighting over the past 18 months. The upheaval is likely to delay economic deregulation, a policy promoted by Miti but viewed warily by the Ministry of Finance. Mr Atarashi resigned because of a row with Ms Makiko Tanaka, the Science and Technology Agency's politically appointed director-general, to whom he was chief adviser. He angered Ms Tanaka by warning her not to name bodies affiliated to the agency in response to a government request for state organisations to be considered for closure. His intervention was condemned, in particular, because the cuts were seen as part of the government's campaign to trim bureaucratic power. Mr Tomiichi Murayama, the prime minister, said the dismissal of Mr Atarashi, who will return to Miti, was unavoidable. By Japanese standards, the shift is a serious loss of prestige. Mr Kumano's resignation from Miti is the result of a row over the dismissal a year ago of a senior Miti bureaucrat for hastily promoting an official. This official happened to be an LDP election candidate and the party is taking its revenge against bureaucrats who opposed him. Mr Kumano is to be replaced as vice-minister by Mr Tomio Tsutsumi, head of industrial policy. Mr Okamatsu is to be replaced at international affairs by Mr Yoshihiro Sakamoto, director-general of international trade policy.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 10 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Koji  Kakizawa will visit South Korea and China on Saturday [11 June]  and Sunday to hold talks with his counterparts on North Korea's  alleged development of nuclear weapons, the Foreign Ministry  announced Friday.    Kakizawa will visit Seoul on Saturday to hold talks with  South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and meet South Korean  President Kim Yong-sam. On Sunday, he will leave Seoul for  Beijing for talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen.  Talks with the South Korean and Chinese foreign ministers are  likely to focus on the situation concerning Pyongyang's  suspected nuclear development, ministry officials said.    In Seoul, Kakizawa and Han are expected to discuss how to  deal with the situation based on the consultations last weekend  among Japan, South Korea and the United States, they said.  South Korea may brief Kakizawa on Kim's visit to Russia and  Uzbekistan and Han's visit to New York and Beijing, they said.  But Kakizawa and Han will not be discussing the specifics of  possible sanctions against Pyongyang, they said. The foreign  ministers will also discuss other international and bilateral  affairs. They will also discuss the summit meeting of the Group  of Seven (G-7) economic powers in July in Naples, Italy.    In Beijing, Kakizawa hopes to reach a common acknowledgment  with China that the current situation regarding North Korea is  very critical. Japan is likely to voice its expectations of  China's persuading Pyongyang to change its position. China has  repeatedly said it wants to solve the problem through dialogue  by taking more time and is against imposing sanctions.</p>

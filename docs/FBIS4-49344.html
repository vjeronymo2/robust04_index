			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, May 4 (XINHUA) -- The three tiers in the  political structure in Hong Kong formed on the electoral methods  passed by the present Legislative Council will all be terminated  on June 30, 1997, said a senior Chinese official here today.    The official said that due to the breakdown of the  Sino-British political talks, there will be no "through train"  for the members of the present Legislative Council in Hong Kong.    Nor will there be "through train compartment" or "partial  through train" for them, he added.    Wang Fengchao, a member of the Political Affairs Panel of  the  Preliminary Working Committee for the Preparatory Committee for  the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), made these  remarks here today after holding separate talks with two  political parties in the territory.    The so-called "through train" mainly means that members of  Hong Kong's last Legislative Council may become, upon  confirmation by the Hong Kong SAR Preparatory Committee, members  of the first Legislative Council of the Hong Kong SAR of the  People's Republic of China upon China's resumption of the  exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1, 1997. Wang  said that starting from July 1, 1997, the regional organizations  and the Legislative Council in Hong Kong shall be re- organized  in accordance with the Basic Law and the provisions of the  National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China.  He said that the fact that there will be no "through train" in  political aspect does not mean that there will be no smooth  transition in Hong Kong. "Under the situation where there is  no cooperation on the British side, we hope to cooperate with  British side in the fields concerning the economy and people's  livelihood in Hong Kong," said Wang. However, he said that  whether there will be cooperation or not in these fields mainly  depends on the attitude taken by the British side. Wang said  that the Chinese side sincerely hopes that the losses caused by  the uncooperation of the British side in the political field  could be reduced to minimum with the broad participation of Hong  Kong people so that a smooth transfer could be ensured in 1997  and the long-term prosperity and stability in Hong Kong could be  maintained.</p>

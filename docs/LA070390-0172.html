Final  </P> <P> LLOYD WEBBER SAYS MARRIAGE IS OVER  </P> <P> Composer Andrew Lloyd Webber is ending his six-year marriage to singer Sarah  Brightman.  </P> <P> Lloyd Webber, the 42-year-old composer of such hits as "Phantom of the Opera"  and "Cats," issued a statement Monday saying he had become "close friends" with  another woman, Madeleine Gurdon.  </P> <P> "It is clear to me that, with the greatest sadness, I have to face the fact  that my marriage to Sarah Brightman is at an end," he said.  </P> <P> The statement did not say whether the couple would divorce.  </P> <P> Lloyd Webber met Brightman nine years ago and cast her in "Cats." They had no  children. He has two children by a previous marriage.  </P> <P> "I am deeply saddened that our marriage should end like this," said Brightman,  30. "It is not something I . . . wish for or have sought."  </P> <P> Gurdon, a 27-year-old businesswoman, would not comment on the announcement.  </P></p>

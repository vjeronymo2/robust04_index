			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUCHANAN ON MANIFEST DESTINY  </P> <P> Buchanan has gone too far. How dare he compare the constitutional problems in  Canada with the fires of nationalism in Eastern Europe! Granted, the separatist  thrust in Quebec is serious and should not be taken lightly, but the provinces  of Canada were not enslaved and held against their will as the Eastern  Europeans were.  </P> <P> Canada was created legally, and was not forced into union by a bloody civil  war, unlike a certain well-known country. What is really inflammatory is his  taking as inevitable that Canada will self-destruct and that the U.S. will do  well in salvaging the spoils of a divided country.  </P> <P> Buchanan is at his lowest when he looks under a slippery rock and brings from  obscurity the likes of the Truman Doctrine offspring, R. Craig Schoonmaker. The  U.S.' desire for Canada's natural resources and water is no secret, but a  declining America's craving for more territory is not unlike a festering sore  reaching out to contaminate surrounding areas. Canadians will not accept this.  As a Canadian living in California, I will be one of the first to sign up as a  North American Contra.  </P> <P> TONY CUMMINGS  </P> <P> Rancho Cucamonga  </P></p>

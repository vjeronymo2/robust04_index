			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / International Company News: Saab-Scania falls 47% as car division losses mount SAAB-SCANIA, the Swedish vehicle and aerospace group, yesterday reported a 47 per cent fall in profits after financial items to SKr267m (Dollars 43m) for the first quarter of 1991, due to mounting losses at Saab Automobile. Saab-Scania, recently bought out by the investment group controlled by the Wallenberg family, predicted that annual earnings would be lower than the 1990 result of SKr2.2bn. Group sales slipped by 6 per cent to SKr6.94bn (Dollars 1.11bn), mainly because the Scania truck division suffered a 10 per cent fall in sales to SKr5.4bn. Losses at Saab Automobile, the 50:50 joint venture with General Motors, increased by 52 per cent to SKr1.011bn during the period. This reduced profits for Saab-Scania by SKr506m. Excluding Saab Automobile, profits for the rest of Saab-Scania declined 6 per cent to SKr764m. Saab Automobile reported a 16 per cent fall in volume sales to 20,800 vehicles, with demand weakening mainly in the Nordic region. Sales amounted to SKr3.36bn, a 18 per cent fall. Sales for Saab Automobile are not consolidated in Saab-Scania results. Saab-Scania and General Motors are discussing a new injection of capital into Saab Automobile. They will decide whether more funds are needed for the company's rationalisation after a review of its capital structure is completed in June. No forecast was offered for Saab Automobile's 1991 profits. The company noted that rationalisation measures taken in 1990 did not affect the first-quarter results. Scania division earnings were also lower than last year's first quarter, but were not specified. Scania's annual profits were predicted to be below last year's SKr2.9bn. Sales of trucks and buses fell by 6 per cent to 7,800 vehicles. Profits increased at the aerospace division, however, with a 17 per cent rise in sales to SKr1.18bn as orders climbed for the Saab 340 and Saab 2000 commuter aircraft. Earnings for 1991 are expected to exceed last year's SKr111m. Saab Combitech, the defence technology division, reported unchanged earnings on sales up by 38 per cent to SKr622m.</p>

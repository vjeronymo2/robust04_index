			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Citibank Investments buys assets of Randsworth Trust CITIBANK Investments, a wholly owned subsidiary of the US bank, is acquiring the assets of Randsworth Trust, a London property company, the parent of which has been in receivership for the past year. Citibank is facing a book loss of more than Pounds 100m on the deal, on which its exposure of Pounds 310m compares with assets valued at about Pounds 200m. This is the most prominent example of a bank taking control of a property company in the UK since Barclay's acquisition of Imry at the end of last year. Citibank said its decision reflected confidence in the company's prospects. Citibank's involvement in Randsworth dates back to 1989, when it backed a Pounds 258m acquisition of the company by JMB Realty, a US investment group. This deal, which was the first large investment in the UK property market by US investors, proved disastrous. As the value of Randsworth's portfolio in the West End of London halved in value, the shareholders - who injected a further Pounds 58m in 1991  - lost their equity. Even the debenture holders, who had first claim on the assets of London &amp; Provincial Shop Centres, Randsworth's chief subsidiary, lost money. Last month, Citibank agreed to repay Pounds 135m of debentures at a price of Pounds 95 for Pounds 100 of stock, in the first time in recent memory that holders of secured bonds have accepted a loss. At the same time, it said it intended to buy all or part of Randsworth. Citibank Investments has set up a company called CIPL to own Randsworth. The portfolio consists of 35 office and retail buildings in the West End, including 25 Berkeley Square, 91 Kensington High Street and St Christopher's Place, an area of shops, offices and restaurants near Oxford Street. Citibank excluded from its acquisition two small properties which have negative value. Mr Nigel Kempner, a former joint managing director, said the deal would allow the management to concentrate on enhancing the value of the business. 'Citibank is prepared to take a long term view of the property market,' he said.</p>

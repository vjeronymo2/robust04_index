			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hang Seng dives in London as New Zealand recovers INVESTORS failed to respond to Tuesday's approval of the political reform bill by a lower house parliamentary committee, and share prices moved lower in thin trading, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average lost 134.41 at 18,108.71 on arbitrage linked selling after moving between 18,030.80 and 18,344.23. Volume was 216.5m shares, against 264m. Falls led rises by 624 to 320, with 195 issues unchanged, and the Topix index of all first section stocks shed 8.52 to 1,540.82. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.18 to 1,245.01. Traders said fears of a plunge in share prices had eased to some extent: the Topix index has not fallen far below the 1,530 level, currently regarded as a technical support point. Many investors are now focusing on whether Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, will announce any economic support measures during his meeting with President Bill Clinton on Friday. However, Mr Alex Kinmont, a strategist at Morgan Stanley, warned that technical factors were still dampening sentiment, and said the Topix could fall by another 10 per cent: 'Although underlying political fundamentals may improve, shares still face pressure from arbitrage selling.' Analysts reckon that arbitrageurs still hold up to 10 per cent of outstanding shares of some stocks in arbitrage positions, which will need to be sold in order to switch from the Nikkei 225 to the new 300. Among the big blue chips, East Japan Railway closed unchanged at Y458,000, while Nippon Telegraph and Telephone fell Y10,000 to Y781,000. Profit-taking depressed bank shares, which rose on index-linked buying on Tuesday. Industrial Bank of Japan fell Y10 to Y3,280, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Y20 to Y2,260 and Sumitomo Bank Y20 to Y2,340. Large-capital issues were lower. Nippon Steel, the day's most active stock, slipped Y7 to Y327 and NKK Y2 to Y250. Daikyo closed Y70 down at Y876 on further selling following an announcement earlier this week that it would post its first pre-tax loss ever for the full year to March. Daishowa Paper dropped Y49 to Y991. The company's share price has been suffering since Mr Ryoei Saito, its ex-chairman, was arrested, allegedly for bribing politicians. Autobacs Seven, an autoparts maker, was the day's best performer, rising Y300 to Y13,400 due to the popularity of its car navigation systems. In Osaka, the OSE average dipped 154.42 to 20,290.18 in volume of 15.2m shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, weakened Y90 to Y7,170. Roundup WALL Street's overnight advances were lost on the Hong Kong market. HONG KONG took profits in its own time, the Hang Seng index falling by 176.67, or 1.8 per cent, to 9,506.98. Turnover contracted from HKDollars 9.08bn to HKDollars 8.04bn and professionals said that selling pressure was not heavy. However, London heard that Mr Barton Biggs, the Morgan Stanley strategist, had moderated his support for Hong Kong, and some said that the colony's weighting in the broker's global model portfolio had been cut by a couple of percentage points from its recent 7.2 per cent. The indicated Hang Seng fell a further 322, or 3.4 per cent, to 9,185, and there were fears of worse to come when the domestic market opens today. NEW ZEALAND recovered as the National party government gained one seat to give it 50 seats in New Zealand's 99-seat parliament. The NZSE-40 index finished 95.7, or 4.8 per cent, higher at 2,074.4. Mr John Rattray at Ord Minnett said demand came from both foreign and domestic clients. Turnover was high at NZDollars 90m, but not excessive. Among market leaders, Telecom, which represents 23 per cent of the index, closed 24 cents stronger at NZDollars 4.17 in good volume; and Brierley, which dropped plans for a controversial executive share scheme at its annual meeting on Tuesday, firmed 3 cents to NZDollars 1.19. AUSTRALIA bid strongly for banks as the All Ordinaries index moved forward 20.5 to 2,104.3. The market reassessed Tuesday's profits from ANZ and, although net earnings of ADollars 246.5m were at the lower end of expectations, the shares eventually closed 29 cents, or 6.5 per cent, up at a year's high of ADollars 4.73. SINGAPORE ended off the day's highs, but with the Straits Times Industrial index still 18.50 better at 2,096.51. SEOUL saw individual investors pile in following institutional buying and the composite index closed 7.52 higher at 810.17. The financials index, however, declined 10.04 to 988.36 as investors avoided its highly priced constituents. JAKARTA attained another 1993 high as the JKSE index rose 9.99 to 538.18. Here, banking stocks led the way, Bank Danamon putting on Rp500 at Rp5,400 and Bank Duta Rp550 at Rp5,750. TAIWAN came off intra-session highs on a round of late profit-taking. The weighted index lost a net 5.66 at 4,306.91, after reaching 4,345.86. KUALA LUMPUR picked up slightly in uncertain trading, the composite index rising by 6.51 to 957.81. Rothmans firmed MDollars 1.70 to MDollars 18.80 on approval of a restructuring plan from the Government and Securities Commission. KARACHI fell back as investors took profits after the market's recent record run. The KSE index was finally down 21.49 at 1,760.51, after a day's low of 1,746.27.</p>

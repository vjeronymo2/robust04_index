			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SCHOOL SPENDING  </P> <P> David Smollar's report that significantly more money is spent in San Diego  schools attended by students from low-income families than on schools serving  more affluent students is no news to me. Despite their extra income, the former  schools still lag in student achievement.  </P> <P> The evidence that there is little relationship between school spending and  school achievement is widespread. I recently obtained a statistical coefficient  of correlation between U.S. Department of Education figures on high school  graduation rates and the amount of money spent per student by the 50 states. It  suggests that there is absolutely no relationship between the amount spent on  students and their school achievement across the country.  </P> <P> This fact generally is either ignored or perversely contradicted by the media.  For example, Times writer Louis Sahagun's report on juvenile gangs ("Fight  Against Gangs Turns to Social solution," Part A, Nov. 11) contends that this  problem is the result of "schools that are substandard and overcrowded."  </P> <P> It may be journalistically chic to pass on this misleading assumption, but this  attitude helps not at all in our need to deal with the true causes of student  underachievement.  </P> <P> PATRICK GROFF  </P> <P> Professor, School of Teacher Education  </P> <P> San Diego State University  </P></p>

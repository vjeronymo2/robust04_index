			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Government Bonds: Sharp reversal in long-dated US Treasury prices Longer-dated US Treasury prices went into free-fall yesterday afternoon in a sharp reversal from the morning's activity, when a tame reading on consumer prices sparked a short-lived rally. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond plunged by 1 5/32 to 96 1/16 , after climbing as high as 97 7/8 early in the session. Significantly, yields breached the psychological 6.5 per cent barrier, jumping almost 9 basis points to 6.546 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was down  1/8 at 99 3/32 , to yield 4.472 per cent. Analysts said the turnround reflected the market's extreme sensitivity since the Federal Reserve tightened monetary policy two weeks ago. At first, prices at the long end surged after the Labor Department revealed that its consumer price index was unchanged last month, while prices excluding the volatile food and energy sectors were up a mere 0.1 per cent. The results were a pleasant surprise for the market, which had expected a 0.3 per cent rise in both statistics. The data were a powerful indication that inflation, which undermines the value of fixed-rate securities, remained well under control in January. The jubilant mood, however, was short-lived, as contradictory evidence surfaced during the morning. The Philadelphia Federal Reserve said the prices paid by manufacturers in the region had increased sharply, with the so-called prices-paid index in its February business outlook survey climbing to 30.4 in February, from 25.7 the previous month. The news caused the long bond to turn in its tracks and retreat to near its opening level by midday. Later the decline accelerated as speculative accounts and dealers scrambled to unload positions. With the Fed leaning toward a second strike on rates, traders saw danger signals in the Philadelphia report, which contained the kind of long-term price data which may trigger further action. Europe's government bond markets had a volatile day, rallying smartly on the Deutsche Bundesbank's discount-rate cut and lower-than-expected US inflation numbers, and then sliding back on a late bout of profit-taking. Despite Wednesday's upbeat monthly report from the German central bank, most bond dealers were not expecting a rate cut and were taken by surprise when the bank announced it was lowering its discount rate by 1/2 point to 5.25 per cent while leaving its repo rate unchanged at a fixed 6 per cent. The German rate cut was followed by similar moves in Austria, Belgium and The Netherlands, fuelling hopes that Italy and France would follow suit soon. 'The easing process is back on track,' said Mr Klaus Baader, senior international economist at Lehman Brothers in London. He expects only one week of fixed-rate repos in Germany, before a return to variable-rate repos paves the way for lower money market rates. While he said bond markets could weaken in the near term following yesterday's sharp gains, he said that prospects for continued easing would keep prices underpinned in coming weeks. Others were less sanguine. 'I'm bearish for bonds, and feel the next move will be down,' said Mr Steve Major, senior economist at Credit Lyonnais in Paris. 'The repo rate is still 6 per cent and it still costs us the same to carry bond positions.' He felt that the main boost for Europe's markets came from US January CPI numbers which prompted a sharp rally in US Treasuries. When that succumbed to profit-taking, European bonds fell with it. German bund futures soared on the rate cut news and the Liffe bund futures contract, which had opened at 98.62, rallied to a high of 99.30. However, the market fell back later and the contract touched a low of 98.38 before ending the day at 98.50. Traders said the bulk of trading took place in the futures pits, with cash activity very limited. 'In these fast markets, most investors are afraid of getting their fingers burnt,' said one trader. UK gilts had a similarly volatile day, with cash bond prices ending steady to slightly higher. Trading was largely futures-driven. The March long gilt futures contract, which opened at 116.08, rose to a high of 117.01 and ended the day at around 116.03. The Italian bond market, which suffered the worst losses in recent days, posted substantial gains on hopes for a near-term cut in interest rates.</p>

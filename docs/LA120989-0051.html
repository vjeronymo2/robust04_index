			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOESKY GETS A HAIRCUT, MOVES TO HALFWAY HOUSE IN BROOKLYN  </P> <P> Wall Street inside trader Ivan F. Boesky is out of prison and serving the last  part of his three-year sentence on the outside as a resident of a halfway  house.  </P> <P> Boesky reported to the Brooklyn Community Corrections Center on Wednesday.  </P> <P> Boesky was sentenced Dec. 18, 1987, and has served his sentence at the minimum  security prison at Lompoc, Calif. The former Wall Streeter was scheduled for  release April 4, 1990.  </P> <P> Boesky has shed the shaggy beard and long hair he was spotted sporting last  month on a furlough in Connecticut. His beard and hair had been trimmed when he  was seen returning to the halfway house in a rented auto just before the 6 p.m.  deadline.  </P> <P> If Boesky finds work, his curfew stretches to 9 p.m., and he will be eligible  for a weekend pass. The once-powerful stock speculator, who agreed to pay $100  million in penalties to the Securities and Exchange Commission to settle civil  charges, would have to turn over 25% of his earnings to the halfway house.  </P></p>

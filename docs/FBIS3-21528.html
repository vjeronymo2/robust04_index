			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yuryy Alyakseyew: "There Should Be Peace in the </F> World"]    [Text] The Belarusian Committee for Solidarity With Serbs  and Montenegrins [BKSSCh] has sent a letter to Supreme Soviet  Chairman Mechyslaw Hryb and Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich, in  which it appeals to "defend our Serbian brothers." "At the time  when the Slavic civilization is on the verge of physical  termination," says the letter, "we propose to take the following  steps: To establish diplomatic relations with the Federative  Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY]; to temporarily provide complex  assistance for the FRY; to denounce any sanctions against our  brothers; to reexamine the issue of Belarus' nonnuclear status  as contradictory to national security of the entire Slavic  world; and to secede from the Treaty on Nonproliferation of  Nuclear Weapons."    The BKSSCh has also issued a statement supporting the  position of the Belarusian Prime Minister V. Kebich that  indicates that "air raids in Yugoslavia can divide not only  Europe but also the entire world." "Therefore," the statements  notes, "the problems in Yugoslavia should be resolved by  peaceful means."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 15 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- The European Union  (EU) today reported that NAFTA will allow Mexico to move toward  economic development that is closer to that of its associates  and will increase its ties with the EU.    In the document "The European Union and NAFTA," the EU  indicates that NAFTA -- which was implemented in January --  "will have effects on its member nations, on the EU, and other  nations on political, trade, and investment levels."    In the document disclosed to NOTIMEX, the European  organization indicates that to the extent that the Treaty moves  Mexico closer to the "North American orbit," its relations with  the EU could be significantly increased. Although the EU is  Mexico's second ranking trading partner -- after the United  States -- this nation only represents for the EU 1.4 percent of  its total exports.    After the rules of the trilateral agreement are implemented  and as the tariffs disappear between Mexico, the United States,  and Canada, European products are expected to experience a  certain displacement by U.S. products in the Mexican market, the  EU said. Nevertheless, it ruled out the possibility that the  activity generated and reinforced in Mexico by the trade treaty  will allow greater trade expansion with the European bloc.    According to a study carried out by the EU on the effects of  the trade treaty and on EU-Mexico investment, there are  possibilities that displacement of Mexican imports from the EU  will not be adversely affected. Nevertheless, if these are  affected, the main effect will be on the goods that face greater  tariff differences with regard to U.S. and Canadian products.    The document indicates that this effect can be diminished by  the process of gradual removal of tariffs foreseen in the treaty  and by the fact that the EU is the sole supplier of a large  number of goods on a worldwide scale; therefore it does not face  competition from North America.</p>

			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Markets): Stop, proceed with caution - Diary of a Private Investor / Kevin Goldstein-Jackson explains his share warning system The alarm sounded. I raced upstairs to find my Market Eye prices screen showing that shares in one of the companies in which I had invested had fallen to my stop-loss level, so triggering the warning. What should I do? Some people regard their stop-loss level as the price at which they must sell, if only to protect themselves against a further fall. I regard the alarm as a reason to think more seriously about the future for the shares concerned. I ask myself: is the fall just a temporary blip? After all, I do not wish to incur dealing costs by selling, only to pay more to buy back the shares a week or so later when market confidence in the company has returned. In any case, I tend to be a longer-term investor, holding on and riding out what I hope will be minor setbacks - although, in the event of really bad news, I am prepared to sell immediately. So, on hearing the alarm, I investigate immediately what has caused the share price fall? I look at the Shares on the Move and announcements pages on Market Eye and scan the teletext financial pages on BBC and Channel 4. I am particularly wary of companies issuing profits warnings unexpectedly, especially if they have produced a recent interim or annual results statement in which everything appeared to be progressing well. Why did the company not foresee the downturn in trade or other event that compelled it to issue the warning? The advantage of the Market Eye service is that it uses 'real-time' prices direct from the stock exchange, so it is possible to see movements as they happen. The problem is that a company's shares sometimes can fall so fast that, by the time I have telephoned my broker, they have dropped below my stop-loss level. This year, there seems to have been an exceptional number of sharp price movements in shares of individual companies. One was Silentnight: in March, its shares dropped by 18p in a day because of a profits warning. Fortunately, I did not have any Silentnight shares - but I did see my pension fund's holding in OIS International drop by 18p in a day because of a profits warning in July. A stop-loss system is particularly useful in protecting against shares that rise one day, fall another, then rise and fall again regularly - but with each fall being greater than the rise. In such a case, it is all too easy to lose track of the fact that, overall, the shares are on a downwards trend. This is especially important with a widely-spread portfolio where it is difficult to remember exactly all the details of every share: original purchase price, pattern of trading and so on. Market Eye recently has launched a service in which real-time share price information can be imported automatically into spreadsheets, technical analysis and charting programmes on personal computers. An investor can create his own alarm system which could be activated because of particular patterns in the price movements of an individual company, or even a sector as a whole. The problem still remains, however, that most people are like me: they have neither the time nor inclination to sit at home watching a share price screen or waiting for an alarm to sound. It is all too likely that the alarm will go off when the investor is out at work, walking on the beach or travelling overseas. I asked the Association of Private Client Investment Managers and Stockbrokers if it had a list of brokers who might be able to operate a simple stop-loss system on behalf of a private client. It could not help. Even Fidelity, a large execution-only broker, offers a stop-loss service only for US shares. Private investors must be especially careful in order to protect the value of their investments in a jittery market. In my case, I have stuck to the top of my Market Eye screen the details of what my holdings cost and the expected dates for each company to announce results. Every Saturday, I look at the Results Due columns in the FT to check that these dates have not been brought forward (or put back). A delayed announcement could be a warning signal. On a results day for one of my holdings, I try to ensure that, if I am not at home, someone looks at the screen and the teletext services and tries to contact me if there is any unexpectedly bad news. Recently, I re-adjusted all the price limits held on my portfolio pages on Market Eye. The alarm now sounds when the share price approaches my 'sell' level, rather than when it actually reaches it. The hope is that this advance warning will give me enough time to consider selling before a sharp fall. I also set limits not only to help prevent losses but to protect profits. When a share price has doubled, for example, I consider selling half my holding. This means I have recouped the cost of my entire investment while retaining half of it. Admittedly, capital gains tax usually will have to be paid on the profits. But, having made such a profit, at least I can be more relaxed about the future performance of the remaining shares. For some people, a long-term investment often is one that was bought in the hope of short-term profits that have not materialised. Instead, the price has fallen steadily but the investors hold on in the hope the shares might recover one day. Stop-loss alarms help to concentrate the mind on retaining only investments that are likely genuinely to perform over the longer term.</p>

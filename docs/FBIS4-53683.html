			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 20 KYODO -- The Ministry of  International Trade and Industry (MITI) will urge Japanese  electric power and major city gas suppliers to avoid raising  their rates after October, ministry officials said Friday [20  May]. The power and gas utilities in November 1993 implemented  a temporary cut in their rates, valid until September, to pass  on the benefits of the yen's appreciation against the dollar to  consumers. The stronger yen has reduced crude oil import costs  for the utilities.    The rate cut has lowered the monthly electric power bill for  the standard household by 100 yen and the city gas cost by 138  yen.    The government said Wednesday it will freeze until the end  of  the year proposed hikes in public service charges, including  power and gas rates, public transportation fares and telephone  rates. But Hiroshi Watanabe, chairman of the Japan Gas  Association, told reporters Thursday that member companies plan  to end the rate cut after October.</p>

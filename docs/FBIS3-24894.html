			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] President Yoweri Museveni, who is on the third  day of a working visit to Gulu District, has warned the  candidates for the Constituent Assembly elections to desist from  confusing the public with lies in a bid to get votes.    Addressing a public rally yesterday at (Kochgoma) health  center, in Gulu District, President Museveni pointed out that  one of the remaining major weaknesses among the people are  politicians whose politics is lies. He reminded the people who  gathered to listen to him that, in the past, Uganda had been  reduced to a laughing stock by leaders whose main characteristic  was lies.    Explaining that it is his duty as a leader to expose such  lies for what they are, President Museveni enumerated the major  lies being spread around by some of the aspiring candidates, and  challenged those spreading them to come out in public and  substantiate them.    He dismissed the lie that the National Resistance Movement  [NRM] government had sold land to foreigners as nonsensical, and  asked the propagators to explain to the public under what law  the contract or arrangement for this has been done. In the same  light, Museveni dismissed the allegation that the NRM government  has sold the Murchison Falls National Park to foreigners, saying  that the government has only given permission to various  companies to build or rehabilitate hotels in the parks.    He also condemned politicians who go around discouraging the  people from paying taxes and emphasized that the people of  Uganda need to be aware that they must finance the biggest  portion of the national budget. He, however, advised the  district leaders to assess the tax of peasants realistically and  correctly, according to their income.    Museveni also dismissed the talk being propagated that the  NRM government is a government of Banyarwanda [tribe]. He said  that the NRM government is a government of the people of Uganda  in their entirety. He explained that Banyarwanda make one of  the tribes of Uganda and they occupy the District of Kisoro  which is part of Uganda. He therefore challenged the  propagators of this lie to tell the people of Uganda what should  be done about the District of Kisoro which is in Uganda.    Mr. Museveni strongly warned those people who go around  trying to foment hatred among the people that they are not only  violating the Constituent Assembly statute but they are also  breaking the law.    On the issue of compensating the cattle which was eaten by  the NRA [National Resistance Army] during the period of  insurgency in the north, President Museveni assured the people  that they will definitely be paid and that the money is now  available and will be paid out in phases. [passage omitted]    The rally was also addressed by the former head of state,  General Tito Okello Lutwa, who expressed happiness at being back  home after years in exile. The general, who expressed total  disgust with some of the brutal acts carried out by the rebels  during the period of insurgency, called on the people of Gulu  District and Acholis in general to unite and totally reject such  inhuman acts.

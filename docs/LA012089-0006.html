			<p><P> January 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOARD TO REVISE WATER PLAN IN BID TO SATISFY ALL  </P> <P> Bowing to pressure from urban Southern California and agricultural interests,  the state Water Resources Control Board agreed Thursday to revise a  controversial draft plan that was designed to improve water quality in the  Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and San Francisco Bay.  </P> <P> The revisions will delay the court-ordered plan by at least six months as the  water board's staff attempts to rewrite the proposal in a manner that will  satisfy water users in the southern part of the state as well as Northern  California environmentalists.  </P> <P> "There has been some justifiable criticism of the draft report," W. Don  Maughan, board chairman, said after the board's decision. "There is justifiable  criticism that we haven't gotten all the input that we should."  </P> <P> The purpose of the plan was to develop water quality standards for San  Francisco Bay, which over the years has suffered increased pollution and a  reduced flow of water due to the diversion of water from the delta to other  parts of the state.  </P> <P> But the initial draft proposal released last November generated considerable  opposition because it called for limiting the amount of water shipped to  Southern California to 1985 levels and imposing a strict program of water  conservation as the population of the area continues to grow.  </P> <P> Among other changes, Maughan said, the next draft of the plan will not include  recommendations for a limit on water exports to Southern California. Instead,  the agency will turn to that thorny question in later discussions when it  considers how to implement the proposal.  </P> <P> Maughan said he had always envisioned revising the plan after a lengthy series  of public hearings. The original draft, he said, was simply a starting point  for discussion.  </P> <P> However, the proposal so angered farming interests and Southern California  water importers that some critics of the plan began lobbying Gov. George  Deukmejian not to reappoint Maughan when his 4-year term as board chairman  officially expired last Sunday.  </P> <P> Under the law, Deukmejian has until March 14 to reappoint Maughan or name  someone else to the post. Earlier this week, the governor said he had been too  busy with other issues to focus yet on the appointment. "It's just something  that hasn't really come up to me yet," he told reporters.  </P> <P> Maughan said the efforts to remove him had not affected the board's decision  and that he had received no instructions from the governor's office on how to  handle the controversy.  </P> <P> Furthermore, Maughan said, as the agency revises the plan it will continue to  take into account environmental interests as well as the needs of agriculture  and urban development.  </P> <P> "Sure, there's a lot of pressure been brought to bear," Maughan said. "But I  also think we're going to look at all these environmental issues equally as we  are (those raised by) the water industry."  </P> <P> Efforts to set water quality standards for San Francisco Bay are certain to  continue to be controversial. Environmentalists and fishing interests are  seeking increased flows from the Sacramento and San Joaquin river systems to  provide an adequate habitat for fish and to flush pollution out of the delta  and the bay.  </P> <P> At the same time, water suppliers to Southern California want to guarantee  sufficient water for the region's burgeoning population and Central Valley  farmers are determined to protect their water supply.  </P></p>

Hiserodt, M.D., Ph.D.: An inquiry conducted by the University of Pittsburgh and an investigation conducted by the Office of Research Integrity found that Dr. Hiserodt deliberately and knowingly falsified four figures and one table in two research grant applications submitted to the National Institutes of Health, and deliberately and knowingly fabricated a laboratory notebook to cover-up the falsifications in the grant applications. In reporting research results on antigen recognition by natural killer cells, Dr. Hiserodt falsely reported that a purportedly unique protein had a molecular weight of 48 kilodaltons by altering photographs of autoradiograms, falsely reported that this protein had been found in human cells, falsely reported the results of a gene sequence in response to questions raised by NIH grant reviewers about his experimental findings, and fabricated a laboratory notebook to cover-up the falsified research when questions about it were raised by investigating officials. Dr. Hiserodt has been debarred from receiving Federal grant or contract funds for a period of five years beginning March 9, 1994. In addition, any institution receiving PHS research support involving Dr. Hiserodt must monitor the accuracy of his research for an additional two-year period following the five-year debarment (for a total period of seven years) beginning March 9, 1999. He has also been prohibited from serving on PHS Advisory Committees or review groups for seven years beginning February 25, 1994. Dr. Hiserodt is also required to request correction of the article ``The Expression and Functional Involvement of Laminin-like Molecules in Non-MHC Restricted Cytotoxicity by Human Leu-19+/CD3-Natural Killer Lymphocytes,'' Journal of Immunology, Vol. 141, 3318&hyph;23, 1988, to indicate that Figure 2 in the article may not be relied upon. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Director, Division of Research Investigations, Office of Research Integrity, 301&hyph;443&hyph;5330. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Lyle W.

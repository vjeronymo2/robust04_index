Presenting the prestigious  award at the Ashoka Hall in Rashtrapati Bhavan [President House]  in New Delhi today, the president, Dr. Shankar Dayal Sharma,  described Mr. Havel as a champion of human rights. He said Dr.  Havel has done a (?signal) service in providing politics its  moral dimension.    Speaking on the occasion, the prime minister, Mr. Narasimha  Rao, said India has an exemplary record on human rights. He  said the aspersion on India's record on this issue is caused by  those who themselves do not have any respect for human dignity.  Mr. Rao described the president of the new republic as the  father of democratic movement in Europe. The award carries 25  lakh rupees and a plaque.    The Czech president described the award as the best tribute  to the people of his country, who waged a relentless struggle  against the totalitarian regime through nonviolence. The vice  president, Mr. Dr. K.R. Narayanan, and the chairperson of the  Indira Gandhi Memorial Trust, Mrs. Sonia Gandhi, also spoke on  the occasion.    Later, addressing a press conference, Dr. Vaclav Havel said  there is great potential for economic cooperation between India  and his country. He observed that both countries are pursuing  economic reforms and there is a need for exchanging information  about the opportunities available in each country. In this  regard, Mr. Havel sought to have an investment protection  agreement with India and hoped that the draft agreement  submitted by his delegation in this regard will be formalized by  the middle of this year. Expressing his satisfaction at the  discussions with the Indian leaders and businessmen, he said two  agreements on trade and avoidance of double taxation have been  signed.    Replying to a question on supplying spare parts to Indian  defense equipment, Mr. Havel said there is no reason why his  country should not export defense equipment to peace-loving  democratic countries. He, however, firmly said that the Czech  Republic will not export defense equipment to some countries  which were receiving armaments from the former Czechoslovakia.  The deputy prime minister of the Czech Republic, Mr. Ivan  Kocarnik, said companies from his country will now onwards  participate in tenders for projects in India. A delegation of  Indian businessmen will visit Prague soon to establish relations  with the Czech businessmen.    Earlier, the prime minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao, and the  visiting Czech president, Dr. Havel, discussed the possibilities  of cooperation in several areas between the two countries at  their meeting in New Delhi today. Mr. Rao said India was  particularly interested in the cooperation in infrastructure  development. The two leaders deliberated on the role and  relevance of the United Nations. Mr. Rao said India was  committed to the UN and its democratization. He also accepted  the Czech president's invitation to visit the Czech Republic.</p>

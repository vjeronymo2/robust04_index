			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / International Company News: Retiring Ford chief warns on excess capacity EXCESS capacity is the biggest problem currently facing the world auto industry, Mr Harold Poling, who is to retire as chairman and chief executive of Ford at the end of the month, has warned. 'Overcapacity will result in some down-sizing and some consolidating in the world industry for the rest of the decade,' said Mr Poling. The worldwide recessions had masked 'the more fundamental concern' of overcapacity, said Mr Alex Trotman, who will take over as chairman, chief executive and president of Ford from November 1. 'Overcapacity will cause the consolidation and restructuring of the auto industry worldwide,' said Mr Trotman. 'Not everyone will be around by the end of the century, certainly not in their current configurations.' Both Mr Poling and Mr Trotman ruled out any early move by Ford to increase its present 24.5 per cent stake in Mazda, the troubled Japanese carmaker, which warned recently that it faced losses of around Y32bn (Dollars 302m) this year. 'It is a key issue how we go with Mazda in the next 10 years. They do have serious problems,' said Mr Trotman. 'We have no plans to increase our stake in Mazda. It is a big decision for us. The terrain is changing with the difficulties they are having in Japan.' Mr Poling said that Ford, which lost Dollars 2.76bn in 1991 and 1992 (before a one-time charge of Dollars 6.88bn, principally to fund healthcare payments for retired workers) had to strive to be a low-cost producer. 'When you are the low-cost producer you are in charge and regardless of what the opposition does, they will hurt more than you do.' Both Mr Poling and Mr Trotman indicated that a member of the Ford family could succeed to the chairmanship. The corporation has been been led by non-family members since Henry Ford II resigned from the chairmanship in 1980. Two great grandsons of Mr Henry Ford, the founder, are currently on the Ford board. Mr Edsel Ford II, 45, the only son of the late Henry Ford II, is president and chief operating officer of Ford Motor Credit, while Mr William Clay Ford Jnr is general manager of the climate control division. Both now serve on the board's executive and finance committees. Mr Trotman said that Ford's worldwide capital spending in the next few years would 'substantially exceed' the Dollars 30bn spent in the five years to 1992. Overall profitability was improving - it earned Dollars 1.35bn in the first six months of the year - but its financial performance was still burdened by higher marketing costs, lower capacity utilisation and record spending worldwide on new product programmes. US new car sales remained below trend and the economies of most large European markets continued to worsen.</p>

			<p><P> April 17, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATES PAY BIGGER SHARE FOR HIGHWAYS, BRIDGES;  </P> <P> TRANSPORTATION: NEW SURVEY ALSO FINDS INCREASE IN GAS TAXES. THE FINDINGS RAISE  DOUBTS ABOUT BUSH'S CALL FOR LEGISLATURES TO PLAY A GREATER FUNDING ROLE.  </P> <P> State and local governments are bearing an increasing share of the burden of  rebuilding the nation's highways and bridges, and states have raised their gas  taxes 122 times since 1980, according to a survey released today.  </P> <P> Although the survey was simply intended to provide statistical information, it  raises questions about the feasibility of the Bush Administration's recent call  for states and local governments to play an even greater role in highway  construction and maintenance.  </P> <P> The Road Information Program (TRIP), a nonprofit Washington-based  transportation research institute, said its survey found that state and local  governments bore 77.6% of the cost of highway improvements in 1988, compared to  74% in 1980. That represented state expenditures of $53.53 billion in 1988,  compared to $28.54 billion in 1980.  </P> <P> The survey also found that states have already boosted their gas taxes by an  average 84% -- from 8.6 cents a gallon in 1980 to 15.8 cents a gallon by Jan.  1, 1990. Some states have raised their gas taxes three or more times during  that period, including Wisconsin (five times), Minnesota and Indiana (four) and  South Carolina and Nevada (three), the report said.  </P> <P> In California, TRIP's findings were hailed by proponents of a June ballot  initiative to double the state's 9-cent-a-gallon gas tax over five years. If  voters approve Proposition 111, the revenues generated would be dedicated to  highway improvements.  </P> <P> Arthur Bauer, executive director of Californians for Better Transportation, a  group that favors Proposition 111, said the report shows that California lags  behind the nation in increasing its gas sales tax.  </P> <P> "Some states already have 20-cent gas taxes," he said. "We're hoping to get to  18 cents over the next five years. This helps illustrate the differences  between states."  </P> <P> TRIP collected the data contained in the report by surveying highway  departments in the 50 states and the District of Columbia, as well as using  information supplied by the Federal Highway Administration, the American Assn.  of State Highway and Transportation Officials and other government and private  organizations.  </P> <P> "This report is a response to the Administration's saying that the states have  to pick up more funding responsibility," said Sally Thompson, a TRIP researcher  and the report's author. "What they've been calling for may not be possible  since the states have been picking up the responsibility all along."  </P> <P> Last month, Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner released the  Administration's national transportation policy, which outlined the  deteriorating status of the nation's infrastructure but offered no federal  programs or methods to pay for needed repairs. Instead, the policy urged state  legislatures to offset a diminished federal role by increasing state taxes,  seeking private-sector involvement and employing innovative financial deals for  highway projects.  </P> <P> But TRIP's report said many state governments are already trying to compensate  for less federal aid with the kind of programs called for in the  Administration's national transportation policy.  </P> <P> It added that the states are just as strapped for money as the federal  government, and often end up using highway funds for other purposes.  </P> <P> "Money collected from user charges such as motor-fuel taxes and registration  fees is being diverted to unrelated areas, such as mass transit, education and  law enforcement," the report said. "In fact, 18 states considered legislation  (to allow diversions of highway funds) in 1989 and 11 passed legislation."  </P> <P> TRIP researchers asked state officials to list their "top three highway"  priorities, and 30 of the 41 responding to the question "spoke of the need for  stronger federal support," the report said.  </P> <P> The state officials' response was "in direct contrast" to the Administration's  "call for an increased state role," Thompson said. However, the report also  noted that "states are reluctantly accepting the fact that the federal  government is not going to provide the regular, adequate highway funding they  desperately need -- not now and not in future years."  </P> <P> The survey also showed that state officials are strongly opposed to increasing  the federal gas tax to reduce the deficit, as has been suggested in Washington  recently.  </P> <P> "A total of 41 respondents said such a tax would have a devastating impact on  their highway programs," the report said. It noted that 29 states passed  resolutions last year opposing a federal gas tax increase to reduce the budget  deficit.  </P> <P> State officials are more inclined to support the spending of federal motor fuel  taxes already collected and held in the Highway Trust Fund, the report said.  </P> <P> "We would like to see (the Administration) spend down the Highway Trust Fund,"  Art Taylor, a spokesman for the Missouri Highway and Transportation Department,  said in an interview. "Once that money is spent down, we're not opposed to the  federal government raising its gasoline tax."  </P> <P> The fund has a surplus of about $10 billion and it grows yearly since receipts  continue to outpace expenditures by about $2 billion a year.  </P></p>

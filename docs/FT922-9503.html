			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Riots force Lebanese premier to quit MR OMAR Karami, Lebanon's prime minister, and his 30-member cabinet resigned yesterday after anti-government riots spread throughout the country. The departure of the pro-Syrian premier after two days' civil unrest may diminish Syria's influence in Lebanon and presage a more independent line for his successor. It is the first time a Lebanese government has been toppled by civil unrest since the country's civil war began in 1975. Thousands of rioters took to the streets of Beirut and other Lebanese cities early yesterday, brandishing sticks, shovels and pistols. Main roads were blocked by heaps of blazing tyres. They smashed windows of government offices, banks and shops and set up barricades of burning tyres. Two teenagers were wounded when looters broke into Beirut's Arab Bank. Rioting broke out on Tuesday after radio reports that the Lebanese pound had collapsed to about LPounds 2,000 to the US dollar on the black market. But violence subsided after Mr Karami's resignation was announced. 'I have resigned to save the country,' the 57-year-old lawyer said after meeting President Elias Hrawi. The unrest has been sparked by Lebanon's economic crisis. For the first time, Lebanese of all faiths, trade unionists, industrialists, bankers and business people united in denunciation of the government and support for a four-day general strike aimed at ending its mandate. The country's main trade union is scheduled to reassess the strike today. Because the Karami half-Christian, half-Moslem cabinet was installed under Syrian supervision in December 1990, Lebanese rejection of the government constitutes a growing resentment of Syria's hold over the country. The Treaty of Brotherhood, Co-operation and Co-ordination signed with Syria last May required Lebanon to link its economic, foreign and security policies with those of Damascus, which keeps 40,000 troops in Lebanon. The Syrian presence made the disarming of Lebanese militias possible, but in recent months the Syrian embrace has choked public confidence and potential foreign investors. Lebanese leaders have made no important decisions without travelling to Damascus for 'consultations'. Mr Karami had sought Syrian approval in a trip to the Syrian capital on Tuesday before he resigned. Mr Karami, a Sunni Moslem, feuded openly with President Hrawi, a Maronite Catholic. When Mr Hrawi pleaded with Syrian officials for permission to replace Mr Karami in March, the Syrians refused, saying the Karami government would have to oversee parliamentary elections soon. A new cabinet is unlikely to be announced immediately. Officials in Beirut suggested the decision may take a few days. Most popular candidates to replace Mr Karami are Dr Selim El Hoss, the former prime minister, and Mr Rafiq Hariri, the Lebanese-born Saudi millionaire. Mr Hariri, a friend of the Saudi royal family, would appear well placed to obtain Saudi economic aid for Lebanon. Both men have in recent days met Syrian leaders in Damascus. Both are believed to have demanded greater independence from Syria as a condition for becoming premier. Syria's strategy regarding the crisis in Lebanon remains unclear. Many rioters in southern Lebanon and Beirut were members of the Syrian-backed Amal militia, and Syrian troops made no attempt to intervene during the disturbances. Damascus could seek to impose an even closer ally as prime minister, perhaps Gen Sami Khatib, interior minister, who was among those who resigned yesterday.</p>

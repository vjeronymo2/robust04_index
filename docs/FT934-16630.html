			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: China sees free market solution to gold problems - Plans to end the 44-year-old state purchasing monopoly CHINA HAS foreshadowed the establishment of an international gold market to facilitate trade in the precious metal and enliven flagging local production. This important step would end a 44-year-old state monopoly on gold purchases. Mr Cui Dewen, Vice-President of the gold administration under the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, said last week that the end of the People's Bank  -China's central bank - monopoly on gold purchases was overdue and the best way to curb a raging black market. 'A standardised gold market is a must to bring the gold industry under market management,' he told the English Language China Daily. He gave no hint, however, on when such a step might be taken. Mr Cui's remarks follow the government's move last month nearly to double the state purchase price from Yn51.2 to Yn96 a gramme (USDollars 520 a troy ounce at the official rate, but Dollars 346 at the open market rate) to reflect the metal's value in the international market. The China Daily article said Mr Cui indicated that the establishment of an official gold market would be accompanied by a crackdown on flourishing black markets in the big gold producing provinces. State gold purchases fell by more than 50 per cent in the first six months of this year compared with the same period last year as miners either withheld product or sold on the black market. China is also taking steps to open its gold-mining sector to foreign involvement. It has been circulating a draft law that would end an effective ban on foreign participation in the gold sector, but miners are being told that they will be restricted to marginal areas. The China Daily quoted Mr Ai Dacheng, a senior official of the gold administration, as saying that a list of mines open to foreign involvement would be announced next month. He noted that big gold producers from the US, Canada, Australia and South Africa had shown interest in exploring China's resources. But among barriers to their participation was the country's state gold purchase monopoly. Foreign mining executives had made it clear to China that the freeing of the local gold market was one of the first requirement for international involvement, Mr Ai said. The representatives were also pressing for 'realistic' royalties on gold produced. In draft legislation presented at a recent conference in Beijing, China proposed a royalty of 10 per cent, but representatives of companies like Newmont Mining of the US, CRA of Australia and Cominco of Canada indicated that this was unacceptably high compared with rates of 2 to 3 per cent in many developing countries. China has about 600 gold mines, but many are tiny and employ primitive methods. At least one-third are estimated to have been losing money because of the low state purchase price, and spiralling productions costs. Mr Cui said that the new local price for gold would track that on the London market with a slight discount. He indicated that it might take some time for an international market to develop locally. But he was adamant that it would be part of an important reform of China's financial markets. 'The gold market, like that in many other countries, will play a key role in China's financial market,' he said, adding that further reforms of China's foreign exchange system were required. China's official gold production last year reached about 110 tonnes, compared with demand of 250 tonnes. Since restrictions were eased on domestic gold sales in the past year or so, the Chinese have emerged as the world's leading purchasers of gold jewellery. Driving demand for gold in China is the desire of many people to hedge against inflation, which reached 17 per cent in urban centres in the first six months of this year. In its present five-year plan (1991-95) China planned to spend UDollars 1.3bn on exploration and development of its gold deposits. Estimates of in-ground gold reserves stand at about 3,000 tonnes. China's People's Bank is reported to have been a seller of gold recently, and this is one of the reasons advanced for the dip in the gold price internationally. The bank last year purchased a substantial portion of the 400 tonnes of gold sold by the Netherlands central bank. China has not published its gold reserves statistics since 1981.</p>

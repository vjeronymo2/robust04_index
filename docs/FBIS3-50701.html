Official Spokesman Eloy Cantu stated last night that the  government had virtually recovered control of San Cristobal de  las Casas, Ocosingo, Las Margaritas, and Altamirano, population  centers occupied by the so-called Zapatist National Liberation  Army [EZLN].    Nevertheless, in reporting on the events that took place in  Chiapas, the aforementioned Mexican Government spokesman  explained that "there are still specific areas where conditions  of insecurity still persist." "Institutional life and normalcy  are painstakingly being recovered, in other words, with each  passing moment civilian authority is being reinstated," Cantu  stated.    Dozens of bodies with evidence of bullet wounds where laying  along Ocosingo's streets after the Army was able establish  control of the last population center taken by the armed group.  The rebel groups decided to withdraw to the mountain region  located in the north-central part of Chiapas.    In Ocosingo, located 800 kms south east of Mexico City,  Zapatista members attempted to hold on to the last population  center it originally took. After taking over the first four  communities, the up until now unknown EZLN began to appear in  other communities such as Abasolo, Chanal del Carmen, and  Oxchuc. During the last few hours the rebel group also withdrew  from Oxchuc. [Passages omitted]</p>

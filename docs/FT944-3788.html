			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Summit of the Americas: Chile to move soon towards Nafta The first steps towards Chilean accession to the North American Free Trade Agreement are expected to be made as soon as next week. The Nafta members - the US, Canada and Mexico - will discuss negotiating procedures and begin to develop entrance criteria, which will apply to Chile and subsequent prospective members. The criteria are expected to include macro-economic performance, adherence to multilateral trade rules, the openness of the economy, intellectual property and investment protection. Four-way preliminary talks are expected to begin as early as January, with formal negotiations after a ministerial meeting to be held no later than May. Five special committees will be set up to examine issues such as market access measures, including rules of origin, subsidies and anti-dumping rules, agriculture and dispute settlement. The US said no time-frame had been set for concluding negotiations, but Chile's finance minister, Mr Eduardo Aninat, said he hoped the accession agreement could be signed within 14-15 months of the January start to talks. 'We think we meet virtually all the requirements to become a Nafta member,' he said. The US administration will start working with Congress 'early next year' to seek 'fast track' negotiating powers. This would only be needed, it said, to conclude the negotiations, not to begin them. Negotiations with Chile are unlikely to provoke as much domestic opposition as did the talks with Mexico. The Chilean economy is less than a hundredth of that of the US, its southern hemisphere harvests do not clash so much with those of US agricultural producers, and there are no border issues to resolve. Chile is also seeking associate status with Mercosur, the customs union of Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay. Full membership of a separate customs union is incompatible with Nafta membership, though a free trade arrangement by Chile and Mercosur is possible. Mr Aninat expressed optimism that progress could also be made in integration with Mercosur.</p>

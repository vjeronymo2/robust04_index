			<p><P> March 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The Sudanese government and rebels in southern Sudan have agreed to a "month of  tranquillity" to permit passage of food needed to avert a famine, a U.N.  official said. James P. Grant, executive director of the U.N. Children's Fund  (UNICEF), said the plan calls for eight "corridors of peace" through which  relief supplies will flow. The lull in fighting is to begin April 1 to allow  hauling of supplies before rains that begin in May make roads impassable.  </P></p>

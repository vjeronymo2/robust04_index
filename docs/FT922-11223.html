			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / Spain faces labour unrest Spain is facing serious labour unrest this summer and autumn, following the announcement at the weekend by the General Workers Union (UGT) that it is to hold a half-day stoppage next month, and a general strike of possibly 48 hours in October, both in protest at government cuts in unemployment benefits, writes Peter Bruce in Madrid. The UGT and the other large union, the communist-led Workers' Commissions (CCOO) are to meet this week to co-ordinate further action. Both unions are promising a series of rolling sectoral strikes if the government does not withdraw its decree to cut unemployment payments.</p>

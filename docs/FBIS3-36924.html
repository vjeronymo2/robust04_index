The argument over the property between the joint-stock  company PRAVDA International Steelight Holdings Limited and the  PRAVDA staff members looks like a detective story. On April 23,  1991, Gennadiy Seleznev, then PRAVDA editor-in-chief, signed an  agreement with the Cyprus firm Steelight Holdings Limited, under  which all rights to the publication of the newspaper were passed  over to the joint-stock company, in which the Cyprus firm has  the controlling block of stocks (55 per cent). According to  PRAVDA workers, they learned about the terms of the deal some  time later.    The board of the PRAVDA journalists' organisation regards  the  court ruling as illegal. PRAVDA staff members intend to defend  their rights, using all legal means. Despite legal  complications, they are going to continue the publication of the  newspaper. Aside from it, they intend to bring a couter-charge,  questioning the validity of the agreements signed by Seleznev  and the Cyprus firm.</p>

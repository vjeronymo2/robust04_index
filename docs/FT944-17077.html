			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Survey of Business Travel (19): Old World down under in New Norcia - Staying on / Keith Wheatley visits a Benedictine monastery in western Australia Thieves who bound and gagged Benedictine monks to steal several million pounds worth' of 17th century European religious paintings made headlines around the world. But it was not so much the crime as the location - a lonely monastery 80 miles north of Perth, western Australia - that caught the public's imagination. In the accepted cultural order of things, works by Murillo, Pietro da Cortona and Ribera belong in the shuttered calm of European galleries. It came as a shock to realise that the greatest such collection in the southern hemisphere was held by a dwindling band of brothers in the empty sheep country of western Australia. But then New Norcia does come as a shock. Driving north on the lonely highway out of Perth, it rises out of the carpeted green hills like a vision of Old Spain. Turreted neo-gothic castles in pink and white face an abbey church whose spire must pine for the Mediterranean. Along cloisters roofed with corrugated iron, yet possessing the tranquillity of the Old World, black-cowled monks hurry to Vespers. The older ones exchange greetings in Spanish. Their day begins at 4.00am - early even by the rigorous standards of the Australian outback. The single bell that summoned the brothers to Lauds, first of the seven canonical hours, calls out across the Victoria plains. Fifteen thousand acres of it belong to the monastery, although it is farmed by tenants. In better times it made the community of 30 monks wealthy, but the problems of agriculture have hit devout and pagan alike. At least a dozen of the monks are old enough to receive state pensions. This income funds many of the monastery's day-to-day needs. Providing a retreat for the stressed urbanite will keep the community afloat in future years. A new 'hotel' wing has been added. 'The guests will be the focus of our activities in future years,' said one of the brothers. Visitors are a double-edged sword, however. Insurance advisers have intimated that in future an armed guard must watch over the pictures. The empty white walls where the masterpieces once hung provide a sad counterpoint to the tale of how the collection, and the community, came into being. It largely reflects the efforts of one man, Dom Rosendo Salvado. He was a Spanish-born Benedictine monk. Anxious to perform missionary work, he persuaded Pope Gregory XVI to send him to Western Australia, where there was a newly appointed Catholic bishop. In 1846 Salvado landed in Fremantle. The colony was then 17 years old and not much of the area beyond Perth and the Swan river valley was settled. With a flock of monks and supporters, Salvado trekked north. The first expedition virtually starved to death in the bush, but a second start was made at the present site five years later. The oldest wing of the monastery dates from that time but feels older. The uneven floor planking of local jarrah wood possesses an almost medieval texture. Contemporaries of Salvado recorded how he found relaxation, on his hands and knees, polishing the deep brown timber. He was a remarkable man by every account. Much of the present road south to Perth he cut single-handed from the bush with an axe. Salvado's mental gifts made him a sought-after correspondent in European society of the late 19th century. Letters to Salvado from Queen Isabella of Spain lie in the archives, as do a series from Florence Nightingale. One one occasion the abbot was visiting Italy and was presented with a complete set of uniforms and instruments for a brass band. He sent them back to Australia ahead of his return. When Salvado did reach home he was met by Aboriginal boys, rehearsed and excellently drilled as the New Norcia Brass Band. Queen Isabella laid the foundation for the art collection, giving New Norcia an especially fine Murillo in the 1860s. Other monks began to seek out paintings. As recently as the middle of this century, a Ribera was secured for Dollars 50 at a Melbourne auction, but most acquisitions were donations. As the monastery expanded and became more secure, the work of the monks increased. They sank more than 200 wells in the area, imported bees, planted vines and founded what were to become four boarding schools catering for both aboriginal and white children. Each group of students was taught and administered by a different religious order, although the Benedictines retained overall control. If ever God had a 'company town', it was New Norcia 50 years ago. If the focus of the settlement has now shifted to the visitor, nowhere is that more evident than at the New Norcia Hotel. Designed in 1927 by Father Urbano Giminez as a hostel for the visiting parents of pupils, it is one of the most imposing buildings in the state. The colonnaded facade, with its deep, cool verandas, opens into a hallway with a double staircase that would be the equal of a Mayfair or Belgravia town-house. It is an endearing mixture of the grand and of a run-down country hotel.</p>

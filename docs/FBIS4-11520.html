			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Pedro Aspe, finance and public </F> credit secretary, in Washington, by Jacobo Zabludovsky, in the  Mexico City studio; from the "24 Hours" newscast -- live]    [Text] [Zabludovsky] The finance secretaries of Canada, the  United States, and Mexico, as well as the directors of the three  respective central banks, signed an agreement in Washington this  morning. Could you tell us what was signed?    [Aspe] Today at the U.S. Treasury Department, we signed an  agreement that has, basically, three components. In the first,  the reciprocal $6-billion line of support [linea de apoyo]  between the United States and Mexico was ratified. In the  second, Canada, forming part of a trilateral effort involving  the United States, Canada, and Mexico, joins the U.S. and  Mexican effort with an additional financial line of support for  1 billion Canadian dollars. The third component creates a  consultation group called the Financial Group of North America  [Grupo Financiero de America del Norte].    [Zabludovsky] Could you please explain the importance of  these agreements?    [Aspe] Regarding the reciprocal line of support, I have two  comments. The first one is that the reciprocal line of support  with the United States was ratified, and now it has been made  permanent; this is what is important. These lines of support  existed before, but they were temporary and had fixed deadlines.  Now, fortunately, within the framework of an atmosphere of  cooperation as equals, we have been able to make this $6-billion  line of support permanent.    Second, Canada's participation, also on a permanent basis,  represents big support. Previously, we had a 200-million  Canadian dollar line of support with Canada; this has been  multiplied by five and now amounts to more than 1 billion  Canadian dollars.    The third component, and perhaps the most important, is that  this financial group, called the Financial Group of North  America, has been created. The three finance secretaries and  the three directors of the central banks of these three  countries will meet periodically to coordinate macroeconomic  policies and to make economic and financial consultations. This  is a most important step in this era of global and interrelated  markets.    [Zabludovsky] Has Mexico used the U.S. $6-billion line of  support?    [Aspe] No. Fortunately, we have not had to use it. We  could have been using it since 25 March, but we have an adequate  level of reserves, and for this reason we have not drawn from  this line.    [Zabludovsky] The creation of this group, which goes into  effect today, reminds me of what was done in Europe with the  creation of a credit and monetary unit. Is there any similarity?    [Aspe] Yes. A financial group similar to the one the United  States, Canada, and our country created today was created by the  European countries some time ago. During the first phase, which  is the only one to which we have committed ourselves so far, we  will exchange information and make consultations on  macroeconomic matters.    In Europe, this eventually resulted, as we all know, in the  European central banks' offering each other total support. We  are in the first phase that involves more interrelation and  periodic meetings. The deputy directors of the central banks  and the under secretaries of the three treasury departments will  meet four or five times a year. The heads of the central banks  and the finance secretariats, or treasury departments, will meet  at least once a year to coordinate our policies.    This is very important for Mexico because in this way we  will  have access to key information, considering that both the United  States and Canada are members of the Group of Seven, and,  therefore, we can secure a lot of information within the  framework of this new relation between the two countries.    [Zabludovsky] I want to take advantage of my conversation  with you to broach a Mexican domestic problem. As a result of  the tragic and cruel death of Luis Donaldo Colosio, financial  markets have been upset; how has this affected Mexico?    [Aspe] Domestic markets were obviously negatively affected  as a result of the brutal and unfair assassination of Luis  Donaldo Colosio.    Furthermore, two virtually concurrent events took place  abroad, which I would like to comment on later to explain how  the Salinas administration handled the situation. The two  negative events that took place abroad are that during the first  few months of 1994, interest rates in the United States  increased considerably. You may recall that long-term interest  rates in the United States were approximately 5 to 5.5 percent  only three months ago, and at present they are well above 7  percent, meaning interest rates have increased in the United  States, and this has had negative repercussions throughout the  world and, of course, in Mexico.    The second negative international occurrence we have  encountered is that the stock markets of all the emergent  economies -- the word emergent has been used to describe  countries such as Chile, Thailand, Malaysia, Argentina and, of  course, Mexico -- suffered considerable reductions during the  first few months of the year. This was due in part to the fact  that many of the investment funds that purchase shares on the  emergent international markets did so -- to use the jargon of  economists -- through connections [apalancados]; in other words,  they did so with loans to purchase shares. When shares increase  in value there is no problem, but when they lose value these  international funds have to sell shares to maintain their  collateral and guarantees, intensifying the downward trend.  This is why markets in Thailand dropped 30 percent, 25 percent  in Malaysia, and the same happened in Argentina, Chile, and  Mexico. There can be no question, however, the hardest blow to  the economy was the tragic death of Luis Donaldo Colosio.    [Zabludovsky] What has the government done to deal with  these three events: the increased interest rates, the problems  on the emergent markets in general, and the dramatic domestic  situation.    [Aspe] The Salinas administration has done the following:  First, it allowed markets to adjust themselves; by this I mean  the stock market first made a downward adjustment in an orderly  manner. Suffice it to say there were no irregularities in this  considerable adjustment of the first few months of the year;  instead, it was a mature and orderly adjustment.    Second, interest rates were allowed to increase on money  markets, thus raising the interest rates, which had gradually  dropped over the past few months until they were below 9  percent, and then they increased and doubled until they reached  18 percent.    Third, the exchange rate within the range of the agreement  depreciated to the very lowest point of that range, to  approximately 8.5 percent.    Fourth, we activated the so-called lines of reciprocal  support between the central banks of the United States and  Mexico and between the two countries' treasuries for the amount  of $6 billion.    Fifth and sixth, and quite importantly, firm fiscal policies  were maintained. We have a nonfiscal deficit mandate from  Congress and we have held firm to guarantee that in 1994 we will  not have any fiscal deficit whatsoever.    To conclude, the central bank, the now autonomous Bank of  Mexico, has observed a cautious monetary policy; in other words,  it has not resorted to the easy way out. We know how easy and  painful it was in the past to mint bills and to attempt to say  there was no problem. We have handled the situation with a  cautious monetary policy.    It is obvious markets can be adjusted, and that has been our  economic policy. The initial effect is that we have been able  to absorb most of the uncertainty with measures such as these.  As the days go by, we obtain more information and because the  instruments of economic policy are already at work, we can begin  to reverse these phenomena. Thus, the Mexican stock market hit  bottom and then gradually began to rise, with market decisions  and without state intervention. Interest rates, which had  doubled, as I said earlier, are decreasing gradually yet  consistently. We have thus dealt with such negative effects  with an economic policy which exhibits vision, direction,  control and which expresses President Salinas' economic policy.    [Zabludovsky] Will the dollar exchange rate remain within  range, or might there be some trauma?    [Aspe] What we have observed over the past few days is that  the exchange rate went from the lower levels of the range to the  higher levels with a depreciation of approximately 8.5 percent  and remained there for several days. What I have observed over  the past few days is that there has been a slight  (?reevaluation) of the exchange rate. Why? Because we are  distributing the adjustment so that it will not focus solely on  the exchange rate. Partial adjustments must be conducted on  interest rates, fiscal policy, monetary policy, and the exchange  rate; this is why, over the past few days, we have seen an  initial reversal of the trends we observed a week ago.    [Zabludovsky] Do you believe the goals of the agreement  pertaining to inflation and the recovery of Mexico's development  and progress can be maintained? There was talk of 5-percent  inflation. Do you believe that is still a feasible goal?    [Aspe] Of course. Last year, between December 1992 and  December 1993, we had 8-percent inflation. In the agreement, in  fact, we set a goal of 5-percent inflation for this year. I  have already been informed that during the first three months of  1994 -- you, in fact, have disclosed the figures for March -- we  have had an annual inflation rate between March 1993 and March  1994 of 7 percent. This means that we have gone from 8 percent  to 7 percent and that it is obvious that to the extent to which  we adhere to our economic policy, inflation will continue to  decrease, and we will virtually achieve the goal we set for  ourselves in the agreement.    Meanwhile, from the economic recovery standpoint, recovery  began once NAFTA was signed last November. We have seen a  gradual increase in industrial production; it has been gradual,  nothing spectacular, but it has been consistent in December,  January, and February. We must acknowledge these things. When  all the events I described earlier took place and interest rates  jumped, our recovery could have been affected, but to the extent  fiscal and monetary policies are maintained, to the extent we  are able to distribute these negative effects among various  instruments as we have done, to that extent the increase in  interest rates will be temporary, and, therefore, its effects on  our recovery will be passing. Once interest rates return to  their normal level, recovery will continue. I believe we have  seen negative effects, an active economic policy, firmness,  direction and temporary effects, but I believe we will be able  to prevent this from having a permanent effect on recovery.    [Zabludovsky] Can you speak with full confidence in Mexico's  financial and economic future?    [Aspe] The word confidence is something that is obtained  gradually over a span of years. It is obtained by persistence  and consistency. I especially believe confidence is earned not  only during easy times when everything is going well. I believe  President Salinas' economic policy has succeeded at times when  things were not going our way, when there were such negative,  sad, and painful events, such as those at the end of the first  quarter. Nevertheless, the fact we have not made violent  changes, that we have stayed on our course and displayed  consistency and perseverance will earn us the people's  confidence, and in the end will allow the markets to play their  roles and prevent these incidents from doing permanent damage to  the country.</p>

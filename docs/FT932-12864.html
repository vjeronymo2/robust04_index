			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Japanese vehicle output falls 6.2% JAPANESE vehicle production fell by 6.2 per cent in the year to the end of March, the sharpest fall since 1974 when the industry was hit by the deep recession brought on by the rise in world oil prices. The fall, the second consecutive year in which car production has declined, underlines the severity of the decline in Japanese personal consumption in the past year. Car makers played down the significance of a modest pick-up in car production in March, about 0.8 per cent up from the year before. The Japanese Automobile Manufacturers Association says that in spite of the increase in output, new car sales in the first half of April were more than 10 per cent down on last year. Japanese vehicle makers produced 12,334,999 cars, buses and trucks in the year. Domestic sales fell by 7.4 per cent to 6.9m units, while exports fell by 2.9 per cent to about 5.66m vehicles. Passenger car production fell 4.3 per cent at 9.3m units, while truck production was about 12 per cent down at 1.9m. The restructuring forced on car producers by the downturn took another small step forward yesterday when two car producers, Nissan and Isuzu, announced an agreement for Nissan to supply Isuzu with minibuses which would be marketed under Isuzu's name. The spread of the consumer downturn was reflected in an 8.8 per cent fall in department store sales in March from a year before. Sales fell to Y772.5bn (Pounds 4.47bn), the 13th consecutive monthly drop. Excluding an 8.9 per cent fall in March 1990 the decline last month was the sharpest recorded since the department stores association started collecting data in 1965. The economic outlook was further complicated yesterday when three long term credit banks, the Industrial Bank of Japan, Long Term Credit Bank and Nippon Credit Bank, announced a 0.2 percentage point rise in their prime lending rate to 5.1 per cent, which some analysts believe may begin an upward movement in Japanese interest rates.</p>

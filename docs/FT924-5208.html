			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Opec ministers struggle to find output compromise MINISTERS FROM the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries were striving late yesterday to patch together a compromise of their widely disparate views on a production ceiling for the first quarter of next year. Talks were continuing in the evening but positions were hardening as several key players demurred over cutting their levels of oil output. The organisation is aware of the need to give a clear signal to the oil market that it can reintroduce production discipline. Any agreement that falls short of sharing out specific production allocations among individual members is likely to disappoint the market and could further depress prices. The price of North Sea Brent crude for January delivery slipped a further 35 cents yesterday to Dollars 18.77 1/2 a barrel. Opec ministers are having problems getting their sums to add up when the largest producers, Saudi Arabia and Iran, are not prepared to trim their own output from current levels. Iran insists on retaining 3.8m b/d as its production level although many delegates believe its output has been closer to 3.6m b/d. A Gulf official said Iran was 'confused' about what it wanted from the meeting. At the same time, Saudi Arabia is unwilling to produce less than 8.4m b/d. Overall production ceilings still under discussion range from 24.5m to 25m barrels a day, with a consensus building around 24.8m b/d. Output in October was estimated by Opec economists to have been 25.04m b/d in spite of agreement on a much lower ceiling in September. While Saudi Arabia and Iran are finding it hard to agree on a compromise, smaller producers have also approached the meeting in a spirit of defiance. 'Poorer countries are questioning why they should make sacrifices for the benefit of the rich ones,' one delegate said. For this reason, Nigeria and Gabon are pushing for higher output allocations. Mr Ali Ahmad al-Baghli, Kuwait's oil minister, also said the emirate wanted a production level of 1.75m b/d for the first quarter, on which it is not prepared to compromise. This is in line with the emirate's goal of reaching 1.5m b/d by the end of this year as it rebuilds production after the Gulf War. Smaller producers are also carping about the level of fees they pay to the organisation, which are the same as those paid by the larger, richer countries. The debate over membership dues has been brought to a head by Ecuador's request to leave the producers' club. However, ministers have also signalled that they are discussing approaches made by Russia and Kazakhstan to join the organisation. The disaffection felt within the group is likely to prevent a unanimous outcome with the sort of deal that could push up prices. Far more likely is a vague compromise that could hold off a price fall until next year, when ministers hope that an increase in demand because of colder weather could save them from any hard decisions.</p>

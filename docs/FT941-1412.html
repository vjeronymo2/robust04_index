			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Charities warned on politics The Charity Commission yesterday set out a new code of practice incorporating strict standards of behaviour and principles to be observed by charities in political activities and campaigning. The code says publicity material must not be biased and the results of any research commissioned by charities must not be manipulated. The proposed code follows a finding by the commission that Oxfam - Britain's biggest charity - breached restrictions on political activity. Mr Richard Fries, chief charity commissioner, said charities could not be political bodies, but had a right to contribute to public discussion and political debate. This had to be done in a way that reflected their experience and was in line with the objectives of their charitable trust. 'They must, however, exercise great care before engaging in activities of a political nature,' he said. At a news conference to launch the document, he said the guidance aimed to give charities a 'thumb' on what they could and could not do. Challenged on whether this meant an end to poster campaigns naming MPs and how they vote, Mr Fries said the guidance only applied if a charity was thought to be trying to 'apply public pressure' on MPs or the government. Each case had to be examined in its own context. The 20-page document, which is going out for consultation, gives advice on how to stay on the right side of the law. Oxfam, which was consulted in the drawing up of the revised code, said the guidelines were much clearer and more positive about how and when charities could campaign and get involved in political activities.</p>

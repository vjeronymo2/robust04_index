			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 4/4/1994 -- "We have spent 48  hours in Romania and we have noted that you have all the  necessary elements for success. You have a big potential but a  greater support is needed from the part of the Romanians living  abroad, especially in the United States, said the minister of  foreign affairs of El Salvador, Miguel Angel Salaverria, after a  round of talks with the head of the Romanian diplomacy, Teodor  Melescanu, on Monday, April 4.    One of the main theme approached during the talks referred  to  the concrete cooperation in the economic field between the two  countries, said the Romanian minister of foreign affairs, Teodor  Melescanu.    The Romanian party underscored its economic potential in  several fields of interest for El Salvador, especially the  textiles, electric energy, petro-chemistry, and expressed its  readiness to participate, once the issue of the financial  sources is solved, said Melescanu.    In the context, the two parties analysed the idea of opening  a Romanian economic mission in El Salvador.    The two parties debated issues concerning the regional  relations in Eastern Europe as well as in Central America.    A second round of talks between the two foreign ministers is  scheduled for Monday afternoon when an accord is going to be  signed thus canceling the requirement of visas on diplomatic and  service passports. The two ministers will sign also a  memorandum concerning a consultations mechanism to be  established between the two foreign ministries.    The minister of foreign affairs of El Salvador, Miguel Angel  Salaverria, was received on Monday by Romanian President Ion  Iliescu.    The Salvadorean guest conveyed to the Romanian head of state  "a warm message" from the part of Salvadorean President Alfredo  Cristiani, expressing the desire for strengthened cooperation  between El Salvador and Romania.    The Salvadorean dignitary, who is making a several days long  private visit in Romania, was pleasantly impressed by the  contacts he had had here. The democratic future of Romania is  secure, said the Salvadorean minister.    The Salvadorean minister referred also to the future of the  diplomatic relations between the two countries -- a Salvadorean  ambassador for Romania is planned to be based in Rome -- as well  as to the possibilities for joint actions in the economic field  to which Romania could participate with technology while El  Salvador with work force and capital.</p>

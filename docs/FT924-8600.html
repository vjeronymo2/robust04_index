			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / International Company News: Deadline of year for Westpac SENIOR management of Westpac, the troubled Australian bank, was yesterday given a year to solve the bank's problems before facing pressure for changes from institutional shareholders. Mr Ian Salmon, managing director of the AMP Society, Australia's biggest financial institution, said it had been made clear to Westpac management that the bank's operational performance must be improved quickly. 'They will do it in the course of the next six to 12 months or I guess the board will decide they can't do it and make some alternative arrangements,' he said. The AMP is Westpac's biggest shareholder with just under 15 per cent of the stock.</p>

			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Many into one will go: Partnerships to spur UK economic development For the past two months the telephones have been ringing almost non-stop at Kent County Council. Inquiries are pouring in about a radical plan to transform the way publicly funded support for business is delivered within the county. In the first proposal of its kind, the council would merge its Pounds 3.5m-a-year economic development unit - which provides support for business  -with Kent Training and Enterprise Council, one of 82 private sector-led bodies in England and Wales established by the government to improve the nation's skills. This trail-blazing plan would mean the public sector handing over its roles as a promoter of inward investment and physical regeneration to the private sector. The merger, promoted by Sir Alastair Morton, co-chairman of Eurotunnel and chairman of the Tec, is not yet assured, though agreement has been reached in principle and a new chief executive chosen. Tough negotiations on a host of prickly issues remain - such as the extent of elected councillors' influence in setting future economic priorities. While the boldness of Kent's approach has sparked intense interest, it has also highlighted the less vigorous attitude towards partnership between the public and private sectors displayed by many county councils and Tecs. A recent report by Professor Robert Bennett, of the London School of Economics, said Tecs appeared generally to be 'floundering in the field of economic development'. When the government set up the Tecs and 22 Local Enterprise Companies, their Scottish equivalents, in 1991, the aim was to bring greater cohesion in delivering aid to local business. The Tecs, which also administer government training programmes, would establish partnerships with public sector and other local bodies to spearhead a grassroots industrial strategy. So far the achievements are modest, though some Tecs have devised imaginative schemes. Devon and Cornwall, for instance, has set up a West Country Development Corporation, a public-private partnership designed to produce an overview of economic needs. This example is the exception rather than the norm. So what is to be done? 'Some incremental changes are required, learning from the lessons of the first three years,' said Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, which has presented its own shopping list of reforms. Two problems identified by the CBI were: Inflexible and bureaucratic budgets. The government earmarks most of the Tecs' Pounds 2.8bn a year of funding for set programmes involving training the unemployed, stimulating in-company training and fostering economic development. Tecs are unable to tap certain funds if they do not meet the precise terms and conditions of the contract. The budget issue could be addressed over the next few months. Tecs are set to go into battle with the government over funding - and some say they could sustain budget cuts if they had more flexibility. Confusion about the Tecs' mission and role. Several government departments work with Tecs and there have been confused and conflicting messages over priorities. The government has said Tecs should pay more attention to their enterprise role - but such activities only command a small part of their funding. The government may be going some way to addressing this problem. From April, two institutional changes could have a significant impact on Tecs and their role in local economic regeneration. First, 10 Integrated Regional Offices (IROs) are to be created, combining the local departments of environment, transport, employment and trade and industry. The intention is to bring coherence to government programmes at regional level. Second, as part of this change, 20 existing programmes for regeneration and economic development will have their funding pooled within the so-called single regeneration budget, to be administered locally by the 10 IROs. According to Mr David Hunt, employment secretary and the Tecs' main paymaster: 'The old patchwork quilt of initiatives will become, as it were, a seamless duvet at the local level.' For the first time, bodies that traditionally bid for regeneration funds, such as local authorities, will be obliged to involve the private sector - in other words, the Tecs. Mr Hunt said last week: 'We need to see effective local partnerships coming forward to take full advantage of the potential these new developments have for local regeneration. These partnerships will only succeed in winning funding for their initiatives if the private sector is fully involved.' How effective the changes will be in co-ordinating local economic plans remains a moot point. But big opportunities are being offered to those Tecs most able to define their contribution - for instance, how many young people they can retrain to work on a construction project. Demonstrable progress will be slow, however. For while the government trumpets that the total amount of the single regeneration budget in 1994-95 will be Pounds 1.4bn, only Pounds 100m has not yet been allocated. Mr Hunt announced a second big shift by the government, which last week gave the green light to Tecs which want to merge with chambers of commerce. Mergers between the two organisations was one of the main recommendations of Prof Bennett's report. Not only could they result in fewer turf wars over the provision of services, they would also provide Tecs with broader access to the business community. Counties such as Kent could point the third way forward at a time when local government reorganisation is prompting a rethink of many council services. 'The Tec can provide stability at a time of change,' said Sir Alastair Morton. 'Together we can develop quite a formidable development agency.' But are such changes enough to strengthen local economic planning? Mr Amin Rajan, an employment consultant who recently completed a study of Tecs, said: 'The government probably thinks it has done enough to create a climate in which better partnerships can be made. But, there are still question marks over whether that will be sufficient. There is a lot of ground to be covered before all the local players reach agreement on who does what.' The proposed Kent merger, and the fact that Tecs may start to merge with chambers of commerce, indicates a willingness for public and private sector to work more closely together. But the relationships will take time to formulate, and the integration of local economic planning could be frustrated unless the inflexible conditions attached to Tecs' funding are loosened and they acquire more freedom to act where and how they see fit.</p>

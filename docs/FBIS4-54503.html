			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Jiri Leschtina: "The `Dwarf's' Rocket Growth"] </F>   [Text] Vaclav Benda [Christian Democratic Party founder and  first chairman] probably never erred more than when, during the  struggle for leadership of the Christian Democratic Party [KDS],  he called Ivan Pilip a dwarf. Only four months after replacing  Benda as party chairman, 30-year-old Ivan Pilip is the quite  natural successor to outgoing Education Minister Pitha.    Vaclav Klaus will not be overjoyed at the resignation of the  ill minister of education. While involving the prime minister  in philosophical discourses, Petr Pitha, an admirer of [Czech  linguist Vladimir] Smilauer and a Czech history buff, never  disagreed with Klaus on government affairs. Pitha's hitherto  deputy Pilip, on the other hand, has already clashed several  times with the prime minister during debates on the education  concept. And only a few minutes after his election as KDS  chief, Pilip said about Vaclav Klaus: "I do not think that we  have to make any radical concessions to him."    Being a realist, the prime minister realizes that he cannot  deny Ivan Pilip any longer a place in the government, which the  coalition owes the KDS since the times of the "unplaceable"  Vaclav Benda. The prime minister even tried to seize the  initiative and proposed to Pilip that he replace Frantisek Benda  as minister of environment. The circumspect Pilip did not let  himself be lured into the trap, however, and did not enter a  field in which he is not well versed.    The two other chairmen of coalition parties, Jan Kalvoda and  Josef Lux, hope that Ivan Pilip's taking up a ministerial post  will reinforce them. The hitherto fairly successful deputy  minister must, however, first come to terms with the role of  minister and all the intricate problems of the education  department. If any minister wants to take on the prime  minister, even in the political arena, he must have done his  "homework" first. Otherwise he ends up being disgraced, which  would be even more true of a government greenhorn like Pilip.    Whether Pilip's coming to the government, connected with his  greater media presence, will help the Christian Democrats is  highly uncertain. For the time being, it seems that the  ambitious chairman has a better chance of reviving the education  Moloch than of reviving his slender party, which is plunging  irresistibly into the depths of voters' oblivion.</p>

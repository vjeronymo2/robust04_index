He added that it is the United States that led to a stalemate  in the Uruguay Round financial services negotiations. Yim said  Washington threatened to take the exemption from the most  favored nation (MFN) status, an act which is a violation of a  universal principle of the General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade. "The United States declared in the Uruguay Round  negotiations that it will adopt a two-tier approach to deny MFN  status to countries that Washington argues reject full national  treatment and market access to U.S. financial services  companies," Yim said.    If the United States had stuck to the MFN principle, the  multilateral financial services agreement would have been  reached in Geneva last December, Yim said.    In an apparent displeasure over the US trade  representative's  [USTR] comment on Korea and Japan as "free riders" in financial  services, Yim said the purpose of the USTR is to open foreign  markets. Kantor made a special reference to Korea and Japan as  free riders out of attempt to maximize "announcement effect" in  prodding these countries into opening further their financial  markets.    He said it is regrettable for the USTR to complain over the  Korean financial market while the U.S. Treasury Department does  not make any comment.    Korea is one of a few countries where a large number of U.S.  financial firms are operating. As the Korean and Japanese  markets are attractive, the USTR seeks to open their financial  markets wider, he said.    Yim said the USTR is not interested in African countries  where few or no American firms are operating.    Why does the United States complain that Korea is unwilling  to open its financial market at a time when the nation has been  accelerating the implementation of the financial reform plan?  Yim said it is because American firms can find "attractive  business opportunities" here.    Yim acknowledged that Seoul has not accommodated part of the  U.S. requests because some of its proposals are "out of tune  with international practices."    For example, the United States wants American bank branches  here to use head office capital as their branch capital. But  even Germany and France do not accept this request. "As Korea  has no power to inspect head offices of foreign banks here, it  can not check the credit worthiness of each bank. Thus it is  unreasonable for American banks to try to link their head office  capital to Korean operations," he said.    Asked to comment on what action Seoul will take if  Washington  takes a retaliatory step against Korea, Yim said "it is the last  thing we want". But "we do not want a situation where the  United States retains the right to restrict operations of Korean  firms in the United States while American financial firms are  expanding business here."    In the Uruguay Round, "We made it clear that if any country  restricts the overseas activities of Korean financial firms, we  will take a similar reciprocal retaliatory action against the  financial firms from the specific country, Yim said. [no end  quotation mark as published]    If Washington seeks to take an exemption from the MFN  standing to discriminate against specific countries, other GATT  member countries will take similar actions, adding that the  United States will face international criticism for violating  the basic principle of the GATT, Yim said.</p>

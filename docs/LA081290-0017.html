Graffiti Art Expo '90," the Cultural Affairs Department's third annual  graffiti art exhibit and demonstration, will be held Saturday and next Sunday  at the L.A. Photography Center (412 S. Park View St.).  </P> <P> The goal of the event is to promote a positive aspect to street art. Involved  artists will try to encourage kids to stop tagging and vandalizing property and  to direct their talents onto murals.  </P> <P> On view at the free event, which runs from 11 a.m.-5 p.m. both days, will be an  exhibition of graffiti art by the major artists in the field, as well as video  documentaries of past and recent works by various artists.

Louver gallery marks the  first time the artist has exhibited his drawings -- which deal with the removal  and editing process inherent in the making of art -- without a sculptural  accompaniment. The show, which runs through Sept. 8, features drawings for an  upcoming installation at the L.A. County Museum of Art, as well as drawings for  both realized and unrealized new works.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CURRENTS  </P> <P> Pacific Asia Museum has received a $500,000 grant from the W. M. Keck  Foundation, which it will use to purchase adjacent property directly north of  the museum for future expansion, including a new museum wing on the site that  now houses the museum's parking lot. Groundbreaking for the project -- which  will also include renovation of much of the existing museum space -- is set for  1992.  </P> <P> </P> <P> OVERHEARD  </P> <P>  "It's so wonderful to be talking to someone about your work on a professional  basis, because for once, you really are the expert. You have all the answers,  because you did it. It's just a wonderful feeling." -- a casually dressed  female artist, talking to female friend about her recent gallery exhibition.  </P> <P> </P> <P> DEBUTS  </P> <P> Steven Dobbin, a recent graduate of USC's master program, has his first solo  exhibition at Meyers/Bloom gallery in Santa Monica through Sept. 8. Dobbin  creates free-standing mixed-media sculpture dealing with his concerns about  family and domestic issues.  </P> <P> Artist Craig South, who works under the name "Nervous Systems," has his first  one-person show at the downtown American Gallery through Sept. 2. South  combines appropriated images, multiples and installations.  </P> <P> Artist Corey Stein has her first solo exhibition in Los Angeles at Dennis  Anderson Gallery through Sept. 8. Called "Pinched Lilies," the show features  Stein's three-dimensional replicas of condors and vultures which explore the  lay-in-wait attitude.  </P> <P> </P> <P> HAPPENING  </P> <P> "How Can the Arts Community Better Represent Itself?" a free advocacy workshop  addressing topics including California's arts budget, the L.A.

			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Irish principles The fate of the Irish government should not affect the search for a peaceful settlement in Northern Ireland. All coalitions carry the seeds of disunity. The alliance between the traditionally nationalist Fianna Fail and the more modern-minded Labour Party is no exception. Always fractious, it seems, for now, to have ended. Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, spent yesterday in a dramatic and seemingly unsuccessful fight for his political life. The government's fall is, however, a domestic matter, confined to the Irish republic. What is important beyond those borders is that the ceasefire holds, while the perpetrators of violence are drawn into the democratic process. This should be possible whoever is in charge in either Britain or Ireland. The statement by Mr Martin McGuiness of Sinn Fein that a change of government in Dublin would be 'very, very unhelpful indeed' should be rebutted. Sinn Fein, the public face of the IRA, must rid itself of the habit of hinting that it may not be possible to maintain the ceasefire if this or that condition is not met. Such threats are unacceptable if its protestations of peaceful intent are to be taken seriously. That said, no new constitutional settlement for the island of Ireland is likely to last without the backing of Fianna Fail, either as the leading partner in a coalition or in some other role, even if that has to be exercised from the opposition benches. Mr Reynolds, the party's leader, has acknowledged that the claim in the Irish constitution to the six British counties must be rephrased to allow for self-determination by the people of Ulster. All mainstream Irish parties accept this, but an amendment drafted or backed by Fianna Fail would be much surer to pass, than one emanating solely from a government headed by the more anti-republican party, Fine Gael. There lies the rub. Too republican a flavour to any proposed amendment could lead to the rejection of any parallel constitutional package put before the northern electorate. Too unionist a flavour, and Irish nationalists might say No. It should be remembered that the Downing Street declaration, issued jointly by Mr Reynolds and Mr John Major last December, commits both governments to the principle that the right of self-determination must be exercised separately by the electorates of north and south. If the IRA understands that this leaves it nothing to gain by restarting its murderous campaign the declaration will prevail, whatever may happen to its authors. Even when a framework constitutional agreement has been published, the road leading to a general acceptance of its terms, or something like them, is likely to be long. Negotiations in Ireland are rarely speedy. There has never been, nor could or should there be, a guarantee that Mr Reynolds or, for that matter, Mr Major would remain in office long enough to see the process through to its hoped-for conclusion.</p>

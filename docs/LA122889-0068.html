			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLAZA TO HOST HANUKKAH RITES TONIGHT  </P> <P> In celebration of the seventh night of Hanukkah, a large menorah will be lit as  part of a traditional Jewish ceremony tonight at the Buenaventura Plaza in  Ventura.  </P> <P> Rabbi Yakov Latowicz of Chabad, an international Orthodox Jewish organization,  will officiate the candlelight ceremony at 6 p.m. The menorah has been  displayed in the mall since the beginning of Hanukkah on Dec. 22.  </P> <P> The celebration will include dreidel spinning, traditional Jewish food, dancing  and music by an Israeli band. The Hanukkah tradition of dreidel spinning is  taken from Jewish history during the Greek persecution. Children would pretend  to be playing with dreidels -- spinning tops -- to cover up studying the Torah  when soldiers would pass by.  </P> <P> Latowicz, who is from Melbourne, Australia, started the Ventura branch of  Chabad two years ago after moving from Brooklyn with his wife, Sarah. Chabad  offers educational, social and religious services to Jews of all backgrounds  and affiliations. Services are held at the Chabad House, 5850 Thille St.,  Ventura.  </P></p>

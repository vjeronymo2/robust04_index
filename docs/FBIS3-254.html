The party's chief secretary, Dr. Lem Theron, said the reason  for the campaign was the success achieved by the CP during the  past 12 years in establishing a bastion for the political  aspirations of Afrikaners and their desire for freedom and  independence.    The Mulder brothers, members of the Afrikaner Volksfront's  [Afrikaner National Front] negotiating team, say there are no  differences within the Conservative Party about the ideal of an  Afrikaner volkstaat [homeland] and the need to attain such a  state as soon as possible.

			<p><P> August 14, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> $1.3 BILLION IN CLAIMS FILED OVER KILLING BY DEPUTIES  </P> <P> A lawyer for the family of an innocent bystander killed by a sheriff's deputy  three months ago filed $1.3 billion in claims against Los Angeles County on  Monday, saying she hopes the large request will force authorities to end  excessive police force in poor communities.  </P> <P> In a separate development, the Los Angeles FBI office said it opened an  investigation Monday into the May 15 shooting death of Gianna Blue, who was  killed as she shopped at a liquor store on Central Avenue at Century Blvd. on  the edge of Watts.  </P> <P> FBI spokesman Fred Reagan said he could not divulge details of the  investigation, which had been requested by the lawyer for Blue's family, but  acknowledged that paper work to formally begin the probe had arrived Monday  from Washington.  </P> <P> Earlier Monday, the lawyer, Geraldine Green, filed 18 claims against the county  on behalf of Blue's four young children, her parents and siblings, plus the  owner of the liquor store, three employees and another customer.  </P> <P> At a news conference on the steps of the county Hall of Administration, Green  accused the two deputies involved in the incident that led to Blue's death of  disregarding the safety of innocent people and the Sheriff's Department of  frequent and deadly brutalization of residents of poor neighborhoods.  </P> <P> "The citizens of Watts and South Los Angeles are being killed by police," Green  said. "There have been million-dollar claims made before, but apparently  (county officials) just pay that out of petty cash and it's business as usual."  </P> <P> Green said she was referring to recent reports in The Times that showed the  county had paid $8.5 million during a three-year period as a result of  brutality lawsuits against deputies. Most of the victims of excessive force by  the Sheriff's Department are poor, Green contended.  </P> <P> If the county fails to respond to the claims within 45 days or rejects them,  Green said she will she will file suit in federal court.  </P> <P> Sheriff's Deputy Fidel Gonzales said the department would make no statement  about the case because the matter is in litigation. Other county officials  reserved comment, saying they had not seen the claims.  </P> <P> Blue, who had turned 30 the day she was killed, was buying things for her  birthday party, already in progress at her nearby home, when Deputies Shannon  Larren and Thomas Drake ran up to the entrance of the store and fired a volley  of shots at a man they said had a gun.  </P> <P> The deputies, both five-year veterans, told investigators their target was  Hernandez Vincson, 24, who they contended had run from them into the store then  pointed a gun at them. Vincson was shot several times, but survived.  </P> <P> Authorities at first suggested that Vincson shot Blue, but ballistics tests  showed that the fatal bullet came from a deputy's gun, having passed through  Vincson's arm.  </P> <P> In filing the claims, Green cited what she said was the deputies' failure to  identify themselves or shout out a warning to those inside the store before  opening fire.  </P></p>

			<p>Ultra-Vacuum   <F P=102>   94P60169A Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 3 Mar 94 p  5--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY </F>  <F P=103> 94P60169A </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN </F> <F P=105>  Japanese </F> CSO     [Text] The Agency of Industrial Science and Technology's  [AIST] Electrotechnical Laboratory [ETL] announced on 2 March  that it has succeeded for the first time in the world in  obtaining imagery of the spatial distribution of atoms and  molecules existing in microspace inside an ultra-vacuum. This  will make it possible to measure the density of gaseous  molecules in an ultra-vacuum domain. This technology is seen as  useful for the advancement of atomcraft technology which designs  and controls any structural material by manipulating atoms one  by one.    The successful research team was led by Shingo Ichimura,  chief of the surface control section of the laboratory's  ultimate technology department.    The principle of imagery detection is that atoms and  molecules in a vacuum are ionized by a laser and, using an ion  detector, their distribution is investigated. In this  experiment, an attempt was made to detect hydrogen molecules  with a pressure of 1 ten-billionth of atmospheric pressure.    In the experiment, the laser radiation used for ionization  was focused in the vacuum by an optical lens. The distribution  of the ion generation around the laser's focal point was  magnified by an electrostatic laser, consisting of two  electrodes, and reflected onto the top of the ion detector.    The ion generation is at a maximum density at the focus of  the radiation and the ionization rate diminishes in accordance  with the separation from the focal point. For this reason, the  form of the ion generation becomes spindle-shaped, having a  maximum diameter in the vicinity of the focal point. In this  experiment, the ionization domain's maximum diameter was about  50 microns.    Previously, the ETL also ionized molecules and atoms by  using  a laser and is establishing atom counting technology which can  count ionized gaseous molecules and atoms, one by one. The ETL,  combining the current space measurement technologies, has opened  the way for measuring molecular density inside an ultra-high  vacuum.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] After a heated debate and a few amendments to the  original text, the Constituent Congress on 20 December  unanimously approved the Defense and Internal Order Committee's  resolution creating the National Registry of Detainees,  Defendants, and Inmates [Registro Nacional de Detenidos,  Procesados, y Recluidos].    The resolution -- based on a draft bill submitted by  legislator Pedro Garcia Saavedra (NM-C90 [Change 90-New Majority  Faction]) -- is divided into seven articles and three final and  transitory clauses.    The first article establishes that the registry will have an  updated data base that will make it possible to identify and  place the people arrested by Armed Forces and National Police  members and by court order.    Moreover, it is intended to adequately accompany all the  steps of the legal process involving people subject to judicial  investigation, including their imprisonment.    The resolution states that the Attorney General's Office,  which will be in charge of appointing the registry's executive  director, is charged with organizing and administrating the  registry.    The second article states that the Interior and Defense  Ministries, the Judicial Branch, and the National Prisons  Institute will supply all the information required by the  registry regarding detentions, investigations, and imprisonments.    The third article states that any individual or institution  has free access to the information contained in the registry.    According to the approved text, a coordinating committee of  the registry also is created. This committee will comprise two  representatives from the Attorney General's Office -- one of  whom will preside over the committee, and one representative  each from the Justice, Interior, and Defense Ministries.    The committee also will include a representative from the  judicial branch and from the congressional Human Rights  Committee.    In its first transitory clause, the document states that the  first stage of the registry will include information on  individuals arrested on charges of terrorism and treason against  the fatherland, the state, and the national defense.    Finally, it is stated that the guidelines contained in the  letter of understanding signed on 23 January 1992 by the  Attorney General's Office, the Interior Ministry, AID, and the  Latin American Institute for Crime Prevention and Treatment of  Offenders will be followed in creating the registry.</p>

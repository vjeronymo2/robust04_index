			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Uncertainty in Nepal election Nepalis voted yesterday to choose a new parliament amid scattered violence and anxieties that no clear majority would emerge to guide the new Himalayan democracy out of poverty. Despite the deployment of more than 100,000 members of the security forces, at least 13 people were injured in clashes between supporters of rival parties, police and local officials said. More than 1,250 election observers, including 130 foreigners from 28 countries, were posted in 205 constituencies for the kingdom's second general election since pro-democracy protests ended an absolute monarchy in 1990. In 1991 the centrist Nepali Congress party won the country's first free elections in 31 years after King Birendra was forced to relinquish almost all of his power. But factional infighting and corruption allegations plagued the ruling party, forcing Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala to call parliamentary polls 18 months ahead of schedule. A total of 12.3m people were eligible to vote. No idea of the outcome was expected before Friday. Political observers were split over whether the Congress party, which held 114 of 205 seats in the outgoing parliament, would overcome internal wrangling to retain a majority.</p>

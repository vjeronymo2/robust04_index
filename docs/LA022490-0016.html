			<p><P> February 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH AFRICA FREES MANDELA  </P> <P> On Feb. 11, a small bright spot appeared in the dark, gaping abyss called  "White South Africa." A time to rejoice, yes, but it is also a time for a new  beginning for the 23 million freedom fighters to attain what every living  person should have: a right to stand up and be counted, to speak and resist  freely.  </P> <P> Contrary to Ronald Reagan's belief of the Soviet Union, white South Africa is  the real "evil empire"; and it is still in power, still very lethal. What  happens in South Africa affects South Africans most, but it also affects the  entire world, economically and spiritually. In the words of our own Nelson  Mandela, Dr. Martin Luther King: "An injustice to someone, somewhere, is an  injustice to everyone, everywhere."  </P> <P> JIM MUDGE  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

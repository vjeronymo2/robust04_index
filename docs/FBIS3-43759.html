			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Marcolino Moco today granted an  audience to Cuban Foreign Affairs Minister Roberto Robaina. The  two officials discussed the need for strengthening the ties that  have linked Angola and Cuba for several decades. Cuban Foreign  Minister Robaina is visiting this country within the framework  of a diplomatic offensive which his government launched a few  months ago. The Cuban official noted that it is not enough that  the two peoples should know and understand each other, adding  that they must also seek to cooperate as advantageously as  possible. The audience was also attended by Angolan Foreign  Affairs Minister Venancio de Moura and the Cuban ambassador to  Angola.    Official bilateral talks began this afternoon. Roberto  Robaina, who arrived in the Angolan capital this morning on his  first official visit to this country in his capacity as Cuban  foreign affairs minister, had already carried out part of his  program before midday: He held a private meeting with Venancio  de Moura, his Angolan counterpart and he visited the Cuban  doctors at the Military Hospital. He and his team began  official talks with their Angolan counterparts at the Foreign  Affairs Ministry this afternoon. They discussed the internal  situation in Angola and Cuba, bilateral friendship and  cooperation ties, and the international situation but, before  doing so, they delivered long speeches. Angolan Foreign Minister  Venancio de Moura spoke first:    [Begin Moura recording] After the talks we had this morning  concerning the internal situation in our countries, we found we  are motivated to do everything in our power to ensure that we  continue working together to overcome the insufficiencies and  difficulties our peoples and governments are facing at this  stage. Those difficulties have often arisen from hostile  behavior toward our countries. [end recording]    In turn, the Cuban foreign affairs minister attached special  significance to his diplomatic offensive in Africa, where he is  on a tour of several countries. Minister Robaina noted that this  was particularly the case in the context of the very complex and  constantly changing world we live in. He added that in Cuba one  cannot talk about a diplomatic offensive without mentioning  Africa, a continent with which Cuba has long standing historic  relations.    [Begin Robaina recording] To my country -- and, I suppose,  to  Angola, too -- diplomacy at this stage means finding paths,  opening doors, and finding solutions to our problems. We must  seek advantageous cooperation and think along the lines that  what might be a necessity to one side, might also be an  opportunity for the other side to [word indistinct]. [end  recording]    Cuban Foreign Affairs Minister Roberto Robaina is expected  to  wind up his visit to Angola tomorrow. Among other commitments,  he is scheduled to call on President of the Republic Jose  Eduardo dos Santos.</p>

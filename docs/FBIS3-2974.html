"Father is in excellent health. He has a very good appetite  and walks three kilometers every day -- longer sometimes," said  Deng Nan today when she, as vice-minister of the State Science  and Technology Commission, was on her way to solicit opinions  from deputies to the National People's Congress (NPC) now in  session here.    When asked whether her father still likes swimming, Deng Nan  said: "Father loves swimming in the sea; he never swims in a  swimming pool."    The senior leader is following closely the progress of the  ongoing sessions of the NPC and the National Committee of the  Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, according to  Deng Nan.    "Father certainly knows what is going on. Every day, he  reads newspapers, watches TV, and is very much concerned about  domestic and international affairs," the daughter said.    In response to a reporter's concern that Deng Xiaoping  seemed  thinner when he appeared on TV during the Spring Festival, Deng  Nan said: "It's good to be thin. Haven't you heard of the  Chinese saying `a thousand taels of gold cannot buy thinness in  one's old age'?"    Asked whether Deng Xiaoping will again spend the Spring  Festival in Shanghai, Deng Nan said: "I think he will. He has  also said that he will spend a Spring Festival in Hong Kong  after 1997."</p>

			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Survey of European Finance and Investment - Portugal (5): Big portfolio clean-up ahead - Insurance industry As they gear up for the single European market, Portugal's insurance companies have understood that they can no longer rely on profits from financial investments while neglecting their real business, which is selling insurance policies. However, adjustments have only just begun, and the real cleaning up of portfolios and companies has been left for this year. Despite the current recession, provisional results indicate that for insurers 1993 was less bleak than the previous year. But results are still a far cry from what the companies would have wished for. According to an estimate by the Association of Portuguese Insurers (APS), the sector sold about Es530bn worth of premiums in 1993. This means it still grew by 22.2 per cent and, if the drop in inflation is taken into account, the real increase was about 24.6 per cent. Car and work accident insurances, which represent about half of all premiums, remain the Achilles heel of the market. But judging by last year's development, the car division should soon see better days. APS estimates that companies managed to cut losses to about Es10.5bn in 1993, half of 1992's total. Things look gloomier in work accidents, where losses may have been as high as Es11.5bn, some Es3bn more than a year before. Following an embittered war for market shares, which led to disastrous 1992 results, Portuguese insurance companies finally began introducing reforms in 1993. The process is likely to be intensified in 1994. Analysts warn that decision-making in many companies is still guided by faith and inertia and that growth at any cost but at the expense of profitability and solidity remained the main tendency in 1993. This view is not shared, however, by Mr Ruy de Carvalho, president of the APS. He points out that the very reason why many companies registered only little growth last year was exactly because they began cleaning up their portfolios, adjusting their risk policy, and adapting prices to Portuguese reality. As a result and because of the introduction of a new invalidity chart, tariffs for work accident insurances are expected to increase by 20 per cent or more this year. In the car sector, prices are expected to rise by about 15 per cent. The development in life insurances, which account for 31.5 per cent of premiums, followed two different paths. Individual insurances saw growth increase from 24.4 per cent in 1992 to 38 per cent last year. In voluntary group life insurances, on the other hand, the recession resulted in a severe reduction of growth, from 61.3 per cent in 1992 to 18.7 per cent. There is disagreement among Portuguese companies whether there will be increased competition from companies not yet established in Portugal once the single European market for the insurance sector comes into effect in July, when the third generation directives granting full freedom to offer services are applied. Some companies say that little will change because the main international companies are already operating here. Others think the new directives could lead to considerable losses for Portuguese companies. Mr de Carvalho says the Portuguese market is well prepared from a legal point of view. But things look different in practice: 'Portuguese companies, even the big ones, are medium-sized in European terms. This shows how difficult it is for us to compete successfully in a market that will be extremely open.' Mr de Carvalho believes that companies will have to improve their technical skills or call in outside specialists. He also thinks that big transformations will take place among the many small companies with a market quota of less than 1 per cent. Mr de Carvalho expects mergers and what he calls 'a passive internationalisation'; that is, companies opening up their capital to foreign companies. While raising tariffs, insurance companies are also trying to improve services and reduce costs. According to APS, Portuguese insurance companies invested about Es7bn in computerisation in 1992 (figures for 1993 are not yet available) and may have reduced their staff by 5 per cent in 1993. Due to expensive settlements for early retirement and redundancy payments, the effects of these efforts have not yet made their mark on the accounts. But they are seen as an investment in the future. General expenses are still very high, considering that they represent 25 per cent of premiums sold - about twice the EU-average. A working group comprising representatives of the finance ministry, insurance companies, banks, the stock market and investment funds discussed for two years the problems of Portugal's financial sector. While the resulting white paper for the banking sector has already been published, insurance companies are still awaiting publication of the section on their business. Parts of it have been leaked to the press, but due to an agreement to remain silent, companies are reluctant to comment on it. The 'livro branco' - basically a code of conduct for Portuguese insurance companies in the large EU-market - contains an analysis of the Portuguese market and its capacity to modernise, as well as chapters on subjects such as pension funds, supervision and tax regulations. One thorny matter that remains to be resolved is that of health insurance. For many companies, this area is littered with potential problems. Health insurance currently accounts for only 2.6 per cent of premiums and is loss-making. A government proposal for a new scheme, which was to provide an alternative to its national health service, has found little or no favour with insurers. From the very beginning, companies objected to the government's idea of exclusiveness, saying that in a country such as Portugal only a complementary scheme could work; a combination of private and public health insurance. APS says those with high incomes might well opt for private health insurance only, but that such a solution should not be imposed by law. Another concern is that because costs in the health sector are soaring, only companies should be allowed to establish the prices for such insurances. Finally, the market opposes life-long policies. Mr de Carvalho concedes that the government has moved closer to the insurers' views. He adds that the sector is now hoping for even more sympathy from the new health minister, Mr Paulo Mendo, who took office last December. 'We are very interested in finding a good solution', he says. 'But insurance companies cannot accept a scheme which will lead to exactly the same problems the national health service is suffering. We do not have a state budget behind us, nor can we rely on the other EU countries for financial help.'</p>

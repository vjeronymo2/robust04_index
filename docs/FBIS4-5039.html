			<p>BFN     [Text] The two suspects and a lookout in the assassination  of Leopoldo Mabilangan, alias Comrade Hector, and his bodyguard  have already been identified. However, PNP [Philippine National  Police] ReCom [Regional Command] IV Chief Romeo Odi refused to  disclose the names of the three. The three are now the subject  of an extensive manhunt called Task Force Comrade Hector.    The first gunman is 5 feet and 6 inches tall, weighs 135  pounds, slim-built, around 20 years old and of brown complexion.  According to witnesses, the first gunman approached and shot  Comrade Hector between the eyes. When he fell, the second  gunman approached and shot Comrade Hector in the face and the  body to make sure that he was dead.    The second gunman is a mestizo, stands 5 feet and 7 inches,  is between 28 and 33 years old, and is of medium-build. He is  believed to be the leader of the group. The lookout, who also  served as the back-up, is also of medium-build and is 5 feet 7  inches tall, of fair complexion, and 25 to 30 years old.    Meantime, ReCom IV confirms that the murder of Comrade  Hector  was decided by the Southern Tagalog Regional Committee of the  New People's Army [NPA]. According to Superintendent Victor  Tiangco, five former followers of Comrade Hector descended the  mountain to warn him of the assassination plan.    [Begin Tiangco recording in English; monitored in progress]  ...our investigation leads to Comrade Roger's group and we have  witnesses and statements by reliable sources that this is the  handiwork of Comrade Roger of the CPP (Communist Party of the  Philippines)-NPA, because one week before the actual ambush of  Comrade Hector, a group of NPA's loyal to Mabilangan went to his  residence and warned him of the assassination to be carried out  by expert assassins led by Comrade Rex and Comrade Carlo. [end  recording]    In a related development, the possible motive for murdering  Mabilangan is alleged to be related to his livelihood projects.  According to the NBI [National Bureau of Investigation], many  rebels surrendered to join Comrade Hector's projects, which  grossly reduced the ranks of the NPA, especially the Banahaw  Command, formerly led by Comrade Hector.    President Ramos assured the family of Comrade Hector that  the  government would do its best to arrest his assassins. The  president likewise called Comrade Hector a hero because he  risked his life when he surrendered and decided to help the  government. The president likewise issued a directive to study  the possibility of putting rebel surrenderees under the witness  protection program or granting them security.</p>

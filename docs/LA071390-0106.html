			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Dice Film May Stink but Box Office Is Rosy: Activists Against Sexist Pigs, a  group that condemns Andrew Dice Clay as sexist and homophobic, said that it  left a stink bomb in a Westwood theater as its opening night "review" of Clay's  new film, "The Adventures of Ford Fairlane." A spokesperson for the group said  that a foul-smelling device was left in the Westwood Odeon Cinema during the  10:15 showing.  </P> <P> Witnesses reported that a smell of rotten eggs and human waste hung around the  theater well after midnight. But police and executives for the film's  producers, 20th Century Fox, said that they could not confirm the claim. Fox  executives, however, were doing anything but holding their noses at the film's  opening-day figures. They said that "Ford Fairlane" brought in more than $2  million Wednesday on 1,201 screens nationwide, for a per-screen average of  $1,708. "It's Christmas again," declared Tom Sherak, president of marketing and  distribution for Fox. "It was an exceptional opening and exceeded our wildest  expections." GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

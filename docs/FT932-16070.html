			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper at lowest point since 1988 COPPER, THE one London Metal Exchange-traded metal to have remained buoyant despite recession in most of the world's industrialised countries, came under severe selling pressure yesterday and the price in US dollar terms dropped to its lowest point since June, 1988. The price of copper for delivery in three months dropped by Dollars 52 a tonne to close in London at Dollars 2,090, some Dollars 300 below the Dollars 2,400 peak it reached earlier this year. Mr William Adams, analyst at Rudolf Wolff, part of the Noranda natural resources group, said there was a substantial volume of selling from the Far East and by China yesterday which forced the copper price down through the psychologically-important Dollars 2,100 a tonne level. 'However, with the US economic recovery still looking strong, it is difficult to get too bearish,' he added. Mr Adams pointed out that LME option declarations are due today so 'the markets are expected to be volatile.' Mr Neil Buxton, analyst at Metal Bulletin Research, said copper 'has been defying economic gravity since the recession started and has the greatest potential of all the metals to fall.' He pointed out that every time the price seemed likely to fall some interruption to supply or Chinese buying came to the rescue. 'Will it be rescued again? It appears unlikely. Stocks are rising, there are no supply problems. We could see quite a sharp fall in price.' However, Mr Buxton said that as long as the price did not fall below 90 cents a lb, compared with 95 cents last night, the copper industry would go on making profits. Copper is still quoted in sterling on the LME and three-month metal fell by another Pounds 14.75 a tonne yesterday to close at Pounds 1,400.75. In first two days this week the price has fallen by Pounds 35.25 a tonne, or by nearly 2.5 per cent.  ------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Monday's close) tonnes  ------------------------------------- Aluminium    +18,100  to 1,754,425 Copper       +3,675   to 365,800 Lead         -450     to 246,025 Nickel       +438     to 88,050 Zinc         +1,475   to 602,650 Tin          +475     to 19,645  -------------------------------------</p>

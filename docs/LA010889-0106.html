			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> L.A. WORKS TO SAVE TROUBLESOME TREES IN WOODLAND HILLS  </P> <P> In a switch from what happened the last time tree roots damaged a street in  Woodland Hills, officials are taking concrete steps to save hundreds of trees  that have buckled pavement in the community's oldest neighborhood.  </P> <P> Los Angeles city street maintenance crews are cutting out and replacing damaged  curbs and gutters -- not cutting down the 65-year-old eucalyptus and pepper  trees whose roots have caused cracks and buckling on 10 streets.  </P> <P> The streets are in Woodland Hills' original 1923 Giraud subdivision south of  Ventura Boulevard. The neighborhood is half a mile from where state highway  workers caused a furor eight months ago by chopping down trees that were  beginning to crack sidewalks.  </P> <P> State workers removed 25 ash trees along Topanga Canyon Boulevard near Warner  Center Park in May before a public outcry forced them to stop. Department of  Transportation officials later apologized and told nearby homeowners that the  trees could be replaced.  </P> <P> But Caltrans administrators continue to back their policy of removing  troublesome trees.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cannot Afford Repairs  </P> <P> In subsequent meetings with Woodland Hills residents, state officials -- who  have jurisdiction over Topanga Canyon Boulevard because it is a state highway  -- said they cannot afford to make repeated repairs to tree-damaged pavement.  </P> <P> James L. McCullough, the senior Caltrans maintenance engineer who authorized  the tree removal in May, said other trees along Topanga Canyon Boulevard are  beginning to damage pavement. He said the state will give adjacent property  owners a chance to save the trees by assuming responsibility for them before  Caltrans resorts to the chain saw.  </P> <P> "It is not a dislike for trees that makes us do this," McCullough said. He  added that Caltrans' limited highway-repair budget precludes spending money on  trees.  </P> <P> City street maintenance administrators said their policy is different.  </P> <P> "We do whatever we can to save trees," said Bob Kennedy, street tree  superintendent for the city's Bureau of Street Maintenance. "It's easy to cut  the tree down and eliminate the problem, but we don't take that posture."  </P> <P> In Woodland Hills, city tree experts have carefully cut away roots that are  damaging the pavement. Then they have pruned the tallest trees to keep them  from toppling over because of a lack of root support.  </P> <P> Kennedy said the city in recent years has increased inspections of the 680,000  trees that line Los Angeles' streets. It has also increased tree trimming in  hopes of keeping top-heavy trees from blowing over in storms.  </P> <P> In 1983, when the city scheduled pruning of all street trees over a 16-year  cycle, about 300 trees were uprooted by one storm, Kennedy said Friday. The  city now tries to trim all trees every six years or so. As a result, only 20  street trees were lost when a major windstorm struck Los Angeles two months  ago, he said.  </P> <P> Dennis Weber, street maintenance supervisor in charge of the Woodland Hills  repair project, said workers are installing new gutters along 2.3 miles of  roadway bordered by Providencia and Crespi streets and Don Pio and San  Feliciano drives.  </P> <P> Each curb-side tree in the area is being inspected by city arborists after the  old gutters, curbing and pavement have been removed and the roots have been  exposed, he said.  </P> <P> Only two aging eucalyptus trees have been found to have rotted roots that put  them in danger of falling over after the root system had been trimmed to make  way for the new paving. After city workers consulted homeowners near the trees,  officials said, the trees were reluctantly removed.  </P> <P> "I'm happy to see trees saved," Weber said Friday. "This place would look kind  of desolate without them."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Replacing Curbing  </P> <P> Although new concrete gutters are being installed along all 10 streets, only  the most seriously damaged curbing -- sections with broken concrete that could  cause tire blowouts -- is being replaced, he said.  </P> <P> The project is costing about $440,000, said Neil Spiva, chief projects  coordinator for the Bureau of Street Maintenance.  </P> <P> The work will take another two months to finish. But it has already drawn  praise from Woodland Hills residents who had decried May's tree-chopping by  Caltrans.  </P> <P> "I'd rather save the trees than the sidewalks," said Doug McClung, who is one  of the neighborhood's oldest residents. He built his home on Martinez Street in  1948, when there were only a few houses in the Giraud subdivision.  </P> <P> Giraud's eucalyptus and peppertrees were mature giants even then, McClung said.  By the '40s, Giraud's original development company had gone broke and the name  of the entire 4,000-resident community had been changed from Giraud to Woodland  Hills because of the trees.  </P> <P> McClung said he has teased the city street repair crew that is working in his  neighborhood by showing them a 1929 photo that depicts nearby Dumetz Road being  graded by workers using a team of four mules.  </P> <P> Gordon Murley, president of the Woodland Hills Homeowners Organization, also  applauded the city's tree-saving efforts. He said the city's street-tree  maintenance staff has begun to work with homeowners after being involved in a  tree-pruning controversy a few years ago.  </P> <P> "I'd have to say that Mr. Kennedy is less a bureaucrat and more sympathetic  than most people in the city we deal with," said Murley, who bitterly clashed  with Caltrans over the Topanga Canyon Boulevard chopping incident. "People are  finally coming to realize that to denude a neighborhood has no value."  </P></p>

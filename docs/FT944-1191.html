			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Zimbabwe's flower exports take to the sky - The country's growers are now the EU's fourth largest suppliers When the Danckwerts, a prominent Zimbabwe farming family, decided to grow flowers for export to northern Europe, they were warned it would be a flop. Less than 10 years later, they are leaders in a blossoming industry that is flying out over 7,000 tonnes of cut flowers to brighten the northern winter each year, bringing the country ZDollars 290m (Pounds 22m) in annual export earnings. 'This sort of thing is ideal for Zimbabwe,' says Rijk Danckwerts, who farms 1,600 hectares next to Harare airport with his brother Craig. Using a combination of reliable sunshine, artificial light and black plastic coverings to force flowering, they can produce 12 flushes from a plant in one season and fly flowers out every day between October and early June. 'That's important to buyers,' he says. The flower business, which now accounts for at least half the two farms' annual turnover of ZDollars 12m, is a truly international one. The varieties the Danckwerts use are bred in Israel, grown in Zimbabwe and sold directly to supermarkets such as Sainsbury in the UK, or via the Dutch auctions to destinations as distant as Japan or Canada. Zimbabwe is now the fourth largest exporter of flowers to the European Union. The industry took off when white tobacco farmers decided to diversify, fearing the strength of the anti-smoking lobby in the west. Low international prices last year meant a fall in plantings of tobacco, Zimbabwe's biggest agricultural export, leading to a 22 per cent smaller harvest this year. Moreover, the World Bank predicts that tobacco prices will remain close to the 1993 level over the next few years and then fall in real terms by about 10 per cent over the following decade. Another reason for moving into flowers was concern about the government's moves to redistribute white-farmed land to black Zimbabweans to relieve population pressures and provide homes for those displaced by the war that led to independence in 1980. Flower production has enabled white farmers to maintain or increase their incomes by using small areas of land intensively. The Danckwerts produce their flowers from 9.5 hectares of greenhouses. As well as the climatic advantage, the industry enjoys very low labour costs compared with northern hemisphere flower-producing countries. Horticulture is also one of the few sectors in Zimbabwe that has never been subject to state marketing controls. The Danckwerts began by growing summer flowers such as delphiniums, but moved into higher value roses when the Zimbabwe dollar lost value and airfreight costs soared. Roses are the most typical Zimbabwean product, but the brothers switched again, this time into asters, when roses became common and prices fell. 'We didn't want to follow the trend too closely,' says Rijk Danckwerts, pointing out that Kenya, Tanzania and Zimbabwe will produce 200m to 300m more roses between them this year than last. Roses also require ultra-cautious handling. 'You only have to look at a rose and something goes wrong.' By specialising, he is able to boast that the white aster variety produced by the family company, Sunshine Flowers, is grown nowhere else in the southern hemisphere. The asters, grown at 35'C, are picked and sorted, then transferred to cold storage at 4'C. From there, it is only 10 minutes to the airport, where they are dispatched to Europe. The industry is not free of troubles. The economic structural adjustment programme introduced in 1991 has pushed up interest rates to 35 or 40 per cent. This makes it difficult for new farmers to enter production and for existing ones to expand, especially given the shift to high-value flowers requiring hefty capital investment. Nevertheless, a few black farmers are managing to work their way in. Airfreight tariffs are among the highest in the world, accounting for 40-65 per cent of the cost, insurance and freight value of the flowers. The national cargo line, Affretair, enjoys state protection against competition and the unreliability of its schedules poses serious problems for producers of short-life commodities. Despite this, the flower industry, together with the productive fruit and vegetable sector, is being encouraged by the government because it is highly labour intensive - employing about 30 people, mostly women, per hectare - and because of its high returns. Mr Stanley Heri, chief executive of the Horticulture Promotion Council, points out that horticulture can produce the same turnover from one hectare as 20 hectares of maize. Export earnings from horticulture are already the fourth highest among agricultural products, after tobacco, beef and sugar. 'Horticulture will overtake tobacco within 10 years,' Mr Heri says confidently. Given that the west European cut flower market is expected to grow from Dollars 12.5bn in 1990 to more than Dollars 19bn by 2000, he may well be on to something.</p>

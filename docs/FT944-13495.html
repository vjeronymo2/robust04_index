			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / UK Company News: New owner seeks to revitalise Sock Shop Sock Shop, the 1980s retailing phenomenon which collapsed four years ago, could come back to the market following its sale yesterday to Sheffield entrepreneur Mr Stephen Hinchliffe. Mr Hinchliffe has spent the two years since his abrupt departure from quoted companies James Wilkes and Lynx Holdings building up a group of retail businesses. In August his latest company, Salisbury Stores, acquired the lossmaking Salisbury luggage chain from Signet, the jewellery group formerly known as Ratners, for Pounds 3.18m. Salisbury Stores is buying Sock Shop from Murray Johnstone, the Scottish financial group, in return for a convertible equity stake believed to be about 10 per cent. The purchase will create a private retailing group with sales of more than Pounds 100m. Mr Hinchliffe said Salisbury aimed to come to the market in about two or three years when 'market conditions are right and when our performance is good enough to give some credibility'. Sock Shop is believed to be breaking even on sales of about Pounds 30m. It collapsed three years after flotation following an ill-fated expansion into the US. It was bought by a management team backed by Murray Johnstone, which eventually controlled the group. Mr David MacLellan of Murray Johnstone will join the Salisbury Stores board. Mr Hinchliffe said he expected to broaden the products on offer at Sock Shop, introducing accessories and gifts. The enlarged business would enjoy 'significant merger benefits, including cross-fertilising merchandise', he said. In September Mr Hinchliffe separately acquired the Colibri cigarette lighters business.</p>

			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / International Company News: Black wins approval for 25% Fairfax stake THE Australian government yesterday said it would allow The Telegraph, Mr Conrad Black's British newspaper group, to increase its stake in the John Fairfax media group from 15 per cent to 25 per cent. Fairfax shares rose 10 cents to close at ADollars 2.09 on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) after the Labor cabinet decided to ignore criticism from across the political spectrum of Mr Black's request. Mr John Dawkins, the federal treasurer (finance minister), said the decision reflected 'the valid need of foreign investors to safeguard their financial and managerial commitment to their newspapers'. Mr Dawkins said other foreign investors would be allowed to own a further 5 per cent of Fairfax, enabling Hellman &amp; Friedman, the US investment bank, to retain its 5 per cent non-voting shareholding. Mr Dan Colson, deputy chairman of The Telegraph, welcomed the decision: 'Obviously we are delighted, and we are looking forward to increasing our involvement with this great company.' Officials said the government hoped the decision would help to stabilise the ownership of Fairfax, which was in receivership from 1990 to 1991 after a bungled buy-out of family shareholders. However, the higher ceiling on foreign ownership offers The Telegraph no protection from Mr Kerry Packer, the Australian media entrepreneur who owns 10 per cent of Fairfax and is rumoured to be considering a full bid. Mr Packer could acquire control by buying a further 41 per cent of Fairfax, but he would have to relinquish control of the Channel Nine television network to comply with cross-media ownership regulations. Trying to disarm criticism of Mr Black's involvement in Fairfax, Mr Dawkins said there would be no further increases in the level of foreign investment allowed in newspapers. However, the Friends of Fairfax, an umbrella grouping of journalists and supporters, said the decision was a 'sell-out' which would leave the bulk of the Australian media in foreign hands. Fairfax, which publishes the Sydney Morning Herald, The (Melbourne) Age and the Australian Financial Review, is the main competitor to News Corporation, the US media group, which controls 70 per cent of Australia's daily circulation. The decision was also criticised by Labor MPs, including Mr Barry Jones, the party's federal president. Mr John Hewson, the conservative leader, said it was 'quite shabby'. The populist Australian Democrats said it was 'grossly irresponsible'. Mr Black acquired management control of Fairfax in 1991, when the group was bought from the receiver for ADollars 1.4bn (USDollars 1bn) by the Tourang consortium, consisting of The Telegraph and Hellman &amp; Friedman. The Telegraph's shareholding was reduced to 15 per cent following a flotation in 1992. The remaining shares are owned by a range of Australian investors, mostly financial institutions. Mr Dawkins said the revised limit on Fairfax shareholdings would apply to all newspaper publishers, effectively raising the ceiling on overseas shareholdings from 20 to 30 per cent. The decision opens the way for Mr Tony O'Reilly's Dublin-based Independent Newspapers (INP) to increase its 20 per cent stake in Australian Provincial Newspapers (APN), a leading rural publisher.</p>

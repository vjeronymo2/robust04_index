			<p><P> August 3, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AUTO MAKERS AND POLLUTION BURDEN  </P> <P> Martin and Kathleen Feldstein's column "Environmental Purity Can Cost Too Much"  (Op-Ed Page, July 23) failed to take into account the fact that if we do not  clean up our pollution problems quickly we will have no need for the  educational and housing programs to which they feel environmental funding  should be diverted. We will be building our homes on landfills and educating  our children in glass houses to protect them from the toxic waste if the  government and the people of our communities do not act.  </P> <P> A point was made that for reductions in the annual sulfur dioxide emissions  from 20 million tons per year to 15 million tons in 6 years would cost $700  million, a price the Feldsteins felt was too high. To eliminate an additional 5  million tons by the year 2000 might cost five times as much. Maybe we should  focus our attention on the overfunded defense budget and the necessity for the  120 B-2s the military would like to have. The price tag on one B-2 was over a  half-billion dollars. How about making a few less in the name of cleaning up  the environment?  </P> <P> KELLY A. LOPEZ  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

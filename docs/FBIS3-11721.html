			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Galo Abril, planning secretary for the </F> National Council on Development, by Teresa Herrera; place and  date not given]    [Text] The government expressed its optimism by  guaranteeing Ecuadorans that 1994 will be "a very good year."  Because of this the adoption of new economic measures was put  aside, except for those still pending from 1993, such as an  increase in the price of gas for domestic use and in telephone  rates.    Nevertheless, other matters remain to be settled that  involve  the modernization of the state and privatization of its  enterprises, the promulgation of new laws and regulations, and  the announcement on the minimum salary of 66,000 sucres per  month, that has not been changed since 1993.    "If there is not another decrease in the price of petroleum,  or a landslide, or washouts, or floods, if these things do not  happen, I would guarantee Ecuadoran society, Ecuador in general,  that we will have a very good year in 1994," said Galo Abril,  planning secretary for the National council on Development  (CONADE).    Abril stated today in declarations to HOY that negotiations  are under way with the IMF for "economic rehabilitation that  will raise Ecuador's prestige in the eyes of international  agencies, such as the commercial banks, among others."  <H5>  The Interview </H5>   The following is the interview of the planning secretary by  this newspaper:    [Herrera] What are the prospects for this year?    [Abril] The fall in the price of crude on the international  market caused a budget deficit that was bridged by the latest  increase in gasoline prices, so that the goal of inflation of  about 20 percent calculated for this year is being attained; we  believe that economic growth initially forecast at three percent  will be about 2.5 percent due to a drop in public investment;  and in the foreign sector we estimate that there will be good  progress in the balance of payments and therefore maintenance,  with a slight increase, of international monetary reserves. That  is to say, the originally planned goals will be reached,  economic growth will be less than 3 percent, but not  dramatically so.    [Herrera] Will the new prospects affect public investment?    [Abril] In the process of compensating for the decline in  the  price of petroleum, the government has tried to preserve those  investments in infrastructure that support production, such as  highways, local roads, irrigation systems, drainage, and others,  that are fundamental for farming in particular and for the  agricultural sector to be able to bring their products to  market. It will try to improve their production with the purpose  of encouraging employment in two ways: directly, with employees  engaged in infrastructural projects, and by greater production  through support to private activity.    These projects have great importance, in their turn, in all  branches of the construction sector, in material supply  activities as well as in lumber and metal manufacturing, among  others.    In housing, the 1994 program exceeds 20,000 units, which in  itself means job creation. Therefore, if spending is used  rationally to improve the infrastructure--although there may be  a small reduction in growth--the original goals and social  responsiveness through job creation, will be achieved in 1994.    [Herrera] Why will the monetary reserves not grow?    [Abril] Growth of the monetary reserves depends on economic  growth, but we absolutely do not believe that reserves will be  less than $1.2 billion at the end of 1994.    [Herrera] Given these prospects, will Ecuador reinitiate  payments to the creditor banks?    [Abril] We do not know. It depends on the foreign debt  negotiations.    [Herrera] With the latest adjustments in gasoline prices,  which seems to have been one of the IMF's demands, the way would  be open.    [Abril] I would like someone to certify for me what the IMF  demands. I do not know why everyone has that on their mind: the  IMF demands. We are negotiating economic rehabilitation that  will raise the country's prestige in the eyes of international  agencies, among others the banks, but these are things that we  are planning.    [Herrera] As a sovereign country?    [Abril] Correct. I have not seen any IMF mission here that  is  demanding anything from the government's economic team. These  are our proposals about the best way to reach economic stability  in the country, including an agreement with private banks.    It is a problem that should not puzzle anyone. The country  must pay its debts, first, to all of the multilateral lending  agencies, such as the World Bank, the IDB [Inter-American  Development Bank], the Andean Development Corporation and  European governments, which constitute the sources of support,  in large part, for the nation's investment.    In addition, we have a problem dating back years. It is one  of not negotiating with private banks, and it is blocking an  important flow of private investment capital and affecting the  country's development, but nobody is imposing anything.    [Herrera] If investment in the country has declined, is the  British magazine THE ECONOMIST correct when it discusses this  subject?    [Abril] For investment to take place in a country, certain  elements are required that are generally based on a stable  economy, and from that point of view this government has managed  to create a perception of stability that is attractive for  foreign investment.    Another factor is political stability, which means that the  established rules of the game, whatever they may be, are  maintained. But if what is happening in Ecuador is the case,  that once a rule is established it is immediately changed by  political or economic circumstances, then we lose credibility  abroad, and this is very harmful to the country, but it is not  necessarily the fault of the national government.    A third element that attracts foreign investment is labor  productivity, comparative advantage, and the country's  resources, but if labor in Ecuador has low productivity because  of poor education, poor training, and low adaptability, then it  is not attractive for companies in which technology is intensive  and changes rapidly.    [Herrera] Is the lack of trained manpower the major problem?    [Abril] It is not desirable to come to a country where  manpower cannot be trained and retrained when required. It is  the great national problem and we are working on it very hard:  the general secretary for planning and the Ministry of Education  are working constantly to deal with this problem, and there is  already concrete progress: we have adapted to modern  circumstances with a new program to train human resources.    The situation will not change overnight. These are  requirements that Ecuador fulfills in part, but sometimes it  does not, and this is often due to political instability.    [Herrera] Although there may be political factors, why is  there no progress in the process of modernization of the state,  and why has the new leadership for CONAM [National Modernization  Council] not been named, following the resignations of its  president and director?    [Abril] The delay in passing the law obviously blocked  progress in the process of state modernization, particularly the  public sector and the turning over to the private sector of  those areas it can manage efficiently. Once the law is  passed--and it is not what was needed for a dynamic process of  modernization because it still has important restrictions--we  will go forward.    Everything possible is being done, such as the sale of  financial assets of the National Financial Corporation, the  Ecuadoran Bank for Housing. Shares in the Selva Alegre cement  company are about to be issued. The Ecuadoran Aviation case is  almost completed.    It is true that new leadership for CONAM has not been named  to manage that institution, but there is a technical working  group made up of officials from the Finance Ministry, CONADE and  the Comptroller's Office that is moving ahead, preparing solid  modernization programs.    [Herrera] The sale of shares in the Financial Corporation  and  the Ecuadoran Aviation case occurred before passage of the  modernization law. When will the government definitively start  the process?    [Abril] These matters are under constant study. While the  law  was under debate, all situations were studied in which  privatization or conversion to a concession were feasible.    Programs are already in progress in the hydrocarbons sector,  such as pipeline construction; in the electric energy sector,  turning over new generating capacity in small power plants to  private enterprise, as well as aeolian power (electricity  generated by the wind), among others.    The state has not stood still. If one is unable to see a  transfer to the private sector, it is because the definitive  legal framework has not been created, but greater dynamism will  be evident this year.    [Herrera] Will the government propose new laws and reforms?    [Abril] Certainly. We have several, such as the law on  electric energy, the law on concessions, on telecommunications,  on government contracts, reforms of the monetary system law, and  agrarian reform.    There are a great number of changes in the laws that are  already prepared and they are being discussed with various  social sectors to seek consensus.  <H5>  [Box, p 5A] </H5> <H5>  On Investments and Salaries </H5>   The central government's investments for 1994 declined to  110  billion sucres, following the dramatic fall in the price of  petroleum on the world market to $10 per barrel.    Nevertheless, Galo Abril, planning secretary for CONADE,  said  that many of the projects in the investment program would not  necessarily be halted, because they will be carried out with  other sources of financing, such as the State Bank.    A reduction in investment will be in effect for some of the  large companies, such as EMETEL [State-Owned Telecommunications  Company], PETROECUADOR [Ecuadoran State Petroleum Enterprise],  INECEL [Ecuadoran Institute for Electrification], among other  autonomous agencies.    "The reductions are not such as to change the government's  goals in the composition of current spending. Public investment  remains in proportion to national income, about 8 percent of  gross domestic product (GDP); in 1993 it was 7 percent," said  Abril, reiterating that this was no reason to expect an economic  debacle.    [Herrera] Will the price of gas increase?    [Abril] This is a matter of restructuring budgetary income  and spending, the general subsidies that benefit everyone, to  focus subsidies directly on the poor, and with the money saved  carry out social and public works. We are working on that.    [Herrera] Is this the only measure still to be taken?    [Abril] Yes, it is within the budget deficit under study. If  the deficit cannot be covered with an increase in the value  added tax, another source will have to be found. Therefore, with  the adjustable duty on the price of gasoline, if the price of  crude rises on the international market, tax revenues will  improve and fuel prices will go down.    [Herrera] And what do you have to say about salaries?    [Abril] Salaries will be reviewed in July, as the law  provides.    [Herrera] Would these be salaries only, or the minimum wage?    [Abril] We do not know. At the moment, there will be a  review. It depends on how different cost components evolve and  other factors, whether to choose one of the two, or to adjust  both.</p>

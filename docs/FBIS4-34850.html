			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 24 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- The nearly 100 Cuban  refugees at the Belgian and German diplomatic missions must  leave those facilities or "confine themselves for life in what  will be a voluntary cell," the official newspaper GRANMA warned  today. "No one will ever obtain authorization to emigrate  through violence and the violation of Cuban and international  laws," the newspaper, mouthpiece of the ruling Communist Party,  reiterated.    This Friday, the official newspaper reported the  "unconditional" departure of eight persons who entered the  Chilean Consulate on 15 June and demanded permission to leave  the island. The eight occupants, six men, one woman, and a  12-year-old boy, left the mission at 1730 (2130 GMT) on Thursday  in two official Chilean Consulate vehicles, a source at the  mission stated.    A Chilean consulate source explained that none of the people  occupying the South American mission in Havana had ever been  charged with any criminal offense, and their stay in the mission  took place without incident.    GRANMA also pointed out that 53 of the Cubans who decided to  enter the residence of Belgian Ambassador Paul Vermeirsch on 28  May had changed their minds about "their illegal and  irresponsible conduct" and have "returned to their daily lives."    An official spokesman said that "21 persons who occupied the  German Embassy on 13 June remain inside, while 72 Cubans remain  inside the Belgian mission." Ambassador Vermiersch's home and  the German mission are two blocks from each other and are  located in the diplomatic district of Miramar, as is the Chilean  Consulate. The streets leading to the two diplomatic missions  remain closed to vehicles and pedestrians, except for neighbors.  Dozens of uniformed police officers and state security agents  dressed in civilian clothes provide permanent security  throughout the area.    GRANMA also said that the Cuban Government has given "every  assurance to representatives of the parties involved to solve  the problem." "We reiterate: Future incidents of this type can  be prevented only with energy, intelligence, and serenity," the  official daily concludes.</p>

			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / SIB issues warning over banned futures director THE SECURITIES and Investments Board yesterday warned that a futures company whose managing director has been banned from dealing with UK retail investors may be touting for business again. SIB, the financial services watchdog, has received a copy of an undated sales brochure purportedly issued by First European Futures International which sells financial futures and commodities from Brussels and Copenhagen. The managing director is named as Mr Enver Deen, formerly with Vandersteen, a Belgian futures broker against which SIB obtained injunc-tions in 1990 to prevent it cold-calling investors and issuing unauthorised advertisements. In 1991, SIB was granted a distribution order by the High Court to pay Pounds 129,000 to 68 investors in Vandersteen, after the liquidation of the company. Under the Financial Services Act, it is illegal for unauthorised investment companies to solicit business in the UK, but some companies try to elude the rules by operating from overseas. SIB says there was a flurry of such business immediately after the act came into force, but that such cases are now rare. In the brochure obtained by SIB, the company falsely claims to be authorised by the Securities and Futures Authority, the regulator for the securities industry, and by SIB and to be a member of a number of futures exchanges. An official said SIB had no evidence that First European Futures had been cold-calling UK retail investors. A booklet, 'How to spot the investment cowboys', is available from SIB, which also offers information on 071 929 3652.</p>

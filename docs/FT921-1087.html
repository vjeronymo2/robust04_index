			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Durable goods orders down US DURABLE goods orders fell slightly last month, offering a warning that a full recovery may not yet be under way. New orders for durable goods dropped by 0.1 per cent in February to Dollars 120.5bn, after two months when they had shown strong increases, the Commerce Department said yesterday. Private sector economists had expected the increases to continue with a 1.6-1.8 per cent rise in February, but did not view the decline in the often volatile durable goods figures as evidence that the incipient recovery had halted. Excluding the defence industry, new orders rose by a seasonally adjusted 1.3 per cent to Dollars 114.2bn, while shipments of durable goods in February climbed by 2.6 per cent to Dollars 116.2bn. Evidence of that a recovery might be under way came when the National Association of Realtors announced that sales of existing single-family homes had risen by 9.3 per cent in February.</p>

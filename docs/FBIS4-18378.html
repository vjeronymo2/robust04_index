			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, April 1 (A.A.) -- The Foreign Ministry said  on Thursday [31 March] that Amnesty International was distorting  the law and facts once again.    Foreign Ministry Spokesman Ferhat Ataman told the Anatolian  Agency that Turkey was one of the countries who received the  highest number of requests for asylum because of the tension in  neighboring countries over the last 15 years.    "Without receiving assistance in many cases, Turkey has  graciously extended help to these people, by going beyond its  legislation," he said.    Ataman stressed that the accusations of Amnesty  International  that those asking asylum in Turkey were harassed by the police,  were untrue.    "The policy of Turkey is not to send any person back, unless  there are forcible reasons," he said.    Ataman also stressed that claims that foreign delegations  were treated badly in Turkey were a distortion.    "The death threats of the separatist terror organization on  voters and candidates in the southeast have created a serious  terror and security problem in the region," he said.    "Our security units have naturally taken into account the  security of the so-called observer delegations and the risks  posed by the provocations of some of these in the region," he  said.    Ataman stressed that it was very meaningful for Amnesty  International to refrain from accepting terrorism as an activity  which should be banned.    He added that by calling terrorists "guerrillas" Amnesty was  legitimizing the terror organization.</p>

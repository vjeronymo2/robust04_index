Martsinovskiy, Moscow; UDC  616.995.122-07:616.34-076:619]    [Text] Metagonymiasis is helminthosis from the group of  intestinal Trematoda infestation caused by the  parasitic activity of the Metagonimus yokagawai  Trematoda in the thin intestine of humans and a number of  ichthyophagous animals [Katsurada, 1918]. Its etiologic agent is  a small helminth with an elongated shape and a size of  (1-2.5)x(0.4-0.7) mm. The purpose of this study is to examine  the morphological pattern of the thin intestine mucous membrane  of fish-eating animals.    Research material and methodology. The study was carried out  in the Ulchskiy rayon of Khabarovsk kray with endemic  metagonymiasis. Twelve cats were examined by the method of  partial helminthological autopsy. The small intestine and liver  were used for the histological study. The material fixed in a  10% formaldehyde solution was poured into paraffin. Five  micrometer thick sections were stained with hematoxylin and  eosin.    Findings and discussion. No pathological changes were  discovered during the histological examination of the liver. A  moderate lymphoidal infiltration of the portal tract was  discovered only in four out of 12 cats. A study of the empty  intestine revealed metagonima which were positioned one by one  or in the form of large conglomerates in the intestine  clearance, i.e., between the villi and in the crypts (see  figure, a-d).   <FIG ID=JPRS-UST-013-57A>      Figure </FIG>    Thin feline intestine in the case of  metagonymiasis. Magnification x100. Stained with hematoxylin and  eosin: a--Metagonimus in the depth of the intestine crypt;  b--Metagonimus in the intestinal clearance and freely positioned  villi fragments; A large number of enterocytes and diffuse  intestinal infiltration of the intrinsic villus plate; c--Two  metagonima in the cryptal layer of the atrophic mucous membrane;  d--Metagonima conglomeration.&lt;/graphic&gt;     The changes in the intestinal mucous membrane were mosaic in  character. At times, the crypts were elongated, while in the  other mucous membrane areas, they were shortened. The villi had  different shapes and size. In addition to the usual finger- and  leaf-shaped villi, one could also see highly shortened,  expanded, and deformed shapes with nonuniform swelling and  constrictions. The surface epithelium was deformed, and the  boundaries between individual cells-- blurred; the height of the  epitheliocytes was reduced, especially at the peaks of the villi  where a subepithelial edema was often observed. The number of  goblet-shaped cells was sharply decreased, and in some cases,  they were arranged in groups (see figure, b, c). Goblet-shaped  enterocytes were located not only near the base and in the mid  third of the villi but also in the distal section and even at  the tips of the villi. Interepithelial lymphocytes were often  found among the enterocytes. In the mucous membrane plate proper  (both in the villi and cryptal layers), considerable cellular  infiltration was revealed (see figure, a, b, c) whereby  neutrophile leukocytes were observed alongside lymphocytes and  plasmocytes.    The above morphological changes in the small intestine's  mucous membrane in the case of metagonymiasis should be  interpreted as chronic diffuse-focal chronic jejunitis with  atrophic phenomena. We should note that detection of metagonima  is complicated in histological preparations of the small  intestine because their dimensions and shape are very close to  those of the intestinal villi and their fragments (see figure,  a, b, c). It has been established [1] that the luminal surface  of the small intestine in humans and various animals in the case  of not only enteropathy but also under physiological conditions  contains three agglomerations of epithelial plasty and tubular  structures as well as braided and isolated intact villi and  their distal fragments with rounded ends (the phenomenon of  mucous membrane structure rejection during the lifetime). The  free-lying oval-elongated structures also formed in the  histological preparations due to the random character of the  villi sections (slices). On the other hand, the metagonima  conglomerates filled with light brown eggs (see figure g) can be  mistaken for unwashed intestinal contents under a low microscope  magnification.    Thus, metagonymiasis in fish-eating animals is a factor of  intestinal disorder which facilitates the development of chronic  diffuse-focal jejunitis with atrophic phenomena.  Bibliography    1. M.V.

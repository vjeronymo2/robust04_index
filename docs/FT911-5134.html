			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / International Company News: Perrier wins trickle from a Catalan source THE FRENCH may not have won a battle this important in Spain since they took Barcelona in the War of the Spanish Succession 277 years ago. A Catalan court has ruled that the French mineral water giant, Perrier, had a rightful claim to a small fee for every litre of water sold by the only producer of naturally carbonated water outside of France, Vichy Catalan. Although Perrier will earn a mere Dollars 1,040 a year from the ruling, the victory is an important legal foothold from which to press its attack on Europe's fastest growing mineral water market. It has taken the French much of this century to break through the Catalan defences. The story begins in 1881, when a Catalan doctor, Modest Furest i Roca, discovered a spring near Gerona whose waters resembled those he had once enjoyed in Vichy, France. His enthusiasm for the bicarbonated waters persuaded some Catalan businessmen to back his plans to bottle it. Furest apparently registered the name Vichy in Spain first. Today the company is the biggest supplier of fizzy and still mineral waters in Spain. Since Perrier took over management of Vichy Celestins more than 40 years ago it has tried desperately to enter the Spanish market with a vichy water. Catalan courts have handed down victory after victory to the home team. In 1988, however, the stalking French managed to buy about 6 per cent of Vichy Catalan from one of the five Furest descendants, for about Dollars 2.5m. Since then it has argued in the courts that it has a right to the canon each of the descendants gets on a litre of Vichy Catalan sold (one fifth of a peseta per litre) and to inspect production. Last year a lower court in Barcelona would not admit the acquisition. But Perrier appealed and, though the higher court would not allow it to inspect production, it has recognised the right to a share of the sales. Vichy Catalan is saying nothing.</p>

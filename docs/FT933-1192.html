			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (30): Infrastructure tops agenda - India / After 40 years of avowed economic self-reliance, India is opening up to the outside world IN TWO SHORT years, the Indian economy has been dragged from the verge of international bankruptcy and put firmly on the road towards sustainable growth. But the further the country has moved from the economic crisis it faced in mid-1991, the more it has lost speed in its economic restructuring programme. For a combination of political, economic and social reasons, the government of Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, has allowed the momentum to slow. Ministers have made many reforms designed to free the economy, notably liberalising trade rules, reducing the public deficit and introducing a market-based exchange rate. They also plan to do more - including reforming the debt-encumbered banks. But they have shied away from politically-difficult decisions - such as closing loss-making state-owned enterprises and abolishing jobs-for-life labour laws. In part, the reformers have fallen victim to their own success. From a low point of 1.2 per cent in the year to March 1992, economic growth has recovered remarkably fast to 4 per cent in 1992-93, and a forecast 5 per cent in the current year. Inflation has fallen from an annual peak of 13.6 per cent to about 6 per cent. Foreign currency reserves have jumped from a nadir of just over USDollars 1bn in mid-1991 to USDollars 7.3bn. Exports are soaring - by 27 per cent in the four months to July, according to the latest figures. In these circumstances, it has been difficult for Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, to persuade his colleagues in the ruling Congress (I) party of the urgency of the need for further economic reform. Ministers have also had other things on their minds. Last year's Rs40bn scandal in the Bombay securities market has been an immense distraction and will continue to occupy time until a Parliamentary inquiry into the affair is finally completed, possibly early next year. The destruction of the Ayodhya mosque by Hindu militants last December, and the inter-religious unrest which followed has shaken the government to the core. Mr Narasimha Rao's top priority has been to contain the political damage. He cannot risk alienating the public with painful economic restructuring when the Bharatiya Janata Party, the radical Hindu opposition party, seems to be gathering support through its appeal for greater self-assertiveness for Hindus. The immediate challenge comes later this year when elections are due in the four northern states where BJP-controlled assemblies were suspended last year. In theory, economic reform should have immense political appeal. Only about 25-30m workers and their families - perhaps 150m people altogether - have benefited fully from the socialist-inspired economy built after independence. These are the people who are protected by law from being sacked and who enjoy reasonable standards of living, healthcare and education for their children. The remaining 700m-plus of India's population of 880m largely live beyond the reach of the organised economy and of the organised welfare network. These poor could be the long-run beneficiaries of the increased economic opportunities created by liberalisation. However, even though India is a democracy, poverty and ignorance prevents the poor from exercising much broad-based political pressure. They have been too easily divided by religion, caste and language. By contrast, organised workers, acting through trade unions and employers' organisations have been able to apply pressure - notably through strikes in support of demands that liberalisation should not put their jobs at risk. Nevertheless, even trade union pressure cannot put the clock back. After 40 years of avowed economic self-reliance, India is opening up to the outside world by cutting import duties, reforming the exchange rate and promoting exports and inward foreign investment. The licence raj, a panoply of industrial controls, has mostly been dismantled. Despite the securities scandal, financial deregulation has gone ahead, including the liberalising of foreign institutional investment. Businessmen are planning new projects at an unprecedented rate. Foreign companies are reviving links with old affiliates and partners, and establishing new contacts. Big groups are restructuring operations to cope with the challenge of foreign competition and of raising exports. So far, this surge in activity has not resulted in any concomitant leap in investment. Industrial production in the year to March grew by a mere 3.8 per cent. Only a modest 5-6 per cent is forecast for 1993-94. Foreign investors have won approvals for projects worth USDollars 3bn, but there is no rush to actually invest the money. Certainly, large schemes are not completed overnight, or even in a year or two. However, at least part of the delay is due to the fact that companies are not yet convinced of the government's commitment to further reform. The main obstacle for many companies is the grip that the bureaucracy continues to maintain on the economy. While instructions have gone out from the Cabinet for the abolition of swathes of controls, the officials carrying out the orders are dragging their feet. Also, the very process of reform itself creates new opportunities for bureaucratic intervention. For example, the opening up of investment in power to private companies has generated mountains of documents dealing with the terms under which such companies might operate. Investors are also concerned about the future of public-sector enterprises which account for about two-thirds of workers in large-scale employment and an even higher share of the nation's industrial capital. The government's policy has been to starve loss-making units of funds to force them either to seek private capital (which very few are strong enough to attract) or cut costs. But the government is unwilling to permit large-scale job reductions. Indian law greatly restricts employers' rights to dismiss workers. Ministers late last year came close to reforming labour legislation - but retreated just before the Ayodhya outrage. Without reform, the public sector will drain resources from the rest of the economy. It will also hold back private companies because of the inefficiency of many of its services - such as telecommunications and banking. Finally, India's growth potential will be limited without further investment in infrastructure and in social services such as education. The government has made infrastructure investment a priority but it lacks the money to fulfil its aims because of the general squeeze on public spending. The position in power is particularly acute - capacity rose just one per cent last year. The government would like private companies to help close the yawning gaps in India's infrastructure. But the provision of public services is precisely the area which the bureaucrats and public sector trade unions hold most dear. Spending limits on education and other social services are equally tight. India has long spent less on primary schools than many other developing countries, including China, and is only now beginning to redirect its resources. The result is that India's literacy rate is still only 48 per cent against China's 73 per cent. Without better education, the poor cannot get jobs nor learn about basic health care, including birth control. India has done enough in the last two years to encourage fast growth in important cities such as Delhi, Bombay, Bangalore and Madras. But without further reforms - and infrastructure investment - it is difficult to see how fast growth can be sustained even in these centres let alone spread into less prosperous regions.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         INDIA: KEY INDICATORS* (%)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                      89-90      90-91     91-92    92-93**   93-94***  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- GDP growth             5.6        5.2       1.2      4.0       5.0 Fiscal deficit         7.9        8.4       6.0      5.7       4.7 Inflation              9.1       12.1      13.6      7.0       5.6  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Years to March; ** Government estimates; *** Government projections  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Ministry of Finance  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

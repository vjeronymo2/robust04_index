The source was commenting on the Syrian-U.S. summit  being held in Geneva between Presidents Bill Clinton and Hafiz  al-Asad.    The source referred to the progress on certain tracks of the  Arab-Israeli peace process, noting that there has been important  progress on the Palestinian-Israeli track and progress on the  Israeli-Jordanian track. He pointed out that the Syrian track  has failed to make progress and has reached a stalemate, which  threatens the peace efforts. A peace without Syria would be a  "lame" peace, because an important party to the conflict would  not have resolved its problems with Israel.    The source said that the peace-loving parties pin great  hopes  on the Syrian-U.S. summit reaching positive results and  generating momentum in the Syrian-Israeli negotiations. He said  that the United States has always emphasized its interest in the  success of its peaceful initiatives so that the Middle Eastern  countries can devote their efforts to promoting their economies.  He stressed that there is hope that both Syria and Israel will  emerge from the vicious cycle and spell out their real  intentions so that peace may be achieved in the region.</p>

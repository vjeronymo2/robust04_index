			<p>BFN     [Text] On 12 April, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa  discussed with Muneaki Samejima, deputy chief secretary of the  Japan New Party, the issue of expanding parliamentary group  "Kaikaku [Reform]" to include other political forces. During  the discussions at the prime minister's official residence, he  said: "It is important for the ruling coalition to go back to  the spirit in which they started out and maintain the current  framework. On the other hand, it is also necessary to invite  other political forces to the ruling coalition." In this way he  indicated that, based on the current formation of seven  political parties and one parliamentary group, the ruling  coalition should establish a new framework by inviting some  Liberal Democratic Party members.</p>

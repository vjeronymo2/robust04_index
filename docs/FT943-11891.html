			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Delay ordered for Thai rail project The Thai government yesterday postponed the construction of a Dollars 1.5bn elevated railway which would have been the first system to enter service in the capital, reviving doubts about plans to build mass transit networks to alleviate Bangkok's traffic congestion. The delay is also likely to increase the reluctance of foreign investors to take part in politically controversial infrastructure projects in Thailand. It follows difficulties experienced with other projects including 'Skytrain' in 1992 and the Kumagai Gumi elevated motorway in Bangkok which was effectively nationalised earlier this year. Bangkok Transit System Corp (BTSC), a subsidiary of the Tanayong property group, had been due to begin preliminary work on the 24km of elevated railway lines yesterday but the cabinet ordered a halt pending a resolution of disputes over planning permission. Earlier this month, BTSC awarded a turnkey construction contract for the system worth Dollars 1.1bn to a joint venture between Siemens of Germany and Italian-Thai Development, the leading Thai construction company. Financing for the deal, which would have raised the total cost by some Dollars 400m, has yet to be finalised. Yesterday, the government said it had ordered the Juridical Council, an arbitration body, to consider whether a 4km extension to the original 1991 concession could go ahead legally; the extension was agreed after laws on the environment and privatisation came into force in 1992. The cabinet also complained that plans to manage road traffic during construction had not been sent to the authorities in time. But some political commentators believe the real reason for the delay is government nervousness over no-confidence motions in parliament this week. Opposition MPs say they have evidence of illegal actions committed by the government in connection with the project. Successive governments have failed to plan for the rapid expansion of Bangkok or to agree on how to improve transport for the city's long-suffering commuters. Even if the BTSC project proceeds it is not clear how it will be connected to other proposed systems. Thailand is seeking to farm out some big infrastructure project to the private sector in 'build-operate-transfer' concessions such as the one granted to BTSC, but a series of hitches have affected investor confidence in large Thai projects. The most notorious case of a failed project was the Skytrain; Thailand finally cancelled the Dollars 2.6bn project, which was to have been built by SNC-Lavalin of Canada, in 1992 after 17 years of negotiations.</p>

			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Reluctant miners to sell HQ in Durham DURHAM miners have reluctantly bowed to history and put their Durham headquarters - one of the most imposing union premises in the UK - up for sale. Red Hill, built in 1915 and financed by Durham Miners Association members' contributions, is a domed baroque-style grade II-listed building with landscaped gardens flanked by statues of Durham miners' past leaders. The complex, which includes a Georgian villa, a gatehouse and houses for officials of the National Union of Mineworkers, was a powerful symbol of the time when 180,000 men worked in almost 200 pits in the Durham coal-field. Today just one pit remains - Wearmouth, which employs just 700 NUM members. Mr Davy Guy, north-east area president, said the decision to sell Red Hill was financial, but added: 'It's been made with a heavy heart.' The NUM would prefer the building to be sold to to a union or educational organisation, and for ideological reasons is unenthusiastic at the prospect of Red Hill becoming a corporate headquarters. But Wilson Kinnair Commercial of Blyth, Northumberland, the agents, believe office or hotel use might be appropriate. Tender offers are invited by November 16.</p>

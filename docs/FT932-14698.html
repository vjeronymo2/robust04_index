			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Asian bank considers acquisition MEGHRAJ BANK, the private banking arm of Meghraj group, is exploring the possibility of acquiring Equatorial Bank, which served about 3,000 Asian small-business customers in the UK before it went into administration last month. The Asian community has been affected by the closure of four banks in the past year, following the collapse of Bank of Credit and Commerce International in 1991. Roxburghe Bank went into administration earlier this month. Mount Banking was wound up last October while Albaraka International Bank's deposit-taking activities have been suspended. Mr Anant Shah, chairman of Meghraj Bank said: 'With liquidity at around 60 per cent and with assets of over Pounds 225m, we are in a strong financial condition. This gives us the ability to consider acquisitions and affords Meghraj Bank a unique opportunity to strengthen its presence in the Asian community in the UK.' The bank has offices in the Isle of Man, Luxembourg and Liechtenstein and an associate company in Jersey. Meghraj said it had instructed Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountants, to investigate the possible acquisition.</p>

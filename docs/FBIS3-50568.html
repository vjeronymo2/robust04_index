Before the president's visit, only half a dozen Mexican  enterprises (banks, among them) had invested in Argentina.    Benefiting from the signing of NAFTA, the Mexicans have  begun  to conquer markets, among them Argentina.    In the Argentine market, Mexican interest has focused on the  car parts industries, prospecting for and the exploitation of  oil and gas, textile fibers, farm industry, and cement.    Yet as opposed to what happened with European countries and  with the United States, "rather than speaking about an inflow of  capital, we should speak about economic supplementation," as  Mexican Embassy commercial affairs counselor Gonzalo Cervera  Diaz Lombardo put it.    Despite the fact that the balance of trade registers a $61  million surplus in favor of Argentina, Mexican investment in  Argentina surpasses Argentine investment in Mexico.  <H5>  First Investors </H5>   The Economic Culture Fund [FCE] was the first investor. It  arrived in Argentina in 1944 to engage in the book publishing  business.    For three years now this enterprise, whose annual sales  amount to $1.5 million, has published books on economics,  philosophy, and history -- among other subjects -- on the local  market.    Alejandro Katz, president of the Argentine branch of the  Fund, said that the enterprise will expand here through a  network of FCE bookstores.    Mexican banks, in turn, arrived in a group.    Mexico's strongest banks, the National Bank of Mexico  (Banamex), Bancomer [Bank of Commerce], the International Bank,  the National Finance Bank (Nafinsa), and the National Foreign  Trade Bank of Mexico (Bancomex), installed foreign trade  offices. They also participate in the capital market, look for  potential Mexican investors here (and vice versa), and operate  as a beachhead for other businesses.    For example, Banamex purchased 29 percent of Banco del Sud  shares, paying $23.6 million, and now stands as the majority  stock owner, with 27 percent of the shares.    Nafinsa, 66 percent of which is owned by the Mexican state,  brought concrete business proposals, as Nafinsa representative  Elias Rivas Torres put it. The proposals are:    -- A Mexican fast food business will begin operating on the  Argentine market.    -- The local firm Massuh and Mexico's Celfimex created an  industrial waste processing enterprise. The new firm, Mexar,  called for an initial investment of $800,000. It will be  located in Quilmes, and expects sales to reach $3 million in the  first year.    In addition, Nafinsa intends to give financial support to  Argentine firms willing to do business with Mexican firms.  <H5>  Synthetic Fibers </H5>   In August 1992, Saul Dessau sold the powerful Synkro Group,  the manufacturer of Modecraft women's stockings. Synkro is  engaged in the areas of shoes, cosmetics, and janitorial and  textile products. With scheduled investments of $10 million, a  new plant will be built in addition to the plant in Trelew. This  organization, the world's second largest stocking manufacturer,  will hit the South American market from Argentina. Dorian Gray,  Carla Conti, and Paloma Picaso are the women's stockings  trademarks manufactured by the new enterprise: Arco Plus  Argentina.    The Mexican firm Cellulose and Byproducts bought 37 percent  of the Argentine enterprise Cordonsed.    The Mexicans also participated in the privatization process.  <H5>  Argentine Partners </H5>   The Mexican Development Group, in partnership with Benito  Roggio and a Brazilian organization, has been awarded  exploitation of the western access highway to Buenos Aires for  20 years.    The partnership, the Western Corridor Group (GCO), will  invest $160 million to put the highway joining Buenos Aires and  Lujan in order. According to Orlando Vyeira, international  director of the Maxican party, they decided to settle here  because "we see a great future in Argentina." The Mexican group  is also interested in electric power generation, water supply  and processing, construction, ports, and airports.    Mexpetrol has been awarded the prospecting for,  exploitation,  and development of hydrocarbons in El Porton and Buta Ranquil.  The Mexican firm, whose partners are Astra and YPF [Government  Oil Deposits], has committed itself to making investments of at  least $55 million.    Enrique Molina is another businessman who is interested in  Argentina.    Molina, who is studying several projects, is enthusiastic  about the construction of a Ritz Carlton Hotel. He is also  considering the local sugar market. In the first undertaking  there is also the possibility of buying a hotel and remodeling  it.    Molina, who owns Mexico's Pepsi Bottling Company, is  interested in Argentina's San Martin del Tabacal, which produces  sugar, alcohol, and citrus fruits.    Tabacal Vice President Eduardo Patron Costas told LA NACION  that the Mexican businessman might invest $30 to $50 million in  the Argentine company, whose annual sales stand at $60 million  and which is now undergoing a process of restructuring and  diversification.    After a visit to Mexico by its executives two months ago  Lactona, another company that has been engaging in conversations  with Mexican entrepreneurs, is negotiating with two Mexican  firms for the large-scale manufacture of long-life products.</p>

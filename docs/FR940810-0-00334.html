The national evaluation standards were adopted in 1989 and represented the best thinking at that time about how to implement the statutory evaluation requirements. They were predicated largely on the perceived need to use a measure that would provide data that could be aggregated for the Nation_i.e., nationally normed tests or tests equated with national norms_even though the statute itself does not require aggregation to either the State or national level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since then, two developments of national significance have required a change in those national standards. First, a number of States have developed new assessment systems, linked to their statewide education reform efforts, to improve the quality of education in their States. These assessment systems are tied to high State standards for what children should know and be able to do, but in some instances are inconsistent with the national evaluation standards because they do not routinely rely on nationally normed tests and typically only assess children in certain grades. As a result, these States must operate separate assessment systems: ones that they use to make informed decisions about the effectiveness of education programs in their State; and ones that they use only for Chapter 1 or MEP purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a related matter, major educational reform legislation, the Goals 2000: Educate America Act (Pub. L. 103&hyph;227), became law on March 31, 1994. Section 306(c) of Goals 2000 requires reform plans developed under the statute to include a description of the process a State will use to develop State assessments aligned with the State's content standards and that the assessments be for all students, including students with diverse learning needs. These regulations will allow States that have assessment systems tied to statewide education reform, developed under Goals 2000 or another effort, to obtain exceptions from existing Chapter 1 and MEP evaluation requirements and, subject to less prescriptive standards in these regulations, use their statewide assessments for Chapter 1 and MEP purposes. By allowing those States that already have developed assessment systems tied to statewide education reform efforts to obtain exceptions from existing Chapter 1 and MEP evaluation requirements, these regulations permit those States to focus their energies on the new assessments without having to implement a separate assessment system for Chapter 1 and MEP that may not support reform efforts. The Secretary believes that requiring these States to operate separate assessment systems for Chapter 1 and MEP purposes serves neither the interests of participating children nor the Federal programs involved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

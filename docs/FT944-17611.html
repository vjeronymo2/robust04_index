			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Brown denies planning for sterling crisis Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, yesterday rejected suggestions in a newspaper that he had started to plan for a sterling crisis after the next general election. In an interview with Tribune, a leftwing Labour weekly, Mr Brown was quoted as saying that he was seeking agreements with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in advance of the general election. The report raised the spectre of international intervention along the lines of the 1976 economic crisis when the then Mr Denis Healey, Labour chancellor, was forced to call on IMF help to restore currency stability. However, Labour officials said Mr Brown's comments had been misinterpreted. They said he was referring to the general problem of financial market instability, and insisted that there was 'no question' of plans for an IMF rescue package. The Tribune article refers to the pressure on sterling that greeted the 1929 and 1964 Labour governments, and says that Mr Brown was asked 'about the inevitable run on the pound'. Mr Brown is quited as replying: 'We are already working on plans to tackle the problem, should it arise. We are under no illusions. 'But we are seeking . . . new international agreements through the World Bank and the IMF. We are doing this in advance of the next election through our various contacts.' Mr Brown was then asked: 'Are you saying that the speculators and the modern gnomes of Zurich can be checked?' He responded: 'Yes, I believe they can. I believe it can be made much more difficult for the international speculators and gamblers.' He added: 'I really do believe we can ride that threat.' Mr Brown's aides said he had been quoted accurately. But they said that the possibility of a sterling crisis following the election of a Labour government had never been put to him. An adviser said: 'What he was asked was: 'Are you worried about the problem of instability and speculation in financial markets, and could this be a problem for a Labour government?'' Mr Brown, who raised the prospect of greater international co-ordination in his conference speech on Monday, will travel to Washington next week for talks with US officials which will include discussions on market instability.</p>

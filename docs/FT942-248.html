			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Athens balks at airline ruling Greece is objecting to conditions proposed by the European Commission in return for approval of a rescue package for Olympic Airways, the loss-making state carrier. Athens believes the conditions would undermine a plan designed to return the airline to profit by 1997. Fresh talks are due to be held in Brussels next month. The Commission wants Olympic to drop its monopoly of ground handling operations at Greek airports immediately and allow two other airlines to offer competitive services. Greece also objects to the Commission's requests that Olympic freeze its seat capacity while the three-year restructuring plan is in effect, and open up its profitable Aegean island routes to competition from 1998. The restructuring plan calls for writing off almost Dr500bn (Pounds 1.34bn) in accumulated debt and providing Dr53bn in fresh capital over the next three years.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Kim Chong-tu: "There Is No Special Sign of </F> Provocation From the North Korean Military"]    [Text] At the 19 March South-North working-level contact,  North Korea made the remark: "Seoul will become a sea of fire."  Since then, military authorities have been assiduously analyzing  the true intention of such a remark and have been very sensitive  to the conduct of the North Korean military. An analysis of  their behavior since 22 March by military authorities reveals  that such a remark stems from a high-powered strategy and tactic  to occupy favorable ground in the negotiations with the South  and the United States. No signs of aggression can be detected  in the conduct of the North Korean military. According to  military intelligence sources, the North Korean military is  currently carrying out winter season training exercises. North  Korea is carrying out large-scale military training exercises.  It designates December to March as the winter season training  period and July to August as the summer season training period.  The winter season training period exercises, including joint  infantry, tank, and artillery mobile exercises, are more intense  than during the summer season training period. Regardless of  the remark by the North Korean delegate, the recent conduct of  the North Korean military shows that it is carrying out normal  training. The only difference is that the intensity is enhanced  and the number of training exercises has increased. This is a  common method used when South-North dialogue and DPRK-U.S. talks  are not progressing well.    Even though there is no clear sign of provocation attracting  our interest, the Defense Ministry is not breaking its vigilant  position because the North Korean military is increasing the  number of training exercises, which is worthy of close  attention. Including the armistice line region, North Korea  deployed to the front line 65 percent of its ground forces; 60  percent of its vessels; and 40 percent of its fighter planes  along the region south of Pyongyang and Wonsan. Therefore,  North Korea, which has been propagandizing 1995 as the "year for  reunification," completed a military deployment strong enough  for a full large-scale invasion of the South. North Korea has  also sharply increased exercises that were reduced in 1980.  Moreover, the frontline corps of the North Korean Army  increased exercises by 40 percent, the Navy 15 percent, and the  Air Force 30 percent, compared with last year. These actions  are making the military authorities tense. The military is  closely observing the moves by the North Korean military based  on a list of approximately 100 signs indicating moves for a  southward invasion. Not even 10 percent of the signs from the  list have been observed in the current conduct of the North  Korean military. Nevertheless, the military authorities are  frequently holding contacts with U.S. forces stationed in the  ROK to discuss the conduct of the North Korean military.    On 22 March, the Defense Ministry examined prolonging the  "time- limited readiness," which has been carried out since 1  November 1993, until the crisis on the Korean peninsula is  improved to some degree. Also, before and after President Kim  Yong-sam's visit to Japan and China, a special alert was ordered  for the whole Army. This is a measure that will allow an  immediate reaction to a possible provocation from North Korea.</p>

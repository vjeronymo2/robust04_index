			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / International Company News: Fay, Richwhite turns in NZDollars 7m net FAY, Richwhite, a New Zealand investment bank, yesterday reported net profits of NZDollars 7.1m (USDollars 3.8m) for the first six months to December, compared with NZDollars 6.6m for the nine months ended December 1990, AP-DJ reports from Auckland. The bank has changed its year end to June 30 from March 31. Revenue from Fay, Richwhite's banking operations in the first half totalled NZDollars 40m compared with NZDollars 50m in the earlier nine months. Profits from those operations came to NZDollars 7.7m against NZDollars 15m. Fay, Richwhite received a further NZDollars 9.4m in dividends from it 27 per cent in Bank of New Zealand, a commercial bank. However, the interest costs associated with holding that stake amounted to NZDollars 13m, and the investment in BNZ therefore generated a net loss of NZDollars 3.8m. However, the group's net profits include an equity-accounted gain of NZDollars 3.1m, representing the company's share of BNZ's profits. Mr David Richwhite, joint managing director, said the first-half results were 'pleasing' considering the challenging market conditions. All the investment bank's divisions contributed to earnings, he said. The holding costs of the company's stake in BNZ were declining, reflecting the positive impact of falling domestic interest rates and increasing dividends from BNZ. Although the company did not declare a dividend for the first half, Mr Richwhite said he was confident that profits from investment banking and the improving results from BNZ would enable it to issue a dividend for the full fiscal year ending June 30.</p>

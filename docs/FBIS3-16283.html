			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Colonel General Vasiliy Vorobyev, chief of </F> the Russian Federation Defense Ministry Main Military Budget and  Finance Directorate, by Lieutenant Colonel Ivan Ivanyuk; date  and place not given: "Military Budget Without Abstractions Or  Illusions"]    [Text] This interview could have been justified on a  purely routine basis: The federal budget for the new year is  being adopted, it is necessary to talk about expenditure on the  country's defenses. But it is hard to recall such a powerful  upsurge in public interest in an event that is, generally  speaking, a "formality." The editorial office has received  numerous queries prompted by reports appearing in the mass media  to the effect that it is planned to slash the military budget  and that many articles of the Law on the Status of Servicemen  could be repealed, reports which have caused concern among our  readers. Last year's "budget tribulations," delays of two or  three months in paying wages and servicemen's pay, disruptions  to leave, and unfulfilled plans are still fresh in many people's  memories. Is all this going to be repeated this year, only  worse? We decided to seek first-hand answers, so to speak, to  this and other questions which are currently of concern to Army  and Navy personnel, workers at defense enterprises, and Armed  Forces veterans.    [Ivanyuk] Vasiliy Vasilyevich, the Finance Ministry's  attempts to save on military spending have already been the  subject of a political assessment: The proposed level of  appropriations will lead to the ruin of the country's defense  complex, and in particular the Russian Army, which is basically  the sole island of stability on the territory of the former  USSR....    [Vorobyev] I am no politician, and I would like to refrain  from commentaries of that kind. As far as the military budget  is concerned, I am prepared to speak about it in detail and to  cite illustrations to confirm the validity and authenticity of  every figure. The sums we are asking for are not plucked out of  thin air. The need for defense appropriations for 1994 is  defined in accordance with the requirements of the Russian  Federation Law "On Defense," which envisages a reduction in the  Armed Forces, taking into account the State Defense Order  approved by the Russian Federation Government decree of 21  December 1993 and decisions recently adopted by the country's  top leadership on questions of defense, the financial  stabilization of the economy, and state social support for the  population.    We are aware that the Russian economy is currently going  through a difficult period. Therefore the calculations sent to  the Finance Ministry contain nothing superfluous. The proposed  draft has, above all, a clearly expressed social thrust. The  Defense Ministry pins great hopes on Russian Federation  President B.N. Yeltsin's Message, his speech in the Federal  Assembly on 24 February this year. He said quite specifically:  "In 1994 we have to put an end to the deleterious practice of  one-sided concessions. This applies, among other things, to the  defense budget. It must not be forgotten that spending on  defense is not at all the same thing as spending on war. These  resources go to finance a significant part of our science.  These resources go to build apartments for homeless officers'  families. These resources go to maintain our children who are  serving in the Armed Forces."    [Ivanyuk] What does this mean in actual figures?    [Vorobyev] I do not think there is any point in naming  specific sums. These have not yet been finally confirmed, and  anyway, given the present rate of inflation, they do not tell  you much. If we look at relative figures, 56 percent of the  total military budget consists of expenditure on servicemen's  pay and wages for civilian personnel, paying for rations and  pensions, building housing, maintaining military hospitals,  clinics, sanatoriums, rest homes, and kindergartens, and  carrying out tasks in connection with the provision of  facilities for troops withdrawn from Eastern Europe and the  nearby foreign countries. Furthermore, the appropriations for  the purchase of arms and military equipment and on scientific  research and experimental and design work also include relevant  expenditure at defense complex enterprises, which accounts for  at least 45 percent of the total. Thus social expenditure, or,  to put it another way, the minimum expenditure necessary for  people's normal existence, accounts for a total of three-fourths  of all defense expenditure.    [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA interpolation] Our Information: The  Finance Ministry has cut by a factor of 2.4 the sum requested by  the Defense Ministry. The amount allowed for maintaining the  Army and Navy is set at 61 percent of the sum requested; for  arms, military equipment, and property -- 21 percent; for  scientific and technical output -- 41 percent; for capital  construction and major repairs -- 32 percent; and for  servicemen's pensions -- 76 percent.    In January 1994, 1 trillion rubles [R] was paid over to the  Defense Ministry. Appropriations under the quota established by  the Finance Ministry for February, totaling R1.3 trillion, were  transferred bit by bit, up to 10 March. There was a chronic  shortage of money. And the R371 billion which it is planned to  allocate in March for maintaining the Army and Navy (under  section one of the military budget) is not enough even to cover  the servicemen's pay. [interpolation ends]    [Ivanyuk] One cannot help getting the impression that the  Finance Ministry's proposals for cutting the military budget are  divorced from real life and are purely theoretical and abstract  in nature....    [Vorobyev] This approach could indeed be called abstract.  And not only because the "human factor," as they used to call  it, is not taken into account. Take the actual methodology of  the calculations. The Finance Ministry, in planning defense  spending, takes as a basis the proportion of gross domestic  product (GDP) accounted for by military spending in 1993, and  automatically carries over this indicator, namely 5.02 percent,  to this year's GDP. But tell me, what is the basis for  calculating that GDP will increase by only a factor of 4.5?  What decline or increase in production does this incorporate?  What account is taken of the dynamic of price increases? It  must be said that last year the Finance Ministry failed to take  account of the actual trends in prices for output purchased by  the Defense Ministry. For instance, budget expenditure on the  purchase of arms and military equipment in 1993 was  index-linked, in the main, by a factor of 2.1, although in a  number of instances the actual increase was between fivefold and  12-fold. Or take military uniform. This sustained a 10- or  11-fold increase in price over the year. At the beginning of  this year a complete soldier's uniform cost R500,000.    Many other objective factors were -- and are -- absolutely  left out of the reckoning. At the moment, in essence, all  Russia's Armed Forces are in motion: The troops' withdrawal is  in progress, they are changing stations, their structure is  changing, expenditure on the provision of facilities is  increasing. It takes 55 trains just to move one motorized  infantry division. You can imagine the other expenses that this  entails. And maintaining military camps beyond the Urals, which  is where a significant proportion of troop units and formations  have been redeployed, is much more expensive than in the  European part of the former USSR. The Finance Ministry also  takes no account of the actual tasks tackled by the Russian Army  and Navy in the present difficult situation. But fulfilling  peacekeeping functions in the "hot spots" costs the Armed Forces  far more, of course, than systematic training in stationary  conditions. So we want just one thing: for Finance Ministry  workers to grasp once and for all the volume and structure of  the military budget, and not to try to mislead the government  about it every time.    [Ivanyuk] Another question that arises is: Why take as a  basis this bizarre figure of 5.02 percent -- with hundredths of  a percent -- of GDP? This comparison with last year would be  logical if last year's finances had been optimum, or at least  satisfactory. But that is not so. And defense funds were saved  in a manner directly detrimental to combat readiness. Because  of the fuel shortage, combat training plans were not met, planes  did not fly, ships lay rusting at the quayside, equipment did  not get repaired, housing was not built, food reserves were not  renewed, and so forth. And moreover, on the results of the  year, the Defense Ministry ended up a major debtor....    [Vorobyev] To this day we have yet to settle up with all  the suppliers of military equipment and property, supplies, and  services. Out of a debt which totaled R2.2 trillion at the  beginning of the year, only 1 trillion has been extinguished.  Overall, the Defense Ministry's minimum requirement for  appropriations of R10 trillion was only 75 percent fulfilled  last year, taking the repayment of debts into account. The  Finance Ministry could have achieved a still more gratifying  picture and a still lower proportional level of defense spending  this year if, last year, it had allocated not 75 percent, but,  say, 50 or 40 percent of what the Army and Navy needed. Let's  think straight: How much longer can the Armed Forces be kept  without money, with only insignificant sums being allocated  eight or 10 times a month, as has been the case for nearly a  year? For another six months? A year? And then what?    Some people declare that in the developed countries of the  West, military spending accounts for not more than 3-5 percent  of gross national product. Those who think this fail to take  account of one thing -- the actual volume of GNP in those  countries and in ours is not comparable. As a result the sums  allocated for defense are not comparable either. And it is not  a question of "flexing military muscles"; the point is that the  reform of the Russian Army and Navy should be carried out  gradually, without sociopolitical upheavals. Nor can we  disregard the country's geopolitical location, the role that  Russia continues to play in the world community, the structure  of the Armed Forces, and many other factors.    [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA interpolation] Our Information: In 1994  the U.S. GNP will be in excess of $6 trillion, and total  military expenditure will be $280 billion, which comes to about  $1,100 for every citizen of America. In the current year, total  military spending per capita will be $730 in Britain, $810 in  France, $815 in Norway, and $500 in Greece and the FRG.    [Vorobyev continues] It must also be taken into account that  ever since 1989, even while the Soviet Union still existed,  expenditure on defense has fallen every year, mainly through  reducing the numerical strength of the Army and Navy and cutting  purchases of arms and military equipment.    It would theoretically be possible to adopt the  appropriations included in the draft budget for 1994 at the  levels proposed by the Russian Finance Ministry. But the real  consequences of that step must be borne in mind. What does it  mean, for instance, if the Defense Ministry purchases 20-25  percent of the arms and military equipment stipulated in the  State Order for 1994? Not only a reduction in the troops'  combat capability and an irreversible lag in defense production  technology, but also the stoppage of many enterprises and a mass  upsurge in unemployment. Let us look at another item of  expenditure. Given the proposed level of finance for housing  construction, servicemen will fail to receive 24,000 apartments  planned in the State Defense Order for 1994. The number of  homeless families in the Army and Navy could rise to 155,000 by  the end of the year as a result. Need I continue the list?    I am convinced that everyone in the Russian Armed Forces,  from the defense minister to any private doing his compulsory  service, would agree to a devastating budget for the Army if he  knew that it would result in an economic miracle in the near  future. But miracles do not happen, and the only way to produce  any tangible results in terms of economic recovery is to add to  the income side of the budget, not to manipulate its expenditure  side. As for making economical use of the resources allocated,  we are prepared to make savings and we are doing everything to  that end.    [Ivanyuk] As you know, the Ministry of Labor recently put a  proposal to the government to increase the minimum wage by 40  percent from 1 March. The adoption of this decision will entail  an increase in wages in the budget sphere. Many of our readers  are worried: Could it turn out that the military will once  again be left to last? After all, last year it was the rule --  and this "rule" is regarded as an outrage -- to increase  servicemen's pay a month later, or to a lesser extent, than for  other "budget-funded" people.    [Vorobyev] I hope this will not happen. We have submitted  appropriate proposals regarding the indexation of servicemen's  pay and the wages of the Defense Ministry's civilian personnel,  and it would be nice to think that the proposals will be taken  fully into account. At the same time the concern that has  arisen in military collectives is understandable: Some people  are not above making savings even here, at the expense of the  soldier or the officer. Thus, in similar conditions the Finance  Ministry has twice tried to index-link only servicemen's pay,  "forgetting" about allowances for rank. But the Finance  Ministry is not the government, and the government did not  permit such "innovations." We have repeatedly been aware of  Prime Minister V.S. Chernomyrdin's support on these matters.  After all, our proposals are not based on excessive demands.  It would be possible to forget about incomplete indexation or  delays in it, if the soldier's job was among those that are  highly paid. But in reality the picture is different. Let us  take, for comparison, a pilot in civil aviation and a military  airman. They experience similar psychological and physical  stresses, they bear the same high responsibility. How does the  state value their labor? A captain at Sheremetyevo-2 gets up to  R3 million a month. That sum is made up of the salary, with the  addition of the sector coefficient and other supplementary  coefficients, additional payments for qualifications, unhealthy  working conditions, and length of service, bonuses, and other  payments, such as payments for total flying time per month, the  commander's minimum landing payment, payment for working  particularly difficult routes.... In the Russian Air Force a  plane's captain, a major and first-class pilot with 15 or more  years of service, receives something like R400,000 a month, that  is, between one-fifth and one-sixth as much. This includes  everything -- supplements for length of service, qualifications,  special conditions of service and material aid, and the lump sum  on the results of the year, calculated per month.    [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA interpolation] Our Information: In  1909-1917 a captain or company commander in the Russian Army  used to receive per year: salary -- R900, mess allowance --  R360, additional pay -- R480 (total: R1,740). In addition he  was paid a lodging allowance of up to R544 a year, expenses for  acquiring essential kit in field conditions and for the purchase  of a horse, harness, carriage, etc., batman money of R10, and  ration money (campaign and field rations in wartime). For a  captain, the campaign allowance was R1.57, and the field  allowance R3.50 per day.    According to the draft State Income and Expenditure  Inventory  for 1912, a worker's average wage was R244 a year.    At the beginning of the 20th century in Russia a kilogram of  bread cost 6-15 kopeks, meat 17-33 kopeks, sugar 37 kopeks,  butter 62-70 kopeks, a liter of vodka was 48-60 kopeks, a pair  of shoes R3, and a pair of boots R7.    [Vorobyev continues] Throughout the world, a soldier's work  is paid more highly than work requiring similar effort in  civilian sectors, and everywhere there is a highly developed  system of concessions. And this is easy to explain: A person  who is not bound by an oath or the requirements of military  regulations is free to change his job if something -- such as  the pay -- does not suit him. But where is a nuclear submarine  commander -- who, incidentally, receives no more than a fighter  pilot -- to go, if he does decide to sever his ties with the  military department, at great cost to himself? There should be  compensation for servicemen, in the form of higher wages, for  restrictions of this kind on civil rights. And for other  drawbacks -- the nomadic way of life, the lack of opportunity  for wives to find jobs, etc. It must be said that this approach  is enshrined in the Law on the Status of Servicemen, but in  practice, unfortunately, the law is not realized as it should be.    In terms of cost, the law has only been half implemented.  The reason is well known -- the relevant provisions of the law  are not backed up by an implementation mechanism, and  appropriations have not been allocated. In this connection we  receive many complaints from the troops and from Defense  Ministry pensioners, to which it is impossible to give a  satisfactory reply. Civil and military courts have recently  been issuing rulings practically every day in favor of  servicemen and Armed Forces veterans who appeal over violations  of their rights to privileges laid down in existing legislation.  But even the court decisions lead nowhere. To crown it all,  the mass media blame the defense minister and the services under  him for not fulfilling laws signed by the president of the  Russian Federation.    [Ivanyuk] But as if it was not enough that after more than a  year this law has not even become fully operational, there have  also been -- and still are -- attempts to "torpedo" it, to  revoke privileges for servicemen and their families, including  some that have existed for a long time. Just the other day  people in the Army were disturbed by the news that the Finance  Ministry has spawned yet another proposal for cutting  servicemen's privileges. The impression is that some people are  deliberately "inflaming" the atmosphere in the military  collectives....    [Vorobyev] First of all, I would like to stress that the  Army and Navy have no fabulous, extraordinary privileges -- in  the main they correspond to the system of benefits and  compensations that have become established in our country. For  instance, members of many professions receive free uniform, are  able to supplement their wardrobes at half price, enjoy free  travel to and from their vacation center or free food, or have  privileges under housing or, say, land legislation.    But for some reason there are proposals to repeal or suspend  the operation of certain laws, edicts, and decrees in connection  with social guarantees specifically for servicemen. Some of  these proposals can only be described as ludicrous. For  instance, it is proposed to retain the food ration, but anyone  who declines to take it, instead of being compensated for its  full value, would be paid compensation equivalent to one minimum  wage. But everyone will simply start taking the rations, and  that will considerably complicate the task of procuring,  storing, and issuing food and will entail additional costs.  That is why the prime minister, in his interview for a RIA  correspondent, described such proposals, bluntly but, I believe,  rightly, as "real blackmail."    [Ivanyuk] Vasiliy Vasilyevich, I cannot but agree with what  you say, so do not take the next question, which is rather  awkward, as an attempt to engage in a dispute. I have often  heard it said, even at high levels, that the stance of the  Defense Ministry, which is demanding to be fully financed in  conditions of an acute budget deficit, is unproductive and  inappropriate to a market economy. How would you comment on that  view?    [Vorobyev] I too have heard such views expressed. On the  one hand, they are rather superficial, and on the other, they do  not show good will. The theory that was once current, that  social problems in the Army and Navy could and should be tackled  by the use of extrabudgetary funds, has yet to bear fruit. The  actual return on the numerous funds set up in this context is  close to zero. And how can anyone seriously talk about  maintaining -- even partially maintaining -- the army of a vast  country like Russia on, so to speak, a voluntary basis? This is  the state's task, and the state should take care of it in full.  And a rigorous financial policy should be aimed at securing the  military budget as a priority, not at reducing it.    The Russian Defense Ministry is today placed within very  tight bounds and is virtually without the possibility of earning  resources. As an example, let me cite the sale of surplus  property, as a result of which 1,600 apartments were acquired  for servicemen last year. Yet on many other questions a far  stricter system of restrictions has been imposed than in foreign  states' armies, which are incomparably better financed. Thus,  for instance, in Turkey a huge entrepreneurial structure  operates under the patronage of the Armed Forces, including  dozens of enterprises, as well as banks, and this makes it  possible to provide additional social protection for servicemen.  There are dozens of other projects which could be implemented  in the Russian Armed Forces to rectify their financial position.  In this respect we are urgently studying possible options with  the Finance Ministry and other economic departments.    [Ivanyuk] It would be nice to think that everything you have  spoken of is at the center of the attention of the government  and parliamentarians as they set about examining the country's  budget for 1994, and that the Defense Ministry's interests will  all be taken into account.    [Vorobyev] We are hoping for that, too. Only I would make  one small reservation: The proposals we have submitted on the  military budget are dictated not by departmental interests, but  by concern for maintaining the country's defense capability at  least at the minimum necessary level. I would like to believe  that the State Duma, the Federation Council, and the government  understand this and will take account of all the circumstances  in making their final decision.</p>

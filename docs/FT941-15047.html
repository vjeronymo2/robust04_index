			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / GM move on Russian assembly plants General Motors, the US carmaker, has signed a memorandum of understanding with VAZ, the Russian producer of Lada cars, which could eventually lead to the assembly of GM cars in Russia. The two companies have agreed to conduct a feasibility study into the production of the Opel/Vauxhall Corsa small car at the VAZ assembly plant at Togliatti. GM Europe said yesterday that the initial study should be completed by the spring. The study will examine the suitability of the Opel Corsa for the Russian market and the economic feasibility of producing the car in Russia. Officials from the two companies met last week in Paris, and it is expected that the study team will be led by GM's Opel technical development centre at Russelsheim near Frankfurt. The Opel/Vauxhall Corsa, which was launched in Europe a year ago, is built at GM's European plants at Zaragoza, Spain and at Eisenach in eastern Germany. It will also be produced at GM plants in Brazil and Mexico. Discussions between GM and VAZ are still at a very preliminary stage, but the US vehicle maker has developed close contacts with the Russian carmaker in recent years as a supplier of components. GM's Automotive Components Group Worldwide began shipping production parts for engine management systems to VAZ last summer.</p>

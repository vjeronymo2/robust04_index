			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 23 KYODO -- The value of office-computer  shipments fell for the third year in a row in the business year  ended March 31, dropping 17 percent from the previous year to  508.2 billion yen, the Japan Electronic Industry Development  Association said Monday [23 May].    In volume, shipments also shrank for the third consecutive  year, falling 16 percent to 140,254, it said.    Association officials said the prolonged recession made  corporations refrain from investing in office-use computers.    Such companies tended to buy personal computers or  workstations instead, they said.    The association said shipments of office computers declined  for all levels, including small business computers costing less  than 3 million yen and large machines with a price of 10 million  yen or more. By industrial sector, shipments to the financial  industry jumped 35 percent in value and 19 percent in the number  of units. The steady rise was attributable to a massive order  from an insurance company, the association said.    Shipments to the public sector rose 4 percent in volume, but  those to all other sectors declined from a year earlier, it said.</p>

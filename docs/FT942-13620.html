			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Outdoors: FT Round the World Ski Expedition Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are trying to ski every day of 1994 on a round-the-world expedition. They began the year in North America and are now in Europe. Arnie reports: Is the sun never going to shine again? Or is this some kind of nuclear winter? In Switzerland we were battered by one of the worst blizzards I have witnessed in 20 years of skiing. But the good snow enabled us to make an assault on our record of 26 miles for a single day's skiing, set in February in Keystone, Colorado. The staff of Ski Scott Dunn, our hosts in Champery, joined us, all dressed in pink and black, and together we jetted 30 miles around the Portes du Soleil. Lucy's lesson in powder skiing from Ueli Frei, president of the Grindewald Guides Association, proved timely, for over the next three or four days, thigh deep powder - on and off the piste - was just about all there was. In Villars, we made the mistake skiers dread: we skied down to a closed lift and had to walk all the way up again. Now we are in France, I will no longer have to struggle with Italian or German to find out when the lifts close. Lucy can do the talking. There is still time to win a skiing holiday for two by entering the competition which appeared in Weekend FT on April 2 (copies available from the FT shop, tel: 071-873 3324).</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A responsible source has stated the following:    Despite the patience we have demonstrated and the  concessions  we have made out of our concern to preserve unity and democracy  and the country's safety and security, and despite the signing  of the Pledge and Accord document in the Jordanian capital,  Amman, two and one- half months ago -- a document whose signing  was supposed to end the crisis and to signal the beginning of  its implementation -- the secessionist gang in the leadership of  the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], led by war criminal al-Bid and  his secessionist gang, which is rebelling against Constitutional  legitimacy, has insisted on continuing the crisis it created,  refusing to even appear before the House of Representatives to  take the Constitutional oath. This gang has prevented the  convening of official institutions within Constitutional  legitimacy and went so far as to start a series of painful and  bloody clashes between the comrades-in-arms of the Yemeni  people. This began with the attack on the al-'Amaliqah forces  in Abyan, besieging the citizens in Mudiyah, creating sedition  in the (Harth Sifiyan), and intentional provocations in Shabwah  and Dhamar, and finally starting the horrible and disastrous  fighting between the Third and First Armored Brigades at the  'Imran military camp.    The secessionist gang in the YSP leadership was not  satisfied  with creating these disasters and tragedies, perhaps because  this gang has not yet lost hope of carrying out its suspect and  evil plot. This gang has brought the military situation to this  degree of seriousness in total disregard of the possible threats  to the country. Its blind hatred has covered everything in the  country, including the land and the people, and the state and  its achievements. The gang started an all-out war on the evening  of the sad and gory Wednesday in all parts of Yemen. This began  at 2005 with an attack against the Presidential Guard battalion  in Dhamar and the siege and attack with all kinds of weapons  against the Central security detachment in Aden. The same  night, they carried out a comprehensive attack against the units  of the 2d Armored Brigade in the al-Rahah area in the Lahij  Governorate, and sent the Air Force to strike vital and  strategic targets in Sanaa, al-Hudaydah, and Ta'izz.    Thus, the YSP tyrants, led by the traitor al-Bid and his  secessionist, criminal gang, have indulged their hatred to its  utmost by attacking the people, the homeland, unity, and  democracy, prompted by the grotesque megalomania of their  secretary general, al-Bid. This is a flagrant rebellion against  Constitutional legitimacy and high treason to the homeland and  humanity. Thus, the people will never forgive them. They will  bear the curse of God and history. They will face the severest  punishment. Their final fate will be the darkness of their  graves.    As for the heroes of the Armed and Security Forces, the  protectors of unity and democracy, they will be held high by the  support of our struggling people in the epic of pride and glory.  With their chaste blood and sacred sacrifices, they are writing  bright pages of decisive victory for the homeland, the people,  unity, democracy, justice, and prosperity, God willing.    If you will help the cause of Allah, he will help you and  plant your feet firmly. [Koranic verse]</p>

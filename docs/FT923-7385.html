			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Arts: Twilight of the Wagner family? - Andrew Clark considers the future role, if any, of the Wagner family in running the Bayreuth Festival, and details the squabble over the succession to Wolfgang Wagner as director IS THERE a future for the Wagner family at Bayreuth? An improbable question, you might say, considering the two have been synonymous for more than a century. But while the composer himself is always likely to remain the centrepiece of the festival he founded, the role to be played by his descendants is suddenly being called into question. The German press this summer has given extensive coverage to a series of personal attacks on Wolfgang Wagner - long-established festival director and grandson of the composer - emanating from the next generation of the family, none of whom Wolfgang has allowed to work at the Festspielhaus. Rifts and quarrels within the Wagner family are nothing new, and discussion about a successor to Wolfgang - who turns 73 at the end of this month - has been simmering for some years. But this is the first time younger members of the family have launched a concerted public campaign against Wolfgang and his style of management. They feel shut out. Wolfgang is portrayed as a greedy old tyrant under whom the festival has lost its creative energy and fallen prey to commercial pressures. The implication is that it is time he made way for new blood. Several of the composer's 12 great-grandchildren are nearing 50. They are becoming impatient. Wolfgang, who has unwavering support from artists and most of the festival public, says there is no dynastic 'right of succession'. The family name alone is no longer sufficient qualification to manage a large and complex operation such as the Bayreuth Festival. Members of the next generation must prove their ability elsewhere first - something he believes they have failed to do. Wolfgang says: 'And 'To bring in as a colleague anyone who so vehemently criticises me and my work would poison the atmosphere for all who work here.' Bayreuth-watchers say it is increasingly likely that when Wolfgang goes, someone from outside the family will take over. When Wolfgang and his elder brother Wieland resurrected the festival from its post-war ruins in 1951, they made a clean break with its Nazi past. Wieland was the artistic genius, but Wolfgang's practical management skills ensured that the festival had the wherewithal to thrive. Since Wieland's premature death in 1966, Wolfgang has run the festival single-handed, opening it to a broad range of nationalities and styles, laying the groundwork for its long- term survival. In 1973 he and his mother Winifred established the Richard Wagner Foundation  -consisting largely of representatives of public funding bodies - with the aim of preserving the festival's independence and protecting it from family in-fighting. All festival property now belongs to the foundation, in which the Wagner family has a minority vote. Under the rules of the foundation, when the post of festival director falls vacant, a successor must first be sought from within the family. If the family cannot agree by majority decision on a candidate within four months, or if 'other more suitable candidates should present themselves', the foundation will consult a three-member commission chosen from the general administrators of the six main German-language opera houses. Whoever is appointed (probably on a fixed-term contract) will have overall responsibility for the festival, but considerably less power than Wolfgang. There is no doubt that the festival draws much of its character from the presence of a member of the Wagner family at its centre. Wolfgang is steeped in Bayreuth tradition, he knows his grandfather's works inside out and he has a knack of discovering new talent. His avuncular presence pervades the Festspielhaus at all times. He wants to do all he can to ensure that his life's work is not destroyed by an irresponsible successor. In private, Wolfgang does not seem bitter towards the next generation: he simply feels they have not grasped what running the festival entails. Wolf-Siegfried Wagner, Wieland's 49-year old son and a sharp critic of Wolfgang's production style, claims it is his birthright to work at Bayreuth, but has made little headway in his own career as an independent stage director. His 47-year old sister Nike alleges Wolfgang has barred her from consulting festival archives for a book she is writing on its postwar history, and says Bayreuth should widen its remit to include musical experiments, 'ideological debate' and the works of 20th century composers like Schoenberg and Henze. Gottfried Wagner, Wolfgang's 45-year old son, has accused him of employing Jewish conductors like Daniel Barenboim and James Levine in order to draw a veil over the festival's anti-semitic past. Banned by his father from entering the Festspielhaus for the past two years, Gottfried gives lectures on Bayreuth's Nazi history, and has been quoted as saying the music of Meyerbeer and other Jews vilified by Wagner should be performed at Bayreuth. Notable for her silence is Wolfgang's 47-year old daughter Eva, who currently holds a senior management post at the Opera Bastille in Paris. Members of the festival's Friends Organisation see her as the sole hope for the family succession. But she and her father barely communicate - apparently because of the influence exerted by Wolfgang's 48-year old second wife Gudrun, who arrived as an employee in the press office in the 1960s and now plays a key role in festival administration. Eva worked in the Festspielhaus when she was younger, but left soon after Wolfgang married Gudrun. 'Secretly Wolfgang probably wants Eva to succeed him,' observes one Bayreuth insider, 'but showing favouritism would create hell at home. Gudrun has never been accepted by the family, they feel usurped by her. She's hard-working and ambitious, and probably fuels his animosity towards them. As long as he reigns, the queen will be queen.' Wolfgang's refusal to do anything to influence the succession means there will be a huge upheaval and power struggle when he goes. The quickest solution would be for the foundation to appoint Eva - who would probably bring in a part-time artistic director (as Winifred Wagner did in the 1930s) and try to ride out family jealousies. Alternatively, to maintain short-term continuity, the foundation could opt for an uncontroversial outsider to work in harness with Gudrun: with Cosima Wagner and Winifred to look back on, the festival has a history of young wives inheriting the mantle of power. Or the Wagnerian decks could be cleared altogether and the festival put in the hands of an experienced German opera intendant. But that is pure speculation. Wolfgang is too wily and popular to have anything to fear from the younger generation. He is in good health and is busy supervising production plans for the next two summers. He likes to quote Fafner's words from The Ring, 'Ich lieg und besitz' (I'll keep what I hold). For the time being, Bayreuth's detractors and the German press are simply enjoying another chapter in the long-running Wagner family soap opera.</p>

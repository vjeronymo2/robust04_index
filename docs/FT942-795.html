			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Nasa space station at risk: House may force agency to abandon Dollars 30bn project The House of Representatives could this week move to force the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to abandon its Dollars 30bn (Pounds 19.3bn) space station project. The project last year survived by a single vote in the House. The Clinton administration is predicting a more comfortable margin this year, but congressional opponents claim they have the votes to kill the project outright. The House appropriations sub-committee has proposed cuts of Dollars 240m in Nasa's budget for fiscal 1995, but has left the space station budget intact, at around Dollars 2.1bn. Nasa has requested a total budget of Dollars 14.3bn for 1995. The sub-committee is instead proposing cuts of Dollars 127m to the space shuttle programme, Nasa's manned space flight project. The shuttle will fly eight missions next year instead of the scheduled nine, and has postponed or abandoned plans to upgrade some its hardware. However, in the House vote, which could take place as early as today, opponents to the station are likely to introduce an amendment to kill the planned space station completely. The amended bill would then go to the Senate, where within the next two weeks, the Senate sub-committee, in its parallel consideration, is likely to recommend cuts of up to Dollars 600m in Nasa's budget. Mr Daniel Goldin, Nasa administrator, whose agency has taken a 30 per cent budget cut over the past two years, this month pleaded with senators not to slash the Nasa budget again. But because the quirky Congressional appropriations process forces Nasa to compete for funds with the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, both of which have large budgetary mandates, Nasa will probably have to bear a heavy burden. Any reconciliation of the amendment to abandon the station from the House and the proposed cuts of Dollars 600m from the Senate would be likely to mean the end of the space station. 'I don't know how to logically cut and maintain the balance,' Mr Goldin said, when pressed by the senators on how Nasa would deal with a worst-case scenario budget of Dollars 13.7bn. 'If we have to go below (Dollars 14bn), we could lose either a space station or we could lose a major science mission.' Many on Capitol Hill think losing the space station is exactly what Nasa needs. A report issued in March by the Congressional Budget Office - Congress's independent budget authority - concluded that Nasa would be unable to keep the space station within budget, and another one issued last year by the General Accounting Office, the government audit agency, reported that Nasa had underestimated costs on 25 of its 29 large projects. There is also an 'anti-big science' atmosphere in Congress, where many believe the applications from projects such as the space station are too far removed from everyday reality. 'This space station will cost far more than its sticker price and will continue to displace more cost-effective space research,' said Representative Dick Zimmer, a New Jersey Republican who will lead the charge against the station along with Representative Timothy Roemer, an Indiana Democrat. 'It's a case of too much money for not enough science.' The station will study the effect of gravity on humans, to enable further space exploration, and will undertake a number of micro-biological and medical experiments, with the aim of producing new vacc ines. The station has so far cost around Dollars 10bn and legislators report Nasa's public relations machine is in high gear as the agency attempts to save the space station from being blasted away before it ever gets a chance to blast off.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart B_Standards for Participation in the Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 668.13&blank;Certification Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Period of participation. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to concerns of many commenters about the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consequences (particularly the potential for provisional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification) to a participating institution in the event that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Secretary does not complete a review of the institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application prior to the expiration of the institution's program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation agreement, even if the institution had filed its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> renewal application in a timely manner, &sect;668.13(b) is amended to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide that full certification will be extended on a month to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> month basis following the expiration of a program participation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreement where the institution's application for recertification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was materially complete, and submitted at least 90 days prior to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the expiration date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Provisional certification. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to public comment, proposed &sect;668.13(c)(1)(ii)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that provided that the Secretary may provisionally certify an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution if the financial responsibility and administrative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capability of the institution was being determined for the first  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time has been deleted from these regulations. Although this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision is statutory, the Secretary has decided that the other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards requiring the use of provisional certification are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adequate to identify institutions that would be captured by this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision where greater monitoring and procedural restrictions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 668.13(c)(2)(i) has been amended to clarify the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maximum permissible length of periods of provisional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification. Upon further consideration, the Secretary has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decided to repeat the language of the statute that provides that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> periods of participation under provisional certification should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be for ``complete award years.'' So, for example, the regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will permit the Secretary to provisionally certify an initial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicant for one complete award year, rather than for a period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of 12 months as proposed in the February 28, 1994 NPRM. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will provide the Secretary with a complete award year of data on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which to base determinations of further participation for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to public comment, &sect;668.13(d)(1) that lists the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements for provisional certification to participate on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limited basis for institutions that are not financially  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsible has been amended to make clear that the criteria of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this section are not required for an institution that meets the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceptions to the general standards of financial responsibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under &sect;668.15(d).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to public comment &sect;668.13(d)(1)(ii) has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amended to clarify that any required submission of a letter of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> credit must be in an amount and in a form acceptable to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;668.13(d)(1)(iii)(B) has been revised, consistent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with similar changes in &sect;668.15(b) (3) and (4), to make clear how  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an institution demonstrates that it has met all of its financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obligations and is current in its debt payments. This provision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is explained in greater detail in the section of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Analysis of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments and Changes <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  that addresses the factors of financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility (&sect;668.15).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to public comment, &sect;668.13(d)(2) has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clarified to explain that financial guarantees are only required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if the institution comes within the requirements of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;668.15(c)(2), or where the institution fails to demonstrate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial responsibility under its current audit and has failed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to do so at least one other time under the standards in effect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during the preceding five years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to public comment, a new paragraph (e) is added  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to &sect;668.13 which provides for denial of certification to initial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicants for participation in a Title IV, HEA program and to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participants that have undergone a change of ownership resulting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in a change of control, if the State in which those applicants or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participants are located does not participate in the State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Postsecondary Review Program. This addition conforms these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations to the requirements of the State Postsecondary Review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Program in 34 CFR part 667, and provides some further explanation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the consequences to an institution if the State in which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution is located does not participate in the State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Postsecondary Review Program. Under paragraph (e), the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may provisionally certify a participating institution or branch  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> campus in that State. Section 668.13(c)(2)(ii) has also been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revised to provide that the provisional certification of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution under these circumstances expires at the end of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third complete award year following the date of the provisional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to public comment, a change has been made to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide for notices of revocation of provisional certification to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be sent by certified mail, instead of registered mail.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to public comment, &sect;668.13(f)(4)(i) has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modified to provide that the official reviewing a request for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reconsideration of provisional certification must be different  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from, and not subject to supervision by, the official that issued  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the notice of revocation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 668.14&blank;Program Participation Agreement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to public comment, &sect;668.14(b)(1) has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amended to clarify that an institution must comply with all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> special arrangements, agreements, or limitations entered into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the authority of statutes applicable to Title IV of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HEA. Corresponding changes have been made throughout the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sections of 34 CFR part 668 and 34 CFR part 682 contained in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory package.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to public comment, &sect;668.14(b)(4) has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amended to provide that an institution must provide information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relating the administrative capability and financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility of the information to a SPRE only if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution was referred by the Secretary under 34 CFR 667.5.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed regulations prohibited any type of incentive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments, particularly those based on ``retention.'' In response  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to public comment, the Secretary has amended &sect;668.14(b)(22) to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allow that token gifts may be given to students or alumni for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> referring other students for admission to the institution, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> long as:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The gift is not money, check or money order;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) No more than one such gift is given to any student or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alumnus; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The value of the gift is no more than twenty-five  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dollars.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to public comment, proposed &sect;668.16(k) that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires that an institution: (1) Demonstrate a reasonable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relationship between the length of the program and occupational  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entry level requirements and (2) establish the need for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> training has been moved to &sect;668.14(b)(26). Further, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of this provision have been amended to require an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution to demonstrate a reasonable relationship between the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> length of the program and occupational entry level requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established by any Federal agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

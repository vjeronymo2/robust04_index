			<p><P> March 13, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> POLICE OVERUSED STUN GUNS, WORKERS SAY;  </P> <P> LAW ENFORCEMENT: HOSPITAL EMPLOYEES CONTEND THAT A PATIENT WHO LATER DIED WAS  JOLTED MANY MORE TIMES THAN OFFICERS ADMIT. A CORONER'S INVESTIGATION IS  CONTINUING.  </P> <P> A Ventura County coroner's report released Monday sharply contradicts the  Ventura Police Department's version of events preceding the death last month of  a 24-year-old psychiatric patient who was shocked repeatedly with electric stun  guns.  </P> <P> Police said Duane Johnson of Oxnard was jolted four times with the weapons  before his death. But, according to the coroner's report, two mental-health  workers told county investigators that stun guns were used from seven to 11  times on the man during the 45 minutes before his death.  </P> <P> The workers, who witnessed the incident, maintained that officers shocked  Johnson at least six times with a stun gun after they gained control of him in  his hospital room Feb. 13, according to the report by coroner's investigators.  </P> <P> The workers complained that the patient, tethered face-down on a gurney, was  unnecessarily shocked with the weapons as officers moved him from his room at  Ventura County Medical Center to a county psychiatric facility nearby.  </P> <P> Johnson, who was in the hospital because of a near-fatal heart attack two weeks  before his death, was "restrained and not a threat to himself or others," one  worker told investigators.  </P> <P> Officers continued to apply a stun gun to Johnson because he ignored their  commands not to grab for hospital workers who were accompanying him to the  mental facility, the workers said.  </P> <P> Police have maintained that Johnson, a muscular former athlete, was shocked  once with a small Nova stun gun by Officer Lynn Klamser and three times with a  larger Taser weapon by Sgt. George Morris.  </P> <P> Both weapons fire electrical charges of about 50,000 volts, which police say is  similar to a jolt received when an automobile spark plug wire is touched.  </P> <P> The weapons were used, police said, to force the patient to release his grip on  a glass medical instrument during the initial struggle in the hospital room  and, a few minutes later, to force him to release a hospital worker's leg.  Johnson's hands were handcuffed to the gurney railing, but he was able to move  his arms parallel to the rails.  </P> <P> The Taser was applied twice more when Johnson refused to be handcuffed while  being moved from the gurney into an isolation room, police said. He died about  45 minutes after the incident began and at least five minutes after the final  Taser jolt, police said.  </P> <P> Officers using the stun guns were unaware of Johnson's heart problems, police  Lt. Michael J. Tracy said Monday.  </P> <P> "We stand by the account we made previously," Tracy said, responding to the  coroner's report. "We've completed our investigation and sent it to the  district attorney, and now it's up to him to review various reports and do  what's appropriate."  </P> <P> The district attorney's office has refused to comment on the case until its  investigation is concluded.  </P> <P> The Police Department, after an investigation by homicide detectives, cleared  the four officers in the Johnson incident, Tracy said. Hospital and  mental-health employees interviewed by police supported the officers' version  of events, he said.  </P> <P> Department policy allows officers to use stun guns -- which are considered a  non-lethal alternative to nightsticks and firearms -- to control people who  pose a threat to officers or to the public. They also can be used to force  crime suspects to comply with officers' instructions.  </P> <P> County Coroner F. Warren Lovell said he had not yet determined whether shocks  from the stun guns were the cause of Johnson's death, or if they contributed to  it.  </P> <P> "This case is going to be a tough call," the coroner said. "This man had so  many other things wrong with him."  </P> <P> Johnson had chronic heart disease and probably would have died Jan. 28 of a  severe cardiac arrhythmia, or irregular heartbeat, had he not already been a  patient at the mental-health facility, about 300 feet from the medical center's  emergency room, Lovell said.  </P> <P> Johnson's "fighting and struggling" during the incident two weeks later put  additional stress on his heart, the coroner said.  </P> <P> But, according to the coroner's investigative report, at least one police  officer may have applied the stun weapons to Johnson in durations longer than  the one- to two-second bursts reported by police. Departmental policy calls for  such short applications.  </P> <P> One mental-health worker, Ferris D. Grubb, told investigators that when  officers transferred Johnson to the isolation room, one held a Taser to his  shoulder blades "the entire time" it took to bring his rigid arms from his side  to behind his back for handcuffing, according to the report.  </P> <P> "Mr. Grubb did not feel this was necessary and told the officers. . . . They  did not respond," coroner's investigator Dale E. Zentzis said in the report.  </P> <P> Lt. Tracy agreed that Morris kept the Taser on Johnson's back during the  handcuffing, but said he took his finger off the trigger after two separate  bursts of one or two seconds.  </P> <P> Wayne Flick, the second health worker, also said he thought the officers'  repeated use of the Taser was unnecessary, Zentzis said.  </P> <P> Lovell said that "prolonged application of the Taser would certainly contribute  to the problem. The question now is how much did he get. . . . That's crucial."  But, with the contradictory accounts, "I don't know if we're ever going to know  the truth," he said.  </P> <P> Johnson's death is the second in three years in Ventura County that has  followed the use of stun guns by police officers.  </P> <P> In 1987, Lovell found that jolts from a small Nova stun gun contributed to the  death of a Port Hueneme man who died of heart failure while intoxicated with  cocaine. Police had been called when the man barricaded himself in his bedroom  with his girlfriend's two children.  </P> <P> The district attorney's office found that the officers had acted according to  their training and violated no law.  </P></p>

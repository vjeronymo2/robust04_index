			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): London coffee market in retreat WHEN COFFEE prices rebounded from early lows on Tuesday, traders at the London Commodity Exchange were under no illusions that the retreat from recent 2 1/2 -year highs was over. 'The market looks very weak,' one told the Reuter news agency, 'it should, by rights, move lower.' His worlds proved prophetic. Tuesday's low of Dollars 1,235 a tonne for the November robusta futures position was quickly left behind and expected psychological support level at Dollars 1,200 a tonne gave way without a struggle. By yesterday's close the November contract was quoted at Dollars 1,160 a tonne, down Dollars 104 on the week and Dollars 175 below the late-August high. The irony is that this week's plunge came as producers were counting the hours to yesterday's commencement of their much-vaunted scheme to withhold 20 per cent of production from the market, which had been largely responsible for the July-August rally that lifted the November position by more than Dollars 400 a tonne, or 46 per cent. As is often the case, the market's confidence in the plan began to wane as the moment of truth approached. 'The retention plan's positive implications have been fully absorbed,' said Mr Lawrence Eagles, commodities analyst at GNI, the London trade house, after Wednesday's Dollars 59 fall. 'And investors are now beginning to wonder how effective it will be and how long it will last.' For his own part he thought the producers' resolve was strong and that the scheme would operate 'for a few years at least'. After an edgy week the cocoa market ended on an upbeat, with the December position, which had see-sawed between Pounds 892 and Pounds 940, closing yesterday at Pounds 936 a tonne, up Pounds 20 on balance. Meanwhile, the March 1994 contract, the new second position, rose to Pounds 969 a tonne breaking, though hardly decisively, chart-based resistance at Pounds 967, the long-time high for the second position reached in May 1990. Tempering cocoa traders' enthusiasm, however, was the knowledge that some of this week's rise, reflected a decline in sterling against the US dollar. In late trading yesterday the March futures position at New York's Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange was trading at Dollars 1,228 a tonne, up Dollars 19 on the week. Copper, the London Metal Exchange's flagship contract, led its convoy into shallower waters this week as, following the recent ending of the supply squeeze that had been propping up nearby prices, bearish fundamentals for the metal continued to drain market confidence. The three-months position closed yesterday at Dollars 1,699.25 a tonne, Dollars 36.25 above Thursday's six-year low but still Dollars 67.25 down on the week. Dealers said the late rally, which came despite news of big rise in LME warehouse stocks, was in reaction against an oversold market situation. The dismal performance of the copper market seemed to knock what little stuffing they had out of the tin and nickel markets. Both had staged quite spirited rallies last week, following four week's of heavy losses. But this week saw the two metals' bearish fundamentals reasserting themselves. What dealers described as a 'mini-collapse' on Monday wiped out Dollars 75 of three-months tin's Dollars 250 rally, and as persistent selling by the US Defence Logistics Agency revealed a paucity of buying interest the price subsided further to end Dollars 190 down at Dollars 4,437.50 a tonne. The Dollars 150 nickel rally had been encouraged by news that Inco of Canada, the biggest producer, was talking to unions about production cuts in an effort to reduce costs after the three-months price slumped below the critical Dollars 2 a lb mark. But as further details were awaited LME stocks, already at a record level, continued their relentless rise and the price fell to a fresh 6 3/4 -year low - the gloom being deepened by a forecast suggesting that the expected Russian output decline might be significantly less than western producers had been hoping for. At yesterday's close three-months nickel was at Dollars 4,112.50 a tonne, up Dollars 20 on the day but Dollars 277.50 down on the week. The gold price price continued to move in inverse proportion to the dangers perceived to attend the Russian parliament crisis, and after an edgy week it closed in London yesterday at Dollars 355.20 a troy ounce, down Dollars 2.05 on balance. For the oil market Geneva was the focus of attention as the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries met this week to set supply quotas for the coming six months. The consensus among oil traders seems to be that the agreed ceiling if 24.52m barrels a day, together with the inclusion of Kuwait (which had stayed out of the last deal), was about as much as could realistically have been hoped for, and prices regained some of the recent losses. In late trading yesterday at London's International Petroleum Exchange the North Sea Brent crude futures contract for December delivery was quoted at Dollars 17.55 a barrel, up Dollars 1.03 on the week. This week's Opec-related trading boost put the finishing touches to a bumper month for the IPE, with total turnover moving 8.7 per cent ahead of the July record to 1.387m barrels. An exchange official said yesterday it was particularly encouraging to see the IPE contract being used increasingly by Middle East producers to hedge forward sales, at the expense of the New York Mercantile Exchange's West Texas intermediate contract.  ------------------------------------ LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  ------------------------------------ Aluminium    +11,100 to 2,201,725 Copper       +10,500 to   601,725 Lead          unchgd at   287,525 Nickel        +2,262 to   117,930 Zinc          +4,125 to   801,775 Tin              -90 to    21,085  ------------------------------------</p>

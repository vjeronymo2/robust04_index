			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / US seeking 'African solution' in Somalia SOMALIA'S rebel warlord, Gen Mohamed Farah Aideed, and UN soldiers observed an uneasy truce in Mogadishu yesterday, as President Bill Clinton's special envoy arrived to mediate an end to the fighting. Mr Robert Oakley, the former diplomat sent by Mr Clinton, flew in after a stopover in Addis Ababa, where he got a pledge from Ethiopian President Meles Zenawi to work for peace in Somalia. In Washington, Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said the US was 'going to try to use the African leaders' assistance to try and devise an African solution to an African problem' - echoing a formulation adopted the day before by Mr Clinton. But US policy on whether to involve Gen Aideed in these talks appeared to be confused, or at best artfully nuanced. Mr Christopher yesterday said he would like Mr Meles to set up an independent commission to investigate Mr Aideed's involvement in attacks which killed 24 United Nations peacekeepers, adding that Mr Oakley's instructions did not include any direct contact with Gen Aideed. At the same time, he and other US officials refused to rule out participation by Gen Aideed in peace talks or in a future Somali government. Mr Christopher said the US had not received the ceasefire offer Gen Aideed was reported this weekend to have made in an address on his clandestine radio. 'I think that is just Gen Aideed's way of announcing a unilateral stand-down,' Mr Christopher said. Mr Les Aspin, the US defence secretary, meanwhile, said the US was not actively hunting Gen Aideed, but would not rule out the possibility of seizing him. 'If a target of opportunity were to present itself I'm not going to say we wouldn't take advantage and capture Aideed,' he said. However, if peace talks do begin, it is unlikely that the US would be able to avoid dealing with Gen Aideed, or at least with representatives of his Haber Gedir clan. Gen Aideed controls most of the capital, and believes that his militias' victory in toppling the Siad Barre dictatorship in 1991 earned him the right to become Somalia's next president. His presidency would be bitterly opposed by Somalia's 14 other main clans, despite the signing of a peace accord which halted their warfare in March. Mr Ali Mahdi Mohamed, a former hotelier who leads a faction controlling north Mogadishu, is Gen Aideed's rival for the presidency. Mr Mahdi says he has handed all his weapons to UN peacekeepers, and has generally given the multinational force little trouble. He may now be hoping to reap some tangible political rewards for good behaviour. Most of the 133 Norwegian soldiers serving with the UN in Somalia have resigned, saying their pay is too low for such a dangerous job, Norway's Defence Command said yesterday. It said 117 of the 133, from privates to majors, had signed a letter saying they were terminating their contracts. They were already were due to leave Somalia towards the end of the month, and their contracts demanded 30 days' notice of resignation.</p>

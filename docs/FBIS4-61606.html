			<p>BFN     [Text] Today, Eduard Shevardnadze, the chairman of the  Georgian Supreme Council and head of state, met Bundestag Deputy  Hans Jochen Vogel, the leader of a social democratic faction,  Genrod (Erlecht), a scientific assistant from the social  democratic faction, Dr. Winfrid Weiss and Dr. Alfred (Kidol),  members of the (Friedrich Ebert) Foundation, Guenter Dalhoff,  the German ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary to  Georgia, and other officials.    Eduard Shevardnadze thanked the German Government and German  people on the whole for the support Georgia can feel from their  side. The head of state said that our country is facing two  problems: The Abkhaz-Georgian conflict and the grave economic  crisis. The disintegration of the former Soviet Union resulted  in wrecking economic links with Russia, Ukraine, and other  republics. Georgia found itself in a complete isolation. The  principal task today is to restore these links and establish  integrational contacts with leading world countries. The head  of state emphasized that although it is rather difficult to  solve the existing problems, Georgia has chosen a road of  economic reforms and democracy and will not step aside.    On behalf of the German people, Mr. Vogel greeted the head  of  state and thanked him for the reception. He said that it is  necessary to stay by a friend's side when he is in need. The  German Government well realizes this, but it also realizes that  the assistance it has granted to Georgia is not sufficient and  therefore, it welcomes our government's decision to restore  links with the republics of the former Soviet Union.  Business-like and open contacts do not mean that there will be  an element of discrimination, Mr. Vogel said.    At the end of the meeting, members of the German delegation  expressed hopes that peace will be established in Georgia soon  and the country will escape the existing problems.    The meeting was attended by Guram Muchaidze, the leader of  the Georgian Social democratic Party.</p>

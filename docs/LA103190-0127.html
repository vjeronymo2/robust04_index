			<p><P> October 31, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATEWIDE BAN TO BE SOUGHT ON WOOD SHINGLE ROOFING;  </P> <P> SAFETY: ASSEMBLYMAN ROOS VOWS TO SEEK ACTION ON THE FLAMMABLE MATERIAL. FIRE  OFFICIALS BLAME IT FOR MUCH OF THIS YEAR'S DESTRUCTION.  </P> <P> A key California lawmaker vowed Tuesday to seek a statewide ban on flammable  wood roofs after hearing fire officials testify in Glendale about the  devastating losses that occurred this year during the state's worst brush fire  season.  </P> <P> So far during 1990, brush fires have destroyed a record 864 structures,  including more than 600 in Santa Barbara, Hal Walt, director of the California  Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, told the Joint Assembly/Senate  Committee on Fire, Police, Emergency and Disaster Services.  </P> <P> Fire officials blame much of the destruction on wood shingle roofs.  </P> <P> "In my 29-year career, shake shingle roofs, without a doubt, have contributed  more than any other cause" to the rapid spread of fire, said Riverside County  Fire Chief Glen Newman.  </P> <P> "I appreciate the consistency of comment," said Assembly Speaker Pro Tem Mike  Roos (D-Los Angeles), the committee's acting chairman. "There seems to be no  wavering. There will be an attempt by one of us on this committee to do  something about that next year."  </P> <P> Two state senators who serve on the committee and were present at the meeting  -- Alfred Alquist (D-San Jose) and Robert Presley (D-Riverside) -- expressed no  opinion about the effort to ban wood roofs.  </P> <P> Roos organized the hearing to determine how state lawmakers could help  firefighters in the wake of the disastrous fire season. In Southern California  alone, he said, brush fires caused three deaths, injured 53 people and  blackened more than 22,000 acres this year. "The final tally of property damage  may be over $300 million," he said.  </P> <P> The meeting was held in Glendale, where 64 houses were damaged or destroyed  June 27 in a fast-moving brush fire. About half of the houses had wood shingle  roofs, Glendale fire officials said.  </P> <P> The wood roof industry has lobbied against banning the material, claiming it  has been unjustly targeted by politicians and firefighters. They have also  claimed wood roofs can be treated effectively with fire-retardant chemicals. No  representatives from the industry attended the meeting.  </P> <P> Some cities, including Los Angeles, Beverly Hills, Glendale and now Santa  Barbara, prohibit shake roofs on new homes or as replacement roofs.  </P> <P> Glendale Fire Chief John Montenero recently called for a law that would force  homeowners to replace existing wood roofs. But a majority of City Council  members said they would not impose such a large expense on residents. At  Tuesday's hearing, Montenero urged state legislators to develop a low-interest  loan program to help homeowners pay for wood roof replacement.  </P> <P> The Santa Barbara and Glendale fires were ignited by arsonists who remain at  large, authorities said. State Fire Marshal James McMullen called for expanded  statewide arson investigation and prevention programs, funded by a surcharge on  insurance premiums.  </P> <P> After the hearing, however, Roos said the surcharge idea "kind of leaves me  cold" because high insurance costs have triggered widespread complaints among  Californians.  </P> <P> Roos said he did plan to follow up on a suggestion by fire officials that the  National Guard be activated more quickly to assist when a catastrophic fire  occurs.  </P> <P> At the end of the hearing, Rob Sharkey, president of the Glenmore Canyon  Homeowners Assn., urged the committee to investigate the actions of the  Glendale Fire Department in handling the June 27 blaze. In a report released  last week, the department said it left Glenmore Canyon, in which more than a  dozen houses were destroyed, unprotected for more than two hours while halting  the fire's spread on another front.  </P> <P> But the legislators said such a probe was outside their jurisdiction and urged  the association to present their concerns to Glendale city officials.  </P></p>

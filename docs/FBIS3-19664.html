			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] According to Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto,  Finland will immediately take a stance on its observer status in  the Western European Union, WEU, if Finland becomes a EU  [European Union] member. Finland's operations in NATO's  Partnership for Peace program, for their part, will extend  further than the planned peacekeeping training, Foreign Minister  Haavisto says. The agreement will be signed later in the  spring, and Finland will at that point give its own declaration.  Jarkko Juselius reporting:    [Begin recording] [Juselius] The building blocks for  Finland's security policy are slowly being gathered together in  different places. It is starting to look apparent that  Finland's observer membership of the Western European Union,  WEU, will be implemented fairly quickly if Finland becomes an EU  member. According to Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto, Finland  will take a stance on observer membership fairly quickly after  the possible membership [in the EU]. Will Finland be ready when  membership has been secured, or if it is secured, will Finland  be ready immediately after that to take measures to become an  observer member of the WEU?    [Haavisto] There are no decisions on this but we will  certainly take a stance, if and when membership starts.    [Juselius] Immediately?    [Haavisto] Fairly quickly after joining.    [Juselius] Foreign Minister Haavisto does not yet speak of  observer membership but Foreign Trade Minister Pertti  Salolainen, for his part, announced at the beginning of March  that he thinks it is fairly clear that Finland will become at  least an observer member of the WEU. [passage omitted]    [Juselius] According to Haavisto, at the agreement signing  ceremony Finland will present its own declaration on Finland's  Partnership for Peace aims.    [Haavisto] Yes, we will present our own declaration, where  we  will say that we are a partner giving help, making a  contribution to this peacekeeping cooperation.    [Juselius] Once more, when is this agreement going to be  signed?    [Haavisto] I cannot give you an exact date, but sometime in  the spring. [end recording]</p>

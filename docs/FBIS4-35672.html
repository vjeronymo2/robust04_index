			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Iranian Central Bank Governor Mohammad </F> Hoseyn 'Adeli by unidentified correspondent on 28 May; place not  given -- recorded]    [Excerpts] Dear viewers, as you heard in the bulletin,  following the announcement of the new decisions taken by the  committee for the regulation of the foreign exchange market --  which were adopted with the aim of limiting demand for foreign  exchange and controlling exchange rate fluctuations -- Mohammad  Hoseyn 'Adeli, the governor of the Central Bank, took part in an  exclusive interview with our reporter this evening. We end this  bulletin with this interview. Good night and may God keep.    [Correspondent] Please be so kind as to tell us about the  reasons behind the new decisions, announced last night, adopted  by Article Three, Clause 29 committee. [sentence as heard]    ['Adeli] In the name of God, the compassionate, the  merciful.  In view of the new possibilities established after the  negotiations that we carried out with our foreign commercial  partners, and in view of the fact that the banking system will  be able to open letters of credit, and the fact that the new  letters of credit issued during 1373 [beginning 21 March 94]  will be paid at the appropriate time -- and, again, in view of  the fact that we were also finding that some importers were  turning to the open market for foreign exchange and that this  was leading to an increase in the exchange rate, we came to the  conclusion that there was no longer any reason why -- bearing in  mind the new possibilities -- we should allow open market  transactions to raise the exchange rate. A new decision was  therefore adopted, according to which all importers will be able  to carry out their work in the normal way, that is, via the  banking system.    [Correspondent] Dr. 'Adeli, what difference, on the whole,  is  there between these new decisions and the previous ones?    ['Adeli] In fact, the new decisions represent no changes  from  the previous ones; it is rather the case that they are in line  with previous decisions, where the idea was that we should limit  demand on the open market for foreign exchange. These new  decisions are in keeping with that idea and, with these  decisions, a number of new ways have been foreseen for limiting  demand on the open market for foreign exchange. The new  decisions have two aspects: First, from now on all foreign  exchange transactions relating to imports into the country will  take place exclusively via the banking system and no one will be  allowed to go to the open market for their foreign exchange.  This is in line with the general policy that the government has  been following during recent months; that is, limiting demand on  the foreign exchange market.    The second aspect relates to the question of imports in  exchange for exports. Previously, this existed in a formal  sense only and, in reality, it was enough for an importer to  purchase an authorization for exports and then go to the open  market himself and buy foreign exchange. From now on, this  process will be ruled out and an importer will now either have  to purchase his foreign exchange from the banking system or he  must buy actual foreign exchange from an exporter; that is, as  long as an exporter's foreign exchange has not entered into the  banking system, the exporter will not be allowed to sell it. In  other words, the previous deposit slips that were bought and  sold before can only be sold now along with the actual foreign  exchange -- it will be actual foreign exchange that is bought  and sold. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] One of the points referred to in the recent  announcement of the new decisions was the issue of controlling  foreign exchange rate fluctuations. To what extent do you think  the new decisions will succeed in keeping the foreign exchange  rate under control?    ['Adeli] It seems to us that importers who previously  purchased foreign exchange on the market in order to send it  abroad will, henceforth, be prevented from carrying out their  transactions, because, if they buy foreign exchange on the open  market, their imported goods will not be cleared from customs.  Second, it has been stated that if someone buys foreign  exchange on the open market and sends it abroad, that will be  viewed as smuggling. In other words, sending foreign exchange  abroad other than via the banking system is henceforth  forbidden. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] We have had some talks with foreign parties  about rescheduling agreements. Will this prove useful and  effective in this process?    ['Adeli] Fundamentally, one of the reasons behind the new  decisions was that our rescheduling negotiations, fortunately,  proved successful. We have been able to obtain allowances for  the payment of our debts. From 1 June of the Christian year,  that is, in a few days from now, we will begin the first of a  series of payments, which will amount to about 4.5 billion marks  to German sellers. This has had a very good impact on banking  relations with foreign countries. Some insurance  establishments, such as Canadian insurance and Australian  insurance and some others have announced that they will accept  our letters of credit. This will, consequently prove to be a  new opportunity, both for the country and for importers. God  willing, they will be able to operate using the banking system.  I think that these are the positive effects of what we have  done.    [Correspondent] Thank you.</p>

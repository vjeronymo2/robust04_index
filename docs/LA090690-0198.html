			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPONSOR SCRAMBLES TO STOP FAN BOYCOTT;  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL: SAN DIEGO RESTAURATEUR FLOWN TO NEW YORK TO MEET WITH NBC AND  CBS, WHO SUSPEND PLANS TO SCRAMBLE GAMES.  </P> <P> Norman Lebovitz, a San Diego restaurateur who describes himself as "just the  average fan," was flown to New York Wednesday by one of the NFL's biggest  advertisers to meet with network executives about the scrambling of televised  games.  </P> <P> CBS and NBC later issued statements confirming that plans to scramble NFL  broadcasts have been suspended, at least for the foreseeable future.  </P> <P> Scrambling has become a dirty word to Lebovitz and thousands of other owners of  home and commercial satellite systems, who were stunned by the NFL's  announcement on Aug. 17 that, beginning with the start of the season Sunday,  the bulk of its games would be available only to network affiliates.  </P> <P> The news was especially upsetting to thousands of owners of restaurants and  sports bars, whose businesses were being helped greatly by being able to show a  full menu of NFL games every Sunday, as opposed to the one or two shown  locally. And fans in rural markets, who lack access to cable and free TV,  complained that they would be "frozen out" of the NFL's plans -- to use the  words of an irate congressman -- if scrambling was not reversed.  </P> <P> The practice of scrambling is the blocking by the originating network of the  normal televised feed. That is done via an electronic distortion of the picture  that makes it unwatchable. Prior to the recent plans by the networks,  individuals and business establishments with satellite dishes and specially  purchased decoding devises could unscramble the picture for their viewing.  </P> <P> The ensuing outcry led to a series of confusing announcements by the league and  the networks, which now say plans to scramble are indefinitely on hold.  </P> <P> It also led to the emergence of Lebovitz's grass-roots consumer effort, the  Assn. for Sports Fans' Rights, which last week launched a nationwide boycott of  Anheuser-Busch, Inc., one of the NFL's main sponsors.  </P> <P> And it reached a peak Tuesday night, when Lebovitz, whose chain of Sluggo's  specializes in hot dogs and hamburgers, was invited by the Miller Brewing Co.  -- his latest boycott target -- to be flown to New York to meet with network  executives.  </P> <P> The transplanted Chicagoan, who says, "They can do anything, but they can't  take away my Bears," said he met with NBC officials for an hour and with a CBS  official for 35 minutes.  </P> <P> Afterward, he said he was satisfied with the statement by NBC, which said it  lacked the technology to scramble in 1990, but angry with CBS, from which he  failed to get assurances "in plain English" that the network wouldn't scramble  before the end of the season.  </P> <P> As a result, Lebovitz said the boycott of Anheuser-Busch and Miller would  continue, with Sears Roebuck and Co. being added next week "unless there's a  stronger announcement."  </P> <P> "NBC assured us it would not scramble this year," Lebovitz said by phone from  New York. "But right now, I'm very frustrated with CBS. The meeting with NBC  went very well. They were articulate, well-groomed, nice people.  </P> <P> "But we're extremely disappointed in CBS. The young man we met with at CBS told  us there would be no scrambling by CBS, but only because it 'wishes to remain  competitive' with NBC. The bottom line is, they're not going to scramble, but  they refused to say it in English, so we walked out of the meeting. We're not  happy."  </P> <P> Asked why the networks agreed to such a meeting, Lebovitz said: "I guess they  wanted to size me up and decide what kind of a monster I am."  </P> <P> Ed Markey, a spokesman for NBC, confirmed his network's meeting with Lebovitz  and the outcome of the session -- that scrambling won't take place on NBC, at  least for the time being.  </P> <P> Sandy Genelius, a spokeswoman for CBS, confirmed her network's meeting with  Lebovitz, characterizing the motive as "an attempt to explain our position. We  gave him a copy of our statement . . . and that's about that."  </P> <P> Dave Fogelson, a spokesman for the Milwaukee-based Miller Brewing Co., said his  company arranged the meeting between Lebovitz and the networks to try and  "facilitate" a resolution to the controversy.  </P> <P> "In discussions with Norman, he indicated that he had wanted the help of the  Miller Brewing Co. to get the networks to listen to the concerns of his  association," Fogelson said. "And we agreed to arrange meetings for him with  CBS and NBC. We did not sit in on those meetings, nor did we indicate to Norman  what he was likely to hear from the networks."  </P> <P> Fogelson said late Wednesday that he was "surprised" to hear that Lebovitz had  continued the boycott, which executives at both Miller and Anheuser-Busch  admitted has had an impact.  </P> <P> "His stated objective was that if the networks met his objective of not  scrambling this year, he would end his boycott," Fogelson said. "And they have  done that. He wasn't talking 1991 and beyond; he was talking this season."  </P> <P> Asked if it were a little out of the ordinary for a fan and advocate to be  flown to Manhattan to meet with network brass in the carpeted suites of CBS and  NBC, Fogelson sighed and said: "The fact that the networks agreed to meet with  him indicated that they were concerned that we were concerned."  </P> <P> Lebovitz, 52, who moved to San Diego 5 1/2 years ago, said he retains season  tickets to the Chicago Bears' games. He said he attended every Bear home game  until he learned 3 1/2 years ago that satellite technology could bring all Bear  games into his living room in La Jolla -- or into his restaurants in LaJolla  and Hillcrest, which often draw large crowds for satellite showings of Cubs'  and Bears' games. He said that, "above all," he's motivated by the desire to  keep seeing those games, short of moving back to Chicago.  </P> <P> "If I end up having to do that, I will," he said. "I will see my Bears."  </P> <P> After the meetings, Lebovitz said he was convinced that both networks will be  "fully scrambled" by the start of the 1991 season, and that only Congress can  prevent it. And he said he was told by executives at both networks that after  the NFL's new $3.6-billion TV agreement expires in 1994, the league will  televise all games on a "pay-per-view" basis, at roughly $10 a game per  household.  </P> <P> "It's mind-boggling the power the NFL has over those networks," he said.  </P> <P> Officials at the networks and the NFL declined comment on Lebovitz's remarks  about pay-per-view.  </P></p>

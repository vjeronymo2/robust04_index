			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Ostanin] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 5 Jan -- A telephone conversation took place  this evening between Russian Defense Minister Army General Pavel  Grachev and U.S. Secretary of Defense Les Aspin. An agreement  on setting up a telephone hotline between the two countries'  defense ministers in order to hold consultations and exchange  opinions on defense and security issues was reached last  September during the official visit of the Russian minister to  the United States.    Yelena Agapova, the Russian defense minister's aide  responsible for public and press relations, told the ITAR-TASS  correspondent that in their telephone conversation the defense  ministers discussed a number of military-political issues of  mutual interest. More specifically, they exchanged views on the  prospects of bilateral cooperation in the military-political  sphere and agreed on a number of issues concerning the  preparations for the Russian-American command and staff exercise  of peacemaking troops, scheduled to be held in the summer of  1994 in the Privolzhskiy Military District.    At Les Aspin's request, Pavel Grachev set out his point of  view on questions of the possible expansion of NATO. "We support  a path which would lead to a truly all-European security  system," the Russian minister said. "We believe that security  and international stability should be inseparable and be backed  up by all-European structures." Regarding the question of  military cooperation between Russia and NATO, Pavel Grachev  noted that today it is being implemented on a bilateral basis  and within the framework of the North Atlantic Cooperation  Council. This includes questions of peacekeeping activity,  within the framework of which the possibility is being discussed  of preparing for and carrying out joint peacekeeping operations  under the aegis of the United Nations and the CSCE and training  military cadres to take part in peacekeeping operations.    "It is our hope that the `partnership for peace' concept,  proposed by the United States, will not lead to a broadening of  NATO detrimental to Russia's interests, but will help to  strengthen stability in Europe," Pavel Grachev stressed.</p>

			<p><P> December 23, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CHATSWORTH LAWYER FACES MORE CHARGES  </P> <P> A Chatsworth lawyer accused by the State Bar of California of embezzling at  least $125,000 from dozens of clients is facing additional charges of forgery,  grand theft and practicing law while under suspension.  </P> <P> Richard F. Murkey, 43, was arrested Thursday by Los Angeles police officers at  the Van Nuys Superior Court after an appearance on the three counts of grand  theft and two counts of forgery with which he had been charged earlier,  Detective Richard Mulligan said.  </P> <P> Murkey had pleaded not guilty to those charges and was free on $150,000 bail  when arrested.  </P> <P> The district attorney's office plans to charge Murkey with an additional three  counts of practicing law while suspended, four counts of grand theft and one  count of forgery, Deputy Dist. Atty. James A. Baker said Friday.  </P> <P> If convicted, the new charges would add two years to the six years in prison  Murkey already faces, Baker said. He said the additional grand theft charges  arose when victims came forward in response to publicity from Murkey's earlier  arrest, and also from investigations by police and the State Bar of California.  </P> <P> Among the new forgery charges is an allegation that Murkey signed the name of a  client's wife on a $25,000 insurance settlement check last year.  </P> <P> Murkey also is accused of practicing law and negotiating with clients after  August, when the State Bar of California temporarily suspended his license. The  State Bar is seeking to disbar Murkey permanently.  </P> <P> A personal injury lawyer handling mostly automobile accident cases, Murkey  allegedly swindled more than 29 clients and their doctors out of $125,000 in  insurance settlement payments.  </P> <P> Prosecutors allege that Murkey settled cases without approval or knowledge of  his clients, then forged their signatures on checks to get the funds. In one  instance, Murkey allegedly pressed an accident victim to sign a retainer  agreement while the victim lay in a hospital bed with a brain concussion.  </P> <P> Bank records indicate that Murkey, who filed for bankruptcy in September, used  the money for real estate investments, Mulligan said.  </P> <P> He was being held Friday in Van Nuys Jail in lieu of $250,000 bail.  </P> <P> Murkey's attorney, Sherwin C. Edelberg, could not be reached for comment.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 5 (XINHUA) -- Tian Zengpei, Chinese  vice-minister of foreign affairs, summoned U.S. Ambassador  Stapleton Roy here today, and lodged a strong protest with the  United States against its Foreign Relations Authorization Act.    Tian said that on April 28, the United States Congress  passed  the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, fiscal years 1994 and  1995, which was signed by the U.S. President on April 30.    When this bill was being discussed, the Chinese side  expressed serious concern over the anti-China provisions and  made several solemn representations with the U.S. side, Tian  said, adding that "We pointed out to the U.S side that these  provisions, which had severely infringed on China's sovereignty  and constituted a gross interference in China's internal  affairs, would cause serious damage to Sino-U.S. relations."    The U.S. side, however, in disregard of the Chinese side's  strong opposition and representations, went ahead with the  passage and signature of this bill that contains many provisions  detrimental to China's fundamental interests. This can not but  arouse great indignation of the Chinese people, the  vice-minister said.    "I am hereby instructed to lodge a strong protest with the  United States Government on this issue", Tian said.    It is known to all that there is only one China and that  Taiwan is an inalienable part of China, he said, and the  government of the People's Republic of China, as the sole legal  government representing the whole of China, is recognized by the  United Nations and the international community.    With regard to the Taiwan question, Tian said, the U.S.  Government has made unambiguous commitment in the three  Sino-U.S. Joint communiques, and is therefore bound by its  international obligations. But the authorization act states  that "Section 3 of Taiwan Relations Act takes primacy over  statements of government policies, including communiques,  regulations, directives and policies based thereon", thus openly  trampling on the communique of August 17, 1982 between the  Chinese and American Governments and seriously undermining the  basis of Sino-U.S. relations.    The vice-minister said that the act also advocates visits by  American cabinet-level officials to Taiwan and calls on the  American President to take steps to express clearly U.S. support  to Taiwan in bilateral relations and multilateral organizations  of which the United States is a member.    "This is a deliberate attempt to create `two Chinas', `one  China and one Taiwan' in the international arena that completely  contravenes the U.S. Government's commitment to pursue a `one  China' policy," Tian said, and this attempt by the U.S. side to  sabotage China's peaceful reunification and create tension in  the Taiwan Straits will certainly meet with the resolute  position of the Chinese people including our Taiwan compatriots,  and is doomed to failure.    The vice foreign minister also said that Tibet has always  been an inseparable part of China ever since the 13th century,  and no country in the world, including the United States,  recognizes Tibet as an independent country. But the act openly  refers to Tibet as a "country", alleging that Tibet is an  "occupied sovereign country" and "its true representatives are  the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan Government in exile", and even  asks the United States Information Agency to establish an  "office" in Lhasa for the development of educational and  cultural exchanges with the "people of Tibet".    He said that it is indeed shocking to see such a contempt  for  the basic norms governing the international relations, such open  infringement of China's sovereignty and attempt to split China.    The Chinese people waged protracted and arduous struggles to  safeguard their state sovereignty and territorial integrity,  Tian said, and all attempts to split Tibet from the Chinese  territory have ended in total failure with no exception.    "Anyone who still wants to follow this beaten track today  will certainly come to grief", Tian said, and "We appeal to the  U.S. Government to strictly adhere to its openly-stated position  that Tibet is part of China and undertake not to get involved in  any activities aimed at splitting China.    On the "Radio Free Asia", Tian said, China and many other  Asian countries have pointed out clearly on a number of  occasions that the true intention of the United States in  setting up this radio is to use mass media to interfere in the  internal affairs of China and other Asian countries. This act,  however, approves the setting up of such a radio.    Tian said that this action once again shows no regard for  the  universally acknowledged norms governing international relations  and violates the principles enshrined in the three-joint  communiques between China and the United States. It is bound to  meet the resolute opposition from the Chinese people and the  peoples of other Asian countries.    Tian pointed out that Sino-U.S. relations are at a crucial  moment right now, and "We hope that they will move in a positive  direction."    However, he said, it depends on the joint efforts of both  sides to improve and develop the bilateral relations.    The above-mentioned contents of the foreign relations  authorization act seriously undermines the basis of Sino-U.S.  relations, runs counter to the fundamental interests of both  countries and peoples, and are inconsistent with the statement  by the U.S. Government that it wants to develop a positive and  constructive relationship with China.    The vice-minister said that China hereby states in all  seriousness that all the anti-China sections in this act are  absolutely objectionable and unacceptable to the Chinese  Government and people. And "We demand that the U.S. Government  honor its words and adopt effective measures to reverse its  wrong position and erroneous decision so as to strictly adhere  to the principles enshrined in the three joint communiques  between the two countries and the basic norms governing  international relations."    Otherwise, he warned, the U.S. side shall be held  responsible  for all the consequences arising therefrom.</p>

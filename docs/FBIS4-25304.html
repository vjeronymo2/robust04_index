			<p>BFN     [Text] Sydney, June 9 (XINHUA) -- The China trade and  investment forum held in Australia has borne fruitful results  with letters of intent signed on 335 projects, valued at four  billion U.S. dollars.    An official from the Chinese Ministry for Foreign Trade and  Economic Cooperation (MFTEC) described today the forum as  "indicating the broad prospects for developing the  Sino-Australian economic and trade ties."    The forum, ended in Sydney yesterday, was first held in  Melbourne early this month and has altogether attracted 450  people from the Australian business circles.    The forum, the largest ever held in Australia, was also  attended by more than 100 businessmen from China's 20 provinces  and cities, who have brought with them 519 projects, valued at  seven billion U.S. dollars.    Commenting on the results of the forum, the MFTEC official  told Chinese reporters today that the investment in China is on  the upsurge in the Australian business circles.    That's because, he said, "the deepening of reforms in  China's  economic system and its rapid economic growth have created great  opportunities for the Australian businesses."    The Chinese official also said that Australia, which has  shifted its economic and trade focus towards Asia, is in a dire  need of China's largest and most potential market in Asia.    He said that the two countries have seen a steady  development  of bilateral economic and trade ties in the past years thanks  to the mutual complementarity of the two economies and the  importance the Governments of China and Australia have attached  to promoting the bilateral ties.    Official figures indicated that China has approved 1,310  projects involving Australian investment by the end of last year  and China has invested 130 projects in Australia.    The 335 projects singed at the forum mainly focus on  communications, energy, petro-chemical industry, food processing  industry, textile industry, building materials, agriculture and  others.    China and Australia enjoyed a two-way trade of three billion  U.S. dollars last year, representing an increase of 29 percent  over the previous year, according to China's official figures.</p>

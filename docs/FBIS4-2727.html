			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Sun Weiben, secretary of the Heilongjiang </F> Provincial CPC Committee, delivered at the third plenary session  of the provincial discipline inspection commission on 25 March:  "Subject to and Serve the Overall Interests of the Work of the  Entire Party and Carry Out the Anticorruption Struggle  Persistently, Thoroughly, and More Effectively"]    [Text] The Central Discipline Inspection Commission held  its third plenary session to make specific arrangements for this  year's anticorruption struggle in the new situation in which the  entire party and entire country were making efforts to  thoroughly implement the guidelines of the 14th party congress  and the third plenary session of the 14th party Central  Committee, accelerate establishment of the socialist market  economy system, and maintain sustained, rapid, and healthy  economic development. Comrade Jiang Zemin's important speech  given at the session realistically assessed the previous  anticorruption struggle, put forward opinions of the party  Central Committee on the next stage of the anticorruption  struggle, and urged the entire party to make unremitting efforts  to carry on the struggle persistently, thoroughly, and more  effectively. It represented another important policy decision  on comprehensively promoting reform, construction, and  development made by the party Central Committee after taking the  overall situation into consideration, and it is also the  concrete embodiment of the party Central Committee's adherence  to the principle of attending to two tasks simultaneously and  being competent in both in the new situation. We should  thoroughly understand and resolutely implement it.    Since August last year when the party Central Committee and  the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, at its second  plenary session, made important arrangements for the coming  anticorruption struggle, party committees, governments, and  discipline inspection and supervision organs at all levels  across the province have adopted a firm attitude, actively taken  action, and carried out a great amount of painstaking work. The  vast number of cadres and the masses have also shown  wholehearted support and actively participated in the work.  Thanks to the efforts for over half a year, we have achieved  good results in the three tasks of the anticorruption struggle  at varying degrees, some of which are fairly remarkable, and  checked the development and spreading of negative and corrupt  phenomena. This has played a positive role in promoting  Heilongjiang's reform, opening up, and economic construction and  in safeguarding its political stability. Judging from the  situation of the entire province, however, development in the  anticorruption work has been uneven, some results have not been  consolidated, and our work is still falling rather far behind  and cannot satisfy the masses when considering the problems that  actually exist and the expectations of the masses. Thus, the  tasks for the next stage are still very arduous. This third  plenary session of the provincial discipline inspection  commission has made specific arrangements for Heilongjiang's  anticorruption struggle for this year. Party committees,  governments, and discipline inspection and supervision organs  should conscientiously relay the guidelines of this session,  meticulously organize their implementation, and, after  consolidating the achievements already won, carry out this  year's anticorruption struggle persistently, thoroughly, and  more effectively. I will speak on four issues.    1. In-depth development of the anticorruption struggle is an  important prerequisite for deepening reform, promoting  development, and maintaining stability, and it should be  regarded as the major work of the entire party.    This year is a crucial year for accelerating establishment  of  the socialist market economy system and maintaining sustained,  rapid, and healthy economic development. Seizing the  opportunity, deepening reform, opening wider to the outside  world, promoting development, and maintaining stability meet the  overall interests of the work of the entire party and entire  country. Proceeding from the overall interests, the party  Central Committee recently emphasized repeatedly and prominently  that, in view of the current very heavy tasks for reform,  development, and stability, we should continue to take the  anticorruption struggle as the major work of the entire party.  Our party and government leading comrades at all levels must  have a clear and full understanding of this.    First, persistently and profoundly opposing corruption is a  strategic policy decision adopted by the CPC Central Committee  after making a correct appraisal of the work at the preceding  stage. Last year, after experiencing the spreading of corrupt  phenomenon, our party made up its mind to mobilize the whole  party to launch the anticorruption campaign and set a time limit  to resolve the problems strongly complained by the masses.  Through six months' endeavor, it can be said that some results  have been achieved. However, some measures adopted at that  stage were merely aimed at bringing about a temporary solution  to problems. In checking the spreading of the trend of  corruption, some cardinal problems have not yet been solved and  some deep-rooted problems have not yet been touched. Viewed  from the problems already revealed, corrupt phenomenon has now  infiltrated into most spheres of social life. Worse still,  corruption has seriously made inroads on our party and  government organs and on the ranks of cadres. This is a great  shock to us. Therefore, we must foster the idea of fighting a  sustained battle and strive to, in line with the strategic  arrangements of the CPC Central Committee, thoroughly resolve  problems instead of merely bringing about a temporary solution  so that we can deepen the anticorruption campaign step-by-step.    Second, persistently and profoundly opposing corruption is  an  internal demand to deepen reform and accelerate development.  The endeavor in anticorruption and the endeavor in reform,  opening up, and economic development promote and complement each  other. On the one hand, accelerating reform, opening up, and  economic development will create essential material foundation  and condition for checking corruption. On the other hand,  anticorruption constitutes an important guarantee and essential  measure for promoting reform, opening up, and economic  construction. Failing to check corruption will not only  seriously damage the image and authority of the party and the  government and dampen the initiative of the vast numbers of  cadres; but will also make the party's organizations and  discipline listless, hamper the implementation of the party's  principles and policies concerning reform and opening up, as  well as the major policy decision concerning economic  development, and destroy the hard-won achievements in reform and  construction. In particular, under the current situation that  old systems are being replaced by new ones and the legal system  is not perfect enough, some corrupt phenomena will certainly  arise and interfere with and hamper the smooth progress of  reform and construction. If we fail in the economy, we will  come to grief, and if we let corrupt phenomena spread unchecked,  let embezzlement and bribery run wild, and divorce ourselves  from the masses, we will also come to grief. It is absolutely  wrong to set anticorruption against reform, opening up, and  economic development. The practice of anticorruption at the  preceding stage shows that anticorruption work did not affect  reform and opening up but became an important guarantee for  reform, opening up, and economic development. Therefore, the  more we carry out reform and opening up, accelerate the  establishment of the socialist market economic structure, and  develop the economy, the more we should oppose corruption and  strengthen the building of party style and the improvement of  administrative honesty. This is an important experience in  building the socialism with Chinese characteristics.    Third, persistently and profoundly opposing corruption  constitutes an important condition for maintaining political and  social stability. This year, China will set forth more major  reform measures than those in any other year. Along with the  constant deepening of reform and the readjustment of relations  of interests, many new contradictions and problems will emerge.  In particular, some enterprises in the province have suffered  losses for a long time, and considerably more workers and staff  members have been unable to receive their wages on time.  Failing to effectively check and punish corruption will sharpen  contradictions, bring out incidence, and affect unity and  stability. At the same time, we should clearly notice that at  present the hostile forces at home and abroad are still waiting  for opportunities to create confusions and disturbances and are  trying every possible means to "Westernize" and "split" China.  If the party itself is unable to resolve the problems  concerning corruption, it will also provide a handle and a  condition for the hostile forces to launch an attack on us. For  this reason, party and government leading comrades at all levels  must have the sense of worry, always keep sober-minded, launch  the anticorruption campaign in a sustained and profound manner,  provide necessary conditions for maintaining social stability,  and create a fine social and political environment for reform,  opening up, and economic construction.    Fourth, opposing corruption in a deep and sustained manner  is still strongly expected and required of the cadres and the  people inside and outside the party. According to the sample  survey on 5,000 people (households) made by the provincial  discipline inspection commission and the municipal urban survey  team, only 53.3 percent of them were satisfied or comparatively  satisfied with the anticorruption work and 45.4 percent were not  satisfied. Simultaneously, 57.1 percent of the people maintained  that some corrosive phenomena were brought under control through  the previous-stage struggle and that the achievements in  opposing corruption are not consolidated. The broad masses of  the cadres and the people earnestly expect that the struggle  against corruption must be waged neither in the form of  formalism nor in a perfunctory way. They hope to see real  results as soon as possible. We must pay high attention to the  people's opinions and voices. We must firmly foster the mass  viewpoints of Marxism, enhance the sense of responsibility and  the sense of urgency, adopt resolute and forceful measures to  solve the problems that the people have strong complaints, and  also closely rely on the support of the people to wage the  anticorruption struggle in a sustained and profound manner.    2. Ensuring the realization of the current targets is the  major task for opposing corruption. We must exert efforts to  grasp consolidation, deepening, and fruitful achievements.    The practice of the previous anticorruption struggle proved:  To grasp the current-stage targets, we should first start from  bringing about a temporary solution. Through the special  struggle, we should concentratively solve some general problems  of which the people have strong complaints, control the tendency  that corrosive phenomena spread unchecked, and then gradually  eliminate the sources and deep- layered problems that cause  corrosive phenomena. These ideas and methods are accurate and  effective. The general requirements for the 1994 anticorruption  work are to comprehensively fulfill the three tasks as defined  by the central authorities and to make efforts to grasp  consolidation, deepening, and fruitful achievements. Grasping  consolidation means that we should thoroughly grasp the work  that started last year, ensure to see results in the work, and  avoid going back to where we start. Grasping deepening means  that the problems that have been sorted out should resolutely be  corrected and handled, simultaneously we should firmly formulate  and perfect relevant management systems and preventive measures,  and gradually solve the sources and deep- layered problems that  bring about corrosive phenomena. Grasping more fruitful  achievements means that we should sum up and draw on the  experiences gained in the previous stage, improve and intensify  work measures, and make greater achievements. According to the  work ideologies and the unified arrangements of the central  authorities, the party committees and governments at various  levels and the party and government leading comrades should base  themselves on consolidating and developing the work achievements  done in the previous year and comprehensively fulfill the  anticorruption tasks in the previous stage.    First, leading cadres should really be honest and  self-disciplined and see real results in this regard. Leading  cadres' administrative honesty and self-discipline is one of the  three tasks for opposing corruption, as well as a key link to  deepen the anticorruption work. Viewing the situation that the  three tasks were fulfilled this year, we know that some leading  cadres were relatively poor in terms of their administrative  honesty and self-discipline mainly because some leading cadres  were poor in their self-disciplinary awareness and exemplary  functions and kept silent about major charges and admitted minor  ones. Therefore, some deep- layered problems were not exposed  and even some prominent problems were not conscientiously  solved. The masses have many complaints. This year, the central  authorities set forth five new requirements for leading cadres'  administrative honesty and self-discipline and defined to  continuously adopt self-investigation and self-correction  methods. In reality, this is the party's important measure for  cherishing and protecting cadres, as well as an extremely good  opportunity for the broad masses of the cadres to conduct  self-education, self-improvement, and self-extrication. We must  cherish this opportunity, use the regulations on administrative  honesty and self-discipline to restrict and standardize our  activities, and consciously examine and correct existing  problems. Of course, the problems of all the people cannot be  solved through self-investigation and self-correction. We must  strengthen organizational supervision over the people without  awareness and have them be supervised by the masses. The  provincial discipline inspection commission stressed the  necessity to combine leading cadres' self-investigation and  self-correction with the supervision by the masses, the special  clearing-up, and the cadres' administrative honesty. This is  extremely necessary. The provincial party committee has decided  that in the first half of this year the leading bodies should  regard the "new five principles" on administration honesty and  self discipline as an important matter when holding their  democratic life meetings. Prior to democratic life meetings,  they should extensively solicit opinions from the masses. After  the meetings, they should also circulate a notice in a certain  scope to solicit appraisal and supervision. They should  specially clear up the illegally purchased sedans and illegally  occupied houses that have been listed by the central authorities  in the "new five principles" related to administrative honesty  and self discipline. Based on carrying out investigation to know  the real situation and formulating work plans and the provisions  of policies, departments responsible for the work and units  taking the lead in the work should earnestly organize the  enforcement of these principles. Efforts should be made to test  the extent of honesty duty performance enacted by leading bodies  or cadres that have encountered more complaints lodged by the  masses and have not carried out self-improvement. In the course  of testing the extent of honesty duty performance, it is  necessary to integrate discipline inspection with organizational  disposal and to adopt necessary organizational measures to deal  with the problems cropping up by having cadres perform their  official duties honestly and in setting forth employment  orientation. Discipline inspection commissions and  organizational departments at all levels should coordinate with  one another and do a good job in earnestly grasping the work.    Second, we should reinforce the dynamics in handling serious  and appalling cases. Whether we can resolutely and effectively  investigate and handle the large number of serious and appalling  cases, as well as punish the large number of corrupt elements,  represent an important sign to determine whether we can deepen  the struggle against corruption. In line with the arrangements  made by the central authorities we should regard as a focal  point the work of continuously investigating and handling the  cases committed by party and government leading organs, leading  cadres, judicial departments, administration and law-enforcement  departments, economic management departments, and the working  personnel of these departments. We should emphasize  investigating and handling the violation cases committed by  leading cadres, by personnel in charge of enforcing the law and  discipline through practicing favoritism and irregularities and  bending the law by taking bribes, by personnel in charge of  enforcing the law through violating the law, and by legal  persons through violating the law and discipline. Party  committees at all levels should resolutely eliminate the  interference of pleading for mercy and establishing  relationships with personnel and support the organs of  discipline inspection, supervision, and procuratorate to  investigate and handle the large number of serious and appalling  cases. The principal leading personnel of these party  committees should take personal charge of a case if necessary.  All important cases and clues reported by the masses should be  earnestly investigated and handled. Party committees at all  levels may dispatch their reserve cadres to the discipline  inspection commission to help it handle the cases. Only by so  doing can they not only make up the manpower shortage in  handling cases but also train their cadres to upgrade their  party spirit. Governments and financial departments at all  levels should make all-out efforts to ensure the supply of funds  for handling the cases. By no means should we have the handling  of cases be adversely affected by the shortage of manpower and  funds. In investigating and handling serious and appalling  cases, the organs of discipline inspection, supervision, and  public security at all levels should closely coordinate with one  another; supplement one another in strong points; and do a good  job in conducting linking work. In investigating and handling  serious and appalling cases, the party committee may exercise  unified command and concentrate all social forces on waging  total warfare in handling the cases and warfare in handling the  key cases so as to make a breakthrough in this regard as soon as  possible. Meanwhile, the party committee should hold open  trials by selecting a large number of typical cases to frighten  criminal elements and to create a momentum of deeply opposing  corruption.    Third, in correcting the malpractice cropping up among  various industries and trades, we should give the work priority  to the key problems in this regard. The present phenomena of  malpractice and of trading between power and money, particularly  those prevailing among industries and trades, as well as  departments that are holding the power of personnel and  financial affairs and of material supply, are still relatively  serious. The provincial party committee defined last year the  task of carrying out investigation, dissection, clearing-up, and  correction over the key problems cropping up among 10  departments and will firmly grasp the task this year. According  to the unified arrangements made by the central authorities and  the provincial party committee, a good job should be done in  conducting education and rectification in the contingent of  political and legal personnel and in emphatically resolving the  problems of enforcing the law unfairly; bending the law for  private gains; and enforcing the law by violating it. In line  with the reform in the financial systems and the task of  conducting special consolidation over the problems on the  financial front with regard to seeking personal gains by taking  advantage of loans, the administration and law-discipline  enforcement organs on the industrial-commercial front and tax  front should enhance the building of systems for administration  honesty. They should enforce in an overall way the systems of  two openness, one supervision, and of the internal restriction  of power. On the fronts of public health and education, which  are closely related to the masses, we should generally conduct  education on professional ethics and emphatically resolve the  problems related to the ethics and morale of medical circles.  All in all, by proceeding from the reality and according to the  characteristics of various industries and trades as well as of  various departments, we should define the focal points of  consolidation; integrate work style rectification with the  establishment of systems; unite administration honesty with  administration industriousness; and conduct the comprehensive  management of public security through multiple forms and methods  to enable the morale of various industries and trades, as well  as of various departments to achieve an obvious turn for the  better.    3. Deepening reform is the fundamental way to tackle  corruption and the anticorruption work should be carried out in  close coordination with the implementation of major reform  measures.    The current anticorruption struggle is carried out in the  process to accelerate establishment of the socialist market  economy system. We should coordinate our endeavor to oppose  corruption and advocate honesty with implementation of major  reform measures. We should, on the one hand, pay attention to  providing, by opposing corruption, favorable conditions and  guarantees for implementation of various reform measures and, on  the other, start with deepening reform and establishing  necessary systems to fundamentally prevent and check corrupt  phenomena so that we can bring about both a temporary solution  and a permanent cure.    First, we should strictly enforce discipline and carry out  orders and prohibitions to ensure implementation of all reform  measures. Our party's historical experiences proved that party  discipline should be all the more strengthened whenever there is  major social change. This year, the central authorities will  issue a series of major reform measures for establishing the  socialist market economy system. Whether we can ensure the  smooth implementation of government orders is a matter  concerning the success or failure of reform. Therefore, we  should strengthen the restriction of party discipline and ensure  a high degree of political and ideological unity and a high  degree of unity in organization and action of the entire party.  Party organizations at all levels and cadres with party  membership should strictly abide by the party's political and  organizational discipline; resolutely implement the policies and  measures of the party Central Committee and the State Council  for reform, development, and political stability; carry out all  orders and prohibitions; and act in unison. It is not permitted  to comply in public but oppose in private, act one's own way,  and obstruct and interfere with the progress of reform; it is  not permitted to take advantage of reform to line one's pockets  and seek illicit interests; and it is not permitted to take  advantage of one's authority to create difficulties to or extort  money from enterprises and grass-roots levels. Discipline  inspection and supervision organs at all levels should  strengthen supervision and inspection in a planned manner  according to established priorities, with the focus on  implementation of the "decision" of the third plenary session of  the 14th party Central Committee and implementation of the  series of major policies and measures of the party Central  Committee and the State Council for deepening reform, developing  the economy, and safeguarding political stability.    Second, when major reform measures are issued, we should  adopt preventive measures from the angle of improving party  style and administrative honesty and formulate corresponding  regulations and measures to make sure that good results are  achieved both in deepening reform and in opposing corruption and  advocating honesty. In implementing major reform measures and  economic policies, it is impossible to be perfect at the very  beginning, and it is unavoidable that some people will take  advantage of the loopholes created by the temporary imperfect  supervision, management, laws, and regulations to indulge  themselves in some new corrupt and unhealthy trends. At a  discussion and study session for provincial-level cadres held in  November last year, Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out: "Is not it  time to make it a regulation for party committees and  governments at all levels, while implementing the major policies  and measures of the central authorities for economic  development, reform, and opening up, to list improvement of  party style and administrative honesty high on their agenda, put  forward realistic and feasible support measures, and  conscientiously implement them together." In compliance with  this requirement, party committees, governments, and pertinent  departments, when issuing major reform measures, should conduct  study early and work out measures to address the problems that  may arise in party style and administrative honesty. Discipline  inspection and supervision organs, in particular, should  actively participate in this work and take the initiative in  intensifying investigation and study on the forefront of reform,  opening up, and economic construction to learn about and analyze  the new conditions and new problems, to help party committees,  governments, and pertinent departments study and formulate  measures for preventing and checking unhealthy trends, and to  use these measures to standardize the behaviors of party and  government leading cadres and ensure the healthy development of  economic construction, reform, and opening up.    Third, we should strive to study and explore a new way for  preventing corruption by relying on reform and building systems.  One of the important reasons for the reappearance of passive  corrupt phenomena is that we have failed to improve the  situation by checking the sources of corruption and eliminating  the soil and conditions that give rise to corruption. To solve  the problem on corruption, we must keep an eye on the overall  situation, grasp the sources of corruption, resolve problems in  terms of systems and the legal system, and take both radical and  stopgap measures. Through deepening reform of the financial,  taxation, banking, and investment systems, we should resolve the  problems on arbitrarily pooling funds, donations, and fees from  enterprises, extorting money or articles from enterprises, and  taking advantage of lending loans, collecting taxes, and  approving projects to seek personal gain; through promoting  reform of the cadre personnel system, we should give public  examinations, recruit people by invitation, and introduce the  competitive and incentive mechanisms, adopt the method of  clearing the channels for exchanging cadres and ensuring that  those who assume leadership posts can work at higher or lower  levels as required, and solve the unhealthy trends in the course  of carrying out cadre personnel work; through public bidding, we  should check the unhealthy trends in real estate development and  contract of projects; and through deepening reform of the  housing system, we should solve the unhealthy trends in housing  distribution and using public funds to furnish houses above the  set standards or reselling public houses at a profit. We should  formulate a method and a system of supervising and controlling  power performance, such as making the work procedures public,  analyzing and restricting the internal powers, assuming  important posts on rotation, and jointly managing official work,  and gradually institutionalize and legalize the anticorruption  struggle.    4. Since upholding the principle of taking a two-handed  approach is our party's strategic principle and an art of  leadership, we must strengthen leadership over anticorruption  struggle in the course of carrying out all fields of work.    Persisting in taking a two-handed approach and be tough with  both is an important component of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory  on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the  strategic principle which our party should uphold for a long  time, and the Marxist art of leadership. According to the  previous experience and lessons, the trend of being soft with  one hand and hard with the other hand will easily appear when  the reform and economic work tasks are very heavy. This year  more reform measures will be issued, the strength in this aspect  will be great, and risks will appear. Under such circumstances,  we should all the more uphold the principle of taking a  two-handed approach and be tough with both, and should all the  more strengthen leadership over anticorruption. In this  connection, we should continue to stress the following few  points:    First, we should continue to implement the system of  assuming  responsibility over anticorruption work and form a trend of  making both party and government organs jointly grasp and manage  this work. Fighting corruption is a common task of the whole  party. People who are in charge of the work of the party  committee or the government must attend to and grasp the  anticorruption work well. Grasping two tasks does not mean that  one task should be grasped by the party committee and the other  task should be grasped by the government. Instead, they should  closely combine two tasks, grasp them well, and seek  achievements. Party committees and governments at all levels  should properly handle the relations of reform, development,  stability, and anticorruption, firmly attend to the central task  of economic construction, persist in taking a two-handed  approach, give consideration to the overall situation, combine  the work of fighting corruption with deepening reform, promoting  development, and safeguarding stability, continue to introduce  anticorruption to all fields of work, and establish a strict  responsibility system. The party and government top leaders  should assume full responsibility, and personally resolve major  problems. Party and government leading bodies should share the  work, really assume responsibility over the anticorruption  struggle work on all fronts, and realistically form a situation  in which the party and government jointly manage this work.  Governments at all levels, operational departments, and  pertinent departments in all trades should grasp not only the  economic efficiency and targets in the course of grasping  economic work, but also the work style and common practices of  organs and various trades; in addition to grasping the economic  factors that affect economic work, they should also pay  attention to solving noneconomic factors that affect economic  development. We should persist in simultaneously planning,  inspecting, and summing up the economic work and anticorruption  struggle, combine the two, and make them promote each other.    Second, we should strengthen supervision, inspection,  examination, and guidance. This year, the provincial party  committee will continue to send inspection groups, examination  groups, and investigation groups to grass-roots areas to  supervise, examine, and guide the work of various localities and  departments in opposing corruption and advocating administrative  honesty. Leading cadres at all levels should try their best to  go deep into some key departments, grass-roots units, and the  places that are weak in anticorruption work to find out problems  in a timely manner and give specific guidance to them. Those  who only talk but not practice and those who are poor in  conducting the anticorruption work should be criticized or  warned and should be given resolute organizational measures if  necessary. We should strengthen investigation and study, pay  attention to new circumstances and new problems in a timely  manner, and mete out countermeasures to ensure the sound and  orderly development of an anticorruption campaign.    Third, we should genuinely and sincerely support discipline  inspection and supervisory organs to perform duties. Discipline  inspection and supervisory organs shoulder arduous and heavy  tasks in the first line of anticorruption work. Leading  comrades of party committees and governments at all levels  should pay high attention to and wholeheartedly support the work  of these organs. First, efforts should be made to give full  play to the role of discipline inspection and supervisory organs  as the advisers and assistants to the party and the government.  Party committees and governments at all levels, principal  responsible comrades in particular, should frequently listen to  the work reports of discipline inspection and supervisory  organs, help these organs resolve all sorts of problems in a  timely manner, and support them to conscientiously perform their  functions of supervising, inspecting, coordinating, and  comprehensive guiding anticorruption work. Second, discipline  inspection and supervisory organs should be supported to enforce  discipline and handle cases. When investigating and handling  major discipline violation cases in particular, party committees  and governments should serve as a powerful backing for  discipline inspection and supervisory organs. Leading comrades  at all levels should not only personally take a hand in handling  cases but also support discipline inspection and supervisory  organs to handle cases impartially and help these organs break  with favoritism through connections and resist the practice of  pleading for mercy. The discipline violation cases committed by  members of discipline inspection and supervisory organs should  also be dealt with without shielding and leniency. Third,  discipline inspection and supervisory organs should be supported  to resolve practical problems. Discipline inspection and  supervisory organs shoulder heavy tasks and face relatively more  problems. Some problems they face cannot be resolved by  themselves. Party committees and governments at all levels  should show concern for the work and life of the ranks of  discipline inspection and supervisory cadres and should do  several tangible things for these organs every year, such as,  providing sufficient and competent members for their leading  bodies, facilitating the exchanges of discipline inspection and  supervisory cadres, improving the conditions for handling  affairs and cases, and allocating sufficient funds for these  organs. In the forthcoming organizational reform, party  committees and governments should give full consideration to the  anticorruption work and to the practical demand of discipline  inspection and supervisory work so that the strength of  discipline inspection and supervisory organs will not be  weakened. Comrades of discipline inspection and supervisory  organs should also continuously carry forward the spirit of  selfless dedication, being devoted to one's duty, being  law-abiding, and making innovations, and should do outstanding  and fruitful work to make new contributions to launching the  anticorruption campaign in a sustained and profound manner, to  ensure reform, opening up, and economic development, and to  safeguard political stability.</p>

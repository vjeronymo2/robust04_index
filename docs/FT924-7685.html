			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Finance and the Family: Going for growth THOSE WHO have faith that UK chancellor Norman Lamont will succeed in 'going for growth' might be interested in a new UK growth unit trust launched this week by Newton. The trust is aimed to complement the company's existing income fund and will have the same managers. It will invest primarily in low-yielding companies where there is a chance of significant growth. Up to 20 per cent of the fund can be invested outside the UK in international equity and bond funds. Newton does not plan to use this facility much and will not invest in speculative stocks, but could use it for currency hedging. The initial charge is high at 6 per cent (although there will be a discount to 4 per cent during the offer period, which lasts until November 30), with an annual management charge of 1.25 per cent. The fund can be used for a Pep. Minimum investment is Pounds 1,000. Investors must decide whether the UK economy is going to start showing decisive growth. But Newton's record on its other UK funds withstands scrutiny - according to Micropal, in the five years to this month, Newton Income stands second out of 95 in its sector, with growth of 73.89 per cent. The sector itself could do with a recovery. Even after the Black Monday crash of October 1987 fell out of the five-year figures, the average UK Growth trust has grown only 23.24 per cent.</p>

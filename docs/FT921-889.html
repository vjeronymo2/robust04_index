			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: GE cuts investment in Hungary operation GENERAL Electric of the US is retrenching at its Tungsram light bulb operation in Hungary, one of the earliest and largest joint ventures by a western company in eastern Europe. GE announced cuts in investment, employment and production at Tungsram after preliminary results showed the subsidiary had lost Ft1.1bn (Dollars 13.6m) last year. Up to half of the planned investment of Dollars 40m for 1992 is to be held back. Staffing levels are to be reduced 25 per cent, with administrators most sharply hit. Production facilities will be idled for an average of two weeks to allow a reduction of stocks. Only last June,GE increased its stake in Tungsram to more than 75 per cent and took total investment to more than Dollars 200m, declaring confidence in the subsidiary's prospects. GE-Tungsram blamed rising local costs for the reversal and called for devaluation of the forint, the Hungarian currency, to keep pace with inflation. The company said that a 40 per cent gap between inflation and currency depreciation had put the survival of Hungarian exporters into question. At the same time, prices for lighting products in Tungsram's main west European markets are falling. Mr Gyorgy Varga, chief executive of GE-Tungsram, said that Suzuki, Ford and General Motors, which are all embarking on large investments in Hungary, would face similar problems. GE has been frustrated in repeated efforts to force a change in exchange-rate policy. The Hungarian government, bound by its agreement with the International Monetary Fund, remains commited to a policy of firm monetary policy and high exchange rates to maintain downward pressure on inflation, even if that is painful for exporters. Nevertheless, GE maintained that Tungsram's long-term promise remained bright.</p>

			<p><P> January 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GREAT GOWN DUST-UP;  </P> <P> A TANGLED TALE OF DESIGNS FOR THE INAUGURAL DRESSES FINDS THREE HAPPY STUDENTS  AND AN OCEAN OF SILENCE  </P> <P> The first fashion flap of the new Administration erupted this week, even before  the inaugural oaths were read.  </P> <P> The convoluted question of what Marilyn Quayle, wife of the incoming vice  president, will or will not wear will be answered today when she appears for  the day's events, from swearing-in through inaugural balls, in the  just-announced hand-made original designs of three Los Angeles fashion  students.  </P> <P> Trendy designer Victor Costa, whose dresses she was first reported to have  chosen, could not be reached for comment. He was in Washington to attend the  full schedule of festivities.  </P> <P> Heroes of this week's fashion drama are the three students at Los Angeles'  Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising, who were selected last November  by Mrs. Quayle to design her inaugural clothes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Labors in Secret  </P> <P> Denise Ervin, Dan Caudill and Allison Miller have toiled on their historic  sewing project ever since, without leaking a word to the press. Once the word  got out Wednesday, the three said: "We were shocked. We're still shocked. We're  very excited. We're thrilled." They were talking from Washington, where they've  been holed up at a hotel for a week, putting finishing touches -- and  re-touches -- on their designs.  </P> <P> Not so heroic, according to the vice-presidential press office, were designer  Costa and some fashion press, who not only released incorrect news about  Quayle's choice, but compounded the error by mentioning anything at all about  Marilyn Quayle's inaugural clothes.  </P> <P> "We wanted no mention of Mrs. Quayle's choices until after the  President-elect's wife announced hers," press aide Barbara Balzano said. "We  did not want to look as if we're upstaging Barbara Bush, which is something of  which we've already been accused."  </P> <P> Mrs. Bush didn't make it any easier. Apparently in a whimsical mood, she told  Women's Wear Daily on Monday, "I'm not telling. I don't know why, but I'm not.  It's just fun not to." (The fashion trade paper nonetheless revealed in that  same article, that New York designer Arnold Scaasi had designed the gown Mrs.  Bush would wear to the ball.)  </P> <P> The students got their job because Mrs. Quayle wanted to advance the cause of  America's student designers, Balzano said. Quayle first contacted the school's  Washington branch, which doesn't have an advanced program and so forwarded her  request to the main L.A. campus, where officials selected the three students  most likely capable of doing the needed work.  </P> <P> "Sometimes I think our parents are more excited than we are. My mom cries every  time I talk to her," said Allison Miller, 24, of Long Beach, who designed  10-year-old Second Daughter Corinne Quayle's inaugural outfit: a robin's egg  blue wool dress and cream-color wool coat and beret.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Caudill Swearing-In Suit Designer  </P> <P> Daniel Caudill, 22, who lives with his parents in Orange County, designed Mrs.  Quayle's swearing-in suit. It's of royal blue wool with dropped shoulders,  intricate seaming, has a matching coat and modified bowler hat. Caudill says  his school is considering this "a homework project, but it's harder than any  homework we've ever had." Without their instructor, Hubert Latimer, Caudill  said, "we might never have gotten through." Latimer is in Washington with the  three.  </P> <P> Denise Ervin, 32, who designed the inaugural ballgown (but will not describe it  "because we're waiting for Mrs. Bush to describe hers first") is from Omaha,  Neb., where she was a costume designer at Omaha Community Playhouse for 11  years.  </P> <P> The three students are in the institute's Advanced Study Program, which has  eleven students this semester and which they describe as being "like a fashion  graduate school."  </P> <P> The students say that after being selected, they did preliminary sketches and  assembled fabric swatches while in Los Angeles. Then they flew to Washington on  about Dec. 7, where they showed their ideas to Mrs. Quayle in her office  opposite the White House. They saw her again on Dec. 8, when she selected the  styles and colors she preferred. They then went home to sew, and returned a  week ago for fittings and alterations. Their final fittings were Monday.  </P> <P> During all this time, Victor Costa was apparently under the mistaken assumption  that his jade green silk dress with portrait neckline would be worn by Quayle  to the inaugural ball.  </P> <P> "Mrs. Quayle did come here and make selections," Bob Miller, managing director  of the Costa firm, said Wednesday. "She selected a color and style of gown in a  tea length. Then we got a call that that she wanted it full length. Her office  told us it was needed by a very definite date. It became a much more important  dress.  </P> <P> "We even went out and bought the beautiful silk satin at retail (prices)  because we didn't want to order it (wholesale) and take a chance of being  late."  </P> <P> The dress arrived at Mrs. Quayles's on time; she has paid for it and now owns  it. Whether it will come out of the closet for any event this weekend, no one  really knows for sure.  </P></p>

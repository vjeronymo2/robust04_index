			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  fileworthy reports on economic developments in Cuba carried on  Havana radio and television in Spanish between 24 December and 4  January.    Radio Reloj at 2045 GMT on 24 December reports that Granma  Province met its coffee production goal for the present  campaign, representing a 15-percent increase over the same  period, 1992.    Radio Reloj at 2050 GMT on 24 December reports that the  Austrian "Sun Over Cuba" solidarity group sent a donation  consisting of a computer, school materials, and medicine. The  donations will be distributed to the Camilo Cienfuegos School  and the Rafael Freire Hospital in Holguin. The computer will be  sent to the Institute of Solar Energy.    Radio Rebelde at 1255 GMT on 27 December reports that Royal,  a Canadian company, has joined the airlines that bring tourists  from Toronto, Canada, to Ciego de Avila, Royal is scheduled to  fly to Ciego de Avila and Camaguey on a weekly basis.    Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 3 January reports that Villa  Clara Province has attained an infant morality rate for 1993 of  6.6 per 1,000 live births.    Radio Reloj at 2043 GMT on 3 January reports that Maria  Lucia  Ruiz, Havana tour manager in Colombia, last night greeted the  first charter flight of Colombian tourists to Varadero. On 9  January, a charter flight from Colombia is to arrive in Cuba.    Radio Rebelde at 1000 GMT on 4 January reports that railway  service between Guantanamo Province and the rest of the nation  has been restored. Eighty percent of the merchandise going to  Guantanamo Province is moved by rail.    The same newscast reports that the Caribe Navigation  Enterprise on the Isle of Youth has announced that the number of  passenger trips by motorboat between Nueva Gerona and Batabano  will be reduced this month because of a lack of spare parts: As  of 10 January, there will be two rather than three departures.  In order to make up for this reduction in the current  transportation program, ships will also depart on Mondays,  Wednesdays, and Fridays and return on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and  Sundays. "In order to achieve this increase, the ferry Isla de  la Juventude, which can carry more than 500 passengers, will be  rendered operative."    Radio Rebelde further announces that Matanzas oil workers  extracted 814,000 tons of oil in 1993, "which was 81 percent of  the program for the period, at the same time setting a national  record for crude oil production." Officials of the oil  extraction enterprise of Central Cuba said that of a potential  21 million cubic meters of natural gas, just over 15.5 million  cubic meters were used, "which shows that the demand for this  fuel is still low. Despite failure to fulfill the investment  programs, difficulties with the system for moving crude oil  along the coast by ship, and scarce resources, this enterprise  -- which produced the greatest amount of oil in Cuba -- showed  an increase in drilling last year, with 15,500 meters. There are  currently 180 wells in the largest oil deposit yet discovered in  Cuba. Exploration continues in that zone with a view to  increasing its potential and extracting higher- quality oil.    Radio Progreso at 1200 GMT on 4 January reports that Cuban  oil workers hope to extract 1.2 million tons of crude in 1994.  There are also plans to increase seismic research in 1994 with a  view to improving exploration; Cuba hopes to have a much  stronger investments program and to begin drilling all over the  country. "Four new sites, located in the traditional petroleum  areas, also will be opened."    In the same newscast, Progreso's Sanciti Spiritus  correspondent reports that the industrial gases factory in  Sancti Spiritus has begun making chalk for use in Cuba's  schools. The plant engineer notes that most of the chalk in Cuba  used to be imported from China and that the chalk being produced  in Cuba now is "almost of better quality than the Chinese chalk."    Radio Rebelde Network at 1255 GMT on 4 January reports that  Granma Province sugar sector workers have fulfilled the  cold-season cane planting plan. They planted almost 437  caballerias; and 10 of the 11 sugar industry complexes met their  commitments. Also, "Havana farmers made a big effort in December  to catch up as regards the cold-season planting, and they began  1994 with close to 1,500 caballerias planted in tubers and  vegetables, which will guarantee the program for February."    Radio Rebelde Network at 1800 GMT on 4 January reports that  the "La Victoria de Giron" citrus-producing complex, the largest  in the nation, managed to stop the decline in its plantations by  the end of 1993 by establishing cooperation in production that  facilitated credits for buying fuel and agricultural inputs.  This allowed the recovery of approximately 20,000 hectares,  which constitute over 50 percent of the complex's lands. In 1993  the complex produced over 7 million quintals of citrus fruits.    In the same newscast, Rebelde reports that 359 high-voltage  transformers were recovered in Ciego de Avila Province in 1993.  "The work team that specializes in the recovery of that kind of  equipment is currently working on rewinding and adapting a group  of 160-kilovolt Italian transformers that will be set up at  sugar-production complexes in Ciego de Avila and Sancti Spiritus  for the current harvest."    In the same cast, Rebelde also reports that a new type of  materials-efficient floor tile, sometimes called "the  streamlined tile", has been developed by the Construction  Materials Enterprise of Sancti Spiritus. Production of this tile  allows for practically doubling the amount of surface that can  be tiled using the same amount of raw materials. The tile is  made with scrap residue from the sugar mills in place of silica  and powdered stone. Because of its light weight, this tile also  is easier to transport and to lay.</p>

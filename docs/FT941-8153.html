			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Rover and Honda - Going Their Own Ways: Government comes under pressure to intervene The government was yesterday under pressure from some of its own backbenchers to encourage Honda to continue its collaboration with Rover. Angry calls for intervention from Tory MPs are likely to dismay ministers, who only a few weeks ago were privately expressing relief that Rover's sale to BMW had not caused a political row. Sir Teddy Taylor, (Southend East), said: 'Honda has been treated shamefully. A minister should now make a public statement saying the government regrets the way the sale of Rover to BMW has been handled to alleviate the problem.' Another senior backbencher said the Department of Trade and Industry 'should start batting for Britain' by encouraging the Japanese to guarantee a long-term working relationship with Rover. However, Downing Street dismissed calls for intervention arguing that it was not a matter for the prime minister. It was made clear that Mr John Major hopes that co-operation will continue between Honda and Rover, but does not share the 'apocalyptic vision' of those who fear a speedy end to the relationship. However, Mr Simon Coombs, (Swindon) warned that a decision by Honda to sever all its links with Rover could prove very damaging. Although Honda stressed that the 2,000 jobs at its plant in Swindon would not be affected by its decision to sell its 20 per cent Rover stake, Mr Coombs said an end to joint contracts would affect many of his constituents reliant on Honda. He has already asked Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister, to find out why there was no British company interested in buying the country's last car volume manufacturer. There is deep unease among backbenchers that Honda's decision to sell its stake in Rover could herald the end of the relationship between the two companies. There is also concern that it could harm Britain's chances of continuing to receive the biggest share of Japanese inward investment in Europe. The UK accounts for 40 per cent of all Japanese European investment, according to government figures. 'We now know that Honda are deeply distressed' said Sir Teddy. 'If its not to have an affect on Japanese inward investment, the government must make a statement'. Mr Robin Cook, Labour's shadow trade and industry spokesman, called on ministers to live up to their promise that Rover and its workforce would not suffer from the BMW takeover. 'The danger for Rover is that customers will lose confidence and the workforce will lose morale if the uncertainty is not ended swiftly,' he said.</p>

			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / International Company News: Westpac branch may be saved WESTPAC Banking Corporation, Australia's biggest bank, appears set to reverse a decision to close its Seoul branch after reaching agreement with unions in South Korea to end a seven-month strike. The agreement is expected to be signed today. Mr Choi Dong Soo, chief manager of the Westpac branch in Seoul, is to recommend to Westpac's board that it change its decision to close the branch. A manager at the bank said that approval to stay open would be 'a formality'. The central issue in the dispute - the powers of the union in a personnel committee which would participate in hiring and disciplinary decisions - appears to have been resolved in favour of management. Under the agreement, the chief manager of the bank will be chairman of the personnel committee and cast the deciding vote in cases of deadlock on the eight-member body. Earlier the union had rejected granting management the deciding vote. 'We think this is a big concession,' said an official at the bank, but added: 'We were not prepared to give up control on this fundamental issue of management rights.' A manager at a European bank in Seoul welcomed the decision. He said it demonstrated that unreasonable wage and managerial demands by unions were not sustainable and would influence unions at other foreign banks in Seoul. The strike was marred by allegations of violence by both sides. Striking workers also blasted music through loudspeakers placed outside the bank in an attempt to disrupt business.</p>

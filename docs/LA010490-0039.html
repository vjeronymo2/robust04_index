			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: GROUP DOESN'T WELCOME HIM  </P> <P> DEAR DR. BROTHERS: I was sexually molested by my stepfather for three years  starting when I was 9 years old. I blocked this all out of my memory until  recently, when a shocking incident I won't describe made me recall it.  Recently, I've joined a support group -- women who have experienced the same  trauma as I. My husband, whom I love dearly, would like to accompany me to  these meetings and I don't know how to explain that he isn't wanted. It's not  that we're hostile, but it would be wrong. -- K.E.  </P> <P> DEAR K.E.: As I'm sure you know, there are lasting effects of incest and those  who survive and are able to live relatively normal lives, as you have, will  always carry with them a certain distrust and a sense of extreme cautiousness  about those of the opposite sex. It would be insensitive to the women in your  support group for you to bring your husband. Even though you love and trust  him, obviously they don't.  </P> <P> It takes a long time for most incest victims to be able to discuss what  happened to them and they certainly wouldn't be able to share their tragic past  with strangers. Most women who have been sexually abused feel more comfortable  with their own sex. Incidentally, this is also true of men who have been  sexually abused in childhood.  </P> <P> I'm sure if you explain this to your husband he'll understand. Let him know how  much you need this support group and how valuable it is to you and all the  women who participate.  </P> <P> DEAR DR. BROTHERS: A new kid in our neighborhood found some pornographic  magazines in his father's room and, unfortunately, showed them to my  15-year-old son. I'd certainly have preferred that he not be exposed to this  kind of trash, but now, as his mother, I don't know how to erase the memories  he must be carrying around in his mind. What he saw was not just "girlie stuff"  but hard-core sadistic pornography. What can I do? -- W.P.  </P> <P> DEAR W.P.: Youngsters are much more influenced by what they see in their homes  day after day than they are by any single exposure to pornography. If they've  been raised in a climate where men and women treat each other kindly and  respectfully, the sadistic behavior typified in the photos may shock them, but  they won't be tempted to imitate it. They'll be much more likely to be offended  than to be titillated.  </P> <P> Ideally, this would be a time when your son's father would have a talk with  him. However, if his father isn't around, and there's no surrogate father you  trust, then it might be wise for you to point out that physical power and  violence are not an appropriate part of sexuality. Any sexual act that demeans  or humiliates one of the sexual partners is wrong and is actually destructive  to everyone.  </P> <P> You might also pick up the phone and have a talk with this boy's parents to let  them know that you don't want your son to be exposed to this garbage.  </P></p>

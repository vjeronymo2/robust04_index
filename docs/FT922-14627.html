			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Survey of Latin American Finance and Investment (13): Interest in swaps flags / Debt Conversions THE push to convert sovereign debt into equity capital for local businesses, once seen as one of the answers to the Latin American debt crisis, has flagged of late. Early attempts - such as Chile's move to convert some Dollars 10bn of sovereign debt converted either into equity or other forms of debt - have not been repeated. The main reason: the inflationary impact of such programmes, which has acted as a disincentive across the region (though the fact that the discount on Chilean debt has fallen to only around 10 per cent of face value has also removed much of the attraction in its case). Retiring debt at its face value forces governments to print money. The antidote - issuing government debt to soak up the extra cash in the system - can drive up local interest rates, and has come to be seen as counter-productive. As a result, debt-for-equity swaps are now seriously under consideration only in relation to privatisation issues. Such schemes do not involve any additional cash, and so have no inflationary repercussions. In principle, the use of debt/equity swaps for privatisations has now been embraced by Brazil, Argentina and Peru. Of these, only Argentina has pushed ahead with the idea with vigour. Peru has hinted that debt conversion will be possible in the planned privatisation of around 25 local companies, though this remains a promise rather than a reality. The country's foreign debt has not been snapped up in anticipation, says Mr Ric Haller, head of LDC debt trading at Morgan Grenfell in London. 'Peruvian debt is a speculative buy,' he says. Brazil, on the other hand, has removed much of the attraction of converting foreign debt into equity. Foreign debt faces a compulsory 25 per cent discount - that is, it is bought back at 75 per cent of face value, rather than the full amount. That has discouraged the use of such debt in privatisations so far. Efforts have been made in some quarters to have the discount restriction relaxed. The National Development Bank, which is responsible for the privatisation process in Brazil, has lobbied to have the rule changed, arguing that this would attract more investors to privatisations and maximise proceeds from sales. That appeal was rejected last month, and observers do not expect a change of heart in the foreseeable future. One concession was made, though: half of Brazil's so-called 'PFA' debt, issued at the time of the 1988 parallel financing agreement, is now available for use in debt/equity conversions, making some Dollars 1.6bn available for this purpose, says Mr Igor Cornelson, director of Standard Chartered Merchant Bank in San Paolo. Domestic debt, which is accepted without a discount, has therefore become the main vehicle for debt/equity swaps. There are attractions to Brazil in maintaining this position: local debt generally carries a higher interest rate and matures earlier than foreign debt, says Mr Cornelson. Local debt is equally available to foreign companies with operations in the country - though as yet, there are few signs of foreigners taking an interest in such swaps. Almost all the Dollars 1.7bn raised through privatisations in Brazil last year consisted of local debt: 0.3 per cent was accounted for by foreign debt, thanks to the fixed 25 per cent discount. That leaves Argentina as the most active exponent of the debt/equity swap in Latin America. Through a number of privatisations in the past 18 months, significant amounts of foreign debt have been converted. Most notable have been the privatisations of Aeorlineas Argentinas, control of which passed to Iberia, the Spanish national carrier; and ENTel, the telephone company, 60 per cent of which was sold to two groups led by Citibank and J P Morgan. Questions have been raised about whether it is desirable for the control of important Argentine assets to pass into the hands of European state-owned enterprises or international banks - particularly if the sales are at a discount. But as a means of retiring debt, the privatisation process looks set to continue.</p>

			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Arts: The Beaux' Stratagem - Theatre Dartford, early Saturday evening. Windswept wastes, closed shopping malls, streets lifeless but for the odd burger or pizza joint; and the market-vendors playfully hurling left-over fruit as they dismantle their stalls (your critic sustained a glancing blow to the right ear from an orange). All sign-posts point to the Orchard Theatre - or away from it; only yards from the building one theatre sign directs you in the opposite direction. This text-book illustration of wanton urban misplanning is the launch pad for English Touring Theatre's production of Farquhar's second best-known comedy. The Beaux Stratagem is no Recruiting Officer: slackly plotted, incompletely characterised, unbalanced between talk and action. Stephen Unwin's production has yet to fill out the comedy, though the central paradox emerges clearly. Already Restoration heartlessness is a thing of the past (dating from 1707, it was the tubercular playwright's last work). The two fortune-hunters may recall or anticipate the era when everything had its price, when humans were merchandise and private happiness and social expediency ran on separate and not always parallel rails; but already the soft heart of the middle-class domestic comedy of Goldsmith and Sheridan is anticipated. 'So much pleasure for so much money]' muse the young bloods in search of financial prey. But the play ends with confessions, honest avowals of love and - the heart of the paradox - an argument for divorce; a forward-looking version of the traditional happy ending if there ever was one. Jackie Brooks' design is backed by a landscape from the canvases of Richard Wilson or possibly those assertive 18th-century portraits where the landowner is dwarfed by his lovingly depicted property. Corin Buckeridge's music alternates jingling mock-Baroque with springy, folksy rhythms. The acting is straightforward, in the case of Louis Hilyer's Archer admirably so. As Mrs Sullen trapped in an impossible marriage, Deborah Findley also acknowledges the irony, with a vengeance. She plays from the arms, like Maggie Smith, stretched out as if gingerly balancing on an invisible tightrope. By the second half, this feeling for high style has degenerated into a charmless flirting with the audience. The supporting roles are flat and, in the case of Doreen Andrew's mob-capped Lady Bountiful, needlessly self-effacing, though Faith Flint's naturalistic Dorinda makes a positive mark. The comedy needs far more pointing. That may occur in the tour to Taunton, Buxton, Harlow, Watford, Oxford, Blackpool and Richmond, not to mention a break in Istanbul and Ankara. Beware of flying aubergines.</p>

			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Observer: World Bank watch The hunt for Larry Summers' replacement as the World Bank's economic guru seems to be taking an inordinately long time. Since there are not many Brits in top positions at the bank, and the job will probably go to a non-American, how about Richard Layard, 59, professor of economics at the London School of Economics? He's best remembered in Whitehall for pointing out flaws in the Thatcher government's presentation of unemployment figures. But as an adviser to the Yeltsin government he has first hand experience of the problems of former communist economies - a central part of the bank's portfolio in the 1990s. As founder of the Centre for Economic Performance he has the necessary administrative skills, and his expertise in micro-issues, such as the economics of human resource development, is now seen as key to effective third world development. If he is too old, or regarded as lacking the intellectual gravitas, then there are plenty of other candidates in Britain and elsewhere. It is right that Lewis Preston, the World Bank president and former J P Morgan banker, wants somebody with whom he feels personally comfortable. But with pressing challenges in the former Soviet Union and elsewhere, he shouldn't dilly-dally much longer. Even economists need leaders.</p>

			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / After The VAT Vote: Tories seethe over breaking of ranks Government business managers have been left shaken and angry over the way most of the Conservative rebels suspended from the parliamentary party last week helped defeat the government in Tuesday night's vote on value added tax on domestic fuel. Eight of the nine who had the whip withdrawn in the wake of last week's confidence vote on Europe, either abstained or voted against the government in its eight-vote defeat on VAT. The decision by so many of them to line up against the government again so soon after their last act of defiance is raising the question at Westminster of whether a party within a party is forming. If it is - and if the rebels feel justified in thumbing their noses at the government at will - then Mr John Major, the prime minister, really will find himself at the head of a minority administration. Certainly, there appeared to be a degree of co-ordination in how the rebels chose to vote on Tuesday, since eight of them held a secret meeting to discuss the position within hours of the frantic denouement in a packed Commons chamber. But the fact that not all voted the same way, with three voting against the government, one with and five abstaining, suggests that the rebels are too independent-minded to want to set up their own informal whipping operation. At the very least, the VAT on domestic fuel episode indicates that most of the rebels feel losing the whip has left them free to judge issues on their merits rather than voting consistently with the government in a bid to have the whip restored. As Mr Tony Marlow, the rebel MP for Northampton North, said: 'Supposing the Conservative party as a whole had not been subject to the whip, they may have come to the same conclusion as I did.' But Mr Marlow, in common with other rebels, denies emphatically that a party within a party is being formed. 'We are a group of people who share an objective with regard to Europe,' he said. 'We believe the party cannot be re-elected unless and until we have a policy on Europe with which people can feel at ease.' Whatever the true position, it seems the government will have to soldier on with a technical minority for some time to come, in spite of strong calls for reconciliation from the right of the party. The decision to remove the whip from the rebels was enough - in technical terms - to wipe out the government's paper majority of 14. The Tory whips accuse the rebels of vindictiveness, claiming that some sent out 'very clear signals' that they would support the government, then changed their minds. According to one business manager, one of the MPs who rebelled wrote a letter to Mr Richard Ryder, the chief whip, within the past week indicating that he would support the government. One rebel who said privately before the vote that he would side with the government but ultimately did not, explained why yesterday. He had changed his mind partly as a result of the eleventh-hour compensation package for pensioners that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, 'plucked out the air' to try to save the day. He argued that the package showed that the government had enough in hand not to need to raise the VAT rate on domestic fuel to 17.5 per cent. The bad blood created by Tuesday's rebellion and the charges of underhand tactics seemed yesterday to augur badly for the sort of two-way 'bridge-building' referred to by Mr Jonathan Aitken, the rightwing chief Treasury secretary. Mr Aitken said he was hoping for a period when 'tempers and fevers will cool' and the Conservatives got back to being 'a united party'. He said: 'You can't have a situation when people can go walkabout out of pique, or revenge, or feelings of high temper or whatever it was that was sending some of them into the rebel lobbies last night.' The view from the whip's office was that, after Tuesday, 'if you just slapped them on the wrist, there would be anarchy'. 'They could have started bridge-building last night,' said one business manager.</p>

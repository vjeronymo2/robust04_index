			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Quarterbacks on the wrong pitch The merit of co-operation between government, big business and unions seems an article of faith in the White House. The clearest sign of a tilt toward 'corporatist' policies was President Bill Clinton's recent announcement that the federal government would join forces with the Big Three American carmakers to develop a new generation of fuel-efficient supercars. 'We want to position the US auto industry to be the principal force in the marketplace of the next century,' said Mr Al Gore, the vice-president. He added that it was absurd that commercial carmakers were still dependent on the internal combustion engine, a technology dating from 1876. The Dollars 500m supercar initiative is the most visible element in an emerging web of industrial policies. The administration has allocated Dollars 1.5bn to help private companies create the world's first 'information superhighways'. It is showering subsidies on high-tech industries and even helping dinosaurs such as shipbuilding. To appease trade unions, there is talk of a substantial increase in the minimum wage and, conceivably, changes in labour laws to improve the bargaining position of workers. Spending on industrial policy is admittedly trivial in the context of a Dollars 1,500bn budget. But the economic culture in Washington is changing. The Competitiveness Policy Council, a corporatist coalition of business, union and government officials, is urging Mr Clinton to make competitiveness 'the centre-piece of US economic policymaking'. Excited by the deal with Detroit, it advocates a depressingly mushy set of policies, including tax subsidies for investment and regular doses of devaluation to ensure 'equitable' trading conditions for US companies. The council's chairman, Mr Fred Bergsten, also advocates 'managed' trade as a way of levering open foreign markets. Co-operation between government and business to improve competitiveness may seem harmless enough. Now that the cold war is over, the huge financial resources of the federal laboratories surely should be harnessed to commercial as well as military goals. In its quest for jobs and higher living standards, why shouldn't the White House serve as an inspirational 'quarterback' to US business? The pragmatic case against corporatism is that, if Washington throws its weight behind American business, Brussels and Tokyo are certain to respond in kind. Instead of the arms race of past decades, Mr Clinton could face an equally stupid subsidies race, with ever larger industrial handouts being required to offset the largesse of competitors. But there are also matters of principle at stake. Corporatism is a crude form of economic nationalism. The hard task for government today is surely to establish global rules and institutions that serve the economic interests of all individuals and companies - regardless of their origin or nationality. The best route is normally unhindered competition. In a market system, the government should be referee, not quarterback or coach. Competitiveness, in any case, is a dubious concept on which to build an economic strategy. The US can become more competitive only if other regions become less competitive. Should the US really make policies designed to reduce the competitiveness of Europe and Japan the centrepiece of economic policymaking, as Mr Bergsten's council suggests? Of course not: the federal government should concentrate on its fundamental economic duties, such as keeping inflation under control, balancing its budget and minimising the distortions imposed by taxes and regulations. Economic growth and the US's performance relative to other countries will be determined largely by factors beyond the control of politicians, such as private agents' propensity to work, save and take risks. To see how little competitiveness may depend on public policy, consider Mr Bergsten's own Institute for International Economics. It may be a non-profit-making body, but as a provider of economic services it is rather typical of the new information economy. It has to compete, moreover, with many similar think-tanks and institutes, both in the US and abroad. What makes Fred competitive? There are many factors, including the skills of his staff. But the most important is Mr Bergsten's own entrepreneurial flair. He makes shrewd judgments about the economic topics that are going to hit the headlines and markets his timely products aggressively. It is precisely the entrepreneurial ability to predict how consumer demand will change and to find cost-efficient ways of suppling new products that governs business success. Companies such as General Motors and IBM have run into trouble not because they lack talented staff or financial resources but because of a loss of entrepreneurial alertness. Competitiveness is a near obsession for the administration and allied groups such as Mr Bergsten's council. Yet their reams of analysis say little, if anything, about entrepreneurship. The emphasis on failings in public policy is so total that the actual process of wealth creation is almost entirely overlooked. You would never suspect from the literature on competitiveness that the US's surge to global economic dominance at the end of the 19th century occurred at a time when federal spending was 3 per cent, rather than 23 per cent, of GDP.</p>

			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Filipinos wrestle with message of birth control: The church is countering a government campaign with demonstrations Dr Juan Flavier, the Philippines' health secretary, has long been worried by runaway population growth in the Philippines, where four-fifths of the inhabitants are Roman Catholics forbidden by doctrine to use artificial methods of birth control. His campaign is to be challenged on Sunday with a big demonstration, called by Cardinal Jaime Sin, Archbishop of Manila, to express opposition to artificial contraception and abortion. The Cardinal's supporters say that 1m people are expected to take part and that the protesters will burn condoms and literature promoting safe sex. Dr Flavier has said people are welcome to listen to what the church has to say at the demonstration. But he believes that unrestricted population growth damages the health and wealth of parents and their numerous children (an estimated 60,000 mothers and babies die each year from problems encountered during pregnancy and childbirth) and depletes the country's already stretched natural resources. The Philippines' population of 66m is growing by about 2.5 per cent a year, one of the highest rates in Asia. Families with eight or more children are not uncommon. Palawan, one of the few islands in the archipelago where the forest has not been destroyed, is being invaded by thousands of migrants from other islands searching for farmland. 'Our mountains are denuded, devastated,' Dr Flavier said in an interview. 'We have erosion. Our rivers are getting polluted, our seas are getting polluted and now our watersheds are being damaged.' Far from being downcast by this gloomy picture, the extrovert Dr Flavier has energetically used every level of the media to put his health messages across - whether they concern birth control, Aids, immunisation or cancer. He plays the buffoon in lowbrow situation comedies on television, is interviewed on serious radio talk shows, and has a column in one of Manila's leading newspapers. He has often been compared with his friend, Mr Meechai Viravaidya, a former Thai government minister credited with helping to curb Thailand's population growth and the spread of Aids by publicising contraceptives and making them socially acceptable. His media antics and his family planning propaganda have sometimes enraged conservative Roman Catholics - including the powerful Opus Dei faction - and been criticised by his colleagues for threatening the dignity of the administration. 'The other government officials sort of frown on it,' Dr Flavier said. 'But my answer is: 'The hell with it, it's effective.'' Commenting on his television comedy appearances, he adds: 'People find it funny and so human that now they identify with our health programmes.' Dr Flavier is popular with the local press and with Filipinos in general, partly because they love show business and partly because he has no background in the corrupt world of what Filipinos call 'traditional politics'. For 31 years - until he was appointed by Mr Fidel Ramos two years ago - he worked as a doctor and promoted rural development programmes. His work in the countryside, where two-thirds of the people live, convinced him that most Filipinos - including, discreetly, many Roman Catholic priests  -supported artificial methods of birth control, a view endorsed by recent opinion surveys. Dr Flavier also discovered how to teach family planning to farmers with what he calls an 'agricultural analogy approach'. The spacing of children is likened to the spacing of rice plants that allows each plant to prosper. Acronyms and slogans are popular in the Philippines and Dr Flavier is adept at using them. The best-known is probably the ABC of safe sex. A is for Abstinence; if that does not work, then B is for Be faithful; if fidelity fails as well, then C is for Condom. With little government money at his disposal, Dr Flavier has turned without hesitation to big businesses to finance some of his projects. Soap companies sponsor hygiene campaigns, and Dr Flavier himself has appeared in a fast food chain's television advertisement that managed to publicise immunisation and hamburgers at the same time. But only the bravest of corporations would risk the wrath of the church in the Philippines by advertising contraceptives, and much of this family planning work is funded by foreign donors. The church has been quiet on the topic of contraception in recent months, but Dr Flavier and his allies know that next month's United Nations population conference in Cairo and the Pope's visit to the Philippines next January will be used as a rallying point by anti-birth control activists. During the last years of the previous administration of Corazon Aquino, a devout Roman Catholic, family planning in the Philippines suffered a setback. Dr Flavier says that 70 per cent of married women of reproductive age either want no more children or want to wait a couple of years before the next child, but only 40 per cent have access to contraceptives. Mr Ramos is from the Protestant minority, and Dr Flavier goes to church with his Protestant wife, but he says he does not want to make it a religious issue. He advertises natural as well as artificial methods of birth control and allows people make their own choice. 'I've won the media battle,' he says. 'I will go and work in the field now, and shy away from controversy in the upper crust of society because it's very divisive. At the top we're getting this flak, but below I'm not. Down there in the countryside I have no problem with priests; I have no problem with nuns.'</p>

			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Mrs Fields' shareholders left with just the crumbs / A look at the background to the financial restructuring of the US cookie maker THE HUMBLE all-American chocolate chip cookie does not travel well, as UK investors have found out to their expense. This week's news of a financial restructuring at Mrs Fields, the controversial USM-quoted cookie company, leaves 1,700 UK investors with nothing more than a nominal holding in a private company owned and managed by US banks. Shareholders have also been told that they can expect no dividend until the banks have been repaid. Just when that might be is still somewhat of an open question, even for the banks concerned. Most of those left holding what one shareholder called 'virtually worthless paper' are private individuals, with only three large UK institutions on the register. Ignoring the warning bells of a disastrous flotation in the spring of 1986, they rushed to buy in the following year amid the hype of one product wonder stocks such as Sock Shop and Tie Rack. The company's ability to meet the forecast on which it was floated was taken as a good sign. Its shares rose from a low of 105p to 272p in June 1987, against a flotation price of 140p. Within months, however, cracks in the company's strategy began to appear. An ambitious expansion programme was reversed as rents soared, branches languished and the economy took a nosedive. Little more than four years after its market debut, Mrs Fields was forced to sit down with bankers to hammer out a survival strategy. This week it became clear that the company has been all but bankrupt for some time, in spite of a shift toward less capital intensive franchising and licensing operations. One significant UK shareholder said it had written the investment off in 1990, a year before the shares were suspended at 10p. The agreement announced on Monday has taken two years to negotiate. Mrs Fields, the high profile founder of the company, and her husband, Randall, had already pledged most of their 80 per cent stake to the banks to keep the business afloat. But the banks will return control of an 8.4 per cent stake to her over the next three years as long as she remains with the company. Mrs Fields will remain as chairwoman, albeit on a slightly reduced salary of Dollars 450,000 a year. The banks have decided apparently that to lose her face from marketing campaigns would be like losing Anita Roddick from the Body Shop, said one observer. This logic was also behind the decision to cancel 'interaffiliate' debts of Dollars 14.5m (Pounds 10.2m) - basically monies owed by companies controlled by the Fields. Her husband, who resigned as chairman in March 1991, has also had his compensation package reduced. For shareholders, there is little solace in the terms agreed by the banks. After the refinancing, the group will still have debt of Dollars 50m with a Dollars 64.5m deficit in shareholders funds. It is certain to be some time before even the banks can begin to think of getting a return.</p>

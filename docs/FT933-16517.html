			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Moslems struggle to fend off Serb-Croat offensive MOSLEM fighters yesterday struggled to fend off a joint Serb and Croat offensive on key strongholds in north central Bosnia. In another bid to block the delivery of humanitarian aid to besieged Moslem communities, Serb fighters demanded a tanker of fuel before allowing the passage of an emergency convoy which on Wednesday was stopped near Sarajevo. UN relief officials said Serb commanders had given guarantees that they would suspend a Dollars 500 (Pounds 333) toll for aid lorries imposed earlier this week. Croatian radio said the Croatian Defence Council (HVO) had 'destroyed' the Moslem attempts to defend Zepce, where more than 100 people were reported to have ben killed in the fighting. UN officials said up to 10,000 Moslems yesterday streamed out of the region, under constant attack by Serb forces They were reportedly heading towards Zenica, one of six UN 'safe areas' in Bosnia. The fall of Zepce to Croat forces was another setback for the Moslems, pinned between their powerful foes. Serb forces are concentrated to the north apparently intent on carving out a second land corridor through central Bosnia, connecting Serb-held territories. After seizing Zepce, Serb and Croat forces tightened their stranglehold on nearby Maglaj and Zavidovici. They are now poised to deal another blow to the enclaves of Zenica and Tuzla, further isolated by the latest advance. Recent fighting has made impossible the delivery of humanitarian relief to the two Moslem strongholds, supposedly under UN protection. Relief workers fear that hundreds of thousands of Moslems stranded in the 'safe areas' will be cut off aid. Mr Veso Vegar, HVO spokesman, said 150 people had been killed when HVO units seized control of Zepce. He denied reports that Croat and Serb forces had entered into a powerful alliance against the outgunned Moslems. Meanwhile Yugoslavia, now comprising Serbia and Montenegro, yesterday said it would not extend the mandate for the mission of the Council for Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) to monitor the rights of minorities in the unrecognised Balkan federation. The move was in apparent retaliation for Yugoslavia's suspension from the CSCE last year for supporting the carve-up of Bosnia.</p>

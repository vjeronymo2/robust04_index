			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 25 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam,  after receiving an enthusiastic reception from both houses of  the Japanese Diet Thursday [day as received], delivered a speech  in a voice brimming with confidence.    His speech concentrated on the past, present and future of  relations between the two neighbors.    Led by the speaker of the Lower House, Masako Doi, Kim and  his wife, Son Myong-sun, entered the Diet hall to a standing  ovation. He responded with gentle waves.    During his 20-minute speech, Kim was interrupted by applause  14 times. Many Japanese lawmakers nodded with approval when the  South Korean president emphasized that his country and Japan  will have to work together for peace and prosperity in the Asia  and Pacific region.    Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa sat in his  assigned  seat in the Lower House while Doi and other parliamentary  leaders sat on the right side of the podium and members of Kim's  entourage, on the left.    Kim waved from the podium when all members of parliament  stood up and applauded at the end of his speech.    Prior to his speech, Doi told the president that "Korea was  the first country in the world to invent metal printing type and  Japan has learned a great deal of cultural traditions from  Korea."    "Japan's extreme action once created tension between our two  countries but by looking at our past correctly and reflecting on  it, we have to restore mutual trust," she said.    After giving his speech, Kim chatted briefly with Doi and  the  president of the Upper House of the Diet.    "President Kim's gait is very strong and full of vitality,"  Doi told the Korean visitor. "We all listened to your speech in  an exciting atmosphere," she added.    Later, Doi led Kim to the upper house president's chamber  where they met with more than 70 Japanese parliamentary leaders  and representatives of political parties. Welcoming Kim  "whole-heartedly," Doi proposed a champagne toast, and Kim  responded that he was happy and honored to have delivered a  speech at one of the most well-known landmarks in Asia.    South Korean-Japanese relations have experienced  difficulties  because of an overemphasis on the past, Kim said. "(but) let us  work together to open a new era of Korea-Japan relations," he  said.</p>

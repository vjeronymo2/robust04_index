			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / International Company News: Air Canada fails to agree plan for merger AIR Canada has failed to agree terms for a merger with rival Canadian Airlines International, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. The terms of a pre-merger agreement made by Air Canada and PWA, parent of Canadian, on October 8 'contained conditions that cannot be met'. The deal is 'unachievable', Air Canada said. Under the merger plan, Air Canada and Canadian would have continued as separate entities while a new holding company would have been formed with shareholders of each group exchanging their stock for new shares in the holding company.</p>

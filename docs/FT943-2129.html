			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Lloyd's 'costly' advisers attacked A leading underwriter yesterday attacked the 'amazing Pounds 500m per year' that the Lloyd's of London insurance market spends on outside advisers who assist in handling insurance claims. Mr Mark Brockbank, who is chief underwriter to the largest Lloyd's syndicate, told a conference in Singapore that the expenditure must be reduced. 'Our control over these costs has, quite frankly, been lamentable,' he said. 'However, I am determined that this situation should change.' Lloyd's handled around Pounds 7bn in claims last year. Those involved in claims assistance include lawyers, accountants, surveyors and loss adjustors. Mr Brockbank said: 'We must begin to set out formal terms of reference and not be shy about discussing rates, estimates and, in certain cases, require tendering in those we employ. 'In failing to do this we have been too gentlemanly. This cannot continue, because while we have good relationships with many of our advisers, you are our clients and it is you who end up paying the bill in future rates for this approach.' He said the NewCo project, a reinsurance company being set up by Lloyd's to ring fence liabilities incurred before 1986, was a positive initiative which would allow the market to keep control of its costs. Mr Brockbank also urged underwriters to take 'a more proactive role in the claims process' by appointing adjusters empowered to approve certain repairs and expenses. While Lloyd's prided itself on paying all legitimate claims, 'unnecessarily delayed payment is almost as unacceptable as non-payment of claims', he said. In an interview later, Mr Brockbank identified legal fees as 'by far the biggest cost component'. He also listed marine hull insurance as another problem area for excess costs. 'We are just taking for granted how we do our business . . . This is an area where we have to make some progress, and the sheer amount of money being spent by the market will ensure that it is addressed.'</p>

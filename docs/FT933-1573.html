			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Book Review: Nice man - shame about the tie WILSON, THE AUTHORISED LIFE By Philip Ziegler Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, Pounds 20, 593 pages 'Into the un-settled England of the 1820s the locomotive burst its way.' So wrote the young Harold Wilson in the opening sentence of his prize-winning Gladstone Memorial Essay on The State and the Railways in Great Britain (1823-63) at Oxford University in the 1930s, though the rest of the essay, we are told, was rather less high-powered. It sounds remarkably like his subsequent career in politics. Wilson was the most exciting leader of the opposition in postwar Britain. He was not the most exciting prime minister. (That was Margaret Thatcher.) After the initial bursts of steam, there were long cooling-off periods. Yet Wilson still casts a spell over the British scene. There have been more books about him, several of them written by himself, than any other British prime minister since 1945, if you count Churchill as essentially a wartime leader. It is no disparagement of the earlier efforts to say that Philip Ziegler's is the best so far. This is partly because Ziegler has had access to some private papers previously unavailable, partly because he is an accomplished and experienced biographer and partly because he has drawn, very sensibly and with full acknowledgements, on the books that have gone before. The sections on Wilson's early life in particular are fuller and more authentic than in any earlier volume. Ziegler has also drawn intriguingly on dispatches from the American Embassy in London, which has always kept a close watch on British politics. Do not, however, expect anything sensationally new. For Ziegler, like his predecessors, has ducked the main question. That is how good, or how bad, a prime minister Wilson was. Could anyone else have done better in the circumstances of the time? One can see why the question is constantly avoided. Wilson came in with such high expectations in 1964 and went out with such a low reputation in 1976 that to upgrade him now would compel a big revaluation of his successors, and of Edward Heath in between. If someone were to argue now that Harold Wilson was the best British prime minister in the past 30 years, it would make his successors look dire indeed. Probably he wasn't. Yet if you look at the problems he had to face, he wasn't all that bad, and if you look at the circumstances of Britain today you may well conclude that not so much has changed. Wilson had one problem peculiar to his time and not of his own making. That was Vietnam. It was especially hard for the Labour party, some of which was anti-American and anti-war of any kind. It coincided with, and to some extent led to, a wave of student unrest which was not confined to Britain. Those were not propitious times for a left-of-centre government, though one wonders how a Tory administration would have responded to American requests for military assistance. Yet most of the problems of the Wilson era look depressingly familiar. The prime minister's long fight to stave off devaluation in the mid-1960s is remarkably similar to John Major's clinging to the exchange rate mechanism last year. The Labour party quarrelled over Europe then just like the Tories today. Even the calls for a referendum strike a chord. As for the challenges to the leadership and the conspiratorial atmosphere, who is to say that the Tories in the 1990s come out any better? Mrs Thatcher apart, Labour leaders on the whole survive longer. Even where Wilson failed, as in trade union reform, he set the way for changes later. Heath failed on that score as well, but the very process of trying made it easier for Mrs Thatcher. It was the same on Rhodesia which inevitably took so much of Wilson's time and would equally have absorbed any other British prime minister. By concentrating on the biography of the man rather than the history of the time, Ziegler tends to underestimate the difficulties that Wilson faced. As in Ben Pimlott's even longer biography last year, there is no final judgment of Wilson's place in British politics, and one suspects that the reason is that no one is yet quite sure. It may depend on whether there is ever again a Labour government. Where Ziegler comes up trumps is on the personal side. Wilson may have had his quirks and foibles, latterly even a mild paranoia, but he was essentially a decent man, liked by most who worked with him. This is Ziegler's main conclusion after four years of research: 'There were few surprises . . . what did impress me far more than I expected was his extraordinary niceness.' It was said of him initially that he was an exceptionally boring man. A politician needed to make the odd joke, so Wilson picked up a sense of humour on the job. He did it very well. When he protested to the BBC that it was keeping potential Labour voters at home by showing Steptoe and Son during the last hour of polling in the 1964 election, the director-general asked him what should be put in its place. 'Oedipus Rex,' he replied. Steptoe was postponed. Wilson was the only British prime minister this century apart from Stanley Baldwin to resign voluntarily. Baldwin was 69 and very deaf. Wilson was under 60 and relatively fit. He had acquired a reputation for deviousness which is why even those who were told in advance did not believe that he would really go. Yet anyone who presides over a political party as long as Wilson must have a talent to finesse. At the final cabinet meeting Tony Benn tried to take a photograph of the outgoing leader, but was deterred. 'It was just a non-event,' Benn recorded, 'like a civil servant reaching the age of 60 and retiring.' He was probably more right than he knew. There was a lot of the civil servant in Wilson, and, on the politics, as Randolph Churchill wrote to Wilson in 1964: 'The Leader's tie is palest pink, It's not as red as people think.'</p>

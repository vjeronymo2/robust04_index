			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: UK insurance Mr Lamont also held out a little noticed but juicy carrot for the UK insurance industry. Insurers have long argued for the right to set aside tax-deductible general reserves against unspecified future losses. The Budget gave them cause for celebration by promising a consultation paper on the issue. Swings in profits caused by natural catastrophes could be ironed out by such equalisation reserves. European insurers enjoy a competitive advantage in the London market by being allowed to create them. Yet there is plenty of scope for disappointment in the fine print. Equalisation reserves would be of little value if they were restricted to minor classes of business. The big gains would flow from reserves against future losses on property and household accounts. Only then would shareholders funds be protected from hurricanes or deep recessions. If the government and the Inland Revenue are prepared to go that far, insurance companies may be more inclined to maintain dividends through the cycle and the sector would be a less volatile investment. The industry will still have to argue its case. Smoothing profits goes against the grain of recent UK accounting reforms. The continental practice of setting up general reserves discourages transparency. Insurance companies which are free to reserve to the hilt on the upswing may also be tempted to write bad business in difficult markets. Far from smoothing the insurance cycle, equalisation reserves would then only add to the problem.</p>

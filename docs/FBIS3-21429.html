			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [All quotation marks as published] </F>   [Text] Bonn, February 4--The Indian government is  "seriously considering" doing away with the situation that  foreign equity should cover the foreign exchange requirement for  import of capital goods under the automatic approval category,  as part of ongoing liberalisation process, UNI reports.    This has been conveyed by the Prime Minister, Mr P.V.  Narasimha Rao, in the Indian government's reply to the "Kohl  memorandum" sent to New Delhi after the German Chancellor, Dr  Helmut Kohl's visit to India in February last year.    The memorandum, entitled `Proposals on Economic Policies and  Procedures of the Government of India', was forwarded by the  Chancellor in July last year.    Some of the other proposals for further liberalisation, made  in the memorandum and under active consideration of the  government, are:    --Liberalisation of the pharmaceutical and chemical  industry;    --Removal of the phased manufacturing programme obligations  for units established prior to the new industrial policy;    --Increasing the prescribed payment limits for automatic  approvals of technical collaborations;    --Amendment of the Industrial Disputes Act.    The government's reply to the memorandum also states that on  some other issues, such as enforceability of foreign awards, the  government had an "open mind" and was willing to consider the  matter.    The Indian reply to the memorandum was given to the German  government a few days before Mr Rao's arrival on a state visit  here.    The Indian reply states that it must be appreciated as a  fundamental point relating to the issues raised in the "Kohl  memorandum" that since the process of reforms was initiated  several policy changes had been progressively made and  procedures increasingly streamlined to improve the business  environment in the country.    The reply adds that several of the proposals made in the  memorandum were already under implementation. They were  identified as:    --To decrease the number of industries reserved for the  public sector;    --Faster clearance for applications under the EPCG [Export  Promotion Capital Goods] scheme;    --Negotiation of more favourable double-taxation agreement;    --More liberal procedures for payment of foreign  technicians;    --Long duration purchase agreements for power and secured  fuel supplies for such projects;    --Equal opportunities for manufacturers in the telecom  sector.    Under six broad classifications, the memorandum put forward  suggestions on a vast range of areas and subjects such as  desirability of a "negative" list; speeding up of state  governments' proposals; uniform industrial policy in the states;  remittance facilities for foreign nationals; disinvestment  procedures; and governing law and arbitration for contracts  entered into with foreign parties.    PTI adds: Leading political parties in Germany  have assured India that the new `Asia concept' unveiled by the  Chancellor, Dr Helmut Kohl, with India as a target country for  intensified bilateral cooperation and embracing a wide range of  fields, would be honoured irrespective of which party came to  power in this year's elections there.    This assurance was conveyed to Mr Rao, when a series of  important German political leaders called on him here yesterday.    An official spokesman said that by and large there was "a  multi-party support" to Dr Kohl's new `Asia concept', as Germany  has willingly recognised that Japan, China and India in Asia  would be the important political and economic powers in the  coming years.    The important German leaders who called on Mr Rao included  Mr  Hans Ulrich Klose, chairman of the parliamentary group of  Socialist Democratic Party, Dr Wolfgang Schauble, chairman of  the parliamentary group of the Christian Democratic Party, and  Dr Hermann Otto Solms, chairman of Free Democratic Party.    Meanwhile, Mr Rao reached the historic city of Berlin this  afternoon on the last leg of his six-day tour to Davos and  Germany.    Mr Rao is scheduled to meet the German President, Mr Richard  von Weizsaecker, besides opening the cultural festival programme  at the Indian cultural centre there tomorrow.</p>

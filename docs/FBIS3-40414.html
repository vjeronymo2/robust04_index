			<p>Language: <F P=105>French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Pierre Langereux: "French Cruise Missiles With </F> Conventional or Nuclear Warheads"; introductory paragraph in  boldface as published]    [Text] American, Russian, and French (Matra) missile  manufacturers are vying to dominate the market for "upscale"  interceptor missiles. In France, Aerospatiale and Matra are  dueling over a conventional cruise missile with a range of 400  km. But Aerospatiale is also working on a long-range supersonic  nuclear air-to-surface missile (ASLP) whose first launchings  will take place in 1996-1997.    Aerospatiale Missiles and Matra Defense are competing to  produce an air-to-surface cruise missile with conventional  warhead that will be offered to the French Air Force as an  "anti-infrastructure" missile for use against tactical,  strategic, or even "political" targets as an "inhibiting warning  shot." Each firm has already received a 20-million-franc  contract for preliminary studies. But they have also invested  their own money in this new missile, development of which could  begin in 1994.    Matra Defense is proposing a missile derived from the  subsonic air-to-surface Apache and known as the Apache-C, while  Aerospatiale is putting its money on an adaptation of the  medium-range nuclear air-to-surface missile (ASMP), whose  nuclear warhead has been replaced by a conventional payload in  this new version known as the ASMP-C (see AIR &amp; COSMOS Nos.  1429  and 1432).    The ASMP-C would be lighter (885 kg) than the Apache-C  (1,230  kg) and would also carry a smaller payload (240 kg compared to  400 kg). But Aerospatiale's missile (propelled by a ramjet with  integrated-powder booster) is supersonic and thus from two to  three times faster (Mach 2.2 to 2.3) than the subsonic  turbojet-propelled Apache (Mach 0.8). In other words, the ASMP-C  would take only seven minutes to cover the maximum range of 400  km, compared to 32 minutes for the Apache-C. According to their  manufacturers, both missiles (with varying degrees of stealth  capability) are equally accurate in the final phase (to within  one to three meters).    Actually, the "conventional" ASMP retains the rear and  middle  sections of the original air-to-surface missile with no  modification. Only the forward tip is replaced by a "hardened"  payload from the AS30L and a guidance system with computer and  infrared homing head adapted from the one used on an air-to-air  missile developed by the SAT.    According to the project's chief engineer--who asked to  remain anonymous--the only genuinely new component is in fact  the onboard computer (adapted for ground attack), whose specific  image processing software was developed jointly by Aerospatiale  and the SAT. Those firms are awaiting notification early in 1994  that they can begin a program for demonstrating the feasibility  of the missile's guidance system in both the inertial and then  the self-guided phase and in its different attack trajectories  (flight profile at high and/or low altitude). This will be done  using digital simulations and demonstrations on a three-axis  bench under the direction of Aerospatiale in cooperation with  the LRBA [Ballistic and Aerodynamic Research Laboratory].    In particular, it will be necessary to test a computer  mockup  (with parallel architecture and prewired operators) and a  prototype homing head (mechanical scanning) with a liquid  nitrogen-cooled infrared detector (3-5 microns). According to  the project manager, plans call for testing the guidance system  on the ground for a year before testing it in flight (on an  aircraft) for 1.5 years. But, he says, "if we were given  authorization tomorrow for a demonstration program with ground  targets, we would be ready to launch guided missiles within 18  months!"    The reason is that the ASMP-C could benefit from synergy  with  the "mid-life modernization" program covering the ASMP missiles  that went into service between 1986 and 1991 (there are over 80  of them). That program, which will last for several years,  should begin in 1994, and according to a recent Senate report,  it will keep the ASMP's operational until 2007.    According to Aerospatiale, the ASMP-C could therefore be  developed more quickly and less expensively than the Apache-C,  whose development cost is estimated at "less than 1 billion  francs" by Matra. According to the project manager,  "Aerospatiale's missile would be easier to develop because it  employs a simpler propulsion system (ramjet) and does not  require mid-flight correction." The Apache-C, on the other hand,  uses dual-mode guidance with an infrared camera for the final  resetting of Thomson-CSF's Promethee radar.    Aerospatiale also feels that its missile, "like any ramjet  missile, would be less expensive to manufacture than the Apache  in equal quantities and at the same rate of production."  Aerospatiale estimated earlier that for a limited production run  (from 200 to 300 missiles), the ASMP-C would cost 10 million  francs per unit, whereas Matra placed the cost of the Apache-C  at 6 million francs (see AIR &amp; COSMOS Nos. 1429 and 1432).    Aerospatiale is also proposing to use the ramjet  air-to-surface missile as the basis for an entire family of  airborne supersonic missiles with a range of 400 km. That family  would consist of the ASMP-R--an anti-AWACS aircraft/radar  missile equipped with a dual-mode (active and passive) radar  homing head produced by Dassault Electronic--and the ASMP-M,  which would be equipped with the radar homing head used on the  Exocet Mk2 and the same warhead as that used on the ANS  [supersonic antiship missile]. The French Navy seems interested  in that supersonic antiship (actually multirole) missile, and it  is thought that Germany might even join (again) in its  development. The technical dossier is to be submitted to the DGA  [General Delegation for Weapons] at the start of 1994!    The ASMP-C can be launched from various platforms (aircraft,  ships, submarines, or vehicles) and modified (by lengthening the  fuel tank) to increase its range (+800 km from a high-altitude  launch) in a slightly heavier version (about 1,050 kg). Matra is  also proposing a version of the Apache-C with a longer range  (+600 km).    Concerning the current Apache (air-to-surface with a range  of  140 km), Matra has announced that test flights of complete  missiles (propelled, guided, and with submunitions ejected) will  begin at the CEL [Landes Testing Center] in mid-1994 using a  Mirage-2000 from the Flight Test Center. The company points out  that the missile will be certified for the Mirage-2000D in 1996  and available in mass-produced quantities at the start of 1997.  <H3>  In-Flight Launchings in 1996-1997 of the ASLP Nuclear Cruise  Missile </H3>   The project to develop the ASLP, a nuclear-armed supersonic  cruise missile, has not been abandoned. This despite the recent  British decision to withdraw from the strategic nuclear  air-to-surface missile project, which France was hoping to  develop jointly with Great Britain as a replacement for Great  Britain's 80 to 100 WE177 airborne atomic bombs and France's  ASMP medium-range air-to-surface missiles.    AIR &amp; COSMOS has learned that the DGA gave its approval  early  in December for continuing exploratory development work on the  ASLP. That work has been in progress since 1987.    The chief engineer for Aerospatiale's nuclear missile  program--who wishes to remain anonymous--confirmed to us that  the government agency had asked the firm to begin a four-year  exploratory development program to produce complete missiles and  to conduct the first flight tests with that platform (without a  nuclear warhead) in 1996-1997.    On that subject, a recent Senate report authored by Senator  Jacques Golliet expresses the feeling that "flexibility of the  airborne component is particularly well adapted to the strategic  situation and to changes in the threat at the operational and  political levels." And further on that subject, Golliet notes  that "many factors (ramjet performance, accuracy, stealth,  multirole capability, suitability for strategic or prestrategic  missions, and a desire to upgrade the Rafale) argue in favor of  developing and having ready by around 2005 or 2007 a successor  to the ASMP that will have a longer range and carry a nuclear  warhead ranging from a few kilotons to 300 kT."    The report also recommends "rounding out the components of  our nuclear potential by the addition of a cruise missile  equipped with a low-powered or variable-energy nuclear warhead  or even one with dual capability: both nuclear and  conventional," like the U.S. Tomahawk.    Aerospatiale has already designed an ASLP version carrying a  conventional warhead. According to the project's chief engineer,  "it would be possible by around 2010 or 2015 to have a cruise  missile that is completely autonomous (requiring not even GPS  correction) and accurate to within a few meters, with a range  four or five times greater than that of the ASMP." The ASMP has  a range of from 150 to 300 km, depending on launch altitude.</p>

			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Accountancy: Young, free and single-mindedly deceptive - A look at the implications for firms supervising staff after the Nicholas Young case The high-spending existence of Nicholas Young came to an abrupt and unpleasant end one summer's day four years ago with his arrest by the police. Life for those around him has altered just as painfully but rather more slowly and less conclusively since then. From 1974, Young had held the senior administrative role at an organisation known latterly as Clark Kenneth Leventhal (CKL), an international network of accountancy firms including Clark Whitehill in the UK. But he was spending much of his time in and out of Clark Whitehill's London offices dealing with 'investors' - including his mother and friends - to whom he promised high returns from a series of complex and confidential funds invested offshore. Young, the son of the Queen's chaplain, spent some of the money on his extravagant personal lifestyle, and frittered away the rest on an elaborate and ultimately futile horse-racing betting system. He spent more than Pounds 10.9m on bets since 1985 alone, recouping just Pounds 8.7m. One of the many ironies of the Young saga is that his ambitious deception could take place on the premises and under the very noses of a number of highly skilled audit partners at Clark Whitehill, which numbers among its clients the Financial Reporting Council. Another is the fact that Young himself had previously held the position as assistant secretary of the disciplinary committee at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. This very body has just delivered its verdict on Mr Brian Worth, Young's supervisor. One of the great sadnesses of the story is that while the criminal action has proved relatively swift, the pursuit of professional discipline and civil compensation have proved tortuously slow. Young was jailed for four years in 1991 after being found guilty on charges of making misleading, false and deceptive statements, and deception and forgery. Within 19 months he was free. That leaves more than 60 investors out of pocket by more more than Pounds 8.5m. Five have since died. With no chance of recovering their money from Young, the survivors have launched legal actions against CKL and Clark Whitehill, both of which deny responsibility. The case is now scheduled to begin in January 1996. Meanwhile, last week an appeal upheld last year's verdict of the Institute's disciplinary committee against Mr Worth, a Clark Whitehill partner and the chairman of CKL at the time the deceptions were unearthed. He was 'admonished' and ordered to pay costs of Pounds 1,000 for his failure to adequately supervise Young. The committee concluded that Worth had not made 'adequate inquiries' of Young, and the resulting 'incompetence' was 'of such a degree that it would have caused concern and surprise to most right-thinking members of the public'. The question is not so much whether Mr Worth, Clark Whitehall and CKL knew about Young's fraud in advance of his arrest, but whether they should have discovered it long before the unexpected arrival of a writ from the first of many disgruntled investors in 1990. There have to be at the very least some questions about the gullibility of the Young investors. His promises sound all too familiar to a public now more used to the financial shenanigans of the late 1980s: inadequately explained and ridiculously high returns, the need to maintain utter discretion, the lack of any authorisation from a professional body, and the amateurish style of many of his circulars to investors. But the victims do have one powerful retort: they maintain that Young had the necessary credibility partly because he appeared to be working on behalf of a reputable firm of chartered accountants rather than simply in his personal capacity. There are many letters written by Young to his 'clients' on letterheads from the firm. There are numerous telephone messages and other signs that he took numerous calls at work. The relatively small amount of stationery used in these unauthorised ways might have been difficult for the firm to detect. The forged representations that he periodically made in partners' names would prove even more opaque to unearth. The apparent volume of correspondence and callers at the firm's offices might have raised some suspicions, however. It seems that letters sent there included tipsters' sheets with names such as 'Tru-tu-form'. None of his post was opened by others, which might have triggered suspicions. The partners seemed to make few inquiries into how Young was able to finance his lifestyle - apparently spending more than Pounds 1m a year - when he earned a relatively modest CKL salary. More concerning is the fact that no-one picked up on the scale or nature of his activities at the lunches hosted by Young for both Clark Whitehill partners and outside contacts such as potential investors and bankers who were involved in his private client dealings. Young even had such correspondence with a manager at the Bank of Scotland in Edinburgh who is the brother of Mr Jim Gemmel, the firm's managing partner. One partner connected to CKL did have a closer understanding of what was going on. Mr Bengt Bangstad, head of the network's Swedish firm, who is now being sued by the investors, confirmed in a letter to a potential investor in 1987 that Young was providing him with investment returns in excess of 21 per cent a year. He apparently did not pass this information on to other partners. Separately, an Isle of Man accountant also wrote to Mr Worth in 1989 making inquiries on behalf of a client interested in a high-yielding investment, and saying that he had as a reference Young as the relevant 'partner' with Clark Whitehill. The issue of most concern to the Institute's disciplinary committee seems to have been the evidence that Young was carrying out private activities at his office. He paid CKL Pounds 750 a month, rising to Pounds 800, for use of space and equipment for his own work. The amounts are shown in the accounts. An accounts clerk queried these payments in 1985. Brian Worth says he did so more recently. Both received replies from Young that he paid bills and performed clerical work for a number of unidentified friends based overseas. Neither pursued the matter. The disciplinary committee concluded that Mr Worth had a responsibility to supervise all Young's activities, including his private ones, and should not have relied on his initial 'inadequate explanation'. It seems that Young also paid his successive secretaries a top-up each month for carrying out his personal work. They were aware of the nature of his private work, although it seems did not speak to anyone else in the firm about it. Mr Jim Gemmel argues that the amounts paid by Young to CKL were immaterial in view of the organisation's turnover, that that he was a trusted employee whom no-one had cause to disbelieve and who was an extremely artful deceiver, and that Worth was based in Birmingham with the supervision of Young in London just a small part of his role. 'You can be awfully clever with hindsight,' he says. 'I really do not think any other professional walking into these circumstances would have done anything different.' How far the courts agree may be unclear for another 16 months or more. In the meantime, other firms would do well to note the attitude of the disciplinary committee, and to consider their own procedures for monitoring the activities of staff, opening correspondence, supervising secretaries and generally keeping their eyes open. As Mr Gemmel says: 'I keep thinking, there but for the grace of God go I'</p>

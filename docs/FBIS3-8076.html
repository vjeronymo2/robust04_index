After talks with General Rose in Sarajevo's Serb suburb of  Lukavica, General Mladic stressed the fact that the Bosnian  Serbs had placed their most important [word indistinct] in the  Sarajevo area under U.N. control and expressed satisfaction  that the UNPROFOR commander was "aware that the Moslems have  again breached agreement and declined to withdraw any part of  their infantry."    "I think it is good that General Rose insists on a balance  of  power and urges that the Moslem side should make reciprocal  moves," he added.    "I hope UNPROFOR will influence the Moslems to realize that  they cannot expect the peacekeepers or NATO to wage war for them  and that they should come to the negotiating table and settled  disputes by political means. Before that, I don't believe  anybody could guarantee the realization of their crazy idea  about a multi-ethnic, multi-confessional or Islamic country on  Serb territory," Mladic said.    The agreement reached by the Croats and Moslems to form a  federation in Bosnia is welcome if it is striving towards peace  but it would not be good if this is not the case, said General  Mladic.    "We are ready for both," he said and added that the  avoidance  of the Moslem military commanders to meet with the Serb side  indicated that they were still hoping to get somebody on their  side to fight for their goals.    Top military officers of the Bosnian Serb and Moslem armies  were expected to meet at Sarajevo airport on Thursday to discuss  ceasefire and free movement of civilians in the Sarajevo area  but Moslem Commander Rasim Delic did not arrive to the meeting.    After talks with Mladic, General Rose voiced optimism in  view  of the restoration of peace in Sarajevo.    Rose said the bridge linking the Serb suburb of Grbavica and  the Moslem part of Sarajevo was now open only for UNPROFOR  troops and vehicles.    Talks on free passage of vehicles of the United Nations High  Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) are also under way, he added.</p>

			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Liffe and marketmakers resolve argument THE LONDON International Financial Futures Exchange has resolved an argument with marketmakers which threatened to sabotage its merger with the London Traded Options Market, allowing the merger to proceed as planned on Sunday. Mr David Burton, Liffe's chairman, flew back on Friday from the Futures Industry Association's annual meeting in Boca Raton, Florida, where he was due to speak, in order to help patch up differences with the six firms which had agreed to make markets in individual stock options under the new exchange. Throughout its four-year history, the merger has been dogged by disagreements over the best way to resurrect the UK market in individual stock options, which languished under the control of the stock exchange. The firms had threatened not to sign up as marketmakers unless Liffe agreed to appoint a managing director to oversee the development of the stock options market under the new exchange. Without marketmakers the merger would have been effectively sabotaged. The Liffe board decided to resist strong pressure from the marketmakers, even at the cost of the merger, on the grounds that the merger itself would be meaningless if the futures and options markets were run separately. At the eleventh hour, the marketmakers backed down in return for assurances on the running of the market. A detailed business plan for the equity options market will be completed in May. 'A compromise was cobbled together,' said one marketmaker. Speaking after Friday's board meeting, Mr Michael Jenkins, chief executive of Liffe, described the merger as 'a genuinely difficult task. We have all been struggling to find a way forward.' The merger was postponed in January because an insufficient number of firms came forward to make markets in the 67 equity options traded on LTOM. While hopes are running high for the FT-SE index option contract, there seems little sign that the merger will provide any immediate boost for individual stock options. The UK lags other European stock options markets. Volume in French and German stock options represents around 20 per cent of the volume traded in the cash market, while UK stock option volume totals a mere four per cent of the UK stock market. But Mr Jenkins thought that changes to the structure of the market would help to boost trading. 'I believe that the new market making arrangements, coupled with changes in stock borrowing and taxation relief, offer the potential for a competitive and liquid market,' he said.</p>

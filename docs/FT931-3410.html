			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / International Company News: Losses deepen at Aerospatiale FRANCE'S two leading aircraft makers yesterday provided further evidence of the problems afflicting the industry. Aerospatiale revealed a loss of between FFr1.5bn (Dollars 265m) and FFr2bn for last year, and Dassault Aviation forecast a small profit on reduced turnover this year. In an interview with Les Echos, published yesterday, Mr Louis Gallois, president of state-owned Aerospatiale, said that the losses, after a first-half deficit of FFr477m, had deepened in the last six months of 1992. Turnover last year was FFr51bn, but Mr Gallois forecast that 1993 would be 'a year of dead water, without dramas but without any pick-up in the market'. Dassault executives said the company's turnover would fall about 10 per cent this year from the FFr14.4bn level recorded in the past two years. However, profit would be of the same order of around FFr100m achieved in 1992 and 1991 because the company had cut costs and personnel, with the latter falling to 10,000 by end-1993. But the Dassault officials were more optimistic about the company's medium-term future. Orders booked last year rose to FFr21.5bn, thanks largely to the sale of 60 Mirage 2000-5 fighters to Taiwan, a contract which Dassault coyly still refuses to confirm publicly because of China's hostile reaction to the deal. By 1995, when Dassault's new range of business jet, the Falcon 2000, starts rolling off the production line, the company expects turnover to start rising again. Senior Dassault executives said it might be 'a good idea' if the new conservative government, which is expected to take power after this month's elections, were to include the company in its privatisation programme and sell some of the French state's 46 per cent stake in the company. Sextant Avionique, the avionics joint venture between Aerospatiale and Thomson CS, also forecast its turnover would continue to fall this year. But, like Dassault Aviation, it recorded an increase in orders booked last year.</p>

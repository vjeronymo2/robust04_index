			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS;  </P> <P> TIP TO INFREQUENT FLIER  </P> <P> Question: Although I don't travel frequently, does it make sense to join an  airline frequent-flier program?  </P> <P> Answer: Even if you never earn enough mileage to collect an award, signing up  generally will put you on the airline's mailing list for special offers that  are extended to program members, but not always to the general public. These  offers include travel, cruise, hotel and car-rental discounts.  </P> <P> Q: I've noticed more and more hotels are offering concierge or executive-level  floors. What is the difference between these and the rest of the hotel, and how  do the prices compare?  </P> <P> A: Many concierge and executive floors have separate check-in areas, plus  private lounges and meeting facilities. While room size may not be different,  these rooms typically have the latest amenities, with some including a  complimentary continental breakfast, newspapers and sometimes a cocktail hour.  Expect to pay between $20 and $80 extra per night.  </P> <P> Q: One day the airlines add fuel surcharges, reasoning the price of jet fuel  has gone up. The next day I see they are cutting fares. What's going on?  </P> <P> A: The fare cut you're speaking of was mainly limited to European destinations  for the winter months, when vacation travel slows down and the airlines try to  lure extra business by lowering prices. However, as the price of jet fuel rises  substantially, fuel surcharges also apply to these fares.  </P> <P> Q: Will there be a charge if I cancel a hotel reservation that is guaranteed by  credit card before 6 p.m. the day I'm due?  </P> <P> A: Hotels have varying cancellation policies that may require cancellation  notice anywhere from 24 hours to seven days to avoid a charge for the room.  Also, it is advisable to cancel directly with the hotel rather than a national  800 number. Get a cancellation confirmation number.  </P> <P> Q: With costs high in Europe, where's the best place to change dollars into  local currency?  </P> <P> A: Change most of your dollars in Europe, but remember that hotels generally  give less favorable rates than banks. Traveler's checks can bring a better rate  because less paperwork is involved. Also check local currency brokers who often  are competitive.  </P> <P> Q: When is the Mozart Festival in New York City and what's taking place?  </P> <P>  A: Some 500 events are scheduled at the city's Lincoln Center, from Jan. 27,  1991, to Aug. 29, 1992, from opera to films to chamber music. During the  festival, the complete works of Mozart will be performed.  </P> <P> Q: We're traveling to Western Europe. Is a health insurance policy advisable?  </P> <P> A: If your current policy doesn't cover accidents or illness abroad, such  protection is always advisable. Emergency medical treatment or air evacuation  can be costly. Consult your insurance broker or travel agent.  </P> <P> Q: Are Soviet cruise ships still banned from American ports? If not, is there a  likelihood of their resuming soon?  </P> <P> A: The Soviets are interested in entering the cruise trade in the United States  in the near future and are discussing deals that will add several new vessels  to their fleet.  </P></p>

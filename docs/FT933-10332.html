			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Waters easier Water issues weakened, dragging down some regional electricity companies with them, as at least two brokers decided that the sector looked overvalued. BZW struck a cautious note in its latest piece of research, advising clients to move 'underweight' in the water sector, as it highlighted potential regulatory dangers likely to be thrown up when Ofwat makes its next report in the autumn. BZW suggests that should the regulator adopt a similar view on capital values to those taken by other regulatory bodies then the water stocks will look expensive. With their recent post-ERM gains, BZW believes they could be around 13 per cent overvalued at current values. Ms Angela Whelan, utilities analyst at BZW, said: 'This represents an excellent opportunity to sell into strength and realise profits.' NatWest Securities was also underlining regulatory worries in retaining its 'neutral' stance, suggesting that this month's Ofgas report on British Gas will have direct implications for how Ofwat decides to act on its sector. The broker also said that the sector was looking overbought at its morning meeting. Among those stocks hit, Anglian slipped 5 to 497p, Southern 6 to 525p and Welsh 4 to 584p.</p>

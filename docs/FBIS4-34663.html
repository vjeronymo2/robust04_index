			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Minister of Tourism Osmany Cienfuegos by </F> Felix Fernando Garrido on the "Exclusive" program -- recorded]    [Text] [Garrido] On the first day of the fourth  Ibero-American Symposium on Tourism, Politburo member Osmany  Cienfuegos, Cuban Minister of Tourism, made the following  comments for this newscast:    [Begin recording] [Cienfuegos] First of all, I believe this  is an important effort. This helps to establish a closer  relation among our peoples and I believe that the effort to hold  the symposium in the municipality where tourism is actually  carried out is an important thing. In this, we have a lot to  learn and we have already begun. We believe that an event such  as this helps us and our comrades to understand the importance  of the development of municipal tourism so we can learn from the  things done in these countries.    [Garrido] This is the fourth symposium. What do you think  have been the main results of the past three and what are the  expectations for this meeting?    [Cienfuegos] The main achievement is making sure this type  of  event continues to be held. I believe that is the most important  thing. We must make sure the symposium is permanent.    [Garrido] Are there expectations on the self-sufficiency of  the tourism activities at the base level? Undoubtedly, this also  has another purpose. What is your opinion on this?    [Cienfuegos] If we do not achieve self-sufficiency at the  base level, then it is not a base activity.    [Garrido] We have heard that the goal is 1 million tourists  for 1995.    [Cienfuegos] There has been talk about 1 million tourists in  1995 and of 1 billion [currency not specified] in income. The  goal of 1 million tourists in 1995 will not be met. We will  reach the goal of 1 billion, however, which is probably the most  important thing. We will reach 1 billion in 1995.    [Garrido] Where would you place tourism regarding its  importance in the Cuban economy?    [Cienfuegos] Tourism is one of the main sources of income.  That has been said before. Comrade Fidel himself said, during  the meeting in Varadero, that tourism is destined to be the main  source of income for Cuba. This year, it is likely to be the  main source of income as a consequence of the small sugar  harvest we had.    [Garrido] Thank you very much. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Sergey Bychkov] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 16 TASS -- Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo  Van Kiet remains optimistic about prospects of signing a  bilateral treaty with Russia. "Talks with the Russian side are  going on productively. The new interstate treaty has been in  general agreed upon which is very important", he told TASS on  Thursday and added that the document would be signed after  certain improvements.    The treaty was scheduled to be signed today. However, the  delegations failed to eliminate various disagreements, TASS  learned from sources close to the Russian Government.    Sources from the Vietnamese delegation explained to TASS  that  the disputed issues include prospecting and production of oil  and natural gas by the joint "Vietsovpetro" venture, the  problems of the Vietnamese community in Russia, as well as the  Russian naval base in Cam Ranh. Vietnam wants to revise its  leasing terms. Besides, agreement is yet to be reached on the  role of the United Nations in the world and the Vietnamese debt  to Russia.</p>

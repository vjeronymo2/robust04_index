			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Vimto sparkles with 12% rise but Bensons dives into the red BRITONS consumed a record 9.6m litres of Vimto, the favourite elixir of Northern non-drinkers, helping JN Nichols, its manufacturer, report a 12 per cent rise to Pounds 3.53m in pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30. The fruit and herb drink, invented in 1909 as a healthy alternative to the evils of alcohol, was the main impetus to a 4 per cent increase in sales to Pounds 23.6m. Mr Simon Nichols, finance director and ardent Vimto fan, said warm weather and better exposure in outlets throughout Britain had boosted profits in the UK. He gave no credit for Vimto's growing popularity to the fad for healthy drinks. 'It has not got enough of anything that is brilliant for you,' he said. In Saudi Arabia, where Vimto and a date is the traditional way to break the Ramadan fast, sales were slightly lower. Overall, export sales fell by Pounds 1m to Pounds 1.75m. Earnings per share rose from 13.2p to 14.8p. The interim dividend is raised from 4.6p to 5.1p. In contrast, Bensons Crisps suffered adversely from a surge in demand for multi-pack products. The USM-quoted snack food group fell into the red with losses of Pounds 191,000 pre-tax for the half-year to May 30, against profits of Pounds 312,000 last time. Mr Malcolm Jones, chairman, said trading conditions throughout the period had been as 'difficult as any I have ever experienced in my 14 years in the snacks industry'. He said consumers were increasingly buying multi-packs of crisps from supermarkets, rather than independent retailers. About 60 per cent of Bensons' manufacturing output is sold to independents. First-half turnover improved to Pounds 15.6m (Pounds 11.5m) Interest charges rose by Pounds 110,000 to Pounds 143,000. Losses per share emerged at 1.7p (earnings 2.8p) but the interim dividend is maintained at 0.7p.</p>

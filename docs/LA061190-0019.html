			<p><P> June 11, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOM AS METAPHOR;  </P> <P> WOMEN: NOT ALL ARE BORN NURTURERS, BUT THAT DOESN'T PRECLUDE THEIR HAVING A  HAPPY FAMILY LIFE.  </P> <P> "At the end of your life, you will never regret not having passed one more  test, not winning one more verdict or not closing one more deal," Barbara Bush  advised the Wellesley graduates. "You will regret time not spent with a  husband, a child, a friend or a parent."  </P> <P> It would be lovely if all women's lives were that clearly defined, but they are  not. There are, for better or for worse, different kinds of women, just as  there are different types of men. Progress for women in the '90s will require a  more subtle look at the problems that continue to weaken and dishearten working  mothers in the real world.  </P> <P> There are indeed some women who are able to put a finger on their clear  internal priorities, as Mrs. Bush suggests; they realize that they are truly  happiest when they are nurturing their families. They feel relatively  unambivalent about being home full-time, working very hard to take care of  family life, often facilitating a very demanding career for a husband.  </P> <P> It is convenient for everyone when this is the case; the woman has her dreams  and aspirations fulfilled, the man has love and support for a career that  usually well needs it, and the children grow up with a life in which their  needs represent the raison d'etre of someone else's life. Fulfillment of these  women's passions and attending to their family's daily needs are fortuitously  synonymous.  </P> <P> In reality, however, many women cannot say that about themselves. While they do  derive profound pleasure from their family and marital life, they also take  great satisfaction and a sense of esteem from the work they do outside the  home. Their talents and temperaments are such that their being home full-time  to nurture is not the best thing for anyone.  </P> <P> Our history is replete with examples of great writers, business executives,  litigators, scientists and the like whose passions took them away from family  life for periods of time. Had they forgone an expression of these talents, at  the end of their lives there would indeed have been regrets.  </P> <P> It has been difficult for our society to face this dichotomized female identity  for several reasons. First is the collective American fantasy that posts "real"  women at home every day, waiting for the children as they arrive from school,  lending an immediate ear, offering yummy snacks and otherwise attending to  them.  </P> <P> This fantasy demonstrates the difference between wishes and needs. While we may  all wish for the metaphorical Mom who will satisfy our every need promptly,  what we actually need in a mother is a woman who knows herself, listens to her  own internal cues and strikes a balance that will accommodate both her needs  and those of her family. It has been tough for us to admit that for women to  realize their potential, often other members of the family, society and outside  help may be necessary to aid family life.  </P> <P> It has been all too convenient for our society to hold women to the family  identity alone. In the many years that women were literally disallowed from  practicing professions and denied admission to institutions, society was  allowed to avoid its own responsibility to provide support for such necessary  programs as maternity leave and flexible work hours.  </P> <P> In current American society, basic protections to aid family life are still not  provided. It is Barbara Bush's husband himself who purportedly plans to veto  the Family and Medical Leave Act, should he be given the chance. First it must  get through Congress, of which 96% of the members are men who, no doubt, have  relied on "nurturers" for maintaining family life. This is the persistent  double standard with which we live.  </P> <P> There is yet another group of women in the real world, those for whom  entanglements with children are not a primary priority. They choose not to be  parents, but to make contributions in other ways. This should be neither  unimaginable nor the object of needless and wasteful value judgments. The  fantasy that all women are created to have the ultimate and complete joy solely  in family life is just that: a fantasy. Women, their families and society all  stand to gain from a more complete view of women.  </P></p>

Chief Designer of Reactors,  Vasiliy Stekolnikov, on the past, present, and future of  Russia's nuclear power plants.    Vasiliy Vasilyevich granted only one interview in his  life and that was in America. When he arrived, the chief  designer, naturally, was at the center of the attention not only  of his colleagues but also of newspapermen. One of them managed  to "get Stekolnikov talking." The interview was published the  next day and, much to Stekolnikov's surprise, he read in it  things he had not said! That is when he made a pledge: "No  interviews!" And since Vasiliy Vasilyevich is an acerbic person  and does not mince words, he added a couple of "strong  expressions" and since that time has had no contact with  journalists.    Our relations with him were different. We have visited  the nuclear power plants several times and attended various  conferences together and we have discussed the vicissitudes of  life over a glass of vodka. But I never once asked him for an  interview, and ultimately Stekolnikov could not help asking:  "Why not?" I admitted honestly: I do not want to spoil our good  relationship. He hemmed and hawed a while and never returned to  the "problem of the interview."    But this was the anniversary of Atomenergoremont--an  organization that does perhaps the most difficult and dangerous  work at nuclear power plants. So it turned out that we spent a  good deal of time together. And ultimately Vasiliy Vasilyevich  "waxed generous": He agreed to speak frankly about the problems  related to nuclear energy engineering and his work in it.    [Gubarev] Vasiliy Vasilyevich, who are you?    [Stekolnikov] An interesting question...but I myself do not  know: perhaps a Russian, perhaps Veps...those who were not  conquered by Genghis Khan. My ancestors are from around Pskov,  areas that have always been considered "Russian land from time  immemorial"; that is where our village is. I was unable to go  there for a long time--I did not have the time, and then when I  managed to get to these parts--there are most beautiful  landscapes...but that does not interest you and so I will give  you a straightforward answer: Since 1962 I have been the chief  designer of Gidropress and director at the same time. Over 25  years we have created it with our own hands and that is why the  firm now looks extremely representative--there are only 48,000  square meters of production area, 19 buildings with 100  apartments each, two kindergartens...We did some real work!    [Gubarev] A strange name, Gidropress....    [Stekolnikov] It is arbitrary...or rather--secret. Which we  have been since 1946 when we began to work on reactors. Speaking  of the "bare essentials," not including trifles, it is a number  of research reactors, the first steam generator in the world, we  make steam generators for Siberian combines--in Krasnoyarsk and  Tomsk, and then VVER's [water-moderated power reactors],  particularly 35 "440's," 19 "millions," and modifications of  reactors for submarines. The Americans called them "alpha," and  a turmoil even began in their Congress at that time: Why have  the Russians gotten ahead of us? Incidentally, for these  reactors I was awarded the title Hero of Socialist Labor.    [Gubarev] It is strange that for military reactors you are  designated a Hero, but not for VVER's.    [Stekolnikov] I was a prize winner...Gidropress was the  first  circuit, that is, a "nuclear island." We are in charge here. In  general we work where there is radioactivity, and we are not  interested in places where there is none...other people are in  charge there.    [Gubarev] Vasiliy Vasilyevich, how did you become chief  designer? Did you start from "scratch"....    [Stekolnikov] I graduated from the tekhnikum in Kaliningrad.  I had always been interested in diesel engines and steam  engines. But I went into power machine building, to the boiler  department for another reason: the stipend there was larger and  by that time I was alone--both my mother and father were dead.  So in terms of my higher education I am a boiler worker. I was a  fairly good student and almost graduated with distinction.    After the institute we were sent to Nefteapparatur. We were  not asked--at that time they needed fuel for jet aircraft. That  was in Podolsk. We began to draw up blueprints. And my friends  became section chiefs, things turned out very well! We received  excellent training...and the first thing they said was: "Forget  about what you have learned before! You have a head on your  shoulders--so use it!" In the section we graduated from two  universities--no, I am exaggerating!    In November 1954 after two months of testing I was  transferred to Gidropress although, true, at that time it had no  name--it was simply an enterprise with a number...and I was  immediately assigned as a senior engineer. My wages were  high--180 rubles. For some reason I began to rise rapidly--soon  I was a section chief.    [Gubarev] And what was your first job working with the  "nuclear subject"?    [Stekolnikov] Cooling channels on submarines. If I came up  with something new I was immediately given a prize. Although, to  be honest, I was not very interested in this subject  matter...but at that time there was the concept of "necessity"  and therefore we did everything that was required of us, the  more so since I was the chief of the water reactor section and  the other guys were in charge of ship installations...but  nonetheless they put me on the ships, and the curious thing is  that it worked out! At that time I invented a compact apparatus  which I think is still used to this day...it would be nice to  know this....    And in general my first design was a column 28 meters high  weighing about 800 tonnes. It was for petroleum processing. It  took perseverance to calculate it, the stiffening ring, etc. I  calculated everything according to the formulas and then I  looked and saw that something was wrong. I added something of my  own. And I turned out to be right! No, it was not a matter of  playing it safe, it was engineering intuition. In our business  you cannot get by without that.    In those days we acted like hooligans. We made a pipe for an  oil refinery that was 40 meters high. We came up with a new  "reamer" for it--we saved a great deal of metal. And do you know  why we did all this? We were not paid very much and from  efficiency proposals we [passage illegible] very useful in real  design work--we had no stereotypes in our heads, we were always  trying to think of something new. As it were, this was training  for real work.    [Gubarev] And this time came?    [Stekolnikov] Of course. The atomic submarine. Seventeen  years of my life. Imagine how many chiefs have come and gone?!  And difficulties? First vibration, then excessive weight...but  still we managed! In the Kremlin at a meeting of the  military-industrial commission when I was asked: "Well, how is  the ship?" I answered: "It will be done! I believe we will end  up with a first-class submarine." We achieved it through sweat  and blood... But when we lowered it, we wept. Not just me--many  people...perhaps from happiness, perhaps from what we had been  through, but we wept...snow was falling, it was night--that was  so the enemies could not locate us!--and we lowered the ship  into the water and wept because we had devoted some 17 years to  it.    I have never told anyone about that before--even my wife,  but  I am telling you so that you will understand how difficult it is  to get the star of a Hero. It is only fools who can say that  they give out these stars left and right. Perhaps some people  have received them without justification, but we designers and  scientists have earned each one of them with many years of sweat  and blood, coronaries and pain, sleepless nights and everything  we have missed out on in life in order to do what was necessary  for the country and the people.    [Gubarev] But why was it so difficult for you to make this  ship?    [Stekolnikov] There was a great deal of competition.  Dollezhal was working, as were other chief designers. But they  were already academicians, Heros, and enjoyed a great deal of  authority. People listened to their opinion, and then here was  this Stekolnikov...we had to prove that we had come up with  something better.    [Gubarev] Was this something principally new?    [Stekolnikov] Of course. Water is one thing, but we had  something altogether new. This had to do with the compactness of  the installation, the absence of noise, and a great deal of  power. A completely different kind of reactor. But the ship was  "clean"--it could be received in any port.    [Gubarev] Were there any accidents?    [Stekolnikov] Well, how do you avoid them! But if there was  an accident one day, the next day I crawled in there myself: I  wanted to know what happened. But that was possible only in our  own reactor; you could not get inside anybody else's reactor,  those of the competitors. We had "alpha" activity; you cover it  up with a newspaper and it is safe. There was no gamma radiation.    [Gubarev] And you were working on civilian reactors more or  less "as a sideline?"    [Stekolnikov] To my "personal account" I credit the boiling  reactor, BOR-60; done entirely by our department. It ended up a  compact reactor... submarine [reactor]--order [figure illegible]  ... steam generators for Shevchenko and heat exchangers as  well... VVER-440, VVER-1000, and some other things. And I am  proud of all this; after all, it was not in vain that I spent 40  years in the nuclear industry.    [Gubarev] [passage illegible], for example, from the  automobile?    [Stekolnikov] Actually nowhere. Physicists and mechanics  have  the same law. The only peculiarity is the nuclear part--residual  heat release, that is, after the reactor is shut down it  continues to release a great deal of heat. If an ordinary  furnace is shut down it becomes cold within an hour or two, but  a reactor will remain "warm" for another hundred years. The  residual quantity of energy is extremely great and it must be  controlled.    [Gubarev] I thought you would talk about radiation.    [Stekolnikov] Of course the danger of radiation exists. This  is a reality that must be dealt with and necessarily taken into  account. But, I repeat, there are laws of physics, and this  means that we must not fear them but take them into account.  That is why science exists. And we must create reliable designs.    Unfortunately, I have now come to the conclusion that we  cannot see the degradation of material in time. There is no such  science. I would call this branch the "life of materials." Why  does graphite function for only 40 years? It will not work any  longer than that...in general, materials, like man, get old and  go out of commission. We live for 70 years, but we will never  get to 200. Why? There is no answer to this question yet--either  for man or for material.    [Gubarev] You have apparently forgotten about Chernobyl. Is  this not the main thing in atomic engineering?    [Stekolnikov] I am not to blame for Chernobyl...of course  one  must look into the causes and effects of the catastrophe, but  not in the way your fellow journalist sometimes does. Why write  about a goat with two heads if it was born before Chernobyl?! Or  about the fact that he, the journalist, is prepared to watch  television--and this was printed!--in candlelight?! A great  tragedy occurred in Chernobyl, very great, but we must not  capitalize on tragedy, we must not!    [Gubarev] Those are the consequences...but nonetheless the  accident occurred, did it not?    [Stekolnikov] That is hooliganism...the same thing as riding  in a car without brakes. You may make it home once, but the next  time you will definitely get into an accident. Unfortunately,  nuclear energy workers frequently drove without brakes, hoping  that everything would turn out all right....    It is clear to me that the people in charge of the reactor  in  Chernobyl were at fault. There should be no argument here. But  the reactor itself, of course, had great shortcomings. It  accelerated; that is, when the safety rods were released,  instead of shutting down the reactor began to pick up speed. The  designers and scientists are to blame for this. And this too  must be admitted...but still the main thing is that they should  not have been careless with the reactor. It is dynamite.    [Gubarev] Is the same thing possible with yours?    [Stekolnikov] No.    [Gubarev] Vasiliy Vasilyevich, what will become of nuclear  engineering in 50 years, what do you think?    [Stekolnikov] I think that the "fast reactors" that produce  their own fuel will occupy their proper position in energy  engineering. But I have doubts about thermonuclear installations  where it is possible to obtain a large amount of energy as well.  There are problems with materials there and not everything  works. A great deal has been done in nuclear energy; the  necessary base has been created--from prospecting for uranium to  various kinds of installations. This is mainly to the credit of  Yefim Pavlovich Slavskiy, who for many years was in charge of  our nuclear industry and was able to think about the future.    [Gubarev] Is the nuclear infrastructure being destroyed now?    [Stekolnikov] A very stupid thing is being done. We are not  living and working efficiently...of course the question of  questions in nuclear energy engineering is safety. You are not  afraid when you drive in a car or travel on a ship even though  you may get into an accident and die. And yet the probability of  having a collision or sinking is much greater than suffering  from nuclear energy. People must understand this and then make  their choice.    [Gubarev] How do you assess the present state of nuclear  energy? I have in mind its division--into Russian, Ukrainian,  Lithuanian, etc.?    [Stekolnikov] Pardon me for being so blunt, but it is a  crime! What we are doing with nuclear energy today is a crime  against people, against ourselves. What are we afraid of? It is  thought that genetic mutations will occur under the influence of  radiation, that is, mankind will begin to degenerate. Are there  data or precise conclusions for this? No. So why are we so ready  to work with them and use questionable theories? Large doses of  radiation--that is understandable. Six hundred roentgens--and  you are no more...but small doses, I am convinced, cause no  harm. The entire history of mankind--since ancient times!--has  proceeded with stronger radiation than the norms we establish  for nuclear power plants. So we should be speaking about  psychology and not about the real impact of radiation.    [Gubarev] I asked about the condition of the nuclear power  plants in Russia and Ukraine.    [Stekolnikov] We have become accustomed to babbling about  safety: they say it begins with the mining of ore and ends with  the burial of the waste, and the nuclear power plant is  somewhere in between. So we talk a lot about safety but we deal  with it only when forced to; we do nothing without orders and  directives from the higher leadership...let me give this  example. In Germany in Nord we worked with an active zone. We  had to look at 30 cassettes showing what was going on there. We  took six or seven of them. I looked at them and it became clear  to me. I said: We do not need any more...but the German was  persistent: no, we will continue to work until I get all of the  cassettes--those were his instructions... Essentially he was  right, but I threw up my hands and left. It turns out that  people perceive one and the same thing in different ways. We  Russians still probably need the "stick," but we are beginning  to "dodge," shameful as it is to admit it....    [Gubarev] As a chief designer have you frequently had to use  the "club"?    [Stekolnikov] It has happened...I have driven my close  comrade to tears a couple of times. I tell him to do this or  that. And he responds: That is not my job, it is the job of  another department chief. I insist, and he agrees. Then I  explain to him that I cannot--and we are friends!--work with a  person who does not obey my orders, and therefore I dismiss him  from his duties.    [Gubarev] And did you fire him?    [Stekolnikov] Of course...and he is a respected person, a  prizewinner...well everyone protected him and defended him. Then  he came to me and started crying. I withdrew the order.    [Gubarev] And does your conscience still bother you?    [Stekolnikov] I no longer have one. But discipline is  necessary in our business, and responsibility as well. And that  is why the orders of the chief designer have to be carried out.  Unfortunately, we, that is, the chief designers, have to make  "intellectual" decisions that are sometimes unusual. And they  must be implemented, even though frequently many people do not  agree with them. Therefore, we must be "strict"; otherwise,  nothing will work.    [Gubarev] Where are your reactors in operation now?    [Stekolnikov] Let us try to list them. We will begin with  Bulgaria--there are six blocks there. Hungary--four blocks.  Czechoslovakia--four. Four blocks have been in operation in  Germany and a fifth was started but now they have been removed.  In Finland--two blocks. We now have in Kola--four,  Voronezh--two, Rovno--two, well and there are others...quite  unfortunately, the construction of new blocks has been  postponed, and these are the reactors that are the most perfect.  We have taken into account all mistakes from the past, created  reliable machines, but these are the ones that the public  attacked. I think a great mistake is being made. Oh, how we will  regret this mistake in the near future!    [Gubarev] Are you familiar with foreign reactors?    [Stekolnikov] Of course. I have seen them in Italy, France,  Belgium, Japan, Germany, and the United States. And I have  crawled into all of them, felt them with my own hands, and  inspected each unit down to the details--I always wonder whether  they have thought of something better than ours. The designer  has a terrible enemy--vibration. In Hungary I even talked the  leaders into letting me go down under the reactor--I had to feel  precisely how the vibration was occurring in the pipelines. They  objected for a long time but I finally persuaded them--I crawled  down there and felt it. There was one problem with it....    [Gubarev] Can you compare them and us?    [Stekolnikov] We began to design reactors literally "from  scratch." At least I did. About four people knew what had to be  done--Kurchatov and his closest colleagues. As scientists they  had calculated everything and we were supposed to make the  concrete designs. With time came experience and a deeper  understanding of the processes that take place in a reactor.    Today it seems to me that our scientists and designers are  just as good as the Western ones, who have travelled the same  path as we have. In some things they have achieved successes and  outpaced us, but there are many areas where they have something  to learn from us. So I cannot and will not bow to the West. We  will cooperate with them on an equal basis; everyone stands to  gain from this. And if someone wants to prove that they are  "better" or we are--these people have no notion of science or  technology. Most frequently this is the way politicians think.  And bad ones at that....    I know for sure that in the history of the development of  nuclear energy over the decades we have not fallen behind anyone  at any time. And we have the right to be proud.</p>

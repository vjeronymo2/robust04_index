			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: So you can't work . . . - The benefits of permanent health insurance Parliament this week gave a second reading to a bill which could mean 200,000 people stop being eligible for invalidity benefits after April 1995 and new claimants get considerably less than they would now. The number of people claiming invalidity benefit has soared, so the government is trying to curb costs. The bill going through parliament replaces statutory sick pay and invalidity benefit with a single Incapacity Benefit, which increases depending on the length of time a person is out of action. The key change is not in timing or levels of benefit, however, but the definition of incapacity to work. The usual interpretation of present regulations is that claimants must be incapable of doing their normal jobs or any 'reasonable' job - one for which their experience or qualifications are suited. A skilled manual worker unable to do his own job might be capable physically of light office work. Under present rules, he would get benefit if he was not qualified to do this. In future, this definition will be replaced after 28 weeks with one based on an objective medical test of physical and mental capacity for any kind of work at all, so excluding many present claimants. The National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux reports that the stricter criteria are being applied in some areas already. 'Bureaux all over the country report an alarming increase in benefit withdrawals, demonstrating that a narrower definition of incapacity is already being used,' it says. 'Many CAB clients are told that they should seek work completely unrelated to their skills, disability or previous experience.' The association says people have been told to find jobs as artists' models, embalmers or bingo callers. People found ineligible for invalidity benefit may then claim unemployment benefit or income support. But the latter is means-tested and no one with assets over Pounds 8,000 is eligible. So, anyone with savings over this level has to use them up before qualifying. Insurance companies and friendly societies have for many years offered a private sector version of sick pay, usually known as permanent health insurance. A monthly premium buys cover for up to 75 per cent of your salary if you cannot work through ill-health. But Martin Werth of Munich Re, a reinsurance company, says that only 10 to 12 per cent of the UK population has PHI cover. Insurers have, like the government, been faced with unsustainable claim rates and some have responded by tightening definitions as well. They tend to use two definitions of incapacity. The traditional, more generous version is the 'own occupation' definition, paying out if you cannot perform your usual job. The other is inability to carry on your own occupation or any occupation to which you are suited by education and experience. Some insurers switch to this wider definition after two years of a claim. Others use it from the start, particularly for certain occupations such as airline pilots where a very minor health problem can mean the permanent end of a flying career. No insurer at present requires claimants to be incapable of any work whatsoever, the direction in which the government is moving. The insurance ombudsman stamped this out by interpreting 'any job' as meaning 'any reasonable job,' thereby excluding unsuitable work. The private sector sees it as inevitable that the changes in the state system will increase demand for PHI. But Werth says the implications will take a while to sink in. 'The present level of state benefits is very low and would give a standard of living equal only to an unskilled worker, living on a council estate, with no car and no margin for luxuries,' he says. After April 1995, when the earnings-related element (now worth a maximum of about Pounds 59 a week) is eliminated, the safety net will provide an even more spartan life style. 'Not much will happen before April 1995, and then the horror stories will start coming through,' Werth predicts. He thinks 20 or 25 per cent of the population could have PHI cover by the year 2000. Unfortunately, PHI is expensive. Premiums depend on your age, sex, health, occupation, salary, and the length of time you are prepared to wait after falling ill before payments begin. Premiums to buy cover of about Pounds 2,000 a month for a white-collar worker can cost more than Pounds 50 a month. Bob Farrington, chief executive of the Ideal Benefit Society, a friendly society, says contracts will have to become cheaper and more flexible. Friendly society sick pay is usually based on the 'Holloway contract,' which starts paying immediately and also has a savings element to provide a small pension. Ideal Benefit has adapted this to offer waiting periods of seven days to two years. Werth thinks there could be a market for a low-cost PHI product which uses medical/functional rather than occupational definitions. Although the definition of incapacity would then be as strict as the state, levels of benefit could be higher.</p>

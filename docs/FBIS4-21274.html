De Greiff called several U.S. officials liars and accused  President Gaviria of unnecessarily criticizing him for his fight  against drug traffickers. De Greiff said the president wanted  to calm the U.S. Government's temper by attacking him. The  prosecutor general said of the Colombian Government: They  wanted to make themselves seem subservient to the U.S.  Government by attacking me.    As for the accusations that Colombia is a narcodemocracy, de  Greiff said it is an exaggerated perception and once again  called Senator Kerry and Assistant Attorney General Harris liars.</p>

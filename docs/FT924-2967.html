			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Goya bullfight reaches record Pounds 4.95m: Saleroom A SCENE at a bullfight, painted by Goya when he was 78, sold for Pounds 4.95m at Sotheby's in London yesterday to the Getty Museum of Malibu, California. The price, an auction record for Goya, was within the saleroom's estimate. Goya painted the scene from memory in 1824 while an exile in Paris for his friend Joaquin Ferrer and it has remained in the Ferrer family. Important paintings by Goya rarely appear on the market, and that accounts for the price. The auction of Old Master pictures totalled Pounds 9.4m and was 27.6 per cent unsold by value. But bidding was selective and 39 of the 85 lots in the morning session were bought in, including works by Murillo and Cranach the Elder and a portrait attributed to Durer. The main casualty was a Venetian scene by Canaletto for which bidding stopped at Pounds 650,000, well below the high estimate of Pounds 1.5m. A view of Amsterdam painted by Philips de Koninck in the 1640s went to a German dealer for Pounds 990,000, a record for the artist but below its forecast. It was sold by the trustees of the estate of the late Earl Mountbatten. Another artist record was the Pounds 335,000 paid for a scene at a Venetian masked ball painted by Giovanni Antonio Guardi, brother of the more famous Francesco Guardi. 'A Hawking Party on a Hilly Landscape' by Philips Wouwermans, estimated at up to Pounds 70,000, sold for Pounds 253,000, and 'Three Figures at a Table' by a follower of Caravaggio made Pounds 115,500 against a Pounds 30,000 top estimate. One of the most important antiquities to appear at Christie's for many years, a red painted limestone statue of per-Neb, a temple inspector of 5th Dynasty Egypt (2360 BC), was unsold yesterday even though its estimate of Pounds 600,000 to Pounds 800,000 was reduced substantially before the auction.</p>

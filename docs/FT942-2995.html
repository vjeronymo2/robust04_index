			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / World Commodities Prices: Coffee futures recover early losses - Market Report London Commodity Exchange COFFEE futures recovered from an early reaction against recent strong gains to finish the day only marginally lower. Traders saw the morning's Dollars 56 fall to Dollars 2,340 a tonne for September delivery as a correction in a continuing bull run. The price closed at Dollars 2,388, down Dollars 8 on balance. Coffee's later strength helped COCOA, although it had not emulated the initial fall. At the LME ALUMINIUM prices belatedly followed COPPER'S retreat. Compiled from Reuters</p>

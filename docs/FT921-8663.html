			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / International Company News: Krupp clears last obstacle to its takeover of Hoesch THE last significant obstacle to Krupp's takeover of Hoesch, and the creation of a DM30bn (Dollars 18.8bn) German steel and engineering combine, was cleared yesterday. The supervisory board of Hoesch instructed the group's management to press on with merger negotiations after hearing that the link-up would offer cost savings of about DM1.5bn over the next five years. More than two-thirds of the economies would be made in the steel sector, although no plant would be closed, Hoesch executives told the board, which includes representatives from unions, shareholders and regional politicians. Job losses, in addition to those already planned by the two companies, would be limited to 1,800 from a combined workforce of about 110,000. From 1996 onwards, the new group could expect a 'positive contribution to results' of DM460m a year, Hoesch said. The merger is expected to be approved at the Hoesch annual meeting on June 22, and back-dated to take effect from January 1. Krupp refused to comment on reports that it would pay for the outstanding 49 per cent of Hoesch through a share swap arrangement. But it is understood that Krupp, which is privately controlled (only the Krupp Stahl steel subsidiary is quoted), plans a flotation and to offer its new shares for Hoesch stock. There was concern in Germany yesterday that the relatively small job losses might overload the new group with high wage costs at a critical time. Steel, which accounted for DM12bn of combined sales in 1990, is suffering from the world market slump. The companies' engineering specialities, including plant and automotive components, are feeling the effects of falling international and domestic demand. However, the deal will give the new company critical mass in steel production, with output almost as high as that of Thyssen, the country's biggest producer, and synergies across a wide range of markets. The merger is likely to be followed by a series of co-operation deals with other companies. Krupp's two steel divisions, for example, are to be rolled into one. Hoesch yesterday responded to gloomy speculation about 1991 results with an announcement that profits would be 'well over' DM200m, without specifying whether they were before or after taxes. Operating profits in 1990 were DM440m. Claiming to be satisfied with the outcome, the company said all sectors had shown improved results in the last quarter of the year. Even steel was expected to break even.</p>

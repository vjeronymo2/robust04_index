			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Northern Telecom shares fall 20% NORTHERN Telecom's shares lost about a fifth of their value on the New York and Toronto stock exchanges yesterday after the surprise announcement that the Canadian telephone equipment maker expects to post a second-quarter loss. The shares of Northern's parent company, BCE of Montreal, were also hit. The announcement, made after North American markets closed on Friday, included a prediction of 'significantly' lower earnings for 1993. Northern's share price fell CDollars 10.25 to close at CDollars 37.13 in Toronto. BCE, which owns 53 per cent of Northern, fell CDollars 1.50 to close at CDollars 44. Northern said that it had been hit by lower-than-expected sales of public switches in Europe and North America, and a squeeze on margins. The computerised switches are among its most profitable products. Analysts said yesterday that Northern appeared to be the victim of changing spending patterns among North America's regional telephone companies. Although overall capital spending had remained roughly unchanged, the emphasis had shifted from switching equipment - Northern's strength - to transmission products and cellular technology, where its exposure was relatively small. 'Their product mix isn't quite right,' said Mr George Podrasky, analyst at Duff &amp; Phelps in Chicago. Northern also announced the replacement of its chairman, Dr Paul Stern, by Mr Bradford Butler, a former chairman of Procter &amp; Gamble, and a long-serving Northern director. Dr Stern, who stepped aside as chief executive earlier this year, has been given credit for expanding Northern's international business, but criticised for neglecting customer service, especially of the regional phone companies. Analysts yesterday cut their 1993 earnings estimates to between USDollars 1 and Dollars 1.50 a share, from the Dollars 2.20 per share previously expected. Earnings in 1992 were Dollars 2.17 a share. Northern's second-quarter earnings last year were USDollars 72.3m (Pounds 48.5m).</p>

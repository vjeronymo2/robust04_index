			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / World Trade News: US cigarette law attacked as illegal NEW US legislation requiring cigarette manufacturers to use no more than 25 per cent imported tobacco was yesterday strongly attacked by tobacco exporting nations in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. They claim that the provision, signed into law in August as part of the US Budget Reconciliation Act, violates Gatt rules forbidding countries to stipulate the local content of domestic production and will have a severe impact on tobacco exports to the American market. The complaint was brought to yesterday's meeting of Gatt's governing council by Brazil on behalf of Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Thailand, Venezuela and Zimbabwe, and was supported by Chile, Argentina and Canada. The EC, the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean) and Australia also expressed concern. The US said it would hold formal consultations with its critics next week. This marks the first step in Gatt's formal disputes procedure, which could eventually lead to the establishment of an independent panel inquiry. The law was inspired by Senator Wendell Ford, a Democrat who represents the tobacco growing state of Kentucky, as part of the horse-trading which allowed President Bill Clinton's budget plan to squeak through Congress. Earlier yesterday the Gatt council agreed to set up a disputes panel to examine Chile's complaint over the EC's licensing and surveillance system for imported apples.</p>

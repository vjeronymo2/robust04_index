			<p>BFN     [Text] United Nations Undersecretary General Ismat Kittani  has stressed UN concern about Mozambique's troubled peace  process during a week-long visit. During his visit, which ended  today, Mr. Kittani urged more speed in the process leading to  elections scheduled for October. Military demobilization is  running well behind schedule. The UN Security Council deadline  for the elections is October and the deadline for the  peace-keeping mission November. Mr. Kittani met President  Joaquim Chissano and Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance]  leader Afonso Dhlakama and will report back to the Security  Council on the country's progress toward peace. Renamo peace  negotiator Raul Domingos said Mr. Kittani's visit had shown the  UN secretary general's concern to see the peace process end well.</p>

By the end of last year these enterprises, involved in the  fields of industry, commerce, public utilities and real estate,  had combined capital totalling 22.3 billion yuan. Twenty-nine  of them have been approved to issue B-shares and H-shares.    A survey shows that they have raised a sum of more than 30  billion yuan by issuing stocks.    Last year, 31 of them each generated 40 percent more profits  than in the previous year. The economic index of the rate of  output value, and profits and taxes, and the net increase of  fixed assets was higher than the average level for Shanghai's  industries.    At present, these enterprises have separated their property  ownership from management, and shifted their operational  mechanisms toward the market economy.    One example is the Shanghai Petrochemical Company Ltd, which  has 6.2 billion yuan in capital.    Aiming at establishing the modern enterprise system, the  company has cut its organizations from 55 to 19 and reduced its  employees from 1,270 to 420.    Meanwhile, it has employed an international standard  financial auditing system to reduce its production costs.    A municipal government official in charge of industry  disclosed that shanghai's enterprise reform this year will  concentrate on the establishment of a modern enterprise system,  including the formation of joint stock companies which will  float their shares.    At the same time, partnership companies have gained a rapid  development. By the end of last year, the number of such  enterprises had to 2,992, with capital totalling 1.46 billion  yuan.</p>

			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Berlusconi woos election ally in effort to form government Italian media magnate Mr Silvio Berlusconi intensified his efforts yesterday to persuade the populist Northern League to form part of the country's next government. The reservations of the League and its leader, Mr Umberto Bossi, are the main hurdle facing Mr Berlusconi in putting together a government after this week's landslide victory by the right-wing Freedom Alliance. Mr Berlusconi has already received broad backing from the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance. The MSI, together with Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia movement and the League, fought the elections under the banner of the Freedom Alliance, even though their electoral platforms were separate and often divergent. Yesterday, Mr Berlusconi held his second meeting in three days with League representatives. It was convened against the background of statements by Mr Bossi damping hopes of an agreement. Mr Bossi himself declined to attend and delegated his closest aide, Mr Roberto Maroni, to conduct the negotiations. Afterwards, Mr Berlusconi refused to be drawn on the talks and said he was operating to no precise timetable. However, he has let it be known that he is anxious to put together a government based round his four-month-old Forza Italia movement, the League and the MSI, headed by Mr Gianfranco Fini. Mr Maroni said: 'We will be able to put together a government and it will be a strong one.' His remarks confirmed the impression that the League is bargaining hard to ensure that if it enters government, the party does not become submerged by Mr Berlusconi and Forza Italia. In the election, Forza Italia took votes from the League in the north, but it helped the League nationally to gain 118 seats in the chamber by backing it during the campaign. The prospect of forming a government with a clear parliamentary majority - despite serious divisions in the Freedom Alliance - has prompted heavy buying of stocks on the Milan bourse this week and a strengthening of the lira against the D-mark. The lira was yesterday being traded at L960 against the D-mark compared with over L990 in the run-up to the elections. The lira has long been considered under-valued, and the market has been waiting to see the outcome of the elections. The currency has also firmed because of tentative signs that the recession has bottomed and a recovery, albeit timid, is on the way. The financial markets appeared to shrug off yesterday's events, and added to gains made on Thursday as traders predicted that a government could soon be formed. A Milan broker said: 'It is all part of the negotiating game. Of course, they are going to sell their support for the highest price they can.' Shares on the Milan stock exchange rose by 1.6 per cent yesterday, taking the BCI index to a close of 735.11.

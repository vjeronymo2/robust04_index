			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Resources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants are strongly encouraged to be exhaustive in examining available related resources and ongoing activities in order to maximize the potential impact of a microenterprise. The resources that the State will provide to meet the 100 percent matching requirement should be discussed in some detail providing a clear understanding of what is to be provided and what the relevance/linkage of these resources is to the activities proposed and to successfully meeting the primary goal of the project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Services and Techniques  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants shall specify the services and techniques they propose to provide to meet the goal of aiding economically disadvantaged individuals with microenterprises. Examples of key services and techniques that may be included in a proposal are: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Recruitment and screening. This is an important element both in identifying program staff to be trained as trainers and in identifying and selecting individuals who show potential for owning an microenterprise. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Case management. This would involve assigning an individual who provides guidance in all aspects of program participation and other services to microenterprise owners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Follow-up. Enrollment in and successful completion of a microenterprise training program may well be only the initial challenges facing the entrepreneur. A structured follow-up program involving such counseling and supportive services as deemed appropriate is a critical aspect of the program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Mentoring. This could involve assigning a volunteer businessperson from the community to serve in a one-on-one relationship with the new entrepreneur. Such volunteer service may not be considered for meeting the 100 percent matching requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Part IV_Evaluation Criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Prospective applicants are advised that the selection of grantees for award is to be made after careful evaluation of proposals by a panel of specialists within DOL.

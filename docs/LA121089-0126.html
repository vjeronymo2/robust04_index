Shortly before midnight on July 22, about 20  agents of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service and the state  Alcoholic and Beverage Control Bureau sealed the exits to Club Elegante,  searched and handcuffed some of the 150 patrons and demanded identification or  proof of citizenship from others.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE WEEK'S FILM PICKS BY TIMES CRITICS  </P> <P> A WORLD APART  </P> <P> A haunting, deeply moving film of conscience and consequence, this 1988 release  is really about two separated worlds, one huge, one intimately small: black  Africa and anti-apartheid activiit Diana Roth's all-female household. Told with  an empathy strengthened by director Chris Menges' refusal to sentimentalize his  characters, it's an autobiographical story by screenwriter Shawn Slovo, whose  mother became the first white woman to be jailed (in 1963) under South Africa's  90-day detention act. As Roth, Barbara Hershey brings her own warmth to a  sometimes difficult woman, who neglected her children in her intense political  commitments.  </P> <P> Sunday at 11 p.m. TMC Sheila Benson  </P></p>

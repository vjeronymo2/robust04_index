			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Whitehall 'could save Pounds 130m' on consultants The government could save Pounds 130m in three years if Whitehall departments adopted better methods of using external consultants, says a report published yesterday by the Cabinet Office Efficiency Unit. The report, an earlier version of which was leaked to the FT in April, says that departments use expensive consultants to do jobs that civil servants could do just as well. It says they commission consultants on 'rather too many projects' without inviting competitive bids, and duplicate work already done for other departments. The report makes 34 recommendations for getting better value for money out of consultants, including making greater use of civil servants to do the work. It also sets out a list of nine 'critical success factors' for getting the best out of consultancy. These include selecting the right consultants at the right price and following through the results of projects. The unit found savings of Pounds 12.2m a year from spending on external consultants which totalled Pounds 508m in 1992-93. But the report says that consultancy does make a contribution to policies which save large amounts. The size of the consultants' contribution is hard to apportion, however. The report says the biggest element of traditional management consultancy work for the civil service has gone into advice on the market-testing programme. Annual savings from this amount to at least Pounds 135m. It says: 'All one can really say with confidence is that external consultancy advice has been an important element in securing substantial quantifiable benefits for government, and that these benefits have been many times greater than the cost of the consultancy itself.' The unit calculates that the report's recommendations would save Pounds 65m a year in payments to consultants and add just Pounds 22m to staff costs. This would make a saving of Pounds 130m in the next three-year public expenditure period. These figures were greeted with scepticism yesterday by leading management consultants. Mr Julian Bagwell, a partner in Touche Ross Management Consultants, said: 'We are not sure that the sort of savings they are talking about can be achieved.' Mr Brian O'Rorke, director of the Management Consultancies Association, said: 'We would question their figures.' He agreed, however, with the majority of the report's practical recommendations. The largest single saving identified by the report was an estimated Pounds 27m from the creation of a central database of previous consultancy projects to prevent duplication. Consultants said, however, that the resemblance between projects was often superficial, meaning that duplication was not as common as the unit believed. Consultants also doubted the scope for civil servants to negotiate large cuts in fees on consultancy projects. Mr David Clinton, a partner of Andersen Consulting, said: 'In my experience the public sector is a pretty good negotiator. You can only negotiate so far.' Mr David Hunt, public service minister, promised that the government would consider the recommendations carefully and draw up plans to take them forward. But he said that the report recorded 'the positive contribution that external consultants have made and can continue to make to the achievement of important government objectives'.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Juan Carlos Santoyos from San Cristobal de las </F> Casas, Chiapas State, for the "Panorama Newscast" -- live]    [Excerpts] The situtation here in San Cristobal de las  Casas, Chiapas State, remains tense even though soldiers have  been deployed here in the main square. This is the situation:  There are problems getting food. Stores are closed in some  areas. Hotels are serving food only to their guests, and it is  just one kind of meal, nothing else. Local drugstores are  finding it difficult to obtain medical supplies as members of  the Zapata National Liberation Army [EZLN] looted the stores  when they arrived. Thus there are no medical supplies for a  medical emergency. It is also worth noting that the Mexican  Army has resumed reconnaissance and surveillance flights all  over the city. Starting at approximately 0700 when the weather  allowed because the fog lifted a little, Mexican Army  helicopters have been flying over San Cristobal de las Casas and  the area 7 km away, where the 31st Military Zone is stationed.    I must also state that local residents are afraid the EZLN  members will resume their activities near the city. Up until  0200 we could hear heavy caliber weapons, chiefly howitzers and  cannons, firing at rebel objectives. Early this morning I had  the opportunity to inspect the city. It was almost deserted.  Fear prevails as the ringing of heavy caliber weapons has been  heard since early in the morning from both far and near. Many  tourists have been stranded here because gas stations are not  observing regular business hours as they fear gasoline may be  rationed. Why is that? Because so far, Pemex [Mexican  Petroleum] trucks have not come to supply the city's three gas  stations. [passage omitted] Stores and schools are closed in  this city. The only thing we see is that a few people are  coming down from the mountain range to try to sell their  products here. In Ocosingo and mainly on the San Cristobal de  las Casas - Ocosingo Highway, a distance of approximately 117  kilometers, military roadblocks are still up to keep people from  entering due to the fierce clashes taking place in the mountain  range, as we were told. Stores, public offices, and houses were  looted in Ocosingo as well. A report states that 15 policemen  were killed in a clash with the EZLN members. Four members of  the Solorzano family were kidnapped. They are local ranchers.    We can also report that in (Chiompla) Municipality a young  woman was brutally beaten and raped for refusing to give food to  the EZLN members. The state government reported that the Army  is in Las Margaritas and Altamirano, although there is no word  yet as to whether the soldiers have been able to enter these  municipalities. The fighting continues. It was also reported  from (Chiompla) that a stronger military operation w??l be  conducted, although the time has not been announced. That is  what is happening now in San Cristobal de las Casas and on the  highway to Ocosingo.</p>

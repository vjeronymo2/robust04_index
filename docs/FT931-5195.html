			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Food and Drink: Appetisers Those who would like an inexpensive holiday with simple food at reasonable cost can pencil in The Worms Head hotel, Rhossili, in south Wales, which is being refurbished by enterprising Welsh chef Colin Pressdee. Pressdee, bouncy presenter of food and recipe ideas on BBC Radio Wales, is busy redecorating and menu planning. The hotel is open now but wait until Easter when the workmen will have departed. Local seafood - try the gratin of laverbread and cockles - and home-cooked hams will more than satisfy the students and keen walkers whom Pressdee hopes to attract. With simple single rooms starting at Pounds 10 a night and ensuite doubles at Pounds 25 he should not have too much trouble filling the 24 bedrooms. Views are stunning. Tel: 0792-390512. ***** Welsh Food Fortnight continues next week with six top Welsh chefs showing some of London's restaurants their secrets. Franco Taruschio is cooking at Turners (071-584-6711), Peter Jackson at the Goring Hotel (071-396-9000), Stephen Bull at his own Bistro (071-490-1750), Chris Chown at Alastair Little (071-734-5183), Dominic Gilbert at Hilaire (071-584-8993) and Dai Davies at the House of Lords (presumably you need a friendly peer to sign you in).</p>

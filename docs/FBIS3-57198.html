Mr.  Fedorov said he intended to meet President Yeltsin early this  week to make a final decision. Boris Fedorov advanced as a  condition for his continued service for the government the  resignation of Vice Premier Aleksandr Zaveryukha, who is  responsible for the agricultural sector, and the Chairman of the  Central Bank Viktor Gerashchenko. For Boris Fedorov, these two  are a symbol of anti-reformist trends in the government.</p>

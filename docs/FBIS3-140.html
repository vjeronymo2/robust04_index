The alleged victims are mainly political  exiles, prisoners, and members of the Jehovah's Witness  religious sect forced into exile into neighboring countries when  their church was banned by the Government of Malawi in the  1970s. Property running into millions of dollars was seized  from members of the sect and taken over by the governing Malawi  Congress Party or its now disbanded militia, the Malawi Young  Pioneers. A former exile and now member of the opposition  United Front for Multiparty Democracy, Mr. Frank Jiya, said that  compensation would be seen as a symbol of apology and  reconciliation to those who had suffered.</p>

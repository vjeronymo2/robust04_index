			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;SW&hyph;02&hyph;AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Availability of NPRMs <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;SW&hyph;02&hyph;AD, 2601 Meacham Blvd., Room 663, Fort Worth, Texas 76137. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On July 13, 1993, the FAA issued AD 93&hyph;14&hyph;06, Amendment 39&hyph;8630 (58 FR 53120, October 14, 1993), to require either a radiographic or a non-destructive inspection of certain main rotor (M/R) drive shafts for cracks, distortion, corrosion, or other surface damage. That action was prompted by an accident resulting from a structural failure of a drive shaft and reports of stress concentrations caused by deep manufacturing tooling marks on the inside surface of the drive shaft. That condition, if not corrected, could result in structural failure of the M/R drive shaft, separation of the M/R from the helicopter, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the issuance of that AD, a commenter states that the FAA incorrectly required inspections of replacement drive shafts with serial number prefixes of ``SZ'' or ``ZS''. The drive shafts with serial numbers containing the ``SZ'' and ``ZS'' prefixes were excluded from the requirements of paragraph (a) of that AD and should have been excluded from the requirements of paragraph (b), but were not. Also, in paragraph (a)(3) of the AD, the commenter states that the FAA incorrectly limited the applicability of the inspection requirements to the Model 269C helicopter for inspection of those M/R drive shafts with serial numbers S1112 and higher. It is the commenter's position that the inspection required by paragraph (a)(3) should apply to all M/R drive shafts with serial numbers S1112 and higher installed on any Model 269 series helicopters, and should not be limited to those installed on the Model 269C as was stated in that AD. The FAA agrees with the commenter and is hereby proposing to supersede AD 93&hyph;14&hyph;06 to incorporate the recommended changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other Schweizer Aircraft Corporation and Hughes Helicopters, Inc. Model 269A, 269A&hyph;1, 269B, 269C, and TH&hyph;55A series helicopters of the same type design, the proposed AD would supersede AD 93&hyph;14&hyph;06 to require a one-time radiographic inspection or a non-destructive inspection of the applicable M/R drive shafts of all Model 269 series helicopters. The proposed AD would also change paragraph (b) of AD 93&hyph;14&hyph;06 to exclude those replacement drive shafts having an ``SZ'' or ``ZS'' prefix from mandatory inspections prior to their installation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA estimates that 1,364 helicopters of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 10 work hours per helicopter to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $818,400. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> The Proposed Amendment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=2 --> PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

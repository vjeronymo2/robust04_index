			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Factors Considered in Developing the Proposed Rental Schedule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed schedule takes into consideration a variety of factors. These factors include (1) recommendations of the Radio and Television Broadcast Use Fee Advisory Committee, (2) market information provided by users, industry groups, private and Government appraisers, and (3) practical considerations associated with developing a cost-effective method for setting and collecting fair market value for communication site use of public lands.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The BLM has incorporated many of the recommendations of the Radio and Television Broadcast Use Fee Advisory Committee regarding use of a schedule instead of individual appraisals to set rental payments, a phase-in period, use of an index to update annual rental payments, and a provision for charging 25 percent of the gross sublease rent. However, the BLM amended the recommended rental schedule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The television schedule recommended by the advisory committee was based on a market ranking system that is no longer published, and the rental payments did not represent fair market value. The advisory committee schedules were based on setting the highest rent for the largest market and for each smaller market dividing the rent in half. The rent suggested by the advisory committee was further reduced by 30 percent to reflect what a majority of members of the advisory committee believed to be the difference between a private lease and BLM or FS authorization. The advisory committee schedule would have resulted in a reduction in current revenues from radio and television use on public lands.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rental schedule for television and radio is higher for certain markets, and lower for others, than the schedule recommended by the advisory committee. This reflects comparable market information, elimination of the suggested 30 percent discount, and an effort to develop a reasonable schedule that covers markets ranging from small rural ones in Montana and Wyoming to larger ones serving Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Reno. To increase fairness, the proposed schedule includes 9 rent levels instead of 6 as recommended by the advisory committee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Market information was obtained from industry groups, individual users, appraisers, and other persons responding to the FS notice. Market information compiled by BLM and FS appraisers was carefully screened to exclude from the rents reported any payment for services such as power, access, building and/or tower space, or maintenance. This information has been compiled by each BLM State Office for purposes of preparing individual appraisals. Since very few appraisals have been prepared over the last 5 years, some of the information is outdated. Therefore, BLM considered more than market information. The public is requested to provide information as to communication site rentals on private land established within the last 3 years. This information would be considered in adjusting the rental schedules proposed in this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A representative sampling of reliable market information to develop a national schedule for a variety of communication uses is difficult to obtain. The information is not readily available, the number of recent transactions is relatively small, and often the information is incomplete or conflicting. Generally, information provided by appraisers is the most complete and has supplemented information provided by various industry groups. This variety of information has been used to establish relative values for various communication uses, depending on population or location criteria.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comparable private leases reflect several factors relevant to market value. One, strategically located mountaintops are valuable for communication purposes. Mountaintop sites allow users to send signals from point to point or deliver a signal that covers a geographical area. Mountaintop communication sites often provide better coverage, and are less expensive to develop, than other alternatives for reaching the same size population.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two, rental payments for broadcast uses are related to the population served by the television or radio transmitter. Strategically located mountaintops serving larger populated areas are generally more valuable than those serving smaller markets. Locations within the same market that provide the best coverage will also rent for more than secondary locations. It should be noted that not all mountaintops have value for broadcast use. The proposed schedule attempts to reflect the rent for typical locations on BLM administered lands, rather than rentals set for specific authorizations and established by appraisals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Three, there is competition for strategically located mountain sites. Private or public mountain locations close to populated areas that have access and power are preferred by broadcast users. There are few places where there is direct competition between private and public sites. The sites used are those that provide the best coverage. However, in many areas rents charged on private lands are higher than rents charged for similarly located sites on public land.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

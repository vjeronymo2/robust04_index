			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / International Company News: New drug sales bolster Chugai Pharmaceutical CHUGAI Pharmaceutical, a leading Japanese drugs company, has attributed a rise in mid-term profits to brisk sales of its new renal anaemia drug. Chugai's non-consolidated pre-tax profits for the six months to June rose 10.2 per cent, to Y6.3bn (Dollars 60.29m), on a 6.4 per cent rise in sales to Y73.1bn. After-tax profits jumped 40.5 per cent to Y2.9bn, although the previous year the company recorded the losses on affiliates' investments. Sales of Chugai's renal anaemia drug, which rose by more than 30 per cent for the first half, offset costs from the company's equity-linked financing, it said. The increase in sales of newly-developed drugs, which have larger margins than existing products, made up for sharp falls in sales of ethical and over-the-counter drugs. For the full year to December, Chugai expects financial investments to contribute to profit growth. The company projects a 16 per cent rise in pre-tax profits, to Y17bn on a 5.4 per cent increase in annual sales to Y151bn. After-tax profits are expected to rise 42.9 per cent to Y7.5bn, and Chugai plans to increase its annual dividend payment to Y9 per share from Y7.5.</p>

This was Pizarro's reaction to a report  from the Libertad Institute.    [Begin recording] [Reporter Marcela Torrejon] Jorge Pizarro,  deputy for the Christian Democratic Party [PDC] and chairman of  the Foreign Relations Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, has  stated that the Libertad Institute's claim that relations  between Chile and Peru are risky is unreasonable. The  Institute, which has ties with the opposition National Renewal  Party, released a document stating that Chilean-Peruvian  relations were risky because the Peruvian Constituent Congress  does not want to ratify the Lima Convention which the Aylwin and  Fujimori administrations had signed to resolve certain matters  that the 1929 peace and friendship treaty had left pending.    Deputy Pizarro believes that the relations between Peru and  Chile are good and pose no political or commercial risks. He  emphasized certain landmarks in the process of rapprochement,  such as Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori's visit to Chile and  the fact that he will also attend President-elect Eduardo Frei's  inauguration in March.    Pizarro acknowledged that after the plebiscite and in light  of the approaching elections, the discussion of the Lima  Convention has awakened nationalistic predjudices which deserve  respect because in Chile too there are people who have this kind  of prejudice. He stressed, however, that in Chile this issue  has always been left in the hands of the state.    [Pizarro] The important thing is to strengthen the role of  the state in setting the course for Chile's foreign policy  toward its neighbors. In this context the report of the  Libertad Institute could be misinterpreted.    [Torrejon] Deputy Pizarro explained that the Chilean  Congress  believes that the Lima Convention should be ratified. This is  not the case with the Peruvian Constituent Congress, where the  majority opposes the ratification of the convention.    [Pizarro] We do not believe that it is appropriate for  Congress, be it Peruvian or Chilean, to revise or amend an  agreement which has already been signed by the foreign ministers  of both countries. Thus, I disagree with the proposal of Mr.  Victor Joy Way, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee of  the Peruvian Constituent Congress, because I feel that he has  taken the wrong approach to the matter which is delaying  ratification of the agreement, and is sending signals that  contradict President Fujimori's stated will to get the  convention approved.    [Torrejon] According to Deputy Pizarro, the explanations  wielded by the Peruvian Constituent Congress in its attempt to  deny approval for the convention which the Aylwin and Fujimori  administrations have already signed are improper.

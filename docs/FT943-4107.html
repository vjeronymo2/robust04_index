			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Perry shares take a 12% tumble to 173p The share price at Perry Group, the motor distributor, dropped 12 per cent yesterday from 198p to 173p. Mr Richard Allan, chairman and chief executive, reacted with surprise, blaming the fall on 'over reaction by the market makers' to August's new car sales figures. Pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30 fell 11 per cent from Pounds 2.87m, which included a Pounds 1.56m property disposal, to Pounds 2.56m. The figures, Mr Allan said, were 'in line with expectations'. Operating profits improved by 29 per cent to Pounds 3.14m (Pounds 2.44m) on turnover up 17 per cent from Pounds 151.2m to Pounds 176.2m. New operations provided operating profits of Pounds 131,000 and turnover of Pounds 1.64m. In his statement to shareholders, Mr Allan said the significant improvement in the first quarter was not sustained in the second, when consumer confidence appeared to stall. New car sales to fleets over the six month period were up 19 per cent, while retail sales rose only 6.5 per cent. The sale of new cars accounted for 50 per cent of turnover but only 17 per cent of gross profits. Mr Allan added that establishment of the new car sales 'hub' , which the company will lease from Ford, was 'taking longer than either would have wished'; until then, he said, the market's full potential would not be unlocked. Earnings per share were 6.6p against 10p, a fall of 34 per cent reflecting last September's rights issue. The interim dividend is unchanged at 2.75p.</p>

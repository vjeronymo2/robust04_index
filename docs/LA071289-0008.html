			<p><P> July 12, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FIRMS CHARGE EPA ADS ARE DIRTY POOL  </P> <P> When he saw an advertisement inviting his former employees to help the U.S.  government nail his company for environmental pollution, Bill Donahoe, owner of  a truck-washing business, was astounded.  </P> <P> "I wondered what country I was living in," Donahoe said. Surely, the United  States of America would not solicit anonymous gossip from disgruntled  ex-employees.  </P> <P> But there it was, an ad in English in the Los Angeles Times and in Spanish in  La Opinion that listed 51 companies topped by the headline: "Ever Worked Here?"  The ad invited those who had worked for the companies to ask themselves whether  they had handled hazardous chemicals and waste and whether the waste was taken  to the Operating Industries Inc. landfill in Monterey Park.  </P> <P> "Please call us!" the ad urged. "Your information can help us at this hazardous  waste site."  </P> <P> Terry Wilson, spokesman for the Environmental Protection Agency's western  region, said the EPA did nothing more than take the sort of action that  attorneys routinely take when they place classified ads seeking witnesses to  clients' traffic accidents.  </P> <P> All of the information received by the agency will be carefully checked by  investigators, he said, as part of an effort to put together a civil case  against companies that shipped hazardous waste to the Monterey Park dump.  </P> <P> The EPA has reached an agreement with more than 100 companies to help pay for  the initial phases of the toxic cleanup of the Operating Industries site by  contributing $33 million in cash and $34 million in work. But no settlement has  been reached with more than 50 other companies that are believed by the EPA to  have shipped hazardous waste to the dump before it was closed because of  environmental problems in 1984.  </P> <P> The settlements reached so far are only for the initial stages of the cleanup  effort. The EPA will seek additional payments to continue the cleanup, which  could eventually cost $200 million to $300 million.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A New Tactic  </P> <P> Wilson said the EPA spent $50,000 on the ads, which ran every other day for two  weeks in The Times and La Opinion. He said the ads were a new tactic, never  before used by the EPA in any of its regions.  </P> <P> The tactic was used in this case, he said, because the agency needs more  information about waste shipments to the Monterey Park site. Some of the  targeted companies claim that their waste was not hazardous, but lack documents  to support that claim, he said.  </P> <P> Wilson refused to say how many calls had been elicited but said: "We had a very  good response -- better than expected."  </P> <P> He said he also "heard from a couple of senior vice presidents who were very  agitated," about their companies being named in the ad.  </P> <P> Roy Leach, owner of Leach Oil Co. in Compton, said the EPA used a "very  low-life tactic," giving his company and others named in the ad a black eye by  implying that they were in trouble with the EPA for wrongdoing.  </P> <P> Actually, his company, an oil recycler, did no more than send waste to a dump  that was licensed by government agencies to receive it, he said.  </P> <P> Under federal law, companies that produce hazardous waste are liable for it  even after they have legally disposed of it. Thus, the EPA is trying to  identify all of the companies that shipped hazardous waste to the Monterey Park  dump and force them to share in the cleanup.  </P></p>

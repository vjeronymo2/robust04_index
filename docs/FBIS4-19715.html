			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, April 21 (AFP) -- The Western allies are  looking at the possibility of carrying out multiple air strikes  against military targets in Bosnia in defence of UN-declared  "safe areas," French Admiral Jacques Lanxade said Thursday [21  April].    The French armed forces chief-of-staff said the issue would  be reviewed at a meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty  Organisation (NATO) Friday in Brussels.    On Wednesday U.S. President Bill Clinton said he was calling  on NATO to harden its military stance in the face of the  continuing Bosnian Serb offensive against the Moslem-held  enclave of Gorazde in eastern Bosnia.    "The idea which is now being looked at for the protection of  the safe areas is a different idea which would consist of being  able to strike with a greater number of planes a series of  military targets in a given area," Lanxade told a news briefing.    Such strikes would be launched "if the rules set by the  Atlantic Alliance and the United Nations are broken," he said.    There should be "a very significant change in conditions for  the use" of NATO fighter aircraft "which would allow the air  force to use its normal means which allow for firing from a safe  distance," Lanxade said.    Close air support requires the presence on the ground of  soldiers to provide guidance for the planes, he said.    Such a tactic, associated with often poor weather in the  Gorazde area, had forced NATO planes to take risks, he added.    One British fighter was shot down last week over Gorazde.    Ambassadors of the 16 NATO countries are to meet Friday to  consider the extension of air strikes in all six safe areas,  NATO diplomatic sources had earlier said.    On Wednesday, the ambassadors had "agreed in principle" to  UN  calls for air strikes to protect civilians in the Gorazde, Zepa,  Srebrenica, Tuzla, and Bihac safe areas. Sarajevo, the sixth  safe area, was given air cover in February when Bosnian Serbs  withdrew their artillery from around the town.</p>

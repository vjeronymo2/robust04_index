			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / UK Company News: O'Reilly builds stake in Conroy Petroleum THE ONGOING battle for control of Conroy Petroleum, the Irish exploration group, took an unexpected turn yesterday with the announcement that Mr Tony O'Reilly, one of the country's leading businessmen, has taken an additional 16.3 per cent stake, writes Tim Coone. Mr O'Reilly has bought out the entire interest of Dundee Bancorp in Conroy through Columbia Investments, a company which he controls. Last month Dundee Bancorp and Outokumpu, the two principal shareholders, successfully ousted Conroy's entire board, including Mr Richard Conroy, the chairman. The two shareholders were incensed at Mr Conroy's decision last year to take over Mr O'Reilly's Atlantic Resources, an ailing oil and gas exploration company. Mr Brendan Gilmore, the new co-chairman, following Mr O'Reilly's increased stake, said: 'We are looking forward to a long-term relationship with Outokumpu at shareholder and board level.' He said that 'no commitments' had been made regarding future ore marketing arrangements but added: 'I would hope we would be able to develop a relationship which would be positive for all the shareholders.' Mr O'Reilly's beneficial interest in Conroy is now 20.5 per cent and together with Mr Conroy and 'those who are deemed to be concert parties with him' now controls a total of 28.9 per cent. The 9.025m shares held by Dundee were sold at 80p each, a substantial premium over the previous day's trading when Conroy's shares closed in London at about 50p.</p>

			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Anglian Water Anglian has come off badly during the recent de-rating of the water sector. With capital spending weighted towards the second half of the decade, it was always geared to the outcome of next year's regulatory review. All the more so since its customers are apparently willing to accept higher bills in the interests of higher standards. Of course Anglian stands to gain more than most from a generous settlement with the regulator. By favouring companies with small capital programmes such as Welsh, the market prefers to believe the worst. Ofwat's obligation to ensure that Anglian can fund itself is some comfort. Allowing interest cover to drift much below three times would leave little to chance. Debt finance could be supplemented by a rights issue, but without attractive prospects for dividend growth Anglian would have to pay a punitive price for fresh equity and Ofwat is committed to ensuring the companies' cost of capital remains reasonably low. The worry is that Ofwat might argue that profits rather than balance sheets should take more of the strain from 1995. More manpower and less expensive equipment, for example, might result in just as clean water. Cheaper capital equipment with a shorter life could also cut capital spending in the short run - but only at the expense of higher depreciation. Such a spending strategy dampened Anglian's profits growth last year. Going into negotiations with Ofwat some moderation of profits is doubtless desirable, but one wonders whether the regulator is taking note.</p>

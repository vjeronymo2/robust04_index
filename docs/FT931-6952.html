			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / International Company News: Alitalia losses contract further ALITALIA, Europe's fourth-largest airline, yesterday reported a further contraction in net group losses during 1992, which fell from L34.5bn to L14.7bn. The Italian state-controlled airline claimed yesterday that it had strengthened its position in the market place. The board, however, warned that 1993 promised to be a difficult year which 'might see a slowdown in the process of renewal and relaunching so positively under way'. During the period 1993-96, Alitalia plans to invest L4,270bn (Dollars 2.76bn). Last year, the airline carried out fleet investment worth L363bn. To cover financial needs of L134bn, assets were sold, including unwanted aircraft worth L101bn. Provision for potential foreign exchange losses as a result of the lira's float since September amounted to L60.3bn. Group revenues rose by 17 per cent to L5,428bn, and if domestic and international traffic carried is measured against 1990 to exclude the anomalous effects of the 1991 Gulf war, the rise was 26 per cent. The load factor edged up to 66.3 per cent compared with 61.3 per cent during the Gulf war year. The airline continued to prune its workforce during the year, with job losses totalling 67. The company claimed productivity had been raised 26 per cent over the past two years. The board gave no estimate of the impact of last December's purchase of a 30 per cent stake in Malev, the Hungarian airline, but in 1991 it had earnings of Dollars 28m.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "No Hidden Intentions"] </F>   [Text] First Chamber President H. Tjeenk Willink has been  appointed to assess on behalf of the crown whether a proposed  government cabinet will succeed. This means that the formation  of a government is now really under way. With appropriate  caution, because the beginning is always difficult and somewhat  arbitrary when the result of the election does not point all  that clearly in one particular direction. There are now two  serious possibilities: A "purple" coalition (comprising the  PvdA, [Labor Party], the VVD [People's Party for Freedom and  Democracy], and the D66 [Democrats 66]) and a center left  coalition. A center right coalition consisting of the CDA  [Christian Democratic Appeal], the VVD, and the D66 will only be  a real option if "purple" turns out not to be a possibility and  the D66 and the PvdA are taken apart.    The opinions of the four main parties revealed a few  differences. All in all, however, they lead to the conclusion --  incidentally, not very surprising -- conclusion that H. Tjeenk  Willink must first test the political will of several parties.  Certainly, bearing in mind the attitude of the PvdA and the  VVD, it would be imprudent to start negotiations on one of the  two plausible coalitions without mature consideration.    Regarding the liberals, it is not clear whether they really  want or will dare to embark on a "purple" coalition. Perhaps  they are ultimately hoping for a right-wing coalition, while  some are also thinking of a continuation of the opposition  deemed to be profitable.    The PvdA is hesitant and divided. One section of the new  party and Minister Van Thijn are calling for the coalition  without the CDA. This is entirely understandable following the  voters' punishing treatment of the Lubbers III government.  However, PvdA leader Kok, the vice prime minister in that  government, appears to be more in favor of complementing his  preferred coalition with the D66.    When forming a government, the right policy does not consist  of negotiating a coalition, while a couple of negotiators are in  fact trying to let these negotiations fail in some devious  manner. Such hidden intentions spoil the atmosphere between the  various parties and give politics the reputation of shiftiness  and incompetence.    Moreover, they may have tiresome consequences for the  negotiators themselves. Next time, they may even find  themselves kicked out, or in a weak position compared with the  newcomers on that occasion. For example, if Kok deliberately  sabotaged the "purple" option, he would have little defense left  against ministerial posts requested by the CDA, provided that he  has not already been marginalized by the D66, because of his  destructive attitude.    Over the next few days, Tjeenk Willink must evaluate the  political will of the VVD and the PvdA as accurately as  possible. On the other hand, these parties must make a serious  choice, even if it proves worse than their expectations. If  they opt clearly for a "purple" coalition, as is to be hoped,  then the formation of such a coalition could still fail for  reasons connected with its content. However, that must not be  allowed to occur due to the lack of goodwill and due to  excessive inflexibility.    It is understandable that some members of the PvdA and the  VVD in particular harbor doubts regarding the possibility of a  "purple" coalition. One important argument, however, is that  taking a crumbling CDA as a partner in government would have  definite disadvantages, namely entailing a shaky leadership,  internal reproaches, and a great desire to establish a fresh  image among the electorate. Not a pleasant mixture.</p>

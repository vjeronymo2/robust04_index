			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / International Company News: Thomson's consumer unit expects FFr500m deficit Thomson Consumer Electronics, a division of Thomson, the French state-owned electronics group, expects to record a net loss of about FFr500m (Dollars 94.3m) this year, in spite of a sharp improvement in operating results, according to Mr Alain Prestat, chairman. Mr Prestat told Les Echos, the French financial newspaper, that operating profits for this year should rise to FFr600m, compared with FFr155m in 1993, but the costs of financing a debt burden of about FFr10bn would pull the company into loss. For 1995, Mr Prestat said the company was on target for operating profits of FFr1bn. The chairman indicated he might seek a capital injection to strengthen the balance sheet. 'I have always been hostile to the idea of asking for a capital injection to cover operating losses. But things can change when these losses have disappeared.' Mr Prestat described an upbeat scenario for the group's products. He cited the success of Direct TV, the first digital television service broadcast by satellite in the US, for which TCE supplies the reception kits. The company aims to sell 360,000 kits this year and to double production capacity to build 1.8m units in 1995. Mr Prestat said he hoped for similar projects in Europe and Asia, from next year or 1996. In multimedia, Mr Prestat raised the prospect of new partnerships. In June, TCE concluded an alliance with Sun Microsystems, the US workstations manufacturer. 'We don't exclude other partnerships, notably in the field of telecommunications,' he said. But he said he did not envisage allying with a personal computer manufacturer because the future home terminal for multimedia would be the television rather than the computer. He appeared sceptical about the prospect of a large investment for an information superhighway, as spelled out in a report to the French government by Mr Gerard Thery, the former managing director of France Telecom. The report calls for an investment of up to FFr200bn by 2015, with much of the expenditure devoted to the development of a national fibre-optic cable network. The concept of a highway leads people to think of it in terms of infrastructure, said Mr Prestat. 'I think, on the contrary, that we should proceed by considering first the market. We must work on the interactive services to study the needs and behaviour of consumers.'</p>

			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / International Company News: AIOC acquires metals unit from Axel Johnson AIOC CORPORATION, a privately-owned New York-based company, is being catapulted into the ranks of the world's leading metals trading groups by acquiring Axel Johnson's raw materials trading subsidiary from the Swedish conglomerate. Mr Alan Clingman, 33, chairman of AIOC and one of its main shareholders, would not give details of the cost of the acquisition, but said both AIOC and Axel Johnson Resources (AJR) had annual sales of more than Dollars 1bn. The merger would make AIOC the biggest independent US-based physical metals trading group, he said. It would give AIOC the chance to 'fill a void' in its international operations because AJR would provide a strong business in Europe. Mr Clingman, who with his partner Mr Alexander Krasner has rapidly expanded AIOC since taking over six years ago, said: 'It is a very logical fit for us. They are strong where we are weak and vice versa.' AIOC has substantial international operations which are strong in the Commonwealth of Independent States and other parts of the former Soviet Union, where it now has eight offices. The group handles the full range of ferrous products from iron ore through speciality steel, including ores, ferro alloys, speciality alloys, pig iron and steel in all its forms, as well as aluminium and its raw materials, bauxite and alumina. AJR will add copper to the list for the first time and substantially increase AIOC's nickel business because the Swedish company has a contract to import nickel, copper and cobalt to Europe from Norilsk in Russia, the world's biggest nickel producer. AIOC employs about 200 people and AJR about 100. Mr Dag Bjurstrom, AJR's managing director, will join the AIOC board. Mr Clingman said there would be opportunities to rationalise where both companies had offices in the same city.</p>

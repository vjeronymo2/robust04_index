			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Government Bonds: Spanish prices tumble as investor confidence wanes SPANISH government bond prices fell sharply yesterday, as the peseta's slide undermined confidence among international investors. Although the bond market opened quite strongly, prices dropped when the Spanish central bank failed to intervene to support the currency at Pta72 against the D-Mark. However, most analysts still expect the Spanish government to stay within the exchange rate mechanism, despite pressing economic problems, particularly unemployment. There was some speculation yesterday that the authorities might try to cut rates and allow the peseta to drift to the bottom of its band. But such a move could prompt greater pressure on the currency. THE Italian bond market also performed poorly yesterday, shedding  1/4 point, as fears over the political situation persisted. Dealers were concerned that the cabinet shuffle over the weekend had not addressed some of the deeper problems. Expectations of a vote of confidence in the next few weeks are expected to continue to depress prices. THE bund market again benefited from a flight to quality, continuing its rally, although further interest rate cuts have already been discounted. Bund contracts on both the London International Financial Futures &amp; Options Exchange and the Deutsche Terminborse broke through resistance levels. But dealers said the latest improvement was sparked more by switching than by outright buying. INVESTORS in Spanish and Italian bonds were seen switching into Dutch, French and Danish paper, as well as bunds, partly based on expectations of interest rate cuts. The Danish bond market was the strongest performer of the day, gaining a full point. Dutch bonds also closed sharply higher, supported by strong domestic buying. The 10-year bond broke through a resistance level at 6 3/4 per cent as the market's rally persisted. UK gilt prices ended virtually unchanged in lacklustre trading yesterday. Slightly stronger than expected GDP data failed to impress traders, who were disappointed that last week's gilts tap totalling Pounds 1.2bn was still not fully sold. LONGER-dated US Treasury prices turned sharply higher yesterday afternoon pushing the 30-year bond's yield to a record low. The benchmark 30-year government bond had a yield of 6.931 per cent in late trading, its lowest level since the issue was first sold to the public in 1997. The long bond was quoted  7/8 higher at 102 5/16 . Movement was less dramatic at the short end of the market, where the two-year note firmed 1/32 to yield 3.927 per cent. In the absence of important economic news yesterday, the market remained focused on President Bill Clinton's deficit reduction package. Some players remain enthusiastic about his willingness to tackle the federal deficit, along with measures which should slow the rate of economic growth in 1994, But others were concerned that spending cuts might not be sufficient to keep inflation in check. The Federal Reserve entered the open market to arrange Dollars 2.5bn of customer repurchase agreements when Fed funds were trading at 3 per cent. There was also some positioning ahead of today's Dollars 15.25bn two-year note auction and tomorrow's Dollars 11bn five-year note auction.</p>

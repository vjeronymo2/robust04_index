			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading UNCERTAINTY over the prospect of a fall in UK interest rates unsettled stock index futures, writes Joel Kibazo. Having opened firmly at 2,570, the March contract soon retreated as independent traders who had taken on long positions overnight led the selling activity. The contract had fallen to 2,551 by mid-morning. The release of wholesale price inflation figures in line with analysts' forecasts briefly curtailed March's downward direction and in fact produced a brief rally. However, selling pressure returned and was only eased later in the afternoon by a firm Wall Street. But this did not last. March closed at 2,550, around three points above the estimated fair value premium to cash of about 10. In traded options, turnover reached a meagre 17,173 contracts. British Airways, which produced better than expected results, was the busiest stock option. It traded 2,970 lots, with the July 260 calls the busiest series. This was followed by British Aerospace with a day's total of 2,250. The May 330 calls were particularly active. Hanson was the third busiest stock option, trading 1,030 contracts. BTR and Lonrho were also active.</p>

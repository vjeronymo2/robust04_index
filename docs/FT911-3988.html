			<p>910422 FT  22 APR 91 / Mulroney makes big changes in Canadian cabinet CANADA'S LONG-SERVING finance and external affairs ministers have both been assigned new duties in the most extensive cabinet shuffle since Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's Progressive Conservative government took office seven years ago. Mr Michael Wilson, who has held the Finance Ministry post since 1984, is taking over an expanded international trade and industry portfolio, where he will be in charge of Canada's negotiations with the US and Mexico on a North American free trade agreement. Mr Joe Clark, the external affairs minister, has been named president of the Privy Council and chairman of a new cabinet committee on constitutional affairs. Mr Clark, who served briefly as prime minister in 1979, will have the job of finding a constitutional formula to keep Quebec in Canada without alienating the other provinces. He has the dual advantage of coming from Alberta and, unlike most westerners, being bilingual. The new finance minister is Mr Don Mazankowski, who is deputy prime minister and has a wealth of political experience, but only limited exposure to either domestic or international economic issues. Mr Clark is succeeded at external affairs by Ms Barbara McDougall, who previously held the immigration portfolio. Yesterday's cabinet shuffle is an important part of Mr Mulroney's preparations both for the forthcoming constitutional talks with Quebec, and for the next general election, which is likely to be held late next year or in early 1993. The Conservatives have a popularity rating of less than 20 per cent but are given a reasonable chance of bouncing back if the constitutional talks go well, the economy revives, and if they can outflank two regional parties in Quebec and the west which have recently siphoned off a substantial part of their support. Mr Clark and Mr Wilson are both considered to have performed well in their previous portfolios, but electoral and other domestic political considerations appear to have dictated their moves. Mr Wilson, for instance, has become closely identified with the goods and services tax implemented earlier this year, and with other unpopular measures to hold down inflation. Mr Mulroney also needs a new face at the constitutional talks to help defuse bitterness caused by the collapse last year of the Meech Lake accord, which aimed to bring Quebec into the 1982 constitution. Other changes in the cabinet: Mr John Crosbie (trade) goes to fisheries; Mr Bill McKnight (defence) to agriculture; Mr Marcel Masse (communications) to defence; Mr Benoit Bouchard (industry) to health. Mr Jean Charest, who resigned as sport minister in a scandal in 1989, has returned as environment minister.</p>

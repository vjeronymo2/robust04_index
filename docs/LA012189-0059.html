			<p><P> January 21, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STALIN'S WAR LEADERSHIP CRITICIZED IN SECRET MEMOIRS OF KEY MARSHAL  </P> <P> Pravda on Friday published previously secret sections of the memoirs of World  War II Marshal Georgy Zhukov that blast Josef Stalin's war leadership and blame  him for the annihilation of thousands of Soviet citizens.  </P> <P> The memoirs in the Communist Party daily shattered the Soviet image of Stalin  as a war hero.  </P> <P> The dictator depicted himself as the savior of the Soviet Union during the war,  which killed at least 20 million in the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> The image has endured despite Western studies that blame a large part of the  Soviet losses on Stalin's purge of the Red Army officer corps in the late 1930s  and on his refusal to believe that Nazi leader Adolf Hitler could turn on him  and order a German invasion.  </P> <P> Zhukov was deputy commander-in-chief of the Soviet armed forces during the war,  second only to Stalin himself. Zhukov is considered a hero of the defense of  Moscow and Stalingrad.  </P> <P> Pravda quoted Zhukov's daughter, Maria, as saying the marshal's memoirs often  have been cited by Stalinists as proof that Stalin was a magnificent leader  rather than the criminal portrayed in recent Soviet publications.  </P> <P> But Maria Zhukova said key sections of her father's writings were left hidden  in his safe for publication at some future, less dangerous, date.  </P> <P> "Many thousands of outstanding party workers, members of the armed forces,  faithful patriots of the motherland and talented leaders of the country were  annihilated by the order of Stalin," from 1937 to 1939, Zhukov wrote. "Of  course, one cannot forgive Stalin."  </P> <P> The full page of excerpts in Pravda included Zhukov's report that Stalin played  no role in directing the war effort.  </P></p>

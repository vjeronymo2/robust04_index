			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Israel, S Korea in air accord Israel and South Korea have initialled a civil aviation agreement that should allow direct flights between the two countries by early next year and considerably boost the tourist trade, writes Julian Ozanne in Jerusalem. El Al, Israel's state-owned airline due to be privatised later this year, has said that it wishes to fly to Seoul as soon as possible as part of its route expansion programme focussed on Asia. Israel's tourism ministry, however, criticised the ministry of transport for mishandling the agreement by not providing for the immediate establishment of scheduled flights between the two countries.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri said Thailand  needs to be more cautious about looking after the Thai border if  some countries decide to arm Cambodian government forces against  the Khmer Rouge.    Speaking after his return from an official visit to the  United Kingdom yesterday, Foreign Minister Prasong called for  the solving of the Cambodian problem through negitiations  instead of military means.    He said the military aid to Cambodia might escalate fighting  along the Thai-Cambodian border thus affecting Thai villagers  living in the area. The foreign minister said as long as  fighting continues, genuine and lasting peace cannot be achieved  in Cambodia.    He said the Cambodian issue was also raised for discussion  with British leaders so that they clearly understood Thailand's  stand on the issue.    He said Thailand has been providing assistance to Cambodia  to  help in the reconstruction of the country. The assistance is in  the forms of military uniforms, road improvement, construction  of schools and hospitals, and technical aid. The assistance is  not aimed at encouraging fighting inside that country. This is  because Thailand wishes to see peace in Cambodia.</p>

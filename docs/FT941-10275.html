			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Technology: Healed to the bone Methods of performing complex bone surgery are being revolutionised by stereolithography, a laser technique developed for industry. By combining this with medical tomography scans or magnetic resonance imaging, precise three-dimensional models of a patient's bone structure can be created, enabling surgeons to tackle operations that might otherwise be too dangerous. The technology is used in Europe to assist about 40 surgical operations a year, says Norbert Mucheyer, president of Mucheyer Engineering in Germany. It has been applied particularly to skull-related surgery. In one case, says Mucheyer, surgeons were reluctant to operate, fearing damage to an eye nerve and loss of vision, until the stereolithography model enabled them to locate the path of the nerve and perform risk-free surgery. Stereolithography involves selective hardening of a liquid polymer resin by the action of a computer-controlled laser beam. Linked to a computer-aided design station, the technique converts 3-D designs into a solid model. Before reconstructing damaged bone structure, a surgeon needs to visualise the location and condition of all the bone segments. He must also plan how to rebuild the structure, which may involve transferring segments of bone and developing prostheses, plates and implants. The usual method of visualising such a surgical problem is to view and analyse a scan of the patient on screen. With a solid model, the surgeon can practise cutting up the bone, check the amounts to be moved and prepare appropriate prostheses. Scans generated by tomography can be used as the data for the laser stereolithography but this is time-consuming and costly. Companies like Siemens in Germany, Zeneca in the UK and Belgian-based Materialise are working with the Catholic University in Leuven, Belgium, on a project to create a system for producing medical models.</p>

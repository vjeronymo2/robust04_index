			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Industrial unrest erupts in France THE Balladur government today faces its first serious bout of industrial unrest since taking power last spring with French airline, railway, telecommunications and postal workers planning strikes or stoppages. The public sector companies affected by disputes, triggered by government attempts to curb its pay bill, include Air France, the railway operator SNCF, and RATP, which runs the regional transport system around Paris. Air France has warned that it may be able to provide only half its scheduled flights. The railway network is also likely to be disrupted by the SNCF stoppage, as it was last week on some lines. RATP employees plan to stop work for two hours in the late morning and early evening. There will also be stoppages among utility workers at France Telecom and at EDF-GDF, the electricity and gas group, where employees have threatened to run only a limited service. Retail price inflation accelerated in September, as prices rose 0.4 per cent during the month, taking the annualised increase to 2.3 per cent, according to provisional figures from Insee, the statistics institute.</p>

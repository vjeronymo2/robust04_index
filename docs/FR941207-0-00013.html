			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Liquidated Damages  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 250.30(c)(4)(iv)(B) of the current State processing regulations provides for termination of the processing contract when there has been noncompliance with its terms and conditions by the contracting agency or the processor. However, it has been the Department's experience that there have been circumstances where termination of processing contracts would seriously affect the ability of recipient agencies to purchase processed end products. Rather than terminating contracts for non-compliance with the contract provisions, the Department believes that there could be some middle ground established where instances of non- compliance could be better handled by means of assessing damages against the non-performing party of the contract under the State processing program. To accomplish this, the proposed rule requested comments from interested parties on ways to handle instances of program violations, short of contract termination. Commenters were requested to identify areas of non-compliance that have created the greatest problems in the past as well as the type and amounts of reasonable damages for non-compliance with specific provisions of the processing agreement to be applied against a processor. These liquidated damages were to be based on the severity and nature of the program violations identified, in order to ensure consistent application of the requirement. Additionally, comments were solicited regarding the incorporation of the liquidated damages provision of the NCP agreement into the NCP regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Twelve comments were received in response to this proposal. Ten commenters were opposed to the inclusion of a liquidated damages provision in the State processing and the NCP regulations. Many of these commenters stated that while the concept of establishing conditions of non-compliance in lieu of contract termination could be useful as an incentive for processors to adhere to contract requirements, addressing these conditions in Federal regulations is not appropriate. Rather than include such provisions in Federal regulations, six commenters stated that distributing agencies should be encouraged to identify liquidated damages assessments in a special provisions article of the processing agreement. Three commenters expressed concern that inclusion of a liquidated damages provision could deter processors from participating in the processing programs. Three commenters expressed concern that State laws are too varied and that such provisions may invoke unnecessary or excessive charges against processors, which could ultimately result in higher fees charged to recipient agencies. One commenter stated that most instances of non-compliance fall into the area of recordkeeping problems, such as failure to submit reports in a timely manner or to maintain production records. The commenter stated that the best way to handle such occurrences is for the distributing agency to work directly with the processor to resolve these problems rather than to impose fines. Two commenters stated that adding a liquidated damages provision to the NCP regulations would create undue hardship on a single processor with contracts in multiple states. Three commenters stated that there was no need for a liquidated damages provision because the bond was sufficient to cover the loss of any donated food. However, a different view point toward the bond coverage was expressed by two commenters who were in favor of including a liquidated damages provision. One of these commenters stated that since the bond only covers loss of inventory or loss of commodity, a liquidated damages provision would be appropriate if very carefully written so that good processors would not be deterred from program participation and that such a provision could not be punitive in nature. The other commenter in favor of a liquidated damages provision stated that while performance bonds do provide some relief, they do not adequately compensate the State or the recipient agencies for the additional administrative work which can result when a processor violates the provisions of the processing regulations and agreement provisions. This commenter stated that a well-constructed liquidated damages provision may enable the distributing agency to collect penalties which could be used to offset the administrative work that is generated by such violations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the Department recognizes the need to have a means of addressing non-compliance with program and contract provisions, other than contract termination, the majority of the commenters' recommendations stated that it would be inappropriate for the Department to develop a liquidated damages provision that would be applicable to all distributing agencies nationwide. Based on these comments, the Department believes that handling such instances of non-compliance is best left to the discretion of the distributing agencies. Therefore, this rule does not require that a liquidated damages provision be included in the State processing contract. However, as a means of ensuring compliance with all requirements of the processing contract short of contract termination, the Department strongly encourages the inclusion of a liquidated damages provision or other similar provision in the processing contract. As discussed in the preamble to the proposed State processing regulations, there are circumstances in which termination of processing contracts would seriously affect the ability of recipient agencies to purchase processed end products, and thus, termination is not always a practical option for less significant contract noncompliance. It has been the Department's experience in NCP that a liquidated damages provision has been a useful method of ensuring full compliance with the terms of the contract. The Department will continue to appraise the use and effectiveness of liquidated damage provisions or other intermediate alternatives to contract termination by distributing agencies and will address this issue in the future if warranted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since FCS serves as the distributing agency in the NCP Program, and because this provision has been successfully applied in the past to address instances of non-compliance, the liquidated damages article that is currently part of the NCP agreement will remain unchanged. The Department plans to raise this issue with the distributing agencies participating in the State processing program to determine whether it is appropriate to incorporate a similar provision in State processing contracts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Alternate Value Pass-Through Systems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 250.30(d)(1)(iii) of the proposed State processing regulations and section 252.4(c)(4)(iii) of the proposed NCP regulations would permit FCS to take the paperwork and resource burden associated with using the alternate value pass-through systems into consideration when determining whether an alternate system should be approved. The proposed rule would also reserve to FCS the right to deny approval of systems which are labor- intensive and provide no greater accountability than systems specifically described for use by the current regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

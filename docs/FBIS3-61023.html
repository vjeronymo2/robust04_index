			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Colonel-General Viktor Andreyevich Kopylov, </F> commander, Siberian Military District, by KRASNAYA ZVEZDA  correspondent Aleksandr Veklich: "Siberian MD: Officer  Companies, Officer Battalions"; date and place not given; first  paragraph is KRASNAYA ZVEZDA introduction]    [Text] In the last 30 months, the Siberian Military  District has taken in about 100 units and large units formerly  stationed in distant and neighboring countries. Questions  relating to problems of providing the necessary level of combat  readiness and maintaining troop command and control were put by  our correspondent to Colonel General Viktor Kopylov, commander,  Siberian Military District.    "Our training," said Viktor Andreyevich, "was before and  remains as the rock-bottom requirement. This, in spite of the  fact that today it must be organized under conditions of an  enormous personnel shortage. The table of organization and  equipment of units and large units is only now being finalized.  Nevertheless, the district's authorities and the military  council maintain their viewpoint, even in light of the  difficulties, that our district, which is far removed from the  "hot spots," was before and remains as the most favorable  relative to organizing combat training. As far as the practical  side of the problem is concerned, I can say that in those units  in which there are personnel present and combat vehicle crews  supplied, the people have been especially well-trained in  accomplishing unexpected missions."    [Veklich] Let us make that more definite. Let us assume that  a motorized rifle regiment receives a combat alert signal. Are  the regiment's subunits in a position to execute a timely  departure from their permanent deployment garrisoning location  with their combat materiel, accomplish a march of let us say 500  kilometers, and then perform the particular mission assigned?    [Kopylov] As far as extreme conditions are concerned, we  have  found a way to maintain unit combat capability. We redeploy our  personnel and equipment so as not to spread too thinly our  woefully inadequate number of specialists. We reassign some  specialists to make up for manpower deficits in subunits, so  that the latter can assume a state of complete readiness to  undertake any mission. Others are trained to man equipment, in  the event of an irregular situation, to enable them to move  combat vehicles out of motor pools before the reserve is  mobilized. This approach has become associated with the need to  devote greater attention to individual training of personnel. We  have come to make more extensive use of fighting vehicle gunnery  training facilities and simulators.    [Veklich] But there is quite a number of units consisting of  officers only. They sometimes must carry out not only their  regular duties, but other duties as well, such as guard duty and  servicing and repair of equipment.    [Kopylov] The problem is indeed serious. The conduct of  company or battalion tactical exercises in reduced-strength  units produces poor results. Also, an officer who has not worked  through problems of commander's training and fire control and  who is lacking personnel to boot simply faces the threat of  disqualification. With this kind of situation in mind, we in the  district took the route of creating, on the basis of units,  reduced-strength officer battalions and companies. This year's  experience shows that our action has been justified. A young  school graduate - a platoon leader - who lacks personnel due to  no fault of ours can in the course of an integrated exercise  hone his skills both in the role of a BMP [combat infantry  vehicle] driver-mechanic or sniper, something which will  undoubtedly be of use to him, and in subunit command and control  and combat organization. And so it goes up the chain of command,  to regimental commander.    Although we have employed the above procedure as an  experiment, in the new training year integrated training of  officers lacking personnel under their command will become a  part of routine combat training.    [Veklich] The Siberian Military District recently  participated in the operational-strategic command and staff  exercise "Center." What goals were achieved?    [Kopylov] The district was generally rated highly. We  carried  out a number of actions on an experimental basis. We drew up  proposals based on them for submission to the General Staff.  This included problems that surfaced. For example, uncovered in  the course of the exercise was a drop in readiness of motor  vehicles, which in the event of an actual combat situation would  be supplied to district units. I see the cause as lying in an  attitude deterioration in the management of motor vehicle  organizations and of other enterprises that have shifted to the  market economy for the accomplishment of state tasks. Also, the  motor vehicle fleet is aging due to a lack of replacement parts.  It can become completely inoperative. Also leaving something to  be desired is the professional training possessed by a certain  number of drivers working for the enterprises.    In a word, "Center" made it possible to evaluate the  district's actual capabilities and set goals to work toward,  once again based on our capabilities in an environment of  personnel shortages.    [Veklich] Viktor Andreyevich, it is a fact that special  importance is being attached to troop command and control. What  are the prospects for providing the district's command and  control elements with modern automation and communication  equipment?    [Kopylov] We have devised a plan for improving command and  control facilities; its implementation has already produced  tangible results. For example, the PVO [air defense] command and  control facility has been completely automated. We have a  display system there, and have set up direct communication with  the PVO strany [country] command and control facility. Thus, we  were able to reduce district PVO command and control and  reorganize the cooperation process. By examining the problems of  air defense, we see solutions in a unified PVO strany system. A  major role should undoubtedly be played by large units of the  PVO Voysk [troops] of Russia located in the district's  territory. We enjoy good communication with them. We also plan  to undertake certain measures related to reorganizing and  improving a number of other fixed and field command and control  facilities.    [Veklich] How have those persons who are on duty on the  basis  of contract service contributed toward the maintenance of combat  readiness?    [Kopylov] Presently in the district there are about 3,000  servicemen of that kind. The contract arrangement has enabled us  to effect a considerable correction in shortages of all  categories of drivers. Vehicles are now being operated by  professionals, with the result that the number of district motor  vehicle accidents has been halved this year. Presently serving  in a number of military collectives are entire subunits  consisting of "pros." Even this rather limited experiment shows  that maximum benefit is derived from service by contractors when  they are brought together into a company or battalion. This  makes it possible to provide them with more intensive training.    However, I think that there is as yet no firm economic  backing to bind the contract serviceman to the Armed Forces. In  my opinion, if a person who has signed a contract to serve for  three years wishes to receive a discharge after one year, he  should be made to pay a penalty.    [Veklich] Viktor Andreyevich, now for the last question. Is  it possible that Siberian soldiers may find themselves facing  the present obviously difficult Siberian winter without heat in  the barracks, while officers' families may not have a roof over  their heads?    [Kopylov] I take pleasure in saying that this year  commanders  of the district's KEU [billing directorate] headed by Colonel  Grigoriy Kuyan and rear services officers have done much to  prepare all personnel comfort systems for the long Siberian  winter. All the district's boiler rooms are in working  condition, with reserve boilers installed. There is a six-month  supply of fuel. However, it is true that personnel difficulties  exist. We are losing qualified rear services specialists to  places paying half again to twice as much. That is why this  winter we must continue to resort to assigning conscripts to  servicing of boiler rooms.    Concerning having a roof over one's head, I wish to point  out  that we do not have a single case of an officer assigned to a  withdrawal unit living out in the open. Thus, we made 40  apartments available to recently arrived aviators. They will be  assigned another several dozen apartments in the near future.  That is to say, we act like good hosts to people coming to us  from beyond the border, even though the number of our people in  need of an apartment exceeds 3,000.    I think that we would be able to resolve the housing problem  if there were no difficulties with financing.</p>

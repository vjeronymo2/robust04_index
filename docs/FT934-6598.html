			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Arts: Today's Television Not a night for FT readers to go to the cinema. BBC2's 'The Money Programme' mounts a 60-minute special, Unusual Transactions (BBC2, 8.00), about Asil Nadir and Polly Peck's missing millions. It claims 'Exclusive first-hand testimony from those involved helps to shed new light on what went so badly wrong'. The minute that ends, Dispatches (C4, 9.00) undertakes a hatchet job on the Treasury. CBI director Howard Davis describes the Treasury as 'the bank that likes to say no', and economist Tim Congdon declares 'It is not a matter of opinion whether their forecasting record is poor, it is a matter of fact.' No doubt the last episode of The Buddha Of Suburbia (BBC2, 9.25) will achieve record ratings thanks to the publicity stunt laid on by the tabloids. 'Buddha's sex romp goes on as the BBC refuses to make cuts' snorted the Mail; 'Shame of BBC's Porn Play' screamed The Sun, providing photo after photo to illustrate the nature of the shame. The fact that this is a highly entertaining comedy about the absurdities of the 1970s was never mentioned, of course.</p>

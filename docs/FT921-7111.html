			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Waldegrave hints at competition for care cash THE possibility of the government extending the concept of local authorities competing for funds to community care was yesterday suggested by Mr William Waldegrave, health secretary. Mr Waldegrave said that the City Challenge approach, under which local authorities compete for money to finance urban renewal, might help stimulate councils in their new community care responsibilities. With the health service reforms introduced, ministers are giving increasing attention to the second half of the National Health Service and Community Care Act. This involves changes next year in the care of elderly and handicapped people in the community. Local authorities will be responsible for co-ordinating the new arrangements. Councils around the country are at varying stages of readiness for the changes. Mr Waldegrave told the conference there was wide evidence that incentives built into the health reforms were already releasing pressures to produce better value for money. Managers were attempting to plan ahead prudently and avoid the kind of stop-go policies which had made patients subservient to organisational needs in the past. Labour said last week that it would abolish the reforms if elected, but Mr Waldegrave said the changes were gaining momentum and 'a reversion to the situation prevailing before the reforms is unthinkable'.</p>

			<p><P> May 29, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FRENCH OPEN;  </P> <P> LENDL AND GRAF STILL APPEAR TO BE A CUT ABOVE  </P> <P> On the clay courts of Roland Garros Stadium, a tennis complex named for a World  War I French fighter pilot, Ivan Lendl is on a mission.  </P> <P> The $4.5-million French Open, the year's second Grand Slam event, begins today  on the red caked clay that gets on your socks, over your shoes and sometimes in  your heart.  </P> <P> There may be no greater lover of Grand Slam tournaments than Lendl, who has won  seven of them, including three at Roland Garros. Lendl already has the  Australian Open title to his credit, which means he could be on his way to  becoming this year's Mats Wilander with a victory here.  </P> <P> Wilander won it last year, of course, and also the Australian and U.S. Opens,  but has since fallen upon difficult times. His match-play record this year is  only 8-8.  </P> <P> At Roland Garros, groundskeepers drag the courts between matches, as a grounds  crew would drag the infield at a baseball game. If Wilander's plight gets any  worse, they may have to drag the Seine.  </P> <P> Lendl, on the other hand, is at the top of his game. In seven tournaments this  year, he has reached the final six times and won five, losing only to Stefan  Edberg at the Japan Open. In the only tournament in which Lendl did not make  the final, he lost to John McEnroe in the semifinals of the WCT Finals in  Dallas.  </P> <P> However, McEnroe is not playing here because of a bad back. Instead, McEnroe is  taking this week off, then playing a grass-court event in Beckenham, England,  to prepare for Wimbledon.  </P> <P> Top-seeded for the fourth consecutive year, Lendl's 33-2 record this year is  the best by any man in the tournament.  </P> <P> Fifteen of the top 20 players in the world are entered and the winner will earn  $291,752.  </P> <P> The women's singles does not seem quite as competitive as the men after the  withdrawal of Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert. Back-to-back champion Steffi  Graf becomes an even greater favorite to win her third consecutive event with  the absence of two of her principal nemeses.  </P> <P> Graf's stiffest challenge for the $257,379 championship money may come from  second-seeded Gabriela Sabatini, third-seeeded Natalia Zvereva or possibly a  pair of 17-year-old Spaniards -- Arantxa Sanchez and Conchita Martinez.  </P> <P> Sabatini, 19, is the only player to have beaten Graf this year. Graf's 39-1  record would be perfect except for a 3-6, 6-3, 7-5 loss to Sabatini in April at  a tournament in Amelia Island, Fla., which was also played on clay.  </P> <P> Graf, who will be 20 four days after the end of the tournament, got a rematch  with Sabatini last week in Berlin and won, 6-3, 6-1.  </P> <P> If Graf celebrates her birthday with a victory here, she would become only the  first woman to win three consecutive French Open titles since Hilde Sperling of  Germany (1935-37).  </P> <P> Tennis notes  </P> <P> Steffi Graf, top-seeded and No. 1 in the world, plays the first match on center  court today against Camille Benjamin, who lives in Bakersfield. Benjamin is  ranked No. 88. . . . Ninth-seeded Jimmy Connors follows Graf onto center court  for his first-round match against Martin Strelba of Czechoslovakia. . . .  Gabriela Sabatini debuts on center court after Connors, against Akemi Nishiya  of Japan. . . . Jim Pugh of Palos Verdes drew second-seeded Boris Becker for a  first-round match, which will probably be scheduled for Tuesday. . . . Graf is  dating 24-year-old fellow West German player, Alexander Mronz. German reporters  already are having a field day with the news, referring to Mronz as "Mr. Graf."  </P></p>

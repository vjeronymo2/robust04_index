Although  nothing has been disclosed about the details of these talks, the  statements made by the Palestinian and Israeli parties  demonstrate that the main differences and pending issues remain  unresolved. Reaching a solution will require very prolonged  talks. The latest 'Arafat- Peres meeting, the third over the  past two months, focused on extricating bilateral talks on the  Gaza-Jericho agreement from an impasse.    It is well-known that Israeli stalling prevented  implementation of the agreement's clauses, which should have  taken effect on 13 December 1993. Israel put forward its own  interpretations and analyses of the clauses of the agreement,  which practically blocked its implementation. Political  observers believe that despite the fact that both Palestinian  and Israeli parties declared that they reached a limited accord,  Zionist officials have reneged on implementing the Gaza-Jericho  agreement by putting forward new interpretations of its  articles. Under the latest agreement the Zionists imposed  Israeli military supervision of the crossing points and border  points in Gaza and Jericho with the participation of Palestinian  police. This means that Zionist forces will continue to impose  their control over the self-rule areas, albeit with a  Palestinian police cover. According to the Gaza-Jericho  agreement signed in Washington, control of the crossing points,  bridges, and border points separating Gaza and Jericho from  Egypt and Jordan is the responsibility of the interim government  in the self-rule area. From the outset of the negotiations, the  Palestinian party emphasized the Palestinians' sole right to  control the crossing and border posts along with other tasks in  their occupied homeland. The Zionist entity, as usual, resorted  to blatant stalling, refusing to implement the agreement's  clauses on the scheduled date in order to impose conditions on  the Palestinians and to shake the PLO leader's standing among  the Palestinian people. These complications have further  darkened the prevailing pessimistic atmosphere in the occupied  lands regarding the agreement and the possibility of  implementing it. The Palestinians, who were at first  enthusiastic and pinned hopes on the United States, have now  begun to wonder if it is really possible to regain their usurped  rights through diplomatic means from the usurper Zionist entity.</p>

			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / International Company News: Seagram raises stake in Time Warner to 13.1% Seagram, the international drinks group, has lifted its interest in Time Warner, the multi-media giant, to 13.1 per cent from 11.7 per cent. The cost of buying another 5m Time Warner shares between February 4 and February 25 was Dollars 192m. The average price ranged from Dollars 37.75 to Dollars 39.37 per share. Seagram last reported a Time Warner share acquisition on January 20, when 5m shares were bought for Dollars 205m. Seagram, which owns almost 25 per cent of Du Pont, the chemicals giant, now holds 49.2m Time Warner shares, up from 44.2m on January 20. Early last summer, Mr Edgar Bronfman Sr, the chairman, announced that Seagram had begun buying Time Warner stock in the market and was aiming at a 15 per cent stake for a total investment of USDollars 2bn. Mr Bronfman insisted that his intentions were friendly. The Bronfman families of New York and Montreal hold controlling interests in Seagram. In January Time Warner set up a 'poison pill' designed to frustrate any take-over and make any hostile bid prohibitively expensive.</p>

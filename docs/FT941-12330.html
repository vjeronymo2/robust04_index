			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Hitch in flight to Cyprus outside airline's control Sir, We refer to Mr Skapinker's article (Business Travel: 'Long day's journey', January 10) regarding the disruption caused to British Airways' flight from Heathrow on December 27 1993 and Cyprus Airways' flight from Heathrow on December 28 1993, as a result of the civil servants' strike in Cyprus. This lightening strike occurred on a bank holiday late in the evening and there was insufficient notice. Cyprus Airways and British Airways, (which acts as the handling agents of Cyprus Airways), the two affected airlines flying from London Heathrow to Cyprus, followed the same policy for their passengers. Although the strike was outside our control and the airline is not liable, we would like to apologise to Mr Skapinker and indeed to all of our customers for any inconvenience caused and assure them of our best attention when they next fly with us. A Demetriou, regional manager, northern Europe, Cyprus Airways, Euston Centre, 29/31 Hampstead Road, London NW1 3JA</p>

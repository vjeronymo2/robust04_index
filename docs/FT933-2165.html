			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Bosnia talks again fail to progress SECRET talks on board a British warship aimed at securing a Bosnian peace deal ended in failure last night, according to United Nations officials. International mediators said there had been some progress but acted swiftly to call off a meeting at Sarajevo airport today, at which Bosnia's three ethnic leaders were supposed to sign a peace deal. The decision came after a last-minute attempt to wring concessions from Serb and Croat powerbrokers and win endorsement from Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian president, for the republic's partition plan, ended without success. 'There won't be a meeting in Sarajevo tomorrow because all sides have not shown sufficient flexibility', said Mr John Mills, spokesman for mediators Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg. The collapse of prospects for a speedy settlement occurred after the two envoys had sequestered Mr Izetbegovic and his Serb and Croat adversaries for secretive meetings on board a British naval vessel. They tried to persuade Bosnian Croat leader Mate Boban and his patron Mr Franjo Tudjman, president of Croatia, to grant access to ports on the Adriatic ports to the mostly Moslem republic of Mr Izetbegovic - one of three ethnic statelets envisaged under the partition plan. Mr Mills cited progress after the meetings. But details were unavailable. The mediators earlier had announced that the three leaders would sign a deal today at Sarajevo airport. The talks on board the carrier HMS Invincible appeared to be aimed at stepping up pressure, especially on the isolated Mr Izetbegovic. But it was unclear how they intended to squeeze more land out of victorious Serb and Croat leaders who at the weekend reiterated their refusal to make concessions. Mr Izetbegovic on September 1 rejected the proposed maps because they left his republic land-locked with slim prospects for economic viability. Mr Slavisa Rakovic, adviser to Mr Karadzic, was unmoved last night in Pale, the mountain stronghold of the self-styled Bosnian Serb state, by the breakdown of talks. He dismissed Mr Izetbegovic's rejection as 'manoeuvring'. He appeared to believe that the outgunned, besieged Moslems would have little choice but to sign the proposed package sooner or later. The key sticking points remain Serb refusal to restore parts of eastern Bosnia which were mostly Moslem before the war to Moslem control and Croat intransigence over ports on the Adriatic. Russia may be unwilling to send extra troops to help enforce a peace agreement in Bosnia, General Pavel Grachev, its defence minister, has indicated, writes David White in Moscow. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, British defence secretary, said General Grachev made clear in talks yesterday that he was not contemplating an increase.</p>

			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Observer: Abrasive He may not rate as high as Kitty Kelley for tittle-tattle but Kjell-Olof Feldt, Sweden's former finance minister, is disturbing the country's placid public life with his newly published memoirs. He was one of the country's few political heavyweights before resigning in angry despair 14 months ago on failing to convince party colleagues of what he felt was needed to revive the economy. Now his bitterness has erupted in a book that will do nothing to help his party's already hopeless chances in September's general election. Sweden has known nothing like it. When its politicians produce memoirs, they are usually produce bland and boring. Moreover, the Social Democrats used to pride themselves on loyalty and discretion. Feldt is different; writing of his main party opponent, blue-collar unionist Stig Malm: 'With him as a friend, who needs enemies'. Feldt's ex-comrades may well say the same of him as they assess the damage his book will do to their party's prospects. Abrasive on the Denis Healey pattern, Feldt likens his 1980s efforts to win wage-restraint from Sweden's powerful unions to Healey's thankless toil in UK Labour governments a decade before. As it happens, Feldt was a visitor to Labour's rumbustious 1980 party conference and witnessed the events that led to the breakaway of the Social Democrat 'gang of four'.</p>

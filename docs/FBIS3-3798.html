Liu made his remarks at the end of an 11-day Latin American  trip which took him to Venezuela, Chile and Argentina.    He said that Sino-Latin American relations are improving and  the number of high-ranking officials exchanging visits is  increasing.    Last year was a record year in bilateral trade, surpassing  3.7 billion U.S. dollars, the Chinese vice-minister said.    He noted that China and Latin American countries share  similar viewpoints on many international issues and support each  other in the United Nations and on the issue of human rights.    Therefore, Liu said, there is a solid foundation for further  cooperation between China and Latin America.</p>

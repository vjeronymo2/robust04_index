			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HANDYMAN Q &amp; A: HOME IMPROVEMENT;  </P> <P> BREAK UP THE SIDEWALK TO REMOVE TREE ROOTS  </P> <P> Q: A large tree near our house has caused the nearby sidewalk to crack. In one  place, the concrete has lifted several inches. Do I have to remove all the  concrete and how is it done? Also, how can I prevent the tree roots from  causing further damage. A friend says if I cut them it will kill the tree.  </P> <P> A: Use a cold chisel and a sledgehammer or other heavy hammer to break the  sidewalk into several pieces. They can be removed more easily than if the  concrete is left in one or two pieces. Cutting the roots with an ax will not  kill the tree. After the roots have been chopped so they no longer can extend  themselves, put down new concrete, using expansion joints if necessary. You can  use a concrete mix that needs only the addition of water, or mix your own from  sand, portland cement and aggregate.  </P> <P> Cut Hardboard Panels With a Special Blade  </P> <P> Q: I have several large panels of a synthetic wood with a kind of plastic  finish that looks like marble. I probably will use it on a project I have in  mind. The synthetic is very hard. I have a portable saber saw which I use  sometimes to cut plywood. If I use it on these panels, will it ruin the saw?  </P> <P> A: It sounds as though you have panels of hardboard. It is not synthetic, but  made from regular wood logs that are converted to chips and wood fibers and  bonded under heat and pressure. It can be cut with most saws but might not  yield easily to a saber saw unless you use a special blade. Since there are  some differences between standard hardboard and tempered hardboard, it would be  a good idea to take a sheet of the material to your local lumberyard and ask  what variety of hardboard it is and what saw blades can be used to cut it.  </P> <P> 'Flat Plate' Collector Draws Solar Energy  </P> <P> Q:. I hope to convert my house to solar energy. I constantly see the term "flat  plate collector." I know what a solar collector is but the words "flat plate"  mean nothing to me. Can you help?  </P> <P> A: A flat plate collector generally consists of an absorbing plate, often  metallic and painted black to increase absorption of the sun's heat. It is  insulated on the back and covered with a transparent cover sheet to trap heat  within the collector. There are many variations of flat plate collectors. You  will find out more about them when you are ready to have a conversion made.  </P> <P> Compression Faucets Are Older, Use Washers  </P> <P> Q: I have read a chapter in a booklet telling how to repair what is called a  compression faucet. How do I know whether my faucet is that type?  </P> <P> A: In a compression faucet, a threaded spindle is turned and the washer at the  end of the lower end is pressed against a valve seat. This shuts off the supply  of water. Modern faucets do not use washers. If your faucet has one, it is of  the compression-type. Despite the big inroads into the market of washerless  faucets, the majority of houses still have compression faucets simply because  they are old.MDO Plywood Is Best for Exterior Projects  </P> <P> Q: Soon I will be using plywood in an exterior project. It is important that  the paint job be extra smooth. Which kind of plywood should I get?  </P> <P> A: Not all lumberyards have it, but it can be ordered. It is a type of plywood  called MDO. Those letters stand for Medium Density Overlay. The face of this  kind of plywood is treated so that it will take an exceptionally smooth painted  finish.  </P> <P> Louvered Patio Roof Will Filter Sunlight  </P> <P> Q: I intend to put a roof on our patio. I will be using 4-by-4 wooden posts,  4-by-6 beams and 2-by-6 joists. I would like a roof that filters the sunlight,  using 1-by-4s for the louvers. How far apart should they be to allow some  sunlight to come through, yet not enough to make it too warm on a hot day.  </P> <P> A:. Spaces of three inches between the wood should be just right to accomplish  your purpose. The louvers should be placed on edge and toenailed to the joists.  </P></p>

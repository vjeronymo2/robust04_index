			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Refurbishment adds to Arnotts decline Arnotts, the Dublin-based stores group, saw its pre-tax profit decline by 16 per cent to IPounds 1.01m, or Pounds 952,000, in the half year ended July 31. The result, down from IPounds 1.21m, followed more difficult trading conditions exacerbated by renovations at the Henry Street store in Dublin. The work disrupted business and contributed to a reduction in margins. It should be completed by the end of October. Turnover for the period was marginally ahead at IPounds 19.7m (IPounds 19.2m). Earnings per share fell to 3.5p (4.1p) but the interim dividend is again 2.25p.</p>

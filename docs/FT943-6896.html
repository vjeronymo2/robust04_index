			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Enzyme clue to ageing Scientists working for the Medical Research Council in Cambridge have identified the structure of an enzyme that plays a leading role in the conversion of energy within cells. The structure of the enzyme, known as F-ATPase, is described in this week's Nature, the scientific journal. The researchers, at the MRC's Laboratory of Molecular Biology, believe that knowledge of the detailed structure of F-ATPase and the other enzyme complexes involved in energy conversion will aid understanding of the ageing process, together with neurodegenerative and neuromuscular diseases. The enzyme, which is about 200,000 times smaller than a pinhead, is the biggest high-resolution asymmetrical biological structure yet determined by X-ray crystallography. The structure shows the positions of almost 3,000 amino acids on the enzyme. Medical Research Council: UK, tel 071 636 5422; fax 071 436 2665</p>

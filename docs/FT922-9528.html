			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Survey of Switzerland (11): A neutral force - Is the army that absurd? ONE NEVER knows whether to treat the subject of the Swiss army with humour or respect. The idea of a small, resolutely neutral, land-locked country of 6.8m people having a huge citizen army constantly at the ready to repel any invader and enough nuclear shelters to house every citizen somehow seems absurd. Yet historically, Swiss military achievements, up to and including the second world war, speak eloquently for the competence and courage of the country's armed forces and for the durability of the country's neutrality and democratic institutions. And the Swiss militia system, under which every able-bodied male is constantly on call and has to train for a few weeks every year, has long been admired for its contribution to the country's social fabric as well as to its military effectiveness. The system has even been copied, notably by Israel. And yet, and yet. The cold war is over and the prospect of nuclear conflagration on the European continent seems to have disappeared. Even before the fall of the Berlin wall, Switzerland's military stance had been questioned. After all, the military was still working under a security doctrine published in 1966. Did the country still need a 600,000-strong army? Did every strategic bridge and tunnel in the country still have to have vast quantities of high explosives strapped to it? Some even doubted that the country needed an army at all. In 1989, a referendum on the subject revealed that a startling 35.6 per cent minority favoured scrapping it. Perhaps that galvanised the federal government into action. In the spring of 1989, Bern launched a full-scale re-evaluation of the country's future military requirements, called Army 95. The result will be implemented towards the middle of the decade. The plan retains the principle of armed neutrality for Switzerland, claiming that an army contributes to the credibility of a country. It also accepts that Switzerland should continue to rely on an army composed almost entirely of part-timers. But it acknowledges that the potential missions of the military concerns about maintaining order at home in the event of natural catastrophes or shock waves from conflicts or disasters in neighbouring countries. 'The line between simple violence and warlike actions is a very moving one, notably when the development of a situation has not been understood quickly and responded to energetically,' the draft says. As a result, Switzerland needs a smaller, more flexible army. Troop numbers could fall by a third to 400,000 and the class system, dividing soldiers among elite, support and stormtroop cadres, should be eliminated. Time given over to military service could be substantially shortened. Now the minimum service consists of a 17-week basic training course at age 20 plus a further 12 sessions totalling 212 days taken up to the age of 50. Under Army 95, it would be reduced to an initial 15 weeks and only 10 additional sessions of 19 days, taken every two years up to the age of 42. There has been little public reaction to the Army 95 proposals, which would suggest that most Swiss are comfortable with them. Many men in their 40s are pleased because they are at points in their careers where the time given over to the military can be a real loss. Similarly, young people now envisage the possibility of doing some kind of civil service instead of joining the army. Up to now, this has been forbidden, but a referendum on a proposal to introduce it is being held next week. In March, a consultation process on creating a battalion of 600 armed 'blue helmet' forces to help in United Nations peacekeeping operations has also yielded positive results. Up to now, the country has supplied only unarmed 'blue beret' peacekeepers, but the political parties are agreed that the country must do more in the future. All this is not to say there has been no controversy on the military front. The country was gripped last month by a surge in opposition to the government's plan to invest Dollars 2.3bn in 34 McDonnell Douglas F-18 fighter aircraft to replace ageing Mirages. The plan was approved by one of the two parliamentary chambers in March and now requires only approval from the other in June to be put into effect. The pacifist Group for an Army Free Switzerland has launched a petition that would cancel the project, and hopes to raise the 100,000 required signatures before the June vote. The drive just might succeed. Many Swiss who are not pacifist still do not understand the need for a sophisticated fighter aircraft to face the kind of adversaries posited in Army 95. Another issue is the future of Swiss neutrality. In March, a group of experts submitted a report to the government, saying that the country's tradition of neutrality did not prevent it from joining the European Community or participating in UN mandated economic sanctions. EC entry would not conflict with Swiss neutrality as long as the EC did not have security and defence policy structures fixed by treaty. If the EC subsequently set up a military alliance, the Swiss might have to reassess their policy of neutrality but, 'even as a member of the EC, Switzerland could stand aside during conflicts between other states, maintain a credible and autonomous national defence and carry out its traditional humanitarian and mediating roles'. The foreign ministry is now assessing the report and may recommend policy changes to the cabinet.</p>

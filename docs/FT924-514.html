			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Yeltsin wins cabinet posts for his chief reformers: Radical deputy PM to take over finance and economy MR Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, yesterday emerged from three days of tough bargaining having secured a cabinet of all the main reformers he wanted, plus a new radical deputy prime minister in charge of finance and the economy. This marks a decisive victory for the reformers in protracted behind-the-scenes negotiations between the president and Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the new prime minister. Mr Boris Feodorov, Russia's executive director at the World Bank and a former Russian finance minister, joins Mr Anatoly Chubais (in charge of privatisation) and Mr Alexander Shokhin (in charge of foreign economic relations) in the ranks of deputy prime ministers. Mr Chernomyrdin said the composition of the cabinet had not changed drastically, and it would continue reform but take into account social considerations, Itar-Tass news agency reported. Also on the cabinet list, signed by Mr Yeltsin last night, is Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the embattled foreign minister. Mr Kozyrev, together with the ministers of defence, interior and security - also confirmed in their posts  -must now submit himself to approval by parliament. The liberal Mr Kozyrev, who has always been next after Mr Yegor Gaidar, the former acting prime minister, in the conservative and centrist deputies' firing line, is thought unlikely to get it. However, Mr Sergei Shakhrai, the former legal adviser to Mr Yeltsin - and another deputy prime minister remaining in place - said yesterday Mr Yeltsin could himself confirm Mr Kozyrev as foreign minister, at least for a further three months. Mr Vladimir Shumeiko stays on as first deputy prime minister, and Mr Andrei Nechayev, the economics minister, also retains his post - meaning that the economics team appointed by Mr Gaidar is all but untouched. The one casualty, Mr Pyotr Aven, the trade minister, who resigned on Monday, is replaced by Mr Sergei Glazyev, his former deputy. The one concession to the conservative deputies, who won the resignation last week of Mr Gaidar during the Congress of People's Deputies' session, was in the appointment as a deputy premier of Mr Yuri Yarov, a deputy chairman of parliament. Mr Yarov has been a supporter of Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, but has kept links with Mr Yeltsin's camp and has been less fiercely opposed to the reform government than Mr Khasbulatov. Mr Yarov appears to replace Mr Georgi Makharadze, a deputy prime minister in charge of regional affairs. Mr Feodorov's appointment, for which Mr Chubais and Mr Shokhin fought hard in the past three days, is seen as a crucial one for maintaining the fight against inflation and strengthening privatisation. Anthony Robinson, Eastern Europe editor, adds: Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet Union's last unelected communist president, last night denounced his old rival Mr Yeltsin, Russia's first popularly elected president, as a neo-Stalinist. Speaking in an interview with the BBC's Newsnight, Mr Gorbachev, who resigned as Soviet president on Christmas Day last year, also said Mr Gaidar had prepared his own downfall with what he called 'cynical policies which had made people poor'. He added it would be 'completely wrong' to imagine the reforms could only continue under Mr Gaidar, whose reforms he said had brought chaos.</p>

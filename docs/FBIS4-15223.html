			<p>BFN     [Text] On night of April 7 Vladimir Kazimirov, special  representative of the Russian president and Ambassador at large,  who is a mediator in the settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijani  conflict, met with President Heydar Aliyev in Baku. The meeting  was held behind closed doors. There is no information about the  details of this meeting.    On the eve of the meeting Kazimirov reported in his  interview  with journalists that the major goal of his present visit to  Baku is the clarification of the position of the Azerbaijani  party to the renewed variant of the Russian plan aimed at the  political settlement of the Karabakh conflict.    The Russian plan, in particular, provides for a cease-fire  and cessation of hostilities to be followed by withdrawal of the  troops from the territories occupied in the course of  hostilities, restoration of communications, return of refugees  to their permanent place of residence, and, at the third stage,  political negotiations on the legal status of Nagorno-Karabakh.</p>

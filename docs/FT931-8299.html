			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Senior bourses anticipate German M3 data THE BUNDESBANK did not move on interest rates yesterday but bourses rose, partly on spreading optimism for modest German M3 growth for January, writes Our Markets Staff. As dealers said that hopes of further interest rate cuts were based on expectations of M3 landing within the Bundesbank's target range, the president of the Munich-based Ifo economic research institute was saying that Buba should make further cuts to encourage more capital investment. Meanwhile, bond yields were dropping in Frankfurt and Paris, and nudging their equities higher. FRANKFURT registered a seven-month high as the DAX index rose 19.00 to 1,672.26, its highest close since July 17, just after a Bundesbank rise in the German discount rate took European equities into decline. Turnover improved from DM6.1bn to DM6.5bn. Even though there had been no decrease in rates yesterday, Mr Edgar Benischeck at Bank Julius Bar in Frankfurt said that investors were aware that the Bundesbank had taken two small steps on the downward path when, on precedent, it could be expected to take seven or eight. Even after an 8 per cent recovery this year, he added, the DAX was still 4 per cent down from its July 16 level, while the Bundesbank's average bond yield had fallen from 8.48 to 6.71 per cent, or by 177 basis points, in the interim. Finally, he said, the market was 12 months ahead of the economy, looking not to 1993 when the move to strong cost reductions will hit corporate profits, but to 1994 when some of the benefits will arise. The interest rate and cost reduction themes were reflected respectively in financials, where Deutsche Bank rose DM11.70 to DM682.70, and in carmakers where Volkswagen recovered DM6.80 to DM287.40 after its fall on last Friday's DB Research downgrade. PARIS stayed with the interest rate theme as many investors clung to the belief that European rates are due to ease in the short-term. The CAC-40 index, which dipped briefly after the Bundesbank left the Lombard rate unchanged, closed off the day's high of 1,932, but still 21.55 ahead at 1,926.52. Apart from financial and bank stocks, stronger on rate cut hopes, high turnover was noted in Bon Marche, up FFr45 or 8 per cent at FFr554, with speculation that there might be a restructuring of companies in Mr Bernard Arnault's group. Chargeurs gained FFr58 to FFr1,378 after confirming reports that it may buy a 20 per cent stake in the satellite division of Canal Plus, FFr17 firmer at FFr1,238. Rhone-Poulenc continued to advance ahead of its inclusion in the CAC on Monday and its good earnings announcement on Wednesday. The shares rose FFr17 to FFr565. MILAN stayed firmly in the grip of 'Fiat fever' as shares in the car group advanced another 9 per cent, fixing at L5,400. Most analysts believe that demand for the stock has come about partly because of its relative cheapness prior to its gains at the end of last week, and through foreign institutions, underweight in Italy, looking to enter the market. Speculation that Fiat might be planning a rights issue with warrants has also fuelled demand, according to other analysts. The Comit index rose 7.96 to 506.49. Olivetti gained L65 to L2,095 while, among the banks, Mediobanca was L555 firmer at L14,705. ZURICH followed the general trend, helped by easier Swiss interest rates, banks were strong and volume was described as fairly good as the SMI index rose 19.0 to 2,131.9. Union Bank saw heavy volume as it rose SFr9 to SFr936, SBC added SFr7 to SFr342 and CS Holding SFr30 to SFr2,150. STOCKHOLM saw S-E Banken decline after announcing that it expects to see further loan losses in 1993-94. The C shares lost SKr2 to SKr12 but the rest of the market was generally firmer with the Affarsvarlden General index advancing 10.9 to 984.9 in turnover of SKr1.1bn. Ericsson and Astra both recovered Wednesday's losses, with respective rises of SKr13 and SKr8 to SKr716 and SKr222. OSLO was helped to a higher close by Kvaerner which, up SKr2.50 at SKr163, said that it expected stronger earnings in 1993. The all-share index improved 1.58 to 398.74 in turnover of NKr512.2m. Norsk Hydro, which releases 1992 results on Monday, gained NKr2.00 to NKr162.50. AMSTERDAM firmed with chemical stocks and major blue chips giving good performances. The CBS Tendency index advanced 1.3 to 99.0.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- February 18                                         THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             Open      10.30       11.00      12.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1128.63    1130.67     1129.69    1130.83 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1179.74    1180.63     1181.84    1180.49  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            13.00      14.00       15.00      Close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1132.19    1133.24     1133.42    1132.95 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1186.13    1185.86     1188.48    1191.03  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Feb 17    Feb 16    Feb 15    Feb 12    Feb 11  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1121.77   1123.14   1132.97   1129.97   1126.71 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1173.51   1179.54   1184.15   1181.05   1175.45  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1135.45; 200 - 1193.30 Low/day: 100 - 1128.51  200 - 1179.61.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

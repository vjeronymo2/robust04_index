L. 103&hyph;182, 107 Stat. 2057 (December 8, 1993) (``NAFTA Implementation Act''). In particular, these interim regulations implement title III of the NAFTA Implementation Act, which provides for special safeguard investigations and determinations with respect to Canadian and Mexican articles during the transition period for tariff elimination under the North American Free Trade Agreement (``NAFTA''), provide for certain findings with respect to Canadian and Mexican articles in the course of an investigation under section 202 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2252), make certain conforming changes to section 202 of the Trade Act of 1974 with respect to treatment of confidential business information, and direct the Commission to ``adopt such procedures and rules and regulations as are necessary to bring its procedures into conformity with chapter 8 of the Agreement.'' These interim regulations also implement title IV of the NAFTA Implementation Act, which provides for issuance of administrative protective orders for information required to be released in review by a binational panel of United States antidumping and countervailing duty final determinations involving products from Canada or Mexico. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  These amended interim rules take effect as of January 1, 1994, the date on which the NAFTA became effective.

Part 206  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Chapter 8 of the NAFTA sets out the procedures and remedies available to domestic industries that have sustained, or are threatened by, serious economic injury due to increased imports. Chapter 8 covers two different situations_actions that can be taken against increased imports from a single NAFTA country due to injury caused by the phase-out of tariffs under the NAFTA (``bilateral'' actions) and those that can be taken against imports from all sources (``global'' actions). In general, such bilateral actions may be taken during specified ``transition periods'' during which duties on NAFTA-origin goods are being phased out. When taking global actions, NAFTA countries are called upon to exclude goods originating in other NAFTA countries from the action when they are not a significant cause of the problem. However, NAFTA imports initially excluded may be subsequently included if a surge in such imports is found to undermine the effectiveness of the relief action. In several respects, the chapter tracks the emergency action provisions in Chapter 11 of the United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement (``CFTA'') for both bilateral and global actions, while adding Mexico to, and making certain changes in, the CFTA rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chapter 8 of the NAFTA goes beyond Chapter 11 of the CFTA in several respects. The chapter establishes procedural rules similar to those in current U.S. law and practice that each government will be required to follow in conducting investigations leading to bilateral and global safeguard actions against goods from other NAFTA countries. These rules require, among other things, the publication of notice of an investigation and its scope, the holding of a public hearing, protection of confidential information, and publication of findings and the basis for those findings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title III of the NAFTA Implementation Act (1) provides for special safeguard investigations and determinations by the Commission with respect to Canadian and Mexican articles during the transition period of the Agreement; (2) provides for Commission findings in the context of a global action safeguard investigation under section 202 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2252) to assist the President in determining whether imports from Canada or Mexico should be excluded from the relief action; and (3), if imports from Canada and/or Mexico are excluded from the action, provides for Commission investigations and findings with respect to whether there has been a surge in such excluded imports which undermines the effectiveness of the relief action. Title III also makes certain conforming changes to section 202 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2252) with respect to treatment of confidential business information. Section 317 of the NAFTA Implementation Act directs the Commission to ``adopt such procedures and rules and regulations as are necessary to bring its procedures into conformity with chapter 8 of the Agreement.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since August 29, 1988, the Commission has had in effect interim rules governing the Commission's administrative responsibilities under sections 201&hyph;204 and 406 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2251&hyph;2254, 2436). See 53 FR 33036, Aug. 29, 1988. The amendments to these rules provide procedures for Commission investigations and determinations with respect to imports from Canada or Mexico during the transition period of the Agreement; for Commission findings in the context of a global action safeguard investigation under sections 201&hyph;202 of the Trade Act of 1974 to assist the President in determining whether imports from Canada or Mexico should be excluded from the relief action; and, if imports from Canada and/or Mexico are excluded from the action, for Commission investigations and findings with respect to whether there has been a surge in such excluded imports which undermines the effectiveness of the relief action. The amendments also set out Commission procedures regarding the protection of confidential business information, and make certain technical changes to bring the rules into conformity with chapter 8 of NAFTA. No changes except with respect to numbering were made to rules specifically relating to the Commission's administrative responsibilities under sections 204 and 406 of the Trade Act. These amended interim rules are intended to replace the existing rules as of January 1, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

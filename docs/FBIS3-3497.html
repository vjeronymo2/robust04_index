Real estate, manufacturing, commerce and tourism are the  mainstay industries of this special economic zone.    The issuing of joint stocks has effected a change in the  management mechanism of enterprises. The Minnan Trade Center,  for instance, raised 75 million yuan for its construction in  this way. Under the supervision of the shareholders, the project  was constructed one year ahead of time.    A construction and development company in Haicang, one of  the  four government-approved special areas for Taiwan investors,  joined with five financial institutions to raise 300 million  yuan for the construction of highways, harbors,  program-controlled telephones, water conduits and other items of  infrastructure.    The 6.1-km highway bridge connecting Xiamen Island and  Haicang area is also expected to be financed through the issuing  of stock.</p>

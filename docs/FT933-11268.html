			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Survey of Japan (7): In two minds about Bill - Michiyo Nakamoto finds mixed attitudes towards the US president IN A country where youth is still associated mostly with inexperience and naivete, the reaction to a young and earnest US President has been as schizophrenic as the relationship between the two countries in recent years. Many Japanese have warmed to President Bill Clinton's enthusiasm and his approachable style. Some have seen in his show of youthful determination a glimmer of hope for the renewal and revitalisation of the US. But at the same time, the Japanese public has been outraged by the tough demands made on their own government by the US under Mr Clinton. The Japanese popular view of Mr Clinton has been very much a direct result of the different approaches the US President has employed in his dealings with Japan. On his visit to Tokyo for the Group of Seven Summit meeting earlier this month, the US President went out of his way to take his message directly to the Japanese public, presumably with the hope of spreading some goodwill along the way. Mr Clinton gave the Japanese public a first-hand taste of his informal style when he addressed a group of students at Waseda University - a generation more likely to relate to his view of things, not to mention his style - and then ventured to chat with residents in the neighbourhood. The event went down well with the Japanese press which featured front-page photos of the US president meeting school children and waving to an amateur baseball team. However, Mr Clinton's easy-going ways have not altered his reputation in Japan as something of a bully, determined to wrest concessions from Japan on trade. US demands that Japan reduce its current account surplus from 3 per cent of GDP to between 2 and 1 per cent within three years and raise the ratio of imports to GDP by 30 per cent have been seen to be heavy-handed. Comments from US officials which led to the sharp rise of the yen have been interpreted as a sign that the Clinton administration would use whatever means it has available to reduce its trade deficit with Japan. A joint survey conducted last month by the television companies TBS in Japan and CBS in the US and The New York Times, found that 76 per cent of the Japanese respondents did not trust Clinton and 85 per cent believed the US was blaming Japan for its own economic problems. Politicians and bureaucrats have also expressed unhappiness with the way the relationship has gone under the new administration, but they have tended to blame the Clinton trade team's relative inexperience and the apparent lack of a clearly defined Japan policy for the increased friction. Taking a somewhat more philosophical approach, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, until recently Japan's Prime Minister, along with a host of political commentators and academics, have seen the tougher US stance on trade with Japan as an indication that the bilateral relationship has reached a turning point. The tougher stance of the Clinton administration towards Japan, according to this school of thinking, is a direct result of a shift in the world order in which the US can no longer be expected to play the role of the tolerant superpower. As such, it was more a sign of weakness than of strength on the part of the US and a development that requires Japan to play a more assertive role in the bilateral relationship. Mr Miyazawa explained on Japanese TV that Mr Clinton's predecessor, George Bush, who was shot down near the Japanese islands during World War Two, belonged to a generation of Americans that thought they were responsible for shaping post-war Japan and therefore took a more protective stance towards the country. MR CLINTON'S relationship with Japan is very different, the prime minister pointed out. Mr Clinton grew up in an America that watched TV on Japanese-made sets and drove Japanese cars. 'To him, Japan has always been an adult,' Mr Miyazawa said. Sensing that this new order calls for them to stand on their own feet, the Japanese authorities have taken a harder stance against US demands. Calls on Japan to set numerical benchmarks which would measure progress in opening up its markets to foreign goods, and in particular, to set a target for reducing its current account surplus, have been vigorously resisted on the grounds that such action would lead to managed trade. Unilateral action by the US, such as the recent ruling by the Commerce Department to impose anti-dumping duties on steel imports, have been met with counter-threats to take the issue to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Such resentment and frustration felt in Japan towards the Clinton administration's handling of trade friction with Japan runs a serious risk of further aggravating bilateral relations. If President Clinton's generation of Americans see Japan primarily as an economic power, a growing number of Japanese in positions of influence regard the US as 'a declining power that is blaming others for its own shortcomings,' says Mr Yoshio Terasawa, a former vice president of Nomura Securities who is now a member of the Japan New Party. Fortunately, spreading irritation with the US is still generally tempered by the view that much of what the US is demanding is either for the country's long-term good or is something that Japan needs to face up to sooner or later. Government bureaucrats, such as those at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry who jealously guard the interests of domestic industry, admit that Japan must try to open its markets more not because of US pressure but to bring its practices in line with rest of the world. Even the tabloid press has portrayed the US president as a friend of the Japanese consumer. The daily Gendai pointed out that the president's remark to the G7 - that Japan has the ability to further stimulate its economy - revealed to the Japanese public what the Japanese government had so far failed demonstrate - that it still has the financial means to invest in social infrastructure, lower taxes and generally improve the lot of the average consumer. The consensus so far in Japan is that these mixed feelings of resentment and goodwill are the natural outcome of a relationship that is moving increasingly towards a more equal partnership. As Foreign Minister Kabun Muto, who compares the relationship to that of two sumo wrestlers who are brothers, puts it, 'there's a feeling of rivalry. But they're still brothers.'</p>

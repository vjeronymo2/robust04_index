			<p>BFN     [Text] The last point in the program of the visit that  Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic made Bucharest was the  meeting of the two heads of state with representatives of the  mass media at Cotroceni Palace.    The two heads of state, Ion Iliescu and Slobodan Milosevic,  stressed the fact that this summit visit is a significant  political event in the traditional bilateral relations and a  constructive factor in promoting a favorable climate for the  establishment of stability in the area.    President Slobodan Milosevic expressed his particular  satisfaction with the results of the visit and said that the  viewpoints expressed on this occasion were quite close and they  proved a mutual understanding of bilateral and international  issues that are of great interest to both sides.    Likewise, the sides recalled the efforts made by the two  countries to support and stimulate the peace process in the area  of the former Yugoslavia.    President Ion Iliescu said that the only way to emerge from  the current situation of conflict is through peaceful political  means and not by resorting to the application of forceful  measures.    In turn, President Slobodan Milosevic positively stressed  the  role played by Romania in developing relations in the region,  commending the objective way in which our country approached the  current situation.    The sides recalled the efforts made by the two countries to  return to normal bilateral relations after the sanctions imposed  on Yugoslavia by the UN Security Council are lifted and the  conflict in the area is extinguished.    Answering a question asked by a journalist, the Serb  President categorically denied the involvement of regular Serb  troops in the conflict in Bosnia, however, he accused the  Muslims of an offensive against the Serbs in the area.  Referring to the recent establishment of the federation of  Croatians and Muslims in Bosnia, President Milosevic declared  that it is important that this federation should not harm the  interests of the Serb side, which is in no way engaged in its  operation.    At around 1900 the Yugoslav guest left for Belgrade.</p>

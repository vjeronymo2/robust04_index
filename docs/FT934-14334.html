			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Kuwaiti oil executive quits MR Abdulrazaq Mulla Hussein has resigned as deputy chairman of the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation, the group which owns the Gulf state's oil producing and refining interests, over what appear to be differences on management strategy with Mr Ali al-Baghli, the oil minister. News of Mr Hussein's resignation emerged in articles yesterday in two Kuwaiti dailies, and was confirmed by Kuwaitis close to the KPC. Onepaper quoted Mr al-Baghli as saying that 'there was a difference in the points of view about how to manage the oil sector'. Other Kuwaitis said these differences had been festering for months within KPC, where Mr al-Baghli's style had ruffled feathers among senior management. Mr al-Baghli, a Shia and lawyer by background, took over the Oil Ministry after last year's elections and is the first oil minister simultaneously to hold a seat in the National Assembly. Kuwaiti sources said that many within the state-owned KPC management had felt uneasy about the way that Mr al-Baghli combined what they viewed as a largely technocratic portfolio with his desire to sustain a high political profile. Managers, including Mr Hussein, are understood to have been particularly dismayed by several public criticisms by the minister of the group's strategy.</p>

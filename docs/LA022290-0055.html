			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PRIVATE DETENTION OF CRIMINALS STILL AN OPTION, JUDICIAL PANEL RULES  </P> <P> Despite law-enforcement officials' objections to private work-furlough jails,  San Diego judges will continue to consider placing criminals in the facilities  on a case-by-case basis, a local judicial panel has decided.  </P> <P> In a letter sent Tuesday to San Diego Dist. Atty. Edwin Miller Jr., Presiding  Superior Court Judge Judith McConnell said that local judges will continue to  use their discretion in deciding whether to place people convicted of a crime  in a normal county jail or in a private work-furlough facility.  </P> <P> Two weeks ago, Miller had written to local judges opposing the commitment of  any criminal defendants to private work-furlough facilities, which are seen by  supporters as a cost-effective way of alleviating the County Jail crowding.  Miller's letter stemmed from an opinion issued in January by Atty. Gen. John  Van de Kamp stating that assigning a person convicted of a crime to any private  jail operating without a county contract violates state penal codes.  </P> <P> Some local judges, however, have said they believe that Van de Kamp's opinion  leaves room for interpretation, a position apparent in McConnell's one-page  letter to Miller.  </P> <P> "After additional research and full discussion, we have determined the issue of  placement of a person convicted of a crime in a private work-furlough facility  must be decided by each judge on a case-by-case basis," McConnell wrote.  </P> <P> The judges' decision to retain private jails as a sentencing options was made  by the Superior Court judges' Executive Committee, a panel that reviews issues  relating to court operations.  </P> <P> Advocates insist that private work-furlough facilities, which inmates can leave  only to work and pay a daily fee, are suited for minor offenders, allowing the  county's scarce jail space to be taken up by the hard-core criminal population.  Based on county figures showing that it costs taxpayers $40 a day to house  inmates in county jails, the nearly 250 local private work-furlough beds could  save the county about $4 million annually, according to operators of the  private detention facilities.  </P> <P> But skeptics complain of inadequate supervision at some private facilities,  citing past reports of drug use and of guards showing favoritism toward  inmates. Some private facilities also occasionally failed to meet basic safety  and sanitation standards.  </P> <P> Spurred by those concerns, the state Board of Corrections asked the attorney  general's office to determine whether courts have the authority to direct  people convicted of crimes to a private facility that operates without a county  contract. In his opinion, Van de Kamp said the courts lack such authority.  </P> <P> County officials have resisted awarding contracts to private work-furlough  facilities on the grounds that such pacts would make the county liable for any  improprieties that occur.  </P> <P> Although Miller had not yet seen McConnell's letter Wednesday, district  attorney's spokesman Steve Casey said that Miller is disappointed with the  judges' decision "because he believes the attorney general's opinion is pretty  clear."  </P> <P> Some judges, however, have said that, although Van de Kamp's opinion appears to  rule out sending individuals to private work-furlough centers in cases with a  minimum mandatory period of custody, they believe that they can still choose to  use the private jails in instances in which a judge has the discretion of  either incarcerating or placing a defendant on probation.  </P> <P> "We don't see it that way and will continue to oppose committing (inmates)  there," Casey said. "But, as to the disposition of each case, the judges will  get to decide that. That's why they sit up higher than we do."  </P></p>

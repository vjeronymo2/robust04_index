			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Leading Article: A German role in world peace THE COLD war has ended, but the German navy is being asked to dip its toe into the warm - perhaps hot - waters of the Adriatic. The German parliament is being recalled from recess today to debate last week's decision by the centre-right coalition to send a destroyer and three reconnaissance aircraft to join allied warships monitoring the UN trade embargo of Serbia and Montenegro. The opposition Social Democrats have claimed that the move may infringe Germany's Basic Law. Some SPD leaders threaten to call in the constitutional court to try to block the action - a move which could help by resolving juridical uncertainties on the issue. Beyond the Bonn bickering lie central questions about united Germany's role in world affairs. Although putting up a solid contribution to Nato defence during 40 years of division, Germany has been firmly inscribed on the list of international non-combatants. Now that it has regained sovereignty, the country is struggling to find a consensus on the conditions for using the Bundeswehr for peace operations outside the Nato area. Today's debate marks a significant step towards establishing that consensus. By declaring a readiness to put its defence resources at the service of the international community, whether in the context of the United Nations, Nato or the Western European Union, Europe's strongest economic power has a duty to live up to its new responsibilities. During last year's war with Iraq, when Germany was heavily criticised for initial hesitancy in supporting the UN-led coalition, Chancellor Helmut Kohl said it was unacceptable for Germany permanently to absent itself from international efforts to secure peace. It is now time for Mr Kohl firmly to register that commitment, even though it may add to his political difficulties at home. Greater clarity on out-of-area Bundeswehr deployment would also iron out inconsistencies in Germany's post-unification foreign policies, which - above all over recognising Croatia last year - have sometimes been driven more by moral crusading than practical considerations. There is a need for Germany to frame its military role in the spirit of partnership. Ultimately, however, it will be up to the Germans to decide what sort of military power they want to be. If the international community still does not want a German policeman on permanent patrol in the world's trouble spots, then it may be a consolation that the German public, too, does not like the idea. Two-thirds of the German population, according to opinion polls, back the use of German troops as UN peace-keepers. But there are deep misgivings, expressed above all by the Social Democrats, about Mr Kohl's desire to change the 1949 constitution to permit further-reaching Bundeswehr participation, in actions backed, for instance, by the WEU. Since he needs a two-thirds Bundestag majority for a constitutional change, Mr Kohl must convince the SPD that his way is best. Commenting on the impasse over the outside use of the Bundeswehr, Mr Klaus Kinkel, Germany's new foreign minister, has recently termed his country an 'impotent dwarf'. An international framework is now available for the dwarf to put on a little muscle. Germany should be en-couraged to take advantage of the opportunity. And the rest of the world should welcome it.</p>

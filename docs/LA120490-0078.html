			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> GOVERNMENT WILL TRY TO SELL J.M. PETERS CO.;  </P> <P> THRIFTS: WITH THE TAKEOVER OF SAN JACINTO S&amp;L COMES THE BURDEN OF UNLOADING  THE BUILDER THAT SHRIVELED IN HOUSING MARKET'S DOWNTURN.  </P> <P> The federal government last week acquired another piece of flotsam from the  wreckage of the thrift industry: J.M. Peters Co. Inc., a local home builder  owned mostly by San Jacinto Savings &amp; Loan Assn.  </P> <P> Federal regulators seized San Jacinto on Friday, and on Monday the government  said it would probably try to sell the home builder, which San Jacinto put up  for sale more than a year ago.  </P> <P> An official from the federal Resolution Trust Corp. said the agency plans to  push a sale "more aggressively" than San Jacinto. The RTC, the agency  responsible for selling off insolvent S&amp;Ls, tries to trim busted thrifts of  all their subsidiary companies until they hold nothing but their local  depositors' money before selling them.  </P> <P> J.M. Peters, however, may be a tough sell. Like other local home builders, the  company has taken a buffeting this year as sales of the expensive new homes it  builds all but dried up. Peters has hundreds of unsold houses in its inventory  and recently stopped new construction.  </P> <P> Individual shareholders, who own 13% of the stock, aren't too happy either. The  stock has plummeted from a high of nearly $13 per share last year, when the  housing market was still decent. It closed Monday at $1.125 per share in  American Stock Exchange trading.  </P> <P> J.M. Peters is one of Southern California's largest home builders, with  operations from San Diego to Ventura County, and the only local home builder  that large that's also publicly held. The company, which rode the crest when  sales swelled in the boom year of 1988, specializes in single-family homes  costing from $350,000 to $500,000 that are purchased mostly by people trading  up to a larger home.  </P> <P> Most of the homes being sold these days, however, are relatively inexpensive --  for Southern California -- because it's mostly first-time buyers in the market.  </P> <P> But with a motivated seller like the federal government owning most of the  company, and with the price of its stock down around its ankles, J.M. Peters  might seem a good buy to someone willing to hold on until the housing market  improves.  </P> <P> The federal government may ask for as much as $5 a share, said Mark Matheson, a  Newport Beach analyst. That puts a value on the company of about $70 million  for the 14 million shares outstanding. However, the government may have to  settle for considerably less, Matheson says.  </P> <P> "With the stock down around $1 a share, they may be willing to settle for $3 or  $4 a share to get the company off their hands," he said. At $3 a share, the  company would bring $42 million. That's about twice what San Jacinto paid for  the company in 1985. (But that figure doesn't include the percentage of the  company's earnings paid to Chairman James M. Peters since 1985 as an incentive  for him to stay on, an amount which has run into the millions of dollars.)  </P> <P> One potential purchaser is Peters, who would like to re-acquire the company,  according to a spokesman.  </P> <P> That seems a possible scenario because, except for management, one  home-building company is much like another. And the chairman seems to be a big  part of the company's attraction, since the incentive agreement San Jacinto  gave Peters to stay on paid him as much as $6.3 million a few years ago, making  Peters one of the best-compensated executives of a public company in Orange  County that year.  </P> <P> The company might not be nearly as desirable unless the new owner could work  out an agreement to keep Peters and his management team at the helm. On the  other hand it may be easier to buy the company from the RTC than from San  Jacinto, once a Houston-based high flier that reportedly rejected as too low a  buyout offer of $12.50 a share, or about $175 million, a year ago.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Peters said Monday that the RTC is reviewing "proposed  modifications" to Peters' lines of credit with its parent company, San Jacinto.  Peters owed San Jacinto a whopping $200 million at the end of the last quarter,  or about half its total debt.  </P> <P> The company said in a statement that it is negotiating with its other lenders  for "loan modifications" but would not elaborate.  </P> <P> It also said former San Jacinto Chairman Lawrence Connell resigned from Peters'  board. There was no explanation, and Connell couldn't be reached.  </P> <P> The seizure of San Jacinto had been expected for some time. It failed to meet  all three federal tests for sufficient assets after several years of making  risky real estate loans.  </P> <P> San Jacinto was in turn owned by Southmark Corp., a Dallas real estate firm  that recently emerged from federal bankruptcy proceedings. Southmark, too, was  hit by the downturn in the Texas real estate market.  </P> <P> Then, this year, things went sour for J.M. Peters as well. In September it  reported its first quarterly loss since going public in 1987, a $451,000  deficit contrasted with a year-earlier profit of $3.5 million.  </P> <P> </P> <P> J.M.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Commander in Chief Fidel Castro Ruz has written  Colombian President Cesar Gaviria expressing Cuba's solidarity  and condolences following the natural disaster there at the  beginning of the week. This was announced by Foreign Ministry  spokesman Miguel Alfonso, who added that the letter also  expressed the Cuban Government's willingness to send doctors and  specialists to Colombia if needed.    Alfonso said the Foreign Ministry is pleased with recent  statements by the Latin American Economic System -- SELA -- and  the Nonaligned Movement [NAM] rejecting the 30-year-old U.S.  Government blockade of Cuba. Alfonso pointed out that SELA's 3  June decision marked the first time that this organization had  made a statement against the blockade. Alfonso explained that  the NAM statement was much stronger than on previous occasions  in that it specifically advocated the UN General Assembly  resolutions against the blockade.    Alfonso also mentioned the rallies several U.S.  organizations  held in Washington and other U.S. cities on 9 June in support of  the bill to lift the U.S. blockade which legislator Charles  Rangel presented before Congress and other U.S. political and  federal entities.</p>

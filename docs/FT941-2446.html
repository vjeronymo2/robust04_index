			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Arts: Sacks's The Man Who - Theatre The writings of the neurologist Oliver Sacks are among the most exciting of our time. Not only do Awakenings, A Leg to Stand On, The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat, and others feature some of the best-written case studies since Freud, they also trace new connections between body and mind, time and space, memory and present awareness, logical and instinctive thought. And their influence on the performing arts has been remarkable: Pinter's play A Kind of Alaska, the film of Awakenings, the Second Stride multi-media work New Tactics, Michael Nyman's opera The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat and more. Now the theatre director/producer Peter Brook has joined these ranks. His staging of The Man Who. . . (originally performed in France as L'Homme qui ..) has now embarked upon a 10-week British tour - starting at the Contact Theatre, Manchester, as part of Manchester City of Drama '94. The good news about Brook's production of The Man Who. . . , a brisk plunge into the case-studies of Sacks's book, is that its anecdotes are often fascinating in the way that they are in the book. The bad news is that anecdotes are all Brook has assembled. Neither has he turned The Man Who. . . into a work of art, nor has he tackled many of Sacks's more exceptional themes. What you see is a kind of Sacks collage. There is the man mistaking his wife for his hat; the man who has lost all sense of his own leg (he cries in terror: 'Why have they put an amputated leg in my bed?'); the man who, shaving only one side of his face, believes that he has shaved all; the man who thinks he is still a boy. Astounding data, and often moving. The atmosphere is generally cool, objective. The method is Brechtian, though not the force. Four of the five performers swap roles, becoming patients and doctors by turns; the fifth provides occasional accompaniment on the kamanicheh, an Asian stringed instrument. Live videos are sometimes used to record details of the patients' behaviour, sometimes to show the patients things about themselves they otherwise fail to observe. Brook does not attempt to re-create the individual characters described by Sacks. Indeed, his staging involves a little deconstruction - chopping case studies up into separate anecdotes, sometimes having one patient's story re-enacted by two actors, replacing Sacks's white Anglo-Saxon characters with African, Oriental, and French performers. Brook never attempts one of Sacks's most abiding and profound themes - the miraculously therapeutic effect of music. Music, indeed, is one of the most lightweight features of the play. From time to time the kamanicheh adds its affecting sound, but it is applied - like film music - only to heighten the emotional effect of a scene. Three of Brook's four speaking performers speak with French accents, which are in two cases so strong that they start to become charming in themselves, but distance us from what is being said. There is no scenery, only chairs, video screens and a few smaller props. And the fact that there is a minimum of acted characterisation is a pity, for it is so important to Sacks to show us the effect of neurological disorder upon individual character. The Man Who. . . is an array of interesting and touching information. But it is a far more clinical and narrow work than Sacks's book, and not just because it omits the philosophical and literary references which Sacks so loves. Sacks's work keeps marvelling at the complexity of the human mind and saying: 'What a piece of work is man.' Brook's work, more ironic and detached, just says: 'Curiouser and curiouser.' The UK tour of The Man Who. . . includes the Newcastle Playhouse (March 29-April 9), the Tramway, Glasgow (April 12-23), the Nottingham Playhouse (April 26-30), and the Royal National Theatre, London (May 4-21).</p>

			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Working Life: City air pollution breathes fresh life into drug sales - Health Although Japan has been successful in reducing its air pollution by half during the past 20 years thanks to rigorous curbs - nitrous oxide levels in Tokyo are 26 per cent lower than in London - the number of patients who suffer from hay fever and asthma has risen sharply in the past few years due to the increase in pollen which reacts with pollutants in the air. This has opened a whole new market for drugs companies, which offer various treatments and masks. Kowa, a pharmaceutical maker, says the mask market has grown into a Y2.4bn business in which more than 50 companies compete to sell their 'clean air' masks which use anti-germ and static filters. Levels of sulphur dioxides and nitrous oxides have fallen sharply, but incidents of chemical oxidant smog, created by a combination of air pollutants, strong sun rays and an increase in ozone, have doubled in five years. Elsewhere in the region, air pollution is at critical levels due to governments pressing for economic growth and high temperatures aggravating the problem. According to the World Health Organization, of the seven cities in the world with the worst air pollution, five are in Asia. Emission from vehicles is the largest cause of air pollution in most Asian cities, where fuels are among the dirtiest in the world with sulphur in diesel fuel and lead in gasoline. Pollution caused by industry and building heat are other sources in the colder climates, especially in China. In the Thai capital Bangkok, bus passengers and pedestrians often hold a clean handkerchief across mouth and nose. Air pollution is particularly dangerous in a country where so much of life is lived on the street. Throughout Bangkok, people eat at roadside noodle stalls; they not only breathe in lead from vehicle exhausts, they eat it. Recent studies suggest that air pollution causes hundreds of deaths in Bangkok each year. In 1990 more than 1m of the city's inhabitants were treated for respiratory problems linked to dirty air. Across the Pacific ocean, California has the toughest anti-air pollution regulations in the world. For 20 years all new cars have been fitted with catalytic converters while car owners need to obtain a 'smog certificate'. The restrictions have provoked complaints from industries, but have prompted innovative businessmen to create a market where companies' permits to emit pollution are traded. In London, the government issued smog warnings three times in July after ozone levels rose high enough to trigger asthma and other breathing difficulties among vulnerable groups. The Department of Environment asked people to use cars less. A DoE survey, during one of the ozone peaks, showed that few complied - only 10 per cent of motorists decided not to use their cars on at least one occasion when they would otherwise have done so, according to the survey.</p>

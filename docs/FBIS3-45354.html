			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Robert MacPherson] </F>   [Text] Hong Kong, Jan 17 (AFP) -- Governor Chris Patten on  Monday said China was flip-flopping on the issue of Hong Kong's  new airport, and pressed once again for talks to resume on  financing the mammoth project. Speaking to reporters, Patten  said he was "a little puzzled" by remarks last week by a senior  Chinese official that Beijing thinks Hong Kong should spend more  of its reserves on the 20.3 billion U.S. dollar Chek Lap Kok  project.    "Sometimes they say we shouldn't put more money into the  airport. Sometimes they say that we should. Sometimes they say  both things in the same paragraph," he said. The best solution,  he said, was for the airport committee of the Sino-British Joint  Liaison Group -- charged with hammering out the details of Hong  Kong's return to China in 1997 -- to meet as soon as possible.    "I'm very happy to try to resolve these matters sooner than  later in the airport committee. That's what the people of Hong  Kong would like to do, too," he said.    Patten spoke as his administration said it was pressing  ahead  with a request to the Legislative Council for 1.67 billion Hong  Kong dollars (216 million U.S.) to keep the project going for  another few months.    Site preparation is nearing completion, but contracts have  yet to be issued for the airport's futuristic terminal, as well  as for the runway and maintenance facilities.    In remarks Tuesday in Beijing, Lu Ping, director of the Hong  Kong and Macao Affairs Office, warned Hong Kong against going it  alone with Chek Lap Kok, one of the world's biggest public works  projects. He also said the thriving colony could "inject a  certain amount" into the project, given its bulging reserves  which he put at more than 100 billion dollars (12.9 billion  U.S.). Yet when the project was first announced in 1989, China  feared its mammoth scope would bankrupt Hong Kong.    Under a 1991 agreement intended to allay that concern,  Britain agreed to secure China's approval for debt financing for  Chek Lap Kok, which also includes new roads and bridges, a  commuter train line and seaport facilities. But negotiations on  financing arrangements soon fell victim to a shrill bilateral  row over Patten's efforts to reform Hong Kong's political system  ahead of 1997. Sino-British talks on political reform broke  down in November, prompting the governor to press ahead with the  changes unilaterally.    Speaking Monday, Secretary for the Treasury Donald Tsang  said  the government was dropping one of two options it put to  legislators last week to keep the project going, pending an  agreement with China. That option would have limited stop-gap  funding to a one-off grant of 377 million dollars (48.77 million  U.S.) to keep the Provisional Airport Authority (PAA), set up to  run the new airport, running for another year.    Instead, Tsang said, it would press for the second, 1.67  billion dollar option that comprises the letting out of three  upcoming contracts, plus the funding for the PAA.    "We believe that there is a clear view in the community that  we should press ahead with the airport project as speedily and  efficiently as we can, while continuing to seek agreement with  the Chinese side," Tsang said.</p>

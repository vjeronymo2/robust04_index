The first closing date for the offer is today. The bid is a technical one designed to give EIO more than 50, and less than 75 per cent of the trust. EIO needs a majority stake to comply with new European Community guidelines on capital ade quacy. But some institutions are unhappy that EIO is not paying a premium for control. The bid is for 93 per cent of formula asset value (in essence, the net asset value minus expenses). If EIO gains majority control of the trust, it will be able to equity account the assets and thus, in theory, will not mind if the trust falls to a discount. Minority shareholders will have no power to alter the situation. 'If EIO wins control, it won't have the same interest as the rest of the shareholders,' said Mr Jonathan Woolf, deputy chairman of British American Film Holdings. BAFH owns 2 per cent of the trust and will not be accepting the offer. 'I would be surprised if anyone did,' said Mr Woolf. Another major institutional holder has already rejected the bid.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 18 KYODO -- The powerful Federation of  Economic Organizations (Keidanren) called on the government on  Monday [18 April] to promote deregulation, including phased  abolition of the law regulating the opening of large-scale  retail stores.    The federation also sought an easing of regulations on rice  and liquor sales and railway fares.    The government maintains tight controls on licensing rice  retailers.    The federation expressed hope that its appeal will be  reflected in a deregulation program to be formulated by the  government by the end of fiscal 1994.    It said deregulation in the retail business will help narrow  the price gap between domestic and imported goods.    The federation said passenger and freight fares should be  decontrolled while the existing regulation on shipbuilding  should also be reviewed to allow newcomers to enter the coastal  shipping market.</p>

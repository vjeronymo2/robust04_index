			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Albania Continues To Suffer Economic Damage Due to the </F> Embargo on Former Yugoslavia" -- ATA headline]    [Text] Tirana, April 23 (ATA) -- Albanian Government's  observation of the embargo on former Yugoslavia has seriously  damaged the mineral industry in the northeastern zone of  Albania. The mine of Kam, Tropoje district, is mostly suffering  the consequences of the embargo. Its productive activity is  almost suspended.    Earlier, the mine exported chrome ore for the enriching  factory of "Deva" of Gjakove in Kosova. Due to the application  of the embargo for 1992-1993 alone, about 60,000 tons of mineral  were not exported causing an economic damage of about 2.7  million dollars. Three productive sectors have been closed and  about 250 workers are on assistance. Annual production has  dropped about 17,000 tons from 60,000 tons it was earlier. So  far, the respective structures of the United Nations  Organisation have not done anything to compensate the damage  caused by the implementation of the embargo on former Yugoslavia.</p>

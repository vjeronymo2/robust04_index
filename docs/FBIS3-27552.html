			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Huanli (1728 3562 0448)] </F>   [Text] Tokyo, 24 Feb (XINHUA) -- Japanese Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa had a meeting with Chinese Vice Premier Zhu  Rongji at the former's official residence this afternoon .    Hosokawa warmly welcomed Zhu Rongji in the latter's visit to  Japan.    Zhu Rongji conveyed to Hosokawa the best regards of  President  Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng. Hosokawa expressed his thanks  for this and asked Zhu Rongji to convey his best regards to  President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng.    Zhu Rongji said to the prime minister: "You have attached  great importance to the development of Sino-Japanese relations  since you assumed office. We appreciate your efforts.  President Jiang and you had a very fruitful meeting in Seattle  last November. The common views shared by the two sides are  important for promoting the development of the two countries'  relations."    Hosokawa said: "President Jiang Zemin and I indeed had very  successful talks in Seattle. I myself am looking forward to  visiting China in mid- or late March to further promote the  development of Japanese-Chinese relations."    Zhu Rongji said: "We are actively making preparations for  your visit. You will be accorded a grand reception. Both  President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng are looking forward to  meeting you in Beijing in mid- or late March."    Hosokawa said: "The Japanese Government is pleased to see  the very rapid development of Japanese-Chinese economic  relations and trade. Japanese-Chinese friendship is extremely  significant. Not only is it in the interest of the two  countries, but it also will benefit the Asia-Pacific region and  the world as a whole. China's economy is full of vitality, and  it is developing very fast. The development of Japanese-Chinese  relations plays an important role in expediting Japan's economic  recovery. During Deputy Prime Minister Hata's recent visit to  China, our two countries reached a consensus of views on the way  that the fourth yen loan should be extended. I evaluated the  success highly."    Zhu Rongji agreed with Hosokawa's observation. He said:  Sino-Japanese joint ventures have played a major role in the  rapid development of Sino-Japanese economic relations and trade.  The goods produced by joint ventures, instead of competing with  Japanese goods, will enhance Japanese-made goods' competitive  and exploratory capabilities in the world market.    Zhu Rongji said: "Ever since China embarked on the reform to  build a market economy, the investment environment in China has  improved significantly, and this is good for Japanese  enterprises' investing in China and developing bilateral  economic cooperation and trade. It is hoped that Japan will  continue to render its support in this field. The deepening of  the mutually beneficial and interdependent economic cooperation  and trade between China and Japan will enhance the two  countries' prosperity and will help promote peace, stability,  and the development of the Asia-Pacific region and the world as  a whole."    Present at the meeting were He Chunlin, State Council deputy  secretary general, and other principal members of Zhu Rongji's  entourage, as well as Chinese Ambassador to Japan Xu Dunxin.</p>

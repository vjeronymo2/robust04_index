			<p><P> June 19, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SECRECY OF NEIL BUSH PROBE DECRIED;  </P> <P> 'LIFT VEIL' ON QUERY INTO S&amp;L FAILURE, CONGRESSMAN URGES  </P> <P> A House Banking Committee member called on federal regulators today to "lift  the veil of secrecy" surrounding their investigation of President Bush's son,  Neil, in connection with a Colorado thrift collapse.  </P> <P> "If it has brought charges against Neil Bush, it should make those charges  public," Rep. Frank Annunzio (D-Ill.) said, referring to the federal Office of  Thrift Supervision. "No law or regulation prevents the agency from revealing  the charges."  </P> <P> Neil Bush denied any wrongdoing in the collapse of Silverado Banking, Savings  &amp; Loan Assn. of Denver. He appeared May 23 before the committee, which was  probing whether his business interests in Colorado conflicted with his role as  a director of Silverado. He called allegations of conflict of interest  "frivolous."  </P> <P> "I'm calling on the Office of Thrift Supervision to lift the veil of secrecy  which shrouds this matter," Annunzio said at the outset of the latest hearing  on the Silverado failure.  </P> <P> Annunzio cited an undated and unsigned internal Office of Thrift Supervision  document that he said contained proposed charges against Neil Bush. But he said  no charges were ever brought nor has there been any indication of whether any  charges will be forthcoming from the government.  </P> <P> "The last time I checked, Neil Bush's father was the head of that  organization," Annunzio said.  </P> <P> "Can any agency of the United States fairly and impartially investigate the son  of the President of the United States?" he asked.  </P> <P> Rep. Stan Parris (R-Va.) defended Neil Bush, noting that he has declared his  innocence and citing a May 22 statement by federal regulators that they could  find no basis for issuing a prohibition on his further involvement in the  banking industry.  </P> <P> Parris said the document cited by Annunzio "is undated. It's unsigned. It was  never circulated. It is in fact, a draft. . . . Mr. Bush appeared here  voluntarily . . . for eight hours. . . . He believes he is innocent of any  wrongdoing.  </P> <P> "I think . . . it raises the question: Is Neil Bush paying a penalty because of  who he is, not being given some kind of unique benefits because of who he may  be?"  </P> <P> One focus of the hearings is the length of time it took regulators to close the  thrift after problems developed. The thrift was closed in late 1988, two years  after trouble surfaced.  </P> <P> "Nothing has been more costly than regulatory hesitation through the entire  savings and loan crisis," committee Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.) said in  an opening statement.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the White House blasted Democrats for the S &amp; L crisis.  </P> <P> "A big part of the problem here is that in the dead of night a few years ago,  the Democrats pushed through a bill raising the limits (of coverage for insured  deposits) to $100,000 a person," said White House Press Secretary Marlin  Fitzwater. The increase was part of a broader, bipartisan bill to overhaul the  entire S &amp; L industry.  </P> <P> "I'm saying the Democrats have a big role in it," he said.  </P></p>

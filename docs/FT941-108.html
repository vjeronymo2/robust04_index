			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: UK gilts It is tempting to assume that yesterday's gilts market rally owed something to the success of the first floating-rate issue since the 1970s. But cover of nearly 2.3 times is only what might be expected of an issue targeted towards banks which are short of borrowers. Having got one issue successfully away, the authorities can - within limits - issue more floating-rate paper, which may help reduce supply worries in the fixed-rate market. Otherwise gilts are still caught up in the ebb and flow of international confidence. It will take more than yesterday's two point gain to bring buyers out in force, though. Uncertainty over future funding remains great. A further floating-rate issue would be the obvious solution if the market remains nervous into April, but the authorities cannot become solely dependent on this instrument without being accused of fomenting inflation by selling too much paper into the banking system. As long as the Bank of England believes in its ability to control inflation and therefore to keep interest rates low, it can argue that floating-rate borrowing is cheap. Yet to shy away from fixed-rate funding because long yields are close to 8 per cent may be to miss the point. The Bank increasingly appears to have missed the opportunity to raise long-term funds when yields were at their trough. The floating alternative may still be revealed as an expensive option when the paper has to be refinanced in five years' time.</p>

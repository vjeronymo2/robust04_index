			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / Smith to seek overhaul of 'creaking constitution' MR JOHN SMITH, opposition leader, is to urge a new relationship between government and citizens as part of a Labour policy on what he calls Britain's 'creaking constitution'. In a speech to be made either before Christmas or in the new year he will address what he sees as growing public disenchantment with the 'elective dictatorship' and with what is seen as arrogance from ministers in their exercise of power. Mr Smith believes the handling of the pit closures was just one recent example among many of disquiet among voters at the lack of consultation between governors and governed. Another was the so-called Iraqgate disclosures over the sales of machinery with military end-uses to Iraq. Labour is already committed to a freedom of information act, a bill of rights and reform of the House of Lords. Mr Smith is expected to add new proposals on increasing the accountability of politicians to the public and parliament. These could include new powers for Commons committees to inquire into the actions of government departments and measures to apply the European Community's subsidiarity principle to the devolution of powers from Whitehall to the regions. The Maastricht treaty was 'the best deal on offer', Mr Jack Cunningham, the shadow foreign secretary, said yesterday. But he refused to pledge Labour's support for the third reading of the Bill to ratify the treaty. Leftwing Labour MPs are showing unease at the party leadership's European policy. They argue in a paper published by the 100-strong Tribune group that Labour should support a federal Europe and take a much more active role in pushing for a more democratically accountable EC.</p>

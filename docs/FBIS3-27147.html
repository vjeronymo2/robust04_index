			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn, February 20 (XINHUA) -- Bosnian Muslim and  Croatian leaders ended their peace talks tonight in Frankfurt  with no substantial result achieved.    However, Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic and Croatian  Foreign Minister Mate Granic told the press after the meeting  that the two sides had become much closer in their positions.    They described the negotiations as "very positive" although  problems still exist.    They also said they were more confident of finding a  solution  to their conflict.    Both sides agreed to continue their talks next week.    The two sides told the press that today's meeting was about  the future constitution of Bosnia, cease-fire between Croatians  and Muslims and humanitarian issues.    But neither Granic nor Silajdzic disclosed the details of  their talks.    However, Croatian Embassy Spokesman Zarko Plevnik said  before  the meeting that one topic would be a new map dividing Bosnia  between Croats, Muslims and Serbs.    According to Granic, the two sides will first hold meetings  at experts' level in the Croatian capital of Zagreb and then  summit talks.    Silajdzic expressed the hope that the negotiations would be  resumed after three or four days.</p>

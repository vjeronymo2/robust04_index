			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ELLA FITZGERALD HASN'T RUN OUT OF SURPRISES  </P> <P> At age 72, singer Ella Fitzgerald says she still enjoys performing because she  has something to offer.  </P> <P> "I like to feel like I can give people something they know and want and maybe  something that's new to them," Fitzgerald said in a telephone interview from  her home last week.  </P> <P> When she performs, the "first lady of song" gives more than a simple musical  retrospective of five decades on stage. She also surprises.  </P> <P> "I even did a rap in a concert in Washington," she said. "I was just messing  around, and they seemed to like it. Sometimes people will ask for a song, and I  try to do it."  </P> <P> "You'd be surprised how many young ones there are there," she says of her  concerts. "They tell me their parents have my records and that's how they  learned."  </P> <P> She still loves adoring fans at sold-out concert halls.  </P> <P> "That's what you thrive on. Sometimes when I'm out, I'll sing to children, and  their mothers will say, 'Oh my gosh! She's listening to you,' " Fitzgerald  said.  </P> <P> "Sometimes the tour buses stop and people wave, and if they catch me outside, I  take pictures with them. I love that. If people take the time and want to meet  you, I think's it wonderful."  </P></p>

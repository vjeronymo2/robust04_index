			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / International Company News: Production chief steps up to chairmanship of BMW BMW, the current star of the German motor industry, has replaced its retiring chairman with the youngest member of the board. Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder, 45, currently responsible for production, will take control at the luxury car group's annual meeting on May 13. At the same time, Mr Eberhard von Kuenheim, 64, the outgoing chairman, will propose an unchanged dividend of DM12.50 on ordinary stock and DM13.50 for preference shares. Bolstered mainly by the launch of the new 3-Series, and outselling rival Mercedes-Benz for the first time, BMW managed to ride through the worst of the downturn which cut Volkswagen's earnings by 87 per cent last year. Even so, net group profits shrank to DM726m (Dollars 436m) compared with DM783m, on sales up almost 5 per cent to DM31.2bn. The figures reflect the sharp downturn in the domestic market which hit all German automotive groups in the second half of the year. At the halfway mark BMW's earnings were up 10.5 per cent and turnover had risen 12 per cent. Mr von Kuenheim said in January that unit sales would fall during 1993. The appointment of a young engineer to the top post reflects both BMW's self-confidence in the face of recession and a noticeable trend across the industry towards handing power to the younger generation. Mr Pischetsrieder's place on the board will be filled by Mr Joachim Milberg, 49, an engineering academic whose industrial experience includes a spell at Gildemeister, the machine tool manufacturer. Mr von Kuenheim is expected to take over as chairman of the group's supervisory board.</p>

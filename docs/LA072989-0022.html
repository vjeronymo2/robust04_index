			<p><P> July 29, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOYCOTTING TV SHOWS  </P> <P> I've found the most obscene TV shows have been produced by the likes of Jim and  Tammy Faye Bakker, Oral Roberts and Jimmy Swaggart. "Knots Landing" can't even  compare to the avarice and greed, stories of illicit sex and homosexuality,  air-conditioned doghouses, fraud, deception, tearful confessions on TV that  these hypocrites have engaged in.  </P> <P> At least when I watch "Midnight Caller" I know I won't be harangued by someone  who wants me to send them my money.  </P> <P> RICHARD A.

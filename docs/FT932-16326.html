			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / International Company News: Largest Coke bottler to buy Dutch operations COCA-COLA Enterprises, the largest bottler of Coke and 44 per cent-owed by Coca-Cola itself, yesterday announced three acquisitions for a total of Dollars 360m. The moves will further consolidate bottling operations for the Atlanta-based soft drinks company. One of the businesses being acquired by CCE is Coca-Cola Beverages Nederland, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Coca-Cola, and the bottler of its products in the Netherlands. This purchase take CCE's interests outside the US for the first time. In 1992, CCB Nederland sold the equivalent of about 82m unit cases, producing revenues of some Dollars 320m. It accounts for about 40 per cent of fizzy soft drink volume in the Netherlands. CCE, despite the substantial Coca-Cola stake, is a public company and quoted separately on the New York Stock Exchange. It expanded significantly when it merged with Johnston Coca-Cola in 1991, and now distributes about 53 per cent of Coca-Cola's US bottle and can volume. The other two companies which CCE is acquiring are domestic - Roddy Coca-Cola Bottling and Coca-Cola Bottling of Johnson City, Tennessee. These businesses hold the licences for the Knoxville and Johnson City, Tennessee, areas, which in turn serve more than 1m consumers. Last year, the equivalent unit case volume reached around 18m, and produced revenues of about Dollars 86m.</p>

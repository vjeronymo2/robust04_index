Signs of an accord emerged  briefly when workers unblocked several rail lines and strike leaders from the  coastal city of Slupsk entered negotiations with the government. But strikers  abandoned the talks when the government refused to discuss their pay demands,  the official news agency PAP said. Today's balloting is for 48,000 seats in  local government.  </P></p>

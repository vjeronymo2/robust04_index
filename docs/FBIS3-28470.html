The Malaysian leader's visit can be described as historic in  the sense that it is the first official trip by a Malaysian  prime minister to the Philippines, since the two countries  established diplomatic ties in 1964. It also reciprocates the  visit of Philippine President Fidel Ramos to Malaysia last year.  [passage omitted]    Dr. Mahathir's entourage includes some cabinet ministers  holding key portfolios as well as about 60 corporate leaders and  businessmen which demonstrates the seriousness that is being  attached to increase economic and business cooperation. This  cooperation entered concrete term on the very first day of the  visit with the signing of the nine memoranda of understanding or  MOUs, involving the private sectors of the two countries.    The MOUs may lead to deals worth billions of ringgit. Apart  from injecting much-needed capital into the Philippine economy,  the deals are also in line with Malaysia's policy to boost  reverse investment. While the MOUs will be signed, officials of  the two countries got down to details of an investment guarantee  agreement, IGA, which is likely to be signed in the course of  the visit.

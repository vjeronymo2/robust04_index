			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / People: Comings and goings at GGT Jan Hall, until recently the chairman and chief executive of design company Coley Porter Bell, is about to join the quoted advertising and marketing services group Gold Greenlees Trott in the newly-created post of Europe supremo. The move, announced yesterday at the same time as the group's disappointing year-end figures, is part of attempts to strengthen a pan-European network, set up last year through a link-up with the privately-owned agency GGK. Hall's title will be chief executive, GGT Europe. Coley Porter Bell, where Hall had been for 10 years, was bought by Martin Sorrell's WPP group in 1989. Her last triumph, shortly before her departure, was landing a wholesale review of British Gas's corporate identity. She was also recently appointed a non-executive director of travel group Owners Abroad. GGT also announced yesterday that Michael Gold, co-founder with Mike Greenlees, would be leaving at the end of July, having moved with his family to France. The group is also hoping to restore its reputation in the City by appointing Peter Quinnen, a former chairman of James Capel, as a non-executive director. Quinnen has known the group since its flotation.</p>

			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Japan pledges Aids drive: A coup for Tokyo's health ministry Japan must strengthen its Aids prevention programmes because public health is a 'foundation of social and economic development', the country's prime minister, Mr Tomiichi Murayama, said yesterday. He was speaking at the opening of the 10th annual international conference on the disease, being held this week in Yokohama, near Tokyo. Crown Prince Naruhito, also in attendance, added his 'fervent desire that the not too distant future will see all Aids-related problems resolved' in Japan and the rest of the world. To have drawn both head of government and heir to the Chrysanthemum Throne to speak on a subject many western leaders have shunned represents a coup for the Japanese health ministry, which has been co-ordinating domestic organisation of the conference. More than 9,600 delegates are participating, about half from outside Japan. It is the first time the conference has been held in Asia, which scientists say will soon have more new infections with the HIV virus than any other continent. Hundreds of thousands have already contracted HIV in countries such as India and Thailand. Fewer than 4,000 in Japan have tested HIV positive, and most public hospitals maintain they are not equipped to treat Aids symptoms. Mr Murayama, who has been in office barely a month, pledged no particular measures beyond a commitment to work with other countries in dealing with the problem. 'When one thinks of the needs of the people living with Aids, waiting eagerly for the earliest possible establishment of care strategies, and of the efforts by those who offer support for these people, we have to strengthen our national programmes for the prevention and care of Aids and further promote international co-operation,' he said. Within Japan, however, the event promises to change attitudes. Press and broadcast media have been running daily features on HIV as a Japanese as well as global issue, and the arrival at the Yokohama venue yesterday of prince and premier will contribute to Mr Murayama's expressed desire for a 'mitigation of social prejudice' about the disease. A survey of 210 Osaka-based companies released last week showed that more than half would have no idea how to react to an HIV positive employee and only a tenth had conducted any Aids education for managers or workers. Although the health ministry has committed Y10.86bn (Pounds 71m) in the latest year to combating the disease, the Y150m it has spent on the conference may repay a greater dividend. National television footage last night showed Prince Naruhito and Mr Murayama sharing the platform, and a quiet word, with Mr Toshihiro Oishi, aged 25, the Japanese representative of the Global Network of People Living with HIV and Aids, an organisation which calls itself GNP+ for short. In their presence Mr Oishi told the conference he was gay, HIV positive, and that 'Japanese society is still far from being empathetic.' But Japan has made a start. The government is attempting to set aside some sexual taboos in order to ensure that the GNP it cares most about regains a plus-factor at the end of the country's longest postwar recession.</p>

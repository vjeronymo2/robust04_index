			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / International Company News: Steel division lifts Sandvik in first half SANDVIK, the Swedish engineering group, boosted first-half profits by 10 per cent to SKr994m (Dollars 123.5m) as a sharp improvement at its steel division offset the impact of continued weak demand. It said it remained on course to increase 1993 profits above last year's SKr1.53bn. The stronger Swedish krona helped the group lift sales by 25 per cent to SKr10.7bn, while orders rose 28 per cent to SKr11.3bn. Excluding acquisitions and currency movements, sales were 4 per cent lower. Demand was 'very weak' in Europe, particularly in Germany, and there was little evidence of recovery in Japan, the company said. However, it noted relatively strong growth in Australia and Asia and some growth in North America and most of Latin America. The star performer was the steel division, where profits rose to SKr231m from SKr95m on a 24 per cent increase in revenues to SKr3.25bn. The weaker krona helped the group lift volumes. The cemented carbide division lifted profits to SKr650m from SKr586m as sales swelled 34 per cent to SKr5.87bn. But the process systems division swung to a SKr24m loss from a SKr26m profit.</p>

			<p>940414 FT  14 APR 94 / Russia investment tax worry A senior Russian minister yesterday evaded western companies' worries that they may have to pay an 18.7 per cent tax on investments in Russia at a time when the country says it is desperate for foreign capital. Foreign investment may be affected by the December presidential decree which taxed loans in an attempt to fight Russian enterprises dodging VAT by making tax-free payments in the form of fake 'loans'. Mr Steve Hasson, tax partner at Price Waterhouse, said the new Russian move could 'hit inter-company loans from western parent companies to a Russian subsidiary, loans from the EBRD and the World Bank, as well as western commercial bank loans.' Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy prime minister responsible for the economy, hoped that President Boris Yeltsin's earlier decree to protect existing foreign investment from mid-stream tax changes would override the latest decree.</p>

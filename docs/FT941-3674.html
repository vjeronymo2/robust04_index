			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Takare founder ousted A ferocious boardroom row over management style at Takare ended last Friday afternoon when Mr Deverok Pritchard, one of the group's founders, was stripped of his executive duties. He was managing director and deputy chairman and is likely to receive compensation of about Pounds 130,000. However, Mr Pritchard, 52, appears to have dug his heels in remaining a non-executive director and can only be removed by a vote of shareholders. He holds 12.8m shares, 10.2 per cent of the total and was not available to comment either on his removal from office or any plans to sell the shares. Mr Keith Bradshaw, chairman, who set up Takare with Mr Pritchard 14 years ago, said he hoped for a resolution of the position before the annual meeting on April 21. In a strongly worded statement he said the entire board, aside from Mr Pritchard, had decided to 'terminate' Mr Pritchard's position as managing director. The disagreement was 'not susceptible to any other solution'. Mr Bradshaw said that the style needed to manage a group employing 7,000 people was very different to the entrepreneurial style appropriate when Takare was founded. Mr Hamilton Anstead moves up from deputy managing director to managing director, and Mr Ron Reid, finance director, adds commercial director to his role. Mr David Pegg, a non-executive, becomes deputy chairman.</p>

			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Leasehold boost for tenants' rights A NEW concession aimed at increasing tenants' rights was made by ministers yesterday as the House of Lords continued its discussion of the government's controversial legislation on leasehold reform, Alison Smith writes. The move will give eligible tenants the option of purchasing a lease extension on their flats. During yesterday's debate Lord Strathclyde, a junior environment minister, responded to concern that if leaseholders failed to achieve the necessary majority for enfranchising freeholds in a block of flats, they would not be allowed the fallback right of extending their leases. Lord Strathclyde said: 'I have decided that there is . . . a case for giving all qualifying tenants the option of purchasing a new (extended) lease'. Peers had warned tenants might not be able to persuade enough of their neighbours to trigger enfranchisement and so would not benefit at all from the leasehold reforms.</p>

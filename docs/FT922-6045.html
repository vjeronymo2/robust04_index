			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Leading Article: Italy's need for reform IT SOMETIMES seems to take a shock to make Italians realise that urgent action is required to avert a national crisis. It needed such a shock, in the form of popular indignation at the murder of the courageous anti-mafia magistrate, Mr Giovanni Falcone, to shame Italy's squabbling politicians into electing a new president. The insults hurled by mourners at Mr Falcone's funeral against leading politicians, including Mr Spadolini, the justice minister, reflected growing public outrage at the incapacity of the authorities to clamp down on the mafia's overlords. Thanks mainly to the efforts of individual judges prepared to risk their lives, successive crime and corruption scandals have brought to light the links between the mafia and some sections of the political establishment and the police. Until recently, corrupt practices were associated mainly with the Christian Democratic party, the ruling party throughout most of the post-Second World War era. But arrests made in the latest corruption scandal in Milan have demonstrated that the cancer has spread to other political groups, particularly former prime minister Bettino Craxi's Socialist party. So it is hardly any wonder that the Italian people have become more and more disillusioned with the old guard of politicians. The voters fired a powerful shot across their bows in the general election at the beginning of last month, when they deprived the outgoing four-party coalition of its overall parliamentary majority. The long-dominant Christian Democrats won less than 30 per cent of the overall vote for the first time. Signally failed The result was widely interpreted not only as a rejection of the old political parties - no fewer than 16 parties are represented in the new parliament - but as a desire for a reform of a political system which has signally failed to provide stable government. The farcical scenes which characterised the early rounds of the presidential election this month were a reversion to old-style Italian political practices and a negation of what the electorate appears to want. But the one positive outcome of the assassination of Mr Falcone is that it has brought the politicians to their senses. The business of forming a new government can now begin in earnest. The choice of Mr Oscar Luigi Scalfaro as president appears to be a good one. While he is a veteran member of the Christian Democratic party, his support has come from all parties. Above all Mr Scalfaro has a reputation for incorruptibility and is thus the man for the moment. Although his powers as head of state are strictly limited, he has considerable influence on the government-building process. That is important at a time when speed and good judgment are of the essence. Main tasks One of the new president's main tasks will be to persuade the politicians and the country as a whole that Italy has no more time to waste. Though a signatory of last year's Maastricht Treaty, Italy has yet to persuade its European partners that it can fulfil either the conditions of the projected economic and monetary union or the political union. It is still a very long way from meeting any of the economic convergence criteria laid down for full membership of Emu. More fundamentally, its partners must wonder whether it will be able to enforce the directives and other Community-wide legal instruments laws agreed collectively. The remedies are not difficult to find. Tough measures must be taken to bring the public deficit and debt under control, to cut subsidies to state industry and to reform the pensions system. Equally important is the fight against corruption and gangsterism. An important part of the solution will be an agressive programme of privatisation. This can only be done by a strong government, requiring a radical reform of the present electoral system. The fundamental condition for achieving all this is political will, which has so far been lacking. That resolution may now be provided by pressure from a people who seem finally to have had enough of political instability and corruption. Italy's politicians must be made to understand that there is no room for further procrastination.</p>

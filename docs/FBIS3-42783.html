Shamil Basayev was born in 1965 in Chechnya. After serving  as  a firefighter in the Air Force he entered the Moscow Institute  of Land Management. In 1988 he was dropped from the second  course because of bad grades but he remained in Moscow until  1991. He worked, in his words, "as one of the Chechen  cooperators" in a trade-intermediary limited liability  partnership. At the beginning of 1991 he returned to his  homeland and immediately entered the CPC forces.    Just five days after the conflict in Abkhazia began he  arrived there as chief of the first detachment of confederates.  In January 1993 at a joint session of the Presidential Council  and the Parliament of the CPC, Mr. Basayev was appointed  commander of the CPC expeditionary corps in Abkhazia. He was  assigned the duties of "coordinating, uniting, guiding into the  necessary channels, and supervising the flow of arriving  volunteers." Later confirmed by an edict of Vladislav Ardzinba  in the position of deputy minister of defense in the Gudauta  administration, Shamil Basayev stated that his rights extended  only to the mountain volunteers--only a part, albeit an  extremely significant one, of the Gudauta armed forces.    It is Shamil Basayev's conviction that "It was in Russia's  interests to have the Abkhaz-Georgian conflict grow into war so  that both sides would be brought to their knees." The  confederates knew ahead of time about the forthcoming  introduction of a military contingent. He evaluates the Georgian  troops as rabble who have to be called an army only because the  Georgian Government has supplied them with uniforms and  weapons." Georgia's defeat in the war is explained by the  absence of order in the government and the army and the "whole  idea--the idea of the sovereignty and unity of Georgia."    In Mr. Basayev's words, Russia granted no military aid to  Abkhazia. To the question of why the Russian Federation  ministers of defense and foreign affairs did not deny the report  about such aid, Mr. Basayev noted that he "cannot answer for all  the babble that goes around Moscow." The weapons, including the  latest costly tanks and aircraft, Mr. Basayev asserts, were  purchased privately: "There are many ways of making money--why  did Abkhazia need anybody's help? The CPC commander in chief  personally has 18 automatic Kalashnikovs, one machine gun, and  three pistols: "There are gobs of weapons in the Caucasus. In  the Northern Caucasus everyone is looking for a weapon, they all  buy them, but they will not fire!" In his opinion the  Confederation of Peoples of the Caucasus, which gives warning  about many possible conflicts, can take credit for that. In the  opinion of Shamil Basayev, the Fifth CPC Congress has  transformed the Confederation's troops into "peacemaking forces."</p>

			<p><P> March 31, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 2 REPUTEDLY HUNTED TARGETS FOR SLAYING  </P> <P> Two San Diego men charged with the slayings of a pair of Mexican laborers  scouted the murder site before and after the killings in search of other  targets, a prosecutor said Wednesday.  </P> <P> But A. David Stutz, the deputy district attorney prosecuting the case, said  after a Thursday hearing that the two had not found other prospective victims.  </P> <P> "If not for fate, there may have been other victims," said Stutz, who has  characterized the two suspects as "aspiring Rambos."  </P> <P> The two men were killed Nov. 9 along an isolated stretch of Black Mountain  Road, in a largely rural area frequented by migrant laborers seeking work in  nearby fields and nurseries. They were shot a total of 11 times with a South  Korean-made semiautomatic assault rifle, say authorities, who have recovered  the weapon.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Denied Bail Reduction  </P> <P> At Wednesday's hearing, Municipal Court Judge Charles L. Patrick refused to  lower the $250,000 bail of one of the suspects, Dennis Bencivenga. 19.  </P> <P> Mark McBride, the lawyer representing Bencivenga, asked that bail be reduced to  $50,000. The lawyer cited the suspect's ties to the community and the fact that  Bencivenga himself had come forward Jan. 13 and told of his alleged involvement  in the killings, providing authorities a crucial break in what had been a  stalled investigation.  </P> <P> Bencivenga's father testified that he would ensure that his son appeared for  all court hearings and comply with other legal restrictions if he were freed on  bail. The suspect's grandmother and two friends were also in the courtroom. The  tall, stocky suspect, wearing jail-issue blues, did not speak during the  session. But Stutz, the prosecutor, noting that the two victims were killed  "without any reason," argued that bail should not be lowered.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Preliminary Hearing Set  </P> <P> A preliminary hearing was scheduled for May 1.  </P> <P> Authorities have charged that the other suspect, Kenneth Kovzelove, 17, who is  in the custody of juvenile authorities, was the triggerman. A hearing is  scheduled April 14 in Juvenile Court to determine if Kovzelove, who turns 18 in  July, should be tried as an adult.  </P> <P> In the adult system, Kovzelove, like Bencivenga, could face up to life in  prison on a first-degree murder charge. He can only be held until age 25 in the  juvenile system.  </P> <P> Both suspects were arrested last week -- Bencivenga at his home in San Diego,  Kovzelove at Ft. Benning, Ga., where he was in training as an Army paratrooper.  </P> <P> Stutz, the prosecutor, said it is "very unlikely" that the death penalty will  be sought for Bencivenga. Because Kovzelove is a minor, he cannot be sentenced  to death.  </P> <P> The two victims have been identified by the coroner's office as Hilario  Casteneda Salgado, 22, and Matilde Macedo de la Sancha, 19, both citizens of  Mexico. Both were said to have lived in the bush near the slaying site.  </P></p>

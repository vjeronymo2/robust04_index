			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / O&amp;Y seeks to reassure holders of public bonds OLYMPIA &amp; York has assured holders of public bonds secured by two of its Canadian buildings that their security is intact and that all payments on the bonds are up to date. The debt-burdened developer said security was 'more than adequate' on CDollars 525m (Pounds 254.8m) of outstanding bonds on First Canadian Place, its 72-storey Toronto flagship, and 240 Sparks St, a government building in Ottawa. O&amp;Y was hit by a liquidity crisis last month after a run on its publicly traded commercial paper and problems in generating sufficient cash flow to meet its obligations at the Canary Wharf project in London's Docklands. It has called its 100 bank lenders to Toronto on April 13 to present debt restructuring proposals. The company made no mention of several other buildings in Canada and the US financed by public debt instruments. Meanwhile, a debate is under way within the Canadian banks on the appropriate response to the O&amp;Y crisis. Even by banking standards, the O&amp;Y account has been handled with unusual discretion. The Canadian banks' share prices have slipped an average of about 5 per cent in the past month. But Moody's, the US credit rating agency, said last week O&amp;Y's problems were unlikely to precipitate a downgrading of the banks' creditworthiness. Mr Allan Taylor, Royal Bank's chief executive, has said Royal's exposure was not 'life-threatening'. Observer, Page 15</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] [Announcer] A news conference on the new  proposal of the alternative group in the Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] was given today by one of the  alternative group's 10 representatives, Deputy Peter Tomecek.    [Begin recording] [Tomecek] The alternative of political  realism believes that a way out of this situation lies in the  possibility of stabilizing the political state of affairs in  Slovakia. This will lead to the creation of a government of  reason [vlada z rozumu], a so-called wider coalition. Such a  government would stabilize the situation in Slovakia until new  elections, which should resolve the political situation in  Slovakia.    Of course, we tried to discuss the point that, if we want  political stability in Slovakia, it would probably not be  feasible for top political representatives to enter such a  government. We therefore propose that our [HZDS]  representatives consider the possibility of having a government  without top political representation.    The prime minister accepted the alternatives that had  appeared in the press, the so-called four alternatives. On the  basis of the manner in which our group presented this  appeal--and, of course, because it also concerned him as  chairman of the movement and as the top political  representative--I think he will present his viewpoint at an  extraordinary meeting on Saturday [12 February]. My personal  opinion is that, if somebody holds different views, it does not  mean that he will leave the movement just because his views are  not accepted.    We have been building this movement a long time. We have  certain obligations, not only social ones but, of course, also  obligations toward this movement. Therefore, I do not suppose  the movement will splinter as you have formulated it.    [Correspondent] Will you support the government bill on  large-scale privatization?    [Tomecek] Of course, our group intends to support the  government bill. [passage omitted]    [Second correspondent] What was the result of voting in the  parliamentary club of the HZDS on the resignation of the two  deputy chairmen?    [Tomecek] Regrettably, I can announce that the resignations  of Vladimir Bajan and of Marian Kelemen were accepted. [passage  omitted] [end recording]</p>

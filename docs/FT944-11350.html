			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Business Travel: KLM deal KLM Royal Dutch Airlines says it is offering reductions of up to 35 per cent on business-class fares to destinations outside Europe from now to April 1. A spokeswoman said most reductions would be about 20 per cent, though 35 per cent was possible in some cases. KLM is aiming its reductions at business-class travellers whose companies have no formal ticket-purchasing contract with it - an area, said the spokeswoman, in which KLM faces heavy competition from other European carriers.</p>

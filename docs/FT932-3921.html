			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / UK Company News: New format stores for BHS STOREHOUSE, the retail group made up of the BHS, Mothercare and Blazer chains, is converting some underperforming BHS stores into a discount clothing and home goods format, and may open new outlets if the format is successful. The move will intensify speculation in the retail trade that the 1990s will see a rapid growth in lower-price, lower-margin retailing in the UK. Storehouse said that while searching for a way to revive some poorly-performing BHS stores it had concluded there was 'undoubtedly an opportunity' in the discount sector 'if you get it right'. Fifteen BHS stores, mainly in London and the south-east, will be converted to the new format, called One Up, in August and September. Their product range will include women's wear, men's and children's wear and home goods, at prices averaging about one third less than in BHS. Mr Simon Hughes, main board director responsible for One Up, said that as BHS increasingly targeted ABC1 customers, some smaller stores in areas with a different demographic profile had been struggling. The choice was to close, sell, or find a way of continuing to trade from the stores. 'We carried out a strategic review of the situation, and identified a gap in the market,' he said. As it was converting existing stores, launch costs of the new chain would be less than Pounds 1m. BHS introduced One Up products in several stores last year and said they had sold 'extraordinarily well'. If the converted stores are successful, Storehouse may open new One Up outlets. Storehouse would not say what margins it expected to operate off, but they would be 'lower than in BHS'. 'It won't be cheap and nasty,' Storehouse insisted. 'It will look like a good, smart store. But it will be bright, fun and zippy. I think the colours will be quite vigorous.'</p>

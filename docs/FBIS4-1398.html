			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg April 28 SAPA -- More arrests were to  follow after police arrested a 32nd suspect in connection with  the spate of bomb blasts on the Reef, Police Commissioner Gen  Johan van der Merwe said on Thursday [28 April].    Gen van der Merwe said in an SABC [South African  Broadcasting  Corporation] interview there was prima facie evidence that the  suspects had been involved in the explosions. They would be  brought before the courts soon.    It was difficult to say whether more Afrikaner  Weerstandsbeweging [Resistance Movement -- AWB] Ystergarde [Iron  Guard] members were involved, Gen van der Merwe said, but the  suspects came from a "certain circle" in the AWB.    Gen van der Merwe added that police were investigating  intimidation charges countrywide, but the charges could not be  described as "widescale".</p>

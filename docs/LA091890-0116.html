			<p><P> September 18, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BRADLEY SAYS MOSQUE SHOULD HAVE MINARETS  </P> <P> An Islamic mosque should be allowed to have exotic domes and minarets, Mayor  Tom Bradley said Monday as he condemned as "outrageous" a recent City Council  decision to require a proposed mosque in Granada Hills to alter its design to  conform with the neighborhood.  </P> <P> Bradley made the comments in a press release while traveling in Europe.  </P> <P> Mohammed Mohuiddin, president of the Islamic Center of Northridge, said he was  encouraged by the remarks. Mohuiddin heads the congregation that last Tuesday  won council permission to build a mosque on a 2.5-acre site near Rinaldi and  Encino boulevards.  </P> <P> "It would make us feel good to have it look like a mosque, not like a  warehouse," Mohuiddin said.  </P> <P> Bradley said he wanted the Cultural Affairs Commission to hold a hearing in 45  days in order to develop a city policy on design of religious buildings.  </P></p>

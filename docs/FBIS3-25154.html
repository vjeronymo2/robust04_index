			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The leader of the Afrikaner Volksfront [National  Front -- AVF], General Constand Viljoen, has called on political  leaders to end the national peace force project as it will not  serve its purpose. Speaking in Pretoria, Gen. Viljoen called on  political leaders not to waste manpower on an experiment which  the current commander acknowledged would not work. He said it  bordered on the irresponsible to rush the force through training  before turning it loose in a politically unstable country.    The DP [Democratic Party] candidate for the premiership in  the Western Cape, Mr. Henie Bester, has said the National  Peacekeeping Force is fast turning into a security farce.  Speaking at an interparty breakfast meeting in Cape Town, he  said alternative arrangements would have to be made urgently to  ensure a free and fair election in April and economic growth  afterwards.</p>

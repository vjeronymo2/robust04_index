			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Flotation likely to place Pounds 80m tag on Ashbourne Ashbourne Holdings, the nursing home operator acquired last year in a Pounds 50m management buy-out from Stakis, the hotels and casino group, yesterday said its forthcoming flotation would value the company at more than Pounds 80m. The management buy-out team, which admitted it had purchased the business 'at a very good price', aims to raise about Pounds 50m from the placing and open offer. Funds raised will be used to wipe out the group's Pounds 47.8m borrowings, enabling it to build new homes and buy development sites with Pounds 25m of fresh borrowing. The pathfinder prospectus, published yesterday, showed operating profits from the existing 19-home portfolio increased from Pounds 5.49m to Pounds 6.12m during the 12 months to October 2. Interest payments of Pounds 5.19m (Pounds 3.05m), however, led to a sharp fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.4m to Pounds 1.19m, on turnover up 9 per cent at Pounds 23.5m. At the operating level, the group enjoyed profit margins of 26 per cent and Mr Tom Hamilton, chief executive, said its high proportion of private patients promised further growth. He and fellow directors - who invested Pounds 200,000 at the buy-out stage - should see the value of their holding increase to between Pounds 2m and Pounds 2.4m if the issue is fully taken up. 'It looks a big ratio increase, but the existing shareholders will not be selling their stakes,' said Mr Lawrence Guthrie of Charterhouse Bank, sponsors to the float.</p>

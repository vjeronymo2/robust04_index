			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Andrey Kozyrev: We Proceed on the </F> Basis of Pure Pragmatism in Cooperation with NATO"]    [Text] Russia's Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev announced  Monday [20 June] that during his visit to Brussels, and in  addition to the document on joining NATO's "Partnership for  Peace" initiative, he will also sign a protocol concerning  Russia's direct cooperation with NATO.    Emphasizing the second document's importance in a  conversation with journalists, the Russian Federation's foreign  minister said that Russia is interested "not only, and maybe  even not so much, in signing the 'Partnership for Peace'  program, but in the Russia-NATO program."    An ITAR-TASS correspondent was told by the minister's  adviser  Galina Sidorova that the protocol on cooperation with the North  Atlantic alliance is a "ramified document." She reminded him  that the program for Russia's cooperation with NATO, which was  elaborated by Russian experts, was presented by Defense Minister  Pavel Grachev to his NATO partners during his recent visit to  the alliance headquarters. Afterwards, Russian diplomats and  their NATO colleagues used it as a basis to prepare a document  acceptable to both sides. Work is still being done on details,  but Russia's most important wishes have been taken into account.  "The protocol will incorporate virtually all provisions in the  program suggested by us to NATO," G. Sidorova said.</p>

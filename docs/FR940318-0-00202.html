			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NPRM listed HCFC&hyph;123 as pending review for use as a substitute for tobacco  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expansion. One commenter proposed that HCFC&hyph;123 should not be listed as an acceptable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substitute in the final rule because the sole U.S. manufacturer will not sell it for use in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tobacco expansion process. The sole U.S. manufacturer of HCFC&hyph;123 confirmed via public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment that HCFC&hyph;123 will not be sold to the tobacco industry for use in the tobacco  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expansion process. The manufacturer requested EPA to withdraw this compound from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consideration as an alternative for this end-use. Subsequently, EPA terminated the review for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HCFC&hyph;123 in tobacco expansion, and will not include HCFC&hyph;123 in the listing decisions for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this sector.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Listing Decisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Carbon dioxide. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Agency has determined that the use of carbon dioxide as a substitute for CFC&hyph;11  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in tobacco expansion is acceptable. Carbon dioxide has been successfully used in the tobacco  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry for approximately twenty years. It is non-toxic, non-flammable, and it has zero  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ODP. A permissible exposure level (PEL) has been set at 5,000 ppm, a level that can easily  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be met during the well contained tobacco expansion process. The carbon dioxide process is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> similar to the process using CFC&hyph;11, though pressure and temperature parameters are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different. For this reason carbon dioxide cannot be used as a retrofit for CFC&hyph;11 equipment;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> new equipment must be purchased in order to use carbon dioxide for tobacco expansion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, increased use of carbon dioxide for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tobacco expansion will not increase global warming because the carbon dioxide used in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tobacco expansion is a by-product of the production of other gases. The carbon dioxide is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> captured from a stream of gas that otherwise would be emitted to the ambient air.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, carbon dioxide recycling equipment is available, which will also help limit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Propane.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Agency has determined that the use of propane as a substitute for CFC&hyph;11 in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tobacco expansion is acceptable. Plant modifications may be necessary to control the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flammability of this substitute to ensure worker safety. Propane is a VOC and must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled as such under Title I of the CAA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> K. Adhesives, Coatings, and Inks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Overview  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Methyl chloroform (MCF) is used as a solvent in the adhesives, coatings, and inks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sector because of its unique and favorable properties: High solvency, non flammability, low  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> toxicity, relative high stability, and low boiling point. For this section, coatings are defined to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be durable and decorative coatings such as paints. Unlike a number of other solvents that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> classified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs), MCF does not photochemically degrade in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the lower atmosphere to lead to ground-level ozone formation. This key property caused  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> many manufacturers to switch from formulations containing VOC solvents to MCF in the mid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1980s because regulatory pressure increased to reduce VOC emissions in nonattainment areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Companies achieved compliance by altering their VOC solvent-borne formulations to MCF,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thereby avoiding costly capital investment in new equipment, changes in operating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures, and employee retraining. This trend has now been reversed as companies have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> begun to respond to the phase-out of MCF under the stratospheric ozone protection provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Clean Air Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This section examines substitutes that can be used in place of MCF in this sector, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presents the Agency's proposed decisions and supporting analysis on acceptability of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substitutes. These determinations are summarized in appendix B at the end of the sector  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Of the three uses for MCF in this sector, use of MCF is largest in the adhesives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsector. In 1989, manufacturers of adhesives consumed about 28,000 metric tons (MT) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MCF in their formulations, roughly nine percent of the total MCF produced in the U.S.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (HSIA, 1991). Solvent-based adhesive formulations constitute 15 percent of all adhesive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> types. MCF is desirable as a solvent for adhesives because it evaporates rapidly, is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonflammable, exhibits a relatively high PEL, performs comparably to VOC-formulated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products, and does not photochemically degrade in the lower atmosphere. The 1991  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumption of methyl chloroform as a solvent in the adhesives sector was estimated to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 32,000 MT. EPA believes that this consumption has declined since 1991 due to increased  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> excise taxes, the CFC labeling requirement of the CAA and the increasing awareness of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pending 1996 phaseout.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MCF is used in five adhesive types:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Laminate adhesives;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Flexible foam adhesives;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Hardwood floor adhesives;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Metal to rubber adhesives; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / Evolution helps trusts pass the fitness test: The revival of a Pounds 20bn investment sector The investment trust industry is enjoying a revival. According to SG Warburg, the average discount to net assets, the key measure of the sector's health, recently touched a 20-year low of 8.7 per cent. In part, this is because of the bull market in equities. Trusts, as collective funds which invest in shares, are a simple way for investment institutions and private individuals to move quickly into the stock market. The investment trust sector, worth Pounds 20bn, has produced an impressive performance over the past 12 months, as assets have risen and the discounts have narrowed. Over the year to July 30, the average investment trust returned growth (including reinvested income) of 66.7 per cent, according to the Association of Investment Trust Companies. The FT-A Investment Trust Index reached an all-time high of 1706.89 on August 18. But to understand why the industry is currently so healthy, one has to go back to the problems the sector faced in the late 1970s. It was originally set up as a means of giving the private investor access to a wide portfolio of shares, but by the 1970s historical accident had caused trusts' shareholder registers to be dominated by the life insurance companies and pension funds. Many of those investment institutions thought it more cost efficient for them to manage their own portfolios, rather than pay a fee to an investment trust company to do so. They were thus willing sellers of investment trust shares. As the price of investment trust shares is set by supply and demand, this led to the wide discount at which trust shares traded in the late 1970s. Investment trust managers spent the 1980s attacking the discount problem in two ways. The first was to bring back the private investor. The second was to find new ways of persuading institutions to buy the trusts' management expertise. Trusts had faced a crucial problem in attracting private investors; as stock market companies, they were unable to advertise their shares. In 1984, Foreign &amp; Colonial, one of the leading trust groups, hit upon an ingenious solution: a savings scheme, which allowed investors to buy small amounts of shares each month. From small beginnings (Pounds 89,504 invested in 1984), savings schemes have grown into an important source of demand for shares, with Pounds 102m invested in the first half of 1993. The introduction of Personal Equity Plans also helped attract new investors. Income and capital gains made within a Pep are free of UK tax. For a brief period, investment trust new issues were the only way the small investor could put the full Pounds 6,000 annual Pep allowance into a diversified portfolio. The tax-free label helped M&amp;G raise Pounds 376m for two new issues in 1991-92. The fall in base rates now makes many high-yielding investment trust Peps look very competitive with building society returns. The private investor has also been drawn back into the world of trusts by the revival of the split capital sector. Traditional investment trusts offer a mixture of income and capital growth. But for tax reasons, many investors want only one or the other. In a split capital trust, all the revenue goes to one class of share, while the capital growth goes elsewhere. A typical split might be income shares (having a high yield but a modest repayment value), zero coupon shares (having no yield but offering steady capital growth) and capital shares (having no yield and offering highly geared capital growth). Because such shares can be highly tax-efficient (especially when held in a Pep), there is plenty of demand for split capital trusts shares. Such trusts often stand at a premium, rather than a discount, to asset value. The second trick - keeping the interest of the investment trust institutions  -has been achieved by specialisation. In the 1970s, the sector was dominated by the generalist trusts, which offered either an international, or a UK-based, spread of shares. Neither kind offered any added value to the institutions. But a trust specialising in, say, Thailand or Korea offers an investment opportunity which even a large institution might find too costly to pursue on its own. Thus, the 1980s saw a ruthless evolutionary process in the sector. Old generalist trusts, standing at heavy discounts, either disappeared to predators looking for cheap assets or restructured themselves as geographical specialists, or split capital funds. New issues tended to be specialised, rather than generalist. So is the newly reformed investment trust sector better placed than ever or has the recent rally been overdone? Some trusts certainly stand at apparently unsustainable premiums; shares in Templeton Emerging Markets, for example, trade at a premium of 17.6 per cent. In other words, an investor has to pay Pounds 117.60 to get Pounds 100 of assets. Whether the sector discount has moved to a permanently lower level is a more difficult question. Mr Lewis Aaron, analyst at SG Warburg, does not believe so. 'Private clients tend to be fickle. If we had a correction in the market, discounts could well widen,' he says. Even if demand does not fall, supply could tip the balance. With some trust shares at a premium, existing managers have taken the opportunity to issue new shares to soak up demand. Other managers have brought new trusts to the market. According to SG Warburg, the sector has raised a net Pounds 775m since the end of September 1992, with more new issues in the pipeline. There may come a point when the sector overreaches itself.</p>

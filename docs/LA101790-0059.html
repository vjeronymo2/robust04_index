			<p><P> October 17, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ELECTIONS;  </P> <P> 'SHOWCASE OF CANDIDATES';  </P> <P> ALLERT SAYS BOLAND WAFFLED ON ISSUES  </P> <P> Democratic Assembly candidate Irene Allert, speaking Tuesday at a candidates  forum, accused her Republican opponent Paula Boland of changing her position on  several controversial state and local issues. Holding up a box of frozen  waffles, Allert said Boland in recent months has altered her positions on  offshore oil drilling, term limits for state officeholders and the massive  Porter Ranch development.  </P> <P> Boland, who is considered the front-runner in the 38th Assembly District race,  cited her involvement in securing state funds for the Simi Valley Freeway  improvements and her work on other local civic projects during opening remarks  before more than 200 local realty agents, property owners and business people.  </P> <P> Boland and Allert are battling to succeed Assemblywoman Marian W. La Follette  (R-Northridge), who is retiring after a decade in the Legislature. The race has  drawn attention as the only one for state office in the San Fernando Valley  this year in which no incumbent is running.  </P> <P> Boland, 50, has stressed her anti-crime position and her credentials as a  conservative and longtime foot soldier in local GOP circles. She also has vowed  to continue La Follette's long but thus far futile fight to carve the Los  Angeles Unified School District into smaller units.  </P> <P> Allert, 46, is campaigning as an abortion-rights advocate and an opponent of  the massive Porter Ranch development in the Chatsworth hills north of the Simi  Valley Freeway. She is supported by a number of women's groups and labor  unions.  </P> <P> Political analysts say Boland is the probable winner in the 38th District,  which forms a rough horseshoe-shaped area across the Valley from Hidden Hills  in the west to La Crescenta in the east and where Republicans outnumber  Democrats 83,000 to 72,000.  </P> <P> In addition, Boland holds a large fund-raising lead over Allert, taking in  $102,000 to Allert's $43,000 in the reporting period that ended Oct. 5.  </P> <P> In her opening statement Tuesday night, Allert said the campaign has "taken on  a completely new symbol" as she held up the box of frozen blueberry waffles.  </P> <P> "There are several areas where my opponent has waffled," Allert said.  </P> <P> Allert said that during the spring primary election Boland said she opposed  term limits for state Assembly and Senate members. More recently however,  Boland has expressed support for Proposition 140, which limits Assembly terms  to six years and state Senate terms to eight years.  </P> <P> However, Boland campaign manager Mark Q. Thompson denied that Boland has  shifted her position. Thompson said after the forum that Boland opposes a  different term limitation initiative, Proposition 131, because it would also  use tax dollars to finance political campaigns. He said Boland supports  Proposition 140.  </P> <P> The forum was sponsored by area business organizations. Organizers invited four  Valley-area congressman -- Reps. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley), Anthony C.  Beilenson (D-Los Angeles), Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) and Howard L. Berman  (D-Panorama City), but none of them showed up.  </P> <P> The incumbents each cited pressing business in Washington, Board of Realtors  spokeswoman Millie Jones said.  </P></p>

			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Finance and The Family: Directors' deals - Are they a guide? / The significance of boardroom share manoeuvres Can directors predict the direction of their companies' share price better than the average outsider? Investors and academics alike have been intrigued by this question. Clearly, many believe that buying shares when directors buy, and selling when they sell, is a sound investment strategy. This has produced a demand for the type of directors' trading information produced by specialist agencies such as Directus, which is summarised each Saturday in the Weekend FT. Academics, too, have brought their databases and statistical analyses to bear on the problem. Early studies in the United States seemed to confirm that it was possible to outperform the market by following directors' transactions. Unfortunately, later research suggested that the outperformance was larger in small firms. In both the US and Britain, the bid/offer spread (the difference between the price at which a broker will buy and sell shares) is larger in the case of small companies. Because of this, it appears that returns probably were not big enough to cover the costs of dealing when the directors did so. The first studies in the UK produced conflicting results, with one suggesting insignificant (although positive) returns following directors' purchases and significant negative returns following sales. The other, which used the Financial Times directors' trading reports as its data source, showed highly significant positive returns following purchases but insignificant negative returns after sales. Given the contradictory evidence from previous research, we undertook a study* to see if it was, in fact, possible to earn abnormal returns by copying the directors' trading patterns. Abnormal returns are the differences between actual returns and those which might have been expected from general market movements and the relative risk of the shares. In the table, it appears that statistically significant abnormal returns of around 14.5 per cent arise in the two years following directors' purchases, with -6.5 per cent arising in the two years following sales. Roughly two-thirds of these totals are earned by the end of the first year, with comparatively little occurring in the first month following the trade. Our research showed also that the large proportion of the positive abnormal returns following directors' purchases occur in small and medium size firms. We believe it is essential to allow for the fact that such firms outperformed larger firms during the period of the investigation (1984-1988). More generally, research by professors Elroy Dimson and Paul Marsh, of the London Business School, has shown that small firms have, on average, performed considerably more strongly than large firms since 1955. If an allowance is not made for this, it is easy to confuse apparently significant outperformance with a 'small firms' effect. Once we take this superior performance by smaller companies into account, the size of these apparently significant abnormal returns is reduced substantially. Although they remain significant statistically after directors' purchases, they become insignificant following sales. Excluding all purchases and sales related to share options, the 'buy' transactions produce cumulative average abnormal returns of about 2.3 per cent after six months, 6 per cent after 12 months, and 8.9 per cent after two years, with the latter two returns being significant statistically. On the 'sell' side, the average transaction underperforms by 1.6 per cent after six months, 1.5 per cent after 12 months and 2.1 per cent after two years, although none of these returns is significant. In our view, these figures - adjusted for 'size effect' - are the true average superior returns which accrue to a strategy of copying directors' transactions in their own companies. But there are two caveats. One is that our data is based necessarily upon a sample of 1,653 non-option-related trades in 150 companies. Another is that this sample was selected to exclude any firms which were taken over or went into receivership between 1984 and 1988. Nonetheless, some striking conclusions emerge from this research. The first is that 'buy' signals have much stronger associations with outperformance than do 'sell' signals with underperformance. The second is that the outperformance persists for as much as two years after the directors' purchases. This is consistent with directors taking a medium to long term view of their company's prospects when buying shares. Finally, this research emphasises the need to take proper account of both a share's risk and its size-related return when measuring the abnormal performance associated with any trading strategy. Failing to recognise this 'small companies effect' can mis-represent substantially the scale of these abnormal returns. *UK Directors' Trading: The Impact of Dealings in Smaller Firms, by Alan Gregory, John Matatko, Ian Tonks and Richard Purkis; The Economic Journal, January 1994.

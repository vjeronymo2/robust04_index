			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / International Company News: Funding first for Hongkong Bank Hongkong Bank yesterday launched its maiden floating-rate certificates of deposit (CDs), raising a minimum HKDollars 1bn to secure medium rate funding. The CDs are likely to become the first private debt issue eligible as collateral to the discount window run by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the colony's de facto central bank. Ultimately, this should enable the bank to raise funds at more favourable terms, as the CDs may be able to be to be used in sale and repurchase agreements (repos). The bank would need to secure an A- rating for the CDs before the HKMA will accept its bid. If Hongkong Bank is successful in securing the rating, this would be the first issue by a commercial bank to be accepted as Repos. Bankers expect the final size of the issue, which marks the colony's biggest deposit-taker's first floating-rate CD market, to swell to double or even treble the original HKDollars 1bn. The three-year CDs will be priced at 25 basis points above the one-month Hong Kong interbank offered rate (Hibor), which stood at 4.8 per cent yesterday. The HKMA amended its rules in March, paving the way for certain instruments other than exchange fund bills and notes and government bonds to be used as collateral for the liquidity adjustment facility. Hongkong Bank last tapped the debt markets in a big way last November, when it raised HKDollars 3bn through a 10-year subordinated collared floating-rate note. Hang Seng Bank, the Hong Kong banking subsidiary of HSBC, tapped the CD market for HKDollars 2.2bn in May this year.</p>

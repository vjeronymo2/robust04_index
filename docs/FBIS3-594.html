Mr Meyer's announcement that the government was prepared to  negotiate with the Independent Electoral Commission and the  Transitional Executive Council to allow further time for the  Inkatha Freedom Party and the Freedom Front to submit their  candidates lists was almost drowned out by right-wingers' chants  and singing of the national anthem.    Mr Meyer said, however, the two parties should give a clear  indication within the next 24 hours on whether they wanted to  submit candidates lists.    Campus security personnel handcuffed and arrested a number  of  students after scuffles broke out in the hall. Right-wing  students surged forward, yelling "Constand, Constand (Constand  Viljoen, chairman of the Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front])"  and heckled Mr Meyer. Mr Meyer said he would not be threatened,  and that the university authorities should act against the  errant students.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Yerevan ("Azg", "Hayastani Hanrapetutyun" dailies),  04/05/94 -- Communications between the Armenian, Georgian and  Baku dispatchers, the pilots of the flying-by Russian jet and  the Iranian plane which crashed in Mountainous Karabakh on March  17 are already available to Armenian authorities. According to  these recordings, at 7:02 pm Greenwich time the plane was flying  near Akstafa, contacted Tbilisi and informed they have a 20 km  deviation and must return back. It nevertheless continued the  flight and appeared near Dalyar (Ganja). Communications with  the plane stopped at 7:12. The Azeri anti-air system has been  controlling the plane when it passed over the Azeri territory.    Referring to the communique by the Iranian MFA [Ministry of  Foreign Affairs], the RA [Republic of Armenia] acting  presidential press secretary Levon Zurabyan said, there is no  final explanation to the crash yet. "In addition to this", he  stressed, "only 3-4 of the 17 stated questions were clarified".  Meanwhile new questions appeared. It is known, for instance,  that the airplane entered the Ganja-Mardakert-Stepanakert air  route 15 minutes later, than it should according to the  calculations. "It is not clear what the airplane has been doing  in this period", said Levon Zurabyan.    Meanwhile the presidential press secretary again assured  this  accident will not affect the Armenian-Iranian relations and  there should be no unclarified problems between the two  countries. "Iran didn't take any punishment measures against  Armenia", Mr. Zurabyan declared, answering questions of  journalists.</p>

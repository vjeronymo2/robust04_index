			<p><P> April 9, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLAN TO LINK AMPHITHEATERS SPARKS INQUIRY;  </P> <P> MUSIC: THE U.S. JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS STUDYING WHETHER A PROPOSED ASSOCIATION  OF IRVINE MEADOWS AND PACIFIC AMPHITHEATRE WOULD CHOKE COMPETITION. THE  DEPARTMENT ALSO IS SEEKING PROMOTERS' BUSINESS RECORDS WITH 29 SOUTHLAND  VENUES.  </P> <P> A proposed alliance between Orange County's two giant concert amphitheaters has  prompted an investigation into the possible "elimination of competition" and a  wide-ranging inquiry into the Southland's concert industry by the U.S. Justice  Department's antitrust division, industry officials said Friday.  </P> <P> Documents obtained by The Times indicate that the government is studying a  proposed association between the operators of the Pacific Amphitheatre in Costa  Mesa and Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre that could be in violation of four  provisions of the Sherman Antitrust Act.  </P> <P> Gary Spratling, chief of the Justice Department's antitrust division in San  Francisco, confirmed the inquiry but declined to comment further.  </P> <P> But Justice Department documents indicate that the antitrust division is  seeking detailed business records from Orange County and Los Angeles-area  promoters who might have arranged events at 29 venues in Southern California,  virtually all the local concert facilities -- including the Shrine, the  Pantages, UCLA's Royce Hall, Greek Theatre, Hollywood Bowl, Coliseum, Sports  Arena and a number of other concert sites -- as well as Irvine Meadows and the  Pacific Amphitheatre.  </P> <P> Specifically, investigators are interested in dates of concerts, names of  performers and facilities where concerts were held, ticket sale revenue, memos,  phone records, ledgers, contracts and numbers of tickets sold for events since  Jan. 1, 1985.  </P> <P> The information was to be provided by last Friday for the investigation that  was triggered following an overture last month from the Nederlander  Organization, which built and operates the Pacific, to a group of private  investors that owns Irvine Meadows. One promoter said he was asking for an  extension because of the exhaustive list of documents requested.  </P> <P> The documents further indicate that the government is looking into, among other  things, possible restraint of trade, monopolization -- if one company  controlled both venues -- and attempts to acquire stock or ownership of a  company for the purpose of lessening competition.  </P> <P> But if approved, the alliance between the 18,765-capacity Pacific and the  15,000-capacity Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre could end years of bitter rivalry.  </P> <P> Ever since the Pacific opened in 1983, two years after Irvine Meadows, the  facilities have waged high-stakes bidding wars to book the hottest rock, pop,  country and jazz attractions. Each amphitheater has offered about 35 to 55  concerts annually.  </P> <P> This competition has meant more money for entertainers but also higher ticket  prices. Pacific Amphitheatre officials said joint operation of the  amphitheaters would open the door to other promoters, stimulate competition and  benefit ticket buyers. At the same time, entertainers would no longer benefit  from the bidding war for their services.  </P> <P> Several officials at the Nederlander Organization approached owners of Irvine  Meadows with an offer to form "an association," Nederlander attorney Neil  Papiano said Friday. Negotiations between the two parties are still under way  as the Justice Department inquiry continues, he said.  </P> <P> Papiano, who also is a partner in Nederlander, said that an association with  Irvine Meadows would increase, not eliminate, competition by breaking the  exclusive booking arrangement that Irvine struck in 1983 with Avalon  Attractions.  </P> <P> Nederlander is a New York firm that books and promotes concerts nationwide.  Avalon is Southern California's largest independent concert promoter and has  been a fierce rival with Nederlander in Orange County and Los Angeles for  touring concert attractions.  </P> <P> Concert industry sources familiar with the deal said that Nederlander and Ogden  Allied Leisure Services, a major concessionaire, together have bid to buy a  majority interest in Irvine Meadows from its owners. Nederlander and Ogden are  also partners in a proposal to build an indoor sports and concert arena in  Anaheim.  </P> <P> Papiano declined to provide more details about the nature of the association,  saying "negotiations are ongoing and several possibilities have been  discussed."  </P> <P> If Nederlander is successful in breaking Avalon's exclusive booking agreement,  Papiano said, "a lot of people will benefit from this -- not just us --  (because), if it is consummated, anybody can book shows there. . . . This would  be a substantial benefit to concert-goers, and to all the promoters in the  area. . . ."  </P> <P> "That's why we believe (the deal) will ultimately be approved and why all of us  are cooperating completely and fully in providing anything that anybody (in the  Justice Department) wants," he added.  </P> <P> Neither Robert Geddes, Irvine Meadows' managing partner, nor his partners --  developer Donald M. Koll and Newport Beach attorney Paul Hegness -- could be  reached for comment. Geddes is also a partner in Avalon Attractions.  </P> <P> Avalon Attractions President Brian Murphy said, "I don't know if I should  comment. The U.S. Department of Justice has started an investigation into  whether or not they feel this move is being made to eliminate competition  between the two facilities."  </P> <P> Like Avalon Attractions' arrangement with Irvine Meadows, Nederlander has had  an exclusive right to promote concerts at the Pacific Amphitheatre. Nederlander  books and operates the Pacific on a 40-year lease with the state-owned Orange  County Fair, on whose property the amphitheater was built.  </P> <P> As to whether other promoters would enjoy the same access to the Pacific as  Nederlander is hoping to gain at Irvine Meadows, Papiano said, "Yes, that is a  possibility."  </P> <P> If that is true, for the first time Orange County could become an open field  for concert promoters.  </P> <P> San Diego rock promoter Bill Silva said he would "absolutely" be interested in  booking shows at the Orange County amphitheaters. "There would be a few  instances a year where, if the venues were open to us, we'd love to book them.  . . . That's why we are watching with great interest what happens in Orange  County."  </P> <P>  Times staff writer Dan Weikel and free-lance writer Jim Washburn contributed  to this report.  </P> <P> </P></p>

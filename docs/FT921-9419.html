			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Senior bourses take their cue from a variety of sources SENIOR bourses moved for a variety of reasons yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. Special situations in Paris vied with sector analysis in Frankfurt and Amsterdam, interest rate hopes in Zurich and Madrid and sheer relief in Stockholm. PARIS saw some volatility, but a slightly easier close, the CAC 40 index losing 1.49 to 1,864.06 in relatively light turnover of FFr1.8bn. Perrier continued to advance on continued hopes of a counterbid. Dealers reported big buyers but only small amounts of stock on offer, which drove the price up by FFr29 to FFr1,530 with 67,100 shares traded, less than half the volume seen on Monday. Other gainers included Pechiney CI's which rose FFr11 or 3.8 per cent to FFr301 with 104,000 units exchanged on 1991 turnover in line with expectations. Dealers also reported big turnover in Esso, the subsidiary of Exxon Corp, which jumped FFr23 or 3.4 per cent after a newsletter reported that Saudi Arabia's state oil company, Saudi Aramco, was in talks with Exxon for a stake in its European oil refining and marketing operations. But some analysts said the Saudi story sounded unlikely and attributed the rise to hopes of an increase in the 1991 dividend from FFr25 to FFr40. Eurotunnel slumped FFr1.85 or 4 per cent to FFr44 with 2.2m shares traded in a delayed reaction to Monday's news of a delay in the tunnel's opening. FRANKFURT moved chemicals after a shift of recommended weightings within the sector by Deutsche Bank Research. DBR took Bayer, traditionally highly priced, down from overweight to underweight and the shares fell DM2.90 to DM302.70. BASF, up DM1.50 to DM248.50, was moved from underweight to neutral, and Hoechst (up DM1.70 to DM253.80) from underweight to overweight. DBR added, however, that it expects Bayer to hold its DM13 a share dividend, and those from BASF and Hoechst to be cut, each by DM2 a share, to DM11 for 1991. Hopes of maintained dividends all round were advanced as the reason why the whole sector rose on Monday. Otherwise, the market was mired in a narrow trading range, the FAZ index rising 2.19 to 688.72 at midsession and the DAX only 1.42 to 1,683.55 as volume rose from DM4.5bn to DM5.4bn. AMSTERDAM rose marginally, the CBS Tendency Index up 0.6 at 121.9. KLM gained on the back of strong British Airways third quarter results: it rose Fl 1.30 to Fl 39.20 with foreign buying evident. ING, the insurer, fell Fl 0.60 to Fl 51.10 after news that it was looking at cooperation with the Belgian Banque Bruxelles Lambert rather than stakebuilding. The trading group, Borsumij, put on Fl 4.70, or 8 per cent to Fl 62.70 after indicating a 70 per cent fall in 1991 net profits on Monday. News that the group had been released from a distribution contract for the Benelux and that a new interim management was in place boosted the shares. KBB put on Fl 4.00, or 5.7 per cent, to Fl 73.00: investors took a positive view on the reorganisation of its Hema division. ZURICH ended an active session ahead on easier short-term interest rates and a firmer Swiss bond market. The all-share SPI index rose 6.7 to 1,127.1. The average yield on Swiss government bonds has fallen to 6.01 per cent from 6.20 per cent at the end of January, but dealers said yesterday that some investors were now switching funds from money market and bonds into shares. STOCKHOLM reacted favourably to Ericsson's 1991 result, despite a 67 per cent drop in pre-tax profit. Having discounted the worst earlier, Ericsson B closed SKr2 higher at SKr117 after peaking at SKr123, in turnover of SKr98m. The Affarsvarlden General index put on 3.5 to 957.4 in turnover of SKr405m. Meanwhile Astra, the pharmaceutical company, saw its restricted A shares rise SKr4 to a new all-time-high of SKr559 after a London note on its relative attractions compared with Glaxo. MADRID firmed with interest rate speculation and a more positive feeling over tomorrow's January inflation figures helping to boost the market: the general index closed up 2.90 at 259.04. Construction was active, analysts commenting that local investors were probably looking for short-term profits. MILAN was marginally easier in dull trading with dealers reporting little activity ahead of the monthly options expiry today, apart from some selling in Ifil savings shares which lost L33 to L2,825. The Comit index fell 0.74 to 541.21 in turnover estimated at less than Monday's L79bn. Among leading industrials. Fiat fell L5 to L4,975 while Olivetti rose L76 or 2.7 per cent to L2,816 in technical trading. Burgo, the paper stock, continued to weaken, losing 1.9 per cent or L175 to L8,715. BRUSSELS saw the electronics stock Barco rise FFr30 to FFr1,136 in unusually heavy volume of 30,800 shares. The Bel-20 index closed down 0.60 at 1,163.96. HELSINKI's Hex index hit a new closing high for the year, closing 7.10 higher at 895.07 after two major companies reported 1991 results, and interest rates fell. Kone reported profits down, but in line with expectations, and its free-B shares rose FM15 to FM435. Enso closed unchanged; it was hit by exchange rates and reported a higher than expected loss of FM950m. VIENNA rose to its highest level in 1992 in a lively session. The 18-share ATX index added 7.02 to 1,024.15. ISTANBUL fell to its lowest level since the end of December, the index closing off 275.83, or 6.2 per cent, to 4,182.96. The fall was attributed to heavy selling due to a tight lira, as well as a delay in the preparation of a government plan to develop the capital markets.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - FEB 11  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  -----------------------------------------------------------------------    Open    10 am    11 am    12 pm     1 pm     2 pm     3 pm    close 1139.67  1140.24  1140.63  1139.84  1139.03  1139.99  1138.74  1137.74  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                 Day's High  1141.35    Day's Low  1137.22  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Feb 10     Feb 7     Feb 6     Feb 5     Feb 4 1137.68   1137.10   1138.76   1138.71   1132.79  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE;  </P> <P> DISPUTE WITH CITY ENDS PLANS FOR HOTEL  </P> <P> La Quinta Inns has dropped plans to build a three-story hotel after a dispute  with the city.  </P> <P> The City Council was told this week that the San Antonio-based company was  withdrawing from its agreement to build the 172-room hotel on 2.8 acres on the  southwest corner of Haster Street and Garden Grove Boulevard.  </P> <P> The project's progress had been complicated by a dispute between the city and  La Quinta over elevating the building because of its location in the Santa Ana  River flood-plain area.  </P> <P> The city required that the development be raised five feet above grade to  provide flood protection, but La Quinta balked, maintaining that improvements  in nearby levees and bridges made the elevation unnecessary.

			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WALL STREET: AFTER A YEAR, TIME-WARNER DEAL READS LIKE BAD SCRIPT  </P> <P> It was one year ago this week that Time Inc. and Warner Communications  announced plans to merge. It was supposed to be a simple transaction: The two  companies would exchange stock, and, once combined, they'd be mighty enough to  take on foreign entertainment giants.  </P> <P> "Mind-boggling" was the phrase most often used then to describe the potential  of the new company.  </P> <P> Today, however, that transaction looks anything but simple. And a lot of folks  on Wall Street, and shareholders of Time in particular, are describing its  combination with Warner as mindless rather than mind-boggling. In fact, from a  shareholder point of view, the combination of Time and Warner could go down in  history as one of the worst deals ever.  </P> <P> The new company, called Time Warner Inc., is struggling against a number of  unexpected obstacles in the raucous cable-TV business. And it's also being hurt  by a weakening economy that has been cutting advertising revenue at Time's  legendary magazine empire.  </P> <P> But the biggest problem is the sudden aversion that America has to companies  that are deeply in debt. And Time Warner has plenty.  </P> <P> Time and Warner never completed their simple stock-for-stock merger  transaction. You might recall that Paramount Communications, a rival to Warner  in the entertainment business, upset that plan by offering to acquire Time for  $10.7 billion in cash.  </P> <P> Time and Warner had their hearts set on their arranged marriage, so Time turned  Paramount down flat.  </P> <P> It took a couple of months of intense fighting in and out of the courts, but  eventually Time and Warner came up with a plan. Time would purchase Warner and  in the process would take on about $9 billion in new debt.  </P> <P> At the time, the newly formulated merger looked like an ingenious solution.  Sure, Time shareholders wouldn't get the $200 a share that Paramount was  offering.  </P> <P> But they'd get a stake in a company that, once Time Warner got going, could set  the entertainment world on fire. And besides, people associated with the  combination were whispering to Wall Street and to the press, Time Warner's  stock would probably sell for a very respectable $130 a share right from the  start.  </P> <P> These proponents of the deal were correct -- for a while. Time Warner's stock  peaked at about $145 shortly after the deal was completed late last year.  </P> <P> But its price last week was just $99, and even that was a $10-a-share  improvement over what the stock had sold for earlier this year.  </P> <P> "I didn't think it would get this low," said Edward Atorino, an analyst with  Salomon Bros. "Strategically, it's a sound concept. However, from a short-term  perspective, it's a significant disappointment for the shareholder."  </P> <P> "Significant disappointment" is right. In fact, arbitragers on Wall Street  still contend that Time's decision not to negotiate with Paramount may have  been the biggest blunder in the history of the takeover business. They say  without much prodding, Paramount probably would have raised its bid by $25 a  share to $225.  </P> <P> And, the arbs claim, it will be a long time before the stock of the new Time  Warner ever reaches that lofty level.  </P> <P> A significant rise in the price of the stock will be particularly difficult  because of losses that the company will likely report for several years. In the  fourth quarter of 1989 alone, the company had a deficit of $222 million. The  loss was almost entirely because of interest owed on the money borrowed to buy  Warner.  </P> <P> "I don't have them in the black until 1993," said James Goss, an analyst at  Duff &amp; Phelps.  </P> <P> The losses were expected. Before completion of the merger, Time Warner's  boosters were telling people to ignore the bottom line.  </P> <P> Instead, they were saying, look at the company's wonderful cash flow. The new  company's properties -- which include major magazines such as Time, People,  Money and Sports Illustrated; its cable television system, with more than 5.5  million subscribers, and its film, record and publishing operations -- would  add up to a media marvel that could generate a wonderful pile of cash.  </P> <P> But even before Time finished buying Warner, Wall Street started to have a  change of heart about cash flow as the basis for an acquisition. As corporate  earnings in general started to deteriorate last fall, investors again began  looking at a company's profits. And Time Warner didn't have any.  </P> <P> Kenneth Hackel, head of Cash Flow Investors and the guru of that type of  investing, said the problem isn't that Wall Street doesn't understand Time  Warner's ability to generate cash. Hackel believes that Wall Street understands  all too well that Time Warner doesn't have any spare -- or free -- cash flow  after it pays its bills.  </P> <P> "There's a big difference between cash flow and free cash flow," contended  Hackel. "At the current rate of free cash flow, it would take 50 years to pay  off debt."  </P> <P> Hackel believes that Time Warner's stock is worth only $70 to $75 on the basis  of its free -- or discretionary -- cash flow.  </P> <P> "It's right back to square one," said Salomon's Atorino.  </P> <P> Time's shareholders would probably be more than happy to get back to the  starting point; right before the Warner merger was announced, the company's  stock was worth more than $109 a share.  </P> <P> But cash flow isn't the only thing bothering Time Warner followers on Wall  Street. A move in Washington to reregulate cable television has depressed all  cable-TV stocks, which were also rocked a few weeks ago by the announcement  that NBC, News Corp., Cablevision and the Hughes division of General Motors are  developing a direct broadcast system to compete with cable television.  </P> <P> "A lot has changed in the last six months," said J. Kendrick Noble of Paine  Webber. But "long term, we haven't changed our mind. We think (Time Warner) is  a good deal."  </P> <P> Added longtime entertainment industry watcher John Reidy, "I continue to  believe that if (Time Warner) produces the cash flow, this stock should be in  the $140 to $150 range within a year."  </P> <P> On the first anniversary of the Time Warner deal, however, Noble and Reidy seem  to be in the minority with their optimism. The vast majority of Time's original  shareholders won't be celebrating. They'll just be thinking of that $200 a  share they didn't get.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Speaking Volumes -- Without a Conclusion  </P> <P> Keep an eye on trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange and you'll know  what stock prices will do.  </P> <P> That's the advice a lot of old-timers on Wall Street give. One old saying is  that you can't have a bull market unless volume rises. Without the herd,  there's no bull. Another favorite is that the best indication of a bear market  is a pickup in trading volume as prices are declining.  </P> <P> When you apply both maxims to recent trading patterns, you could conclude that  the stock market is going neither higher, nor lower, with any great conviction.  It can't be a bull market, the old-timers say, because there isn't enough  volume. And it can't be a bear market because there wasn't enough volume when  prices were falling in January and February.  </P> <P> It may be time to get rid of old sayings, or at least modernize them.  </P> <P> Daily trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange averaged 155.9 million  shares last month, down from 172.5 million in January. Trading in January and  February was only moderately active -- no cause for alarm for either the bulls  or the bears.  </P> <P> But some experts think that market watchers should shift their focus from New  York to Chicago, where stock index futures contracts have traded with a  vengeance since the start of 1990. Traders at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange  say, for example, that they've been much busier than their brethren on the  NYSE.  </P> <P> The statistics seem to bear that out. More than 1.1 million Standard &amp;  Poor's 500-stock index futures contracts were trading on the Merc in January.  That was up sharply from December's 811,000 contracts and much higher than the  862,000 contracts traded in January, 1989. On the NYSE, meanwhile, trading  volume in stocks was more or less comparable to that of a year ago.  </P> <P> Nobody is quite sure what effect an acceleration in trading volume in stock  index futures contracts will have on the market as a whole. And people are even  less certain about the correlation between increased trading in the stock index  contracts and the prospects for a bull or bear market.  </P> <P> But here is a theory.  </P> <P> "If you believe the two markets are linked and one market is showing greater  volume, and it's going in one direction, it's going to pull the other market,"  said a top trader for one investment firm.  </P> <P> In other words, the increased trading volume in stock index futures contracts  in January and February, when prices were declining, could have been the signal  that Wall Street has a bear on its hands.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not Much Witchcraft on Expiration Days  </P> <P> In what may come as a big surprise to even the casual observer of the stock  market's "triple witching hours," a study by two university professors that was  supported by a grant from the American Stock Exchange and the Chicago Board  Options Exchange concludes that trading volatility on options expiration days  is "much ado about (nearly) nothing."  </P> <P> The study, which was recently released by Hans Stoll, a finance professor at  Vanderbilt University, and Robert E. Whaley, who holds a similar post at Duke  University, says the effects of index options and index futures on expiration  days is "quite small."  </P> <P> "It's small in the sense that it's not very different from the price effects  you have on any given stock on any given day," Stoll said. He admits that there  have been occasional times -- especially during the "triple witching" days when  stock index options, index futures and regular stock options expire all at once  -- that price volatility has been large.  </P> <P> "But even on the quarterly expirations, the average fluctuation is not very  large and has declined in recent periods," Stoll said. When only index options  and regular stock options expire on the third Friday of each month, the effect  on stock prices has always been small, he said.  </P> <P> Remember that on March 16, the next time that stock index options, index  futures and regular stock options expire simultaneously.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Tallinn, Apr 22, BNS -- Estonian Defense  Minister Indrek Kannik ended today his official visit to  Ukraine. During the visit Kannik and his Ukrainian counterpart,  Gen. Vitaliy Radetskyy, signed an agreement on cooperation  between the two countries' defense ministries. Kannik invited  Radetskyy for a visit to Estonia.    Kannik told BNS today Ukraine's independence means also  Estonia's independence. He said the relations between the two  countries are steadily improving.    "Estonian-Ukrainian relations are reaching the stage of  concrete cooperation," Kannik said. "The questions of possible  weapons purchases will be solved on the expert level. We are  very much interested in the agreement on conventional arms  reduction Ukraine has signed," the defense minister told BNS.    "The Estonian-Russian and Ukrainian-Russian relations have  reached very delicate dimensions, so we need one another all the  more," the minister claimed.    The agreement Kannik and Radetskyy signed on April 20 is a  framework agreement that maps out different opportunities for  cooperation in the defense sphere, including consultations on  the formation and financing of defense forces and joint action  within NATO's Partnership for Peace program.    Other issues discussed at the meeting of the defense  ministers included international peacekeeping operations, the  state of Estonian-Russian and Ukrainian-Russian relations,  division of the former Soviet Black Sea Fleet, and tensions  around the Crimean peninsula.    The Ukrainian defense minister told BNS Russian troops must  leave Estonia by the proposed withdrawal deadline of Aug. 31,  1994. "Russian military bases on your territory are your  domestic affair and the decision whether to retain them is up to  you," he noted. Radetskyy did not support granting Russian  military retirees a special status in Estonia. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> November 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EAST GERMANY OPENS THE BERLIN WALL  </P> <P> Your Nov. 10 headline "East Germany Opens Borders" was electrifying despite the  other stunning news in the Eastern Bloc countries.  </P> <P> Who would have expected all these changes to take place in our lifetime? Some  of us even thought that it would take a world war to bring about these  upheavals.  </P> <P> Now instead of stockpiling our nuclear arsenals we should devote our energy and  resources to combatting crimes, eradicating drugs, perfecting our means of  production and developing the system that can enhance the quality of life in  this planet.  </P> <P> MEL RED RECANA, Municipal Court Judge, Los Angeles  </P></p>

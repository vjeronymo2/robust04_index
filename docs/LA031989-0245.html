			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUILDER HELPS EFFORTS AT CONSERVATION  </P> <P> As California nears the end of its third year of below-average precipitation,  at least one builder is doing something about conserving water.  </P> <P> Cambridge Development commissioned landscape designer Betty Jo McDonald to use  drought-tolerant landscaping for the four model homes in the builder's  Cambridge Chaparral tract on Challenger Way in Lancaster.  </P> <P> Kathy Butcher, Cambridge marketing director who came up with the idea, said the  commission -- is believed to be California's first model compound featuring  such water conserving landscaping.  </P> <P> The production homes in the 144-unit development will also come with modified  drought-tolerant front landscaping. Prices for the 3- and 4-bedroom  single-family houses range from $120,000 to $150,000.  </P></p>

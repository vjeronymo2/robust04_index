			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Scots investment at 13-year peak Scotland had an outstandingly successful year in securing inward-investment projects during 1993-94, Locate in Scotland, the inward-investment bureau, said yesterday. Its annual report, published yesterday, showed that 95 inward-investment projects were committed to Scotland, the highest number since 1981. Total investment of Pounds 587m was planned, which would create 7,688 jobs and safeguard a further 3,384 jobs. This compares with investment of Pounds 352m secured in 1992-93, which involved 65 projects and created or safeguarded more than 8,000 jobs. Mr Allan Stewart, Scottish Office industry minister, warmly welcomed the figures, but the Scottish Office said: 'Not all projects proceed exactly as planned. On average around two-thirds of planned direct jobs are achieved.' Last year's performance will help rebut sceptics who have argued that Scotland is declining as a magnet for inward investment in face of competition from the Irish republic, Spain and eastern Europe. Some 62 per cent of the total planned investment for 1993-94 comes from the US, and of that, 85 per cent was reinvestment in existing plants, such as a Pounds 7m expansion by the computer manufacturer Compaq, creating a further 250 jobs. Some 22 per cent of new investment came from continental Europe and Scandinavia, 11 per cent from the rest of the UK and 4 per cent from Japan and Asia. Almost half of all new investment was in the electronics sector, followed by chemicals and engineering. Locate in Scotland: Review 1993-94.

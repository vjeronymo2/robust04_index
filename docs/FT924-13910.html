			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Lucas to lose 4,000 jobs in shake-up LUCAS Industries, one of the UK's largest engineering groups, is shedding at least 4,000 jobs in a three-year restructuring programme. It will sell companies which are not central to its aerospace and automotive business and move its manufacturing operations on to fewer sites. To pay for the restructuring, the group made a provision of Pounds 88.4m in its 1991-92 results. The figures, announced yesterday, showed a sharp reduction in pre-tax profits to Pounds 22.5m from Pounds 82.8m in the year to July 1991, and a net loss of Pounds 8.8m compared with a net profit of Pounds 49.4m last time. Lucas had a loss per share of 1.2p, against earnings per share of 7.1p a year earlier. The performance came as no surprise to the stock market which was heartened by the maintenance of the dividend at 7p a share. The share price quickly climbed 10p before settling to close at 94p for a day's rise of 4p. This gave Lucas a market value of nearly Pounds 660m. Lucas started its restructuring programme earlier this year. It has already reduced its workforce by 1,250. The remaining 2,750 jobs will be lost, roughly evenly, between the UK and overseas, taking the total number of people employed worldwide by the group to around 47,000 from more than 57,000 in July, 1990. Sir Anthony Gill, chairman, warned that the first half of the current year will be little better than the 1991-92 first half, when Lucas had pre-tax profits of Pounds 200,000 topped up by a Pounds 90m contribution from its pension fund. The pension fund contribution is offsetting the future cost of the restructuring programme. In 1991-92 Lucas had in any case paid Pounds 23.7m in redundancy and reorganisation costs. These sliced into trading profits and left operating profits at Pounds 58.3m, half the previous year, but earned on sales 5 per cent down at Pounds 2.37bn. Lucas found all its aerospace markets weaker: operating profits were reduced in the UK while losses were incurred in North America and continental Europe. By comparison, its automotive business had a glittering year. Operating profits at Pounds 38.6m nearly reached the level of the previous year and sharply higher profits in continental Europe more than offset losses in the UK and North America.

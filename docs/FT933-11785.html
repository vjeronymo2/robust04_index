			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Brooke presses on with lottery work MR PETER Brooke, the national heritage secretary, promised yesterday that work on the national lottery would continue, in spite of the failure to get royal assent for the National Lottery Bill before the parliamentary recess. He expected a regulatory adviser, who would in effect be the director-general designate of the Office of the National Lottery, would be announced shortly. Mr Brooke said work would continue on preparing invitations to tender for the lottery and on creating the selection process for the National Lottery operator.</p>

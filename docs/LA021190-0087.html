			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE: HYPE ATTACK:  </P> <P> Our Jose Canseco 900 Rip-Off Award goes to David Bowie, who recently announced  a 1990 "Retrospective" World Tour, which kicks off March 3 in Quebec and  (surely by coincidence) coincides with the release of his digitally remastered  catalogue of albums. The gimmick: Each concert will be an all-request affair,  with Bowie performing songs chosen by his fans.  </P> <P> Of course, to vote your favorites, you have to dial a 900 number (that's $2 for  the first minute, kids, $1.50 for each additional minute), which leisurely  touts various contests and prizes aimed at keeping fans on the line for as long  as possible. . . . Rap hotshot M.C. Hammer's new album, "Please Hammer Don't  Hurt 'Em," is due later this month from Capitol Records. It features rap-style  covers of the Jacksons' "Dancing Machine" and the Chi-Lites' "Have You Seen  Her," plus a song called "U Can't Touch This" that borrows heavily from the  main riff of Rick James' "Super Freak." Hammer's new single, "Help the  Children," also incorporates parts of Marvin Gaye's "Mercy Mercy Me."  </P></p>

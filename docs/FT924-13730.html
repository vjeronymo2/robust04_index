			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Fast growth for niche technology / A look at the development of industrial inkjet printing LINX PRINTING Technologies, a fast growing company nurtured in the technologically fertile Cambridgeshire fenlands, comes to the stock market this week in a move which underlines UK domination of the industrial continuous inkjet printing business. While nothing can be taken for granted in the present economic climate, the company is expected to have a market value of between Pounds 20m and Pounds 30m when the shares are priced tomorrow. Linx is a new star in a fast developing market. Worth about Pounds 220m a year at present, analysts reckon the industrial inkjet market will continue to grow by between 10 per cent and 15 per cent a year for the next few years. That represents a significant reduction in growth from the exuberant rates over the past decade as sales generated by consumer legislation in the European Community level off. The market leaders are actively seeking to open up new applications and other technologies such as lasers for high speed printing to sustain growth and profitability. Market leadership is shared between Domino Printing Sciences, another Cambridgeshire company, and Videojet, based in the US but owned by GEC of the UK. Each company has about 27 per cent of worldwide sales and dominates its local market. A French company, Imaje, is number three with 17 per cent. Industrial inkjet printing is a niche technology which has so far escaped the attentions of the big battalions of the electronics industry. It calls for a complex mix of skills. The leaders in the industry combine engineering and electronics expertise with enough scientific knowledge to understand the physics of electronically charged ink droplets in motion and the chemical skills to cook up a menu of specialised, sometimes edible, inks. Among the large electronics companies only Hitachi of Japan with a 9 per cent market share has made much of an impact. 'It is a sleeping giant that so far has not woken up,' says Mr Howard Whitesmith, Domino's managing director. The principles behind inkjet printing have been known for over a hundred years, but it was modern legislation which provided the impetus to turn a laboratory curiosity into a profitable business. Today's industry grew out of research at the high technology consultants Cambridge Consultants (CCL) in the UK and Stanford University in the US. In 1976 Stanford designed the first commercial inkjet printer for the US office supplier AB Dick, now a subsidiary of GEC, which led eventually to the formation of Videojet. Cambridge Consultants had been experimenting with similar systems and in 1978, Mr Graeme Minto, CCL's inkjet team leader, left the consultancy and established Domino to exploit the technology. The fledgling company was given a powerful boost in 1981 by European Community legislation which required perishable goods to be printed with a 'best before' date. Only inkjet printing could offer the combination of speed, flexibility and reliability required. In 1980, Domino incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 69,000 on sales of Pounds 82,000. By 1984, it was ready to go public with pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.8m on sales of Pounds 7.4m. Last year, it made profits of Pounds 9m on a turnover of Pounds 60m. Industrial inkjet printers of the kind made by Domino and Videojet are markedly different from the office inkjet machines now common throughout the world. Compared to their industrial counterparts, office printers are slow and finicky. The geometrical relationship between the print head of an office printer and the paper has to be exact; fast drying inks cannot be used because of the dangers of clogging. Their life on a production line could be measured in hours rather than days. Industrial inkjets, on the other hand, are designed for the rigours of the factor floor. They can tolerate distances of several centimetres between the print head and the target. A stream of fast moving, jostling, mineral water cans gives them no problems; neither do delicate objects like eggs or wine bottles. They will print in any direction and on virtually any surface from a breeze block to a shiny plastic cable cover. Superquick drying or food grade inks are often the rule rather than the exception. What makes inkjet printing possible is the speed of modern microprocessors. A stream of charged ink drops, 60 millionths of a metre in diameter - about the thickness of a human hair - is ejected continuously from the print head. Up to 128,000 drops are ejected every second. The technology makes it possible to print variable information at rates which match the speed of modern production lines without contact. Domino now makes about 600 machines a months with an average selling price of Pounds 6,000. Three-quarters of its systems are sold outside the UK and it won the Queen's Award for Export in 1987 and 1992. This year the Royal Mail announced it would buy 500 Domino printers over three years in one of the largest orders of its kind. The world of inkjet printing is small and incestuous. Linx, a brasher, more publicity-conscious company than Domino, was formed in 1987 by Mr Mike Keeling and Mr Hill Weinberg, both also former employees of CCL. Helped by a 1991 European Community directive which demands that all consumables are marked either with a sell by date or a lot number, Linx has grown by from a turnover of Pounds 152,000 and operating loss of Pounds 496,000 in 1988 to sales of Pounds 6.5m and operating profits of more than Pounds 900,000 in 1991. It too was awarded the Queen's Award for Export in 1992. Domino and Linx are conscious that the market driven by EC legislation is now mature and although similar moves are taking place in other countries, they are nevertheless seeking new ways of sustaining growth. Mr Whitesmith says that sales are roughly divided between legislation-driven markets and new areas - this includes, for example, personalising or printing unique numbers on individual copies of newspapers and magazines. Mr Whitesmith relishes his story of supplying the late Mr Robert Maxwell with Domino equipment to print 'bingo' competition numbers on individual copies of the Daily Mirror - and getting paid before Mr Maxwell's house of cards collapsed. He has already diversified into 'Packtrack', a mimeographic carton marking technology it acquired in a takeover, and is researching a new inkjet technology which within five years could combine the quality of office inkjet printing with the speed and reliability of industrial systems.</p>

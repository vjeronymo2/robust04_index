Income tax revenues totaled 786 million lempiras; the  property tax accounted for 26 million lempiras; 1.002 billion  lempiras was collected for the tax on production, consumption,  and sales; import duties amounted to 877 million lempiras; and  service fees accounted for 109 million lempiras.    The official stated that although the figures are not  comparable to those of the previous year because the entire  general budget would have to be analyzed for that, they do  amount to 333.2 million lempiras more as of the end of October.    Chong Wong noted that "we are meeting the collection  targets"  set for this fiscal year, even though the share revaluation tax  has not yet been paid; it is expected to yield another 100  million lempiras.    He complained that Hondurans are paying scant attention to  this new tax, leaving everything to the last minute. The  deadline for submitting applications is 30 November, and  payments are due no later than 15 December, with no extensions.    So far, however, only 25 million lempiras has been collected  on this tax.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, April 25 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill  Clinton promised today to find why two U.S. jets accidentally  shot down two allied helicopters, killing 26 people from the  U.S. and other countries.    "No one's words can wipe away the grief, the pain, the  questions" of the victims' families, Clinton said in a memorial  service. "It is our duty... [ellipses as received] to find the  answers which they rightfully seek."    Secretary of Defense William Perry and Chairman of Joint  Chiefs of Staff John Shalikashvili also attended the service,  praising the victims' contributions "to the Kurdish people of  northern Iraq, to each of us here."    The 26 victims, 15 of them U.S. citizens, perished April 14  when two U.S. F-15C fighter planes accidentally shot down two  UH-60 Black Hawk Helicopters over northern Iraq.    The toll also included three Turkish officers, one French  officer, two British officers and five Kurdish passengers aboard  the two helicopters.    Perry appointed an investigative board to look into the  incident soon after.    No final results were released but reports said the  "identification friend or foe" system of the two helicopters  might be turned off.    But one official described the findings as preliminary,  saying the crashes' impact might have jarred the switches from  "on" to "off," the WASHINGTON TIMES reported last Thursday [21  April].    THE TIMES said if the helicopters had been flying through  the  no- fly zone with the identification system shut off, it would  explain why AWACS [airborne warning and control system]  surveillance aircraft got no response from the helicopters when  it electronically queried them shortly before the F-15C jets  fired missiles on them.</p>

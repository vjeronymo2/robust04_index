			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [All Sudanese place-names as published] </F>   [Text] Some Arab and Western capitals are following with  great interest the trend within the Sudanese Government to grant  Sudanese citizenship to any Muslim, since this is considered a  first of its kind by a government since the naturalization law  was created.    Diplomatic sources in Cairo noted that the Khartoum  government intends to pass a new draft law on naturalization.  This law stipulates granting Sudanese citizenship to every  Muslim this coming month. The sources added that if this  happens, large numbers of extremist terrorists will find shelter  and a land to use as a springboard for their terrorist  activities.    It is worth noting here that the current naturalization law  stipulates that the applicant for citizenship must have resided  in Sudan for not less than 12 years and should not have a  criminal record of a crime that violates security and honor.    These diplomatic sources noted that there are more than  5,000  men and women extremist Muslims residing in Sudan. Most of them  are from Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Palestine.  The number of Islamists from Morocco known to these sources is  50. There are over 370 Egyptians known by their "code"  [preceding word in English] names. There are also over 300  Tunisians who belong to the Ennahda Movement headed by Rachid  Ghanouchi.    These sources noted that among these groups, there are some  Syrians, Iraqis, and Yemenis who live in Sudan under the cover  of being businessmen and contractors. Most of these Islamists  live in the areas of al-Riyad, al-Ta'if, al-Manshiyah, Kawbar,  and Madinat al-Mughtaribin in Madinat al-Khartoum Bahri.</p>

			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / The Markets: Cloudy picture for US economy - Global Investor If the events of the past week are anything to go by, US economists will have to adjust the statistics for early 1994 not just for the effects of earthquake, flood and freeze, but also for plagues of locusts and outbreaks of boils. We will know on Friday, when the advance GDP estimates are published, if the US economy was really growing at 6 per cent in the closing months of 1993, as the White House and the US Treasury have been predicting. But the geological and meteorological events of recent weeks mean that we don't really have much idea about what the numbers will be for the first quarter of 1994. Locust-adjusted, the US economy is probably still careering along. Mark Turner, who runs Putnam Investments' global fixed income funds from Boston, offers one of those anecdotes which are always far more compelling than the dry statistics. When he started to renovate his house a few months ago, he says, his builder had a so-so order book. Now, it's completely filled for the next four years, with a mixture of residential and commercial work. 'Boston was first into the real-estate slump, and it will probably be the first out,' says Mr Turner. That means you can't necessarily generalise to other parts of the country. But still, the tale is another piece of evidence about the scale of the US recovery. In manufacturing, for example, we could well discover this spring - divine afflictions permitting - that the US has enjoyed six months of industrial output growing at an annual rate of over 10 per cent. General Electric, perhaps the most diversified of big US companies, reported fourth-quarter earnings from continuing businesses up 22 per cent over the same period the year before. Despite all this growth, there seems no sign yet of inflationary pressures. Wait till the second half of the year, says Mr Turner's colleague Jonathan Francis, Putnam's global strategist: 'That's when the chickens are going to come home to roost.' GDP growth will slow, perhaps to around 2 1/2 -3 per cent. Productivity growth, which has been swamping any wage pressures, will disappear. And after the sharp rise in output of the early part of the year, capacity utilisation will be around the 85 per cent level, the point at which upward pressure on costs and prices usually starts to appear. 'If we're going to see an inflationary threat, it's going to be in the second half of the year,' said Mr Turner. Note that 'if'. It is what distinguishes this bond market rally from its predecessors. At this point in any previous cycle - in recent memory, at least - there would have been no 'if' about it. By now, inflationary momentum would be irresistible. This time, the bond market cannot make up its mind. Back to 1894 One reason for this uncertainty, touched on in last week's column, is the debate over the impact of 'globalisation' of markets on the developed economies. At a micro level, the shift of manufacturing to south-east Asia and (to a lesser extent) to Latin America, promises all sorts of disruptions to western financial markets - to corporate bond markets just as much as to equities. At a macro level, though, the rapid growth of the non-OECD world could bring unalloyed benefits. That, at least, is the conclusion reached by Sushil Wadhwani and Mustaq Shah of Goldman Sachs in a recent paper*. As part of their argument, they return to the period that exercises a morbid fascination for British economic historians: the years between 1870 (when Britain produced roughly a third of world industrial output) and 1914 (when the UK share had fallen to only 14 per cent). In the same years, the US share rose from around 23 per cent to 36 per cent. For much of the period, the general price level fell in the UK. This, say the authors 'is consistent with the notion of global competition exerting a deflationary impact', though they accept that other factors may also have been at work, including the behaviour of the money supply. Throughout those years, bond yields were on a long-run down-trend, and UK productivity growth lagged behind that in Germany and the US. The striking thing, however, is that Britain's overall economic growth rate was not significantly slower, at around 2 per cent, than in much of the earlier part of the century. And in the last quarter of the 19th century, UK equities provided a real return of over 8 per cent a year, a high figure by any standards. Of course, at the turn of the century the UK equity market remained undeveloped, with many big companies in family hands. Still, assuming that these figures are representative, they lead the Goldman economists to a number of interesting conclusions: Fast growth in the rest of the world does not rule out acceptable growth in mature economies. Global competition may indeed hold down developed-country inflation, creating an attractive long-run environment for bonds. Equities may continue to outperform fixed-income investments, though not by as much as is usual. And though developing economies may in general provide better returns, there will be periods when OECD stock markets do better. Plumbers A clutch of product announcements from Hewlett-Packard last week symbolised the way in which the computer industry's old conventional wisdom is dying. The old wisdom said that mainframes, minicomputers and workstations, though undermined by personal computers, would retain important for serious applications, the ones that keep a business going. Big computer companies would have to slim down, but they could retain their existing business model (lavish sales staff, lots of hand-holding, high gross margins). That belief, already sickly, will finally succumb in 1994. Last week HP launched powerful new workstations and 'business servers' which are replacements, in effect, for old-style minicomputers, themselves replacements for old-style mainframes. HP's new machines perfectly illustrate the trend. The most significant numbers about them are not the 16Mb or 60MHz that litter the HP releases; they're the Dollars 3,995 price for the workstation. Not only is that dangerously cheap, comparable with top-of-the-line PCs - it's also consumer-style pricing, sneaking in just under the thousand dollar mark. That's it, guys: once that shift happens, the old comfortable business-to-business certainties go out of the window. And so does the gross margin. You knew all this? All right, but did you realise just what was happening to the new conventional wisdom, too? People who long ago wrote off the mainframe have been talking excitedly about 'the coming OS wars', the looming battle between various new operating systems for desktop computers - one from Microsoft, one from Apple and IBM, one from Novell, and so on. One of these would take over from Microsoft's MS-Dos, the current industry standard. Which was it to be? In truth, since the operating system does a computer's most boring housekeeping tasks, anyone who could get excited about OS wars would probably love a TV show called Battle of the Sanitary Engineers. It's all beside the point, anyway. HP also announced last week that its new computers, though they have their own operating system, would also be able to run any program written for Microsoft's Windows, the visual front end to MS-Dos. Other companies have already pulled off the same trick. Windows has, in effect, replaced MS-Dos as the world's standard, and the OS wars are irrelevant. Conclusions: 1. Microsoft's Bill Gates has done it again. 2. Only computer companies that, like HP, have adapted to the new world can hope to survive. 3. If the prices in any industry suddenly shift from figures ending in zero to ones ending in 95 or 99, watch out for companies whose cost structure and volumes can't make the shift, too. *Emerging Giants, Globalisation and Equities, Goldman Sachs International, London, January 19 1994  ---------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL RETURN IN LOCAL CURRENCY TO 20/1/94  ----------------------------------------------------------------                        percentage change over period                 US    Japan   Germany   France    Italy     UK  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Cash  ----------------------------------------------------------------  Week         0.06     0.05      0.12     0.13     0.16    0.10  Month        0.27     0.20      0.55     0.57     0.71    0.48  Year         3.69     3.41      7.38     9.31    12.13    6.56  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 3-5 year  ----------------------------------------------------------------  Week         0.29    -0.97     -0.04     0.03     0.38    0.62 Month         1.14    -1.18      0.39     0.70     1.04    0.61 Year          9.28     9.07     12.32    17.32    27.12   13.15  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 7-10 year  ----------------------------------------------------------------  Week         0.23    -2.27     -0.29     0.12     0.76    1.15  Month        1.61    -2.05      0.32     1.02     1.26    0.99  Year        13.38    11.85     15.84    23.04    38.54   21.34  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Equities  ----------------------------------------------------------------  Week          0.5      3.3      -1.9      0.5      1.5     3.7  Month         2.0      6.9      -2.6      3.5     -0.1     4.7  Year         12.0     23.8      35.7     34.2     32.7    33.7  ----------------------------------------------------------------  ---------------------------------------------------------------- BEST PERFORMING STOCKS FROM FT-A WORLD INDICES IN LOCAL CURRENCY TO 20/1/94  ----------------------------------------------------------------                                      percentage change                                Close    Week    Month    Year  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Spring Ram (UK)                76.00    39.4     55.1   -36.1 Sarrio (Spain)                460.00    29.6     18.9    35.3 Bouganville Copper (Aus)        1.10    29.4     71.9   189.5 NL Industries (USA)             6.25    27.5      8.5    18.6 Jardine Strategic (HK)         36.20    23.7     11.5    66.3 Jardine Matheson (HK)          78.00    21.9      6.1    69.6 Hutchison Whampoa (HK)         37.75    21.8     -2.6   127.4 Taylor Woodrow (UK)           181.00    20.7     32.1   154.9 Guoco Group Ltd (HK)           41.75    19.3      0.6   165.9 Henderson Investment (HK)       8.15    18.1      9.4   128.0  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Cash &amp; Bonds - Lehman Brothers.

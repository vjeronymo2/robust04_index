			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A TAPESTRY OF LEARNING;  </P> <P> LIVES ON THE BOUNDARY;  </P> <P> THE STRUGGLES AND ACHIEVEMENTS OF AMERICA'S UNDERPREPARED BY MIKE ROSE (THE  FREE PRESS: $22.95; 254 PP.; 0-02926821-4)  </P> <P> Unlike those who rebuke without offering solutions, Mike Rose produces a  statement of hope in "Lives on the Boundary." Rose weaves a tapestry, gleaning  from his own learning experiences and those of other's whose lives have  intersected his.  </P> <P> Rose, associate director of the UCLA writing program, describes his book as  "vignette and commentary, reflection and analysis." It is an "engagement with  language," an examination of people who have been labeled failures, an  exploration of the process becoming literate, and a rite of passage for Rose  himself into the academic world.  </P> <P> Rose immediately confronts the "back to basics" cry for a return to drills on  parts of speech, grammar rules, spelling and diagraming sentences. The  landscapes of Rose's education intermingle with scenes of people and places in  his response to education fundamentalists. There are scenes of the deprived, of  "information poverty," of struggles and anger, and finally, of great hope.  </P> <P> Rose came to Los Angeles with his Italian immigrant parents in the early '50s.  He moved into an impoverished neighborhood in South- Central Los Angeles. Woven  into this tapestry are vivid, yet dreary, scenes of the neighborhood and Roses'  family life. His education was as bleak as the neighborhood. He was stuck in a  vocational track throughout his parochial school until an insightful teacher  recognized potential where others had only seen deficiencies.  </P> <P> Rose chronicles his discovery of classic literature and critical/analytical  communication which lead him from the grim boundaries of his neighborhood to  Loyola University. His journey continued to UCLA graduate school and then on to  the Teacher Corps in the housing projects of east Los Angeles County. Along the  journey are encounters with professors, master teachers and students --  children of migrant farm workers, Vietnamese veterans, and underprepared  college freshmen.  </P> <P> With these students Rose shares harbored feelings of being out of his league  and of "dreary impotence." Yet, throughout his story, the evidence of  deficiency is not that of the students, but of the American education system.  According to Rose, in an effort to tailor instruction and guarantee the  democratic right of education for all, educators "frequently slot rather than  shape, categorize rather than foster," a judgment of ability which, accurate or  not, has affected the curriculum these students have received. Hope is evident  in the lives of the students, such as the veterans who wanted to change their  lives. Rose recognized that despite their earlier failures, they still held  onto an American dream: "Education held the power to equalize things."  </P> <P> As for the solution, Rose immersed his students in talking, reading and writing  toward the development of critical thinking. Through these case studies, Rose  continually challenges "the assumption that error can be eradicated by zeroing  in on the particulars of language . . . and that grammatical error signals some  fundamental mental barrier."  </P> <P> Rose re-entered the university "with some responsibility for making it work . .  . to see beyond failure . . . (and) develop perception." He challenges the  politics of academia and presents a "forceful call" to those who teach to  encourage performance; to "engage books and ideas thought to be beyond (the)  grasp (of students)"; to recognize that "error marks the place where education  begins," rather than diagnosing the error as an illness and attempting to  provide a remedy with corrective teaching. Rose cautions all, "How much we  don't see when we look only for deficiency, when we tally up all that people  can't do."  </P> <P> As I began reading "Lives," I wondered who was the intended audience. Then as I  traveled along with Rose on his journeys, my own doubts of ability as an  undergraduate college student and my love for the "masters" in literature were  resurrected. I felt concerns for my children's education and recognized my  parental responsibility toward their learning. I was inspired as a "teacher" to  tap the dreams of the "functionally illiterate" with whom my life intersects  daily. And like Rose, I was reminded that as we teach, so we learn.  </P> <P> As a personal rite of passage, "Lives" is a vindication from the  "powerlessness" of Rose's childhood to his right to cross those boundaries into  the academic world. He is critical of the "publish or perish" attitude within  the university. Ironically, his driving force to publish this book signifies a  rite of passage within the university system. He champions this right for  others, and he challenges universities to recognize the potential of the  "so-called" educationally impoverished. "Lives" is a mirror to the many lacking  perfect grammar and spelling, who may see their dreams translated into reality  after all.  </P></p>

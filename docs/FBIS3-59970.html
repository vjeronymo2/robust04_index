Brigadier General Carlos Grigoletto Cortijo, commander of  the  5th Jungle Infantry Division, said that this operation was  supported by the authorities and campesino communities in the  area.    He added that more than 20 people were arrested and that so  far 28 maceration pits built close to the plantations have been  destroyed in the provinces of Bagua and Condorcanqui. He  indicated that an important volume of precursors for the  production of drugs was also seized.    Grigoletto Cortijo stated that 500 hectares of coca  plantations were destroyed in the Santa Maria de Nieva area.  Local residents have reported that there are more coca  plantations further up the Nieva River. This region can be  reached by motor boats and other types of transportation.    He indicated that the strong pressure against traffickers in  the Central Huallaga area has caused many of them to move to El  Muyo, Miramar, Salinas, Montenegro, Chiriaco, and Santa Maria de  Nieva in the provinces of Bagua and Condorcanqu, where they have  planted coca and constructed maceration pits.    Grigoletto Cortijo said there are many native communities in  those areas and the chiefs of these communities are persuaded to  support the planting of coca. ``The large sums of money paid by  the traffickers convinces many of the chiefs to support the  planting of coca in their territories.''</p>

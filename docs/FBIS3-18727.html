			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Claude Lorieux: "Saddam's Emissary in Paris"] </F>   [Text] The UN resolutions do not prohibit talks, so people  are talking. Riyad al-Qaysi, director at the Iraqi Foreign  Ministry, visited the French Foreign Ministry yesterday. He  already has visited it once before, a few months ago. In  addition, a Baghdad oil official was the guest of Elf and Total  last week.    France, with its high unemployment, is finding it  increasingly difficult to live with the trade embargo imposed on  Iraq since it invaded Kuwait in August 1990. The embargo is  denying our exporters access to a large and creditworthy market  (18 million inhabitants). France is not the only country  experiencing these problems. With regard to this issue, which  Washington is watching closely, Paris wants its policy to be  "transparent." It expects Saddam Husayn to respect "the  resolutions and nothing but the resolutions." Speaking on  Wednesday [2 March] about the "progress" made by Iraq, [French  Foreign Minister] Alain Juppe indicated that, if it is confirmed  that Baghdad no longer has any weapons of mass destruction, we  can authorize it to export its oil. Along with other countries,  including Great Britain, France does not want the United Nations  to invent fresh obstacles each time Iraq overcomes one of the  previous hurdles placed in its path. Many Arab and Western  diplomats suspect the White House of encouraging this practice.  An "Iraqi lobby" accompanied -- or encouraged -- France's  unilateral action of supporting Baghdad throughout the  Iranian-Iraqi war. This lobby has now "reawakened." Some of  its members dream of a government daring to "reinstall" them on  the Iraqi market: Iraq has the Middle East's second largest oil  reserves. Alain Juppe wants to respect "UN legality." It is  said that he will insist on this point during the term of the  French UN Security Council presidency.    However, the increasingly tight grip being exerted by the  United States on the Gulf monarchies and the disappointment of  our exporters in Saudi Arabia (most recently the "political"  failure of Airbus in the face of competition from Boeing) will  only serve to push French -- and European -- leaders to look  elsewhere, even if they will not condemn the sanctions before  their reason for being has disappeared.</p>

			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Waterford Wedgwood cuts jobs THE TROUBLED Waterford Wedgwood group, is planning to cut the workforce at its loss-making Waterford plant in Ireland by a further 25 per cent in an effort to bring the group back to profitability, it was revealed in Dublin yesterday. Mr Paddy Galvin, chief executive of the Waterford Crystal arm of the business, in a bleak message to union leaders last week said that 550 redundancies will be required at the Waterford plant, or else they must face the possibility of its closure. Company executives are remaining tight-lipped over the redundancy plans, acknowledging only that Mr Galvin met with union leaders last Thursday 'to give them a full update on the situation in the company', but more details will apparently be released later this week. Union officials said yesterday they intend to fight any further redundancies and are seeking urgent talks with the government to either mount a rescue package or to nationalise the company. It is unlikely the government will consider either option, given its own budgetary constraints. The company implemented a IPounds 51m redundancy package in 1987, shedding 1,200 jobs and a further 250 jobs have gone through a voluntary redundancy scheme in the past 18 months. The slump in demand caused by the Gulf war and the ongoing recession in the US and UK, has forced the company onto short-time working for the past 18 months, but this has been insufficient to bring it back into profitability and an announcement of further rationalisation measures was considered imminent. A company spokesman said yesterday however 'we are not considering compulsory redundancies at this stage'. The Waterford crystal arm made a IPounds 1.2m pre-tax loss in 1991 on turnover of IPounds 73m. An extraordinary item of IPounds 5.3m, for 'initiatives taking place in late 1991 and 1992 to reduce manufacturing costs', plus interest costs and tax charges, resulted in an overall group loss of IPounds 5.2m for the year. The extraordinary item relates primarily to voluntary redundancy payments, but if the additional 550 jobs are to go in the course of 1992, it is thought likely that further provisions will be necessary.</p>

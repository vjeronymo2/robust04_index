			<p><P> April 7, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> STADIUM TO BE RAZED;  </P> <P> THE LAST FAITHFUL FANS TAKE A SEAT AT KEZAR  </P> <P> The bleachers at Kezar Stadium were chopped up and sold for $20 a plank when  1,500 football fans showed up to say farewell to the decrepit stucco pile built  in 1925.  </P> <P> The stadium, abandoned by the San Francisco 49ers in 1971 when they moved to  Candlestick Park, will be torn down as part of a $9-million project that will  result in a new, smaller stadium at the same site that will be used for high  school sports.  </P> <P> The party on Thursday night was held inside a huge tent in the middle of the  football field. Fans paid $30 each to attend the bash, where they met such  football legends as Y. A. Tittle, R. C. Owens and Leo Nomellini.  </P> <P> The party's auction saw a football signed by the 1989 Super Bowl Champion 49ers  go for $700. A 1948 St. Mary's-USF program went for $30. A jersey worn and  signed by Owens was bought for $70. A helmet signed by all the former players  who attended the party was sold for $250.  </P> <P> Tittle, who was the 49ers quarterback, said he missed the place and the crowds  that were almost close enough to touch.  </P> <P> "I remember coming through the tunnel before they put the cage over it," he  said. "It was fearsome."  </P> <P> Deborah Learner of the San Francisco Recreation and Parks Commission said  construction on the new stadium will begin in October and will result in a  structure that resembles the old Kezar.  </P> <P> The new stadium will seat 10,000. The old Kezar initially seated 10,000 in a  bowl below ground level, and a 40,000-seat above-ground superstructure was  added in 1928.  </P></p>

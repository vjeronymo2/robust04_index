			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / International Company News: NBHP takes 14% stake in Dominion North Broken Hill Peko, the Australian mining and equipment group which has been debt-free since selling its paper manufacturing and merchanting operations last year, yesterday announced that it had acquired a 14.9 per cent interest in Dominion Mining, a smaller Western Australian goldminer. The stake was purchased in two parts. A 4.95 per cent holding was built up through market purchases 'over recent weeks'. A larger, 9.9 per cent interest was then bought from Gold Mines of Australia, a small mining company which earlier this year launched a bid for Dominion. North said that it had acquired the latter stake at GMA's entry cost of ADollars 19.4m (Dollars 14.2m), or about 45 cents per Dominion share. GMA decided not to press ahead with its ADollars 182m bid for Dominion last July, after the target company granted NBHP an option to take an 80 per cent interest in Dominion's ADollars 500m Yakabindie nickel project in Western Australia - a deal which saw Dominion's share price rise significantly. GMA's bid had been seen as an opportunistic move, which aimed to capitalise on Dominion's recent management upheavals and disappointing operational and stock market performance. Since then, NBHP and Dominion have also announced that they intend to team up for an interest in the Vasilkovskoye gold project in Kazakhstan. If a joint venture agreement is reached with the Kazakhstan authorities, Dominion would retain a minority position, and North would manage the interests of both companies. However, NBHP yesterday played down suggestions that a full bid for Dominion was imminent. It said that the purchase 'reflects the commonality of interests' between the two companies and was also designed to remove instability from Dominion's share register. Dominion shares closed 2 cents higher at 42 cents on the Australian stock exchanges yesterday.</p>

[Jing] Starting 1 January this year, full-scale reform was  introduced in the industrial and commercial tax system of our  country. Could you please give us an idea how the new tax  system has been working?    [Jin] Under the correct leadership of the CPC Central  Committee and the State Council, the operation of the new  taxation system has been basically smooth and normal. This  mainly finds expression in the following phenomena: First,  commodity prices, which people are most concerned about, did not  fluctuate wildly because of tax system reform. Second, tax  revenue has maintained a steady growth. Third, the printing,  distribution, issuing, and use of invoices used exclusively for  value-added tax [VAT] did not have much problem. Fourth, on the  whole, the new tax system did not impact production and  circulation negatively. Fifth, in the implementation of the new  tax system, the party and government departments at all levels,  the broad spectrum of enterprises, and the general public have  been supportive and the comments it has received from various  quarters are generally positive.    Naturally, we have come across some problems during the  implementation of the new tax system. Some problems in such  major reform are inevitable, and we will encounter new problems  in the future. Among these problems, some are related to  policies, and others to operation. We have taken steps to solve  some of them in good time, while vigorous efforts are being made  to solve some others and the rest are yet to be solved after  further investigation and study. In a word, we should work hard  to implement the new tax system, constantly sum up our  experience, keep improving it, and give full play to the role of  taxation in pooling revenue and strengthening macroregulation  and control so as to promote the sustained, healthy, and rapid  development of the national economy.    [Jing] Introducing the value-added tax on a full scale is an  important aspect of this tax reform. But many people are still  not very familiar with VAT. Could you please tell us something  about VAT?    [Jin] VAT is a type of circulating tax levied on commodity  production and circulation, and labor service. "Value added" is  the incremented value created by the taxpayer through his  productive or business operation or the added value of  commodities. It can also be defined as the amount of the  taxpayer's revenue through the sale of commodities or provision  of labor service within a given period of time in excess of the  amount paid in purchasing commodities or labor service.    The VAT regime changed the practice of the traditional  circulating tax regime whereby taxes were levied on all sales  income at each transaction link, so that duplicate taxation  could be avoided. Also, it is characterized by an extensive  scope of taxation; timeliness, balance, and stability in tax  collection; and fairness of distribution. It is not only  conducive to the pooling of revenue, but also helps encourage  enterprises to follow the principle of economic efficiency and  choose the optimum organizational form for production and  business operation. It also facilitates total tax reimbursement  for export commodities in keeping with international practice,  so as to make our products more competitive on the international  market. That is why we say this is a scientific and rational  tax category.    [Jing] Could you please explain the scope of collection and  the range of taxpayers in connection with VAT? What are the tax  rates?    [Jin] VAT is applicable to all produced, wholesaled,  retailed, and imported commodities, as well as labor service in  processing, repair, and servicing. All industrial and  commercial enterprises, as well as other units and individuals,  that sell taxable commodities or provide taxable labor service  are payers of VAT.    The VAT rates come in three grades:    1. The basic VAT rate is 17 percent, applicable to the  great majority of general commodities and taxable labor service.    2. The low VAT rate is 13 percent, applicable to daily  necessities and agricultural means of production, such as  grains, edible vegetable oils, tap water, gas, central heating,  books, newspapers, chemical fertilizers, and farm pesticides.    3. A zero rate is applicable to export commodities,  which means VAT paid will be fully reimbursed after the  commodities have exited.    [Jing] Could you tell us what is meant by taxes not  included in the calculated prices? Some enterprises have put a  17 percent VAT on the original prices of their commodities. Is  this the right practice?    [Jin] An important aspect of the reform introducing VAT is  that the previous practice of including tax in the calculated  prices has been switched to that of not including tax in the  calculated prices. In the process of commodity sale in all the  stages before the retail stage, the receipt should specify the  price without VAT and the amount of VAT charged.    According to a survey, when the old practice of including  tax  in calculated prices was in effect, the proportion of tax in  each 100- yuan price averaged 14.5 percent. After the practice  of not including tax in the calculated prices was introduced,  the tax portion should be deducted from the taxable value, and  therefore the price would be 85.5 yuan, representing a smaller  tax base. But according to the guideline for the reform which  requires maintaining the original tax burden on the whole, the  state must collect 14.5 yuan in tax on the basis of the  commodity price of 85.5 yuan. Therefore, the original 14.5  percent tax rate should be converted to a rate not included in  the calculated prices, i.e., 14.5 divided by 85.5 equals 17  percent. This way, when a commodity is sold, the specialized  VAT invoice should contain two separate entries, namely, the net  price of 85.5 yuan and the tax of 85.5 x 17 percent = 14.5 yuan.  The total price payable by the buyer remains 100 yuan (85.5  yuan + 14.5 yuan = 100 yuan). Therefore, the separate  calculation of VAT does not cause price hikes and it is wrong of  some enterprises to add a 17 percent VAT to the original  commodity price, which should be redressed immediately. The  State General Administration of Taxation [SGAT] has demanded  that taxation authorities at all levels cooperate with local  price control departments in checking and penalizing this  practice. We also hope that all enterprises will  conscientiously abide by the state tax law and that all circles  in society will support our work.    [Jing] How is payable VAT calculated? Is the 17 percent VAT  levied on every link of commodity production and circulation?  Will it cause an overall increase in commodity prices?    [Jin] Let me explain and analyze this topic in detail.    First, let us find out how the payable amount of VAT is  calculated. Just now we said that VAT is levied on the added  value arising from the sale of commodities and provision of  labor service. But, in economic activity, the added value is  hard to calculate precisely so as to provide a basis for tax  calculation. Therefore, the method of indirect calculation is  commonly used for this purpose, i.e., the sales volume of a  commodity is first used as a basis for tax calculation, on which  the applicable tax rate is used and the VAT is levied on the  buyer. This amount of tax is called sales tax. The balance of  the commodity seller's sales tax minus the VAT he already paid  when procuring the commodity (known as the procurement tax) is  the actual VAT payable by this commodity seller.    Next, I will take garment production and the subsequent  business transactions as an example of how the payable amount of  VAT is calculated.    Given that a textile mill sells 2 million yuan's worth of  cotton fabric to a garment factory and the sales tax is 2  million yuan x 17 percent = 340,000 yuan, and that the  deductible procurement tax already paid is 100,000 yuan, the VAT  payable by this textile mill will be: 340,000 yuan - 100,000  yuan = 240,000 yuan.    The garment factory sells to a wholesale enterprise the  garments manufactured from the cotton fabric purchased from the  textile mill at a price of 4 million yuan. The sales tax is: 4  million yuan x 17 percent = 680,000 yuan. The deductible  procurement tax paid is 340,000 yuan. The VAT payable by the  garment factory will be: 680,000 yuan - 340,000 yuan = 340,000  yuan.    The wholesale enterprise distributes the garments purchased  from the garment factory to a retail shop at the price of 5  million yuan. Its sales tax is: 5 million yuan x 17 percent =  850,000 yuan. The deductible procurement tax paid is 680,000  yuan. The VAT payable by the wholesale enterprise will be  850,000 yuan - 680,000 yuan = 170,000 yuan.    The retail shop sells the garments purchased from the  wholesale enterprise to consumers at the price of 6 million  yuan. Its sales tax is: 6 million yuan x 17 percent = 1.02  million yuan. The deductible procurement tax paid is 850,000  yuan. The VAT payable by this retail shop will be 1.02 million  yuan - 850,000 yuan = 170,000 yuan. According to the existing  price regime in our country, retail prices contain taxes and are  the sum of net prices plus sales taxes. In other words, the  price at which the retail shop sells the garments to the  consumers is: 6 million yuan + 1.02 million yuan = 7.02 million  yuan.    Though sales tax is calculated according to the sales price  and the 17-percent tax rate for each taxpayer, because deduction  of the VAT paid at the previous transaction point is allowed at  each transaction point, the taxpayer only has to pay the balance  of the sales tax minus the procurement tax paid, and the tax  bearing ratio is less than 17 percent. The final tax burden is  entirely borne by the consumer, the tax bearing ratio being 17  percent. That is why the actual VAT will not cause duplicate  taxation, nor will it increase the burden on the taxpayer, still  less cause overall price hikes.    [Jing] What are the VAT-related regulations on small  taxpayers?    [Jin] Considering the specific circumstances of some small  enterprises and private business operators, in order to  strengthen the management over tax collection and ensure fiscal  revenue, we have adopted a simple method of taxation for small  taxpayers whose annual sales income is below the standard level  and whose accounting calculation mechanism is not adequately  developed. By this method, we collect VAT according to their  sales income and a 6 percent tax rate.    Small taxpayers mainly refers to taxpayers who produce  taxable commodities or provide taxable labor service and whose  annual sales volume is under 1 million yuan and taxpayers who  are engaged in the wholesale or retail of taxable commodities  and whose annual sales volume is under 1.8 million yuan.    If a small taxpayer has an adequately developed accounting  calculation system and is able to accurately calculate payable  taxes according to the accounting regulations and the  requirements of the tax authorities, it may, at the discretion  of competent local tax authorities, pay taxes in the capacity of  ordinary taxpayers.    Some time ago, some small taxpayers complained that, because  they could not use specialized VAT invoices like ordinary  taxpayers, their production and business operations were  negatively impacted. In this regard, we have taken some steps  and alleviated this problem. For instance, the tax authorities  in various localities stepped up the classification of taxpayers  and upgraded to the level of ordinary taxpayers some small  taxpayers who basically met the requirements of ordinary  taxpayers. The SGAT specially issued a circular stating that,  at the discretion of the authorities, the taxation office may  issue specialized invoices for the goods sold or taxable labor  service provided by small taxpayers who have been conscientious  in performing their obligations as taxpayers.    Here, I would like to stress that we hope all enterprises  will develop their accounting system, strengthen financial  management, and pay taxes according to law. This is very  necessary for ensuring the revenue of the country, improving the  management of enterprise operation, and raising economic  efficiency.    [Jing] You just mentioned specialized VAT invoices. What  are the state regulations in this regard?    [Jin] Specialized VAT invoices are not only an important  type of commercial instrument used in the taxpayers' economic  activities, but are also legal proofs recording the tax  obligations of the selling party and the procurement tax of the  purchasing party. They play an extremely important role in the  calculation and management of VAT. For this reason, the SGAT  specially formulated and promulgated "Regulations on the Use of  Specialized VAT Invoices."    Taxation organs at all levels must attach great importance  to  the use and management of VAT invoices and should take the  initiative in obtaining the support of the party and government  leaderships at all levels, as well as the support and  cooperation from all relevant departments, such as financial  departments, banks, auditing departments, industrial and  commercial administration, public security, courts, and  procuratorates, in strictly controlling the printing and use of  special invoices. Those who use them in violation of  regulations must be immediately stopped and given an appropriate  penalty. Those who dare to defy the law and forge special  invoices to evade state taxes and undermine the economic order  must be sternly punished according to law.    In the meantime, we hope all VAT payers will use the  specialized invoices in strict accordance with the stipulations  of the tax authorities. This is not only to protect the state  tax revenue and economic order, but also to safeguard the  legitimate rights and interests of taxpayers.    [Jing] Director Jin, as far as we know, there are still some  people who are not very clear about the consumption tax. They  think that it is a new levy on all consumer goods that will  cause overall price hikes. Could you please explain the  consumption tax a bit?    [Jin] Yes. Consumption tax is a tax levied on specific  consumer goods. This is a new tax introduced following reform  in the industrial and commercial taxation system. But in  essence, consumption tax is derived from the product tax and VAT  in the original tax system. It is a product of the replacement  of the old system with the new, not an extra tax levied on  consumers.    The prices of commodities under the consumption tax used to  contain product tax and VAT (e.g., the product tax rate for  Grade A cigarettes being 52 percent). Now, after the  introduction of the uniform 17 percent VAT rate, the tax burden  on such commodities has been reduced. Compensating such  reduction by way of collecting consumption tax is to ensure  fiscal revenue on the one hand and, on the other, adjust the  consumption structure and guiding consumption orientation. This  does not increase the overall burden of taxable commodities. In  other words, the consumer goods subject to consumption tax are,  on the whole, maintaining their previous levels of tax burden.  Besides, a consumption tax is not levied on all consumer goods;  it is applicable only to a small number of consumer goods  designated by the state. Therefore, introducing a consumption  tax will not, and should not, cause price increases.    Toward the end of last year, rumor had it that the state  would start levying consumption tax on home appliances and  therefore the prices of commodities in this category would be  significantly increased, thus starting a small wave of panic  purchasing. This was a sheer misunderstanding. In fact,  commodities under the consumption tax do not include home  appliances.</p>

			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Letter: Liffe will retain edge over DTB Sir, I must disagree with the assertion by Deutsche Terminborse (DTB) that its clearing facilities will give it a competitive edge over Liffe ('Competition between Liffe and DTB intensifies', November 5). This certainly does not show in existing business where, as your article states, Liffe has a 67 to 70 per cent share of the bond futures market and the DTB only 30 to 33 per cent. The London Clearing House (LCH) clears Liffe and the other London futures exchanges. LCH's real-time clearing system and cross-market risk management and banking systems allow it routinely to handle volumes many times larger than the DTB's - over 1m contracts were cleared in one day in September. The breadth of Liffe's European bond contracts, and the margin offsets LCH provides between them, will be a major advantage for the new 'Bobl' contract Liffe is introducing. David Hardy, managing director, London Clearing House, 1-2 Crutched Friars, London EC3N 2AN</p>

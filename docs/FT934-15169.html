			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Unravelling the puzzle of real bond yields BRITISH investors may remember the record 5 per cent real yield which was briefly featured by index-linked gilts just before the UK's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism last year. That yield has now collapsed to 3.1 per cent, a change which has been fundamental to the strength of all the financial asset markets over the past 13 months. Such a yield adjustment has been reflected in big price rises on index-linked gilts. The longest-dated example, redeemable in 2030, has risen by 33 per cent since shortly before Black Wednesday. More importantly, the fall in real yields has created headroom for the equity market, allowing the dividend yield on UK equities to drop below 4 per cent and still allow a premium for risk. The UK is rare in having a financial instrument which encapsulates the concept of the real yield. The fall in real returns is, however, not a domestic but a global phenomenon. According to Barclays de Zoete Wedd the real return on 10-year government bonds across the Group of Ten countries averaged some 5 per cent during the 1980s but has now declined to about 3 per cent, or possibly 2.8 per cent on the basis of a consensus expectation of inflation next year. The process has gone furthest in the US, where the real yield on this basis appears to be only about 2.2 per cent. In countries such as France and Spain the figure is about twice as high, a differential which ought to be unsustainable in free-flowing international capital markets. However, in the absence of index-linked securities the concept of a real return is not wholly robust, and depends upon bondholders' expectations of inflation which may be too pessimistic. And clearly there is something unusual about the US bond market at present, shored up as it is by the banks, which are operating on the basis of a profitable spread over America's rock bottom short-term interest rates and are scarcely concerned at all with real yields, as a long-term investor should be. Japan is a particularly interesting case. With 10-year bond yields down to 3.8 per cent, and inflation liable to disappear completely, it is closer than any other country to a 1930s-type scenario. In the first half of the 1930s the real yield on UK gilts averaged about 7 per cent a year, a perverse figure for a slump, and one that arose because prices were actually falling. Internationally, real returns were very high during the 1980s. Investors were determined not to be caught again by the inflation of the 1970s, although in the event inflation declined until about 1987. Real rates then dipped, but rose again at the beginning of the 1990s, when the US continued to borrow on a massive scale and Germany unexpectedly joined it in heavy deficit after reunification. There was talk of a global famine of capital as real bond yields peaked in the summer of 1992. Given the international recession, however, it has not worked out like that. The Bundesbank has bludgeoned the German reunification boom into submission. The Federal Reserve has pumped liquidity into the US economy but has generated only a stuttering recovery. There turns out to have been plenty of capital, enough not only to finance the deficits but to generate a roaring global bull market in bonds. Nominal 10-year interest rates have dropped by nearly 2 percentage points for the Group of Ten countries since mid-1992, and since inflation has changed little (and is not expected to fall much below 3 per cent next year either) the effect can nearly all be attributed to the fall in real returns. How much further can this trend go? Real yields are low, but not exceptionally so. Over the past 30 years real bond returns in the US, Japan and Germany appear to have averaged about 2.5 per cent; exclude the 1970s, when the real yield was negative in the US and Japan (but not in Germany) and 3 per cent would be more typical. With global GDP growth running at only about 1 per cent against potential trend output growth of perhaps 2 1/2 per cent there is still considerable slack. Although we may be nearing the trough for real returns, we probably have not got there yet. But if recovery were to become more general next year there could be a rapid increase in capital market pressures.</p>

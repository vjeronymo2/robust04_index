			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Egyptian President Muhammad Husni Mubarak at the </F> Non-Aligned Movement Conference in Cairo; date not given]    [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate:  Ministers, delegation heads, guests, and brothers and sisters  here in Cairo, which is proud of having witnessed the first  phase of the Nonaligned Movement's establishment and having  experienced the movement's glory, the Egyptian nation receives  you with welcome and appreciation. The nation voices its  confidence in the ability of this pioneering movement to  revitalize its resources and mobilize its potential to confront  the growing challenges and changing circumstances to serve  humane causes and perpetuate the noble values and principles  that the movement has advocated worldwide.    The emergence of the movement in the early 1960's was an  inspired response to the world situation to ward off dangers  that faced humanity for the first time. It also emerged to  fulfill the aspirations of many nations for an international  community dominated by peace, safety, and justice and free from  fear and oppression. Thus the movement was able to express the  ideals and principles that our struggling nations have believed  in and to which they have clung in their policies and actions  and to embody the great hopes and concepts that have inspired  millions of people everywhere to achieve a better future for  mankind.    The great consciousness of our nations and their awareness  of  their mission in a world full of danger and challenges combined  with the piercing and sound vision of the first generation of  the founding leaders. The movement was established on firm  bases and managed to achieve colossal accomplishments that  cannot be erased or eroded by the passage of time. The movement  undoubtedly contributed to forming the new world order,  therefore it remains qualified to participate in formulating a  collective concept for the future.    The modern world will testify to the movement's success  during its more than 30 years of positive work. It has  succeeded in transforming newly independent developing nations  into a unique entity with influence in world politics, not only  because of its numerical or material power but because of its  constant support for justice and equality.    The modern world will testify that the movement struggled,  along with other countries that shared its belief in peace and  principles, to defend each nation's rights to eliminate  colonialism and foreign hegemony and destroy all forms of  discrimination and oppression everywhere to guarantee the  creation of an international community on sound bases that are  able to face danger and challenges.    Hence, the movement opened new horizons for nations to  cooperate in a brotherly way and to learn how to coexist without  hegemony and exploitation in a mutual sense of the unity of  interest and fate so that every state can mobilize its resources  and energy for development and progress. Thus, peace and  construction triumphs over war and destruction, logic overwhelms  conflict and dispute, right dominates over force, the value of  justice precedes the de facto method, and resources can be used  to set up farms and factories instead of stockpiling weapons and  tools of destruction.    These have been historic accomplishments. It would be wrong  for anyone to think they were achieved easily and that the road  toward them was strewn with roses and full of good intentions.  Rather, they were achieved with strenuous work, bitter  sacrifices, insistence on reaching the goals, and with the  ability to maintain a clear vision amidst various storms. Trust  and historic responsibility require us all to realize that this  great heritage alone is no longer enough to deal with our age's  requirements.    The tenets, theories, regimes, and relations of the world  around us have changed as our communities themselves have  changed from within. In the past, our causes revolved around  liberating the homelands, but today they focus on liberating man  in all fields and spheres. In the past, our hopes were for  independence, but today the hopes are for security and  prosperity. In the past, we were less in number and strength  but today we are greater in population, although we are burdened  with problems and crises.    Our only option is to use our strength to confront the new  reality with an effective and competent body that is adequate to  achieve the new objectives in this changeable world.    The common ground joining us has not disappeared but its  form  and substance have changed. Consequently, we urgently need to  make a continuous and comprehensive revision of the movement's  progress. We must not revise its principles, concepts, and  foundations but must reconsider our methods of action, ways of  thinking, and the way we deal with a new and different world  order.    What we have called for has become an inevitable reality so  that we could maintain the movement's credibility, emphasize its  legitimate presence, and guarantee its effectiveness in and  influence on the world around us. Frankly speaking, unless we  accept this essential point and move with an open and  enlightened mind and strength to adapt to new circumstances, we  will be lending credibility to those who claim that the movement  has become form without substance.    Stagnation represents the road toward extinction. But  progress and development are the laws of life, or rather the  definite way toward survival and development. Therefore, we  must free our supreme ideals from mere empty slogans or  expressions that are impotent in reflecting reality and facts.    Perhaps the changes in the world are moving faster than the  Nonaligned Movement itself. It is possible that some of its  foundations have become a part of past history. But this does  not mean that the movement has lost its role or could perhaps  lose its way and distort its vision. It means that the movement  must now deal with the new facts with objectivity, a positive  approach, and a method based on reality and facts.    The world situation that has prevailed over the past era was  the division of countries into Western and Eastern blocs. But  the new situation is represented by two poles, the north and  south. But this situation must exist in an atmosphere in which  cooperation, not estrangement; and unity, not fighting; should  prevail. It is important that the Nonaligned Movement's spirit  should continue to bear the fruit of its efforts. After all the  successive experiences we have passed through, we stress that  every member state and people are freely entitled to pursue the  way of life they desire and the mode of development that fits  their circumstances.    Concerning the foreign policy sphere, the essence of the  nonaligned method is for every member country to pursue a  foreign policy harmonious with its independence, its free will,  and its right to make its own decisions in the framework of an  international order based on the principles of justice and  legality, the rule of law, and commitment to international  charters, notably the UN Charter.    The essence of nonalignment is, by its very nature, an  enlightened philosophy based on a give-and-take attitude and on  continuous interaction that enriches international thinking and  seeks the advancement of individual nations at every historical  stage in line with these nations' particular circumstances.    Brothers and sisters, perhaps you will agree with me that  the  Nonaligned Movement's response to the new international  challenges must be in the following two indispensable ways.  First, the movement must be the representative of the interests  of the entire developing world. It must draw up the broad  outlines of the developing world's progress in coordination with  the group we call the Group of 77. We must always remember that  the Nonaligned Movement never sought to promote just the  interests of its own members but earnestly sought to promote the  interests of all nations, regardless of those nations' diverse  policies, experiences, and stages of development. Since its  establishment, the Nonaligned Movement has understood the  concept of a united human destiny. It has committed itself to  seeking united human goals by various methods and through  numerous organizations.    The movement's diversity is a source of enrichment and  strength, not weakness. This enrichment must be increased  through free, creative relations.    The second thing the Nonaligned Movement needs is to enhance  its ability to begin a real dialogue with all international  parties. It must be able to address the world in a language the  world can understand. This dialogue must cover all economic,  political, and cultural international issues. If the dialogue  is limited to a few countries, even if they are large and  populous, it will be futile. All the world's countries must be  effective partners in the dialogue and must influence its  course. This is because we are seeking to reach the haven of  safety together, leaving no country to fall into an abyss of  backwardness and poverty.    Needless to say, the new pattern of world economic ties  based on groupings, free trade, and the market economy dictates  that everyone handle this new situation with new methods and  concepts. The basis of this concept is openness not seclusion,  mutual dependence not self-reliance, which is no longer useful  in a world that only has room for people who are economically  sound, politically strong, socially secure, and regionally and  domestically stable.    This new situation I am talking about has created methods  and  bases for economic dealings among all the world's  countries--north and south--as happened recently in the context  of a system determined by the new GATT [General Agreement on  Trade and Tariffs] and the new organization for world trade [not  further specified]. As developing nations, we have to deal with  this situation by achieving a balance in interests between the  developed and developing nations and maintaining the political  and social stability necessary for economic development.    Ladies and gentlemen, let us agree at this meeting on a new,  clear method for the movement to guide our actions and  intentions and to consolidate the benefits we have gained  through our long strife, so that we will not waste our past but  will take advantage of our present and look forward to our  future. We must carefully and soundly scrutinize world changes  to discover what is viable and what is temporary. This is the  way to deal with these developments, so that we can help our  movement to adjust and adapt, because adjustment and adaptation  are two elements necessary to create a driving force that will  have an effect on the shape of the future.    We do not want the movement to turn into a grouping reliant  on negativity fearful of the emergence of a new world order.  Our true need is for participation through a joint concept and  joint action to contribute to devising the features of this  order. We should take the best of the past system, add to it  our current experience, and enhance it with strong guarantees  for the sake of the future.    I believe that such an initiative by the movement to  participate in charting the new world order is the surest  guarantee of establishing this order on bases of equality,  justice, respect for each nations' rights, honoring state  sovereignty and independence, nonintervention in their internal  affairs, and commitment to the responsibilities and duties  stipulated in international charters and documents.    The Nonaligned Movement, with the solidarity and unity of  its  members, is qualified to assume this historic responsibility and  to positively contribute to setting up a new network of  international relations through which a just, comprehensive, and  durable peace can be achieved; a network dominated by security  and stability, one free of violence and terrorism. Thus, an  order will be established in which stockpiling of  mass-destruction weapons will cease and peoples'  rights--foremost of which are their right to a free, dignified  life with development and prosperity--will be asserted. It will  be an order that will end regional wars and conflicts by  peaceful means--by negotiations, dialogue, and reconciliation;  an order in which an end will be put to ethnic, sectarian, and  religious conflicts, in which education will spread and health  services in all nations will improve and illiteracy, poverty,  and disease will disappear.    This is the road that must be followed so that humanity can  reach new horizons in progress and liberty without  discrimination on ethnic, religious, class, or color bases.    Therefore, the renewal of the international structure which  we have known for the past half century is one of the foremost  tasks in which the Nonaligned Movement must creatively  participate. We must propose a clear-cut, practical, and  specific concept for a new structural organization of the United  Nations, both in terms of its role and responsibility for  preserving world peace and security and its economic and social  tasks. This must be done in a way that will reflect the new  realities and will guarantee the necessary degree of democracy  in international relations by expanding the participation in its  bodies and organizations.    We must debate things and revise matters and, indeed, must  formulate a new, fair method that will turn the United Nations  into a truly international organization that will at the same  time be as effective as desired.    We must put forward a new concept of international security  based on equality, mutual trust, coexistence, and the  renunciation of force in international dealings. We must  realize that we are living in an era where economic competition  has first priority in international relations. Consequently the  traditional concept of security becomes insufficient unless it  is closely associated with economic security and comprehensive  development. This can never happen unless human development is  given the priority it deserves in our plans and national  programs and in our economic and social policies, both on the  national and international levels.    We must also propose a scientifically objective view of the  way to resolve armed conflicts and regional disputes peacefully.  Doubtless this particular issue has high priority within the  Nonaligned Movement, indeed among all countries. Although the  world has made great strides in eliminating barriers between  countries and surmounting the hurdles of ideology and  self-isolation, it still suffers from ethnic strife and border  and tribal conflicts.    It is both honest and courageous to say that the conflicts  among nonaligned countries have been more ferocious and  devastating than among other countries. This can cause  tremendous damage to the movement.    It is true that these disputes are not exactly new to the  Movement but what is new is the fierce fighting and appalling  destabilization of societies, unprecedented terrorizing of  citizens, and destruction and annihilation of lives and property  in the same country. We have seen pictures of such conflicts in  some European areas which we thought had achieved security,  stability, and coexistence among their peoples. Perhaps the sad  tragedies in Bosnia are the best indication to the  disintegration and setback of a founding (?member) of the  Movement.    What we see in other nonaligned countries in Africa, such as  Somalia, Rwanda, and Burundi, is not less painful despite the  OAU's strenuous efforts to stem the bloodshed and preserve lives  and property. What is noteworthy in this regard is that the OAU  agreed at the Cairo summit of last June to set up a mechanism to  settle and prevent disputes and handle crises on the continent.  Although it is in the first phase of its evolution, this  experiment is worthy of support by the entire Nonaligned  Movement provided there is the political will necessary to  utilize and implement it.    If the picture is painful in numerous parts of Africa, there  is a glimmer of hope for the whole world with the triumph of the  South African people's will and their application on the 10th of  this month to join the international community as a democratic,  non- racial state.    This important experiment, which was based on dialogue and  negotiations among all factions, has been successful in  eliminating the effects of discrimination between various sects.  Hence it deserves a double congratulation--congratulations from  our movement, which supported that experiment, and  congratulations from the entire world to its people and its  combative president Nelson Mandela.    Wisdom, logic, and reason triumphed and everyone achieved a  sound democratic victory, which became an example for the whole  world to follow. Another window of hope was opened with an  important step taken by the African countries toward economic  integration when they ratified the agreement to establish the  African Economic League. No doubt this accomplishment will  achieve important economic results. It will have far-reaching  consequences for the economic activity on our African continent  and on the developing countries in general. It will also have a  positive impact on the north-south and south-south dialogue.    As for Asia, which includes our brothers and partners in the  Movement, it has not been safe from hotbeds of tension and  conflicts in areas that ought to be quiet and in which the  language of dialogue and reconciliation should supplant the  methods of confrontation and pressure.    While saluting the fruitful efforts that settled Cambodia's  crushing crisis, we look forward with hope and optimism to the  attainment of stability, peace, and amity between the people of  the two Koreas in east Asia and among nations in other hotbeds  of tension in that continent.    Similarly it is time for the Afghan people to unite and halt  the sequence of mutual destruction and killing. Everyone in  that country must rise to the required level of responsibility  in a manner befitting the abundant support it was accorded  during its liberation struggle. Its citizens must now devote  themselves to rebuilding their homeland and must renounce  violence and destruction. They must turn their country into an  oasis of stability and security for themselves, their neighbors,  and for the friends who supported them during the liberation  war, instead of repaying some of them with insults and threats.    Ladies and gentlemen, it is time for the regions of conflict  to turn into zones of security and cooperation. The areas of  tension and instability must turn into domains of peace and  reassurance and borders must turn into crossing points for trade  and goods, not remain passages for refugees and displaced  people. Seas and oceans around the continents must become  bridges of communication among countries. Their resources must  become a joint inheritance of humanity to be used to meet the  increasing needs of this planet's current and future citizens.    You know that in the Middle East, after more than 40 years  of  bloody strife, we recently experienced one of the most splendid  days of modern history when the Palestinian and Israeli leaders  signed the Palestinian Autonomy Agreement. This was a first  step toward a just solution of the Palestinian issue enabling  the Palestinian people to regain their rights, resume their  process of reconstruction, and again take up their mission of  extending bridges of creative cooperation for the good of future  generations.    Brothers and sisters, parts of the Middle East and the Arab  world continue to suffer the effects of wars in which many  victims have fallen and nations have been terrorized. The  calamities and painful repercussions of those wars could have  been avoided. It is pointless now to blame this or that party.  It is much more profitable to pledge earnestly to renounce the  use or even the threat of force in our relations. We must seek  to be wise and sober in handling our relations by respecting  each other's sovereignty, independence, and territorial  integrity. We must avert the dangers that threaten the security  and domestic stability of each of our regional countries.    The logic of the new world order which we are seeking to  shape is the logic of reason, wisdom, dialogue, and persuasion,  not the logic of force and armed power. It behooves us to  adhere to this logic with the same firmness which we call on  others to have.    Ladies and gentlemen, the long night of suffering and  hardship is not yet over and we are still waiting for the dawn  of a new world. Nevertheless, humanity will soon see the threads  of light. We must seize these threads and weave them into a  comprehensive human view based on the advocacy of peace and  stability. We must do this for the sake of progress,  prosperity, justice, liberty, and human beings everywhere.    Let the bells chime the birth of this new dawn. Let the  light of the civilization of the 21st century shine on a wiser  and strong- willed Nonaligned Movement that will be able to  provide a better future for its member nations and humanity at  large.    Make God grant you success and guide your steps. Peace and  the blessings and mercy of God be with you. [applause]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Defense Minister Muhsin Dallul says the problem with  Israel is political, not security, and that no security  committee will be worthwhile if the political issue--namely  occupation--is not resolved. He pledged that the Army will  assume responsibility for security in the south after the  occupation has been ended, and that there will be no weapons in  the south other than those of the Army.    The minister, who was talking to the dean of editors Milhim  Karam, said any linkage between the Syrian presence in Lebanon  and the Israeli occupation of Lebanese territory is treason. He  explained that the Syrian presence is requested by the  government for pressing needs related to the reunification of  Lebanon. He said the Army's main mission is to take charge of  security in the south and ensure that no armed force other than  the legitimate forces will be present there.    The defense minister categorically denied the possibility of  incorporating agent Lahd militias [South Lebanese Army] into the  Lebanese Army. This matter exclusively concerns Lebanese  authority, he said. Dallul said the Army must always reflect  the country's pride and might. He said the Army is obtaining  weapons to defend the country and serve the citizens and their  security. He pointed out that Army roadblocks are established  only for security reasons, not political ones.    On the security situation in the country, Minister Dallul  stressed that no one can prevent the judiciary from opening any  file. He expected the security agencies to complete the  investigations on the bombing of the Phalangist Party  headquarters very soon. He praised improvements in the security  services and the military establishment.    Dallul described the upcoming Syrian-U.S. summit as historic  and decisive for the region's crisis, especially Israel's  occupation of Syrian and Lebanese territory. He expected the  summit to result in major progress in the negotiations and  relations with the West, notably the United States.</p>

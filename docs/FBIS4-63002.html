			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Khokhlov report: "Mission Repays a Debt"] </F>   [Text] Colonel General Yevgeniy Podkolzin, commander of  Airborne Troops, held a news conference yesterday on the  problems of Russian peacemaking [mirotvorchestvo] in the "hot  spots" of the world and the CIS. He reported that during their  two-year stay in the former Yugoslavia the Russian "blue berets"  have conscientiously "worked off" almost the whole of Russia's  debt to the United Nations: Just $200 million is outstanding  from the previous $1.5 billion.    But Russia's power structures have still not drawn up a  system of social protection for the peacemakers. In the opinion  of the UN administration, they are the best of all the soldiers  in Vukovar and Sarajevo today, but for some reason it is only  the motherland that forgets that its sons are not out for a  stroll but are at war....    The Airborne Troops' commander has no information about  sending new Russian military contingents to other countries,  particularly Rwanda. The question of sending peacemakers to  Nagorno-Karabakh also remains problematic: First the troops of  the sides engaged in the conflict must be separated.</p>

We should  perfect commodity markets, vigorously develop key elements  markets, pay attention to building both hardware and software  items, and positively develop the professional intermediate  organizations that facilitate the cultivation of markets.

We should have  commodities on every market, increase the turnover of goods,  increase transaction volume, and engage in large-scale  transaction in flexible manner, extend business to northern  China and even the whole country in order to attract traders  from all over the country.    Third, we should successfully manage markets.

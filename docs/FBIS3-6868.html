The prime minister, however, suggested that an appropriate  approach should be adopted to facilitate the inspection. The  approach must be one where they (North Koreans) must not feel  they are being ordered to do this and that, he [words  indistinct] comment on the current stand-off between North and  South Korea on the nuclear issue.    South Korea Monday said it would resume preparations for war  games with the United States in the face of a renewed threat  from the North's to withdraw from a global pact limiting the  spread of nuclear arms.    Speaking to reporters at the 10th International General  Meeting of the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council here, Dr.  Mahathir said he did not think North Korea wanted to have a  nuclear war.    I don't think they want to have a war at all, he said.</p>

			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Observer: Opinionated Poles Who is the most popular world statesman in Poland today? Why, none other than Bill Clinton, according to a poll conducted by CBOS, a leading Polish pollster. Rather odd really, when you consider Clinton is less than whole-heartedly supportive of some Polish aspirations. The US president has declined to hold a press conference in Warsaw today, thus saving himself the bother of publicly repeating his 'yes - but not just yet' response to Poland's plea to be allowed to join Nato. The poll gives Clinton a 75 per cent approval rating - one point more than Margaret Thatcher but significantly less than the 87 per cent George Bush got in a similar poll in 1991. Still, Clinton can bask in the glory of being more than twice as adored as his host, president Lech Walesa; he gets a measly 35 per cent. Even Nelson Mandela manages only 39 per cent; Boris Yeltsin gets 31 per cent. And OK, polls lie - but they have their uses. This one at least can be waved by John Major's supporters when they get tired of hearing scurrilous suggestions of his greyness. Major may not be popular in Poland - only 34 per cent of Poles like him - but at least he's (relatively) big - only 42 per cent of Poles can't identify him. That's success: 62 per cent of the respondents are baffled when asked if they know who Silvio Berlusconi is. A bit like Italy perhaps: 100 per cent of Italians know Berlusconi is their prime minister - but how many know who he is?</p>

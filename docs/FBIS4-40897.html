			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Shanayev] </F>   [Text] Vladikavkaz June 17 TASS -- At a meeting held here  today between North Ossetian President Akhsarbek Galazov and  Russian First Deputy Interior Minister Colonel-General Yevgeniy  Abramov, they discussed the implementation of the Russian  presidential decree on "the introduction of an emergency  situation in a part of the territory of the North Ossetian and  Ingush republics" issued on May 30, 1994.    This document empowers the Russian Interior Ministry, the  Federal Counter-espionage Service and the provisional  administration forces from the russian defence ministry, to take  measures to prevent armed clashes between hostile sides, to  ensure the safety of civilians and the strict observance of the  emergency rules and regulations.    According to Yevgeniy Abramov, the Russian presidential  decree on the return of refugees and Russian Federation  Government decisions to implementing the decree must be carried  out. However, refugees should not be simply returned to their  villages, but their security and normal living conditions should  also be ensured. The minister expressed concern over the large  quantity of arms possessed by the population, and over the  activities of unlawful armed formations, which are trying to  destabilize the situation and undermine the implementation of  the Russian presidential decree.</p>

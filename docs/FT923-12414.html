			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Building society lifts home loan rate CHELTENHAM &amp; Gloucester, the UK's sixth largest building society, yesterday raised its mortgage interest rate from 10.75 to 10.99 per cent, bringing other lenders under pressure to follow suit. The society blamed the government for the increase, saying it was being forced to put up rates for both savers and borrowers because of the introduction last week of a high-interest savings account by National Savings. Mr Andrew Longhurst, C&amp;G chief executive, said yesterday that unless other societies raised their rates to savers, they would see money flowing out to National Savings. Mr John Wriglesworth, housing finance analyst at the City stockbrokers UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said he believed most other building societies would have little option but to follow C&amp;G by raising their rates. A Treasury spokesman defended the National Savings strategy, saying other lenders had not followed C&amp;G's lead. He said the savings rate was not the highest in the market. C&amp;G's increase means that its 330,000 borrowers will be charged about Pounds 8.50 a month more on a Pounds 50,000 repayment mortgage. Halifax, the largest UK mortgage lender, said it was not surprised by the C&amp;G move but that it had no immediate plans to increase its mortgage interest rates. Other large mortgage lenders were taken aback by C&amp;G's increase. But they also said they had no plans to increase their rates at present. However, all building societies complain that their savings business is under serious pressure from National Saving's First Option Bond, which offers basic-rate taxpayers 7.75 per cent interest after tax (10.34 per cent gross) for one year deposits. C&amp;G has already launched a savings account which is intended to compete with the higher rates being offered by National Savings. The C&amp;G London fixed-rate account will pay 7.8 per cent net (10.4 per cent gross) until October 1 1993.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Karmalito] </F>   [Text] Simferopol May 26 TASS -- Crimean economy is in "the  gravest condition". This diagnosis was included in the report  of Crimean Vice-Premier Yevgeniy Saburov, who addressed the  first session of the Supreme Soviet (parliament) of the  peninsular republic, which resumed its work on Thursday.    According to Saburov, one of the major contributing factors  to the economic situation consists in Ukraine's opposition  towards initiatives aimed at economic stabilization, which  resulted in virtual disruption of the forthcoming summer  vacation season. (Crimea used to be one of the most popular  places to spend one's summer vacation in the former Soviet  Union; it is famous for its numerous resorts, beaches,  entertainments, etc.)    When explaining measures suggested by the Crimean Government  and aimed to lead the republic out of the crisis, Saburov  pointed out the task of attracting external investments.    In his opinion, developing the transportation sphere should  be the first priority - that is, developing a network of  airports and sea ports, establishing a trade route along the  Strait of Kerch.    The second guideline is the recreation field based on  Crimea's huge resort/sanatorium potential and oriented to the  average consumer.    Investments in development of the oil and gas-extracting  industry are also important, but, however, potential damage to  Crimean nature has to be taken into account.    To conclude, the vice-premier pointed out reinforcing the  leading industries and agriculture.    He described privatization as one of the major means of  raising production effectiveness. He also envisioned a  substantial liberalization in the economic field, an open-door  policy in respect of investors and lifting many other  restrictions.    In Saburov's opinion, it will take about two years for  Crimea  to overcome the crisis, provided that "the government acts  correctly".    When debating on the report, lawmakers made some pungent  criticisms in regard of the report and the proposed programme  for stabilizing the economy.    Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov emphasized that it is  absolutely inadmissible to accuse the government, which has not  actually set about working, which does not exist in point of  fact.    Meshkov called upon the lawmakers to realize the full  measure  of their responsibility before the people of Crimea, to  appreciate the confidence they are enjoying and take care of the  interests of the Crimeans, rather than their own ambitions and  self-esteem.</p>

We have determined that the Mexican fruit fly has been eradicated from California, and that restrictions on the interstate movement of regulated articles from California are no longer necessary to prevent the spread of the Mexican fruit fly into noninfested areas of the United States. This action relieves unnecessary restrictions on the interstate movement of regulated articles from the previously regulated area. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Interim rule effective October 7, 1994.

Stefan, Operations Officer, Domestic and Emergency Operations, Plant Protection and Quarantine, APHIS, USDA, room 640, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782, (301) 436&hyph;8247.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Mexican fruit fly,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Anastrepha ludens  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (Loew), is a destructive pest of citrus and other types of fruit. The short life cycle of the Mexican fruit fly allows rapid development of serious outbreaks that can cause severe economic losses in commercial citrus-producing areas. The Mexican fruit fly regulations, contained in 7 CFR 301.64 through 301.64&hyph;10 (referred to below as the regulations), quarantine infested States, designate regulated areas, and restrict the interstate movement of regulated articles from regulated areas in order to prevent the spread of the Mexican fruit fly to noninfested areas of the United States. Quarantined States are listed in &sect;301.64(a), and regulated areas are listed in &sect;301.64&hyph;3(c).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In an interim rule effective November 30, 1993, and published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on December 6, 1993 (58 FR 64102&hyph;64103, Docket No. 93&hyph;157&hyph;1), we quarantined the State of California and designated a portion of Los Angeles County as a regulated area because that area had been found to be infested with the Mexican fruit fly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on insect trapping surveys by inspectors of California State and county agencies and by inspectors of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, we have determined that the Mexican fruit fly has been eradicated from Los Angeles County, CA. The last finding of Mexican fruit fly thought to be associated with the infestation in this area was made on November 17, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since then no evidence of Mexican fruit fly infestations has been found in this area. We have determined that the Mexican fruit fly no longer exists in Los Angeles County, and we are therefore removing it from the list of areas in &sect;301.64&hyph;3(c) regulated because of the Mexican fruit fly. As a result of this action there is no longer an area in California regulated because of the Mexican fruit fly. Because we have determined that the Mexican fruit fly no longer exists in California, we are removing California from the list in &sect;301.64(a) of States quarantined because of the Mexican fruit fly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Immediate Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that there is good cause for publishing this interim rule without prior opportunity for public comment. Immediate action is warranted to remove unnecessary restrictions on the public. The area in California affected by this document was regulated due to the possibility that the Mexican fruit fly could be spread to noninfested areas of the United States. Since this situation no longer exists, the continued regulated status of this area would impose unnecessary restrictions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because prior notice and other public procedures with respect to this action are impracticable and contrary to the public interest under these conditions, we find good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553 to make it effective upon signature. We will consider comments that are received within 60 days of publication of this rule in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . After the comment period closes, we will publish another document in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . It will include a discussion of any comments we receive and any amendments we are making to the rule as a result of the comments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. For this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived its review process required by Executive Order 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule removes restrictions on the interstate movement of regulated articles from a portion of Los Angeles County, CA. Within this regulated area, there are 1,125 small entities that may be affected by this rule. These include 350 distributors/wholesalers, 750 fruit and produce stands, 12 nurseries, 5 growers on a total of 2 acres, 3 swap meets, 2 processors, 2 community gardens, and 1 packer. These 1,125 entities comprise less than 1 percent of the total number of similar enterprises operating in the State of California.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These small entities sell regulated articles primarily for local intrastate, not interstate, movement, and the distribution of these articles was not affected by the regulatory provisions we are removing. Many of these entities also handle other items in addition to the previously regulated articles. The effect on those few entities that move regulated articles interstate was minimized by the availability of various treatments, that, in most cases, allowed these small entities to move regulated articles interstate with very little additional cost. Therefore, the effect, if any, of this rule on these entities appears to be minimal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12372  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials.

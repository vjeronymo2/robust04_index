			<p>BFN     [Text] Turanj, Croatia, April 8 (AFP) -- A ceasefire  agreement between Croatia and breakaway Krajina to end more than  two years of conflict is being broadly respected, a UN  Protection Force (UNPROFOR) commander said here Friday.    Commander Bertrand de Lapresle said the first meeting of a  joint Croatian-Serb commission to assess the Krajina ceasefire  went off Friday without a hitch and was a "big success."    The meeting was held in a "positive and constructive  climate," commented the French UNPROFOR commander, who said he  was "very happy" about the "goodwill" shown since a ceasefire  was signed March 30.    De Lapresle said the ceasefire terms had been respected but  did not specify how far the two forces had withdrawn from the  front line. He said they had gone "a long way in the right  direction."    According to the accord which took effect Monday, each group  was to pull back 1,000 metres (yards) from the front line by  Friday 0700 GMT, leaving a buffer zone to be patrolled by  UNPROFOR. The withdrawal of heavy weapons was also due to be  completed by Friday.    Fighting has been going on for more than two years between  Croatian authorities and the self-declared Krajina Serb  republic, which occupies a quarter of Croatian territory and  which wants union with Serbia.    In Turanj itself, which passed into Serb control in 1992,  most houses have been completely destroyed by the fighting.    De Lapresle said a further meeting would be held "very soon"  to resolve problems in the four zones placed under UNPROFOR  control, which needed "high-level decisions."    Earlier on Friday, Croatia's semi-official agency HINA  reported that General Janko Bobetko had complained about Serb  forces holding some positions in contravention of the peace  agreement.    In a meeting with De Lapresle, Bobetko said the Serbs were  holding a position near the airport at Zadar on the Adriatic  coast, where its guns also threatened the Zemunik airport  recently reopened by Croatian forces, HINA said.    He also complained that Serb forces were blocking access to  Jasenovac, a historical site where 600,000 Jews and Serbs were  massacred during World War Two by Croatia's Nazi-backed Ustashis.    A delegation of Croatian Jews who wanted to visit the former  concentration camp to commemorate the Holocaust were not able to  reach Jasenovac Friday, according to the agency. It said the  UNPROFOR commander promised to take up Croatian concerns with  Serb officials.</p>

			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: ABB The doubling of the Asea and Brown Boveri share prices over the past 18 months has been driven partly by ABB's growth prospects in East Asia. So its comments yesterday about mounting competition and falling prices, particularly in China, were unsettling. While too much should not be read into one half's figures, it was perhaps significant that margins in power generation, which is heavily biased towards East Asia, slipped back in the first six months although the group figure rose from 7.2 per cent to 8.5 per cent. This improvement is the reward for years of painful cost cutting which has seen production shifted to low cost centres in eastern Europe and Asia. The process continued in the first half, with the group wage bill down 3 per cent compared with a year before. The group's margin target of 10 per cent looks within reach over the next couple of years and the combination of recovery in Europe, continued growth in East Asia and a falling tax charge could lead to a near doubling of earnings by 1996. That would put the shares of Brown Boveri, the Swiss parent company, on a multiple of around 12. Shares in Sweden's Asea, which owns the other half of ABB, have proved less popular with international investors recently and their multiple of 1996 earnings is down to little more than 10. The ratings are in line with other European capital goods companies with arguably poorer growth prospects. The worry is that the pressure on prices in East Asia will absorb all ABB's efforts on cost. If so, its fatter rivals are in for a very painful ride.</p>

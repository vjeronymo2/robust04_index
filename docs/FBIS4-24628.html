			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Current Affairs" program] </F>   [Text] A CRI [China Radio International] reporter (Li Ben)  visited the (?Xiyuan) Prison in Shanghai last week and talked  with some prisoners there about their lives behind bars. Dong  Jun has the second part of our series on prisons in China:    [Recording begins with a Chinese song fading into Dong Jun's  voice in English] This song was written by inmates in the  (?Xiyuan) Prison; the lyrics express not only regret for the  past, but also determination to become a better person.    Singer Li Haibo has been here for five years. He was found  guilty of forgery and embezzlement in 1989. Now he is a member  of the New Life Song and Dance Troupe in the prison. Fifty  other inmates are also members of the group. Li Haibo said the  correction officials believe music cures the wounds in the  prisoners' hearts.    [Li is briefly heard speaking in Mandarin fading into  English  translation] It may sound impossible that one can learn music  in jail, but we are doing it. Music has been a good influence  on me. I believe if I always try my best and perform well, the  government will reduce my sentence.    [Dong] There are altogether more than 3,000 inmates in this  prison. Besides the song and dance troupe, many prisoners have  joined art classes to learn sculpture, painting, and handicraft  making. Others study computer science, accounting, and English.  The prison administrator said they had been organizing these  activities for 11 years in the hope that prisoners can benefit  from them in the future. However, the main activity for the  inmates is labor. It is believed that through labor, the  prisoners will form good work habits and the sense of discipline  and cooperation.    In the (?Xiyuan) Prison, inmates make clothing.  Twenty-year-old Wang Jiang is serving a four-year sentence for  burglary. Our reporter talked with him, while he was making  prison uniforms in the factory.    [Reporter] Is this hard work?    [Wang is briefly heard speaking in Mandarin fading into  English translation] It's OK, not very harsh.    [Reporter] How many hours do you work everyday?    [Wang] Eight hours a day.    [Reporter] What do you think about working in prison?    [Wang] It's very good for me. I was spoiled by my parents  and hated work. But now I know what life means; it will do me  good when I go back to society.    [Dong] Mai Lianhua is the warden of the prison. He said the  meals of the inmates are scientifically arranged. [Mai is  briefly heard speaking in Mandarin fading into English  translation] We pay a lot of attention to the nutrition of the  food. We are supplying vegetable, meat, and other staple food  according to the needs of the body.    [Dong] Mai Lianhua said there are five dishes provided for  each meal. Everyday, the menu is put up for the prisoners to  see. Most of them have regular meals; male inmates over 60 and  female over 55 can enjoy special meals. Muslims have their own  cafeteria. Everyone will receive a special meal on his or her  birthday. However, the rooms for the inmates here are rather  crowded. Built in 1901 by British colonizers, the prison is  (?already) small, and Shanghai is well-known for its housing  problems. In this city of 12 million, even law-abiding citizens  don't have a big enough place to live.    Twenty-two-year-old Xie Ying has been an inmate here for  three years. [Xie is heard briefly speaking in Mandarin fading  into English translation] The food here is alright. The room is  very small; there are two people who share one room. It's OK.  We can take a shower everyday in the summer.    [Dong] There's a warden hotline in the prison. Inmates may  call the warden when they have problems. They can also write to  government offices if they think they are being treated  unfairly. A psychological counseling office has also been set  up for the inmates. It opens twice a week. The prisoners'  conversations with doctors are kept confidential.    Eleven foreign convicts are also inmates here. They are from  Britain, the U.S., Germany, Pakistan, and Myanmar [Burma]. Most  of them are convicted of drug-related offenses. They study  Chinese laws and language while in jail. Some of them teach the  Chinese inmates English. Their living allowances are 20 percent  higher than a Chinese prisoner and all of them have their own  cells.    (Lachlan Campbell) is from the United Kingdom. He was  sentenced to 15 years for marijuana trafficking two years ago.  He has learned how to make artistic masks while in prison.  When asked if he's being treated fair, (Campbell) had this to  say:    [(Campbell)] For sure, for sure. One hundred percent sure.  The treatment here is very fair. With the warden, with the  education [words indistinct] They always try to help us. At  the beginning we weren't sure, but when warden comes out with  Mr. Dong and Mr. (Jin), they always offer assistance. Now that  we understand it, we have been here two years, now we understand  it.    [Dong] (Lachlan Campbell) also had this to say to his  family:    [(Campbell)] I want to say to my family that I hope to see  you in the not so distant future. Thank you. That would be  very nice and tell them that I'm in good health and I play  regular football. We have lots of football competitions and I  enjoy playing football very much.    [Dong] For all the prisoners, going home is their biggest  wish. The prison is a place for them, not only to repent and  correct their mistakes, but also to prepare for the new life in  the future. For China Radio International, I am Dong Jun. [end  recording]</p>

Mohammad-Khan said: The main indexes obtained during the  first development plan indicate that the country's economy is  moving toward an organized and programmed economy -- and taking  into account the world economic recession, Iran enjoys a  relatively good growth.    Referring to the substitution of imports that will reduce  future foreign currency requirements, he said: With the  increase in domestic production, there will be a fall in the  import of petrochemical goods and foods, as well as commodities  needed by consumer and intermediate industries while the export  of nonoil goods will increase.    Mohammad-Khan also spoke on the policy of privatization and  said the government intends to sell factories through auction or  limited partnership with individuals interested in investment  and management.    The minister for economic affairs and finance also spoke on  Iran's important role of creating positive prospects for  neighboring countries' economies, as well as creating provisions  for transport of goods from Iranian ports.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with tax police Colonel Vladimir Avdiyskiy, Chief </F> of the Control-Audit Administration of the Department of the Tax  Police of the Russian Federation, by Sergey Ivanov; place and  date not given: "Do Not Forget To Declare Your Incomes. Citizens  of Russia Will Begin To Be Checked for Honesty"]    [Text] Another item has been added to the spring  concerns of our compatriots--by 1 April 1994, according to the  law, it is necessary to submit a declaration of income to the  local tax inspectorate. Many people are still regarding this  measure as extraordinary. Therefore, NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA asked  Tax Police Colonel Vladimir Avdiyskiy, chief of the  Control-Audit Administration of the Department of the Tax Police  of the Russian Federation, to provide several  clarifications.    [Avdiyskiy] There is nothing extraordinary here. Moreover,  declaring income began back in 1993. New mechanisms for  implementing Russian tax legislation are being put to work in a  planned way. What is now new to Russians has long been  commonplace in countries with a developed market economy. For  instance, for citizens of the United States, declaring incomes  is nothing more than an episode in their intense, event-filled  life.    [Ivanov] But Russia is not America. We have many people who  consider it their duty to evade the law, to find loopholes in it.    [Avdiyskiy] So making citizens of Russia declare their  incomes will contribute to closing up these loopholes. This is  being done in keeping with the law of the Russian Federation "On  Individual Income Tax" of 7 December 1991. The essence of the  problem is this. In the system of market relations the  possibilities for Russian citizens to acquire income have  increased sharply. Today it is not prohibited to combine jobs,  engage in free entrepreneurship, or obtain dividends by  investing money in one enterprise or another. Therefore, it was  decided to switch to a practice of taxing the aggregate annual  income. The point of the declaration is extremely simple: each  year the taxpayer must report his income to the state and,  taking the amount into account, make the corresponding payments  into the budget.    [Ivanov] Does this pertain to all or only to certain  categories of citizens?    [Avdiyskiy] The declaration is mandatory for those whose  aggregate taxable income during 1993 exceeded 3 million rubles  [R]. True, there are exceptions here. For example, citizens  whose incomes involve only their main job are released from  filing tax declarations even if their aggregate annual income  has exceeded R3 million. But citizens registered as  entrepreneurs must submit a declaration regardless of the amount  of income they received. All the fine points and details that  interest the taxpayers can be explained at the local state tax  inspectorates.    As for the tax police, as a law enforcement organ, it mainly  works with those who conceal from taxation incomes in large and  especially large amounts.    [Ivanov] Incidentally, what is the difference between  "large"  and "especially large"?    [Avdiyskiy] According to criminal legislation in effect  (Article 162-2 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation),  concealing especially large amounts is when there is concealment  of income or other objects of taxation on which the tax exceeds  1,000 (one thousand) times the minimum wage. And large amounts  of concealment are when this indicator exceeds 50 (fifty) times  the minimum wage.    It is no longer billions but even trillions of rubles that  bypass the state treasury. In 1993, for example, according to  the budget, the income should have been R23 trillion-R25  trillion, but it actually amounted to R17 trillion. You can  consider that whatever was due to the state settled out into  private pockets. And a very great deal depends on this--whether  or not wages will be paid promptly to workers of the state  budget-financed sphere, stipends to disabled persons, pensions  for elderly people, stipends for students, whether or not the  government will be able to mobilize financial resources for  fighting inflation, crisis phenomena in the economy, and so  forth. Looking at the large picture, we are speaking about the  very fate of the reforms that have been started and economic and  social stability in society.    And therefore, ensuring unwavering observance of tax  legislation is among the priority tasks.    Declaring income will be, if you will, a kind of test of  honesty of many thousands of Russians and will give tax organs  additional opportunities to figure out who is who. For today, in  addition to honest entrepreneurs, there are many who steal  billions, build villas or even entire palaces for themselves,  buy up real estate, and submit to the tax inspector an official  notice that they received wages corresponding to the wages of a  teacher or a nurse. Such individuals will undoubtedly have to  deal with the tax police, and they will have to give  explanations of the origin of their income and make  reimbursement to the state for damages caused, counting fines,  and possibly they will also be held responsible in keeping with  Article 162 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.    [Ivanov] And how much can they be fined for such  machinations?    [Avdiyskiy] Concealment of large amounts is punishable by a  fine in an amount of up to 350 times the minimum wage. And  concealment of especially large amounts is punishable by  incarceration for a period of up to five years with or without  confiscation of property or a fine in the amount of from 300 to  500 times the minimum wage.    [Ivanov] Harsh. But what if, say, I have not filled out the  tax declaration by 1 April?    [Avdiyskiy] That option, as they say, will cost more. If you  fail to submit a declaration or submit it late, you can be fined  10 percent of the amount due for payment. Moreover, for each day  of delay in paying the income tax there was a penalty of 0.3  percent last year, and this year it will be 0.7 percent. Plus  there is the administrative fine.    In general here one should mention Article 163 of the  Criminal Code of the Russian Federation. It says: "Failure to  appear at the organs of the State Tax Service to submit  explanations or refusal to submit explanations concerning  sources of income (profit) and their actual amount, and also  failure to submit documents and other information concerning the  activity of the economic entity at the request of the State Tax  Service shall be punished by a fine in an amount of from 100 to  150 times the minimum wage, set by legislation."    [Ivanov] Declaration of income, like any report, presupposes  documentary confirmation of expenditures and incomes. What does  the taxpayer need for this?    [Avdiyskiy] This is an extremely significant point. A waiter  in the United States, for example, must even indicate the total  tips he has received. Receipts, credit slips that have gone  through the bank, personal checks, and other documents are saved  like treasures there. An American will never throw away a check  on which the amount paid for an apartment, summer house, or  motor vehicle is registered, documents confirming the right to  inherit property, the receipt of credit, etc. The Russian  taxpayer has to get used to this too. It is necessary not only  to document your income but also the sums of taxes paid  throughout the year. For this, whether you like it or not, you  have to be your own bookkeeper--keep track of your receipts and  large expenditures, since "forgetfulness" is no excuse when  determining liability for concealing income.    [Ivanov] Why is the deadline set at 1 April and not, say, 1  March?    [Avdiyskiy] The law gives the taxpayer three months to  gather  the necessary documents and determine how much income has been  received during the year. Although there is no single criterion  here. Different deadlines have been set in other countries. The  American taxpayer, for example, must submit a tax declaration by  15 April of the following year. In Sweden the deadline for  submitting it is 15 February.    [Ivanov] And will the tax organs be able to handle the  avalanche of declarations? Even without this, one has to stand  in line for hours waiting for a tax inspector.    [Avdiyskiy] There is a problem here, and an extremely  serious  one. The State Tax Service and we, the Tax Police, are  experiencing a critical need for a modern computer base, a  unified information system that will encompass the whole country.    [Ivanov] Do you not see a danger that a good cause could be  discredited by the willfulness of unscrupulous tax bureaucrats?    [Avdiyskiy] If such cases occur, the taxpayer will always  have the right to appeal incorrect actions on the part of the  tax organ worker.</p>

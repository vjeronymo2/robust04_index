			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Survey of Ireland (5): Reaching for the sky - Aviation maintains world-class aspirations SIX MONTHS ago, Ireland's National Aerospace task force set itself the goal of creating in Ireland a new European hub for jet aircraft maintenance by the end of the decade. It envisages a world-class centre for aerospace maintenance, overhaul and repair, together with associated manufacturing and service industries which by the year 2000 is intended to provide employment for 11,500 people. Established two years before, the task force was set up under the aegis of the Industrial Development Authority (IDA) to bring senior management teams from Ireland's nascent aerospace sector together with industry and trade specialists from the government, to draw up a coherent strategy. They concluded that a number of key trends in the world aerospace industry have created an opportunity for Ireland to become an important European player in niche sectors of the market. These trends include a shift by big manufacturers towards sub-contracting; the growing use of composite materials in aircraft construction; high labour costs and turnover in certain industrialised countries, and Europe's growing strength in world aerospace activity. As a result the IDA now views aerospace as one of one of its top priorities in industrial promotion, alongside pharmaceuticals, electronics and tele-marketing. Up to now it has invested in excess of IPounds 25m in what are considered to be three anchor projects for the sector. The first, Team Aer Lingus, is the aircraft maintenance subsidiary of the Aer Lingus airline, Ireland's national carrier. Growing out of the airline's own maintenance facilities, the company has invested an additional IPounds 35m to increase its hangar capacity by 50 per cent to 19 bays, to be able to offer to outside operators full airframe maintenance on Boeing's entire range of passenger aircraft as well as McDonnell Douglas DC9s. A Team subsidiary, Airmotive Ireland, provides jet engine overhaul for Pratt and Whitney and Snecma engines. Shannon Aerospace rolled back its hangar doors for business last September. This IPounds 80m joint venture between Swissair, Lufthansa and the Shannon-based GPA aircraft leasing group provides heavy maintenance ('D' checks) and important line checks ('C' checks) for airframes, and other services, such as repairs and painting, for narrow bodied aircraft such as the Boeing 737 and MD80s. Shannon Turbine Technologies (STT) is a IPounds 24m joint venture of GPA and Sulzer Brothers of Switzerland. It is building a high technology facility for the repair and remanufacture of high pressure turbine parts for Snecma and General Electric jet engines, which are widely used in Europe. The plant is scheduled to open in autumn 1993. Such projects are intended to provide the nuclei of two aerospace-orientated industrial 'clusters', one at Dublin, centred round Team Aer Lingus, the other at Shannon in the west of Ireland, centred round Shannon Aerospace and STT. In five years, when Shannon Aerospace plans to be working at full capacity with a workforce of over 1,000, it expects to be the largest independent supplier of heavy maintenance for Boeing 737 and MD80 aircraft in Europe. The company estimates that there are now 300 operated by airlines in the European region that rely on outside maintenance facilities and plans to win a substantial share of that business. At full capacity, the facility can carry out 50 full 'D' checks, or more than 300 'C' checks, each year. There are clearly expectations that the general economic recession, which has dampened demand for aircraft travel over the past two years, will eventually bottom out. In the meantime, their executives are hoping that even with an acknowledged overcapacity in maintenance facilities in Europe at present, they can compete effectively on price, quality and turnaround time. In opening the Shannon Aerospace facility in September, Mr Otto Loeffe, the president of Swissair, said: 'The ultimate survivors (in the airline industry) will be those who are able to operate with low costs and still provide a quality service. Maintenance is a vital component in that equation.' Through the IDA and the Shannon Development Corporation, the government offers substantial capital, training and R&amp;D grants. A flat-rate corporation tax of only 10 per cent until the year 2010 is a strong incentive, while a pool of well-trained labour with firm roots in the country is a big attraction to foreign companies suffering from high wage costs and high staff turnover. A new aircraft engineering faculty at Limerick university will produce its first graduates next year, adding to the flow of skilled technicians and scientists into the industry. Mr Loeffe said: 'One of the reasons for our location here has been the high level of Irish government support for the project'. It is that government commitment to the aerospace sector which has largely dispelled worries about the present recession killing off the infant industry in its cradle. The Irish government has already invested tens of millions of punts in development and training grants and is set to spend tens of millions more. Although neither the government nor Shannon Aerospace is willing to reveal the extent of public finance that has gone into the latter's facility, it is thought to be in the region of IPounds 20-30m, a substantial proportion of that having been spent on workforce training, the total bill for which will reach IPounds 25m at full capacity. At the bottom line, the government views the aerospace sector as an important potential provider of sustainable high-tech jobs.</p>

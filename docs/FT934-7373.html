			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Early gains trimmed before the close THE STOCK market's base rate optimism survived the absence of a move by the Bundesbank yesterday, but the extra bonus which came from the success of the Nafta vote in the US congress soon melted away. An early gain of more than 18 points on the FT-SE 100 Index was lost when Wall Street opened lower, but the UK market turned higher again at the very end of the session. Further consideration of the sharp fall in domestic inflation confirmed the market's view that a base rate cut at Budget time is now virtually certain, with analysts disagreeing only over whether Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, will risk a cut of more than one point. Few London strategists had been predicting a rate cut from the Bundesbank yesterday so there was little significant response when the German central bank left rates unchanged. The FT-SE Index closed 5.5 higher on the day at 3,125.5, having rallied after a burst of activity in the futures sector had pushed the Footsie briefly into negative territory. Second line stocks extended this week's recovery, taking the FT-SE Mid 250 Index ahead by 15.8 to 3,452.5. Trading in second line issues made up around 58 per cent of the day's Seaq total which rose by 6.6 per cent as base rate hopes rekindled confidence. Company results continued to provide an erratic guide for the stock market which will next week face trading statements from important members of the consumer industries which the market hopes will lead the UK out of recession. There was some recovery in BOC, which has been weak since announcing results. Both Whitbread, the brewer, and Storehouse the retail group that includes the Mothercare chain, pleased the stock market with good profit figures and positive comments on the trading outlook. But Amstrad, the consumer electronics group, depressed the sector with a profits warning. It was the turn of the store sector to catch up with the revival of interest rates optimism. Banking stocks, which had made their response in the previous session, made little further progress yesterday. International stocks were mostly firmer, on relief that worries over the NAFTA vote had proved unfounded, although the response in London was tempered by Wall Street's downturn at the close of the previous session. Concerns over the downgrading of the Hong Kong stock market by a leading US investment bank also proved overdone. Figures from Cable &amp; Wireless were taken calmly and HSBC held steady. A steady trend in fixed interest and sterling currency markets underpinned the equity market's confidence that domestic interest rates can be cut at the end of the month. But market strategists pointed out that a full point cut may be already in the market and that the Budget is almost certain to bring less encouraging news for the stock market in the form of higher VAT taxes. Some concern was expressed at the apparent petering out of retail sales in October when they rose by only 0.1 per cent. Nikko Europe commented that this looked like a 'disappointing result for the beginning of the Christmas shopping season. Consumers are willing to buy but not on credit and only at the right price ..'</p>

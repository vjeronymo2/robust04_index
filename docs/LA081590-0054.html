			<p><P> August 15, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> OFFICIALS ARGUE OVER TRAFFIC JAM'S CAUSE;  </P> <P> TRANSPORTATION: CALTRANS AND THE CITY BLAME EACH OTHER FOR A DEBACLE THAT  OCCURRED SATURDAY WHEN THEY DID ROADWORK AT THE SAME TIME AND IN THE SAME AREA.  </P> <P> City and state traffic officials acted decidedly non-collegial Tuesday as they  traded barbs over the cause of a giant traffic jam that tied up the Ventura  Freeway as well as surface streets in Sherman Oaks and Encino for several hours  Saturday.  </P> <P> Officials agreed that the tie-up was caused by motorists detoured off the  Ventura Freeway by lane and ramp closures that are part of a widening project.  But city officials said they were not adequately notified of the closures,  which were scheduled for the same time as repair work at Sepulveda and Ventura  boulevards that added to motorists' woes.  </P> <P> "We weren't adequately notified" by Caltrans of the freeway closures, said Guy  Quinn, assistant general manager of the Los Angeles city Department of  Transportation. "They told us about the closures but not the extent of it."  </P> <P> Caltrans also failed to notify the city that motorists would be directed to use  Ventura Boulevard as an alternative route, Quinn said.  </P> <P> "The city was adequately notified," said Pat Reid, a Caltrans spokeswoman. She  said a Caltrans engineer gave the city a detailed explanation of the agency's  road closure and detour plans. "This was a routine contact with DOT. It was  done just like it's been done before, for weeks," Reid said. "We have no  further comment."  </P> <P> The traffic jam clogged streets for miles at midday. Traffic snarled major  east-west streets between Reseda and Van Nuys boulevards and north-south  streets between Victory and Ventura boulevards, Quinn said.  </P> <P> Diverting traffic off the Ventura Freeway were lane and ramp closures that are  part of a $76-million project to widen the roadway between Agoura Hills and  Studio City.  </P> <P> The worst congestion occurred at Ventura and Sepulveda boulevards, where a  private contractor was digging a trench for the city's Automated Traffic  Surveillance and Control system. The contractor, Steiny &amp; Co., was allowed  to close one lane of the boulevard in each direction, Quinn said. Ventura  Boulevard has six through-traffic lanes and two left-turn lanes at that  intersection.  </P> <P> Quinn said the contractor closed only the number of lanes allowed. "There's no  way that little work caused that tie-up," Quinn said. "It wasn't us."  </P> <P> City traffic crews, which use the computerized control system in City Hall to  detect traffic jams and alter signal operations in response, watched the jam-up  develop Saturday, Quinn said.  </P> <P> "They dealt with it as best they could," he said. But no amount of signal  manipulation could ease the movement of two lanes of freeway traffic being  diverted onto city streets, he said.  </P> <P> Despite Saturday's problem, Quinn vowed that a similar mix-up "won't happen  again. We're going to be a lot more cautious in the future."  </P></p>

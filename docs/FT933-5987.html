			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Troops will leave Lithuania 'today' RUSSIAN troops are to be withdrawn from the Baltic republic of Lithuania today on schedule, Mr Algirdas Brazauskas, the Lithuanian president, said yesterday in a national radio address. A spokesman for Russian Presdent Boris Yeltsin later confirmed the troops' withdrawal, but refused to say if it would be today. The normally good relations between Russia and Lithuania were soured earlier this month when Russia said it would suspend the withdrawal of 2,500 service personnel and their families because Lithuanian negotiators had insisted on raising the issue of compensation for damage done since the first Soviet occupation in 1940. No figure was mentioned, but Lithuanian newspapers reported that a sum of about Dollars 150bn was mentioned. Mr Brazauskas said the question of compensation would be 'the object of further talks' - a formula which appears to have satisfied Moscow. Russia is in neither the mood nor any condition to make reparations for a Soviet past it disavows. Evidence of this came yesterday when Mr Sergei Filatov, chief of staff to Mr Yeltsin and chairman of a commission to determine events which led up to the shooting down in 1983 of the South Korean civilian airliner KAL007 over Soviet airspace, said that the Soviet Union bore no guilt for the incident. Mr Filatov said pilot error had taken the plane 350 miles off course, deep into Soviet airspace. Mr Hong Soon-young, South Korea's deputy foreign minister, said in Seoul yesterday that his government would reschedule debts owing to South Korea on cash loans of Dollars 1bn and tied credits of Dollars 470m, on which Russia has paid only Dollars 12.7m interest from a promised Dollars 36.8m payback. A further Dollars 1.53bn of a Dollars 3bn aid package extended to the former Soviet Union in 1990 has been frozen at Russia's request, Mr Hong said. 'They have said the interest rates and other conditions on the South Korean loans were unfavourable.'</p>

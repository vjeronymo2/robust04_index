			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / International Company News: Comcast UK's IPO postponed Plans by Comcast UK Cable Partners to raise funds through a secondary share issue in the US were put on hold yesterday when underwriters postponed the sale because of poor conditions in the market for initial public offerings of stock. The decision comes at a crucial time for cable companies in the UK which have announced, or are considering, flotations in London. Comcast UK Cable Partners, a unit of the Philadelphia-based cable communications group Comcast, had initially planned to sell 11.75m shares for up to Dollars 18 each. The US IPO market, however, has been extremely weak in recent months, and the underwriters, led by investment bank Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, struggled to find buyers. Comcast is believed to have set a floor for the issue of around Dollars 14 a share, and when investors showed little interest at that level, the offering was postponed. Analysts in New York were not overly concerned by the postponement. Ms Jessica Reif, cable industry analyst at the US brokerage house Oppenheimer, said: 'The economics of the business are still sound . . . It was just that the IPO market stinks.' In London analysts acknowledged that the Comcast decision might have an impact on the timing of some flotations although they expect the debut of TeleWest, the UK's largest cable operator, to go ahead next month as planned. Most said they did not expect it to affect the valuation of TeleWest which is believed to have strong institutional support. Last month TeleWest, a joint venture between TCI of Denver, the largest cable operator, and US West, the American telephone company, confirmed its plans to come to market through a global share offering expected to value the group at around Pounds 1.7bn (Dollars 2.55bn). TeleWest plans to seek a full listing for its shares on the London Stock Exchange and a registration of American depository shares on Nasdaq. Yesterday Mr Alan Michels, TeleWest chief executive, dismissed suggestions that the postponed Comcast secondary issue would have any effect on its plans, arguing that TeleWest was 'a special case'. 'We will still get a good reception in both the UK and US markets,' he said. The company and its financial advisers will be meeting institutional investors over the next few days and are expected to price the issue shortly.</p>

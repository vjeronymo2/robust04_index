Sato, Casio Computer </F> Devices Main Operations Division, LCD Development Department]    [Text]  <H5>  Practical Application of Multi-Color Images By Utilizing </H5> Double Refraction    New reflective-type color liquid crystal panels have been  developed by utilizing the double refractivity of liquid  crystals and phase-contrast plates. (The anisotropy of the  refraction index is known as double refractivity. For example,  when the refraction index in direction of the apse line of  liquid crystal molecules is large, the refraction index  perpendicular to that axis is small. The double refraction index  is the difference between both refraction indices.) These panels  will be manufactured in the spring of 1994. A bright image can  be obtained with the reflective type even on portions without a  color filter. The panels are broadly divided into two types, the  TN (twisted nematic) liquid crystal type and the STN (super  twisted nematic) liquid crystal type. The colors in the TN  liquid crystal type are fixed, as either background or image  colors. In the STN liquid crystal type, the red, green, blue and  gray within one dot can be arbitrarily changed. At the present  time a 1/160 duty matrix image is possible.    More than 20 years have passed since liquid crystal panels,  which are thin, lightweight, and energy efficient, have been put  to practical use. Now, these panels are building a solid  position as key devices for electronic products. The field of  applications is beginning to spread in a number of directions,  and the capabilities required of liquid crystal panels is varied  as well. However, the color liquid crystal panels currently in  use, which have internal backlighting, are not always energy  efficient. Demands for reduced power consumption are increasing,  especially in the fields of OA (office automation), AV  (audio-visual), and communications; if this demand can be met,  market share would increase dramatically. The plans for the  reflective-type color liquid crystal panels that were recently  developed lead us to believe that this is the most likely  technology to meet that demand.  <H5>  Utilizing Double Refraction of Both Liquid Crystal and </H5> Phase-Contrast Plate    Double refractivity of both liquid crystal molecules and  phase-contrast plates are utilized for colorizing.  Phase-contrast plates, which until now were used with "color  off" for optical coloration, are instead used with "color on."    The coloration methods for liquid crystal panels can be  broadly divided into methods utilizing spectral properties and  methods utilizing double refractivity (Figure 1).  &lt;graphic&gt;  &lt;capt&gt; Figure 1. Liquid Crystal Panel Coloration Methods. Now,  the double refractivity of liquid crystals and phase-contrast  plates are utilized. Color filters are a general method, but  because the transmissivity of light is reduced 40 percent, it  must be a transmitting method that uses a backlight.&lt;/graphic&gt;     Methods utilizing spectral properties use color filters,  color polarizing plates, and guest-host type liquid crystals.  The general color filter method most often used at the present  time is a transmission method with an internal backlight.  However, the transmissivity of the color filter is reduced 40  percent, and the image darkens by half because the light path is  doubled by the reflection method. Ways that ensure brightness  even with the reflection method are color polarizing plates in  which the polarizing plates are colored, and guest-host liquid  crystals, but then the image colors must be fixed as a single  color when plans are drawn up.    Methods utilizing double refractivity include using the  double refractivity of only the liquid crystals, and using the  double refractivity of both liquid crystals and phase-contrast  plates at the same time. It is possible to colorize only by  using the double refractivity of the liquid  crystals,[.sup]1[/] but the image hue relies heavily on  temperature and cell thickness. (Colors can be divided into  three attributes; the color divisions red, green and blue are  known as hue. In addition, color brightness (y value)  is known as the color value, while vividness is known as chroma.  Furthermore, color is expressed in terms of hue and chroma as  two-dimensional coordinates.) If used together with the double  refraction index of phase-contrast plates, this reliance is cut  by half. From now on this combined method will be employed.  <H5>  Changing Colors With the Phase Value of Phase-Contrast Plates </H5>   The phenomenon of colorizing by using the double  refractivity  of light can be explained by polarization of light and light's  phase difference.[.sup]2[/] Light is polarized in a straight  line when it passes through a polarizing plate, and as the  double refraction index increases perpendicular to the polarized  axis due to the double refraction effect in the phase-contrast  plate, it is polarized in an ellipse. The double refraction  effect is greatest when the delayed phase axis of the  phase-contrast plate is inclined 45 toward the direction of  polarization (Figure 2). (Footnote 3. Phase-contrast plates and  liquid crystals have similar anisotropy of the refraction  indices. When the refraction index of phase contrast plates  during processing is large in the direction of elongation, the  surface refraction index perpendicular to that direction is  small. The axis in the direction where the refraction index is  large is known as the delayed phase axis.)  &lt;graphic&gt; &lt;capt&gt; Figure 2. Two Ways to Consider the Relationship Between  the Phase-Contrast Plate and the Polarizing Plate. In ordinary  TN liquid crystals, "on" approximates a parallel configuration  (a) on the polarizing plate, and "off" approximates a  perpendicular configuration.&lt;/graphic&gt;     In response to the phase differences of the phase-contrast  plate, the degree of polarization differs depending on the  wavelength of the light, and the polarized light that  constitutes the transmission axis emerges as a result. Colors  can be selected; for example, blue when the phase difference  nears 650 nm, and orange when it nears 880 nm (Figure 3).  &lt;graphic&gt;  &lt;capt&gt; Figure 3. Phase Differences and Light Intensity Depending  On Differences in Wavelength. Each color can be selected by  changing the phase difference of the phase-contrast plate. In  response to the phase differences of the phase-contrast plate,  the degree of polarization differs depending on the wavelength  of the light, and as a result, the polarized light that  constitutes the transmission axis emerges.&lt;/graphic&gt;     The light intensity I[.sub]par[/] that returns  to its origin when two polarizing plates are parallel is  proportional to the square of the value of the elliptic  polarized light amplitude projected on the transmission axis.  [`par' is parallel; `per' is perpendicular]    I[.sub]par[/] =  1/2*I[.sub]0[/]*cos[.sup]2[/](R[.sub]e[/]/_l_)  (1)    Here, I[.sub]0[/] is the intensity of the  incident light, R[.sub]e[/] is the phase  difference of the phase-contrast plate, and _l_ is the light  wavelength.    In contrast, the phase of I[.sub]per[/] in  which the two polarizing plates are perpendicular, shifts  90 relative to I[.sub]par[/].    /m/m/mI[.sub]per[/] =  1/2*I[.sub]0[/]*sin[.sup]2[/](R[.sub]e[/]/_l_)  (2)    From these equations, I[.sub]0[/][.sup]2[/]  =  I[.sub]per[/][.sup]2[/]+I[.sub]par[/][.sup]2[/]  can be derived, and because I[.sub]0[/] is  specified as the white light intensity, the colors expressed by  I[.sub]par[/] and I[.sub]per[/] are  complementary. For example, when "on" and "off" have this kind  of complementary color relationship when colorized using liquid  crystals, the color combinations are immutably determined.    Liquid crystal panels are now colorized by utilizing the  double refractivity of liquid crystals and phase-contrast plates  together. The transmission axis of two polarizing plates are set  parallel, and the delayed phase axis of the phase-contrast plate  is configured to be at a 45 angle to the transmission axis  of the polarizing plates[.sup]3[/] (Figure 4).  &lt;graphic&gt;  &lt;capt&gt; Figure 4. Configuration of the Recently Developed  Reflecting-Type TN Color Panel. Various colors can be shown by  changing factors such as liquid crystal cell thickness and  liquid crystal double refraction.&lt;/graphic&gt;     In this case, light intensity I is the value that  optically combines the effects due to the double refraction  index of both the liquid crystals and the phase-contrast plate.    I =  1/2I[.sub]0[/][1/(1+u[.sup]2[/])*sin[.sup]2[/]  ((1+u[.sup]2[/])[.sup]0.5[/]/2)/  *(cos(R[.sub]e[/]/2_l_) +  u*sin(R[.sub]e[/]/2_l_}[.sup]2[/]  +cos[.sup]2[/]((1=u[.sup]2[/])[.sup]0.5[/]/2  *sin[.sup]2[/](R[.sub]e[/]/2_l_]  (3)    Here, u = 2_D_n*d/_l_, with  _D_n representing the double refractivity of the  liquid crystal and d representing the liquid crystal  cell thickness.    The usual TN liquid crystal mode is a specific solution to  the above equation. That is, rotary polarization in which the  incident light is twisted 90 occurs under conditions in  which u = 0 when on or u =  3[.sup]0.5[/] or 15[.sup]0.5[/] when off. As a result,  contrast and brightness with a black-and-white image are best  with one phase-contrast plate. With these conditions, a mutually  complementary color relationship comes about when the voltage  given to the liquid crystal is on and off. Therefore, even when  color is added using the phase-contrast plates, the background  color and display color are determined and unchangeable.    More color schemes are possible by selecting cell thickness  and double refractivity of the liquid crystal materials and  changing u. If u is moved by using a  particular phase-contrast plate, a locus is drawn while the  chromaticity of the color displayed changes as a result of  double refraction. If we let two points on the locus be the  liquid crystal's on and off conditions, then it is possible to  arbitrarily select background and display colors.    Furthermore, there is only one phase-contrast plate now  being  used, but it is larger than two plates with different phase  values; by staggering the delayed phase axes, the number of  color schemes increases and a brighter display can be obtained.  This is because a solution is obtained that brings the polarized  light axis for each color nearer to the transmission axis as the  change in double refraction becomes larger.    This tendency increases as the phase-contrast plates  increase  in number, but because this is balanced by a reduction in  transmissivity, two or three plates are appropriate. Therefore  the value of y becomes four to six, which is  considered sufficient for practical use. Ultimately, the goal is  to realize 10 ordinary STN monochrome liquid crystals; a  breakthrough is needed.  <H5>  Controlling Voltage of Color Using STN Liquid Crystals </H5>   A wide range of colors can be displayed by substituting STN  liquid crystals, which have large double refraction effects.  Therefore, differences in color can be controlled by means of  the voltage value applied to the liquid crystals. The  arrangement of the liquid crystal molecules changes depending on  the voltage value, and the light intensity distribution for the  colors differs depending on the differences of the respective  indices of double refraction (Figures 5 and 6).  &lt;graphic&gt;  &lt;capt&gt; Figure 5. Changes in Liquid Crystal Molecular Motion and  Polarized Light Conditions Depending on Size of Voltage of  Reflecting-Type STN Color Liquid Crystal Panels. Voltage  increases towards the right. The arrangement of liquid crystal  molecules increases as the value of the voltage increases (a).  Consequently, the double refraction effect decreases, and the  intensity of light differs depending on wavelength. Light  intensity is proportional to the square of the length of the  polarized light ellipse projected on the transmission  axis.&lt;/graphic&gt;   &lt;graphic&gt;  &lt;capt&gt; Figure 6. Voltage Magnitude and Intensity for the  Reflecting-Type STN Color Liquid Crystal Panel. Light intensity  of each color differs depending on the magnitude of the voltage  applied to the liquid crystals. When voltage is lowered, the  order is blue, green and red.&lt;/graphic&gt;     In other words, changes in gradation with ordinary STN  monochrome liquid crystals are manifested as color changes.  Consequently, a multicolor display comes about because each  respective color cannot be further divided into gradations and  displayed.    Blue, green, and red can be displayed with the liquid  crystal  panels. These correspond to 0 grade, 3 grade, and 7 grade  respectively with ordinary monochrome liquid crystals (Figure 7).  &lt;graphic&gt;  &lt;capt&gt; Figure 7. Color Display Characteristics of the  Reflecting-Type STN Color Liquid Crystal Panel. By using pulse  width modulation, ordinary differences in gradation become  different colors. Blue corresponds to 0 grade, green to 3 grade,  and red to 7 grade. The value of y which indicates  brightness ranges from 2.1 to 3.5.&lt;/graphic&gt;     The magnitude of the voltage is changed by means of a  multiplexing drive using a pulse width modulation formula. The  value of y which indicates brightness ranges from 2  to 3.    In principle, the power consumed is identical to that of the  STN monochrome liquid crystal currently in use, and the cost is  also the same. In addition, an active matrix drive that combines  TFT (thin-film transistor) elements for high speed is  theoretically possible, and development is currently underway.  To complete the product line, preparations are being made for  six types of reflective-type color panels in spring 1994, up to  1/160 duty dot matrix displays (Table 1). Issues related to  higher duties exceeding 1/160 include improving the angle of  twist, and reducing _D_ _e_/_e_[.sub]per[/] and  K[.sub]33[/]/K[.sub]11[/] for the liquid crystals.    And recently, liquid crystal panels using thin, lightweight  plastic substrates are attracting attention. If the functions of  the phase-contrast plates can be maintained with these  materials, reflecting-type plastic color liquid crystal panels  could be a reality.       Table 1. Characteristics and Principle Uses of Reflective-Type Liquid Crystal Panels   Note: Those up to 1/160 Duty will be manufactured beginning in spring 1994.

On 8 March, AFP fabricated a deceptive report  saying that the invading forces of the Vietnamese communist  puppets and the two-headed government had captured certain areas  in the Pailin region. The National Army of Democratic Kampuchea  [NADK] spokesman totally rejects this false report, which is  based on the darkest and most unscrupulous political motives.    II. The Vietnamese communists and the Western alliance --  with France as the leading cat's paw -- are using the invading  forces of their Vietnamese communist puppet lackeys and the  two-headed government to attack the people and the NADK  resistance in Pailin in order to allow the Vietnamese communists  to swallow the Cambodian race completely and allow the alliance  to incorporate Cambodia into its arena. AFP -- France's  propaganda apparatus -- has stepped to the forefront by playing  an active role in fabricating deceptive propaganda in its  psychological war.    The general public is aware that ever since the creation of  the two-headed government, France has urged other countries to  assist the Vietnamese communists and their puppets and become  directly involved in establishing [as heard] the two-headed  government, so as to employ the latter in attacking the  Cambodian nation and people and the NADK resistance in the  political, military, economic, and propaganda fields. France  has carried out these actions with the dream of furthering its  neocolonialism in Cambodia.    III. The Vietnamese communists and the alliance have made  all- out efforts to prod the Vietnamese communist invaders and  the two-headed government in their military campaign against the  people and the NADK resistance in Pailin in order to cover their  most shameful and serious defeat on the Anlung Veng battlefield.  So far, though, the invading forces are not even close to  Pailin; much less having captured this or that area in the  region. This is why their French masters have strived to invent  this deceptive story -- to prevent their lackeys from being  perceived as too inferior.    IV. Based on past experience as well as recent experiences  on the Anlung Veng battlefield, the invading forces of the  Vietnamese communist puppets and the two-headed government --  mercenaries that are inflaming the war in accordance with the  strategy of the Vietnamese communists and the alliance to oppose  the king, national reconciliation, peace, and the Cambodian  nation and people -- can never prevail over the national forces,  the people, or the NADK resistance. They will certainly be  defeated, dispersed, and decimated. As for the foreign  warmongers, they will be severely condemned by the Cambodian  nation and people, no matter what.    If France continues to collude with the Vietnamese  communists  to inflame the war, which is meant to do away with the Cambodian  race, the Cambodian nation and people and the Cambodian national  resistance forces will oppose and condemn it. On the other  hand, if France joins the king and the Cambodian nation and  people and does whatever it can to achieve national  reconciliation, national unity, and peace in Cambodia in  accordance with the king's five-point policy, the Cambodian  nation and people and the Cambodian national resistance forces  will support it.    [Dated] 9 March 1994    [Signed] The NADK spokesman</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 9 June Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] Following are the main points of the Fair Trade  Commission [FTC] guidelines on business mergers:    Section 1. Mergers required to register in a simplified form  (details omitted)    Section 2. Classification standards in administrative  procedures for regular registration of mergers -- mergers  corresponding to any of the following categories will be subject  to vigorous examination. These categories are set for the  purpose of classifying and inspecting cases which may violate  the Antimonopoly Law, but cases fitting the description of the  following categories do not necessarily mean that they actually  violate the Antimonopoly Law.    (1) The market share of the merger will either be: 1) Above  25 percent; 2) more than 15 percent and will be number one in  the market; and 3) number one in the market, and will lead the  number two and three groups by more than one-fourth of the total  share of the merger.    (2) The market share of the merger will be number one, two,  or three in the market, and the total share of the top three  groups will be more than 50 percent.    (3) There will only be seven or fewer groups competing in  the market.    (4) Either one of the merging partners has total assets of  more than 100 billion yen, and the total assets of the other  partner are over 10 billion yen.    Section 3. Factors to be taken into consideration when  examining merger applications -- a final decision will be made  by taking comprehensive factors into consideration, depending on  whether the form of the merger is horizontal, vertical, or mixed.    (1) Horizontal mergers -- mergers that may be questionable  under the Antimonopoly Law are mainly horizontal mergers; in  such cases, 1) below will be given the most importance, a) under  2) will be given secondary consideration, and b) to d) under 2)  will be of a supplementary nature.    1) Market share after the merger -- market share after the  merger, the resulting overall position of advantage in the  market, and its relative position compared to its competitors;  and a comparison of these three factors to that before the  merger to see the degree of change; and import volume will of  course be taken into consideration.    2) The situation of competition in the market where the  merger will be doing business -- past trends and future plans  will both be taken into consideration:    a) The situation of competition in the market  concerned.    b) Business conditions in the market concerned.    c) Overall business capability of the merger.    d) The nature and environment of the market concerned.    (2) Vertical mergers -- in principle, factors to be  considered for vertical mergers are similar to those cited for  horizontal mergers, with the following included as additional  considerations:    1) Degree of closedness of the market concerned.    2) Degree by which barriers to market participation are  increasing.    (3) Mixed mergers -- for mixed mergers, in addition to  factors cited for horizontal mergers, the following will also be  taken into consideration:    1) Potential competitiveness among the merging groups.    2) Position of advantage after the merger.    3) Degree by which barriers to market participation are  increasing.    Section 4. Shortening of restriction period -- Japanese  companies cannot enter a merger less than 30 days after a merger  application is filed. However, cases satisfying the following  conditions will have a shorter period of restriction:    1) When it is evident that competition will not be  restricted as a result of the merger.    2) When there are valid reasons to shorten the period of  restriction.</p>

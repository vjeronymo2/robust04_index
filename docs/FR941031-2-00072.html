Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement and take other appropriate action, or make final the agreement's proposed order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This matter concerns the labeling and advertising of the respondent's Funny Color Foam soap. The Commission's complaint in this matter alleges that Funny Color Foam soap is sold in an aluminum aerosol can with a plastic cap which is made from high-density polyethylene. The product contained the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) isobutane and propane and was then reformulated by substituting for the VOCs hydrochlorofluorocarbon_chlorodifluoromethane (HCFC&hyph;22). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission's complaint charges that the respondent made the following advertising claims while the product contained VOCs: ``ENVIRONMENTALLY SAFE Contains no fluorocarbons. Non-Irritant. Non-toxic.'' The complaint alleges that through such claims, the respondent represented without substantiation that Funny Color Foam does not contain any ingredients that harm or damage the environment. In fact, Funny Color Foam contained VOCs_chemicals that under many atmospheric conditions contribute to the formation of ground level ozone, a major component of smog.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The complaint also charges that the respondent claimed that its reformulated product contains ``NO FLUOROCARBONS.'' The complaint alleges that through this claim, the respondent falsely represented that because Funny Color Foam contains no fluorocarbons, it will not deplete the earth's ozone layer or otherwise harm or damage the atmosphere. In fact, Funny Color Foam contains the harmful ozone-depleting ingredient chlorodifluoromethane (HCFC&hyph;22), which harms or causes damage to the atmosphere by contributing to the depletion of the earth's ozone layer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the complaint charges that the respondent falsely represented that Funny Color Foam's aluminum aerosol can and plastic cap are recyclable. In fact, the complaint alleges, while the aluminum can and plastic cap are capable of being recycled, the vast majority of consumers cannot recycle them because there are virtually no collection facilities that accept aluminum aerosol cans for recycling and only a few collection facilities nationwide that accept the high-density polyethylene cap for recycling.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

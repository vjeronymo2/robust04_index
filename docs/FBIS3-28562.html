			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 8 KYODO -- The Finance Ministry [MOF]  on Tuesday [8 February] released a set of measures to help  financial institutions dispose of bad loans as part of the  government's new pump-priming package.    The administrative guideline attached to the new 15.25  trillion yen stimulus package focuses on liquidation of the  so-called "restructured loans," or loans for which banks have  reduced or suspended interest payments as part of a bailout  program for financially troubled borrowers.    The ministry said it will allow banks to set up a special  entity to shift their restructured loans to nonbank money  lenders such as housing loan companies.    The ministry also said it will expand the scope of a special  write-off reserve account to include loans that have a risk of  default.    These steps are designed to rebuild public confidence in  Japan's financial system which was substantially eroded  following the bursting of the speculation-driven "bubble  economy" of the late 1980s.    The latest package is expected to maximize the effects of  measures envisioned in an administrative guideline for the  financial industry unveiled in August 1992, a ministry official  told a press conference.    The amount of restructured loans held by Japan's 21 major  banks is estimated to far exceed some 14 trillion yen in  nonperforming loans they reported at the end of last September,  which has weighed heavily on their earnings.    Banks are not required to disclose the size of restructured  loans but are required to do so on loans to bankrupt borrowers,  nonperforming loans or those with interest payments in arrears  for six months or longer.    Currently, loans recognized by the Finance Ministry as bad  assets can be provided for in the special reserve account, in  which half the outstanding claims are free of tax. Ministry  recognition requires that loans be unrecoverable, such as those  to bankrupt borrowers.    Under the new step, banks will be allowed to use their own  judgment to write off risky loans on a taxable basis, the  ministry said.    The aim of the company tasked with liquidating restructured  loans is to help avoid sales of such loans to third parties,  which hamper smooth rescue of the troubled nonbank, the official  said.    A creditor bank sells to a new entity its loan principal to  a  nonbank at discounted prices that reflect market prices. The  bank then uses the proceeds to set up the entity.    The mechanism improves the bank's financial standing by  producing a tax-free loss equal to the gap between the principal  and the selling price.    The guideline calls for stable fund supply by financial  institutions.    Specifically, it says banks should adopt an accommodative  lending stance for small companies to meet their fund needs in  new business areas.    In order to promote bank lending, the package also  recommends  that banks boost their capital base through issuance of  preferred stocks and subordinated bonds.    The guideline says the Finance Ministry, in order to ensure  stable housing and land supply, will ease restrictions on real  estate-related lending.    It says the ministry will continue to ask financial  institutions to refrain from resorting to the sale of  stockholdings to generate profits ahead of book closing.    It encourages banks to step up use of Cooperative Credit  Purchasing Co., a debt-buying entity set up in January 1993, as  a way to smooth disposal of their nonperforming loans.    Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii, in a press conference, said  he hopes these measures will wipe out public concern over the  eroded financial system, particularly the huge amount of  nonperforming loans squeezing it.</p>

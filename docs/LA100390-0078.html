			<p><P> October 3, 1990, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SOVIET UNION;  </P> <P> FIRED KGB GENERAL SUES FORMER BOSSES  </P> <P> A KGB general dismissed for his fierce public criticism and revelations about  the security service launched a lawsuit against his former bosses, saying they  had no right to strip him of his pension. Oleg Kalugin, 55, named KGB chief  Vladimir Kryuchkov and two other top officials in his action, calling the  denial of the pension an "inhuman act" taken as a reprisal. Moscow city court  adjourned the case until Oct. 23, pending information from the Moscow  prosecutor on KGB charges that Kalugin revealed state secrets by disclosing  details of the security service's operations in the United States.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: CARLSBAD  </P> <P> Three Carlsbad High School students testified Wednesday that they purchased  anabolic steroids from a teacher's aide during school hours.  </P> <P> After a preliminary hearing, Gregory Thomas Tirona, 31, was bound over to  Superior Court to stand trial on six charges of administering or selling  steroids.  </P> <P> The three minors all testified that they bought steroids from Tirona, also a  part-time coach, during late October and early November of last year. All three  said they paid $25 a bottle for the illegal substance, which they said they  purchased during school hours in front of Tirona's classroom.  </P> <P> In deciding that Tirona should face trial, San Diego Municipal Judge Fredric  Link said the evidence presented offered "more than a strong suspicion" that  Tirona sold the illegal drug to minors.  </P> <P> An arraignment and trial setting was scheduled for July 26.  </P> <P> Tirona, a Carlsbad resident, remains free on his own recognizance.  </P></p>

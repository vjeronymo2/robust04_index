			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Tory peer aims to extend scope of bill - War Crimes RECENT IRAQI war crimes and Second World War crimes in Japanese-held territories against UK subjects could be covered in the government's war crimes bill, if the bid to extend its remit succeeds. Lord Campbell of Alloway, the Tory peer who led the successful revolt against the bill last year, has tabled a motion to extend the bill to include war crimes committed in Iraqi-held territories since its invasion of Kuwait and in areas held by the Japanese during the Second World War. The motion would also allow amendments to try to ensure fair trials. This was a particular concern among peers in previous discussion of war crimes. It is the first time this arcane tactic of extending the scope of a bill in the Lords has been tried for more than 80 years. It was last used successfully in 1899. The move would meet the criticism that the bill is selective in the war crimes it brings within the jurisdiction of the UK courts. It is currently confined to war crimes committed in German-held territories during the war by people who are now British citizens or residents. But the rarity of the procedure invoked by Lord Campbell may deter some peers from supporting it. The bill is to be debated in the House of Lords at the end of this month. If peers throw it out, it will automatically become law under the Parliament Acts procedure as it has twice been passed by the Commons in successive sessions. The Lords rejected it last June by 207 votes to 74, a majority of 133. But if it is given a second reading the proposed extension of the bill could complicate its further discussion. Some of the arguments against it, relating to the difficulties of a fair trial so long after the crimes were committed, would not apply in the same way to trials for war crimes following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait last summer. The Home Office said yesterday that the Geneva convention of 1957 already gave the UK courts wide jurisdiction in respect of war crimes committed after the Second World War.</p>

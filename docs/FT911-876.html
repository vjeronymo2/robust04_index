			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / The Blue Arrow Trial: No attempt to deceive parent bank, jury told COUNTY NATWEST, the merchant banking subsidiary of NatWest Bank, made no attempt to deceive its parent bank over the handling of the Blue Arrow rights issue, the Blue Arrow trial heard yesterday. NatWest management had access to information about the matter from various sources and Mr Terence Green, the former NWB deputy chief executive, helped to redraft a County position paper from which any reference to a guarantee covering the holding taken in Blue Arrow by County NatWest Securities was dropped, the jury were told. Mr Leslie Collett, the former secretary to the County chairman's committee, agreed with Mr Alun Jones, QC, for Mr Stephen Clark, a County director, that nothing said at any meeting he had attended concerning Blue Arrow led him to believe NWB was misled. 'I do not believe there was any intention to mislead,' he told the court. When Mr Jones suggested it was 'transparently obvious' that the parent bank was fully informed of the situation, Mr Collett replied: 'It is clear they had information from various sources, yes.' Mr Collett agreed that at the end of November 1987 he met Mr Green to redraft the paper on the holdings the County group had taken in Blue Arrow. The paper was signed by Mr Charles Villiers, the former County chairman, and was to be submitted to the NWB chairman's committee. 'Mr Green read the paper and made one or two amendments before I took it back to County to have it retyped,' he said. Mr Jones asked whether it was Mr Green who had altered the letter to remove the reference to the indemnity given by County's corporate advisory division to CNWS. Mr Collett replied that he could not remember specific amendments, but it was 'quite possible' that was one of the changes made. He agreed with Mr Jones that Mr Green was 'very keen to get the paper right for his own board'. Mr Collett also agreed with Mr Jones that an argument had arisen within NWB over what should be told to its UK business committee, which included non-executive directors among its members. He agreed that, in conversation with Mr John Minto, personal assistant to Mr Thomas Frost, NWB chief executive, Mr Minto had discussed removing details of the original NWB loan to County to underwrite the rights issue from a report to the business committee. Mr Collett said Mr Minto supported a confidential approach and that that was opposed by NWB's domestic banking division, which preferred being open to the committee. He denied that it was obvious Mr Minto had been speaking on behalf of Mr Frost. Mr Minto could have been speaking for Mr Frost, Mr Green or Mr Charles Green, another NWB deputy chief executive, he said. County NatWest, NatWest Investment Bank and UBS Phillips &amp; Drew Securities deny conspiring to mislead the markets over the outcome of the September 1987 issue. The trial continues today.</p>

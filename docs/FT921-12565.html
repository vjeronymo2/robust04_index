			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Books: The man who met the hour RIGHT OR WRONG? by Richard Lamb Bloomsbury Pounds 16.99, 400 pages 'EVERY FIT male should be made to fight and die for victory . . .' Churchill cabled one of his generals after a setback in the Western Desert. And then to his resident minister in Cairo: 'Everyone must fight exactly as they would if Kent or Sussex was invaded. Tank hunting parties with sticky bombs and bombards . . .' If most people's impression of Winston Churchill is of a man of great energy and courage, over enthusiastic in seeking to attack, but lacking patience and judgment at critical points, then Churchill As War Leader - Right or Wrong? will confirm it. The 'right or wrong' addendum is a bit flashy: as this detailed and scholarly sifting of the records makes abundantly clear, most questions about the conduct of the war admit of no such either/or answer. The author elaborates many errors of judgment on Churchill's part but his overall verdict, as might be expected, is highly laudatory: 'Without him Britain would have succumbed in 1940. No other British statesman could have created the same faith in victory and inspired the nation to fight on wholeheartedly when all seemed lost . . . Despite many blunders and hasty, impetuous decisions, only one verdict is possible. He was a great wartime leader.' What then is the value of Richard Lamb's new account? It is that by focussing on certain key issues of the war in which Churchill chose to make a personal intervention, his role and his contribution are highlighted. Thus, in backing the speediest possible evacuation of British forces from Dunkirk, in supporting aid to Stalin, in provoking of Japan so as to bring America into the war, he was 'right'. In the sinking of the French fleet at Mers-el-Kebir, in the weakening of British strength in Malaya which led to the fall of Singapore, in encouraging the use of atomic bombs against Japan, he was 'wrong'. A minor but revealing case was his support of Admiral Sir Roger Keyes. A naval hero of the Zeebrugge raid of 1915 in the First World War, Keyes had the kind of swashbuckling zest for adventure exactly calculated to appeal to Churchill, who appointed him Director of Combined Operations. Keyes conceived the idea of seizing Pantellaria, a small island between Sicily and Tunisia. Churchill was completely swept away by his enthusiasm, despite the opposition on strong military grounds of the Chiefs of Staff. In the end the operation never took place, but that did not stop Keyes constantly importuning Churchill. Other schemes of his included invasions of the Azores and the Canary Islands, the Channel Islands and Casablanca, and towing concrete towers out to sea as anti-submarine forts. In the end, and against his instinct, Churchill was forced to dismiss Keyes. This reads (now) more as a comic interlude whereas some of the major mistakes of the conduct of the war have had a lasting effect. The misunderstandings, for instance, documented at length in so many histories and memoirs, which arose with the French and General de Gaulle. Their origin stemmed could not rely on Admiral Darlan's promise that he would sink his ships rather than allow the Germans to seize them. At Mers-el-Kebir the French fleet was put out of action and many French seamen lost their lives. 'The French have never forgiven Churchill and the verdict of history must be that by ignoring Admiralty advice . . . he prejudiced the Allied cause . . . almost his biggest wartime error,' says Lamb, adding that official histories are not to be trusted on this episode. It is obvious that in the heat of decision-making, as in the heat of battle, mistakes will be made. When it came to recording what happened, Churchill himself was often at pains to disguise his role, when he realised he had been wrong. 'Relentlessly,' he was prepared to suppress minutes and falsify his own memoirs, claims Lamb. He also put pressure on official historians to conceal chunks from the archives. For all this, Churchill's feats are in a sense enhanced by his shortcomings which were, so clearly, the obverse of his great virtues. Readers of a generation born after the war, with no direct memory of those cataclysmic times may wonder why these old battles should be argued over again by contemporary historians. The answer is that they were extraordinary times, and Churchill exercised extraordinary leadership. The man met the hour.</p>

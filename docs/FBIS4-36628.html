			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The indictment against Samir  Ja'ja' and others contains the results of the interrogations of  the detainees and the information available to the competent  security and judicial authorities. It reveals that many of the  accused have received training in Israel and that they had links  with Israeli intelligence. The interrogations also showed that  some of them are accomplices in other crimes, such as the  assassinations of Dani Sham'un and Dr. Ilyas al-Zayik and the  attempted murder of ministers Elie Hubayqah and Sulayman  Franjiyah. The indictment points out that the accused possessed  forged passports and travelled between Cyprus, Juniyah [port in  Lebanon], and Israel. It also stresses that the accused  received huge amounts of money for implementing their tasks at  the direct orders of Ja'ja'.</p>

			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / World Trade News: EU steel 'dumping' row European Union steelmakers are to file an anti-dumping complaint, alleging Czech and Hungarian structural steel suppliers have under-cut EU prices by up to 50 per cent. The east Europeans increased their EU market share almost threefold to 9 per cent last year, and had captured 27 per cent of total German sales by the final quarter, the Dusseldorf-based federal steel association said yesterday. Czech suppliers had been particularly aggressive, it added, raising their share in Germany from an aver-age 5 per cent in the first nine months of 1993 to more than 18 per cent in the final quarter. The complaint regarding structural steel, widely used in construction, will be posted later this week by the EU's Eurofer industry group, which will claim unfair tactics are costing western steel companies DM320m (Pounds 130m) a year. According to German data, Czech manufacturers had an average 1.7 per cent share of the EU market for structural steel in the first three quarters of last year. This climbed to 5.1 per cent in the final three months and had fallen to 4.6 per cent in the early part of the current year, association officials said yesterday. The Hungarians' share had gone from 1 per cent to 3.2 per cent and had latterly eased to 3 per cent. Latest figures showed Czech suppliers' share had slipped to 16.7 per cent in Germany, while the Hungarians had maintained their stake at 9 per cent. Meanwhile, the German association said further possible complaints were under investigation. Suspicions had been roused, for example, by data showing imports of finished steel products from the Czech Republic had more than doubled in the first quarter of this year.</p>

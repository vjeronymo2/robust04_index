			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Warburg director to retire MR PETER Wilmot-Sitwell is to retire as vice-chairman of SG Warburg and chairman of Warburg Securities following the merchant bank's next annual meeting, scheduled for June next year. He will, however, remain a non-executive director at Warburg Securities. Mr Wilmot-Sitwell will be succeeded by Mr Nick Verey. Mr Wilmot-Sitwell is widely viewed as one of the architects of the few post big-bang successes among UK merchant banks and broking firms. As senior partner at Rowe &amp; Pitman, the stockbroker, he was instrumental in forging the alliance between R&amp;P with Warburg, the merchant bank, Akroyd &amp; Smithers, the stockjobber and Mullens, the gilt-edged specialist.</p>

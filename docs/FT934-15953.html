			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / International Company News: Laidlaw's ADT stake in question THE ABRUPT departure of the chief executive of Laidlaw, the North American waste services and school bus operator, has raised a question mark over the Ontario-based company's stake in ADT, the international security services and vehicle auction group. Laidlaw is the biggest single shareholder in ADT, with a stake of 24 per cent. Analysts predicted yesterday that the ADT investment will be an early candidate for disposal as part of the shake-up which is expected to follow the installation of a new CEO. Mr Donald Jackson, 49, who has been chief executive for almost four years, will sub-mit his resignation at a board meeting on October 13. His departure follows what the company described as 'differences of opinion concerning Laidlaw's strategic direction'. A spokesman declined to give further details, beyond saying that Mr Jackson has returned to his native province of Alberta for a few days. A successor will be named after next week's meeting, indicating that someone has already been chosen. Laidlaw is 47 per cent owned by Canadian Pacific, the Montreal-based transport and resources conglomerate. News of Mr Jackson's departure was generally welcomed in the investment community. 'I don't think anyone is going to be disappointed that he's leaving,' one New York analyst said. 'He always managed around the edges without cutting into anything.' Laidlaw's share price edged down 13 cents to close at CDollars 7.88 on the Toronto stock exchange yesterday. Mr Jackson earlier this year described Laidlaw's stake in ADT, which was acquired under his predecessor Mr Michael DeGroote, as a 'portfolio investment'. ADT's businesses are completely different to Laidlaw's, which has reinforced speculation that the Canadian company would be willing to part with its ADT shares. The new CEO is also expected to review Laidlaw's relations with Attwoods, the UK-based solid waste handler in which it has a 35 per cent interest. It is uncertain however, whether the review will result in the sale of the Attwoods stake or closer links between the two companies. Laidlaw is the third biggest solid waste and recycling operator in the US, while Attwoods ranks fourth. Laidlaw was one of Canada's fastest-growing companies in the 1980s, but has suffered in recent years from the slump in the North American waste management business and the legacy of its earlier rapid expansion. It suffered a USDollars 33.6m loss in the three months to May 31, including a Dollars 120m write-down on its solid waste business. Fourth-quarter earnings are due to be published after next week's board meeting. One analyst predicted that the company will do little better than break even.</p>

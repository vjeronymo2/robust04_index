			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Energy Secretary James D. Watkins said he has moved back the timetable for  resuming production of a scarce gas needed to make nuclear warheads. He assured  Congress the delay would not weaken the national defense. Watkins said he hoped  to restart production at the Savannah River reactors, near Aiken, S.C., early  in 1990. The three reactors, which have been plagued by safety and technical  flaws, are the nation's only source of tritium, a perishable, radioactive gas  that boosts the explosive power of warheads. More retraining of reactor  operators and a fuller assessment of other safety issues are needed before the  plant can be allowed to resume operation.  </P></p>

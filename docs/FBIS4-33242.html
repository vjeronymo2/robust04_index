			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Ungovernable Fiefs"] </F>   [Text] If anyone had any doubts that state enterprises have  become ungovernable states within the Brazilian state, those  doubts were dissipated by the appalling disclosure that the  directors and administrative councils of 17 state enterprises  linked to the Transport Ministry converted their salaries to the  URV [Real Value Unit] when it peaked in April, thus violating  the provisional measure that had set the conversion at an  average value.    Vexed by the violation of the provisional measure by  organizations within the government itself, President Itamar  Franco ordered the immediate dismissal of the administrative and  human resources directors and the members of the administrative  councils of these state enterprises.    The directors directly involved with jobs and salaries, who  have the responsibility of defining salaries in the enterprises  considered rebels, have been dismissed until all the  irregularities and the directors' responsibility have been  investigated and in order to prevent a beheading of management  within the enterprises.    At the same time, the government has ordered that a clean  sweep be made in state enterprises and the public administration  to see whether the conversion of salaries to the URV was made  with the average of the months of December, January, February,  and March as outlined in the provisional measure, or whether the  conversion was made at the peak with the last salary in March  and in real cruzeiros.    Moreover, this will not be the last clash between state  enterprises and the presidency. A nationalist due to his  political breeding and a historic defender of state enterprises  in Brazil's development, Franco has been disenchanted several  times with the conduct of those enterprises' employees: "The  state enterprises belong to the Brazilian people, not just a  half a dozen people," he blurted out at the beginning of last  year, when he demanded clear- cut accounting by Petrobras  [Brazilian Petroleum Corporation].    Last year, when the Planning Ministry asked state  enterprises  to submit the roster containing the salaries paid to employees  and the benefits they receive, only a small number of the 150  enterprises, foundations, and autonomous companies controlled by  the Treasury promptly complied with the request. More than two  months passed until the list was complete, with the  corresponding wear and tear for authorities.    Because it is the country's largest state enterprise,  because  it has a complex accounting system, and because in addition to  it own activities it acts as the cashier for Alcohol Production  Program, Petrobras has been in the center of the tug of war  between the government and the state enterprises. And by 27  May, the special commission named by the government to audit  Petrobras' accounts had not been able to comply with the  commitment of submitting a complete report on the enterprise's  situation to Mines and Energy Minister Alexis Stepanenko.    More than the lack of official confidence in the Treasury's  control, which generated an immediate corporate reaction by  Petrobras' employees, the government always favored the  enterprise because it always wanted to assess the weight of the  taxes on the final price of fuels in order to help the  consumer's pocket and eventually to free Petrobras from the  weight of that unjust tax onus. The lack of submitting  clear-cut accounts has boomeranged against the enterprises.  Public enterprises should never be afraid of the public.</p>

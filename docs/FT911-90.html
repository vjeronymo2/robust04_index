			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Labour rules out drastic reform for accountancy THE LABOUR party is unlikely to seek immediate and drastic reforms of the UK's accountancy profession if it wins the next election, the party's discussion paper on its plans for accountants and auditors made clear. In the paper, Ms Marjorie Mowlam, opposition City spokesman, states that the current regulatory regime, whereby auditors are to be monitored by the professional bodies under the Companies Act 1989, is unsatisfactory. But the remedies put forward in the document fall far short of those being expounded by Mr Austin Mitchell, Labour MP for Great Grimsby and a former frontbench spokesman, who has attacked the accounting status quo. Yesterday's document shows that Labour has no immediate plans to curtail the consultancy work done by firms of auditors for their audit clients, or to insist on the rotation of auditors after a fixed period. These are among the more radical reforms advocated by Mr Mitchell. The document welcomes the recent improvements to the way in which accounting standards are set and monitored. It suggests that similar improvements ought to be made to the regulation of auditors. 'There is no doubt that the current institutional arrangements are unsatisfactory,' the document says. 'There is a need for (more input from outside the profession) and generally greater transparency of proceedings and recommendations.' The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England &amp; Wales yesterday challenged the view of Sir Gordon Borrie, director-general of fair trading, that the proposed regulations restricting non-auditors to ownership or control of no more than 25 per cent of auditing firms are uncompetitive. The institute told Mr John Redwood, corporate affairs minister, that the restriction was essential to safeguard auditors' independence.</p>

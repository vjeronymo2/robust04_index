			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> This is in rebuttal to David Boatman of La Canada (Viewers' Views, April 23),  who complained about the "inane banter" KNBC anchors Kelly Lange and Keith  Morrison carry on with other reporters. My husband and I disagree with him. We  thoroughly enjoy the friendship and rapport among those people, so much so that  we switched from Channel 7 to Channel 4. We also could not stand to listen to  Bill Press on Channel 7 any longer.  </P> <P> Mr. and Mrs. Phil Van Westen, Lynwood  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: BANKING / FINANCE: TWO COUNTY BANKS WILL CLOSE BRANCHES FOR LACK OF  BUSINESS  </P> <P> Banks are always looking to expand, but more bricks and mortar aren't always  the answer.  </P> <P> Two Orange County banks, for instance, are each closing a branch office by the  end of the year because the amount of business doesn't justify the expense of  maintaining the buildings.  </P> <P> CommerceBank in Newport Beach has sent letters to customers of its El Modena  branch in Orange saying that it will close the branch by the end of the year  and transfer their accounts to the downtown Orange office. The branch came with  the bank's acquisition of California City Bank earlier this year.  </P> <P> The $8 million in deposits at the east side branch was well below the bank's  average of $50 million per branch, said Clyde Gossert, the bank's president. In  addition, the bank is primarily a business bank that holds large deposits from  relatively few customers, and the El Modena branch holds mainly consumer  checking accounts.  </P> <P> Landmark Bank in La Habra, meantime, is shutting down its Santa Fe Springs  branch and moving the accounts to its main office. The Santa Fe Springs branch  had deposits of $5 million, considerably lower than roughly $25 million at  other branches.  </P> <P> Craig Collette, Landmark's president, said the bank is consolidating its  commercial services -- the prime activity at Santa Fe Springs -- in the main  office. It plans to open two branches in more promising areas in west Orange  County and west Riverside County.  </P> <P> The branch closings must first be approved by state banking regulators.  </P></p>

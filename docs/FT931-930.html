			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Nigerian parties to meet as democratic rule nears NIGERIA WILL take a step closer to democratic rule this weekend, when the country's two officially permitted political parties each choose a candidate for presidential elections in June. The party conventions, beginning today, are the penultimate stage in the fourth attempt to end seven years' military rule with a peaceful transition to elected civilian government, set for August 27. Most of the structures for civilian rule are in place. There are elected local councils and civilian governors in all 30 states. The national assembly's members have been on full pay since last year but they have no legislative powers until a president has been elected. Both the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and the National Republican Convention (NRC) are the creations of President Ibrahim Babangida, who has promised that before restoring democracy to Nigeria he will purge civilian politics of corruption and create a new group of politicians fit to run. The previous presidential campaign ended abruptly in October when the government disqualified all candidates for electoral fraud less than two months before the polls. Primaries began again in February under a complex new system designed to produce leaders with grass roots support and to reduce blatant vote-buying. The government has written both parties' manifestos and neither gives a clear sign of ideology or policy direction. The campaigning at local government and state level so far has centred on ethnic, religious and personal loyalties, and there has been virtually no debate on the national issues which a future president will face in office. After a decade of military rule and three postponements of the handover in three years, most prominent civilians with experience of government are either barred from standing or have not entered the race. Some of the leading candidates who were disqualified last year, such as Mr Musa Yar'Adua in the SDP and Adamu Ciroma, remain influential behind the scenes. Mr Moshood Abiola, a frontrunner for the SDP, is a Yoruba businessman from the south-west and proprietor of the Concord newspaper empire. His main party rival is Mr Baba Gana Kingibe, a former ambassador and director of the intelligence service. Both leading contenders for the NRC, businessman Bashir Tofa and physician Dalhatu Tafida, are northerners with connections going back to the defunct National Party of Nigeria.</p>

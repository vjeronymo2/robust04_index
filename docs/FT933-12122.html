			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Barclays narrows top job list to UK candidates BARCLAYS has narrowed its shortlist of potential new chief executives to British candidates, although it is thought still to be considering senior executives who are working overseas and outside commercial banking. Barclays, which is seeking an outsider to split Mr Andrew Buxton's joint role as chairman and chief executive, also fears that it will be unable to announce the appointment by the time of its interim results next week. Mr Buxton has discussed with candidates on the shortlist how responsibilities would be divided. The fact that US bankers or other foreign candidates have been excluded is significant because Sir Denys Henderson, the non-executive director who led the search, emphasised when it started that the bank would look around the world. Mr Richard Braddock, former president of Citicorp, and Mr Tom Johnson, former president of Manufacturers Hanover Corporation, were among US bankers thought likely to be considered by Barclays. The delay in the appointment has come in spite of Mr Buxton's hope when the search started in March that it could be completed within three or four months. If no announcement is possible at the interim results on August 5, Mr Buxton is likely to try to quell anxieties among shareholders about lack of progress by emphasising that the bank is close to appointing a chief executive. However, directors are concerned that disclosure of details of the search would risk making it more difficult to sign a contract with the candidate selected. The shortlist is not thought to be confined to bankers. Directors believe that an outsider, either at a senior level in a financial services company, or with financial expertise in another industry, might be appropriate. Mr John Tugwell, chairman of National Westminster Bank's US retail bank NatWest Bancorp, was among those approached by Spencer Stuart, Barclays' headhunting firm. But Barclays is thought to be considering other British executives who are working abroad. Barclays started its search after pressure from institutional shareholders to split the roles of chief executive and chairman. The bank has also been under scrutiny following its declaration of a Pounds 242m pre-tax loss for last year. Although Mr Buxton will retain a final say in strategic decisions subject to approval by the board, he is thought to expect the new chief executive to take an active part in discussions on the bank's strategy and structure. Mr Buxton believes the role of chairman and chief executive is too large for a single person. Barclays said yesterday that it could not comment on the progress of the search.</p>

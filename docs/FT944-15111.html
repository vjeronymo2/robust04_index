			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Asia's developing nations hungry for private investors' billions Asian governments at the World Infrastructure Forum in Jakarta yesterday called on private investors to take a leading role in financing ambitious plans for development of their transport and telecommunications sectors. Indian officials said that by 1997 their country wants to achieve its target of allocating telephones on demand, a programme requiring investment of more than Dollars 8bn. 'This is beyond the capacity of the government funding and generation of resources,' he said. 'Private investment and associations of the private sector would be needed in a big way to bridge the resource gap.' The officials said that for the telecommunications sector to play its assigned role in the country's development, it needs to increase its telephone connections to 60m from the present 8m 'as rapidly as possible'. That will require an estimated investment of Dollars 60bn. While basic telephone services are still lacking, Indian officials said they are also inviting private investment to set up value-added services. A tender is being prepared to invite technical and financial help in setting up cellular mobile phone services outside the main cities of Bombay, Delhi, Calcutta and Madras. Indonesia said it needs Dollars 12.5bn over the next five years to develop transport infrastructure, including roads, railways, inland waterways, sea port facilities and airport facilities. Indonesia also announced plans to invest more than Dollars 1bn by the year 2005 on water projects in Jakarta. Of this, Dollars 200m would be spent on distribution improvements alone. 'Under these circumstances, efforts should be made to encourage and stimulate private sector participation,' an Indonesian official said. Some 44 per cent of the requirement for Indonesian transport infrastructure development is expected to come from the private sector. The remainder is expected to come from state-owned companies, the government and foreign loans. The Indian government yesterday announced it is tendering for nine projects amounting to 167km of a high-speed tram system in the Delhi area. It is also offering projects on a build-operate-transfer basis for five bypasses, with an estimated cost of Dollars 70m, eight bridges which will cost about Dollars 147m and nine express-ways costing an approximate Dollars 3.5bn. The Philippines listed 175 potential projects worth over Dollars 14bn which are likely to be tendered on a build-operate-transfer basis for highways, transportation, power generation, water systems, tourism, industrial estates and waste management. The Asian Development Bank estimates that Asia needs about Dollars 3,000bn in infrastructure investment between now and 2010 if each country is to achieve its projected economic growth target.</p>

			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Arts: Summer listening - Spoken Word / The latest batch of audio tapes TOP of my list for summer listening is Anthony Trollope's The Last Chronicle of Barset, first published in 1867 (Cover To Cover Cassettes CTC 061; 23 cassettes; 31 hours; unabridged). This is the story of the Rev Josiah Crawley, perpetual curate in the parish of Hogglestock, learned, impoverished and proud, who is accused of dishonesty over a cheque for Pounds 20. The charge turns out to have been founded on a misunderstanding, but his agony while awaiting trial at the assizes is appalling, and his wife and daughters suffer with him. A magnificent reading from Timothy West, to round off the sequence of novels that he has made so very much his own. From Isis Audio Books, The Ladies of Missalonghi by the Australian Colleen McCullough (TE 432; 4 cassettes; 5 hours 15 minutes; unabridged) is nicely read by Davina Porter. the tale is set in the early years of this century in a small town in the Blue Mountains, which is ruled by the founder's male descendants. Unattached or widowed women have a thin time, until Missy, 33 and unmarried, and not even looking like the rest of the family's women, starts a revolution - a cheering fairy tale for grown-ups. Lake Wobegon Days and Leaving Home are two of the phenomenally popular chronicles of a small Mid-Western town written by Garrison Keillor. The author reads the stories himself on the radio, both here and in the US, and the BBC Radio Collection has released these two together in a limited-edition boxed set (ZBBC 1293; 4 cassettes; 4 hours). Lake Wobegon takes itself seriously, but its creator is one of the funniest and most endearing writers reading today. Hear him, if you have not already done so. John Galsworthy's Forsyte Saga seems to have an unending attraction. The part-dramatisation broadcast on BBC radio and now issued as a boxed set (ZBBC 1252; 6 cassettes; 9 hours) offers yet another account of the story of the three generations of Forsytes, and their money, beginning in 1886. Dirk Bogarde's delectable reading as the narrator supplies the romantic colouration that the story itself rarely achieves, and Sir Michael Hordern as Old Jolyon, the one genuinely warm heart In the entire chronicle, heads an excellent cast. Only Diana Quick's Irene slightly disappoints. In collaboration with BBC Drama, Random Century Audiobooks has issued the recording of Kenneth Branagh's Renaissance Theatre's production of Hamlet (RC 100; 4 cassettes; 3 hours 30 minutes), broadcast in April on Radio 3 and reviewed at that time. Suffice to say that it is an imposing addition to Random's catalogue. (I did not like Ophelia much, nor her brother, but perhaps one wasn't intended to.) Argo has reissued a recording of Shaw's Pygmalion (Argo 1298; 2 cassettes; 1 hour 45 minutes; edited) made some years ago but still worth hearing, with Diana Rigg as Eliza, Alec McCowan as Higgins, Jack May as Pickering and Bob Hoskins as Alfred Doolittle with strong supporting cast. The message about specific pretensions of the middle classes is dated, but the jokes are still good, and the acting has the right Shavian crispness. On the subject of acting, Simon Callow reads a shortened version of his own book Shooting the Actor (Random Century RC 79; 3 hours), his diary of six weeks spent in Yugoslavia in 1987, acting in the film Manifesto under the direction of Dusan Makavejev and watching the steady deterioration of their professional relationship. Makavejev's comments on the diary are incorporated. A first-rate clash of personalities, but with something learnt on both sides. To return to fiction, Tim Pigott-Smith's reading of Jules Verne's Around The World In Eighty Days (Argo 1310; 2 cassettes; 2 hours 45 minutes; abridged) is brisk, expert and hugely enjoyable. Of course, it is a rattling good yarn and the ending still breathless, after almost 120 years; and we still half-believe the caricature of the imperturbable gentleman, 'a man of heart', as we all know, 'when he has the time'. Another period piece from Argo, Jerome K. Jerome's Three Men On The Bummel (Argo 1304; 2 cassettes; 2 hours 15 minutes; abridged) was published in 1900 as a sequel to Three Men In A Boat. Bicycling in Germany was rather less jolly than camping on the Thames, but the candid account of Germany, and the Germans, at the turn of the century is full of interest. Apart from one or two overblown accents, Jeremy Nicholas's reading is comfortably companionable. Once again it is possible to hear the late Poet Laureate, Sir John Betjeman, reading his 1960 blank-verse autobiography, Summoned By Bells (BBC Radio Collection ZBBC 1249; two cassettes, 2 hours), and to be astonished yet again at how much of the man and his period and background are preserved In it, like flies in amber. An immensely enjoyable listen. Virgin Records has issued four CDs of Betjeman reading his poems (12 on each CD) to music composed, arranged and conducted by Jim Parker: Banana Blush (CASCD 1086; 39 minutes); Late-flowering Love (CASCD 1096; 43 minutes); Britain (CASCD 1130; 42 minutes - includes Hunter Trials and A Subaltern's Love Song) and Varsity Rag (CASCD 1154; 46 minutes). An appealing set, with the poet's (slightly diffident) showman side prettily complemented by the music. The recordings date from 1974-1981; Betjeman died In 1984. Jill Balcon and the Rasumovsky String Quartet have recorded an agreeable anthology on CD, The Sunlight On The Garden (Imperial Sound RAZCD 901), with Louis MacNeice's elegiac poem of that title and passages from Vita Sackville-West, Gertrude Jekyll, Laurie Lee, and others, and music which includes Puccini, Haydn, Britten. (Ignore the small mistake in the opening line of Jill Balcon's beautiful performance, since we all know that Francis Bacon, Lord Verulam, actually wrote about ' ..the purest of human pleasures', with an 's'.)</p>

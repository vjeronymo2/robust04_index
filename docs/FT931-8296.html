			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow ends lower after a volatile session Wall Street US PRICES were in mixed form yesterday following the announcement of President Bill Clinton's economic package, although secondary stocks, which were particularly hard hit earlier in the week, made a comeback, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was finally down 10.00 at 3,302.19, ending a rollercoaster session in which the index had at one point been up 35 points, and then down almost 35 points. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost 1.40 at 431.90, while the Nasdaq composite performed well, rising 3.02 to 662.45 on bargain buying. Trading volume on the New York SE was 311m shares. After the big sell-off on Tuesday the dominant feeling yesterday was one of relief that the State of the Union speech did not include nasty surprises. Taken together with further good news on the economy - industrial production up 0.4 per cent in January and weekly jobless claims down sharply - share prices saw strong early gains, lifting the Dow more than 35 points in the first few minutes of trading. The buying, however, quickly evaporated, at least among blue chip and large to medium-sized stocks. The general reaction to the economic package was that it was much more bullish for bonds than equities, while concern that higher taxes will retard economic growth continued to trouble investors. Consequently, the main indices gave back their morning gains, and by early afternoon the Dow had plunged to a 34-point drop, but blue chip prices eventually recovered most of their losses. Leading Dow stocks were mixed, with General Motors down Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 38 1/2 , Philip Morris up Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 70 5/8 , International Paper off Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 63 7/8 and Merck up Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 37 7/8 . Merck aside, most other big drug shares were lower, still worried about possible government-imposed limits on pharmaceutical prices. Schering-Plough slipped Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 56 3/4 and Bristol-Myers Squibb lost Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 56 1/8 . Airlines were hard hit by news of the energy tax and worries that higher personal taxes will stifle demand for air travel. Delta fell Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 46 7/8 , AMR Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 57 and UAL Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 115 3/4 . On the Nasdaq market, Intel led the way higher, rising Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 110, followed by Apple, which put on Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 55. Canada THE Toronto market showed a mildly negative reaction to US President Clinton's speech on his economic plan. The TSE 300 index shed 8.3 to 3,409.4 and falls led rises by 303 to 289 after volume of 53.5m shares.</p>

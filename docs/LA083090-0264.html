			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NEWTON'S JUDGMENT AGAINST NBC OVERTURNED;  </P> <P> LIBEL: APPEALS COURT RULES THAT EVIDENCE FAILED TO SHOW MALICE TOWARD SINGER,  WHO HAD BEEN AWARDED $5 MILLION.  </P> <P> A federal appeals court today dismissed Las Vegas singer Wayne Newton's  $5-million libel judgment against NBC, ruling that the evidence failed to show  malice toward Newton.  </P> <P> The original $19-million jury verdict was the largest libel award in American  history.  </P> <P> Three NBC stories in 1980 and 1981 claimed Newton had financed his 1980  purchase of the Aladdin Hotel with mob money and that organized crime figures  were the hidden ownership behind the resort.  </P> <P> A Las Vegas jury found National Broadcasting Company Inc. guilty of defaming  Newton in the broadcasts and awarded him $19 million in damages.  </P> <P> The trial judge in February, 1989, reduced the amount to $5.2 million.  </P> <P> The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals today unanimously ruled in a 50-page  opinion, "Our review of the uncontroverted testimony, together with the  cumulation of the circumstantial and documentary evidence, reveals almost no  evidence of actual malice, much less clear and convincing proof."  </P> <P> Newton's lawyers had argued at the time of the trial that the network had a  "total absence of institutional conscience." The Newton lawyers said the  stories were designed to curry favor with "Tonight Show" host Johnny Carson.  </P> <P> Carson lost out to Newton in a bid to buy the Aladdin Hotel and Casino in Las  Vegas in 1980.  </P> <P> Testimony indicated that the $85-million Aladdin purchase was funded by the  Valley Bank of Nevada.  </P> <P> Sued along with NBC were journalists Brian Ross and Ira Silverman, who were  involved in the story.  </P> <P> NBC attorney Floyd Abrams said during the trial that Newton created his own  problems by turning to crime figures Guido Penosi and Frank Piccolo for help in  halting death threats against his family.  </P> <P> Newton argued that NBC showed malice by publishing statements that Piccolo was  a hidden partner in Aladdin despite having Nevada Gaming Board testimony that  Valley Bank financed the purchase.  </P> <P> The appeal court noted that testimony also showed that hidden interest in a  casino is normally not actual ownership of a hotel but an interest in the  "skim, the amount of casino receipts not reported to the appropriate  authorities as receipts."  </P></p>

			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / International Company News: O&amp;Y Developments files debt restructuring plan OLYMPIA &amp; York Developments yesterday filed details of its November debt restructuring plan in Ontario Court, but some bankers and bondholders said acceptance in a mid-January vote was by no means certain. In Toronto, O&amp;Y said the filing was based on the November proposal under which senior creditors could claim their collateral at any time. This eliminated an earlier provision that would have delayed this right for five years and required further capital injections into O&amp;Y's flagship office towers in Toronto. Under the new plan, senior creditors could take back O&amp;Y properties immediately and O&amp;Y would become a management company controlled by the Reichmann brothers. Besides the main Canadian properties, creditors could also seize O&amp;Y's stock in Abitibi-Price, the Canadian forest products group, Gulf Canada Resources, an energy company, and Trizec, Canada's largest publicly-traded property holding company. About 34 creditor groups will vote on the plan in the week of January 11. Meanwhile, O&amp;Y remains under bankruptcy protection in Canada. O&amp;Y is negotiating separately to restructure its US property holdings. Several bankers and bondholders, who did not wish to be identified, said if creditors refused the plan, for closure proceedings could begin immediately as institutions rush to seize collateral. A vote in favour would mean acceptance of what amounts to an orderly liquidation of the O&amp;Y Canadian business under which further negotiation might be possible. BCE has raised total proceeds of about CDollars 377m from the exercise of share purchase warrants for common shares of TransCanada PipeLines, AP-DJ reports. BCE, the Canadian conglomerate, said its investment in TransCanada had been reduced to about 9 per cent.</p>

Government spokesman  Dieter Vogel said at the federal news conference in Bonn on  Monday [28 February] that the Federal Government is confident  "that it will really not be stopped." The four aircraft downed  by NATO F-16 planes had clearly violated the flight ban imposed  by the United Nations over Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Vogel stressed that the invading aircraft had been warned  twice. They ignored the warnings. Only then was were they fired  on. According to all facts that have become known so far, NATO  adhered to the instructions and rules that are laid down in UN  Resolution 816. According to it, all necessary means to  implement the flight ban are permitted. In this respect, NATO's  course of action is a "bitter, but necessary and resolute  conclusion of the behavior of the pilots who were subsequently  downed," he said.    A Defense Ministry spokesman reported that German officers  had, as usual, been in the AWACS reconnaissance aircraft that  guided the NATO planes to their operational positions. The  operation is legally permitted by the Constitutional Court  ruling of 8 April last year. The ruling covers both  reconnaissance and the control of the fighter aircraft, it was  stated.</p>

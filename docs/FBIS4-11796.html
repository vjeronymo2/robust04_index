			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by military correspondent Eytan Rabin] </F>   [Text] Under agreements achieved yesterday in Cairo, the  IDF [Israel Defense Forces] will permit the international force  due to deploy in Hebron to set up constructions, such as  observation points and offices. Members of the force will be  free to drive their cars about and to perform various  construction-related tasks without IDF intervention.    A senior military source said last night that he did not  think the IDF would be able to complete the Gaza evacuation  within 72 hours. "The new plan approved by the IDF indicates  that from the moment the Gaza and Jericho agreement is signed,  or from 13 April, the IDF will require three weeks to complete  its withdrawal. We need this time, and we will not be able to  carry out the task in less time," he said.    The military source stressed that the evacuation of Army  buildings and bases from the Gaza Strip, which was launched in  recent months, was not a comprehensive evacuation and it did not  include the evacuation of operational infrastructure. According  to the IDF plan, no operational troops are to pull out of the  Strip as long as no agreement has been signed.    According to the new plan, the evacuation agenda will be as  follows: In the first stage, the Hof 'Aza detention facility;  in the second stage, the hotel in which policemen are quartered;  later, small bases scattered throughout the Strip; in the fourth  stage, observation posts and outposts; and in the last stage,  the division and brigades command.    "There will be no actual evacuation until the agreement is  signed. We are reducing the number of our troops, but not those  of operational nature," the senior source said yesterday.    The implementation of the new evacuation plan began  yesterday  with the evacuation of Ansar 2, the Hof 'Aza detention facility.  The Palestinian detainees and prisoners held in this facility  will be moved to Qezi'ot prison. The military source said  yesterday that the whole facility will very soon be handed over  to the Palestinian police. As soon as the facility is cleared,  the Army will evacuate the hotel used as night quarters by Gaza  District policemen and as an office building.    Rather than demolish the evacuated buildings, the IDF leaves  them intact, including their electricity and water mains. The  IDF has not sold any equipment to the Palestinians, and all the  equipment will be moved out. The military source said that the  Army continues the construction of new installations in the  Qatif Bloc concurrently with the evacuation. Some settlements  have agreed to the IDF's building the installations inside their  boundaries.    The General Staff Logistics Branch has decided not to call  up  extra reserve troops for the evacuation. The evacuation process  is being assisted by officers who participated in the evacuation  of the Sinai bases, and an attempt is being made to apply the  lessons learned there to the Gaza situation.    The IDF has begun evacuating facilities in Jericho as well.</p>

			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (3): Financial training for the new generation - John Chelsom, professor of engineering management at City University, tells Andrew Baxter about ways of making engineers more at home with finance and communications / Interview: Professor John Chelsom One of the many criticisms lobbed at the UK education system over the past decade or so is its failure to produce enough engineers with the right financial and communications skills to make it to the top in British industry. The resulting dominance of senior boardrooms by accountants and finance men is, in turn, seen as a symptom of all that is wrong in UK industry and a reflection of the confusion over who engineers are and what their status should be. But while all sorts of commentators, academics and government officials identify a need in the UK for more engineers who are financially aware, it is not something that can be achieved overnight. Even so, Prof John Chelsom looks on the whole situation as an opportunity rather than a disaster area. A former purchasing director at Ford of Europe, Prof Chelsom can remember several promising UK machine tool companies in the 1970s which were run by engineers. 'About 80 per cent of them went bust,' he says, 'largely because these very good engineers did not have even enough financial training to realise they needed more financial expertise. They also lacked the financial training to deal effectively with their sources of finance, such as the High Street banks.' Since July 1991, Chelsom has been professor of engineering management at City University, giving him an important role in the battle to produce engineers who can manage. It is by no means an impossible task, he says: 'Engineering training does equip people extremely well to be excellent managers. It is a lot easier to turn an engineer or a person with a technological background into a very good manager than it is to turn, for example, a social scientist who is a good manager into someone who appreciates the technology issues.' This is particularly relevant, he says, in an era when technology issues are widely seen as being among the most important business drivers. 'Senior executives have learnt the financial skills of management, but now when confronted by the implications of technology, and having to develop parallel technology strategies along with business strategies, they are not really equipped to do it.' Having engineers in senior positions in industry is not only beneficial because they will then encourage their companies to adopt practices such as concurrent engineering and rapid prototyping, he says. Some of the methods of analysis used by engineers for designing products can also be applied to a business. City University is taking a twin-track approach to developing engineering managers. The engineering management content of its undergraduate engineering degrees courses has been increased in recent years. 'We hope that people are leaving here with a grounding in management issues, rather than just being an expert in some particular aspect of engineering,' he says. The other group being targeted is postgraduates, for whom an MBA in engineering management began in 1989. This is aimed at graduate engineers or the equivalent, and contains all the usual constituents of an MBA programme but with an engineering industry slant. The course, full time for one year or part-time for two years, will equip technicians and engineers for development into senior managers, says Prof Chelsom. There are, naturally, challenges to be surmounted in producing the supply of engineering managers that the UK needs. For one thing, says Prof Chelsom, business developments point to the need for people who are multi-skilled and can work in mixed groups - 'We're trying to give engineers a chance of doing that in academic surroundings, by problem solving, learning about communications, making presentations, as well as giving them the information to develop skills,' he says. Yet, he adds, the mechanism for delivering this information, in terms of government funding, does not provide the means for realising the identified needs. 'There seems to be more and more compartmentalisation.' Another problem area he identifies is the relationship between industry and academia. Here, he says, there have been some welcome developments through the increase in participation by senior engineers from industry as teachers in universities. This can take two forms, the late career change or part time involvement, and both bring the 'real world' into the lecture room and have been followed extensively at City University. There is also increasing use of academic engineers in industrial research. What is missing, though, is continuous interchange that involves young academics in the management of engineering companies. Something is being done about this through the Teaching Company Scheme, a partly-government funded scheme under which academics supervise recent graduates working in business and industry, but this is project related and may not expose the academic to corporate management issues. Improving engineers' communication skills is seen by Prof Chelsom as particularly important because, he says, the shortage of such skills is often the reason why engineers lack the confidence to go forward into senior management. He quotes the view of one senior UK engineering director who says he wants the education of engineers to enable them to shine in groups that include lawyers, accountants and others. Another challenge, he says, is to find ways for engineers from small and medium-sized companies - often seen as the UK's best growth opportunity - to participate more easily in engineering management courses. In particular, he says, the financing structure of grants for postgraduates puts an embargo on part-time programmes, but many engineers from such companies could not afford to be away from work full-time. But Prof Chelsom insists that there is already evidence of how engineers can reach senior positions in industry which do not necessarily involve engineering, at companies such as ICI and British Gas. 'That could be more widely known,' he says, 'and might influence the selection of engineering as a potential career, and as a subject for study.' And, he says, 'we have to be optimistic about the next five years, otherwise the last five have been in vain. There are signs that more and more companies recognise that an engineering degree should have a strong element of management.</p>

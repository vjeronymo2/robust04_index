			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Jobs may be shed at Independent THE Independent and The Independent on Sunday are starting a cost-cutting campaign that could lead to the loss of between 40 and 50 jobs. One of the main options under consideration is integration of the daily and Sunday papers into a seven-day operation while keeping the two titles in being. Alternatives include raising new money or bringing in new investors. Options will be considered at a board meeting of Newspaper Publishing, the holding company, next Wednesday. Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, editor and chief executive of The Independent, insists there is no possibility of closing or disposing of The Independent on Sunday. 'It is our title, and there is no question of it being sold,' he said yesterday. He is in no doubt, however, that action on costs is required because of the depth of the advertising recession. The management has indicated that any redundancies will be voluntary. Even before the Gulf war, display advertising on the two titles was 20 per cent down on an annual basis with a similar decline for classified space. Although there was a modest recovery when the war ended, April was a poor month and there is still no sign of growth. In spite of the recession The Independent has remained in modest profit since the start of its financial year in October. But the company is suffering heavy losses at The Independent on Sunday, which was launched just over a year ago. 'The arithmetic is remorseless,' Mr Whittam Smith said. Unions at Independent Television News have been warned that staffing levels are under review as part of this year's budgeting process. Mr Bob Phillis, chief executive of the television news organisation, said there could be redundancies among the 900 staff. It is unlikely that the number involved will be decided before next month's board meeting.</p>

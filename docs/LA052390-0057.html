			<p><P> May 23, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REPORT TO BUSH URGES DRILLING DECISION DELAY  </P> <P> President Bush's top-level task force has recommended that he indefinitely  delay decisions on whether to allow oil drilling off the Southern and Northern  California coasts until more scientific studies are completed, according to a  copy of the task force report made available to The Times.  </P> <P> The report suggests that Bush either defer or cancel plans to permit drilling  off the shores of California and Florida, but stopped short of recommending  that it be banned forever, as some environmentalists and California public  officials have advocated.  </P> <P> It also concludes that drilling off California and Florida might provide as  much as 2.1 million barrels of oil a day and replace as much as $40 billion in  imported oil over a 30-year period.  </P> <P> The President, who met with opponents of drilling from the California  congressional delegation last week, has promised to announce his long-awaited  and politically sensitive decision shortly.  </P> <P> The report, presented to Bush last January but never made public by the White  House, said existing information on potential sales of oil-gas leases off  California and Florida was too inadequate to justify a federal government  go-ahead for exploration and development.  </P> <P> In a finding sure to be welcomed by opponents of drilling, the report said:  "The Task Force concludes that although many of the environmental effects of  oil and gas activities, taken individually, are acceptable, collectively they  could result in unacceptable changes to the local environment in or near the  (proposed drilling sites) unless new measures are taken to control or mitigate  such effects."  </P> <P> Discussing the conflict between protecting the environment and promoting energy  development, the report said: "Based on its review of available information,  the Task Force concludes that additional time and effort are needed before  environmental concerns can be resolved in a manner that provides an acceptable  balance between these two goals."  </P> <P> Rep. Barbara Boxer (D-Greenbrae), who made a copy of the report available to  The Times, said it was great news for opponents of offshore drilling since it  amounted to an "environmental indictment" of this form of oil and gas  development.  </P> <P> "I hope the President will read this report and decide to grant permanent  protection to the magnificent coastal areas that are threatened with drilling,"  she said. "If he proceeds with any lease sales off California after this  report, he will be completely missing its point."  </P> <P> The task force was chaired by Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. and included  Energy Secretary James Watkins as well as William Reilly, administrator of the  Environmental Protection Agency; John Knauss, head of the National Oceanic and  Atmospheric Administration, and Richard Darman, director of the Office of  Management and Budget.  </P> <P> They reported to the President on potential Lease Sale 91, ranging from north  of Sonoma County to the Oregon border; Lease Sale 95, from San Luis Obispo to  the Mexican border, and Lease Sale 116, off the southwest coast of Florida.  </P> <P> Boxer said the recommendations also should apply to Lease Sale 119 -- off the  Central California coast from San Luis Obispo to the north end of Sonoma County  -- but the task force report did not cover that area.  </P> <P> In the report, task force members said the Minerals Management Service of the  Department of Interior had spent more than $41 million on environmental studies  for these three areas during the past 15 years.  </P> <P> "Nevertheless, the Task Force finds that some additional studies . . . are  needed before the Secretary of Interior makes leasing decisions in the three  areas," the report concluded. It said a special inquiry conducted by the  National Academy of Sciences' National Research Council found shortcomings in  the amount of oceanographic, socioeconomic and ecological information available  regarding the California and Florida coastal areas.  </P> <P> In some cases, the report noted, more information about possible effects of  offshore drilling will help to resolve public concerns about the practice.  </P> <P> "In other cases, additional environmental protection measures need to be  developed, perhaps even tested, before leasing decisions proceed," the report  said. "New working relationships and institutional arrangements may be needed  so that affected local communities have more influence on leasing, exploration  and development decisions."  </P> <P> In spelling out other measures that could be taken, the task force recommended  a requirement that offshore oil be transported in pipelines instead of tankers  "where feasible and environmentally preferable."  </P> <P> It also said contingency planning, risk assessment and response capability for  oil spills should be improved. And it urged stronger protection of sensitive  areas.  </P> <P> "Because some of these measures could be instituted only at considerable cost  to lessees (oil and gas producers), taken together they could substantially  reduce the benefits of developing oil and gas and could discourage the industry  from bidding for the right to Outer Continental Shelf resources," the report  added.  </P> <P> The task force also recommended that air emissions from drilling facilities off  the California coast be subject to more stringent controls -- roughly  equivalent to standards applicable to onshore installations.  </P> <P> The report presented Bush with several options for each of the two California  coastal areas. For Southern California, it said the government could proceed  with preparations for a lease sale, but defer a final decision until additional  scientific studies are available.  </P> <P> Another option would be to cancel the proposed sale and defer future leasing  decisions until the studies are finished, while establishing more stringent air  quality controls and toughen oil spill contingency plans for offshore  facilities.  </P> <P> Or, the task force said, Bush could put off leasing decisions until a new  five-year leasing program begins in 1992 and offer tracts only in the Santa  Maria Basin and San Diego Outer Basin in the next sale off Southern California.  </P> <P> Yet another option would exclude the Southern California area from  consideration in the new 1992-97 leasing period after cancellation of sale 95,  putting off drilling until late 1997 at least.  </P> <P> For Northern California, similar options were proposed to defer or cancel the  sale of leases. Under one plan, tracts in the Eel River Basin would be offered  in 1992-97. Another option would exclude the Northern California area from the  next five-year leasing period.  </P></p>

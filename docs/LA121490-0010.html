			<p><P> December 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IRAQ NEGOTIATIONS  </P> <P> The picture on the front page (Dec. 6) of Secretary of State James Baker with  scowling face and pointing finger says it all.  </P> <P> Baker is from Texas and obviously is trying to play the role of top gunslinger.  The Persian Gulf crisis, however, should not be treated like a shoot-out on the  plains. America and the world need more than a cowboy in the saddle. We need a  diplomat with a world view.  </P> <P> PETER W. MASON  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

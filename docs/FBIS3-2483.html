			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Special feature" by reporter Zhang Suifeng (1728 4482 </F> 5762): "Views of Taiwan Commercial, Academic Circles on Impact  of Breakdown of Sino-British Talks Over Hong Kong's Political  Reform"]    [Text] Hong Kong, 25 Feb (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Since the  Sino-British talks over Hong Kong's political reform broke down,  Taiwan academic and commercial circles have been concerned about  its impact on the across-strait and Taiwan-Hong Kong  relationships but most people believe that the relationships  will not be affected too much from a long-term point of view.    Huang Li, a law professor at Taiwan National Chengchi  University, who has been involved in drafting the "Regulations  on Taiwan Relations with Hong Kong and Macao," believes that  though the Hong Kong Legislative Council yesterday passed the  partial political reform package tabled by Hong Kong Governor  Chris Patten, Hong Kong's basic political setup will not undergo  great changes when it returns to Beijing rule. Unless Beijing  plans to recover sovereignty over Hong Kong ahead of schedule,  the passage of the partial bill will not produce too great an  impact on the Taiwan-Hong Kong relationship, he said. However,  he maintained that the Chinese side is unlikely to recover  sovereignty over Hong Kong ahead of time.    Yeh Ming-te, a researcher at Taiwan National Chengchi  University International Relations Research Center, said that  the dispute between China and Britain does not mean Hong Kong  will be in a precarious state and the principle of "one country,  two systems" will go down the drain. Beijing will not give in  on political matters and political principles because this is  where the essentials of "one country" lie, he said, adding that  on economic matters, including the mode of production, it will  adopt a flexible attitude to give expression to the "two  systems."    Commenting on the possible change in Hong Kong and on the  establishment of new "Taiwan-Hong Kong relations" after 1997,  Yeh maintained that Chinese in Taiwan should expand their  cooperation and exchanges with Hong Kong in social and economic  fields with the purpose of deriving Hong Kong's experience in  "internationalizing management" and bringing benefit to the  Chinese nation.    According to Wu Hsin-hsing, an associate professor at  National Cheng Kung University Political and Economic Research  Institute and a member of the Mainland Committee Consultative  Committee, the strained Sino-British relations will have direct  and indirect influences on the following: The negotiations on  the renewal of the agreement on navigation rights between Hong  Kong and Taiwan, which expires in 1995, because Taiwan may not  be able to find its counterpart for entering into the  negotiations at that time; over 3,000 Taiwan companies which are  registered in Hong Kong but do business on the mainland; the  entrepot trade between Taiwan and the mainland via Hong Kong;  and Taiwan's economy, because Hong Kong and Taiwan have  established close economic and trade relations and Hong Kong  businessmen have invested heavily in Taiwan's stock market. Wu  said that how great the impact will be remains to be seen.    Chen Fei-lung, convener of the Committee for Development of  Economic and Trade Relations between Taipei and Hong Kong under  the Taiwan Federation for Industrial and Commercial Enterprises,  and Chang Ping-chao, chairman of the Foundation for Development  of Across-Strait Commercial Affairs, believes that Hong Kong's  political situation will affect Taiwan business in Hong Kong and  on the mainland for a short time. However, they are optimistic  about Hong Kong's long-term situation. Chen stressed that since  the focus of the world's economic development has been shifted  to Asia, many people throughout the world are upbeat about the  outlook for economic development on the mainland. When Hong  Kong returns to Chinese rule in future, he said, China will  continue to export its commodities through Hong Kong. Taiwan  will have more close contacts with Hong Kong because of progress  in cross-strait economic relations and trade, he added.    Chang believed that though Hong Kong's current political row  has led to conflicts between the Chinese and British Hong Kong  Governments, it has had limited impact on Taiwan businessmen  because, though Taiwan businessmen are developing economic  relations and trade with the mainland through Hong Kong, they  only go through the necessary procedures for the entrepot trade  in Hong Kong rather than relying on the Chinese and Hong Kong  Government to do business. In addition, Beijing will try its  best to maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, he added.    However, Chang did not deny that Hong Kong's political row  will affect the stock market and property development, both of  which are very sensitive to political changes.</p>

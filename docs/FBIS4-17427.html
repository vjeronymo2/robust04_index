			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Apr 22, BNS -- Estonia is ready to go  ahead with the dismantling of the nuclear reactors in Paldiski,  Juri Tikk, the special government representative in Paldiski,  told BNS.    Tikk thought the dismantling of the reactors and removal of  nuclear fuel from Estonia might start early in May. He said the  Russian side has run into some difficulties with the technical  side of the operation, which prevents it from setting things in  motion. The Russian customs officials at Kingissepp have  detained a container without which the dismantling cannot begin,  Tikk claimed.    The government representative said that a Russian landing  ship stands ready in Paldiski's South Port to receive the parts  of the dismantled reactors.    Russia wants to conclude a joint agreement on the removal of  fuel and on the dismantling of the reactors. Estonia stands  firm that both operations must be regulated by separate  treaties. "We still don't know how (Russia plans) to handle the  dismantling of the reactors and their removal from Paldiski,"  Tikk said. But, he said, the removal of nuclear fuel has been  finalized down to the last detail.    BNS has information nuclear fuel will be removed from  Paldiski by rail. Tikk declined to conform or deny the report.  "Whichever kind of transport is used, safety will be guaranteed  in any case," he stated.    Tikk claimed the most hazardous stage of the operation is  opening of the reactor lid. "Yet, even if radioactive vapor  should escape, it won't pose a very great danger since the cloud  will disperse soon," he maintained.    Jan Christer Lindhe, a researcher from the Swedish National  Radioactivity Protection Institute, also voiced the opinion that  the reactors don't constitute a big threat to the environment.  "It's more of a political problem," he claimed.    "Should an accident occur, we shan't keep it secret," Tikk  declared. Estonia monitors continuously the radiation level  around the reactors and if something occurs there that the  Russian side would like to hush up, Estonia will spread the news  through all mass media channels.    The Estonian Government decided on April 12 to enforce a  special regime on the Pakri peninsula where Paldiski is situated  to ensure the safety of the dismantling operation and the  population.</p>

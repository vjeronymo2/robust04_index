			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by UKRINFORM correspondent Viktor Kovalenko for TASS] </F>   [Text] Kiev, 23 Jun -- Ukrainian Supreme Council Chairman  Aleksandr Moroz has said that he sees a solution to the problem  of the Black Sea Fleet in an arrangement whereby Russia and  Ukraine will execute joint command of the fleet but each side  would be responsible for the financial and organizational  aspects of running its share of the fleet. He said so at a news  conference today.    The Supreme Council head said that Ukraine's agreements with  the CIS countries ought to be deepened because they are not  working at the moment and no one is trying to make them work.  He said he was concerned with the fact that the world community  was attempting to turn Ukraine into an appendage supplying raw  resources, and spoke in favor of setting up and developing  self-contained production cycles in the state, which would meet  Ukraine's demand for the main types of industrial products.</p>

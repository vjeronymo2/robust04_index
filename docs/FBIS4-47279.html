Nesmeyanov, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow; UDC  541.64:546.659:547.571]    [Abstract] For the first time, polypinacols were  synthesized by reacting aromatic dialdehydes with samarium  iodide under mild conditions. Tere- and isophthalic aldehydes  and bis-(3-hydro-formyl-2,4,6-trimethylphenyl(methane) [BHPM]  that had been purified by vacuum sublimation were used as  starting monomers. Terephthalic aldehyde was reacted with  SmI[.sub]2[/] in tetrahydrofuran [THF] in an argon  atmosphere. Hydrolysis was performed with diluted hydrochloric  acid. A study of the effect of temperature on the reaction in  the temperature interval from -25 to +65C demonstrated that  a portion of the aldehyde groups do not participate in the  reaction at low temperatures (from -25 to -20C). Increasing  the reaction temperature to 5-7C results in a slight  increase in the polymer's logarithmic viscosity; however, once  again not all the aldehyde groups are involved in the  condensation. Finally, when the temperature is increased all the  way to 65C, it is possible to obtain a polymer of the  desired structure (i.e., a polymer with no absorption band at  1,680 cm[.sup]-1[/] and intensive absorption bands at  3,400-3,500 cm[.sup]-1[/]). The polymer's molecular weight  also increases slightly as the reaction temperature is raised;  however, the solubility in organic solvents of the polymer  synthesized at 65C is significantly diminished. The said  polymers only dissolve upon protracted heating in amide-type  solvents and lose their solubility when the duration of the  synthesis process at 65C is increased to several hours  (evidently on account of cross-linking at the hydroxyl groups).  The noticeable ash (samarium) content in the reaction products  was also deemed attention worthy. Increasing the concentration  of dialdehyde dissolved in the THF from 0.05 to 0.50 mol/l did  not result in any increase in the polymers' viscosity  characteristics but did increase the tendency toward formation  of coordination compounds with samarium (even those products  purified by reprecipitation contained samarium). The  polypinacols obtained from other dialdehydes and  SmI[.sub]2[/] under similar conditions were found to contain  carbon and hydrogen in quantities corresponding to the  theoretically calculated amount and no ash at all. This finding  was attributed to the fact that side processes expending OH  groups are suppressed as a result of steric factors and because  of the fact that the mutual effect of the aldehyde groups in  such cases is weak. The said compounds also had a lower  molecular weight than the polymers formed from terephthalic  aldehyde. This lower molecular weight was attributed to the  lower concentration of starting monomer on account of its  limited solubility in THF. The newly synthesized polymers on the  basis of BHPM were white powder materials, and those synthesized  on the basis of tere- and isophthalic aldehydes were yellow  powders. All had an amorphous structure, a softening temperature  of 160 to 190C, and a 5 percent mass loss in air at  200-230C. The polypinacols based on BHPM had the lowest  softening points and temperature of onset of heat destruction.  All of the newly synthesized polymers were distinguished by  their solubility in a number of organic solvents (those based on  BHPM were soluble in chloroform and even acetone), and all were  interesting as functional compounds from the standpoint of  subsequent synthesis of derivatives at their hydroxyl groups  (e.g., by reaction with isocyanates, etc., coordination with  organometallic compounds, and synthesis of poly-_a_-diketones  via oxidation). The possibility of modifying the newly  synthesized compounds by reacting them with aldehydes to form  polymers that are easily soluble in various organic solvents was  demonstrated.

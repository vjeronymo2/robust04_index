			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Smaller companies show big reliance on overdrafts Smaller companies appear to rely heavily on high-cost, short-term finance, says a Confederation of British Industry survey published today. It says that more than 57 per cent of respondents were using overdrafts to raise debt. The survey of the way small companies in Cleveland raise finance was produced in association with Cleveland County Council and Teesside University. It found that almost two-thirds of borrowing was for working capital, suggesting finance was sought to survive and meet cashflow difficulties rather than to achieve growth. Most borrowers required 'quite modest' amounts - Pounds 100,000 or less in more than three-quarters of cases. The most popular sources were clearing banks (64 per cent) and finance and leasing companies (35.5 per cent). The report concludes that banks should pay more attention to management skills and business prospects and put less emphasis on security when lending money. Finance Provision for Small Firms.

			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC CENTER GEARS UP FOR A GALA 25TH  </P> <P> A yearlong parade of about a Dozen events celebrating the first quarter century  of the Los Angeles Music Center was announced Wednesday by center officials in  the Grand Hall of the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.  </P> <P> The 25th-anniversary events range from free performances in the three  performing-arts theaters and a party on the plaza the night of Dec. 6 to swank  galas, a private Hawaiian weekend and a signed Sam Francis commemorative  lithograph for the very top donors.  </P> <P> The Music Center formally opened Dec. 6, 1964, when the Pavilion raised its  curtain for the first time with Zubin Mehta conducting the Los Angeles  Philharmonic and violinist Jascha Heifetz as soloist. The Mark Taper Forum and  the Ahmanson opened in April, 1967.  </P> <P> "We are indeed a better community, a better people, for what goes on in this  cultural campus," said Joseph Pinola, chairman and chief executive officer of  First Interstate Bancorp and chairman of the board of governors of the Music  Center.  </P> <P> The anniversary announcement, attended by political and arts officials, was  made in the same hall where last month the Music Center named Frank O. Gehry of  Venice, Calif., as architect of the Walt Disney Concert Hall, the $100-million  structure that will become the fourth building in the Music Center complex.  </P> <P> F. Daniel Frost, president of the Music Center Foundation and a co-chairman of  the anniversary event, traced the history of the Music Center and commended  "the public sector-private sector partnership" that became "a role model for  the entire country."  </P> <P> He then read a statement that Dorothy Buffum Chandler, the Music Center's  founder, wrote at the opening of the building that bears her name: "In a world  more immediately imperiled by mediocrity than intercontinental missiles, the  Music Center will stand forever as a symbol of what creative man can accomplish  when he sets high his standards and has vision far beyond our present  horizons."  </P> <P> Frost added that on Tuesday he had spoken with Mrs. Chandler about the  25th-anniversary celebration activities, and read to her from a history of the  center that had been prepared for the Disney Hall architectural subcommittee.  </P> <P> Frost said she told him: "I can hardly believe that 25 years have passed so  quickly. I don't think I could have done it if I had realized at the beginning  what was involved. And I certainly would not have been able to do it without  the loyal support of so many friends, the dedication of the Board of  Supervisors throughout and the understanding and total backing of my wonderful  husband, Norman.  </P> <P> "I feel very lucky to have had the opportunity to give something back to the  community that has given so much to my family and to me," Mrs. Chandler said.  </P> <P> Paying tribute to its future, the Music Center also announced establishment of  a newly formed International Council that will sponsor a 21st-Century Arts  Award program. Each year, the Music Center will seek out and pay tribute to  three outstanding young artists in music, dance and theater. "History is only  meaningful as a prelude to the future," said Music Center President Esther  Wachtell.  </P> <P> As part of the quarter-century celebration, a multicultural community arts  festival highlighting Southern California's diversity will take place on the  Music Center plaza July 8 and 9.  </P> <P> On Sept. 23, there will be a dinner for major donors and Music Center  officials. On Sept. 24, the center will feature its resident companies in an  anniversary performance in the Pavilion. The program will offer performances by  the Los Angeles Philharmonic, Los Angeles Music Center Opera, the Joffrey  Ballet, the Los Angeles Master Chorale and the Center Theatre Group/Mark Taper  Forum and Ahmanson Theatre. Nick Vanoff and Gary Pudney are producing the  event, which is expected to eventually become a television special.  </P> <P> Throughout the year, the center's resident companies will commemorate the  anniversary with special performances.  </P> <P> The Taper will dedicate three programs to the anniversary, including the world  premiere of "Sansei" on the main stage March 23 through May 7, created and  performed by the band Hiroshima.  </P> <P> In September, Music Center Opera will present Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht's  "The Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny."  </P> <P> The production was conceived for Los Angeles by British director Jonathan  Miller and Los Angeles artist Robert Israel -- or, as Livingston quipped: "The  setting of this will take place in Hollywood -- perfect!"  </P> <P> Nov. 30 through Dec. 3, the Los Angeles Philharmonic will present Stravinsky's  "Oedipus Rex" conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen and directed by Taper artistic  director Gordon Davidson. The Los Angeles Chorale will participate.  </P> <P> On April 22, the Los Angeles Master Chorale has designated its "Scottish  Highland Celebration" featuring Jean Redpath as its commemorative event.  </P> <P> Although Music Center officials were anticipating privately that  President-elect George Bush and his wife, Barbara, would be honorary co-chairs  of a "glittering gala" for 1,000 persons to follow the Sept. 24 performance, it  is uncertain whether they will be able to do so. While Pinola said with a smile  that Bush "went ahead and got himself elected," anniversary event co-chair  Nancy Livingston added: "It doesn't mean that that won't happen."  </P></p>

			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Whitegate Leisure returns to profit with Pounds 663,000 WHITEGATE Leisure, the entertainment and ten pin bowling group, announced pre and post-tax profits of Pounds 663,000 for the 12 months to August 31. In the previous period - covering the eight months to end-August 1992 - the group incurred losses of Pounds 8.72m, adjusted for FRS 3. The figures were struck after interest charges of Pounds 3.02m and Pounds 2.74m respectively. Adjusted earnings per share emerged at 6.5p (5.3p losses). The accounts were prepared on a going concern basis; a renewed agreement with the group's bankers lasting until end-September 1995 was reached on Tuesday whereby Whitegate will issue 3.19m shares at par to the banks, subject to shareholders' approval. The return to profit enabled the group to repay some Pounds 2m of bank debt since April 1. Borrowings currently stand at about Pounds 30m, expected to come down to below Pounds 25m by the end of next year. Turnover in the largest business - dancing - amounted to Pounds 13.7m (Pounds 6.41m) for operating profits of Pounds 4.37m (Pounds 970,000). Bowling contributed turnover of Pounds 6.34m (Pounds 4m) and oper-ating profits of Pounds 2.32m (Pounds 1.46m). The group has finally divorced itself from the ill-fated move into France and is still seeking buyers for the remnants of its healthcare subsidiary. Options include seeking a separate quotation for the business which achieved profits of Pounds 231,000 (Pounds 137,000) before exceptional items. The group's intention was now to concentrate wholly on the UK mass market leisure business. To reflect its 'distinct regional identity' it proposes to change its name to Northern Leisure. Whitegate also intends to move from the USM to a full listing. The shares rose 4 1/2p to 43 1/2p.</p>

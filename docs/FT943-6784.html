			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading The derivatives sector had a strong session as dealers reacted to Wednesday night's sharp rise on Wall Street, writes Joel Kibazo. In futures, the September contract on the FT-SE 100 opened strongly at 3,246 with dealers trying to maintain the momentum set by New York's overnight performance. But a big seller within the first hour ended the early euphoria and sent the contract retreating to 3,235 mid-morning. This proved to be a brief set-back and good institutional demand helped September regain lost ground to move sharply ahead over the next few hours. A squeeze around lunch time sent the contract to the day's peak of 3,264 and light arbitrage activity was reported at around this time. September failed to hold above the 3,250 support level when Wall Street failed to continue Wednesday's strong rally and it closed at 3,243, up a net 18 and just ahead of its fair value premium to cash of about 6 points. Volume was 11,936 lots. The strong market trend boosted activity in traded options with most of the day's activity centred on the index options sector. Total turnover was 49,054 of which 11,880 was in the FT-SE 100 option and 11,909 contracts in the Euro FT-SE option. British Gas was the busiest stock option with 3,082 lots dealt.</p>

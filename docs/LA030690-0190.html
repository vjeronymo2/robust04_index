O'Connor blames heavy-metal rock music  for popularizing devil worship.  </P> <P> O'Connor said in his Sunday sermon at St. Patrick's Cathedral that "as far as  we know (the exorcisms) have been successful." O'Connor said heavy-metal music  "can help trap people, especially teen-agers," into devil worship. "I think the  industry had better police itself," O'Connor said.  </P></p>

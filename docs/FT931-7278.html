			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Letter: Price of coal Sir, The report from the electricity industry regulator ('Regulator deals blow to coal lobby', February 23), is the latest analysis which may drive us to conclude that the Department of Trade and Industry's response to the Coal Board's pit closure proposals was correct. Perhaps the question now is the political price to be paid for the Coal Board's flouting its obligations on consultation. Barry Henderson, 10 White Hart Court, Fairford, Glos GL7 4AG</p>

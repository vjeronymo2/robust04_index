			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Scottish bus group promise good behaviour Fife Scottish Omnibuses, part of the Stagecoach bus group, has given undertakings about its future good conduct after an Office of Fair Trading investigation found it had tried to remove a competitor from the market. The OFT found in March that Fife Scottish had acted in a predatory and anti-competitive fashion against subsidised services operated by Moffat and Williamson for Fife Regional Council. Fife Scottish has given pledges not to increase fares by more than the rate of inflation on the routes that were investigated and not to reduce the frequency of services. It will also not introduce new services in competition with those subsidised by its rivals. Stagecoach's active acquisition policy has led to frequent OFT investigations though it has been cleared in 16 of the 18 cases. It has, however, been required to give undertakings after mergers with bus companies in Lancaster and Sussex.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Location in Relation to Breeding, Spawning, Nursery, Feeding, or Passage Areas of Living Resources in Adult or Juvenile Phases [40 CFR 228.6(a)(2)] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many of the area's species spend their adult lives in the offshore region, but are estuary-dependent because their juvenile stages use a low salinity estuarine nursery region. Specific migration routes are not known in the Miami area. The site is not known to include any major breeding or spawning area, except for sea turtles which use the entire beach area of eastern Florida as nesting habitat. Due to the motility of finfish, it is unlikely that disposal activities will have any significant impact on any of the species found in the area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Location in Relation to Beaches and Other Amenity Areas [40 CFR 228.6(a)(3)] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The candidate site is located at least 3.6 nautical miles from the coast. Shore-related amenities include Virginia Key, the Biscayne Bay Aquatic Preserve, Biscayne National Park, and the Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Recreational Area. Currents in the vicinity trend alongshore in a general north-south orientation. It is therefore unlikely that detectable quantities of dredged material will be transported onto beaches. Considering the distance that the proposed disposal site is offshore of beach areas, dredged material disposal at the site is not expected to have an effect on the recreational uses of these beaches. Modelling performed by the COE indicates that disposed material will not impact these areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Types and Quantities of Wastes Proposed To Be Disposed of, and Proposed Methods of Release, Including Methods of Packing the Waste, If Any [40 CFR 228(a)(4)] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It is anticipated that the candidate site will be used primarily for disposal of maintenance material from the Port of Miami. Maintenance dredging has only occurred four times since 1957. Another foreseen use of the site would be the Miami Harbor Deepening Project. Estimated volume for this project is expected to be 6 million cubic yards. For each future dredging project, each disposal plan must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to ensure that ocean disposal is the best alternative and that the material meets the Ocean Dumping Criteria in 40 CFR Part 227.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Feasibility of Surveillance and Monitoring [40 CFR 228.6(a)(5)] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Due to the proximity of the site to shore, surveillance will not be difficult. Survey vessels, dredges or aircraft overflights are feasible surveillance methods. However, the depths at this site make conventional ODMDS monitoring techniques difficult to utilize. The Site Management and Monitoring Plan (SMMP) for the Miami ODMDS has been developed and was included as an appendix in the DEIS. This SMMP establishes a sequence of monitoring surveys to be undertaken to determine any impacts resulting from disposal activities. The SMMP may be modified for cause by the responsible agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Dispersal, Horizontal Transport and Vertical Mixing Characteristics of the Area Including Prevailing Current Direction and Velocity, If Any [40 CFR 228.6(a)(6)] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Prevailing currents parallel the coast and are generally oriented along a north-south axis. Northerly flow predominates. Mean surface currents range from 62 to 95 cm/sec with maximum velocities of about 150 cm/sec. Current speeds are lower and current reversals more common in near-bottom waters. Mean velocities of 3.5 cm/sec and maximum velocities of 27 cm/sec have been reported for near-bottom waters in the area. A pycnocline occurs in site waters throughout the year at reported depths ranging from about 60 feet in the summer to 325 feet in the winter. A dredged material dispersion study conducted by the COE for both the short- and long-term fate of material disposed at the proposed site indicates little possibility of disposed material affecting near-shore reefs. Measures as discussed in the Management and Monitoring Plan will be instituted during disposal operations to minimize the possibility of material being transported to the near-shore reefs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 7. Existence and Effects of Current and Previous Discharges and Dumping in the Area (Including Cumulative Effects) [40 CFR 228.6(a)(7)] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed ODMDS was used for the first time in April 1990. Only 225,000 cubic yards of maintenance material was disposed in the proposed ODMDS. In conjunction with this use of the site, the Corps of Engineers in cooperation with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) monitored the physical processes and the dispersive characteristics of the dredged material plume. Monitoring results indicated that the material discharged, except for a low concentration residual remaining within the water column, reached bottom within the designated site boundaries. During the monitoring, the resulting plumes were observed to be transported in a north to northeast direction. The full monitoring report will be included as part of the Final EIS. Due to the limited quantity of material disposed at the site, an effects study has not been initiated. Effects monitoring is discussed in the Site Management and Monitoring Plan as part of the EIS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No other discharges or dumping occurs in the site. The Miami-Dade Central publicly owned treatment plant outfall discharges approximately 1.2 miles west of the site. The effects from this discharge are local and predominantly in a north-south direction due to prevailing currents and should not have any effect within the site.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

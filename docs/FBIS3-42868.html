Russia inherited from the USSR the lion's share of its nuclear  potential, as well as the entire Soviet-American infrastructure  of control over armaments, along with corresponding obligations,  rights, and responsibilities; it inherited the Soviet doctrines  and concepts regarding the use of nuclear weapons, balance of  forces, stability, etc.    No less important is that which Russia is attempting to move  away from, to disavow. First of all, this includes the political  foundations of interaction with the United States in the nuclear  sphere according to the confrontation-rivalry model, which  determined both the development of USSR military potential and  its approach to control over nuclear arms. President B. Yeltsin  stated that Russia would like to consider the United States its  ally, not a competitor-enemy, and would prefer to see  international relations develop overall without the  participation of weapons of mass destruction. Secondly, this  relates to the Soviet style of elaborating and adopting  decisions on nuclear weapons matters, which used to be  characterized by centralism and secrecy.    In addition, the Soviet Union was a stable state, a factor  that created favorable conditions not only for the deployment of  weapons, but for the conclusion of agreements on arms reductions  as well. But today Russia must confront the numerous  consequences of the collapse of the Soviet state and  manifestations of instability in the regions.    Right alongside its new measures, Russia put the American  side in quite a difficult predicament, moving it towards equally  radical changes in military policy. The future of  Russian-American relations, including in matters of armaments,  depends therefore to a great extent on the desire and capability  of both sides to try to find a suitable balance between  continuity and innovation in this sphere. To what degree can the  experience of the Cold War period be retained, and what should  be rejected? This article makes an attempt to find answers to  these questions. Special attention is devoted to three aspects:  evolution of the strategic nuclear balance in the world;  different variations of the strategies of Russia and the United  States; the future of control over nuclear arms following the  end of the Cold War.  <H5>  The Changing Nuclear Landscape </H5>   The main attributes of one configuration or another of the  strategic nuclear balance in the world should include not only  the number of states possessing this variety of weapon and their  hierarchy in the "nuclear club" (by size and scale of arsenals  of the means of destruction and protection), but chiefly their  military-strategic orientation along the ally-enemy spectrum. If  we consider all the attributes of configuration of the balance  of nuclear forces in their aggregate, it can be asserted that  fundamental changes in the qualitative respect have not yet  taken place--for Russia's security in any case.    All nuclear weapons systems belonging to the United States,  Great Britain, France, and China, as well as those located in  the former Union republics of the USSR, have retained their  previous orientation on the whole, although the number of  targets for destruction in their territories is decreasing, and  do not exist at all today in the territory of former Warsaw Pact  allies of the USSR. As before, the nuclear weapons systems of  the United States, Great Britain, and France are aimed mainly at  targets in Russia. Their relationships as allies have been  preserved and efforts are being made to strengthen them. At the  same time, the entry of Russia into NATO is problematic, to put  it mildly.    Although large-scale in application, the START I and START  II  Treaties first of all have not been implemented; secondly, they  do not affect the main foundations of the balance of nuclear  forces in the world. The changes that took place following the  end of the Cold War affected the former Soviet nuclear potential  to the greatest extent, and the treaties on reductions did not  play the most important role here. As a consequence of the  collapse of the USSR, the reliability of this potential was  placed in doubt, i.e., guarantees of executing combat missions  in retaliatory operations, as well as its safety and security,  consisting primarily of the capability to impede unauthorized  access to nuclear weapons systems and prevent accidental launch  resulting from technical malfunctions or errors in the chain of  command and control. The nuclear potential transferred to  jurisdiction of the Russian Federation lost a portion of its  weapons systems and security systems (in particular, tracking,  early warning, command and control), facilities of the  production and testing base, and means of launching spacecraft.  True, as opposed to Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan, Russia can  replenish these insofar as it is denied peripheral elements, but  not central ones. However, this requires time and assets.  Maintaining the state integrity of the Russian Federation and  restoring the high degree of combat readiness of its army will  obviously also mean preserving the basic international standing  of the Russian state as a nuclear power.    At the same time, preconditions have today taken shape for  changing the configuration of the strategic nuclear balance in  the world. These consist primarily of the political nature of  relations between the two leading nuclear states--the United  States and Russia--and their abandonment of rigid confrontation.  These circumstances place on the agenda the question of a new  military-strategic orientation of nuclear potential, that of the  United States and its NATO allies first of all, but also that of  Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan. Political declarations  on their part are clearly insufficient. In order to effect a  true rejection of military confrontation, and not just its  mitigation, it is necessary to bolster political and diplomatic  steps through appropriate measures in the sphere of trade and  economic relations and in the specific plans of the military  departments. If the previous policy of targeting and selecting  priorities and programs for the development of systems of  nuclear destruction is maintained in principle, then political  relationships too will not be void of ambiguity and will perhaps  become reversible. It is clear that the qualitative improvement  of relations cannot be limited just to diplomatic steps and  quantitative reductions in armed forces and armaments.    But if the policy of the United States and Russia in  selecting targets for destruction and in planning the military  application of nuclear weapons changes radically, who then will  replace Russia as the main objective of United States' nuclear  restraint and on what scale? And if a suitable candidate is not  found, what then is to be done with the nuclear arsenal? Time  and colossal assets are necessary for its destruction. And if  the American leadership finds a worthy candidate for the role of  power to be restrained, will the United States and its allies be  able to ensure the efficacy of restraint with respect to other  states seen as a threat to the territory and interests of the  NATO countries? Serious fears exist on this account insofar as a  great deal depends on the perception of U.S. actions in other  countries which may be unprepared for the system of already  established values, rules, and conventions of confrontation.    Most likely, according to tradition, Russia will remain for  the time being the main objective of nuclear restraint on the  part of the United States and NATO, which means we will continue  to see the status quo in the configuration of the strategic  nuclear balance in coming years.    China may be thought of as another premise for change in  this  configuration, if its policies come to rely on narrowing the gap  between it and the leaders, building up the combat capabilities  of its nuclear potential according to qualitative or  quantitative parameters, expanding its involvement in regions  and spheres of international relations which presuppose  confrontation with other nuclear states, and finally,  consolidating security guarantees as a result of the possible  reorientation of former USSR allies against the last powerful  bastion of socialism. Ukraine might move the Chinese leadership  in this direction if it succeeds in achieving the status of  nuclear power, insofar as China would then be shifted from third  to fourth place in the hierarchy of the "nuclear club." Not  having nuclear allies and being limited in its choice of  military strategy alternatives by virtue of technological lag  behind Russia and in particular behind the United States, it  could rely on building up its own arsenal of nuclear forces. It  seems, however, that this supposition will remain unfulfilled.  In evaluating the prospects, it should be taken into account  that the United States and China have already established broad  economic ties, and despite his preelection statements, President  Clinton has extended the law affording China most favored nation  status in American-Chinese trade. Relations with Russia are also  intensifying, although it should not be forgotten that neither  broad economic ties nor diverse political and diplomatic  contacts provide a guarantee of prevention of military  confrontation. Such a guarantee can only consist of commonality  of national interests, a fairly extensive sphere of their  overlap.    An important premise for changing the configuration of the  strategic nuclear balance is impairment of the regime of control  and nonproliferation. Interaction between the leaders in Moscow  and Washington has its own prehistory in the establishment of  this regime. They achieved very great successes here. At the  beginning of the 1960's, at the height of the Cold War, the USSR  and United States were forced to acknowledge that not only was  it necessary for international relations overall to restrict the  number of states that might gain access to nuclear weapons, this  also conformed to the particular national interests of both  powers. The existing regime of nonproliferation is basically the  result of bilateral efforts. The persistence of these efforts  was a key factor, joining 140 states by 1990 within the  framework of the Treaty on Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons.  Despite extremely complex political relations, every year the  United States and USSR coordinated their policies in this  sphere. In 1989 the USSR and United States set about  accomplishing measures to fight nuclear terrorism.    At the same time, the opinion developed by the beginning of  the nineties that the efforts of both sides were insufficient to  meet the danger of the spread of nuclear weapons--this could  take place independent of the treaty. Certain countries--Israel,  India, and Pakistan, in particular--did not subscribe to it. In  fact, over the course of the entire Cold War period, a slow but  undeviating preparation was seen to take place for entry of new  members into the "nuclear club." Today it is not clear whether  or not the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty will remain in effect  after 1995. Moreover, it is difficult to name with absolute  confidence the precise number of nuclear powers. Contradictory  trends are being seen. Certain "threshold" states which are  regional rivals and centers of power have disavowed further  development of their nuclear programs (Argentina, Brazil, the  Republic of South Africa). This facilitates a lessening of  tension on the whole in the regions in question and a diminution  of the role of the nuclear factor in international relations  outside the framework of Russian-American understandings on  military issues. At the same time, other examples exist. In  particular, M. Gur, Israel's deputy minister of defense, stated  recently that in the event of a nuclear attack by one of the  Arab countries against Israel, the nuclear strike in response  would cause the aggressor significantly greater damage.  Available information indicates that Israel possesses about a  hundred nuclear rounds and the systems to deliver them.  (Footnote 1) (KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, 8 June 1993.) There is no  reliable data regarding the possession of such weapons by the  Arab countries. It cannot be ruled out that confrontation  between India and Pakistan, Israel and the Arab countries, or  North and South Korea, for example, would contribute towards  establishing several of them as nuclear states.    Do these prospects truly alarm the Americans, or is  discussion of this topic just a means of proving that their  nuclear weapons specialists and personnel on alert at launcher  facilities are earning their keep? Both are true, apparently. Of  course, a few dozen nuclear weapons available to India or  Pakistan, Israel or North Korea, can hardly be considered a  threat to American territory, even if intercontinental delivery  systems are found for these weapons. The interests of the  majority of "threshold" states are not anti-American in their  orientation. Clearly they do not need to compete with the United  States with respect to capabilities, or are not able to do so.    However, the point does not lie in the fact that disruption  of the nonproliferation regime would make American territory  more vulnerable or create a universal threat of nuclear  blackmail. For the United States there would be a narrowing of  the field of political maneuver, intervention, and resolution of  regional problems on advantageous terms. For it is well known  that U.S. national interests are not at all restricted to  inviolability of its territory, population, and social system.  These interests are significantly broader and extend far outside  the boundaries of the United States. Therefore, the  international relations situation that will prove stable for it  will be one that facilitates progress for American political  influence and capital and assists in securing a settlement of  problems and conflicts that is advantageous to the United States  and its allies. Naturally, the emergence of new nuclear states  does not contribute towards the growth of American influence.  Moreover, it may impede U.S. participation in international  affairs and foreign policy initiatives and may increase risk,  including by virtue of direct threat of eliminating American  military facilities in allied countries. In this manner,  opportunities for controlling and managing the development of  crisis situations that the American administration considers key  in ensuring stability are limited. In particular, North Korea's  intention to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty  has compelled the American side to make concessions, and in  return for agreeing to remain within the framework of the treaty  North Korea obtained the right to inspect American military  facilities in South Korea.    For Russia the problem of nonproliferation is not so urgent.  Why? First of all, retention of the regime of nonproliferation  has been beset with a great many conditions of third countries  which entail further concessions on the part of all veterans of  the "nuclear club," including Russia. The matter is not  restricted to cessation of nuclear testing. (Footnote 2) (In  July 1993 Clinton stated that the United States would not renew  testing unless another nuclear power did so. It is too early,  however, to draw final conclusions with respect to the U.S.  position insofar as the Congress has not repealed its previous  decision on limiting the number of tests, and American nuclear  arms proponents are exerting pressure on the administration in  favor of continuing an abbreviated testing program.) But it  seems that the latest (January 1993) treaty with the United  States on nuclear weapons reaches the limit of Russia's  capabilities in disarmament--this the result not so much of  military-strategic factors as of domestic economic and social  ones. It is not clear whether or not Russia will have the funds  and resources necessary to fulfill obligations already  undertaken, not to mention new ones.    Secondly, the prestige of Russia, having cut off almost all  ties with its former allies, and its influence on international  relations have been sharply curtailed as compared with what the  USSR used to enjoy. Control over the development of situations  in the "far" abroad and actively effecting their settlement do  not constitute a priority goal of Russia's strategy. The United  States is interested in this to a far greater degree--expansion  of the "nuclear club" is for it tantamount to reduced American  influence on the neighbors of new nuclear powers.    Thirdly, India, Pakistan, Israel, North Korea, and other  candidates for official membership in the "nuclear club" are not  directly in conflict with Russia. These powers can effectively  use the nuclear trump card only on the regional level, in  rivalry with their neighbors in whose direction their nuclear  warheads are primarily aimed. Those political and military  efforts of China or Pakistan, for example, which have an  anti-Russian orientation (exporting civil war out of Afghanistan  to the territory of the former USSR, supplanting Russia and  expanding their own zones of influence through direct or  indirect penetration into former Soviet republics), are carried  out mainly through third countries. Nuclear weapons can help  them very little in their relations with Russia, and this is  perfectly understood by all. Nor can Russia rely solely on the  nuclear factor in resolving these problems. It will apparently  have to travel along the same path the United States has taken,  long ago orienting itself on increased attention to conventional  weapons and general-purpose forces, to means of command and  control based on advanced military technologies, to intelligence  and communications, etc. While nuclear potential will remain for  both Russia and the United States "the final argument."    Ukraine, and to a certain extent Kazakhstan, present a  common  concern to them, insofar as a portion of the Soviet nuclear  arsenal remains on their territory. The problems these states  have, going through the difficult period of establishment,  create compelling motivation for the acquisition of nuclear  status. At the same time, they do not fully possess the  technical, production, or operational capabilities of becoming  nuclear states. This is impossible without assistance from  Russia. But such assistance can be afforded only under  conditions of relations with these states as allies. This has  broadened somewhat President Yeltsin's opportunity for flexible  policy. It is not the United States but Russia that could become  an equalizing influence in American-Ukrainian relations if it so  desired and exert significantly greater influence on the  international postures of both sides.    However, it is especially difficult to foresee all the  consequences of this right now. After all, the basis for  cooperation between the United States and Russia on the old  principles of rivalry have already become outdated, and a new  basis based on partnership has not taken shape. Cooperation  between Russia and Ukraine has also not been formulated as yet.  Therefore, in the interests of a positive continuation of  international relations and in their stability, it is necessary  first of all to devote greater attention to control over  armaments and to expand the circle of participants in this  process.    Activation of the mechanisms of control over all varieties  of  the weapons of mass destruction will probably show greater  resolution in revealing shifts in the configuration of the  balance of forces in the world and will define areas of  heightened risk.  <H5>  Variations in Strategy of the United States and Russia </H5>   Concern over bipolar nuclear parity will apparently shift to  the background in the coming period. The concept of strategic  stability reflected in practical terms in the START II Treaty  may become the basis--officially or unofficially--for  construction of the nuclear potentials of both the United States  and Russia. This means that the era of nuclear rivalry between  the two powers has entered the stage of extinction. At the same  time, the era of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,  including nuclear weapons, is only beginning, it seems.  Apocalyptic predictions regarding so-called "nuclear pygmies"  dictating terms and blackmailing the rest of humanity are  perhaps exaggerated, but it is necessary today to limit this  risk based on a new level of cooperation in efforts between  Russia and the United States.    Is such a new level of cooperation indeed possible? If we  are  talking about a fundamentally different basis of cooperation not  just of allies, but of partners formally striving to avert  confrontation, this is possible only if a radical review of  targeting policy takes place so that American and Russian cities  and other facilities are not the targeted objectives of the  nuclear missiles and strategic bombers of both sides. Without  such in-depth changes, or at least some parallel movement in  this direction, it is difficult to discuss a new era of  cooperation. It is important to take note of two circumstances  when examining this question.    First of all, a great deal regarding cooperative efforts of  the United States and Russia in the nonproliferation sphere  depends on what role will be played by nuclear weapons in the  world as a whole, and especially in the national security  strategy of the United States and Russia as the most powerful  nuclear states. There are many contradictory tendencies in this  sphere of policy. On the one hand, it is clear that nuclear  weapons cannot be a response to all threats, or even the  majority of them. They are not viewed as the universal means of  achieving national security strategy objectives, including those  of the United States and Russia. However, both Clinton and  Yeltsin emphasize in their official statements the important  role of the nuclear potentials of their countries, allowing it  to be understood that they have no intention of harboring a  nihilistic attitude towards these under today's conditions.  (Footnote 3) (Annual Report to the President and the Congress,  Department of Defense, Wash., 1993, p. 4-6, 15; KRASNAYA ZVEZDA,  11 June 1993. (Speech of President of Russia B.N. Yeltsin to the  leadership of the Russian Federation Armed Forces.)) If both  states move definitively away from confrontation with one  another--which presently has not yet taken place, as already  noted--but preserve their number one and two positions in the  hierarchy of the "nuclear club," the end of the Cold War will  then lead to a consolidation of nuclear multipolarity. The  remaining members of this club, especially countries of the  Third World, with which China categorizes itself, will view new  generations of American and Russian strategic offensive and  defensive systems in the best case as a guarantee against  devaluation of their strategic potential. But in the worst case  scenario, they will evaluate this as a direct threat, for which  it will be necessary to find appropriate countermeasures. The  premises will have been created for a resumption of the nuclear  arms race with adjustments for a new configuration of power  centers.    Secondly, if the United States and Russia radically alter  the  military-strategic orientation of their nuclear arsenals with  respect to each other and do not cling to nuclear leadership  here, there are grounds to hope that the acquisition or build-up  of nuclear potential will not become the military policy aim of  third countries.    It is difficult to be optimistic, however, for a number of  reasons. Even in the event of ratification of the START II  Treaty by the United States, Russia, and other former Soviet  republics, its implementation will take a decade. During the  course of this period of time it is entirely realistic to expect  scientific-technical breakthroughs in the military sphere in the  largest countries, including developing countries. Then towards  the beginning of the 21st century the prospect will arise of a  narrowing of the gap between the United States and the most  powerful regional centers of power. This is contrary to American  interests. Officials in the American administration have  asserted that the Pentagon's maintenance of indisputable  technological superiority continues to comprise an extremely  important objective of U.S. national security policy. (Footnote  4) (Annual Report...1993, p. VIII, 15.) The Americans will  continue to maintain and build up their scientific and technical  reserves in the arms race. And it is possible the nuclear  orientation will not be the fundamental one for them.    Whereas for other states, including U.S. allies, supporting  an advanced level of military technology in all the main  orientations and setting the tone in the selection of priority  orientations is hardly an attainable objective by virtue of the  far greater limitations in their scientific-technical and  financial resources, as compared with the United States.  Especially since a timely reorientation on nonnuclear aspects of  the arms race would be difficult to achieve for the less  powerful and less developed states. Those in this category that  have at least some sort of reserve of their own will either  continue along this path or they will withdraw, rejecting  independent participation in the arms race no matter what the  sphere of advanced military technology.    Understanding the possible benefits of this, including  economic benefits, the Americans will obviously prefer to settle  problems from a position of superiority rather than from one of  self-restriction in the choice of means of exerting pressure.  They can hardly be expected to themselves reject advantages over  others, risking failure in negotiations with unyielding  opponents, and find themselves without additional trump cards in  the event of one complication or another. As a consequence of  this, the nuclear factor in American national security strategy  will lose its weight not so much depending on improved relations  with Russia and a weakening of Russian might as much as on the  extent to which the United States secures new achievements in  the sphere of arms and acquires alternative, more flexible means  of guaranteeing its national interests.    Taking these perspectives into account, a narrow, egoistic  variant of U.S. foreign policy is entirely realistic. Such a  variant may be aimed at securing interests of the moment even at  the risk of endangering international stability. This does not  mean a return to isolationism in its pure form. Here the United  States could conduct an active foreign policy, but on principles  of unilateral advantage, in the interests of broadening its  spheres of influence in the Third World, including to the  detriment of Russia and even its own allies. Even following the  end of the Cold War the United States has been using the  multipolar balance in Eurasia with the aim of playing on the  contradictions among various power centers in the region. The  result of such a policy would be further disintegration of the  security system and extreme imbalance of the strategic  equilibrium. In this event, certain traditional bastions of  tension in the regions will spread out over the ruins of the  bipolar system and control of armaments will have limited  significance for all entities of international relations. How  will this influence Russian policy?    Having confronted American egoism and lost its status as a  superpower, Russia will likely lose interest in the bilateral  process of control over armaments and will instead prefer some  kind of variety of "nuclear isolationism," meaning complete  independence in the strategic sphere. In the event of such a  choice, Russia will follow in the path of France in the 1960's.  Not being in any condition to play according to the rules of the  nuclear superpowers, Paris totally rejected these rules.    If Moscow follows this path in the middle of the nineties,  the United States may then remain the one nuclear superpower  without partners in negotiations and without support in the  matter of nonproliferation. Such a variant seems more probable  for Russia, insofar as new orientations of the development of  U.S. nuclear potential relying on qualitative parameters with  respect to command and control, intelligence, and defensive  systems have gradually undermined the significance of parity  among the nuclear powers as the basis for negotiations on  nuclear arms. As a result, other criteria are being brought into  the calculation in the adoption of decisions concerning Russia's  defense, the most important of which are qualitative parameters  of nuclear forces as a guarantee for inflicting a responsive  strike. Taking these into account during the course of  negotiations is quite problematic in practical terms.    There exists a probability under today's conditions that  Russia will undertake unilateral measures to reduce its Armed  Forces and will change their structure. This is not so much a  question of unilateral reductions in nuclear potential as much  as the independent selection of a path of development of  strategic forces and the rejection of duplication of the  American weapons systems.    Another variant of American foreign policy can be termed  collectivist. This presumes that the United States will not  separate its own security interests from the security interests  of its allies and the entire world community. In this regard,  the basic aim of the United States will be to form an  international security structure of the "greater Europe"  variety, capable of stifling the numerous destabilizing impulses  of a chronically unstable South.    Of course, U.S. national security policy will in reality not  be a clear-cut choice between the first and second options. More  likely this will be a flexible combination of elements of both  depending on the political situation in the country and in the  world.    In a number of his speeches, new U.S. President Clinton has  stressed that his administration is proposing participation in  collective efforts to guarantee security. In the event  collective measures do not conform to the national interests of  the United States, however, they will prefer to act as they see  fit. An example of this can be seen in the American position  with respect to the crisis in Yugoslavia, where the United  States did not agree with Europe concerning maintaining an  embargo on arms shipments to the Islamic community, and sent a  military contingent to Macedonia as well. In this manner, a  claim was made on the role of equalizer with respect to German,  Turkish, and Russian policy in the Balkans, opportunistically  taking advantage of the "Islamic factor" which the United States  always uses to frighten the Europeans and Russia.    In analyzing the tendencies that are taking shape, we can  presume that it will be increasingly difficult to support the  collective principle in the realization of U.S. national  security strategy, even within the NATO framework, and the  nuclear doctrine of the bloc as the embodiment of this principle  will probably be subject to a durability test, insofar as the  ground is disappearing beneath its feet.    The technology factor may also come to play its role here.  It  seems that with the technical complexity and high cost of  antimissile defense systems and new military technologies of  offensive weapons, not all the nuclear powers will be able to  possess these, and over the course of 10-20 years a more precise  delineation will come about within the "nuclear club" between  first-class powers--which possess advanced technologies and  capabilities in command and control, communications,  intelligence, accurate delivery of nuclear weapons, and use of  defensive systems--and second-class nuclear powers--which do not  possess such capabilities.    France and Great Britain may organize closer cooperation  even  without the United States in developing a new generation of  offensive and defensive systems. Certain allies of the United  States are already attempting to lessen their data and  information dependence on the Pentagon. In particular, France is  focusing attention on improving and perfecting its information  and intelligence service by developing its own space-based means  of observation and by creating new intelligence organs,  processing and analysis centers, and data and information  distribution centers.    Evolution of the strategic nuclear balance in the direction  of "regionalization" could accelerate European military  integration and gradually destroy the Atlantic partnership. It  should be noted that up until now the Europeans have not gotten  very much out of cooperation with the United States in the  sphere of SDI-related technologies, although their support for  this program permitted the Americans to obtain decent political  dividends during the period of the Cold War with the USSR.    Another question that will have an effect on formation of  the  infrastructure for cooperation between the United States,  Russia, and other powers in the sphere of control and  nonproliferation consists in whether or not nuclear weapons will  be used directly or indirectly in possible conflicts between the  North and the South, concerning which much is now being said.  Will it be at all possible to depend on nuclear weapons to  contain regional conflicts, especially without using them a  single time for appearance sake, as was done by the United  States in Hiroshima and Nagasaki?    Unless the North withdraws from participation in conflicts  of  the chronically unstable South, nuclear weapons may become an  important factor in North-South mutual relations, other  effective means and methods of exerting influence being lacking.  For Russia this unfavorable prospect may acquire special  significance, insofar as it borders directly on the most  explosive regions of Asia.    The build-up of tension in relations with the Third World  contributes towards accelerating the regional arms race in the  South. The industrially developed countries of the North may try  to use against the South the same strategy that was used by the  West against the USSR during the Cold War period: a nuclear  threat to prevent the possible employment of conventional or  nuclear weapons. It is not ruled out that under these conditions  Russia will privately be viewed by them as an outpost, similar  to the way Germany was a foothold of NATO in the confrontation  with the East. True, the given scenario is not very probable  since it does not conform to the interests of Russia, which must  not permit the victors in the Cold War to use it as a battering  ram or cannon fodder in their policies with respect to countries  of the South. However, deliberate and selective arousal of the  "Islamic factor" with the help of the American intelligence  community may put Russian diplomacy in a quandary when it is  forced either to resort to brute force for assistance or to give  up its positions--as is now the case in Tajikistan. In any  event, the Islamic card plays a role of no small significance  in--as was stated in the latest U.S. Department of Defense  report--"not permitting the emergence of a new global threat to  the United States, similar to the Soviet threat." (Footnote 5)  (Ibid., p. 3, 4.)    This can hardly be expected to strengthen the foundations of  cooperation between Russia and the United States in control and  nonproliferation.</p>

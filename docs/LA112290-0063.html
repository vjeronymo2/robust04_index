			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL URGES THAT HALF OF APPOINTEES BE  WOMEN  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council unanimously approved a motion Wednesday urging  that at least half of the mayor's appointees to city boards and commissions be  women.  </P> <P> Bill Chandler, a spokesman for Mayor Tom Bradley, said the mayor has "already  made a very strong commitment to increase the number of women on commissions."  </P> <P> He said that last summer, when Bradley appointed more than 30 commissioners, a  majority were women.  </P> <P> The motion was introduced by City Councilwoman Gloria Molina, who cited a 70%  male to 30% female disparity in appointments to the policy-making boards.  </P> <P> "If our democratic institutions are to be truly representative, we must achieve  balance and parity with the general population," Molina said. "At least 50% of  our population is female. That should be reflected on our boards and  commissions."  </P></p>

"We hope that this is a space which we can fill with our  activities. We hope that these activities will be carried out  by us as well as the sixteen NATO countries and will soon result  in our becoming part of NATO, which associates countries with  which we are linked in terms of human development, history and  values," Zieleniec said.    Olechowski described the partnership initiative as a very  significant contribution to European security and a constructive  and optimistic programme. But, he said, he saw a problem in the  programme's not suggesting clear prospects of NATO membership  for the Visegrad Group countries -- the Czech Republic,  Slovakia, Hungary and Poland.    "Unfortunately, we see that we must go through different  preparatory stages in order to join all the Western institutions  we want to, without a promise that we will eventually succeed.  This is a critical point of the Polish standpoint," Olechowski  said.</p>

Speaking at a national meeting on comprehensive agricultural  development, State Councillor Chen Junsheng said China will  continue to increase the output of grain, cotton and other farm  produce and more investment will be used for their development.    Chen, who is in charge of China's agriculture, said that  priority will be given to production of grain, cotton, edible  oil and meat, transformation of grassland and development of  large areas of wasteland.    People in the central and western parts of China, which  accounted for about 60 percent of the total investment during  the five years, will be given more money for comprehensive  agricultural development, he added.    He said that nearly 20 billion yuan investment in  comprehensive agricultural projects during 1988-1992 had helped  China produce more grain, cotton, edible oil, sugar and meat.    The official said that a total of about seven million ha  [hectares] of low-yield and medium-yield farmland had been  transformed during the five years and about one million ha of  wasteland suitable for farming have been developed.    In addition, about one million ha of land have been  afforested and 300,000 ha of grassland improved.    Thanks to the development, China has produced an additional  17 million tons of grain, 250,000 tons of cotton, 700,000 tons  of edible oil, nearly 10,000 tons of sugar and 620,000 tons of  meat.    Priority of the project has been given to five provinces in  the valleys of the Yellow River, Huaihe River and Haihe River,  including the provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Anhui, Henan,  Jiangsu, plains in northwest China and some areas in south and  central China.    "There are about 66 million ha of low-yield and medium-yield  farmland to be transformed," the official said. He added that  the land already transformed made up only one tenth of the total.    He said the productivity of 80 percent of China's 400  million  ha of grassland will be doubled if it is transformed.    Grain produced by transformed farmland in east China's Anhui  Province accounted for about 60 percent of Anhui's total and in  coastal Shandong Province and north China's Hebei Province, 33  percent of their grain came from transformed land.    Liaoning Province, which is known as a large industrial  province in China and had to buy 1.5 million tons of grain from  other parts of the country, has since 1991 become self-efficient  in grain, eggs, milk, meat and some other farm produce, after a  five-year-long comprehensive agricultural development.</p>

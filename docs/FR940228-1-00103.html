			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary believes that some institutions have assessed excessive equipment charges that have increased the total aid received. For example, some students have been charged as much as ten or fifteen times an institution's documented equipment costs for kits students were required to purchase. If the calculation of a refund includes equipment charges with such an extreme price mark-up, the amount of money an institution would be permitted to keep is greatly inflated. To help curb this abuse, the Secretary is proposing to require an institution to publish in its school catalog or other information provided to its students, the cost to the student of required supplies and equipment. Further, the Secretary proposes to require an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution to substantiate to Department officials, upon the request of the Secretary, that the costs are reasonably related to the costs of providing the supplies and equipment to students. This provision would not require the institution to provide this cost substantiation to students, but would permit the Secretary to obtain information regarding the cost of required supplies and equipment to determine whether an abuse in this area is occurring or has occurred. For example, this information may be routinely reviewed during a program review. If the charges for equipment and supplies appear to be unreasonable, the institution would be required to show that its charges were reasonably related to the cost of providing those items. Under this proposal, an institution would not be expected to provide this information to the Secretary as a regularly scheduled submission, but only upon request from the Department of Education.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Fair and Equitable Refund Policy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 484B of the HEA defines a fair and equitable refund policy to be one that provides for at least the largest of the amounts provided under:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The requirements of applicable State law;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The specific refund requirements established by the institution's nationally recognized accrediting agency and approved by the Secretary; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  refund calculation described in the statute for students attending the institution for the first time, except that this  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  refund calculation does not apply for any student whose withdrawal date is after the 60 percent point in time in the period of enrollment for which the student has been charged.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary intends to clarify that an accrediting agency's refund policy must contain specific standards. Refund ``guidelines'' developed by an accrediting agency (for example, an accrediting agency refund policy that only requires an institution to develop its own fair and equitable refund policy)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would not be considered to have standards. Obviously, an institution would not be considered to be in compliance with a State's or an approved accrediting agency's refund policy if the institution adopts a refund policy that is merely similar to the State's or accrediting agency's but does not incorporate all the required standards. This policy is consistent with the current provisions of the FFEL program regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary recognizes that there may be situations where an institution's State and accrediting agency do not have specific refund policies. If a student is not entitled to a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  refund, no specific standard would then exist under the law to ensure that the student received a fair and equitable refund. Because the Secretary believes that all recipients of Title IV, HEA program assistance should be treated fairly, the Secretary is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposing to require an institution to provide a refund to a student that is the larger of the institution's refund policy or the specific refund standards contained in appendix A to this part if an institution's State and accrediting agency do not have refund standards and the student is not entitled to a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  refund. The NPRM published on January 24, 1994 to implement the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accrediting agency provisions in subpart 2 of part H of the HEA proposes that the Secretary will not recognize an accrediting agency unless the agency has a refund policy that provides for a fair and equitable refund to a student. The Secretary notes that if this provision of the accreditation agency NPRM is adopted in final regulations, there would not be a need for the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appendix A requirement once all accrediting agencies have been reviewed and recognized by the Secretary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

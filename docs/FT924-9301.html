			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / New US tax legislation Attempts by the US to introduce new tax legislation affecting foreign corporations could lead to tit-for-tat retaliation from other countries. An obvious candidate in the UK would be for the Inland Revenue to withhold the refund to US-owned companies on advance corporation tax (ACT) levied on the dividends paid to shareholders. A precedent for retaliation does exist. Legislation was introduced in 1985 in the UK in response to unitary tax laws in California and can be triggered at any time if a current appeal on its applicability to UK companies is lost. However, the Revenue sees no way that this could be used in response to Mr Clinton's proposals.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Macao, June 9 (XINHUA) -- China and Portugal  continued here today their discussions on the involvement of the  Bank of China (BOC) in note-issuing matters in Macao.    Representatives and monetary experts from both sides agreed  that BOC and Portugal-funded Banco Nacional Ultramarino E.P.,  now the note-issuing bank in Macao, could issue notes in Macao  at a certain ratio. Concrete measures will be discussed at  later meetings of the working group.    Han Zhaokang, representative from the Chinese team of the  Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group, said after the fourth  meeting here today that talks on the note-issuing would soon  enter the essential stage. He added, the Chinese Government  hopes that matters concerning note-issuing should be handled in  the light of the regulations in the Sino-Portuguese Joint  Declaration and in the convergence with the Macao Basic Law.    Han Zhaokang said he was convinced that when the work on  note-issuing ends, "it will be a good thing for the maintenance  of stability of Macao's monetary system."</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Seoul vernacular newspapers on 17 March  react to the seventh South-North working-level contact to  exchange special envoys which was held at Panmunjom yesterday.    The moderate TONG-A ILBO, the conservative CHOSON ILBO, the  moderate HANGUK ILBO, and the moderate CHUNGANG ILBO all carry  800-word editorials on page 3, pointing out that the North  side's insincere attitude resulted in the lack of results in the  16 March inter-Korean contact. The CHOSON ILBO editorial, in  particular, urges the government to come up with a new long-term  policy on North Korea, noting that "we have lost the initiative  in talks because our North Korean policy has no basis or  principle."    CHOSON ILBO also carries a 900-word article by reporter An  Hui-chang on page 3 which cites the analysis of observers that  "North Korea's strategy is to link the issue of allowing  additional inspections with the issue of holding the third-round  North Korean-U.S. talks, because it believes that assuming a  rigid attitude and utilizing the inspections by the  International Atomic Energy Agency as an ace card will result in  the United States again acceding to negotiations." Meanwhile, a  1,200 word article by Ku Pon-yong on page 4 in the  pro-government SEOUL SINMUN attributes North Korea's "inactive  attitude" on the envoy exchange to its concern that this will  lead to a rapid improvement in South-North relations, which may  then lead to popular unrest in North Korea where "systemic  crisis caused by serious economic difficulties" exists. This  article also points out that North Korea's insistence on direct  negotiations with the United States aims to effect improved  relations with the United States while gaining economic aid from  it, and also serves to "estrange the ROK from the United States."    Chong Pyong-chin's 1,000-word article in the moderate HANGUK  ILBO predicts that the voices of hardliners in the South Korean  Government will likely increase with the lack of progress in the  last inter-Korean working-level contact. The article says  people are suspicious that "North Korea and the United States  agreed on terms that the public is unaware of before announcing  their agreement on 25 February" and that "the United States is  conversely using the `North Korean card' against the ROK." The  article adds that these reasons were cited by certain sections  of the government in their "insistence" on reviewing ROK-U.S.  relations.    Kang Tae-ho's 1,000-word article in the left-leaning  HANGYORE  SINMUN criticizes both the South and the North for the lack of  progress in their working-level contacts. Remarking on the  South side's "active and offensive" attitude and the North  side's "inactive and defensive" posture in the dialogue, the  article points out the South's "undesirable attitude of  provoking the North by mentioning the third round of North  Korean-U.S. talks." The article anticipates that South and  North Korea will also fail to reach agreement in the next  contact slated for 19 March, and that South and North Korea will  probably enter again into "a phase of harsh confrontation" so  that talk of the "uselessness of dialogue" abounds in South  Korea, North Korea, and the United States.    Reporter An Song-ki of the CHUNGANG ILBO simply argues in a  900-word article on page 5 that North Korea is insisting on the  announcement of a joint South-North communique because it  intends to "shift the responsibility to South Korea and the  United States if the third round of North Korean-U.S. talks  fail."</p>

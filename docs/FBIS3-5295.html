			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Economic policy speech by Manae Kubota, director general of </F> the Economic Planning Agency, to the 129th ordinary Diet session  -- live]    [Excerpts] I would like to deliver a speech on urgent  tasks facing Japan's economy and basic views of economic  management. Amid the unprecedented, prolonged economic slump  caused by the bubble economy, Japan is being required to review  the consumer-oriented economic and social structures which have  so far supported our country. This means switching the basic  idea of our economic society. Japan is being urged to change  the current economic society into one which attaches importance  to people and consumers. We have to accelerate significantly our  efforts to reform the structure of our economic society in line  with the trend of this new era.    On the international front, Japan, which is responsible for  16 percent of the world's GNP, is required to fulfill an active  role commensurate to its economic power. In other words, Japan  needs to make positive efforts to voluntarily tackle the task of  building a new world economic order. On the domestic front,  Japan needs to promote transparency of its economic society and  try to build a society in harmony with the international  community. [passage omitted on a people-oriented economic  society]    Moreover, such an economic society will be realized through  changing our society. The path for realizing a people-oriented  society may be not easy. [passage omitted on need for the  government to tackle this issue]    This year we must ensure a smooth and full-fledged recovery  of the economy, and mark the first year of successfully changing  the economic society. [passage omitted on the world economic  situation]    Meanwhile, the success of GATT's Uruguay Round talks brings  a  bright prospect for the future of the world economy. Generally,  Japan's economy is in a slump, marked by a continuing slump in  personal consumption and a decrease in the private sector's  plant and equipment investment. The severity of employment  conditions is noted especially in the manufacturing industry.  [passage omitted on review of the series of economic  pump-priming measures the government introduced in September  last year and February this year]    Thanks to the effects of the economic measures, the  foundation for economic recovery is now being created. However,  the real growth rate of gross domestic product (GDP) in fiscal  1993 is expected to be about 0.2 percent, without a full-fledged  recovery in private demand.    While keeping those conditions in mind, we would like to  adopt the following basic points to tackle economic management  for fiscal 1994. The first point is to put Japan's economy  on-track for a full-fledged recovery as soon as possible so that  sustainable growth in the years following fiscal 1994 will be  ensured. To this end, we will implement maximum policies by the  end of fiscal 1994. To continuously stimulate the economy this  spring, which starts the new fiscal year, we soon plan to  implement the economic pump-priming package. For example, we  will make efforts for the smooth implementation of public works  projects which were added in the third supplementary budget for  fiscal 1993. [passage omitted reviewing the draft budget for  fiscal 1994 and tax cuts] On monetary policy, I think  appropriate and flexible management is necessary in the future  while closely watching domestic and international economic  movements and international currency conditions. [passage  omitted on efforts to improve employment conditions and the need  for stability of prices] With economic management by the  government and positive efforts by the private sector in support  of economic activities for voluntary recovery, Japan's economy  is expected to be on-track for a full-fledged economic recovery  during fiscal 1994. The GDP's real growth rate is expected to  reach about 2.4 percent in the fiscal year.    The second point is that to bring about a creative and  energetic economic society, conditions for future economic  development should be created through such measures as steady  implementation of structural reform. [passage omitted on need  for efforts to create such conditions] Moreover, we plan to  help companies in restructuring their business by promoting  creative research programs and improving conditions to prepare  for a highly developed information-oriented society. We would  like to promote development of new business and creative  business activities. [passage omitted on efforts to improve  working conditions]    In connection with the tax system reform, we are expected  to create a fair and vital society taking into account the rapid  increase of the aged population. We intend to continue our  study to create a tax system which gives adequate consideration  for the balance among the people's income, consumption, and  assets in line with the advisory report of the Tax System  Council. In that area, we will try our best to carry out tax  system reform within this year. [passage omitted on  environment-friendly economy]    Third, we intend to shift the focus of economic policies  onto  consumers. This is to enrich individuals' lifestyle by setting  the goal of the Japanese economy in fields directly related to  qualitative improvement of the public livelihood. In connection  with this the fiscal 1994 budget plan lays emphasis on public  work projects for housing, sewerage, and garbage disposal  facilities. The government intends to maintain the preferential  budget allotment in fields related to the public livelihood.  [passage omitted on details of above-mentioned construction,  housing programs]    The disparity of commodity prices between the Japanese and  international markets is one of the major reasons the public  cannot actually feel their economic achievements. To ease the  problem, we will correct and cut such causes as government  regulations and exclusionary business practices. [passage  omitted on women's social positions]    Regarding the product liability system and other measures  for  preventing and redressing economic damage to consumers, we would  like to enact necessary legislation as soon as possible. In  accord with advisory reports of the Social Policy Council, some  bills may be submitted to the current Diet session.    Fourth, we would like to positively create harmonic foreign  economic relations, contribute to revitalization of the world  economy, and take the initiative in maintaining and reinforcing  the free trade system. To achieve this objective, we should  positively promote structural reform of the economy through  deregulation so that both Japanese and foreign-national  companies and individuals can participate in business activities  under visible rules. Functions of the OTO [Office of Trade and  Investment Ombudsman] have been recently strengthened. OTO  activities and review of government procurement procedures will  further improve the accessibility of foreign companies to the  Japanese market. Also, we will promote imports and direct  investments from foreign companies. With Japan's market opening  efforts and economic recovery, its trade surplus in fiscal 1994  is expected to become lower than the previous year.    The virtual conclusion of the Uruguay Round indicates the  strong resolve of GATT member nations to maintain and strengthen  the multilateral free trade system. Japan will steadily  implement achievements in the GATT negotiations.    To ensure stability and steady growth of developing nations,  we would like to enrich our economic assistance programs in line  with the Official Development Assistance [ODA] guidelines and  the fifth ODA mid-term plan. Also, we will offer appropriate  intellectual assistance, such as technological assistance to  smoothly implement the economic reform efforts of former  planned-economy nations.    The above is my view of Japan's major economic issues and  the  favorable direction of economic policies. In the last seven  years of the 20th Century, the international economy is expected  to grow beyond current boundaries. The world economy is  probably heading for a new order of the market economy system  through such new trends as the rise of bloc economies and  economic reform of former planned- economy nations. In the  process, the Asian economy is expected to grow bigger, and Japan  will not be able to remain unaffected by the drastic changes in  the structure of the world economy. I believe our duty is to  overcome such changes appropriately, and realize the bright  future of the Japanese economy in the 21st Century. We do have  accumulated economic power, highly-educated personnel resources,  and a high level of technological and cultural foundations. We  are now expected to demonstrate our creativity and ability to  make the most of our resources in the new era. Change is a way  to utilize the people's efforts for the future. I would like to  try to achieve the best based on the people's choice and action.  I sincerely hope for their support and cooperation.</p>

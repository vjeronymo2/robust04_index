			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's  alternate special representative in Cyprus, said that the views  of the two sides are identical on some of the seven key points  of the proximity talks agenda on the confidence-building  measures [CBM's]. In a statement made tonight after meeting  President Glavkos Kliridhis, Feissel added that other points  must be further clarified. He said he was satisfied that the  procedure is progressing well. Feissel added: But, if the two  sides do not go all the way, what has been achieved so far  essentially means nothing.    Feissel said that with the conclusion of this week's talks,  which focused on the UN notes, the positions of the two sides  were determined to a large degree. He said that these positions  will form the basis of next week's talks. He also said that he  is convinced that if both sides work toward this goal, an  agreement on the CBM's can be reached this month.    Asked what has been the benefit of the talks so far, Feissel  said that the form and ways to implement the CBM's on the legal  regime of UN control of Famagusta and the benefit to the two  sides from the opening of the fenced-off area and Nicosia  Airport has been clarified. He added that Joe Clark, the UN  secretary general's special representative in Cyprus, is  arriving at a very good time for the talks and aims to help the  negotiating procedure.    Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said the Greek  Cypriot side does not yet have a complete picture of the Turkish  Cypriot positions. He said the Greek Cypriot side presented its  positions on Feissel's notes this week. He added that the  United Nations aims to bring the two sides closer to an  agreement and stressed that the Greek Cypriot side does not  reject Feissel's notes on the headlines of the talks agenda.    The spokesman concluded that a new round of talks, which  will  be more intense than the talks held so far, will be held next  week with Clark's participation.</p>

			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Oftel lifts curbs on Cellnet Oftel, the telecommunications regulator, has revoked restrictions on Cellnet, the mobile phone network joint venture between British Telecommunications and Securicor, pre-venting it from cross-subsidising its service-provision business. Mr Don Cruickshank, the director-general of Oftel, said that the restrictions were 'no longer necessary' because of action taken by Cellnet. Mr Cruickshank said, however, that he intended to continue monitoring mobile phone network companies to ensure they provided no 'unfair cross-subsidy' to their service provision subsidiaries, which would adversely affect independent service providers.</p>

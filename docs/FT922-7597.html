			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Golden triangle hits note of northern confidence THE SUPER-RICH, inhabiting a little-known golden triangle of rural England, are helping to alter the traditional image of the down-at-heel north. Just six months after opening an office in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, 'accountants-to-the-rich' firm of Saffery Champness, is earning fees of Pounds 1m a year, recruiting extra staff and taking on more office space. And this at a time when accountants nationally have been cutting back and axing staff in the face of the recession. North Yorkshire's 'golden triangle', which straddles the A1 Great North Road between York, Wetherby and Harrogate, boasts more super-rich (minimum qualifications Pounds 20m of net worth) than any other part of the country outside Belgravia and Mayfair in London. The county has always had rich landowners but now it has become a desirable place to live for rich entrepreneurs like Mr Tony Clegg, former chief of the Mountleigh group. He lives at Whixley, midway between Harrogate and York. The triangle's wider fame is that Marston Moor is in its middle. It was here in 1644 that Cromwell's Ironsides defeated the dashing Prince Rupert's cavalry, giving parliament control of the north. In modern times, the rich have been waging a different kind of war against parliament, saving as much as they can of their wealth from the taxman and their children's inheritance from the state. Saffery has been acting as a specialist soldier-for-hire in this field since 1855, but has only just deemed the north of England worthy of having its own office. Mr Keith Weston, a Saffery Champness partner who has now totally forsaken London for the north, said his whole year's budget for new business had already been beaten by 100 per cent as a result. He now sees Yorkshire's golden triangle as far too limited. Still pinching himself with disbelief that this really is the down-trodden north of London mythology, he has drawn a new one, with Newcastle, Liverpool and Grimsby at the corners. This takes in the rich pastures of Cheshire and the Derbyshire Peaks, as well as the rest of Yorkshire and Humberside. The firm is strong in Scotland, where its Aberdeen and Edinburgh offices claim to act for most of the people who own that country, but has all its other 12 branch offices below a line from the Severn estuary to the Wash, which marks the north-south divide. One of its busiest offices is even further south, in the Channel Islands, Mr Weston has also discovered that Leeds is full of good solicitors, such as Dibb Lupton Broomhead, Hepworth and Chadwick, and Simpson Curtis, offering London standards of service at northern prices ' a discount of up to 50 per cent that will save the rich even more money.</p>

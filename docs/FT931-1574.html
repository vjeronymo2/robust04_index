			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Procedural hurdles loom - As the bill to ratify the Maastricht treaty returns to the House of Commons, FT writers look at the remaining obstacles to its passage THE parliamentary progress of any bill is like a hurdles race: it goes round a clearly marked track with regular obstacles. But ministers' failure to control the progress of the Maastricht bill has turned that race into a more gruelling assault course on which the government will finish, but risks injury in doing so. The government's inability to win a Commons vote imposing a 'guillotine' to limit all future discussion of the bill is so patent that such a vote has not even been sought. But it is this inability that has exposed it to so many back-bench rebellions and prevents it from setting a date for royal assent. In most other cases the timing of a bill is agreed between the two main parties, which ensure that the issues in which they are most interested receive the greatest airing. Where the parties cannot agree, the government puts forward a motion to timetable discussion and - once it has won that vote - can then be sure that the bill will be through within the allotted time. The problem is worsened because, as a constitutional measure, the line-by-line discussion of the Maastricht bill involves the potential participation of all 600-plus MPs, and excludes other business in the Commons itself. In almost every other case, after a full day's debate to give it a second reading, the bill in effect disappears from view to be considered in detail by a cross-party committee of some 20 to 30 MPs. Some weeks later it re-emerges into the public gaze for edited highlights to be replayed at the report stage, in which they are debated by the whole House. Before giving final approval, the Commons holds a third-reading debate, sometimes for no more than a matter of minutes. For Maastricht, this is likely instead to be a set-piece confrontation between government and rebels. When the bill goes to the Lords, however, ministers can relax a bit more. By convention peers never vote against a bill's second reading, and the committee and report stages are almost indistinguishable. Both stages take place as the main business of the day, and the bill can be altered at any point. Minor amendments can even be made as the legislation is given a third reading. Lords debates attract less attention, and the government need not be embarrassed at being unable to control the timing: no guillotine ever cuts off Lords' debates. 4The only drawback is that any changes made by the Lords, no matter how minor or arcane, have to be approved by MPs as well. In many cases the return of the bill to the Commons is purely a technical stage. On Maastricht, however, it could lead to a further, opaque discussion on matters which would not be known until perhaps only days before. So far as the UK's EC partners are concerned, that might be a fitting end to the unenviable assault course that has been Westminster's consideration of Maastricht.</p>

			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Daimler-Benz There is clearly plenty of pain to go round at Daimler-Benz. Mr Edzard Reuter, the company's chief executive, admitted as much when he said that shareholders as well as staff would have to suffer the pangs of restructuring. At one level that hint of a dividend cut might be viewed as a realisation of the depth of Daimler's difficulties. Yet the reasons for Mr Reuter's statement are perhaps themselves a concern. If his purpose was to soothe opposition from the workforce, then he may not have yet persuaded the staff that radical surgery is needed. Having allowed costs to drift for too long, Daimler can hardly afford protracted internal debate or lengthy industrial action. Most of Daimler's markets remain depressed. Airline losses may be slowing, but new aircraft production is still being cut - particularly at Airbus - and defence spending continues to fall. AEG consumer goods business is wilting and its ICE train is losing out to the French TGV in export markets. Daimler-Benz cars are too expensive to produce compared to the competition. All of Daimler's operations suffer from the strength of the D-mark. Besides, the company is hardly alone in its effort to cut costs. Its Japanese competitors face equally hard markets and are busy retrenching too. The risk is that most of the efficiency gains will be ceded to customers in lower prices. Even if the plan works and the company can get back to peak earnings of around DM 70 a share by 1996-97, the shares hardly look cheap. That, and a lower payout, should give investors pause for thought if the rights issue hat is passed round next year.</p>

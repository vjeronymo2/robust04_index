			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Management (The Growing Business): How to find a PC when you want one - Paul Taylor cuts through the jargon and offers advice on buying a personal computer It is more than a decade since the first IBM PCs appeared on desktops, but according to recent surveys, many businessmen and women are still uncomfortable with PC technology. Help is usually at hand in a large organisation, either from the whiz-kids in the information department - assuming they can be torn away from the latest technical journal - or from less intimidated colleagues. But the small business computer user, or potential user, must seek other solutions. The first issues to confront the uninitiated are often the basic questions - do I need a computer and what can it do for me? Most computer advertisers and salesmen would like potential customers to believe that life without a PC is barely worth living and that a PC on the end of a desk can do just about everything. In reality many basic office functions, such as keeping a diary or simple bookkeeping, are more easily and efficiently achieved with paper, pen and calculator. Basic data, like sales figures or customer addresses, do not miraculously appear in a computer's electronic brain. They have to be put there, usually via the keyboard. What computers, or rather the software programs that run on them, are particularly good at, is organising and manipulating information, and performing complex or repetitive tasks or calculations. Examples include combining a mailing list of customers compiled on a database program and a letter written on a word-processing program to send out details of a special offer. They are also good at examining what happens to profits if suppliers increase prices; or calculating tax, national insurance contributions and pay for employees each week, using a spreadsheet programme. By far the most common use of PCs is for accounting. A recent survey found that more than half the small companies with a computer had bought it for this purpose. The other main use is as a word-processor, although this may mean that the machine ends up being little more than a glorified typewriter. But if you still think you need a computer, the next question is which one? A quick glance through any of the dozen-plus computer magazines on sale in local newsagents is enough to deter all but the most determined. Similarly a visit to a High Street electrical shop will probably only confuse - most of the machines likely to be on display are underpowered and overpriced - and the shop assistant is most unlikely to be of any help. There are, however, other ways to go about buying a computer. Specialist computer stores are sometimes willing to provide advice, unless they are of the pile-them-high-sell-them-fast variety. However, many potential customers also find computer stores intimidating - after all, who wants to show off their ignorance to a youth half their age? For those with lots of money to spend, there are computer consultants who will advise on purchase, find and set up the equipment, load the software and teach the customer how to use the new toy. But such advice does not come cheap. A morning's training on a new accounting package, for example, can cost several hundred pounds. The only real alternative is often self-help, which need not be terrifying. In many of the computer magazines there are sections designed specifically for the novice. For example, What Micro magazine has a section called 'How to buy' while Computer Shopper has a buyer's glossary and a section dealing with buying equipment each month. This has also been put together in a useful Pounds 2.95 book called PC Buying Questions. Other books for learners include the PC Novice's Handbook - which includes jargon-busting sections on hardware and software and a chapter on shopping - the PC Crash Course and Survival Guide, and What to do when a MICRO lands on your desk. The standard advice on buying a computer used to be to decide on the software first. This is less important these days because the IBM-compatible standard is nearly all-pervasive - the honourable exception being the user-friendly Apple Macintosh computer family. Most PC's have become interchangeable machines which will run most of the serious business software - and the growing number of PC games too. However it is important to remember that the new software packages require some pretty heavy duty hardware. Thus a basic business machine today would be an IBM-compatible based on Intel's 80386 processor chip with at least 2-Megabytes of Ram (random access memory), a 40Mb hard disk, a VGA colour screen, mouse pointing device and Windows, Microsoft's hugely successful operating environment which has sold 9m copies worldwide. Such a machine has more power than most traditional mainframe computers. But fortunately computer prices are continuing to tumble. For example, Dell which pioneered direct sales in the UK, sells its 325P machine with colour monitor and a 50Mb hard disk for Pounds 1,149 (excluding VAT). These days the direct sales channel is well established and most direct sale computer manufactures provide an on-site maintenance contract for a reasonable fee and lifetime telephone support - for all those problems, large and small, that the manual does not answer.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] PNP [Peruvian National Police] intelligence sources  disclosed that Wilber Alvarado Linares, aka Champa, one of the  main drug dealers in the Upper Huallaga, allegedly has taken the  place of Demetrio Limoniel Chavez Penaherrera, aka Vaticano, as  the main drug supplier for the Cali cartel.    Moreover, the Rodriguez Orejuela brothers, barons of the  cartel, allegedly have chosen to contact Champa to try to  recover the advance they paid Vaticano to buy white cocaine  paste.    According to our sources, the arrest of Vaticano in Cali,  Colombia, will represent a hard blow to the Rodriguez Orejuelas'  "economy" if they fail to identify the "buyers" who received an  advance for the purchase of a "large quantity" of drugs.    Other traffickers such as "Camboya," "Escorpio," "Santena,"  "Joselito," "Chuquin," "Mecano," "Tico," "Nano," etc., who also  have "interests" in the Upper Huallaga might also be affected  for having given Vaticano an advance of several thousands of  dollars.    In this regard, it was learned that Elias Chavez  Penaherrera,  aka Lan, who is Vaticano's brother and the pilot of his private  aircraft, may take Vaticano's place because he knows his  "contacts" and probably the drug buyers who received the advance  payment from the Cali cartel.    Moreover, the National Intelligence Service has discovered  that Vaticano and the aforementioned drug traffickers had their  operations center in the Upper Huallaga, Palma Pampa, Ramal de  Aspuzana, Huicungo, "Boca de Diablo," Bellavista, and Bolognesi  Province.    As for Demetrio Limoniel Chavez Penaherrera, it was learned  that the Intelligence Services as well as Dinandro [Antidrug  Division] are after several of his front men whose names are  being kept secret and other people also involved in drug  trafficking.</p>

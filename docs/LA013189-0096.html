			<p><P> January 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FCC DELAYS DECISION ON AT&amp;T PRICE PLAN  </P> <P> Federal Communications Commission Chairman Dennis R. Patrick, acknowledging  concerns on Capitol Hill about a proposal to revamp the way AT&amp;T sets its  prices for interstate services, on Monday postponed a decision on the plan  until March.  </P> <P> A decision by the FCC on a so-called rate cap method of pricing for American  Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s long-distance services had been scheduled for  Monday. But after members of Congress said the FCC may not have legal authority  to make such a change, Patrick issued a statment before the meeting saying that  he would defer a vote until March to give lawmakers more time to study the  plan.  </P> <P> "Given the importance of this docket, the complexity of the docket and in order  to accommodate the interest in some additional briefings and the provision of  some additional briefing information, I have agreed to reschedule this item for  the meeting on March 16," Patrick said at Monday's hearing.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Acted Wisely'  </P> <P> "I believe it is very important for the commission to draft regulations which  will improve the incentives that are facing dominant carriers," Patrick said.  "On the other hand, the Congress is intensely interested in this docket. . . .  I would hope that in the spirit of the new Administration that we can use this  as a foundation to establish a more constructive dialogue with members on both  sides of the aisle with respect to this matter and other matters that are  pending before the commission."  </P> <P> Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce  Committee, which oversees telecommunications matters, welcomed Patrick's  decision to delay.  </P> <P> "I think the commission acted wisely," Dingell, who had criticized the FCC  proposal, said in a statement. "The Congress had a number of concerns about the  impact of the price caps proposal, and the FCC appears to be addressing them.  As the details of the plan receive public scrutiny and go through the  congressional hearing process, I hope the spirit of cooperation with Congress  will continue."  </P> <P> Since the early 1960s, the government has allowed AT&amp;T a certain profit  beyond its costs. But the FCC proposed replacing this so-called rate-of-return  regulation for "dominant carriers" such as AT&amp;T with ceilings on prices.  That would include the seven regional Bell companies that AT&amp;T spun off in  1984.  </P> <P> The commission said its proposal would encourage greater efficiency and  innovation and save customers $1.6 billion over four years if all the dominant  companies participated. The FCC last May proposed that AT&amp;T be allowed to  raise rates 3% less than annual inflation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Skeptical Lawmakers  </P> <P> AT&amp;T said in a statement that it was "disappointed and frustrated" by  Patrick's deferral and that every day a decision was delayed, "the public  loses."  </P> <P> BellSouth, one of the seven regional phone companies that would be affected by  the new pricing scheme, said, "The commission appears to have stepped away from  an opportunity to save telephone users billions of dollars."  </P> <P> Another regional company, Bell Atlantic, said, "We are sorely disappointed that  the FCC and Congress have been unable to resolve their differences over how to  best implement a price cap plan that will benefit consumers, the  telecommunications industry and the nation."  </P> <P> Lawmakers had been skeptical of the new plan.  </P></p>

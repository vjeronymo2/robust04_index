Our correspondent Gulsafa Ahmedova reports:    [Ahmedova] Deputy Chairman of the Supreme Soviet Afiaddin  Dzhalilov chaired the National Assembly session.    Though the bill on martial law was endorsed [as the basis  for  further debate] at its first reading at one of the previous  session of the National Assembly, in view of proposals that have  been made, it was recommitted to the relevant commission for  amendments.    Metleb Mutallimov, chairman of the commission, submitted the  new version of the bill to the parliamentarians. A new debate  began. Its importance for the republic that is living under war  conditions was noted.    Tofik Gasymov, chairman of the commission that drafted the  bill on border guards, briefed the National Assembly about the  bill. The parliamentarians put forward a number of interesting  proposals during the debate. The bill was then put to a vote  paragraph by paragraph. It was adopted on the condition that  some editorial changes be made to it.    The parliamentarians then expressed their agreement with the  removal of the Deputy Prime Minister Vakhid Akhmedov and Finance  Minister Salekh Mamedov from their posts.    The bill on the legislative plan for the first quarter of  1994 was debated and adopted in full after certain proposals  were taken into account.    The National Assembly was continuing its session when our  newscast went on the air.</p>

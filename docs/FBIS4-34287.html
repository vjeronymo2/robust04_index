			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed interview with Vice President Gonzalo Aguirre </F> "in the past few hours"--place not given]    [Excerpts] [EL PAIS] How will you conduct your electoral  campaign?    [Aguirre] It will be based on a platform with clear and  specific proposals to resolve the problems the country will face  in 1995. We will not resort to personal attacks that are  unworthy of the entire political system and especially of those  who resort to this ignoble method. We also will not resort to  deriding the ideas of our political opponents merely because we  do not share all or some of their ideas. We will not even engage  in unfavorably judging the national or departmental  administration of other parties. It is not by monitoring the  past or denying the success of former administrations--including  our party's administration--that we will instill faith and  optimism in the citizens.    [EL PAIS] What would be your first step if you were elected  president of the Republic?    [Aguirre] I would call on the leaders of all parties,  beginning with those of our own party, to form a coalition  government and, if possible, a government of national unity.    [EL PAIS] What do you understand is a coalition government?    [Aguirre] It is a government formed by various parties that  jointly establish the basic guidelines for the policies to be  implemented, share their responsibilities, and support it, by a  majority, in Congress. There is no such coalition government  when these basic guidelines are exclusively established by the  president of the Republic and his closest aides. There is no  coalition government either when the president merely appoints  citizens from other parties for both ministerial or autonomous  agency posts. [passage omitted]    [EL PAIS] Do you agree with the current government's  economic  policy? If you were elected president, would you continue  implementing the same policy?    [Aguirre] I agree with its basic guidelines, which are the  following: the opening of the economy, regional economic  integration, curbing inflation, and reducing the fiscal deficit.  I do not share, however, a dogmatic implementation of this  policy because I believe dogmatism is bad in all walks of life.    Therefore, if I were elected president, I would continue  implementing these four basic guidelines, but with the  flexibility required to adjust them to dynamic and changing  realities. At any rate, I do not hope to conduct a government  that will be a repetition of the current one.    [EL PAIS] In your opinion, what are the principal problems  the next government will have to face?    [Aguirre] There are various problems like achieving  conditions that will allow our producers and entrepreneurs to  successfully compete within the framework of economic  integration with our neighbors; implementing an effective  decentralization, which will not be achieved by forming new  organizations in Montevideo but by promoting new entrepreneurial  projects harmoniously distributed throughout our national  territory; reforming or updating our education system, adjusting  it for our young people's required integration into the labor  market; reforming social security, which in no way will violate  the rights of existing retirees; defining the state's role and  its reform so as to reduce the burden on productive activities;  and--without finishing the list of issues to be  resolved--implementing an agricultural, livestock, and  industrial policy that will favor growth in our country's entire  productive sector and create new and effective job openings.  [passage omitted]    [EL PAIS] Will the constitutional reform be approved? Why  are  you supporting it?    [Aguirre] No doubt it will be approved. Obviously, most  citizens agree with this reform. They especially support the  so-called "multiparty voting" system. This is an unequivocal  wish in the interior of our country. And a recent poll already  indicates the resolute support of 66 percent of the voters.    As everyone knows, I am supporting this reform with profound  conviction because I believe in free voting. For obvious  reasons, it does not make any sense for a person who votes for a  given party's presidential candidate to not be allowed to vote,  if this is the person's idea, for another party's mayoral  candidate.

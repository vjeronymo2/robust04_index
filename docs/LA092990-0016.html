			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> FEES MAY BE RAISED FOR PLANNING PERMITS  </P> <P> The Ventura Planning Commission has proposed increasing planning permit fees,  which could cost developers thousands of dollars.  </P> <P> The proposed resolution would allow the city to recover 75% of the cost of  providing a permit or reviewing a development request, Senior Planner Karen  Bates said.  </P> <P> The city's Planning Department does not charge for services such as parking  approval, ordinance amendments or comprehensive plan amendments, which would be  needed to change zoning from industrial to residential, for example, so that a  housing development could be built.  </P> <P> Under the proposed ordinance, an applicant for a comprehensive plan amendment  would pay $2,800 of the $3,722 that officials say it costs the city to process  the permit. Parking approval would cost an applicant $1,000, and an ordinance  amendment would cost $1,600.  </P> <P> A study by the Planning Department shows that the city performs 200 sign  reviews a year for businesses that want to change or add signs. It costs the  city $175, but the applicant pays $20. Although 75% of the cost would be about  $135, Bates said the city has decided that amount might deter business owners  from applying for the review.  </P> <P> "We're having a lot of trouble getting business people to install signs that  meet city codes, and we figure that keeping the fee at $50 will be incentive  for them to get the permit," Bates said.

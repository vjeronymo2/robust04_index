			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, the Department notes that in Arthur D. Little's own ``cash  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flow'' model, long-run sales of appliances are seemingly unaffected by price;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Arthur D. Little has assumed there is no consumer reaction to price, or in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other words, a price elasticity of zero. <FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> This result may be found by examining Appendix C of the ADL report which contains the results of its cash flow model. In it, two cases are discussed: a constant volume case and a variable volume case. The distinction between the two is that in the former, production volume is assumed to be constant for each year, while in the latter, volume is constant for each year until 1997 (two years before standards when, presumably, sales rise in anticipation of higher prices) through 2003. The volume then goes back to the same constant level in 2004. Thus, the results indicate that consumers respond to the coming price increase, but after six years, their demand falls back to the original level, despite the higher price. Thus, aside from a short run effect over a six-year period, the price elasticity of demand is zero. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This assumption would imply that manufacturers were completely free to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> set price at any level they wanted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another area in which the Arthur D. Little report was critical of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model was in the treatment of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dynamic adjustment issues. As Arthur D. Little's report stated, ``To determine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the impact on manufacturers, the Manufacturer Impact Model only examines two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> static cases *&blank;*&blank;* and misses important changes in the health of the industry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> [during the adjustment period].'' (Association of Home Appliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturers,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ``two static cases'' to which Arthur D. Little is referring are the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> base and standards cases. However, Arthur D. Little is incorrect in stating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that these two cases are static. As is documented in the Technical Support  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Document, the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> computes a short-run analysis, the sole purpose of which is to assess the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dynamic impact of standards, in addition to computing the long-run analysis to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine the impacts after those dynamic impacts have been absorbed. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dynamic effect that is captured with the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model short-run analysis is the extra price competition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that may occur when the quantity demanded is suddenly reduced by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards-induced price increase. This dynamic effect generally results in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lower profitability over the short-run, as compared to over the long-run,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> especially at the higher standard levels as reported in Section IV below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This effect is completely ignored by the Arthur D. Little model with its zero  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> price elasticity. However, Arthur D. Little does address a different dynamic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect which the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ignore.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The dynamic effect addressed by Arthur D. Little is the forward time-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shifting of appliance purchases in anticipation of a standards-induced price  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase. The Department has been aware of this for some time, but has not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incorporated it into the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Model because of a lack of data on the extent of purchase time-shifting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, the Department believes that any effect of time-shifting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is initially positive and then negative. When appliances are bought in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advance of standards, the initial effect probably would be to improve profits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and cash flow. When the quantity demanded falls temporarily after standards,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the effect probably would be to hurt profits and cash flow. These two effects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> very nearly should cancel over time. The Department notes that this result is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in sharp contrast to the dynamic effect that the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturer Impact Model does consider, which has a non-recoverable impact on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the industry. Nonetheless, DOE agrees that time-shifting could bear further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investigation and will evaluate whether the estimates supplied by Arthur D.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Little on the magnitude of time-shifting can be of use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

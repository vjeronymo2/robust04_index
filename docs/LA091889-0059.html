			<p><P> September 18, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> E. GERMANY RIDING OUT REFUGEE CRISIS, SHUNS REFORMS  </P> <P> East Germany's Communist regime seems determined to ride out the crisis  provoked by thousands of its citizens seeking refuge in the West and has shown  no sign of initiating reforms that might help keep its citizens from trying to  leave.  </P> <P> And, diplomatic analysts say, this policy may lead to even greater problems in  the future for the country's aging leadership.  </P> <P> "The choice is an almost impossible one for the government," a senior diplomat  here said. "If they don't liberalize the economy and restrictions on personal  life, the people will get more and more frustrated. But if they do, they are  admitting that their hard-line Marxist policies have been wrong."  </P> <P> The dilemma of the East German rulers was posed another way by Karl Kaiser,  director of Bonn's Foreign Policy Institute: "Either they keep the lid on and  sooner or later they get an explosion. Or they try to liberalize and, to a  degree, risk popular movements arising, as happened in Poland and Hungary.  </P> <P> "There is no easy way out, but the second course at least would give the  government a chance by instituting limited reforms."  </P> <P> So far, however, the only reaction of the East German regime has been to launch  a vitriolic barrage against Hungary for letting the refugees cross its frontier  into Austria without travel documents and against West Germany for encouraging  the emigration.  </P> <P> "The language the Communist press is using is remarkable," an observer here  said. "It is almost like Nazi propaganda streaming against West Germany. The  East German regime is even accusing Bonn of reviving Nazism."  </P> <P> One of the reasons for a lack of a coherent response to the flight of the East  Germans -- more than 15,000 have done so illegally so far this year and another  90,000 will legally emigrate to West Germany -- is the silence of Communist  Party chief Erich Honecker, who is 77.  </P> <P> Honecker has been recovering from a reported gallstone operation and has not  appeared in public nor publicly responded to the refugee crisis. None of the  other members of the ruling Politburo have publicly dealt with the issue.  </P> <P> "The regime has been shaken up by so many people leaving," said a Western  diplomat. "It is a rejection of the state created by these old leaders -- of  which they are very proud -- so the question is whether Honecker has even been  informed of the extent of the crisis."  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Free Elections  </P> <P> And the last kind of reform that the East German government is expected to  introduce would be any kind of free elections.  </P> <P> "This government knows what happened when free elections were introduced in  Poland," commented a political specialist. "They know they would be at least as  unpopular with their people as the Polish Communists were in that country."  </P> <P> The East German regime is also losing the limited support it enjoyed from West  Germany's Social Democratic Party, which had held the position that Bonn should  be supportive of the East German leadership in the interest of inner-German  harmony and stability.  </P> <P> "Time is running out," says Social Democratic Party senior member Egon Bahr,  who helped create former Chancellor Willy Brandt's sympathetic Ostpolitik in  the early 1970s. "Stability can be reached only through the ability to make  reforms. A regime that does not adapt can become encrusted. And when the crusts  break off, that can be dangerous."  </P> <P> Klaus Duisberg, a Bonn official who deals with East German affairs, says: "With  or without Honecker, East Germany has to fear that if it brings in reforms in  the direction of democracy and a market economy, the entire basis for its  existence will be removed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> System Implosion  </P> <P> "But if it does nothing, there will also be destabilization. People's readiness  to make an effort for the state will fail, and over a long period, there will  be implosion of the system."  </P> <P> For years, the East German government maintained its rock-hard position because  its economy was the most prosperous in the Communist East Bloc and, according  to experts here, because East Germans are extremely attached to their heimat --  their home areas. But things are changing.  </P> <P> As one commentator put it: "In East Germany the state is as solid as stone. It  is the population that is dissolving."  </P> <P> In the past, the East German regime tended to deport political dissidents to  West Germany to get rid of potential troublemakers. But now, with 100,000 or  more young Germans leaving annually, the state is becoming denuded of the  workers it needs most.  </P> <P> </P> <P> How to Keep the Young?  </P> <P> So the problem of the government, in the view of analysts here, is how to keep  the socialist state intact but at the same time keep large numbers of young  people it cannot afford to lose from going to West Germany.  </P> <P> "The government might get tough by tightening up on visa vacations to Hungary,"  a senior diplomat said. "But this would just make the people more unhappy.  </P></p>

			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Economic Viewpoint: Currencies all a bit groggy The background to the surprise concerted intervention to support the dollar is that all the world's currencies are looking a bit groggy. By what measuring rod can such a statement be made? Not in terms of current inflation, which is lower than for 30 years. The market which has expressed most unease at the prospect for world money is, of course, that for bonds. By the arithmetic of compound discounting, bonds are sensitive even to a modest adverse shift in sentiment about inflation stretching some years ahead. There could also be less well-articulated fears that budget deficits and other calls on world savings may push up real interest rates as world recovery gathers momentum. It is, in any case, not a coincidence that the rebirth of concerted intervention by the Group of Seven industrialised countries has coincided with another upsurge of favourable indicators about the US economy. The US Treasury and Fed obviously feared that the latest indicators would - by refuelling inflation fears - turn what has really been by past standards a minor dive of the dollar into something more like a rout. It may be a funny old world where good news is treated by the financial markets as bad; but reflections on this aspect will have to wait until a calmer moment. One reason why monetary authorities are right to be sensitive to market trends is that the industrial world is just emerging from a long growth recession. (A growth recession is a rate of growth insufficient to prevent capacity utilisation from falling and unemployment from rising - and seems, in the G7 context, to occur when total output growth is less than 2 1/2 per cent per year.) Some of the recession may have been inevitable if, as the IMF suggests, the G7 began the 1990s with demand too high in relation to capacity and with a related tendency for inflation to rise. But by 1993 there was a big 'output gap' - meaning downward pressure on inflation and upward pressure on unemployment. In the present cycle, output has never fallen absolutely in the G7 countries as a unit, because the business cycle has - mercifully - not been synchronised. The English-speaking countries were the first into recession and also the first out of it. Japan and continental Europe were the last in. The developing countries, which are growing on average by 5 1/2 to 6 per cent per year, are now important enough to flourish on their own despite stagnation in the older industrial world; but they are not yet large enough to be a locomotive for the G7. For the G7 as a whole, however, the IMF forecasts imply no shrinkage of the output gap in 1994 and very little in 1995. Unemployment in the G7, which has risen from 5.7 per cent in 1990 to an expected peak of 7.4 per cent this year, is projected to drop only slightly to 7.2 per cent in 1995. Inflation on the other hand has been moving sharply downwards on average, from a temporary peak of 4.1 per cent in 1990 to an expected 2.2 per cent in 1994. The implication of these trends is that nominal GDP is still growing by a little less than the 5 per cent which would be a reasonable target consistent with trend growth and minimal inflation. The main exception to this below-par outlook is the US, where recovery is vigorous enough and has been going on long enough for the gap to vanish in the course of this year, and for the main dangers to tilt towards inflation. The UK is in a different category. There is no chance of the UK output gap vanishing. But it could shrink quickly enough to make the debate between the chancellor and the Bank governor switch in the course of this year to whether and when to raise base rates, rather than whether to cut them. The very vigorous growth in notes and coins in circulation, apparent from the British M0 statistics, would by itself be just a straw in the wind. But it has to be read in conjunction with many other indicators - for instance the UK Purchasing Managers' Index, which was established in June 1991, and which rose in April by a record amount to reach a record height. Nor can one overlook the CBI Databank showing manufacturing pay settlements - not just overtime and bonuses - turning up in the first quarter of 1994. The conclusion so far is that policies should still have a modest, if diminishing, bias towards relaxation in the G7 countries as a whole, but no longer in the English-speaking ones. Thus any tightening up in the US or Britain should be more than offset by relaxation in the continental countries and Japan. Relaxation in the former is still governed by the glacial unfreezing of German monetary policy. The more interesting case is Japan. Here the IMF expects the smallest recovery of all G7 countries - output growth of only 0.7 per cent this year. Even this is uncertain. Japanese inflation is still barely positive at just above 1 per cent, when measured conventionally by consumer prices or the GDP deflator. But producer prices, which are more exposed to international competition, are down by 2.2 per cent over a year ago. Another measure, known by the old fashioned name of 'wholesale prices' is down by 3.2 per cent. The true trend of Japanese nominal GDP is surely stagnant or downwards. The word 'deflation' is much over-used, but can in truth be applied to recent Japanese experience. Nor is it difficult to see where the weakness is coming from. In the year-and-a-half since the autumn of 1992 the exchange rate index for the yen has risen by 33 per cent. The chart makes clear that, apart from the last couple of weeks, it is the yen that has been strong rather than the dollar that has been weak. Some commentators will be quick to attribute the high yen either to the persistent, large Japanese current balance of payments surplus or to prolonged recession. But this is not too convincing, as currencies have sometimes been strong, even with current account deficits and rapid domestic growth - for example the dollar in the mid-1980s. Nor is it easy to find a monetary explanation. The narrow measures of the Japanese money supply, while certainly not soaring, have risen faster than the Japanese national income. There is probably an element of safe haven about the strength of the yen. Despite the dollar's recent weakness its underlying trend has been remarkably stable for a good three years. The same applies to the D-Mark, despite the upsurge of recent days. But the stability has been that of mutual weakness. Confidence in the dollar is wobbly, mainly because of an understandable market doubt about whether the Clinton administration will back Fed efforts to prevent a re-acceleration of inflation, or whether it even wants to preserve an anti-inflation Fed. Most informative among exchange rates - if rarely cited - is the D-Mark against the yen, which shows a strong downward trend, despite a modest contrary movement since the middle of April. It is also notable that Japan has suffered much less than other leading countries from the shakeout in international bond prices. It is some consolation that the US Treasury has called off its campaign for a higher yen and has declared - to the surprise of some financial observers  -that it does not want a lower dollar after all. Unfortunately the recent intervention has been taken at too high a yen level. Nevertheless it is now up to the Japanese to take further measures to expand demand and curb the appreciation of their currency. There have already been several stimulatory fiscal packages; and short-term interest rates are down to 1 per cent. In the context of the present international action, it may be worth trying unsterilised intervention to bring down the yen and simultaneously boost the Japanese money supply. If such efforts were blessed by a sufficiently convincing G7 consensus it is difficult to suppose that they would utterly fail. But in the not so last resort it might still be worth dropping yen notes from helicopters or burying them in the ground for private enterprise to reclaim.</p>

			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Wakeham meets big power users MR JOHN WAKEHAM stepped into the row over electricity prices between National Power and PowerGen, the electricity generators, and their big customers, when he met the Major Energy Users Council yesterday. The council has argued fiercely that generators are overcharging large industrial customers. Mr Wakeham emphasised that the government ruled out subsidies to large industrial consumers.

			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / An African Victorian without rival: Michael Holman relates scenes from the extraordinary life of Malawi's Banda MAMA has marked the questions you may not ask, said the minister. Sitting in an ante-room in Blantyre's Sanjika presidential palace, we were awaiting the summons from the Ngwazi (saviour). The vetting by 'Mama' Cecilia Kadzamira, former presidential nurse and Malawi's official hostess, was a pre-condition to Dr Hastings Kamuzu Banda's first press interview for more than 15 years. It may well have been his last. Now in his mid-90s, the combination of age and domestic opposition, unambiguously reflected in the results of Monday's referendum on multi-party elections, is bringing Dr Banda's career to an end. But when the interview took place in 1985, his ruthless authority brooked no challenge. Two years earlier three cabinet ministers had been assassinated, their deaths blamed on a car crash, victims of suspicions real or imagined. The forbidding figure who sat before me was a disquieting mix of Victorian and voodoo. His sombre three-piece suit fitted his status as an elder of the Church of Scotland. But the accompanying fly-whisk seemed a symbol of a supernatural power that leaves cabinet ministers visibly terrified in his presence. In an effort to break the ice, I began the interview by recalling that as a young schoolboy in the Rhodesian (now Zimbabwean) town of Gwelo I used to cycle past the jail where he was detained in 1959, and wonder how he was faring. Malawi's life president remained silent, seemingly glacial in his indifference. I started on my truncated question list, from which 'Mama' had removed questions about diplomatic ties with South Africa and his scorn for the Organisation of African Unity. The Ngwazi interrupted: 'Tell me more about Gwelo.' My recollections of small-town Rhodesia included a year confined to the white area of Gwelo by a government restriction order. 'The police knocked on the door at about 5.30 in the morning . . .', I began. Dr Banda interrupted again, chuckling. 'It always seems to happen around that time,' recalling his own arrest. The ice was broken. For nearly an hour he reminisced about his campaign against the Central African Federation of the Rhodesias and Nyasaland (now Malawi), the struggle for independence from Britain, and expounded his philosophy of hard work and self-sufficiency. From the day he took office in 1964 the medical doctor who trained in Edinburgh and ran a popular surgery in London imposed these values on Malawi. On a continent where authoritarian government was usually accompanied by economic mismanagement, Dr Banda's approach at first succeeded. He inherited an impoverished state with no exploitable mineral resources, 120 miles of tarred road, and a handful of university graduates. By concentrating on agriculture and encouraging commercial farming (notably tea and tobacco), and with support from aid donors, real growth in gross domestic product averaged 5 per cent until 1979. But the 1980s saw a reversal of past gains as domestic failures were compounded by external difficulties. Ministerial reluctance to offend Dr Banda impeded reform of Press Holdings, at that time a state-owned conglomerate. The president treated it as his commercial fiefdom, funding the building of several presidential palaces and other follies. Peasant farmers suffered under a crop pricing policy which benefited state coffers but eroded growers' incentives. Meanwhile the war in neighbouring Mozambique cut off landlocked Malawi's shortest routes to the sea, forcing the country to use costly alternatives through Tanzania and South Africa. Contributing to economic problems which led to a 4 per cent fall in GDP last year was the fall in foreign aid flows in response to continuing human rights abuses. During 1992 hundreds of government opponents were arrested, held for several weeks, and often tortured, said a report by Amnesty International last month. What seems unlikely is that Dr Banda will surrender power lightly or gracefully. 'I have no regrets whatsoever,' he told me as the interview ended. I saw him again, two years later, at a party rally. A frail, diminutive figure, Homburg, suit, and dark glasses, fly-whisk in hand, stepped down from the podium to join his dancing mbumba, the buxom women bedecked in cotton prints bearing his portrait. The vigilant security men relaxed. The president was safe in the bosom of the nation, only the occasional flash of the whisk above the bobbing heads revealing his presence.</p>

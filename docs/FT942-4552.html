			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Housing starts increase by 4.6% Housebuilding figures published yesterday by the government show no sign of the recent slowdown in recovery in the housing market reported by some mortgage lenders and estate agents. The figures, however, cover a period before the impact of tax increases in April and the ending of some of the cheaper fixed-rate mortgages would have been felt. More recent indications from builders suggest that the rate of improvement in new-house sales, although still higher than a year ago, has slowed in recent weeks. This has not affected output so far, according to the figures from the Department of the Environment. These show that the total number of new homes on which construction started rose by 4.6 per cent during the three months to the end of April, compared with the corresponding period last year. Total starts were also 6 per cent higher than during the previous three months. The figures have been seasonally adjusted to avoid distortions. According to the department, private-sector starts were 5 per cent higher than the previous three months and 10 per cent higher than at the same time last year. Starts made on homes for housing associations were 10 per cent higher and 11 per cent lower respectively. House sales traditionally start to decline in the summer before picking up in the autumn. Estate agents and building societies, however, are worried that public concern over interest rates is undermining fragile confidence. Bank of England figures last week showed a 14 per cent drop in new net mortgage lending. The total number of transactions in the housing market increased by 25 per cent in the six months to March, compared with the same period in the previous year, says a report by the Valuation Office, an Inland Revenue agency. House prices rose by an average of 0.66 per cent over the six months. The performance of different regions ranged from no movement in the north-west, south-west and west Midlands to a 2 per cent rise in the east Midlands.</p>

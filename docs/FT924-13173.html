			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Observer: A boon to business? Lords Hanson and White, Sir Ralph Halpern, Richard Branson and dozens of other business leaders can breathe a little more easily. They have not won this year's most embarrassing business award for Britain's Most Romantic Top Tycoon. Mills &amp; Boon, which publishes 15m copies of its bodice-ripping yarns a year, has conducted a nationwide search for Big Business's 'Mr Right' over the past six months. It contacted the personal assistants of 140 top business people and 17 replied, which sounds rather a lot. Apart from saying that the 'winning nominee has a lifestyle that will make most women swoon', Mills &amp; Boon's lips are sealed until the week after next. The only clue is that when not playing with his private helicopter and jet, the winner still finds time to cook candle-lit dinners for his 21-year-old girlfriend. This sounds rather like Richard Gabriel, 37, the multi-millionaire founder of parcel firm Interlink Express. However, a word of warning to the winner. When Mills &amp; Boon last grabbed the headlines by picking Britain's Most Romantic MP, within three years the winner had separated from his wife and lost his seat in parliament.</p>

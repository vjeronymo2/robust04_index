			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] We have been awaiting information from  Nagorno-Karabakh. It had been thought that the agreement on a  cease-fire would come into force. However, according to news  agency reports, last night was not a quiet one. Today the  Russian Foreign Ministry sent the following explanation. It  says, and I quote: It proved impossible to draft the agreement  on a cease-fire from midnight last night, although generally  positive, but differing replies have been received from Baku and  Stepanakert. The response from Nagorno-Karabakh, the Foreign  Ministry says, does not accord with Russia's latest specific  proposal. Russia is, however, continuing its efforts to bring  the positions closer together.</p>

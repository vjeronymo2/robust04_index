			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Illinois Power Company and Soyland Power Cooperative, Inc., Docket No. 50&hyph;461, Clinton Power Station, Unit No. 1, DeWitt County, Illinois  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Date of amendment request:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> August 12, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Description of amendment request:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed amendment would modify Clinton Power Station Technical Specification 3/4.6.2.2, ``Drywell Bypass Leakage,'' to allow drywell by pass leakage rate tests (DBLRTs) to be performed at intervals as long as ten years based on the demonstrated performance of the drywell structure. DBLRTs are currently required to be performed once every 18 months. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Basis of proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration which is presented below: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) The proposed change does not involve a change to the plant design or operation. As a result, the proposed change does not affect any of the parameters or conditions that contribute to initiation of any accidents previously evaluated. Thus, the proposed change cannot increase the probability of any accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed change potentially affects the leak tight integrity of the drywell, a structure used to mitigate the consequences of a loss of coolant accident (LOCA). The function of the drywell is to channel the steam released from the LOCA through the suppression pool, limiting the amount of steam released to the primary containment atmosphere. This limits the containment pressurization due to the LOCA. The leakage of the drywell is limited to ensure that the primary containment does not exceed its design limits of 185  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F and 15 psig. Because the proposed change does not alter the plant design, only the frequency of measuring the drywell leakage, the proposed change does not directly result in an increase in the drywell leakage. However, decreasing the test frequency can increase the probability that a large increase in drywell bypass leakage could go undetected for an extended period of time. There are several potential sources of steam bypass leakage paths. These include potential cracks in drywell concrete structure, the drywell vacuum breakers, and various penetrations through the drywell structure. Based on the results of the structural integrity test conducted as part of the preoperational test program, additional cracking of the drywell is not expected during the remaining life of the plant. Ventilation and piping penetrations (including the drywell vacuum breaker penetrations) are designed to ASME Code Class 2 and Seismic Category 1 requirements. These penetrations are designed with two isolation valves in series with one valve in the drywell and another either outside primary containment or in the wetwell. High energy lines that extend into the wetwell, such as the main steam lines and feedwater lines, are encapsulated by guard pipes to direct energy to the drywell in case of a piping rupture. Electrical penetrations are sealed with a high strength/density material that will prevent leakage as well as provide radiation shielding. Operational experience has shown that the leak tightness of the drywell has maintained well below the allowable leakage limits. In fact, the calculated drywell bypass leakage area is of such a small magnitude that containment design pressure could not be exceeded even if containment spray and heat sinks were not available. The technical specification limit of 10% of the maximum allowable leakage path area provides margin for degradation. Drywell performance data to date suggest that drywell degradation, even during a ten-year interval between tests, will not exceed this margin. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, an analysis was conducted to determine the potential risk to the public from unacceptable drywell bypass leakage going undetected as a result of the proposed change. Based on this analysis, under several different accident scenarios, the risk of radioactivity release from containment was found to be negligible, about 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 --> ^9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  per year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the above, Illinois Power has concluded that the proposed change will not result in a significant increase in the consequences of any accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The proposed change does not involve a change to the plant design or operation. As a result, the proposed change does not affect any of the parameters or conditions that could contribute to initiation of any accidents. Thus, the proposed change cannot create the possibility of an accident not previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The proposed change only affects the frequency of measuring the drywell leakage and does not change the bypass leakage limit for the drywell. However, the proposed change can increase the probability that a large increase in drywell bypass leakage could go undetected for an extended period of time. Operational experience has shown that the leak tightness of the drywell has been maintained well below the allowable leakage limits. In fact, the calculated drywell bypass leakage area is of such a small magnitude that containment design pressure could not be exceeded even if containment spray and heat sinks were not available. Further, an analysis was conducted to determine the potential risk to the public from the proposed change. Based on this analysis, under several different accident scenarios, the risk of radioactivity release from containment was found to be negligible, about 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 --> ^9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  per year. As a result, Illinois Power has concluded that the proposed change will not result in a significant reduction in the margin of safety. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Local Public Document Room location:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Vespasian Warner Public Library, 120 West Johnson Street, Clinton, Illinois 61727. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Attorney for licensee:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Leah Manning Stetzner, Vice President, General Counsel, and Corporate Secretary, 500 South 27th St., Decatur, IL 62525. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> NRC Project Director:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> John N.

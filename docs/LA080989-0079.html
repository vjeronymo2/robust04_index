			<p><P> August 9, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DOCTOR TESTIFIES FOR DEFENSE IN MCMARTIN TRIAL;  </P> <P> 3 OF 5 ALLEGED VICTIMS SHOW NO SIGNS OF SEX ABUSE, HE DECLARES  </P> <P> A British physician called by the defense in the McMartin Pre-School  molestation trial testified Tuesday that three of the five alleged victims he  has been questioned about so far showed no physical signs of sexual abuse.  </P> <P> London city coroner David M. Paul, who also works at the University of London  Hospital and is a consultant on forensic medicine, said under questioning by  lawyer Dean Gits that he reviewed medical records and anatomical slides of the  children but found nothing suggesting molestation in most.  </P> <P> He characterized some slides, projected before the jury, as showing "perfectly  normal" body parts, and dismissed what appeared to be abnormalities in others  as "of no significance."  </P> <P> Prosecutors, who earlier called six physicians to testify, maintain that  scarring and other physical signs of prior abuse are present in nine of the 11  children who have accused Raymond Buckey or his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey,  of rape, sodomy, oral copulation and other criminal sexual acts.  </P> <P> Paul took issue with the medical findings and even their terminology, and  testified that the doctors were either mistaken, negligent or inconsistent. He  also criticized their use of the colposcope, a camera-like machine that takes  magnified three-dimensional photographs and renders repeated examinations  unnecessary.  </P> <P> "You've got to be jolly careful when you magnify things up," he said,  explaining that the process can make many normal objects appear to be abnormal.  </P> <P> Paul said he has examined more than 2,000 children for molestation over the  last three decades.  </P> <P> While in three cases Paul said he found no evidence consistent with  molestation, in one other he hedged and in a fifth he testified that the child  indeed had been sexually assaulted.  </P> <P> Referring to the findings of two physicians who examined the 2 1/2-year-old boy  whose mother's report to Manhattan Beach police triggered the nursery school  investigation, Paul said: "I don't believe they're even consistent with  sodomy." He said, however, there were medical signs that could be interpreted  as evidence that the child had suffered lesser sexual abuse.  </P> <P> Of another alleged victim, a girl who was examined at age 9, Paul said slides  of her vaginal area reveal "gross abnormalities . . . sufficient to say it is  diagnostic of child sexual abuse," probably by digital penetration. The girl  testified earlier that Ray Buckey had inserted his fingers into her at the  prestigious Manhattan Beach nursery school, and that his mother had touched her  on the outside.  </P> <P> The defense has said from the beginning of the trial -- now in its 28th month  -- that several of the alleged victims may indeed have been molested, but by  someone other than the Buckeys.  </P> <P> Refuting extensive medical evidence presented by the prosecution is crucial to  the defense's case, and Paul is expected to be their last witness before the  trial enters its rebuttal phase.  </P></p>

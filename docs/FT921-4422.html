			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / UK Company News: UK side helps TDG advance to Pounds 38.9m A STRONG performance in the UK helped Transport Development Group, Britain's second largest haulier, report a small advance in profits from Pounds 38.2m to Pounds 38.9m for the year to December 31. However, extraordinary charges of Pounds 18.6m (Pounds 4m) forced the group to dip into reserves to pay its dividend. The bulk of the provisions were due to expected losses on the US operation, which is up for sale. The closure costs of loss-making UK businesses accounted for Pounds 6m of the charge. The result was achieved on turnover up by almost Pounds 3.7m to Pounds 584.3m. Operating profits in the UK improved by Pounds 2m to Pounds 32.3m. Sir James Duncan, chairman, said 'good housekeeping' in the storage division had helped boost profits substantially. The hire business had also remained profitable. TDG's operations in France had taken a severe beating from recession in the latter part of the year, with profits down by 66 per cent to Pounds 1.2m. The return from continental Europe as a whole was Pounds 1m higher at Pounds 9.8m. In the US, two of the three businesses had been sold, while the remaining transport company, Willig Freight Lines, reported a loss. Sir James said TDG was determined to pull out of the US. The group intended to keep a tight rein on capital expenditure, said Sir James, which totalled Pounds 64m in 1991 compared with Pounds 81m last time. So far the group had seen no sign of a pick up in any of its markets, he added. In France 'it is even getting a little tougher'. The chairman stressed the strength of the balance sheet. Gearing is just one point higher at 18.8 per cent. Earnings per share were virtually static at 17.6p (17.7p). A same again final divided of 6.5p is proposed to maintain the total at 9.5p. COMMENT TDG seems to be heading down the right road. Cost-cutting is estimated to be saving between Pounds 1.5m and Pounds 2m a year. The biggest cost benefits are likely to come in the UK, with little movement up or down in continental Europe. The sorry picture painted of France offers no hope of an easier recessionary ride there, but there are expansion opportunities elsewhere. Meanwhile, the almost 20 per cent stake held by Proventus, the Swedish investor, will help to buoy the shares as punters look for a potential bidder. But the most obvious candidates - such as P&amp;O - have their own problems and are unlikely to approach TDG for a while yet. Forecasts of Pounds 43m for next year include a touch of organic growth and some cost savings benefits. The multiple of 13.7 leaves shares fully valued - at least until until Proventus sheds its stake.</p>

			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN LEFT;  </P> <P> HYPING DOOM FOR THE SOVIET ECONOMY;  </P> <P> MOSCOW'S WANNABE YUPPIES HAVE A VESTED INTEREST IN MAKING THE SITUATION LOOK  WORSE.  </P> <P> If there's one craggy outcrop of fact in a sea of uncertainty, it's surely that  the Soviet economy is in dreadful shape. Everybody says so, most of all the  free-marketeers in Moscow who are massed behind that salesman of a 500-day dash  to privatization, Stanislav S. Shatalin.  </P> <P> But as we'll see, much of this doomsday scenario is self-interested propaganda.  </P> <P> Start with some basic data. The Soviet Union is the world's largest producer of  crude oil and in 1989 was the largest oil exporter, too, at 3.7 million barrels  a day. Since it no longer must export at deflated prices to Eastern Europe, it  stands to gain an extra $24 billion or more just from oil this year.  </P> <P> The Soviet Union is the world's leading producer of steel, large-diameter pipe,  chemicals, fertilizer, cement, synthetic rubber and aluminum. Between 1967 and  1989 its industrial production doubled, and the U.S. government estimated that  between 1985 and 1989 its gross national product increased at a rate of 2% per  annum, the same as West Germany's. And although there are problems with the  harvest, the fact remains that the 1990 Soviet grain crop is the largest in the  nation's history.  </P> <P> A couple of weeks ago I met my old friend Lynn Turgeon, retired this year from  his post as professor of economics, specializing in the Soviet Union and  Eastern Europe, at Hofstra University. Turgeon had just returned from a  two-week trip to the Soviet Union, especially the Upper Volga. He's been going  to the Soviet Union since 1966 -- 11 trips in all -- and so has a pretty good  historical perspective.  </P> <P> "Contrary to all the dire reporting, supplies -- mainly food but also stuff in  department stores -- are better than they were four years ago," he said. "I  always collect farm market prices and have been doing so for many years. This  time my hobby paid off. In the United States you'll see estimates of a 10%  inflation rate in the Soviet Union, but in fact this increase is confined to  Moscow and Leningrad, and outside those cities there was no increase in  repressed inflation."  </P> <P> Get out of the two major cities to some-place like Voronezh, and pork is five  times cheaper, Turgeon says. And those stories of bread and riots and scarcity?  He thinks they are much exaggerated, to drum up support for Shatalin's 500-day  plan to convert to a so-called market economy: "There's a symbiosis of interest  between what I term the 'socialist bourgeoisie' in Moscow and Western  reporters.  </P> <P> "The socialist bourgeoisie are hellbent on getting convertible rubles so they  can pick up their VCRs and porno cassettes when they travel. They are anxious  for the Yuppie life and you can't have that without a convertible ruble. Most  Russians don't travel and couldn't care less about convertibility."  </P> <P> Turgeon emphasized one thing I'd noticed in Moscow a couple of years ago -- the  tendency of the Muscovite intelligentsia to hysteria, leaping from one puddle  of gossip, half-baked information and bogus theorizing to another. They aren't  to be trusted to get anything straight. Yet the "reformers" who solemnly told  the U.S. Congress that CIA growth estimates were wrong by a factor of four were  treated with the utmost seriousness. The Soviet Friedmanites have an ax to  grind -- the need for crash conversion -- and will say anything, however silly  and incredible, to buttress their case.  </P> <P> For their part, Western journalists are eager for anything negative about the  Soviet economy. So the Russian socialist bourgeoisie produce stories of  disaster; the journalists enlarge their significance and then the Muscovite  intelligentsia quote these Western stories back as evidence of the need for  crisis action.  </P> <P> Of course these journalists mostly stick to Moscow and Leningrad. They don't  see the relative abundances of the country-side or the unwillingness of  producers to ship to the two cities, whose officials largely blame political  resentments and uncertainty about the ruble for such dislocation.  </P> <P> Turgeon argues that the existing economic program is doing better than is  generally recognized, though the rate is slow and therefore infuriating to  Russians waiting for magic changes. People who believe in magic will say  anything, particularly if reporters are standing ready to write it all down.  Shatalin admits to being a devotee of astrology, as is an increasing number of  Muscovites. This is to be expected from naive worshipers of the "free market"  with its "hidden hand," as is the likelihood that, if given their head, they  can gravely injure a fundamentally powerful economy.  </P></p>

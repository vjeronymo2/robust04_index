			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Let market forces dictate on milk Blaming the CAP for the current traumas of the UK dairy industry overlooks the fact that all other EU countries have dynamic and relatively stable dairy industries without Milk Marketing Boards. Also, the whole of Europe has excess capacity following milk quotas. Your leader 'Milk shakes' (August 24) welcomes deregulation of the market, as we do, but the question is how to transit from A to B. The problem has been caused by the Milk Marketing Board inventing the new scheme - self-preservation rules. The alternative would be to 'jump start' direct trade between producers and processors, and then allow the market forces to determine prices, as in the rest of Europe. A scheme along these lines has been put to government in Northern Ireland but, so far, it appears to have fallen on deaf ears.

			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Survey: FT Traveller, Genoa (1) - A look back to the future / First Impressions, Nowhere else do the normally chauvinistic Italians play so strongly the foreign card 'TO UNDERSTAND Genoa, you have to understand the British,' is the cliche regularly quoted to any remotely Anglo-Saxon visitor to Italy's biggest port, now belatedly rediscovering its cultural heritage as an instrument to counter years of economic decline. Nowhere else do the normally chauvinistic Italians play so strongly the foreign card. And nowhere else is the link so close with the UK. From Genoa's heyday in the early Middle Ages as a mercantile city-state and traditional rival of Venice, the relationship stretches through centuries of two-way trade and a flow of tourism and culture which has tended to move more in one direction than the other. Always important for the British in their Mediterranean commerce, the arrival of the Suez Canal made Genoa a vital stop for points further east as well, notably India. Soon, the British aristocrats, who had already discovered the mild breezes and jasmine gardens of the Riviera on either side of the city, were joined by less titled, but equally well-heeled, Britons who made the city and its surroundings a staging post on their way to India and beyond. Sojourns in Riviera watering holes became more than just a way of avoiding the beastly British winter. For those either returning to the UK from the colonies or just setting out, a spell on the Riviera became an acceptable way of adjusting to the climatic changes ahead. Climate and culture also appealed to the region's most famous British visitors, the Romantic poets. The bay of La Spezia, 75 miles south of Genoa, is still sometimes sold to the tourists as the 'Bay of Poets'. Byron used to swim regularly in Portovenere, just north of La Spezia. In 1822, the Shelleys rented a small house near the village of Lerici opposite. Sailing along the coast from Leghorn to La Spezia on his way home Shelley drowned. With the bicentenary of his birth this year, the number of British literary tourists is bound to surge. Genoa still makes much of its Anglo-Saxon links, a factor often cited today to explain its charms and failings. For fellow Italians, the Genovese are a dull lot; cool and reserved, they speak a barely comprehensible dialect and seldom display the extrovert verve usually associated with their fellow nationals. Like the Piedmontese to the north, they are also known throughout Italy for a caution with money which is associated more with the Scottish than the English. The Anglo-Saxon air still hangs over parts of the city, though more in terms of manners and society than art or architecture. Though exaggerated by their fellow Italians, the tradition of reserve remains. Genoa's rich do not flaunt their wealth like those in Milan and especially Rome. Money is suggested rather than seen behind the high hedges and wrought-iron gates of their big villas perched on the hills near the Staglieno cemetery towering over the city. Visitors to Genoa are often carted off to Finollo, an old-fashioned tie and shirt maker on elegant via Roma, to savour for themselves the city's Anglo-Saxon air. The dark and narrow store, full of ties in regimental stripes, certainly recalls some of its counterparts in London's Jermyn Street. But it is a measure of popular misunderstanding about the UK that the shop, whose proprietors seem to have confused the distant politeness of the British with a patronising smugness, verging on the rude, should so often be used as a showcase. Such self-satisfaction is at the heart of many of Genoa's problems, which have dogged it for decades and which partly explain why its corner of the famous economic triangle with Milan and Turin has shown signs of lapsing. 'Genoa's error is a bit like the problems of the British,' says Mr Carlo Da Molo, chairman of Italgas, one of Italy's leading companies, and a born Genovese. Over the past three decades, the city failed to adapt to changing economic circumstances and continued to rely heavily on the port as its main source of livelihood. 'They didn't appreciate that things were changing', says Mr Riccardo Garrone, a leading Genovese businessman whose ERG group is the biggest private-sector petroleum company in Italy. The complaints are levelled as much at the state as the private sector. After the Second World War, public money poured into the bomb-scarred city to rebuild heavy industry and set up new activities, notably in steel. Meanwhile, more cash was ploughed into the port, as much in later years to cover inefficiencies and restrictive labour practices as to adapt to new trends, such as containerisation. Change came only when the political balance tilted away from the hard left, which dominated both the port and local politics, or when the inefficiencies of both became too obvious to ignore. The bell began to toll for the steel industry in the late 1960s, when production started to shift to southern Italy. Though largely a political decision, the move was also in recognition of the fact that Genoa's narrow coastal strip, bounded by mountains and the sea, hardly lent itself to the development of large-scale, integrated steelworks. Meanwhile, shipbuilding suffered at the hands of cheaper foreign competition, and production of the biggest vessels was eventually concentrated elsewhere. Yet, the accusation of short-sightedness is levelled as strongly at Genoa's private sector. Geared to shipping and trade, the city boasts next to no private-sector industry, apart from the small Piaggio aircraft group and the remains of the now partly-privatised steel business. Showing native caution, Genoa's businessmen tended to stick to what they knew best, maintaining their traditions as merchants rather than entrepreneurs. Others suffered indirectly from the slow decline of the port. 'There were no industrialists in the private sector,' says Mr Garrone. 'And the big private companies that did exist were too divided among themselves to organise as a lobby to press for change'. Arguably, the development of much better communications from the late 1950s, with excellent motorway links between Genoa and the big cities of the north, may have encouraged the tendency towards individualism. Local businessmen, frustrated by left-wing politics locally, may have preferred to invest in the growing areas of Lombardy and Piedmont to the north rather than Genoa itself. Others may have chosen the less legal, but well-trodden, route to Switzerland for their flight capital. 'Our refinery had to be closed because its chimneys released private-sector smoke,' recalls a still bitter Mr Garrone. 'But the fumes from the Italsider steelworks were good, because they were public-sector fumes,' he says angrily. 'Mind you, as soon as it went private, it also came under attack.' Though most critical of the hard left councils which governed Genoa for years, he sees the city's recent past as having been tainted with a general hostility to the private sector that went beyond the Communists to influence other political groups, too. The changes in Genoa today may be too sudden and dramatic to last. But the optimists hope financial stringency in the public-sector will prove salutary in stimulating a concentration only on activities which are viable. At the port, partial privatisation of some operations and the construction of a huge new container terminal at Voltri to the west have offered the chance of regaining a role as the foremost trading post in the Mediterranean. Meanwhile, local politics have taken a significant move towards the centre with the arrival of a soft-left council two years ago. Looking ahead, many Genovese point to the Christopher Columbus exhibition as providing the spur to regenerate after decades of delay. Further off, but even more important in its potential economic effect, is the planned high-speed rail link with Milan. That could cut the journey time from two hours to around 40 minutes. But rather than seeing themselves as potential losers to their bigger neighbour to the north, the Genovese are confident their city will be the clear beneficiary from such an improvement in communications. The link would make the coast far more accessible to northern Italians, for whom Genoa would be the gateway. It may not trigger the development of new heavy industry, but the high-speed line could be just the incentive for creating the new service sector activities the city is looking for.</p>

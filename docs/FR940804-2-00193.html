If these areas do not correct the outstanding deficiencies before the effective date of the ``Selection of Sequence of Mandatory Sanctions Rule'' (sanctions rule), which is found in today's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  in the rules section and becomes effective September 6, 1994, these areas would be subject to sanctions. The sanctions rule describes in detail the process by which sanctions will apply to areas that do not meet deadlines specified in the Act and for which findings are made.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As noted in the list, the vast majority of areas plan to take corrective action before the sanctions rule goes into effect. However, any area that does not take the required action before that time will be subject to the 2 to 1 emissions offset sanction (offset sanction) as provided by the Act. Futhermore, in most cases, if EPA has not determined that the deficiency has been corrected within 6 months of the imposition of the offset sanction, the second sanction, affecting Federal highway funding, will also apply.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESS(ES): <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Air Docket A&hyph;94&hyph;41, The Air and Radiation Docket and Information Center (6202), Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St. SW., Room M&hyph;1500, Washington, DC 20460.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </ADDRESS> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The table below lists those areas with active sanctions clocks resulting from a finding. This table should not be used as the sole guide to determine which areas will be subject to sanctions when the sanctions rule goes into effect. In fact, it is likely that today's list may be obsolete with respect to many areas by the effective date of the sanctions rule because these areas will have corrected the relevant deficiency by that date. It is important to note that the enclosed table reflects only those areas for which clocks had expired as of July 15, 1994 or is projected to expire through August 31, 1994. There are other sanctions clocks running under the Act (e.g., any area that has not yet made a complete submission to EPA for State implementation plan (SIP) elements due on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> November 15, 1993). In the future, other sanction clocks will be initiated if EPA finds that a State has failed to make a required submittal, if EPA determines that a State submittal is incomplete, if EPA disapproves a State submission, or if a State fails to implement an approved plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The EPA will periodically provide the public with access to updated information through the Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards' Technology Transfer Network computer bulletin board system and through updates of this information in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . These updates will indicate cases in which sanctions have been deferred or stayed, delete areas for which EPA has made a final determination that the deficiencies prompting the findings have been corrected, and add additional areas as findings are made triggering sanctions clocks. Furthermore, EPA will publish a notice with a similar table, as appropriate, for areas that later may be subject to the highway sanction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For each area potentially subject to the offset sanction on the effective date of the sanctions rule, the table below identifies the State, the affected area, the type of finding the area received, the SIP element, the pollutants affected by the offset sanction, the date the sanctions clock expires, and the corrective actions needed to stop the sanctions clock.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ``Affected Area'' column lists the area in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which the offset sanction would apply if the deficiencies are not corrected by the effective date of the sanctions rule. For more information on the boundaries of any listed area, the public can refer to 40 CFR part 81,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which sets forth the designations for areas and establishes their boundaries. Footnoted areas are included because a SIP submittal was disapproved. All other areas are included as a result of a finding of nonsubmittal or incompleteness. The full set of letters reflecting the findings of nonsubmittal or incompleteness that EPA has already issued can be found in Air Docket A&hyph;94&hyph;41. Please refer to the sanctions rule for a discussion on the significance of finding type.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ``State Implementation Plan Element'' column describes the SIP element on which the finding was based. Abbreviations are as follows: VOC_volatile organic compounds, CO_carbon monoxide, NOx_nitrogen oxides,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> PM&hyph;10_particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers. The SIP elements and their respective sections in the Act are as follows: VOC Reasonably Available Control Technology Fix-ups_section 182(a)(2)(A); PM&hyph;10 SIP Attainment Demonstration_section 189(a); Emission Statements_section 182(a)(3)(B); PM&hyph;10 New Source Review_sections 172(c)(5) and 189(a)(1)(A); Basic Vehicle Inspection and Maintenance_for ozone, section 182(b)(4), and for CO, section 187(a)(4); Enhanced Vehicle Inspection and Maintenance_section 182(c)(3)(A); VOC Reasonably Available Control Technology Catch-up_section 182(b)(2); NOx Reasonably Available Control Technology Rules_section 182(b)(2) and (f); Employer Commute Option Program_section 182(d)(2); Oxygenated Fuels_for serious areas, section 187(b)(3) and for moderate areas, section 211(m); CO Contingency Measures_section 187(a)(3); CO Attainment Demonstration_section 187(a)(7).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ``Pollutants Affected'' column describes which pollutants and their precursors would be affected should the offset sanction be applied. The preamble of the sanctions rule explains when precursors will be subject to the offset sanction. The ``Date Sanction Clock Expires'' column is the date the 18-month sanction clock expires. In the future, this column will include information on the deferral and stay of any sanction under &sect;52.31(d) of the sanctions rule. The ``Corrective Actions Needed'' column provides specific actions that must be completed to stop imposition of sanctions for each area on the list.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

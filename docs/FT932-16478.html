			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Sport of kings run on a shoestring: The Grand National fiasco comes at a lean time for horseracing HOW did it happen? How did a sport like horseracing, which generates billions in betting turnover, manage to fall so painfully on its face? How did the Grand National steeplechase at Aintree racecourse in Liverpool end in fiasco on Saturday? After weeks, or even months, of infighting and buck-passing the finger of blame will be pointed at two groups: the Jockey Club, which runs British racing, and the management of Aintree racecourse. In spite of the billions bet on horseracing, it remains an amateurish sport at many levels - including that of the racecourses, many of which are owned by small companies run by people with inadequate training, aptitude or skills. Some racecourses - such as Ascot, owned by the Queen - are nests of snobbery. Racecourses and the sport in general are suffering from the recession. The 59 British racecourses saw estimated revenues of Pounds 64m in 1991, while their costs were about Pounds 77m. However, they received Pounds 7.1m in 1991 from the Horserace Betting Levy Board, which levies bookmakers' turnover and allocates funds for the benefit of racing. This reduced their overall deficit that year to an estimated Pounds 6.8m, against Pounds 5.3m the previous year. Many courses are run on a shoestring and their facilties are often poor, relying on the services of low-paid helpers and officials. Although recent tax improvements, including VAT changes in the last Budget, will eventually help the sport, its fortunes have suffered in recent years as owners have sold out or reduced their involvements because of rising costs and lower prize money. Britain's 9,000 racehorse owners shouldered a total deficit in 1990 estimated by the sport at Pounds 152m. By now it may be greater. Between 1985 and 1992 the number of racehorse trainers fell from 1,018 to around 860, leading to more than 1,000 job losses in the racing world. And the total number of horses in training - both flat and National Hunt - fell from 14,000 to 11,500. Meanwhile, the stewards of the Jockey Club met at their London headquarters yesterday to discuss how to minimise the damage done by the race being declared void. A full inquiry has now been ordered. The race was declared void after officials failed to halt a majority of the horses and their jockeys following the second of two false starts. An estimated Pounds 60m in UK betting turnover now has to be refunded to punters, while the government lost tax revenues and bookmakers lost hundreds of thousands of pounds in marketing expenses. However, William Hill, the bookmaker, has decided not to pursue its loss through legal action. It had been considering a claim for negligence against the Jockey Club and Aintree racecourse. The chain said: 'If we pressed a case against Aintree, as we would have to, it could bankrupt the course.' William Hill has 1,800 betting shops and took about Pounds 15m in Grand National bets. The company said it had spent about Pounds 200,000 on pre-race marketing and administration. The biggest bookmaker, Ladbroke, with about 2,000 shops, said it handled about 25 per cent of the amount bet on the race. Meanwhile, Mr John Major dismissed the idea that the fiasco has affected Manchester's chances of hosting the 2000 Olympic Games. After a visit to the Swiss headquarters of the international Olympic Committee as part of his effort to boost Manchester's bid, the prime minister said: 'Someone made a mistake. It went wrong. That has to be set against a British sporting reputation built up over generations.'</p>

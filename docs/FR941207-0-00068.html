			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> States that expect to seek funding under this program in fiscal year 1996 or thereafter are encouraged to review the status of victim rights measures in their systems, particularly with reference to the five areas identified above. Federal law incorporates significant measures in each of these areas for federal cases. The provisions of federal law governing these issues may be useful for states as a possible model for reform, if they have not already adopted similar measures in their own systems. See 42 U.S.C. 10606(b)(3), (7), 10607(c) (notice concerning case and offender status); 42 U.S.C. 10606(b)(4) (right to be present at public court proceedings); Rule 32 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, as amended effective December 1, 1994 (right of allocution in sentencing for victims); 18 U.S.C. 3663, 3553(c) (general restitution provisions for federal cases); 42 U.S.C. 10607(a) and (b), 10607(c)(5) (assignment of responsibility for victim-related functions).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Truth in Sentencing Incentive Grants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To be eligible to receive funding under the Truth in Sentencing Grant Program, in addition to meeting the assurances listed in Subtitle A, states must also meet certain sentencing requirements. In particular, to qualify for this part of the grant program, states must have in effect sentencing laws that either provide for violent offenders to (1) serve not less than 85 percent of their sentences, or (2) meet other requirements that ensure that violent offenders, and especially repeat violent offenders, remain incarcerated for substantially greater percentages of their imposed sentences.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Office of Justice Programs is aware that the vast majority of states will at present have difficulty in meeting the condition that violent offenders serve at least 85 percent of the sentence imposed. No specific guidance for complying with this assurance is prescribed at this time both because funding for this program is not available in FY '95, and also because of the need for further review of state compliance issues. Moreover, we are particularly interested in comments from the field on compliance issues and on the definition of ``violent offender'' for purposes of truth in sentencing grant awards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> FY 1995 Correctional Boot Camp Initiative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The availability of funds each year is, of course, limited by the appropriations process. In fiscal year 1995, Congress has allocated $24.5 million to Subtitle A grant programs and has imposed additional limitations on the uses of these grant funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consistent with congressional intent, grant awards in fiscal year 1995 will be for construction-related costs of correctional boot camps and will be allocated through the discretionary grant component of the Violent Offender Incarceration Grant Program. Construction-related costs are broadly interpreted to include costs associated with both the planning and development of the facility. OJP is expressly precluded, however, from funding operating expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specifically, grant funds can be used to plan, develop, construct, or expand adult and juvenile boot camp programs which must include coordinated, intensive aftercare services for inmates following release. Pursuant to the requirements specified in Subtitle A, boot camps are correctional programs of no longer than six-months incarceration and must: (1) Exclude offenders who have at any time been convicted of a violent felony or similarly adjudicated juveniles, (2) adhere to a regimented schedule, (3) provide for inmate participation in education, job training and substance abuse counseling or treatment, and (4) coordinate intensive aftercare services with the services provided during the period of confinement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The program emphasis in fiscal year 1995 will be on the construction, renovation and expansion of correctional boot camp facilities that will free conventional prison, jail and juvenile correctional space for the confinement of violent offenders so they can serve a substantial amount of their imposed sentences. To receive funds, correctional systems will have to demonstrate, through a comprehensive correctional plan and prisoner screening and security classification system, that (1) there is a need for additional secure confinement space for violent offenders, and (2) this need will be met through the construction of a boot camp facility that provides housing otherwise unavailable for nonviolent offenders.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to juvenile facilities, priority will be given to juvenile boot camps that are designed to prevent juvenile offenders at risk from becoming violent offenders. This desired outcome will most likely be accomplished if the jurisdiction engages in efforts that maximize the likelihood that juvenile boot camp participants would otherwise be incarcerated in traditional secure facilities (e.g., participation limited to those youths who have been adjudicated delinquents and who have been sentenced to the juvenile state correctional agency). Among this population, juvenile offenders whose escalating patterns of delinquent behavior indicate that an authoritative boot camp intervention is likely to suppress or abate emerging tendencies towards chronic or violent delinquent behavior should be considered prime candidates for boot camp participation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To be eligible to receive grants for correctional boot camp construction, states must meet the eligibility criteria outlined for the Violent Offender Incarceration Grant Program, including the assurances specified in Section 20101(b) of Subtitle A.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Detailed program guidelines and application material for the fiscal year 1995 correctional boot camp initiative will be available in January 1995. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

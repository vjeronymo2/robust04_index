			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Argentine Judge Suspends Sale of Airline: Administrative Law Judge Oscar Garzon  Funes suspended the sale of the state-owned airline Aerolineas Argentinas to  Iberia of Spain because the proposed buyers made the down payment by letter of  credit instead of cash. Funes gave the Public Works Ministry eight days to  explain why it accepted the letter of credit, after which he said he would  decide whether to annul the sale. A consortium led by Spain's state airline  Iberia agreed in July to buy 85% of Aerolineas for $260 million and the  retirement of $2 billion of Argentina's foreign debt.  </P></p>

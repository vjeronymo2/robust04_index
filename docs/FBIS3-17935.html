He became a source of a little -- albeit unpleasant for  Russian politicians -- sensation. Upon arriving in Alma-Ata  [Almaty] on an official visit just a few days before Yeltsin's  meeting with Nazarbayev, Perry sent to Moscow a thoroughly  confidential document. Your MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS correspondent  has learned from official sources that the document signaled the  Americans' readiness to act as a middleman between Russia and  Kazakhstan in talks on the fate of Baykonur (of course, if the  CIS countries themselves ask the White House to do so).    Evidently, the U.S. secretary's initiative is scarcely of  any  real value: at this moment relations between the two -- albeit  former -- union republics wholly enable them to talk directly,  without an interpreter.    But Moscow was politely reminded yet another time that a  situation where Kazakhstan was in Russia's unquestioned sphere  of influence is receding into the past. Indeed, investment  attracted into the Central Asian country to finance specific  projects alone already exceed $20 billion.    On the other hand, the document has elicited a certain  distrust from Russian leaders: What if Perry has actually  agreed on something behind the Kremlin's back while in Alma-Ata  [Almaty] (which, as a matter of fact, may well be the case, too).    Although a document on Baykonur, among other things, was  signed during the meeting between Yeltsin and Nazarbayev, which  is considered very successful, one is getting the impression  that the Moscow leaders find it more and more difficult to talk  with their partners in the language of stern demands (including  about military bases). Perry's letter appears to have played a  part in bringing this about.</p>

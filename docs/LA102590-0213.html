			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CUSTODIANS THREATEN TO WALK OFF JOBS  </P> <P> Labor organizers say janitors who clean six of Glendale's new office towers are  threatening to walk off the job early next month in protest of low wages and a  lack of benefits. Organizers charge that the plight of custodians is in sharp  contrast to the salaries and benefits earned by office workers and managers in  the buildings they service.  </P> <P> To demonstrate their position and muster courage among themselves, about 50  custodians and their supporters staged a noon rally last Friday on a patio at  the Glendale Superior Court building at Broadway and Glendale Avenue.  </P> <P> Wearing red Justice for Janitors T-shirts, protesters marched in circles under  a courthouse olive tree, sang songs and carried signs as passersby gawked and  drivers honked.  </P> <P> Bill Ragen, project director of Justice for Janitors, a committee of Service  Employees International Union, said workers are protesting what they believe is  unfair treatment by Bradford Building Services of Los Angeles, the largest  non-union maintenance firm in Southern California.  </P> <P> Ragen said Bradford employees are paid the minimum wage of $4.25 an hour and  receive no benefits, while union workers with other companies earn an average  of $6 an hour and have family health insurance, sick leave and vacations.  </P> <P> Larry Smith, president of Bradford, denied the union's allegations. "Our wage  rates run typically from $4.85 to $10 an hour," he said, and workers usually  receive some benefits, depending on individual contracts with building  managers.  </P> <P> Smith said his company and union organizers have been battling in the courts  and before the National Labor Relations Board for 10 years. He declined to  discuss the actions in detail because of pending litigation. However, Smith  said there are 2,600 other cleaning contractors in Southern California, "most  of which are non-union."  </P> <P> Ragen said union organizers have targeted the Glendale area during the last two  months because of the community's growing prominence as a labor and  service-based economy. "The janitors are organizing to make sure that the shift  does not mean a two-tier economy which forces the new service-sector workers to  live in poverty," Ragen said.  </P> <P> Jono Shaffer, a labor organizer who accompanied demonstrators with his guitar,  said all of the Bradford employees in Glendale have signed union authorization  cards and have voted to support a strike, if necessary.  </P> <P> However, Shaffer said the union does not formally represent workers because an  election has not been held. "An election is really a bureaucratic process which  we don't use anymore," Shaffer said. "We see no need to get bogged down in the  lengthy, drawn-out process." Instead, he asked that the company "listen to what  their workers are saying."  </P> <P> Ragen said demands by custodians are often ignored by managers until they  strike. He said about 45 employees at Glendale buildings are ready to walk out,  probably early next month.  </P> <P> The buildings targeted are at 330, 505, 550, 611 and 801 N. Brand Blvd. and at  700 N. Central Ave. -- all cleaned under contractual agreements with Bradford.  </P> <P> About 140 workers participated in a protest march in Glendale in September  outside two high-rise office buildings serviced by Bradford. During that  protest, Glendale police watched but did not interfere.  </P> <P> On June 15, a larger Justice for Janitors march against another firm in Century  City led to a violent confrontation with baton-wielding Los Angeles police,  resulting in 40 arrests and 16 injuries.  </P> <P> During Friday's demonstration in Glendale, union organizers instructed  participants in "civil disobedience." Some workers linked arms to simulate  blocking an entrance to a building, while others, with paper stars pinned to  their shirts, played the roles of arresting officers.  </P> <P> One worker who was arrested in the Century City demonstration urged her  co-workers not to be afraid. "I was afraid when I did it, but not now," she  said in Spanish.  </P> <P> Another custodian, employed in Glendale, said: "I hope that we are not forced  to go out on strike. But if we must, we will, because our cause is a just one."  </P></p>

			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / East Midlands capital outlay 'to increase' More companies in the east Midlands plan to raise capital spending than at any time since 1990, the latest survey of business performance in the region shows. The survey of 946 companies by Price Waterhouse, accountants, and Nottingham Business School which is published today shows 37 per cent of companies plan an increase in capital spending and only 22 per cent a reduction. 'The difference between the two of 15 percentage points is the highest since spring 1990, before the recession began,' it says. Greater enthusiasm for capital spending follows a rise in sales volume - 70 per cent of companies in September reported higher sales compared with 63 per cent in March. Business confidence is at its highest since before the recession, with 75 per cent of companies expecting increased sales in the next six months. Concern about rising raw material prices and tight profit margins - often expressed in company financial results - did not crop up in the survey and does not yet appear to be affecting general confidence. Prospects for business growth and employment in north-west England are much better than a year ago, says a survey published today, Daniel Green writes. The latest in a series of annual studies by Manchester Business School and accountants Price Waterhouse says 36 per cent of 500 companies surveyed expect to employ more people in the next six months. This compares with 26 per cent a year ago. East Midlands Business Survey Autumn 1994. Price Waterhouse, Victoria House, 76 Milton Street, Nottingham NG1 3QY. Statistics Pounds 75, summary free.</p>

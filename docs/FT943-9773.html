			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Trade Indemnity sees business failures fall Trade Indemnity, the trade credit insurance company, yesterday demonstrated the impact of an improving economy, as gross claims against policies from its continuing operations fell by 43 per cent in the first half of 1994. The group does not disclose interim profits, but it emphasised its confidence in the latest recovery by declaring an interim dividend of 0.4p, the first interim payment since 1990. Trade Indemnity has mirrored the strength of the UK economy, because of its broad exposure to business failures. The company said that business failures had dropped by 42 per cent in the first half of this year, and gross claims paid from continuing operations fell by a similar proportion from Pounds 51.4m to Pounds 29.5m. In addition, Trade Indemnity achieved an increase in gross premium income to Pounds 74.4m (Pounds 71.3m), up 4.3 per cent from 1993. Mr Victor Jacob, managing director, said that failures and claims were falling, and while demand for the company's products might be expected to be muted following a recession, it was, in fact, increasing. However, the recent Court of Appeal decision on the Investors' Compensation Scheme, which was underwritten by Trade Indemnity, has resulted in an additional Pounds 7.5m provision against further claims. The Court decision could result in additional claims resulting from bad pensions advice given by failed independent advisers covered by the ICS. The company is planning to appeal. Further negative news came from the company's investment portfolio, which experienced a Pounds 10.6m decline in value during the first half of the year, reflecting the weakness in bond and equity markets. Investment income on its Pounds 100m portfolio fell from Pounds 2.21m to Pounds 1.99m, but as a long-term investor, Trade Indemnity will not be required to make provisions against the portfolio at the year end.</p>

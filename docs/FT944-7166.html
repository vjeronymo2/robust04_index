			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: BIS survey finds sentiment switching to euronotes Difficult conditions for borrowers in the international bond markets have benefited other sectors, such as euronotes and syndicated loans, where issuance has risen sharply this year. According to the Bank of International Settlements' latest quarterly report on financial market trends*, the euronote sector, which includes short and medium-term notes, has seen record volumes of supply. In the first nine months of this year, net issuance under all types of facilities amounted to Dollars 111.3bn, compared with Dollars 47.9bn in the same period of 1993. The bulk of euronote issuance has been through euro medium-term note programmes (EMTN). This enables borrowers to issue debt with varying maturities, currencies and volumes under the same master documentation, and makes them cheaper and more flexible than international or domestic straight bond issues, which require separate documentation for each deal. The bulk of new euronote drawings was denominated in currencies other than US dollars, with borrowers taking advantage of the flexible structure of EMTN programmes to select the currencies offering the highest absorption capacity and best foreign exchange prospects, the report states. In particular, Japanese investors' preference for domestic currency assets prompted the issuance of a heavy volume of yen-denominated paper, which accounted for 38 per cent of total market expansion in the first half, according to the BIS. Meanwhile, the syndicated credits sector, which is predominantly of a floating-rate nature, remained buoyant, with a total of Dollars 59.3bn of new facilities arranged during the third quarter, on top of Dollars 118.3bn in the first two quarters. 'The high volume of loanable funds stimulated competition to win business: the average maturity of loans was increased, spreads charged over inter-bank rates were reduced and covenant clauses were further relaxed,' the BIS reports. Moreover, institutional investors' reluctance to commit funds at fixed interest rates for long periods led an increasing number of lower-rated or lesser-known borrowers to turn to syndicated loan credits to take advantage of easing market conditions. This led some market participants and regulators to caution against the risk of a reversion to the low credit standards which prevailed in the late 1980s. Loan facilities provided to US borrowers continued to reflect merger and acquisition activity there, while various 'jumbo' loans were launched for financing or refinancing purposes. These include the Ecu6bn revolving facility arranged in September for Spain with a spread of only 4.5 basis points above the London inter-bank offered rate (Libor). Outside the OECD, Asian borrowers raised some Dollars 7.7bn through syndicated loans, while new facilities arranged for Latin American entities amounted to Dollars 1.8bn, according to the BIS. *International Banking and Financial Market Developments, by the Bank for International Settlements, Basle.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Israel Police are completing their preparations  for withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and Jericho. Police Minister  Moshe Shahal said today that the Israel Police would evacuate  their personnel within the very next few weeks, rather than the  originally planned four months. Our correspondent 'Ofer Vardi  spoke with the police minister:    [Begin recording] [Vardi] Upon the evacuation and the  redeployment in the Gaza Strip and Jericho, the Israel Police's  Gaza District will be renamed the Shimshon District, Minister  Moshe Shahal announced today in a meeting with journalists in  Tel Aviv. Policemen are busy organizing the said withdrawal  which, according to the police minister, will take effect soon.    [Shahal] Israel Police troops will initially evacuate police  stations and Gaza's central prison, according to the timetable  stipulated by the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]. This timetable  will apparently be shorter than the four months originally  planned. I believe we are now talking about very few weeks.    [Vardi] This fast withdrawal, however, will not change the  Israel Police's plans to reinforce its troops in the territories.    [Shahal] We have started discussing the issue, but the  debate has not yet been concluded. We are mainly dealing with  the second phase, the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho  agreement, which will call for additional troops; we are  requesting an addition of some 1,400 policemen. Our immediate  requirements in order to carry out first phase of evacuating the  police stations in Gaza are: building stations in the Qatif  Bloc, creating a police district near Gaza, integrating police  personnel into the border terminals planned by the IDF, and  reinforcing the border terminals in Rafah and especially at the  Allenby Bridge especially.

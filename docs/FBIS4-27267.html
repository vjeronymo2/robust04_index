			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 1 KYODO -- Japan has confirmed that  North Korea fired a missile into the Sea of Japan, Chief Cabinet  Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai said Wednesday [1 Jun].    "I heard it (the launch of a missile) was true," the top  government spokesman said at a news conference.    But Kumagai declined to comment further, saying the  government has yet to know full details of the incident.    "It looks like it was not the test launch of a ballistic  missile," he said.

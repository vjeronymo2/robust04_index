			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: De Beers to double Akwatia output De Beers is installing a new process at Ghana's Akwatia diamond mine which will soon double its output to 40,000 carats a month as the government prepares to divest from Ghana Consolidated Diamonds (GCD) next year. The new process will treat and recover more diamonds, improve their quality, reduce losses by increasing security and cut the operating costs, according to Mr J Ansafo-Mensah, GCD's managing director. De Beers took over interim management of Ghana's only large-scale diamond mine last October, after Inckel International withdrew from a proposed joint venture with the government and the US gem marketing company Lazare-Kaplan in 1992. Under the new agreement, which has to be approved by Ghana's parliament, GCD will be restructured by September 1995 as a new company in which De Beers and Lazare-Kaplan will each own 40 per cent. The government of Ghana will retain 20 per cent of the assets, and De Beers Central Selling Organisation will take over the marketing of the diamonds from Lazare-Kaplan. When De Beers took over the management last October it increased production from about 10,000 carats a month to 20,000 carats and from about July output is expected to reach 40,000 carats a month. De Beers is reducing the two plants at Akwatia to one and replacing the bore-milling and pan processes with a dense media separation plant which will feed a concentrate into an X-ray sorting machine. The equipment is exclusive to De Beers and is due to begin operating in June on lease to GCD until the new company is formed.</p>

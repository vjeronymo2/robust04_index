			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 9 (KCNA) -- Delegates of political  parties and organizations of different countries, who had  attended the international seminar of revolutionary parties and  organizations held in Brussels, made public a joint statement on  May 4 denouncing the U.S. and its allies' moves to isolate and  stifle Korea and supporting the Korean people's cause of  national reunification.    The statement expressed deep apprehensions of the anti-DPRK  campaign launched by the United States and its followers to  isolate and stifle socialist Korea under the pretext of  fictitious "nuclear suspicion".    It favoured the 10-point programme of the great unity of the  whole nation which indicates a shortcut to Korea's reunification.    It demanded that the United States and its followers  including the International Atomic Energy Agency stop at once  their anti-DPRK, anti-socialist campaign going against the  present trend of the world towards peace and justice.    It urged the South Korean authorities to send Kim In-so and  Ham Se-hwan back to the North at once, set free all prisoners of  conscience and accept the proposal for a convocation of national  conference advanced by the North to achieve Korea's  reunification in the 1990s.    It called upon political parties, organizations and  progressive forces the world over to extend solidarity to the  Workers' Party [WPK] and the people of Korea in their efforts  for the defence of the socialist gains and for the independent  and peaceful reunification of the country and conduct an  international campaign to defend socialist Korea.    Meanwhile, the chairman of the Danish Communist Party (M-L),  the chairman of the Communist Party of Germany, the general  secretary of the All-Union Bolshevik Communist Party, the  chairman of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the chairman of  the Workers World Party of the United States, who attended the  seminar, expressed full support to and solidarity with the WPK  and the Korean people in their efforts for the building of  socialism and the independent and peaceful reunification of the  country, when they met the delegation of the Workers' Party of  Korea.</p>

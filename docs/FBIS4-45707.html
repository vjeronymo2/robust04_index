			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Christa Friedl: "First Road Signs </F> Through the Cleanup Maze"]    [Text] [First para is editor's  summary] VDI-N, Duesseldorf-- Pollution cleanup has reached a  crisis. In many cases there is no suitable procedure, more often  there is a lack of money, but usually the real inhibiting factor  is the lack of clear standards for the evaluation and cleansing  of contaminated soils. The planned Federal soil protection law  is intended to help.    At least in East Germany toxic waste cleanup is not failing  for lack of money: the Union has provided funds of DM1 billion  annually for cleansing the soil of privatized companies over the  next 10 years. There are also billions for toxic waste cleanup  for large-scale chemical firms, for lignite and shipyards.  According to the Federal Environmental Agency in Berlin (UBA) a  total of DM15 billion is available through the end of the 90's.  But experiences in the new Federal Laender show that full  coffers do not necessarily set off cleanup activities: "What is  still missing," explains UBA expert Dr. Karin Freier, "are  uniform bases and standards for investigation, evaluation and  cleanup."    So far toxic waste cleanup has been the business of the  Laender. The result is that the danger from a particular piece  of ground is evaluated in quite different ways. In practice it  is quite routine for toxic waste to be eliminated in one Federal  Land at great expense, while the neighboring Land would hardly  have noticed it. "In Germany we have 16 different methodologies  for toxic waste cleanup," agreed Freier at the Technical  University in Berlin at the end of February.    An investigation of the Hygiene Institute of the Ruhr Area  in  Gelsenkirchen supports this lack of uniformity with some  statistics. It says that so far there are 37 different lists of  toxic materials, and 24 of them contain quite different values  for testing, cleanup and threshold values for certain  pollutants. In addition there are about two dozen different EDP  models for risk evaluation on the market.    Legislators are hving a hard time with regulatory efforts  for  toxic waste cleanup: The Federal Environmental Agency has been  working on Technical Guidelines on Toxic Waste for four  years--so far without results. The draft of the Federal Soil  Protection Law proposed last summer now offers a concrete legal  starting point. Freier says, "For the first time there is the  possibility of establishing unified Federal standards for  dealing with toxic soil changes and toxic wastes."    The alpha and omega of such unified Federal standards are  the  establishment of "use-dependent testing and response," i.e.  threshold values for toxins which both give information about  how great the risk from a polluted piece of ground is and also  determine whether a surface must be cleaned up or not. At a  technical discussion in April experts from the Laender will  discuss the derivation of such values for testing and response.    At what level does a material begin to be harmful to health?  Socalled TRD values (TRD stands for tolerable resorbable dosage  rate in micrograms per kilogram and day) give information about  this question. A TRD value determines the highest level of  absorption at which no deleterious effects on health are to be  expected, or, in the case of carcinogens, at which there is a  low risk of becoming ill. Last year the UBA published TRD values  for 82 materials and groups of materials relevant to toxic  waste. "Still," according to Freier, "there continues to be a  great need for research on toxicological effects." And the  question of how different toxins work in combination is not yet  answerable in most cases. According to the UBA, a research  project now in progress is to produce the first findings on such  combined effects by fall.    Test values also depend essentially on the later use of the  decontaminated area. Thus Dr. Ulrich Ewers of the Hygiene  Instititute of the Ruhr Area distinguishes three groups:  children's playgrounds, residential areas and park facilities on  the one hand, areas in horticultural and agricultural use on the  other, and in addition commercial and industrial areas. The  values suggested by the Institute for residential areas are  twice as high as those for children's playgrounds; the factor  for park and recreational facilities is five, for commercial and  industrial areas 10 (see table).    Objectivity and professionalism are rarities in the public  discussion of toxic waste, but they are the basis on which the  new soil protection law is built. "The goal of the investigation  of dubious areas is not knowledge of the potential for  contamination, but of the potential risk arising from it," as  Karin Freier at the Technical University put it. In other words,  if a soil is contaminated, but the toxins are so tightly bound  that they cannot escape into the air or into the subsoil water,  the dubious area does not necessarily have to be declared a  toxic waste site.    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Recommendation for Establishing Soil Test Values (Data in mg/kg dry soil  |  |weight)

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] The Human Rights Commission [HRC] rapporteur on  Iran, Reynaldo Galindo Pohl, by issuing his report on our  country's human rights record, once again proved that the UN  pursues a policy of double standards and exploits the human  rights issue as a political lever.    From time to time Mr. Galindo Pohl releases a report on the  human rights records in Iran to conclude a phase of his mission.  However, his mission is to keep alive the issue of human rights  violations in Iran by resorting to every possible means. For  this purpose he compiles the false and biased reports of the  Western press, affiliated to international Zionism, and presents  them to the HRC as a report.    Throughout his life Galindo Pohl has witnessed blatant and  gross violation of human rights by U.S. imperialism and its  local agents in his country, Central America. Nevertheless, he  refers to the fatwa of killing Salman Rushdie, the apostate  author of the book The Satanic Verses as violation of  human rights. He mistakes freedom of speech with freedom to  offend and violate sanctities.    Galindo Pohl is alway touring Europe. He should therefore  know better: If anyone, in whatever status, were to attribute  something to a Jewish personality or comment on a historical  issue that does not please the Jews, they would raise their hue  and cry. For instance, some time ago a member of France's  National Front, who fought Hitler's occupation forces and lost  an eye in a battle, said: The German gas chambers were only a  minor part of the history of World War II. The Jews dragged him  to a court on charges of undermining Jewish suffering, and  obtained a verdict against him. Now Mr. Galindo Pohl ignores  insults against the Prophet of a religion representing more than  one fifth of the world population.    In reality, if any organization or state were to be  condemned  for violating human rights, the United States and the Security  Council should be condemned. Since Friday the sixth of Esfand  [25 February], when dozens of worshipers were massacred in the  holy shrine of Ibrahim in Hebron, the Security Council has not  yet made any decision to issue a resolution condemning the  Israeli regime. Even if such a resolution were to be passed, it  would be a waste of ink and paper as it would fail to achieve  anything. So far the HRC has only expressed regret on the  matter, and the U.S. Government's only concern has been the  peace talks. [passage omitted]</p>

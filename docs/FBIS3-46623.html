			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [News conference by unidentified "senior U.S. Government </F> official" at U.S. Embassy in Tokyo following 12-13 October  U.S.-Japan discussions on insurance with unidentified reporters]    [Text] [Reporter] When will the next meeting be held?    [U.S. official] We did not decide at this meeting, but it  will probably be in mid-November.    [Reporter] You stated that quantitative indices will be used  to observe the change in the Japan market. What level do you  think the foreign share in Japan should be?    [U.S. official] The table I just showed you represents the  breadth of foreign shares in the G-7 nations, and it indicates  how apart Japan is from this breadth. We hope that the gaps will  be bridged.    If the points of concern regarding the Japan market, which I  explained today, are adequately solved within the framework of  insurance reform, the logical result is that Japan's insurance  market will approach those of the other G-7 nations.  Specifically, in terms of openness and the competitive aspect,  and with the foreign companies able to display their ability to  offer technical innovations in Japan, Japan will approach the  other advanced nations and, when that is achieved, the figures  themselves will naturally change.    [Reporter] You stated that the United States has no  intention  of indicating specific figures, and that you do not intend to  retaliate although the figures may not be achieved. If the gap  is not bridged and the Japan market does not change despite the  use of other indices, what will happen after that?    [U.S. official] A memo was handed by Ambassador Kantor to  Ambassador Kuriyama concerning the comprehensive framework  agreement, and in it is written that the United States will  reserve the right to use the trade act. The U.S. trade act  includes Article 301 and also Article 1377 concerning the  telecommunications agreement. The trade act also includes a law  called "Title VII" which encompasses government procurement in  the foreign countries. Consequently, if the framework talks do  not progress smoothly, it is clear that the United States will  reserve the right to use the trade act.    However, I believe that the situation will not evolve to  that  point. The reason is that the Insurance Council has issued the  report from various angles, and the content of the U.S. proposal  closely corresponds with the content of the report. Also, the  Hosokawa cabinet is treating the easing of controls as a  priority task and, if so, the insurance issue should also be  included. Therefore, we do not believe at all that the situation  I just described will come to pass, and I believe that we can  achieve great success.    [Reporter] Are you optimistic about expanding the 2-percent  share to a double-digit level? And if you consider a  double-digit level to be desirable, what is your target  timeframe in terms of years?    [U.S. official] We would prefer a triple digit over a double  digit (laughter), but that is unrealistic. We believe that the  present gap should be bridged in broad form from a medium-term  viewpoint. By medium-term is usually meant three or four years  as pointed out by the OECD. However, despite new rules and  regulations, we do not believe that a nation's market can change  overnight.    First, the attitude and behavior within Japan's market must  of course change, and also financial investments and agreements  by the foreign insurers will be necessary. So, in terms of  generally bridging the gaps between Japan and the other G-7  nations, we believe that we can easily adopt a medium-term  viewpoint--that is, expect the gaps to be bridged within three  to four years.    [Reporter] Are you considering the indication of indices in  areas other than the talks on the insurance problem?    [U.S. official] Our purpose is to work together with the  Japanese Government and to agree on a combination of  qualititative and quantitative indices. In measuring the  results, our goal is to achieve them without a trace of  ambiguity. This aspect will be part of the talks to take place  within the next several weeks or months.    Our desire is to agree on these indices between the United  States and Japan. However, if it is unsuccessful, we will  unilaterally formulate qualitative and quantitative indices. The  reason is that it is necessary to measure whether we have  succeeded or whether there have been results, and we would like  of course to proceed jointly with the Japanese Government in an  agreed form. However, if that is not feasible, we will be  compelled to proceed independently.    [Reporter] Is there a basis on which you indicated the  shares  of the foreign companies? Also, the Japan side is protesting the  basis for the calculation of the figures. What was the response  by Japan?    [U.S. official] By foreign insurers, we mean cases where  more  than 50 percent of foreign capital is invested. Some informed  sources say that it is preferable to use OECD figures. However,  in reporting statistics to the OECD, various nations submit them  on the basis of their respective and different definitions.  Therefore, we believe that the OECD statistics lack credibility.    We indicated the figures to the Japanese Government today,  but the Japanese side has not had the opportunity to read them  carefully. We believe that the Japanese Government will probably  review the background sources of the figures and the data. We  also believe that it will eventually understand what the figures  represent. Perhaps a debate on these criteria will take place at  our next meeting. However, we feel extremely comfortable with  the figures. For example, the share in France is indicated as 10  percent, but it is not a major problem whether it is 11 percent  or 9 percent. The problem, after all, is that the gaps between  Japan and the other advanced nations are excessively large, and  that these gaps must absolutely be reduced.    [Reporter] Do these figures cover both life insurance and  nonlife insurance?    [U.S. official] They cover both life and nonlife insurance.  However, the 2 percent for Japan is perhaps too high. The reason  is that the figure for postal insurance is not included. If it  is included, the denominator will be larger and the result will  be less than 2 percent. We are presently requesting data on the  figure that includes postal insurance.</p>

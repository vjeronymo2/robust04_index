			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Minister Valentin Kulychenko by A. </F> Malyenko; place and date not given: "Program Priorities"]    [Text] Preparation of the Ukrainian Program for  Development of the Mining and Metallurgical Complex Up to 2010  has been completed. The PRAVDA UKRAINY editorial office  requested Deputy Minister Valentin Kulychenko to talk about its  principal points and evaluate the situation that is forming in  the branch.    [Malyenko] Valentin Arsenyevich, quite a few programs were  adopted in years past as well, among other things, also  concerning the metallurgical branch. That, however, did not help  avoid the catastrophic drop in production. What will the  adoption of another program accomplish? Is it really necessary  to plan development of enterprises from above? After all, their  directors should know better than anyone how to develop their  own production.    [Kulychenko] This program differs from the preceding ones in  that it is based on new approaches, taking into account the  current state of affairs in the economy. It sets totally  concrete tasks. First of all, it proposes supplying the domestic  market with required products. In that connection, priorities  are determined--out of their total number, individual  enterprises that must be developed on a priority bases are  differentiated.    It is understandable that every director, naturally, would  not prefer to postpone until better times the modernization or  reconstruction of his enterprise. But, it is impossible to  satisfy all of these proposals, or rather demands. There are not  enough funds for this. Also, in the plans everyone intends to  increase production two- to threefold. If that was realized,  then we would be swamped with metal products and there would be  no place to dispose of them.    [Malyenko] But, at the same time, one cannot prohibit some  collective from developing its production.    [Kulychenko] No one is forbidding them to do so. Do that, by  all means, but count only on your own resources. Benefits and  assistance will not be granted to everyone, but only to those  who are performing a priority task.    Otherwise, this is what could happen. In a very severe  economic situation, when the country lacks funds for the  purchase of fuel, medicines, and various essential goods, the  creation of totally unpromising production could start. Here are  some concrete examples.    A mill is under construction at the Donetsk Metallurgical  Plant designed for the production of 600,000 motor vehicle  springs per year. What are they going to do with those springs?  After all, the foreign market does not need them, while  Ukrainian requirements come to only 250,000 springs. But,  despite everything, the director, being a deputy, won  preferential-term financing for that facility.    The same action was taken by the Ilyich Combine in Mariupol  by purchasing and installing two tube-rolling mills. There is no  need for those products, and 7 million dollars were spent on the  purchase of necessary equipment alone. At the present time, the  director of the Yenakiyevo Metallurgical Plant is obtaining  funds to reconstruct one of the rolling mills. The goal appears  to be sound--increased output of reinforced steel and wire rods.  But, the point is that, at the neighboring Makeyevka Plant, such  reconstruction is already being completed and these high-quality  products that meet world standards will be produced there in the  near future. Therefore, it would be wiser to allocate the funds  demanded by Yenakiyevo for other enterprises in accordance with  adopted priorities. This program is called upon to deal  specifically with such cases.    [Malyenko] Still, it would be naive to assume that, with the  adoption of the program, trouble-free vistas are opening up for  the enterprises. It would be good if you could talk frankly  about those things that are not considered in the program, but  without which there can be no real improvement in the economic  situation within the metallurgical branch.    [Kulychenko] Our program is good on the technical plane, and  it worked out with something of a technical tilt. Unfortunately,  however, it was impossible to include all of the current  economic factors in it. This particularly applies to a study of  market conditions. It will be necessary to literally fight for a  share of the markets, at the same time, however, speaking quite  frankly, we are poorly prepared for that.    Serious attention should be focused on the experience of  Western firms, which would never undertake reconstruction  without a skilled business plan. Another thing we could learn  from them is the conduct of reconstruction stage-by-stage,  step-by-step, beginning with whatever will yield profit at the  earliest date. Western specialists, for instance, tell us: You  have good metallurgical production, it is fully competitive, but  the buyer may not like the outside appearance of products, the  packaging. Therefore, someone should probably start not with  radical reconstruction but with the packaging sector, to give  the goods a marketable appearance.    A great deal of money is needed for the successful clearing  up of enterprises and rejuvenation of the branch as a whole. If  technical rearmament relies mainly on funds earned by the  metallurgists themselves, then some budgetary appropriations  will also be required for the resolution of social problems.  This pertains especially to such a painful question as the  retraining and employment services for laid off workers. This  topic, by the way, requires a separate discussion--there are too  many problems involved.    What is extremely important is the creation of conditions to  attract investments in the branch. At present, our unstable  legislation is simply scaring off foreign investors. Their  importance for rejuvenation of production may be judged on the  basis of the following example. As soon as we were given several  trillions of karbovantsy in credits during April, the volume of  production immediately increased by a fourth in the course of  the month, as compared with the first quarter.    The metallurgical branch is capable of satisfying the needs  of the country's national economy while yielding competitive  products. It is merely necessary to remove those obstacles that  are preventing this potential from working to the fullest extent.</p>

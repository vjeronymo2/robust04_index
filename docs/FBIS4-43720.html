			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hermann-Josef Tenhagen: "Kalkar Plutonium to </F> Russia"]    [Text] Berlin -- RWE [Rhine-Westphalian Electric Works] AG  plans finally to get rid of the plutonium-containing remains of  its fast breeder in Kalkar, which has never been put into  operation, by selling it to Russia. A total of 123 Mox fuel  elements consisting of uranium and plutonium, which the  electrical company in Essen once produced for Kalkar, are to be  brought to Beloyarsk. Nikolay Oshankov, chief engineer of the  fast breeder in Beloyarsk in southern Russia, told this  Greenpeace environmentalists. "This was not our initiative, it  came from the German experts."    Negotiations are under way with the responsible RWE  subsidiary Fast Breeder Nuclear Power Plant Company (SBK) and  with Siemens. An RWE spokesman confirmed the contacts:  "However, the talks are not in a decisive stage." There are  also contacts with the operators of the Japanese breeder reactor  in Monju. In addition, the reprocessing and direct final  storage of the fuel elements is also being considered.    At the moment, the fuel elements, which contain 1.2 tonnes  of  plutonium, are still stored in the so-called federal bunker in  Hanau. When it became clear in 1991 that the breeder reactor in  Kalkar would never be put into operation, the RWE subsidiary SBK  (RWE share 67 percent) first tried to bring the fuel elements,  which contain 40 percent of plutonium, to Dounreay in Scotland.  Breeder fuel elements made in Belgium had already been flown to  the Scottish nuclear plant in 1991. According to Greenpeace  information, the SBK even rented storage room in Dounreay for  1.2 million German marks.    But then more and more obstacles emerged for the transport  to  Scotland. Despite existing permits by the Federal Government,  considerable resistance against transporting the plutonium by  plane developed. The Hesse government did not want to tolerate  a flight with 1.2 tonnes of the fiendish stuff aboard from  Frankfurt/Main Airport. And local and land politicians  responsible for Pferdsfeld, the airport in Rhineland-Palatinate,  which should have been used instead, also reacted negatively.    Second, the fuel elements in the federal bunker in Hanau had  been radioactively contaminated during a nuclear accident at  Siemens, which is located in the same building. At first, the  fuel elements were not permitted to be transported in this  contaminated state. However, one could not clean them, either,  because the facility at Siemens has been out of operation since  the 1991 accident.    Now they are supposed to be sent to Beloyarsk. The operators  of the fast breeder there are pleased. Chief Engineer Oshankov  told Greenpeace: "The German side supplies us with the fuel  elements, and we use them in our reactor. And with our  technology we would finally process the used fuel elements  further." The reprocessing is to be done in the ailing nuclear  factory of Mayak near Chelyabinsk in the southern Urals.    Oshankov also affirms that the contracts have not yet been  concluded. The responsibility for potential accidents has not  yet been clarified. In addition, a bit of reconstruction has to  be done in Beloyarsk for the German fuel elements. It is  unclear who is going to pay for the reconstruction. "If we  reprocessed the German fuel elements, we would no longer need  the reconstructed facility afterwards," Oshankov says.    Yesterday Greenpeace said the planned transfer of the  plutonium is completely irresponsible. Fire broke out in the  14-year-old BN-600 breeder reactor in Beloyarsk in October and  May because of leaks in the cooling system. Each time  radioactivity was released. And plutonium for the  Soviet/Russian nuclear weapons program was produced in Mayak  until 1992. In 1957 a nuclear waste container exploded in the  plant. Thousands of square kilometers of land and several  hundreds of thousands of people were contaminated with  radioactive elements.</p>

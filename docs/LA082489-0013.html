			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> GROWTH FEARS PREVAIL IN P.V. ESTATES;  </P> <P> RESIDENTS WIN CHANGES IN PROPOSED HEIGHT, DENSITY STANDARDS  </P> <P> Palos Verdes Estates residents, afraid of overdevelopment and wall-like  business buildings, won height and density concessions Tuesday from the City  Council during a three-hour public hearing on development standards for  commercial and multifamily residential zones.  </P> <P> The relatively small zones are in Malaga Cove, near the Malaga Cove Plaza and  City Hall, and along Palos Verdes Drive West in Lunada Bay. The city has few  vacant lots, so the proposed regulations would apply largely to redevelopment.  </P> <P> Agreeing with opponents, who mustered petitions, letters and an audience of  more than 60 people at the hearing, the council modified height controls --  initially proposed as a blanket reduction from 40 feet to 35 feet -- to ensure  that new structures would be no higher than those they replace. Several  residents who live behind commercial zones said they fear that older structures  built considerably below the permitted height could be replaced with taller  buildings that would block their views.  </P> <P> The council also called for a 1,800-square-foot lot area for each dwelling unit  in the multiple-residential zone. Even though the council said the  1,400-square-foot requirement originally proposed would allow far fewer units  than the existing 349, residents wanted more restrictions on density.  </P> <P> While modifying development controls, the council left intact some proposed  parking provisions -- including a parking area in front of City Hall and use of  a nearby vacant street right of way -- that also drew fire at the hearing. Carl  G. Allen, who lives near City Hall, said there is "no planning basis" for such  proposals. But the council characterized them as concepts that may or may not  be carried out.  </P> <P> Among other proposals are specific off-street parking for businesses, an "in  lieu" fee that would be paid by businesses unable to provide the required  number of parking spaces, and formation of a committee to advise the council on  implementing parking plans. Also proposed is a site review process, similar to  an existing one for homes, to ensure that developments are compatible with  their neighbors.  </P> <P> Officials said the development proposals -- put together over the last year by  the Planning Commission and a subcommittee of council members, staff and  representatives of the Palos Verdes Homes Assn. -- are intended to update  40-year-old regulations and to address matters not covered by the code,  including condominium conversions, screening of mechanical equipment and the  percentage of a commercial lot that a building may cover.  </P> <P> Some critics said the proposals threaten the quality of life for which people  moved to the city, but the council contended that the changes would tighten  development controls rather than relax them. Councilman James Kinney said the  proposals "upgrade ordinances for life in the 1990s. Our existing ordinances  are ill-equipped to do that."  </P> <P> The Planning Commission will consider the changes ordered by the council and  may hold a hearing on them Sept. 19. A moratorium on commercial construction in  Malaga Cove and Lunada Bay will remain in effect until the council takes final  action on development plans.  </P></p>

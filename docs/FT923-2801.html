			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Aim of state pension for all is questioned THE survival of state pensions for all is questioned in a report published yesterday. The study, the first of a series of reports on older people in Britain, says it is no longer the case that all pensioners are poor and a 'state transfer to all pensioners no longer represents a well-targeted benefit'. Private pensions form the greater part of the income of most pensioners. The report says a case can therefore be made for spending most of the state's resources on the poorer minority. The report, by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, a social policy think tank, is part of a wide-ranging examination of issues affecting older people co-ordinated by the Carnegie Inquiry into the third age. The third age is defined as between 50 and 74. The inclusion of people as young as their early 50s has the statistical effect in the institute's study of showing that a high proportion of the youngest third-agers are also the poorest. These are mainly unemployed people in their 50s and early 60s who do not receive higher levels of benefit paid to pensioners. Overall, however, the study finds that income distribution in the third-age group is 'at least as unequal as that in the population as a whole'. The report argues that the basic state pension has fallen in importance because it is indexed to price inflation, while earnings and other sources of income have risen considerably faster. It estimates that if state pensions were indexed to earnings the cost would rise to Pounds 79.7bn a year by the year 2050 - 3 1/2 times the present cost. A second report in the third-age series - a study of employment issues by the Public Finance Foundation, an independent research body - says demographic changes offer older people who want to continue working better prospects in the 1990s than in the 1980s, but not to the extent that is often assumed.

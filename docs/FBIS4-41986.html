			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Kuznechevskiy: "Ukraine: Elections </F> Held, Society Split"]    [Excerpts] It would be no exaggeration to say that the  elections in the Ukraine were followed with much greater  attention abroad than in the republic itself. The results, I  have no hesitation in saying, are being awaited impatiently in  Russia and the United States, Western Europe, and Moldova. But  even 48 hours later the sluggish post-independence state machine  has managed to process the voting forms from only 16 of the 27  electoral districts. Of the votes counted in this partial  context 35 percent of voters preferred L. Kravchuk and 31  percent, L. Kuchma.    Even before the elections the geographical preference  pattern  had been accurately predicted by sociological services: Western  oblasts prefer the current president, while eastern oblasts  prefer the main contender for the post. In practice 90 percent  of Ivanofrankivsk Oblast voters, 80 percent of Lviv Oblast  voters, 76 percent of Rovno Oblast voters, and 71 percent of  Volyn Oblast voters who participated in the election preferred  L. Kravchuk, whereas 82 percent of Crimeans preferred L. Kuchma.  The former premier has twice as many votes as the president in  Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts. [passage omitted]    One of the main conclusions to be drawn is obviously that,  whoever wins on 10 July, he will not be able to ignore the  results of these elections. And the main result is that Ukraine  is split approximately in half. The cold shower which voters in  eastern oblasts have given L. Kravchuk has shown that his  reliance on the national radicals in the west of the country is  leading society into a blind alley. While L. Kuchma, who  advocates Ukraine's integrity, can no longer realize his slogan  in practice unless he finds a common languages with the  population of the western oblasts.    All the indications are that unless these two leaders draw  the appropriate conclusions, the winner at the next elections in  the Ukraine will be not A. Moroz or B. Lanovoy, but a  Belorussian [as published] version of Zhirinovskiy.    Another conclusion also suggests itself. No matter how the  10 July second round of elections ends, it can already be said  that the policy which Leonid Kravchuk has been pursuing since  the fall of 1991 has not brought success, to put it mildly.  Reliance on the superficially highly attractive slogans of the  national radicals in the western oblasts has brought him to  political disaster, since how else can you assess the activity  of a political leader who has split his country?    The initiator, by his own admission, of the destruction of  the Soviet Union in December 1991 in Belovezhskaya Forest, L.  Kravchuk -- following the same logic in his policy -- has split  Ukraine in 1994.    His mistake is that his slogan of absolute independence for  Ukraine misled the masses of so-called ordinary people. This  slogan, based on the fact that Ukraine as part of the USSR  produced 34 percent of the steel, 46 percent of the iron ore, 36  percent of the television sets, 56 percent of the sugar, and so  forth, should have confirmed that Ukraine is a rich state. Yet  this republic was only rich as part of the USSR. Having  destroyed its links with the other republics, this state with a  population of 52 million has experienced a vicious two-year  economic crisis, and all the attributes of state independence  have been reduced to proud words, state flags, a national army  uniform, and suchlike.    To a certain extent it for this reason (disillusionment)  that  the turnout of voters in the Ukrainian capital was so low  (barely above 50 percent).    One way or another all these factors cannot fail to impact  on  the second round of the election. What these results will be,  we will learn 10 July.</p>

			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / VW's big hopes for small car: Kevin Done reports on the German carmaker's efforts to catch up Several thousand Volkswagen dealers from across Europe are converging on a Paris race course in the Bois de Boulogne this week. It is not for a flutter on the horses, however, but for the high pressure launch of the new VW Polo, which the German carmaker hopes its dealers will soon be selling in sufficient numbers to transform VW from an also-ran in west Europe's fiercely competitive small car market into a front-runner. The VW group, which includes Audi, Seat and Skoda, may be Europe's biggest carmaker, but as an individual brand VW is ranked only third behind the Opel make (Vauxhall in the UK) of General Motors and Ford. In the small car segment of the market, VW languished in sixth place with the old Polo last year. As the car bumped along to the end of its life-cycle, its sales dropped by 39.8 per cent to only 186,000, according to Automotive Industry Data, the UK-based analysts. Sales of the market-leading Ford Fiesta were more than double Polo sales at 452,000. VW has a lot of ground to make up. Even though it will have the newest car in the market, it is up against tough opposition with both GM and Fiat having made launches in the past 18 months in the shape of the Opel/Vauxhall Corsa and the Fiat Punto. It is vital for VW to achieve a breakthrough in this segment, where superminis (Fiesta, Corsa, Punto etc) and minis (Fiat Cinquecento, Fiat Panda, Renault Twingo etc) account for 31 per cent of all the new cars sold in Europe. With the new Polo, VW dealers will be able to meet the competition on a more level playing field. Its predecessor was long overdue for replacement having been launched 13 years ago, and VW had never properly met the demands of the market-place. VW's UK import subsidiary maintains that with the old model Polo, it could only cover 29 per cent of the market-place. With the new car it will be able to cover virtually the entire market and offer for the first time a host of features common among rival models, such as five doors, automatic transmission, anti-lock braking, power-assisted steering, driver and passenger airbags, air conditioning, central locking and electric windows. Mr Dieter Dahlhoff, director of marketing for the VW brand, says: 'We want to make the new Polo into a real high volume model and to use it to open doors to new customers.' The group is aiming to increase sales of the Polo to at least 350,000 in 1995. Most of the output will come from VW's Spanish plant at Pamplona with output next year targeted to reach at least 1,040 a day on two shifts with the ability to rise to 1,200 a day. The car will be built at VW's main plant at Wolfsburg at the rate of 530 a day. While ambitious for Volkswagen, these targets appear modest against the aims of its bitter rival General Motors, with which it is still locked in controversy over GM allegations of industrial espionage. Opel is raising Corsa production at its Eisenach plant in eastern Germany to 640 a day on a three-shift operation. Combined with its main Corsa plant at Zaragoza, Spain, this will raise total production for the range to 2,400 a day. The Polo must also help to bring VW down to a lower cost base, so that the heavily loss-making German group can start to rid itself of its unenviable position as Europe's high-cost carmaker. Mr Ferdinand Piech, chairman of the VW management board, claims the hours taken to build the new Polo have been cut by about 15 per cent (on a comparable basis to the old Polo) to 16 hours per car. The new car is also an important element in the group's platform strategy aimed at cutting costs and simplifying its global manufacturing activities. It is planning to reduce the number of basic chassis platforms from 16 earlier this year to four by early next decade. The Polo platform will spawn all other small car models in the VW group for the next decade, including Seat and Skoda. According to Mr Ulrich Seiffert, VW group research and development director, the new Polo shares about 40 per cent of its components, by value, with its half-sister, the Seat Ibiza, launched early last year. The Ibiza and the Polo share dashboards, as well as rear axle and suspension, and some engines and gearboxes. VW is developing its first mini car, smaller than the Polo, code-named the EA420 and due for launch in Europe by late 1996. Based on a shortened Polo platform and to be produced at Wolfsburg, it is supposed to be the car that proves VW can assemble cars in Germany as cost effectively as any carmaker in Europe. It is a big task for a small car, but such rationalisation is crucial as the VW group seeks to claw its way back into the black following last year's record losses of DM1.9bn.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- New VW Polo entres a fiercely competitive market  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Car market segments in West Europe 1993  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Basic cars (Fiat 500 &amp; Panda, Renault Twingo etc.)                           5.1%  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Small cars (Ford Fiesta, Opel/Vauxhall Corsa, Fiat Punto etc.)              25.9%  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Lower medium cars (VW Golf, Opel/Vauxhall Astra, Ford Escort etc.)                 33.6%  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Upper medium cars (Ford Mondeo, Opel Vectra/Vauxhall Cavalier etc.)                18.3%  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Executive cars (BMW 3/5 series, Volvo 800, Opel/Vauxhall Omega etc.)            10.5%  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Others (Luxury, sports cars and coupes, sports/utility, MPVs)            6.6%  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Total market                                                   11.428m  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Small car market shares in West Europe 1993  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Total market                    2,949,300          100% Ford Fiesta                       452,409         15.3% Renault Clio                      441,483         15.0% Fiat Uno/Punto                    400,554         13.6% Opel/Vauxhall Corsa               352,693         12.0% Peugeot 106                       272,547          9.2% VW Polo                           186,377          6.3% Citroen AX                        161,127          5.5% Nissan Micra                      135,379          4.6% Seat Ibiza/Cordoba                131,272          4.5% Peugeot 205                       129,089          4.4% Others                                  -          9.6%  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Automotive Industry Data  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

Funds awarded will be used to: (1) Plan and develop model educational predoctoral, faculty development and graduate medical education programs in family medicine which will meet the requirements of section 747(a), by the end of the project period of section 747(b) support; and (2) support academic and clinical activities relevant to the field of family medicine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The program may also assist schools to strengthen the administrative base and structure that is responsible for the planning, direction, organization, coordination, and evaluation of all undergraduate and graduate family medicine activities. Funds are to complement rather than duplicate programmatic activities for actual operation of family medicine training programs under section 747(a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Statutory General Funding Preference  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As provided in section 791(a) of the PHS Act, preference will be given to any qualified applicant that_  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) has a high rate for placing graduates in practice settings having the principal focus of serving residents of medically underserved communities; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) during the 2-year period preceding the fiscal year for which an award is sought, has achieved a significant increase in the rate of placing graduates in such settings.

Several comments were received during the 30-day comment period from one respondent regarding the statutory funding preferences, which are established by law and the established funding priorities for which comments were not requested. The respondent also expressed concern with the proposed funding priority. The respondent suggests that we focus more on the results than activities. These comments will be given serious consideration in the development of funding priorities in future cycles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the final minimum percentages for ``high rate'' and ``significant increase in the rate'' and final funding priority for this program will be retained as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Final Minimum Percentages for ``High Rate'' and ``Significant Increase in the Rate''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ``High rate'' means that 20 percent of all graduates of the medical school in 1989 or 1990, whichever is greater, are spending at least 50 percent of their work time in clinical practice in the specified settings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

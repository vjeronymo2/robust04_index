The Tigre People's Liberation Front, which launched a new  offensive in late August, said the talks will begin in Rome next Saturday and  be observed by representatives of the Italian government. The Tigrean rebels  pushed the government out of Tigre province in February. Last week, the  insurgents claimed to have captured the town of Mekane Selam, 100 miles north  of the capital of Addis Ababa. The government is also scheduled to resume peace  talks with another rebel group, the Eritrean People's Liberation Front, next  month in Nairobi, Kenya.  </P></p>

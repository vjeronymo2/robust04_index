			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ajay Bharadwaj: "Blood Donors Spread AIDS in </F> Punjab"]    [Text] Amritsar, February 23 -- Bhiru has a family of five  with whom he lives in a shabby corner of the railway platform  here. Four years ago, he came here from Bihar looking for work.  To begin with, he tried doing menial jobs which, being a drug  addict, he found too difficult.    He then took to begging, until he stumbled down the more  lucrative profession of selling blood. He says an agent from a  private blood bank offered him Rs 40 for a bottle. From then, he  has been a "regular blood donor," his only means of livelihood.    There are more than 150 such Bhirus in the city, inhabiting  public parks, railway platforms and busstands, who sell their  blood to eke out a living. The dealers have identified them  according to their blood groups and whenever they need a  particular blood type, the professional donors are summoned.    In the absence of adequate government facilities, private  blood banks and nursing homes pay their donors about Rs 50 to Rs  70 for a unit, the charge between Rs 400 and Rs 700 from  patient. The price shoots up if it is a scarce group like "O"  negative.    However, what is causing concern are the impurities and  diseases transmitted through the blood, since the donors live in  unhygienic conditions.    A recent case, in which a patient acquired the AIDS virus  after getting transfusion at a private hospital here, is  considered to be the tip of the iceberg. The patient had tested  HIV negative when he was admitted.    Doctors do not discount the possibility that many more  similar cases may have gone unnoticed, the patient falling prey  to an un-related disease many years later.    According to the health authorities, of the 54 AIDS cases  detected in the city so far, 17 are believed to have been  acquired through blood transfusion.    Private blood banks are loathe to conduct the mandatory  tests  as they would cost about Rs 350 per donor. But in the absence of  such checks, diseases like malaria, hepatitis and AIDS can get  through.    Amritsar is the only city in the state where licences have  been issued to private blood banks, and a move is afoot to  cancel them. But the owners have obtained stay orders from the  court and thus the business continues.    Though there are three licenced dealers in the city, they  have opened retail outlets near all the prominent government  hospitals. These were sealed by the authorities last week after  an AIDS case was detected there.    In nursing homes, too, blood banks are operating illegally.  Relatives or friends of patients are made to donate blood with  the nursing home keeping a part of it as their commission.    The condition of the government-run blood banks, too, is far  from satisfactory as there are hardly any regular donors or  storage facilities.</p>

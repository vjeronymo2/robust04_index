			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Marina Pavlova-Silvanskaya: "Up and Down"] </F>   [Text] The Russian troika-bird has in recent months been  thoroughly jolted in the foreign policy pits and potholes: now  the ephemeral Sarajevo triumph, now the NATO bombardment. The  favorite of diplomatic fortune, Vitaliy Churkin, having in a fit  of temper deafeningly slammed the door, had only just vowed, it  would seem, henceforward no more assistance for the  cheaters--the Bosnian Serbs--and called once again for a march  in single formation with the West before Andrey Kozyrev and  Vyacheslav Kostikov hastened without delay to clarify the  emotional statements of the Russian special emissary.... Hardly  had the connoisseurs of world politics (even the venerable wolf  Georgiy Arbatov) heralded in unison the start of a new cold war  before Boris Yeltsin, following a night-time telephone  conversation with the American President, was hastening to  reassure us: There has not been nor is there any crack in the  relations of the two countries. Up and down, up and down.    The reason for the present "rough air" in Russian diplomacy  is, in my view, the fact that some of the interests it is  defending are irrational and that it is operating as yet, what  is more, according to the "one down, two to carry" principle.  This ailment is not new. Around the end of 1989 or the start of  1990 I, totally confused by the unintelligible foreign policy  vocabulary, inquired of one of its creators: "How is the fact  that the Warsaw Pact is changing from a military-political into  a political-military organization to be understood?" "It is  not," came the response. It is merely a signal that we are not  to be feared." Simply a signal....  <H5>  Serbia Passions </H5>   It is hard to find a reasonable explanation or justification  for the fact that in some parts of the world, where Russia's  real interests are weak, Muscovite diplomacy is demonstrating  effervescent activity, in others, on the other hand, where for  the sake of the cause dispatch should be shown, an Oblomov-like  unruffled composure reigns. Let us take the most burning  example--Serbia. Historical ties to it had been erased almost  completely in the national Russian memory. Throughout the period  between the two world wars, particularly following the rupture  of relations in 1948, Yugoslavia was de facto on the periphery  of Soviet foreign policy interests. In 1981 the world was in a  state of agitation as to whether Soviet troops would be entering  a Poland infected by the rebellious spirit of Solidarity.  Several years later there was anxious conjecture as to how the  Kremlin would react to Budapest's statements of its desire for  the disbandment of the Warsaw Pact. An invasion of Soviet tanks  was never a serious threat to Yugoslavia, on the other hand, it  was considered self-supporting. Its image in Soviet public  opinion of the 1960's-1970's remained more symbolic than real:  The supporters of a reform of real socialism wanted to see it as  the embodiment of the open society and profound transformations,  democracy, and prosperity, for the dogmatists, on the other  hand, it embodied the betrayal of the socialist idea. Not  just Yugoslavia but also other countries, with which we were  linked far more closely in both the economic and  military-political respects, Poland or Czechoslovakia, for  example, were seen by the majority in the same symbolically  simplistic manner, come to that. But in time Warsaw, Prague,  Budapest receded into the background, into the "gray zone" of  Russian interests. The people's orators are not making a clamor  even about Bulgaria, Slav, Orthodox, and bound to Russia by  historical ties, which currently seems particularly important to  some people, nor are the Cossacks straining to go there. Around  Yugoslavia, however, which has plunged into the tailspin of an  endless bloody war, in which neither the just nor the guilty can  any longer be discerned, truly unheard-of passions are raging in  Muscovy.    It is possible that these passions are so tumultuous for  precisely the reason that they have merely a conditional bearing  on their subject. Both the communists and the nationalists are  pursuing in the new Yugoslavia their own, clearly expressed  political interest: Mixing truth with invention, they are  stylizing Serbia as the victim of a world conspiracy  (imperialist and/or Yid-Masonic, Muslim--these are details  according to taste) which has led to the disintegration of a  formerly unified multinational state. How everything occurred in  actual fact plays exactly no part at all. This is convincingly  shown by both the confidences of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, rare in  their ignorance, and the response to them of his supporters.  They are seeking merely transparent parallels to first  emotionally transfer Soviet-Russian reality to Serbia and then  "accept the justice of it." And, of course, to bring it back to  Russia--in the shape, for example, of "Karadzic's red folder,"  with which the Duma members are about to be gladdened by their  colleague Marychev.  <H5>  After the Third Call </H5>   Unfortunately, the main motif of the highly active Russian  diplomacy in Bosnia also is not so much protection of the  peaceful population and an end to the fratricide as, primarily,  the self-assertion of Russia as a great power and emphasis of  the range of its global interests. What was perfectly obvious  previously also was confirmed once again by the comment that  fell from Churkin's lips as regards the fact that Russia is not  one of your banana republics. When, in the wake of our  diplomacy's notorious Sarajevo triumph, the Bosnian Serb  aircraft were shot down, this should have served as the "first  call" for a conceptualization of the Balkan actions. But two  more, loud and resonant, were required: the NATO bombing and  Churkin's clash with the Bosnian Serbs over Gorazde, for the  Foreign Ministry to take a time-out, and for the news media to  pour cold water on Russian diplomacy. Perhaps this will bring it  back to the soil of rationality. Although the coming Duma debate  on Bosnia--against the background of the struggle for the  signing of the Social Accord Treaty--is not all that reassuring  in this respect.    The question, however, is how this rationality is to be  understood and what sort of practical steps ensue from it. It is  possible to swing to the opposite extreme and argue: Since  Russia has at this time no priority national interests in the  former Yugoslavia, it should pull out the peacekeeping  formations from there--and the sooner, the better. Since there  is nothing there by which we may "profit," let us at least make  a show of our pacifism.    It is somehow awkward even inquiring: Is it merely a  question  of the fact that Slavs and Orthodox are dying in Bosnia? The war  is carrying away human lives and crippling people's  futures. And it is for this reason, not on account of some  ideological chimeras or sovereign-power considerations, that  Russia should not, of course, abandon its efforts for an end to  the war in Bosnia. Whether they require the presence of Russian  "blue helmets" or not, how long the presence of Russian soldiers  is needed there and on what terms--this derives from the main  thing: concerted actions with other countries of the world  community attempting to untie the Bosnian knot. Doing this is  hard enough as it is, but if, in addition, Russian great-power  ambitions come to be interwoven in it, this knot altogether  could not fail to become Gordian.    An end to the fratricide in the former Yugoslavia is  undoubtedly in our interests. Not, moreover, irrational and  "perverted" but entirely real--both general and palpable,  material--inasmuch as we could in peacetime trade and cooperate  without regard to blood and soil--with advantage and in the open  (not as now, in secret, under the cover of "third countries").  <H5>  `Russia in a Crowd' </H5>   But let us take another problem--the absence for Russia of  allies outside of the CIS. Each in its own way, but almost all  political forces of the country--particularly in connection with  the prospect of the expansion of NATO and the Partnership for  Peace program--are speaking about the threat of strategic  isolation and about a Black Sea-Baltic cordon sanitaire  allegedly threatening to cut Russia off from Europe. This  question requires action and serious decisions, but what is not  there is not there.    Truly, the USSR's former Warsaw Pact allies and the Baltic  countries are reorienting at full speed toward the West. Fear of  Russia, even if deliberately stoked by politicians, has  nonetheless become a phenomenon of the mass mentality, which it  would be impermissible simply to brush aside. It is at times so  deeply rooted in the national memory that it cannot be simply  rationalized just like that, overnight. An example is Poland,  which was divided three times, by Russia and Prussia included,  and a fourth time by the USSR and Germany, which subsequently  swallowed up its eastern neighbor also. The Poles hated and  feared the Germans no less than the Russians. But in recent  years--and not only on account of the Deutsche mark but mainly  owing to the perseverance of the German Government and the  public--the picture has begun to change.    And Russia? Infrequent and unsuccessful, inadequately  prepared visits. Proposals not meeting with a response in  society, the absence not only of a formulated policy but even of  a real desire to formulate it. And, most important--a dialogue  with the United States or Germany over the heads of the small  Central European or Baltic countries, to whom their ridiculously  insignificant place in world politics is without compunction  pointed out at every available opportunity.    I quote Andranik Migranyan, a member of the Presidential  Council: "...we can no longer be first in line at NATO's doors.  These doors are already surrounded by Romanians, Estonians,  Slovaks, and Czechs. Ukrainians, Latvians, and Lithuanians are  straining to get there also. It would be amusing to see what  Russia, militarily still a superpower, would look like in such a  crowd, where everyone is shouting about the threat emanating  from Russia and for this reason wishes to lean against the  powerful shoulder of NATO in the search for a guarantee of his  territorial integrity and security.... Russia could hardly be  the same type of candidate as, for example, Estonia and Poland,  and Russia would hardly have the same commitments to the world  community as the countries that have today swarmed all over  NATO's doors." Justifying to a group of German and other West  European politicians and scholars Russia's desire to obtain  special status in the Partnership recently, Duma deputy  Vyacheslav Nikonov (Party of Russian Unity and Accord) returned  several times to one and the same purely hypothetical situation,  which was, he believed, to have demonstrated the absurdity of  the desire to put vast Russia on a par with some small country:  "NATO decides, say, to stage exercises of a peacekeeping force  in Abkhazia. When the decision is being made, what, would the  vote of Iceland, merely because the latter is a full member of  NATO, outweigh that of Russia?"  <H5>  In the Language of Prince Gorchakov </H5>   A preoccupation with the dimensions of Russia and a  reluctance to evaluate them anew and find some basis for  dialogue with the Central European and Baltic countries are  irrational and lead, therefore, to an impasse. This, in fact, is  the result at which Migranyan also arrives: "The analysts who  say that in not having affiliated with the Partnership for Peace  program and, subsequently, NATO also we would be condemning  ourselves to strategic isolation are absolutely right. But it is  just as correct also that in having consented to participate in  the Partnership for Peace program with the preservation of the  NATO bloc, which would decide who could become a full member of  the bloc and when and how, we would find ourselves isolated."  There is no solution, apparently, other than a cold war, for  from the flight of the sovereign-power bird only NATO and Russia  are visible. The rest are not worthy of attention, a trifle  thronging around doors and deserving, at best, cross-guarantees.  It would be more correct to call such a position not isolation  but self-isolation, and self-isolation on account of inordinate  great-power arrogance.  <H5>  Are We Condemned to a New Version of the Cold War? </H5>   In American policy in respect to Russia also elements of  irrationality are quite strong: Not all that comprehending of  our chaos, the Americans, in defiance of their own rules, are  oriented not so much toward structures as toward persons whom  they consider influential. One Russian analyst recently even  devoted an unusual article to the "Chernomyrdin phenomenon" and  to his possible influence on the process of the adoption in the  United States of decisions concerning Russia. With this approach  the cooling in Russian-American relations, which is pronounced  even now, could result in an abrupt and swift deterioration and  breakdown.    This has not yet happened, and the slide toward a new  version  of the cold war is not a fatal necessity which cannot be  avoided. But a mutual misunderstanding between Russian and  European (both West and Central European) politicians and  political scientists is growing increasingly distinctly. Some  are speaking increasingly often in the language of the  geopolitics of the start of the 20th century and even Prince  Gorchakov, others, in the language of international law. But  even in recognizing strength they refer primarily to economic  strength. Irrationality, unpredictability, fraudulent  signals--these are the anti-values of the European diplomacy of  our day, that which could merely repel the Old World from us.  Russia is facing one of the most critical foreign policy  decisions in its history. At a fork in the road.</p>

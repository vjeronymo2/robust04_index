			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: KERN COUNTY DROPS ANIMAL CRUELTY CASE  </P> <P> Kern County prosecutors on Thursday declined to file animal cruelty charges  against a former San Fernando Valley woman who faces trial in Los Angeles on  charges that she duped pet owners into giving away dogs and cats that were  later sold to medical laboratories.  </P> <P> Kern County Dist. Atty.  </P> <P> Ed Jagels said authorities believed Barbara Ann Ruggiero, 27, ran a similar  enterprise in Bakersfield but decided not to file charges because she already  faces six years in prison, the maximum sentence allowed under state law for  nonviolent felonies, if convicted in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Ruggiero, whose trial is scheduled to begin Nov. 13 in San Fernando Superior  Court, faces two misdemeanor and 13 felony counts of theft and conspiracy. Even  if convicted in Bakersfield on similar charges, Ruggiero could not receive  additional prison time because it would exceed the state sentencing limit,  Jagels said.  </P> <P> Animal control officers from Kern and Los Angeles counties on Monday raided a  kennel Ruggiero operated in Bakersfield called the Puppy Pavilion and  confiscated 80 dogs, which will remain in protective custody. Officers said the  animals were held in substandard conditions.  </P> <P> Jagels said Kern County prosecutors reserve the right to file charges against  Ruggiero if she is acquitted in Los Angeles.  </P></p>

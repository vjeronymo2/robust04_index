			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Japan's trade surplus up 15.5% Japan's trade surplus jumped 15.5 per cent from a year earlier in November to Dollars 8.55bn, but officials and economists said yesterday they still foresaw a slow decline next year. Strong exports to recovering economies in the US and Europe caused the surplus to rise for the first time since July this year. Exports as a whole climbed 21.1 per cent from a year earlier to Dollars 34.42bn. The politically sensitive surplus with the US, Japan's biggest trading partner, expanded to Dollars 5.17bn from Dollars 4.29bn. But a Ministry of Finance official told reporters: 'The trade surplus is still in a shrinking trend despite November's rise.' He noted that imports continued growing at a double-digit pace, up 23.1 per cent to Dollars 25.86bn.</p>

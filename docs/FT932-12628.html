			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Hoechst finds itself back under media spotlight: Spillages may force the company to tighten procedures LAST Sunday morning a bright yellow cloud drifted out over the western Frankfurt suburb of Hoechst. Around tea-time, the fire-brigade was summoned to douse a leaking rail tanker in Offenbach, east of the city. Later that night, Hoechst, Germany's biggest chemicals concern, was back in the television news headlines. The weekend's events were the latest to damage a campaign being waged by Germany's chemical companies to persuade Bonn to reduce environmental requirements, costing the industry DM6bn (Dollars 3.79bn) and Hoechst DM1.6bn a year. Recent events make it likely they will instead have to pay more to restore confidence. Hoechst has repeatedly promised tighter controls, but there have been 15 accidents at Hoechst since the release two months ago of a 10-tonne toxic cocktail into the Main valley atmosphere. On that occasion 40 people were given medical treatment, dogs were provided with protective boots, children were ordered indoors and topsoil from gardens and allotments was carted away for safe disposal. By contrast, the Sunday morning cloud, resulting from a blast of 50kg of paint and plastics pigment released through a rip in a pump filter sack, had been speedily checked and pronounced harmless. A few dozen local residents were issued with vouchers entitling them to have their cars cleaned at the company's expense. In the Offenbach incident, it turned out, a 'few grams' of sulphur dioxide had dribbled into the air 'probably' through a faulty seal. There was no danger to people or the environment, the fire brigade announced. In normal circumstances the weekend's events might be classed as routine, even unremarkable; Hoechst admits to recording up to 100 'minor' occurrences every year within its complexes. But the company's defensive and disorganised reaction to the incident at Griesheim which started the current series, and a death and a serious injury in a later accident, have generated an atmosphere charged with mistrust and bitterness which has damaged the public standing and reputation of the whole of Germany's Dollars 100bn chemicals industry. Earlier this month, Mr Joschka Fischer, the regional environmental minister, after conferring with Mr Klaus Topfer, his federal counterpart, invoked for the first time a federal law which will subject Hoechst's environmental and security standards and management to intensive independent scrutiny. Failings can be punished by the withdrawal of the company's right to continue operating plant considered unreliable. Mr Wolfgang Hilger, chairman of Hoechst, who is also president of the VCI chemicals industry association, has offered fulsome apologies but so far resisted calls that he should offer his or other board members' resignations. The only role changes likely in the immediate future will be made among the 900 security staff employed at the main plant in Hoechst. The full board has assumed joint responsibility for security and environmental matters, previously the job of Mr Karl Holoubek, and set about reviewing and revising what Mr Hilger insists is a 'state of the art' security system, and which he claims is not being operated properly at works level. 'We simply cannot allow our highly complicated and expensive plant, which is risky both for employees and local people, to be operated by careless people,' he said in an interview this week. Nor, he added, must the workforce be allowed to lose confidence and become even more careless because of a series of mishaps. 'When there are a couple of bus accidents, all bus drivers become nervous - and that can lead to mistakes,' he added. According to preliminary findings, many of Hoechst's recent accidents have stemmed from sources which may be attributed to careless or relaxed application of management's vaunted state of the art rules and systems: blocked pipes, faulty seals, torn filters, damage caused by construction workers, overflows caused by heating compounds in unsealed containers. A loose screw was reportedly to blame for an explosion on March 15 which killed one man and severely injured another. 'There are people who are by their nature less careful than others. We must find out who they are and educate them better or entrust them with other jobs,' Mr Hilger said. Environment minister Fischer will probably have similar thoughts as he proceeds with his own top-level investigations.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] The fast breeder reactor at Creys-Malville (Isere),  which has been transformed by the government into a simple tool  for research and experimentation, could be restarted this summer  to operate for the first few months at low power levels. A new  page has been turned with this decision (LE MONDE 24 February).  The public authorities have made a clearly nonprofit-oriented  choice regarding the fate of this installation costing 27.7  billion French francs [Fr] supporting the recommendations made  in mid-January by DSIN (Nuclear Installations Safety  Directorate), for whom power production at Superphenix was no  longer a priority.    The industrial logic has thus given way to research  programs.  As the Hotel Matignon communique explained it, EDF (France's  Electric Power Co) "will have no authority over Superphenix'  operating power levels," but states that CEA (Atomic Energy  Commissariat), a purely research organization, will henceforth  enter the game with EDF and NERSA (Nuclear Energy Association),  which is responsible for the plant's operation.    Thus, Superphenix will operate in stages to adapt to a  research program that is to be proposed by a supervisory  committee combining NERSA, EDF, and CEA, one or two months from  now. This program, evaluated by Robert Dautray, high  commissioner for atomic energy, and Claude Detraz, director of  CNRS' (National Center for Science and Research) National  Institute for Subatomic Physics, will be monitored by a  scientific committee, which will issue a yearly report on the  experiment conducted.    For Gerard Longuet, minister of Industry, Posts,  Telecommunications and Foreign Trade, and for Francois Fillon,  minister of Higher Education and Research, this program should  permit "the preservation of our (France's) lead in the fast  breeder field," and determine the ability of this way "to  generate power while managing the plutonium produced, and  burning up nuclear waste over the long term." Are these also the  choices of EDF's partners within NERSA, Germany's SBK (Fast  Breeder Power Plant Co) and Italy's ENEL (Italy's Nuclear  Electric Power Co). The government, while awaiting the answers,  is saying that they "(should) accept their responsibility and  pay the costs." In fact, there are some people who are not  opposed to reviewing the levels of participation of SBK or ENEL,  or, if worse comes to worse, seeing one of them drop out of the  project altogether. Everyone knows that abandoning the reactor  could cost Fr8-12 billion, and that litigation on this point  with France's partners could raise this to 18 billion.</p>

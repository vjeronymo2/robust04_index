			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading THE REDUCTION of interest rates in several European countries led to good buying in the derivatives, sending the futures contract sharply ahead and boosting volume in traded options, writes Joel Kibazo. The first trade in the June FT-SE 100 future contract was struck at 2,851 and buying said to have come from NatWest Securities and UBS drove it forward in the first hour. A slight lull then followed before the surprise announcement of a cut in the Bundesbank's 14-day 'repo' rates once again propelled it forward. The interest rate reductions in the Netherlands and Belgium in the afternoon only served to increase demand, which eventually led to a slight squeeze. The day's high of 2,880 was reached just before the market close at around 4pm, and following some profit-taking June ended at 2,877, up 33 from the previous close and some 11 points above its fair value premium to cash of about 5. Turnover was 11,306 lots. Volume in traded options rose to a hefty 40,729 contracts. Dealings in the FT-SE 100 option were particularly heavy, reaching 15,160 lots, but that in the Euro FT-SE option was a modest 2,668. Glaxo was the busiest stock option with 3,833 trades, followed by J. Sainsbury at 2,188. Dealings began in seven new stock options: Royal Insurance and NatWest were particularly well received, trading 1,886 and 1,403 respectively.</p>

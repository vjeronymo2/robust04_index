			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> SENATE VOTES TO LET FEDERAL AGENTS TAKE PART IN POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS  </P> <P> The Senate voted Tuesday to allow IRS, CIA and FBI agents to participate in  political campaigns, rejecting Republican attempts to maintain the status quo  established in the 51-year-old Hatch Act.  </P> <P> On a 51-46 vote, the Senate rejected an amendment to exclude employees in the  spy and tax agencies plus the Justice Department and the Federal Election  Commission from a Democratic bill that removes most current restrictions on  political activities by civil service and postal workers.  </P> <P> The amendment by Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) was one of three  unsuccessful attempts Tuesday by Republicans to chip away at the union-sought  revisions in the Hatch Act.  </P> <P> Dole contended that the entire bill amounts to a "pot of gold" for the  Democratic Party because unionized public employees and their political action  committees overwhelmingly favor Democrats.  </P> <P> Also defeated were GOP amendments to maintain a ban on federal workers holding  office in the two political parties and delaying any changes in the Hatch law  until after a campaign finance reform bill is enacted.  </P> <P> Dole has hinted that Republicans might try to attach major elements of their  proposed campaign finance reform bill -- such as a total abolition of PACs --  to the Hatch Act revisions later this week.  </P> <P> The Hatch law now prohibits the nation's 3 million federal civil service and  postal workers from participating actively in politics. The Democratic bill  would lift some restrictions so that federal employees could hold party offices  and solicit campaign funds from their co-workers, but not from the general  public.  </P></p>

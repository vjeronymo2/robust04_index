The petition was assigned Docket No. PRM&hyph;50&hyph;60 on January 19, 1994. The petitioner requests that the Commission amend its emergency preparedness requirements to change the frequency with which each licensee conducts independent reviews of its emergency preparedness program from annually to biennially. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Submit comments June 27, 1994.

The petitioner states that, if warranted by performance, the resources previously dedicated to the conduct of mandatory audits in this area could now be more effectively used to address performance issues of safety significance. The petitioner indicates that audit functions concerning emergency preparedness would in turn become more performance-based rather than schedule-driven according to the present annual requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The petitioner notes that this request is consistent with the recommendation of the NRC Regulatory Review Group Summary and Overview Report (August 31, 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Grounds for Request  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The petitioner states that the changes requested are identified as present requirements which are resource intensive but of marginal importance to safety. The petitioner offers the following reasons for the request. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1. The underlying purpose of the existing rule is to ensure the continued emergency preparedness program effectiveness in taking the required actions necessary to provide for the health and safety of the public in the event of plant emergencies. This can be readily attained by a more performance-based approach to emergency preparedness overview. The frequency of audits need not be set on an annual basis if performance warrants a different frequency. The proposed rule provides for a nominal frequency of 24 months based on existing performance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Industry performance to date indicates excellent implementation and effective emergency preparedness programs. Industry-wide SALP ratings for emergency preparedness have improved from an average of 2.29 in 1980 to 1.26 in 1992. A two-year audit schedule would permit the licensee an increased degree of flexibility to concentrate available audit resources in areas of observed weakness based on performance rather than conducting a mandatory annual audit of marginal safety significance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The existing requirement to conduct an annual audit is not of itself necessary to achieve the underlying purpose of 10 CFR 50.54(t). Performance-based overview with a two-year maximum interval is sufficient and the proposed rule does not preclude an increased audit frequency if performance warrants. Based on the existing performance within the industry, biennial audits represent an acceptable minimum frequency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

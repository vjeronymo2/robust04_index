			<p><P> July 11, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> FORD, JAPANESE SALES RATES CLIMB; GM, CHRYSLER LOSE  </P> <P> General Motors Corp.'s auto market share woes continued in the first half of  1989 and Chrysler Corp.'s effort stalled, but Ford Motor Co. added more gains  to its stake, statistics from the companies show.  </P> <P> Sales figures for the year to date also reflected market share gains by  Japanese auto makers Honda Motor Co., Toyota Motor Co., and Nissan Motor Corp.  European auto makers, however, continued to show a diminished presence with  only Volkswagen AG holding more than a 1% share.  </P> <P> Total sales of all vehicles were 7.67 million in the first half, down 6.6% from  8.21 million a year ago.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Market Shares Slide  </P> <P> Two of the major U.S. companies saw their market shares slide by more than a  full point in the first half of the year.  </P> <P> GM, the largest U.S. auto maker, saw its first-half share of the market drop to  36% from 37.2% last year, despite concerted efforts by the company to reverse  its slide. GM as recently as 1984 held a 46% share of U.S. auto sales.  </P> <P> Chrysler's share dropped to 10.7% from 11.7% last year. The drop was due in  part to an unfavorable mix of products at the start of the year, when Chrysler  discontinued a number of aging models, and limited availability of its new  Dodge Spirit and Plymouth Acclaim mid-sized cars.  </P> <P> Ford was the only market share gainer among U.S.-based companies in the first  half. Its auto market share rose to 22.7% from 21.9%, a continuation of its  growth from a low of 16% in 1982.  </P> <P> Among Japanese companies, Honda's share grew to 7.5% from 6.7% a year ago, due  both to improved sales of imported models and a sales gain by the Honda Civic,  now built at Marysville, Ohio.  </P> <P> Toyota, which last year opened a new plant in Georgetown, Ky., ended the first  half with a 6.1% market share, up from 5.3% a year ago. Strong sales of the  Nissan Maxima helped Nissan's share of the market climb to 5.2% from 4.3% last  year.  </P> <P> European companies barely made a dent in the market. VW's share was 1.4%, down  from 1.7% a year ago, while Swedish automaker Volvo saw its share grow slightly  to 1% from 0.9% last year.  </P></p>

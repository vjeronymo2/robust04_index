			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: WEST HOLLYWOOD;  </P> <P> FUND-RAISER FOR SHELTER  </P> <P> Rita Coolidge, Monty Hall and Ally Sheedy are expected to be among the guests  at a fund-raiser to support the West Hollywood Homeless Organization at the  Schindler House at 835 Kings Road from 6 to 8 p.m. June 7.  </P> <P> The West Hollywood Homeless Organization, a nonprofit organization partially  funded by the city, will be opening a 70-bed shelter for the homeless this  summer at 1033 N. La Brea Ave.  </P> <P> In addition to housing, the shelter will provide health services, job training,  and counseling in AIDS awareness and prevention.  </P> <P> The fund-raiser is expected to draw some protests from a neighborhood group  that is opposed to the shelter. Members of the Eastend Community Action, a  neighborhood organization on West Hollywood's east side, are planning to picket  the fund-raiser because, they say, it will attract undesirables.  </P></p>

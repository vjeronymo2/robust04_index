			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Jan. 6 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam's  New Year press conference Thursday got a mixed reaction: The  administration and Kim's own party hailed the chief executive  for unveiling the direction of his policy in the coming year,  while the opposition criticized his policy as unrealistic.    The prime minister's office gave the president a high rating  because he presented the principle and direction of the policy  he will pursue in the second year of his administration.    He was clear and full of confidence in his speech, and his  appeal for concerted efforts at national development and  improved standards of living was impressive, it said.    Kim's stress on increased international competitiveness was  a  proper policy direction for the first year of an unlimited trade  war under the Uruguay Round trade pact, it said.    The National Unification Board said it was encouraged by the  optimism that Kim expressed about the future of inter-Korean  relations and expected his optimism to have a positive influence  on the North Korean nuclear issue, which is in the final stage  prior to solution.    The Foreign Ministry, which is in charge of the North Korean  nuclear problem, said it viewed Kim's remarks that he would do  his best to solve the nuclear issue and to improve inter-Korean  relations as the expression of a strong will to unravel pending  issues with North Korea.    Kim's positive view of the nuclear issue will help bring  North Korea to the meeting table as there are indications that  the North Koreans are moving to change their policy on this  issue, a ministry spokesman said.    The Defense Ministry said it was pleased with Kim's call on  the people to support and encourage the armed forces in its  process of rebirth under his military reform policy, which he  said he would continue in his second year in office. But some  ministry officials were worried about the possibility of a purge  of the military under his reform policy this year.    Members of Kim's Democratic Liberal Party, especially its  conservatives, said they were very happy with the president's  remarks that he, as president of the party, will not call a  national convention in May and that he will keep DLP Chairman  Kim Chong-pil in place for at least the coming 12 months.    Kim said politics should no longer be "a burden on the  people" and that all political energy and resources should be  focused on boosting the economy, especially on restructuring  agriculture so that it can get over the hardships of farm market  opening under the global trade pact, deputy party spokesman Cho  Yong-chik, who belongs to Chairman Kim's conservative faction of  the DLP, said.    Under Chairman Kim's leadership, the party is firmly united  to support President Kim in carrying out his policies, Cho added.    The democratic justice faction, which is also conservative,  attached less importance to President Kim's support of Chairman  Kim's leadership, saying that President Kim stressed the need to  place more emphasis on the economy than on politics this year.    The opposition Democratic Party said that it was  disappointed  at President Kim's address, because he was not specific on  pending issues. He failed to present any specific measures  against inflation, though this is one of the most important  problems to the people, and this reflects his easy-going  attitude on the pressing issues, party spokesman Pak Chi-won  said.    "He also failed to provide any specific programs for  internationalization and market opening, which he so  emphatically talked about," he added. "He disregarded the  people's right to know by refusing to discuss the progress in  negotiations on the North Korean nuclear issue."    Pak said that not calling a national convention of his party  this year reflected Kim's plan to neutralize politics by  rejecting party activity and consolidating one-man rule.    Rep. Mun Hui-sang, chief secretary to party chairman Yi  Ki-taek, charged that Kim did not go beyond basic and general  theories in discussing his policy.    "For instance, he emphasized the need to increase  competitiveness but he did not say anything specific about his  labor policy...," moon said. "His agricultural policy also lacks  specifics."    Rep. Kim Pyong-o, chief policymaker of the party, said:  "It's a farce that President Kim adorns his New Year press  conference with rosy optimism in this era of international  competition in which the law of the jungle prevails."    He said he regretted that Kim failed to offer a plan for  inter-Korean arms reduction, cultural exchange and economic  cooperation when peace settles on the Korean peninsula.</p>

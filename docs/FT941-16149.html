			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Warning as company cuts retirement age The decision by a Japanese company to lower its mandatory retirement age by four years has triggered concerns about the deteriorating labour environment and led to a strong warning by the labour ministry against other companies taking similar moves. Okuma, a leading machine tool maker, has applied to the employment authorities for permission temporarily to lower its mandatory retirement age from 60 to 56, in an effort to cut costs amid a sharp downturn in its businesses. The move led to a rare public warning by Mr Chikara Sakaguchi, Minister of Labour, that Okuma's move runs counter to a bill the ministry plans to submit soon to the Diet requiring employers to set the retirement age at 60, and would have serious social implications. While Okuma's temporary measure was agreed with its union, and the company said it intends to raise the retirement age to 60 as soon as possible,the labour ministry has launched a hearing into the matter. Mr Sakaguchi stressed that similar moves would lead to stringent guidance and warnings by the ministry. There is mounting concern in Japan about changes to the country's traditional labour contract. As Okuma's move shows, older employees are often victims of increasing company attempts to reduce labour costs. The problem is that Japan's corporate system encourages employees to devote a large part of their peak years to the company with the promise of rising salaries and benefits as they gain seniority. Older employees forced to leave earlier than they had counted on are thus being told to forfeit the benefits they feel are rightly theirs after decades of devotion to the company cause. A labour ministry study last autumn found 60 per cent of companies surveyed had implemented labour adjustment measures, such as restrictions on overtime work, secondments or transfers within the company, and temporary closures. Unemployment in Japan rose for three months to reach a six-year high of 2.8 per cent last November. Nikkeiren, Japan's Federation of Employers Associations, yesterday took the initiative in setting the mood for the spring wage round by suggesting a wage freeze this year.</p>

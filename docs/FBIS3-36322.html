At first the West did not understand the real situation in  the economies of the CIS countries, the Kazakhstani head of  state went on to say. Now it is starting to understand the  realities taking shape in the CIS. If I myself had not believed  in the Commonwealth's potential, I would never have been a  fervent supporter of the integration process. The fact that the  ruble zone, for which I also fought, has collapsed attests to  what has now become clear: We are different. The economies and  the states are different. We have become really independent  states. Some people, maybe among the Russian political  establishment, dislike this. As for Kazakhstan, I firmly  declare (not because I am afraid or apprehensive of something or  because I am engaging in intrigue): Strategically, Kazakhstan's  future is with Russia. The future of the people, the future of  the state, the future of the economy. This is not only  advantageous to Kazakhstan, it is also advantageous to Russia.  If we speak of independence, Russia was the first to proclaim  sovereignty in 1990. I was astounded at the time: from whom,  from what? But what is there to be surprised at now?    I do not regard sovereignty and independence as an end in  itself, the president went on to point out. The end is to  improve people's lives and the economy through this. When any  state signs some agreement, it assumes obligations and gives up  part of its sovereignty. The CIS countries' integration must  now proceed along a path similar to the West European one, as  the EC is doing. They are all independent states in the EC, and  they all have their own currency, political independence, and  freedom. Here, I believe, fate itself has determined a very  important place for Russia. Russia can act as a unifier by fully  recognizing sovereignties and not exerting any pressure, and  maybe it can forgo some things at first. We must do as the West  Europeans did, only not travel this path in 30 years, like they  did, but in a shorter space of time.</p>

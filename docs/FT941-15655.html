			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / French employers in interest rate plea The Patronat, the French employers' federation, yesterday called for further interest rate cuts, particularly for short-term loans, to help revive what it described as the country's stagnant economy. Mr Ernest-Antoine Selliere, the vice-chairman, said that gradual reduction in French interest rates over recent months had been insufficient. 'Economic activity has never revived without relatively low short-term interest rates,' he told a press conference, calling on the newly-independent Bank of France to show courage and move quickly to cut borrowing costs. France's intervention rate, the floor for money market rates, currently stands at 6.2 per cent.

The Patronat vice-chairman also defended French industry against charges that it has not done enough to help curb the rise in unemployment, which is currently standing at more than 12 per cent of the workforce. President Francois Mitterrand last week chastised employers for failing to create jobs despite having received FFr80bn (Pounds 9bn) through the removal of a delay in the reimbursement of value added tax payments, the transfer of family allowance welfare contributions for low-paid workers from companies to the state, and other measures. Mr Selliere also said he opposed a proposal by Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, that refunds of value added tax should be conditional on job creation. The proposal, made earlier this week, has drawn strong criticism from French industrialists. Mr Jacques Calvet, chairman of the Peugeot-Citroen automobile group rejected the idea as illogical. 'The state should pay back companies the sums which they are owed. There should not be any conditions.'</p>

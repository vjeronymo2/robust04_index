			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets: Malaysia and Singapore tumble Among the biggest global equity markets, early weakness based on suspect or poor economic data in the US and Germany was evened out later last week by nervous recoveries in America and Europe, and an extension of this year's relative strength in Japan. The FT-Actuaries World Index finished just 0.1 per cent down on the week in local currency terms. Asian shares were another matter entirely, Malaysia weakening 6.1 per cent after a 5.2 per cent advance in the week before, and Singapore taking a 4.5 per cent tumble. This left them 14.1 and 11.1 per cent lower respectively on the year so far, compared with gains of more than 120 per cent and nearly 70 per cent in 1993. Mr David Bates of Asia Equity in London says that Singapore, having fallen earlier this year along with other markets in south east Asia, had seen some feverish speculation in advance of the national budget on February 23 - which turned out to be conservative, although positive, rather than a giveaway budget when corporate and personal taxes were concerned. 'The market was certainly discounting a 2 percentage-point cut in corporation tax,' says Mr Bates, 'and it did not get it.' Malaysia, comments Mr Bates, was run up after the elections in Sabah which the ruling party lost, but only by a very narrow margin. However, there was no follow-through: 'The retail investor has become very cautious,' says Mr Bates, 'and it was the retail investor who was driving this market.' He adds that the Kuala Lumpur market is highly priced on fundamentals compared to its neighbours, but he also tends to link recent volatility in equities with the reduction in activity seen during the Moslem holy month of Ramadan, currently in progress. Last week's outperformer was South Africa, whose stock price gains, in the end, owed nothing to a weak gold bull-ion price. Above all, indust-rials were moved by initial confidence in talks between the African National Congress and the Zulu Inkatha Freedom Party; then disillusioned; and finally encouraged again as hopes rose at the end of the week.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                   % change    % change              -----------------------------------------------------------                 % change in local currency*      sterling*  in US Dlrs*              1 Week  4 Weeks   1 Year  Start of   Start of    Start of                                            1993       1993        1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria       -1.18    -4.06    +29.15    +40.93     +34.35     +32.23 Belgium       -0.51    -3.16    +21.73    +31.44     +25.39     +23.43 Denmark       -1.40    -2.90    +38.31    +51.75     +43.94     +41.69 Finland       +2.03    -4.30    +85.44   +127.69    +117.44    +114.05 France        -0.76    -6.08    +15.28    +24.91     +19.94     +18.05 Germany       -0.89    -4.05    +19.62    +32.17     +26.45     +24.46 Ireland       -0.74    -6.65    +37.80    +57.37     +40.87     +38.65 Italy         -0.93    -3.88    +22.81    +52.73     +35.40     +33.28 Netherlands   -0.19    -5.14    +27.16    +38.17     +32.30     +30.22 Norway        -2.45    -3.20    +51.39    +54.86     +46.05     +43.76 Spain         -0.53    -6.81    +36.11    +51.82     +25.28     +23.32 Sweden        -1.57    -4.18    +37.12    +47.69     +32.40     +30.32 Switzerland   -1.58    -8.50    +36.09    +41.02     +45.61     +43.32 UK            +0.03    -5.31    +14.90    +18.21     +18.21     +16.35  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EUROPE        -0.53    -5.40    +21.02    +29.24     +25.34     +23.37 Australia     -1.25    -9.27    +25.51    +31.46     +38.71     +36.52 Hong Kong     -0.67   -18.10    +54.36    +81.84     +85.07     +82.16 Japan         +0.71    +0.51    +28.23    +24.06     +49.13     +46.79 Malaysia      -6.11    -5.52    +88.18    +99.55     +94.66     +91.61 New Zealand   -1.01   -10.39    +40.22    +43.76     +62.79     +60.22 Singapore     -4.52    -7.81    +43.00    +50.23     +58.01     +55.54  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Canada        +1.14    -0.78    +20.80    +24.42     +18.26     +16.41 USA           -0.34    -1.09     +3.50     +6.14      +7.84      +6.14 Mexico        -0.76    -9.20    +55.85    +42.50     +39.41     +37.22  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- South Africa  +5.17    -0.18    +59.08    +63.47     +74.43     +71.68  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD INDEX   -0.10    -2.50    +16.89    +19.55     +25.95     +23.98  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Based on March 4th 1994.

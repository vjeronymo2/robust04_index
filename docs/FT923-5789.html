			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Fast ferry service for Channel Islands A HIGH-speed car ferry linking the Channel Islands with the British mainland and France is to be launched in the spring next year, Richard Tomkins writes. It will halve the shortest journey time offered by the existing conventional car ferry operated by British Channel Island Ferries, based in Poole, Dorset, which currently has a monopoly on the route. The service, to be launched by the Guernsey-based Condor ferry company, will use car-carrying catamarans similar to the SeaCats operating on cross-Channel routes. The first catamaran, being built by International Catamarans in Tasmania, Australia, will carry 600 passengers and 80 cars at a speed of 35 knots. It will be joined by a second vessel with a passenger capacity of 450. The catamarans will ply between Weymouth, Dorset, and Guernsey in 2hrs 15 mins; Weymouth and Jersey in 3 hrs; St Malo in France and Jersey in 1hr 10mins, and St Malo and Guernsey in 2hrs 40 mins. Condor's parent, the Guernsey-based Commodore Shipping, will partly finance the move by selling a 50 per cent stake in Condor to TNT, the Australian transport group.</p>

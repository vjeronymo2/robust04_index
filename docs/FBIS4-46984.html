			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by GUDOK correspondent V. Perzashkevich, Minsk: </F> "The Longest Train"]    [Text] The first of the radically new DRB1 diesel trains  has started running on the Polotsk-Vitebsk-Zaolsha section of  the Belarusian Mainline.    Unlike its sister trains, manufactured in series in Riga, it  consists of 10 rather than six cars. They are all trailer cars,  and they use two 2M62 diesel units instead of motor cars, one at  the front and one at the back. Including the design, it cost the  railroad 1.1 million dollars--one third cheaper than the usual  DR1A twin-diesel train also manufactured by the Riga plant. But  there are other advantages too.    "The motor cars being produced in Latvia now," says deputy  railroad chief V. Nazarenko, "are pulled by diesels obtained  from a defense plant, and they are designed for a short service  life, without repairs. So in five years the frame wears out and  cannot be rebuilt. During a diesel train's normal 20-year  service life, then, the engines will have to be replaced several  times. Costwise this is equivalent to buying a new train. The  hydraulic transmission is also unreliable, loses a lot of oil  and takes a lot of labor to repair."    Almost half of the railroad's diesel train fleet has been in  operation over 20 years. But they still have to be kept in use,  despite the costs of repairing and maintaining this type of  rolling stock, because the new Riga diesel train costs 750,000  dollars, and a German make costs five times that. The railroad  can't afford that right now.    The use of Riga-made trailer cars driven by a 2M62 diesel  does much to alleviate the shortage of commuter trains,  especially considering that the sharp decline in freight haulage  has made about 30 percent of such locomotives available. And  although they need to be modernized, at least it makes things  much less costly.    The new diesel train has a number of other attractive  features. In a stock train the cars are heated with hot air  delivered directly from the motor car's engine room; the new one  uses a combined method--heaters under the seats run off the  locomotive's generator, and additional heat comes from a special  air unit using heat from the diesel. The cars are lighted by a  radically new system. In a stock diesel train, electricity for  the lights comes from the starter generator with the motor  running; in the new make, it is provided by an independent unit.  Each car has a toilet and a 250-liter hot-water tank.    Still, it isn't only the new train's technical specs that  account for its appearance on the Belarusian Mainline; rather,  it's the acute shortage of commuter trains owing to rising  passenger traffic the past while. Earlier, the bus network  accommodated 95 percent of the republic's communities; this year  the number of bus runs on the routes has dropped to barely a  quarter. On the remaining routes the fare has gone up so much  that it's too much of a burden for a lot of people. Accordingly,  riders who used to take the bus have swelled the ranks of train  passengers. Basically these are workers who have to commute from  the suburbs to the major industrial centers, also persons who  commute to vacation spots and to their garden plots. Passenger  traffic has risen abruptly by almost 60 percent over 1990. And  the full brunt fell to the commuter trains--yet the train fleet  has remained almost the same size in the three years. The cars  are so full an apple wouldn't have room to fall.    In view of all this, the railroad's management asked  specialists of the Riga Railcar Plant to examine the technical  possibility of using 2M62 diesel units to drive 8- to 10-car  trains. They endorsed the idea, and immediately the partners  concluded a trilateral contract with a research and development  firm which was based in the old Riga branch of the All-Union  Scientific-Research Institute for Railcar Building. In a short  time a project was designed by which the plant built 10 trailer  cars and refurbished a diesel locomotive sent by the Belarusians.    The first operational tests of the new diesel train in Riga  was attended by specialists from the Polotsk Locomotive Depot,  headed by its chief, S. Bokhan. Incidentally, they acted so  professionally in dealing with the problems of adjusting the  additional equipment installed on the locomotive that they  earned high marks from the manufacturers.    Then the breaking-in tests were run on the  Polotsk-Krulevshchizna and Polotsk-Bigosovo sections, and they  confirmed the reliability of all the new train's systems. In  late April it carried its first passengers, after which the  train served sections between Polotsk and Glubokoye, Postavy,  and Vitebsk. The equipment was broken in, and the locomotive  crews learned the necessary skills. This was especially vital,  because there are certain peculiarities in the train's  operation. In particular, a second assistant engineer is needed  on the rear unit. In addition, extra platforms had to be built  at stops located on curved sections to permit observation of  passenger loading and unloading--after all, it's a long train.  Finally, the Polotsk Locomotive Depot has to provide facilities  for the maintenance and repair of trailer cars and diesel units.    "We have estimated," V. Nazarenko said, "that sections  having  heavy peak-hour passenger traffic will need 60 to 70 of these  long diesel trains; in other cases we can get by with short  trains. If this firstborn of ours demonstrates its operational  reliability, we can use the same technical principle to make  five- and six-car diesel trains driven by just one unit. In that  case, the lead car will be equipped with an engineer's cab to  control the diesel unit attached to the end. The Riga people are  willing to translate this idea into blueprints and metal.    "But we're also thinking about organizing the manufacture of  trailer cars in our own republic. Belarus has an excellent  machine-building and engineering potential. Right now, much of  the industrial complex is working below capacity or even  standing idle. Officials of Bobruyskfermmash, the big production  association, have proposed to the head of the railroad and the  State Committee for Industry and Intersectorial Facilities that  they organize the manufacture of these cars in their own plants.  They even went to Riga to familiarize themselves with the  relevant technology.    "There is nothing especially complicated about this.  Essentially, trailer cars are among the simplest kinds of  rolling stock. They don't have boilers and heating pipes,  generators, storage batteries, power switchboards, and coolers  for drinking water and air conditioners. All these functions are  provided in the motor car's engine room or, in our case, in the  locomotive. Railroad Chief Ye. Volodko gave his OK to the idea,  and the Gomel Giprozhivmash Institute is now working on  converting the Bobruysk Agricultural Machine-Building Plant to a  railcar-building plant.    "Of course, this 'reprofiling' will take a lot of financing,  and the railroad isn't in a position to bear the burden by  itself; the state budget will have to help...."    But, he who seeks will find. And the Belarusian Mainline has  offered to make its own contribution by using its own resources  to lay tracks on the territory of its future partner--if the  reprofiling really gets underway. Time will tell how things go.  Perhaps other railroad people in republics of the CIS will get  involved and contribute their bit.</p>

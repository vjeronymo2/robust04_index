			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / IMF and Egypt in loan accord The International Monetary Fund has endorsed Egypt's compliance with the IMF's first stand-by agreement with the country, triggering the forgiveness of Dollars 3bn of official debt and enabling talks to start on a fresh stand-by accord, writes Mark Nicholson in Cairo. The IMF board's approval of Egypt's economic reforms freed the final tranche of a Dollars 370m loan agreed in a deal originally struck with the IMF in May 1991. Endorsement of the programme had been due by last November, but was delayed first by disagreement over the scale of cuts in Egypt's budget deficit, then by IMF concern over the speed of the government's privatisation programme. The approval now signals IMF satisfaction with Cairo's progress on both.</p>

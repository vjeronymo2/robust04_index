			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / An everyday story of BBC folk: Raymond Snoddy explains the drama behind the drama of Eldorado FIRST there is a 50-year old called Bunny who goes to a funeral in England and brings a teenage bride called Fizz back to the Costa del Sol. Fizz is about to go missing, unlikely to return, although it is unclear whether this is because of the needs of the plot or the quality of her acting. Certainly Fizz's fate seemed to be a surprise to the actress portraying her, Kathy Pitkin. Then there is 40-something Trish Valentine and her toy-boy German lover Dieter, as well as many more characters, marooned on the mythical Costa Eldorado, who are about to be introduced have relationships and disappear. 'Everyone has a secret, and everybody is running away from something,' says Tony Holland, one of the creators of the BBC's Pounds 10m soap, or popular drama, in which 30 characters act out their tale of 'sun, sand, sangria - and of course sex' in an urbanisation in the mountains near Malaga. Right now it could be the bad ratings and unflattering things that have been said about some of the acting that some of the characters are running away from. Rumours that a serious coach crash will be written into the series soon have been vigorously denied. It is more difficult to deny that the three times a week drama, and Sunday omnibus edition, is having a tough time. It was supposed to shore up BBC1's ratings and even add maybe 1.5 per cent to the Corporation's audience share in the increasingly bitter battle with ITV. It started with an audience of 10m, but fell to between 4.4m and 5.7m in the week ending July 26. Even more ominously, the unofficial figure for last Friday's main showing was only 2.8m. So, just as interesting as the problems of Bunny and Fizz are the growing torments of three middle aged, talented and strong-minded characters called Julia, Jonathan and Verity. All three have much to lose. At stake for Julia Smith, a determined lady of a certain age, is her reputation as a creator of successful soaps. Her credits include EastEnders  -a more down-to-earth gritty soap which last week attracted an audience of more than 16m. Julia Smith has now retired from Eldorado suffering from exhaustion, after getting the drama on air. There are no plans for her to return within the next six months to the real Spanish village, which cost the BBC Pounds 1.5m. Corinne Hollingworth has been rushed out to Spain from Albert Square, the set of EastEnders, to be series producer. Jonathan Powell, the suave, charming controller of BBC 1, has even more to lose. Some say Jonathan could be in trouble even if Eldorado is a success. Big viewing figures for something as obviously populist as Eldorado could embarrass John Birt, who takes over as BBC director general in April with a mission to emphasise the Corporation's distinctiveness and public service broadcasting role. Jonathan, a stout fellow, is standing fully behind Eldorado and has little fault to find. He flew out to the set to tell the cast and the assembled tabloid journalists so on Wednesday. An acting coach is, however, being sent out in case help is needed with the more difficult scenes. For Verity Lambert, the powerful creator of Cinema Verity, the stakes are even higher than her three-year contract. Eldorado is the largest commission ever given to the UK's independent production sector. A flop would cause anguish in Charlotte Street in London where independents perch and hope. Luckily Verity has experience of turning programmes round. One of her previous creations, Minder, failed to set the world alight on its first outing. It is now one of the most popular drama series. It is too early to write off or write out Bunny, Trish and Dieter, Jonathan, Verity or even Julia. The sound of crashing soaps is not unusual at the beginning. Coronation Street was voted a disaster 32 years ago. EastEnders' audience dipped to 5m before starting its climb. Last week's ratings were particularly unrepresentative because of the competing attractions of the Olympics. Jonathan deliberately started Eldorado in the summer, when many of its potential viewers are on holiday in Spain so that it would have time to settle down in time for the autumn viewing season. Then, he hopes, Eldorado will come into its own. Jonathan had better be right, for besides giving the actors more coaching, killing off a few characters or doing more filming off the set, little can can be done to change the drama. To an unusual degree Eldorado is locked into its locale and format. And maybe audiences will just not be interested in the doings of rootless expats of various nationalities. Eldorado's fate should be clear from the mid-November ratings. Meanwhile the best chance of avoiding disaster is all the publicity generated by those who think it should be axed immediately.</p>

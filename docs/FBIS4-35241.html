			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Amman--Jordan, the Palestine Liberation  Organisation (PLO) and Israel will "soon" hold economic talks to  discuss economic ties among the three sides, Prime Minister  'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali said Saturday after meeting with Russian  presidential envoy Victor Posuvalyuk.    The prime minister did not indicate when and where the talks  would be held or whether they would materialise after the PLO  signs an economic agreement it had reached with the Kingdom in  Amman earlier this month.

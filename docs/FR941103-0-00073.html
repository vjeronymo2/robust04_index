			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> B1. Subpart 1 of Part D  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under section 172(b), the section 172(c) requirements are applicable as determined by the Administrator, but no later than three years after an area has been designated to nonattainment. EPA has not determined that these requirements were applicable to O <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  nonattainment areas on or before November 13, 1992, the date that the Commonwealth of Kentucky submitted a complete redesignation request for the marginal nonattainment areas. Therefore, the Commonwealth of Kentucky was not required to meet these requirements for purposes of redesignation. The Owensboro and Edmonson County areas currently have a fully approvable New Source Review (NSR) program which was last revised on June 23, 1994 (59 FR 32343). Upon redesignation of these areas to attainment, the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) provisions contained in part C of title I are applicable. On January 25, 1978, September 1, 1989, November 6, 1989, November 13, 1989, November 28, 1989, February 7, 1990, and June 23, 1994, the EPA approved revisions to the Commonwealth of Kentucky's PSD program (43 FR 3360, 54 FR 36307, 54 FR 46613, 54 FR 47211, 54 FR 488887, 55 FR 4169 and 59 FR 32343).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 176(c) of the CAA requires states to revise their SIPs to establish criteria and procedures to ensure that Federal actions, before they are taken, conform to the air quality planning goals in the applicable state SIP. The requirement to determine conformity applies to transportation plans, programs and projects developed, funded or approved under title 23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Act (``transportation conformity''), as well as to all other Federal actions (``general conformity''). Section 176 further provides that the conformity revisions to be submitted by states must be consistent with Federal conformity regulations that the CAA required EPA to promulgate. Congress provided for the state revisions to be submitted by November 15, 1992, one year after the date for promulgation of final EPA conformity regulations which were due November 15, 1991. When that date passed without such promulgation, EPA's General Preamble for the Implementation of Title I informed states that its conformity regulations would establish a submittal date [see 57 FR 13498, 13557 (April 16, 1992)].  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA promulgated final transportation conformity regulations on November 24, 1993, (58 FR 62188) and general conformity regulations on November 30, 1993 (58 FR 63214). These conformity rules require that states adopt both transportation and general conformity provisions in the SIP for areas designated nonattainment or subject to a maintenance plan approved under CAA section 175A. Pursuant to section 51.396 of the transportation conformity rule and section 51.851 of the general conformity rule, the Commonwealth of Kentucky is required to submit a SIP revision containing transportation conformity criteria and procedures consistent with those established in the Federal rule by November 25, 1994. Similarly, Kentucky is required to submit a SIP revision containing general conformity criteria and procedures consistent with those established in the Federal rule by December 1, 1994. Because the deadline for these submittals has not yet come due, they are not applicable requirements under section 107(d)(3)(E)(v) and, thus, do not affect approval of this redesignation request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On February 24, 1994, the Commonwealth of Kentucky revised their maintenance plan to commit to revise the SIP by November 25, 1994, to be consistent with the final Federal regulations on conformity. In addition, the Division for Air Quality and the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet are cooperating in adopting regulations consistent with the final conformity regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> B2. Subpart 2 of Part D  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The CAA was amended on November 15, 1990, Public Law 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399, codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401&hyph;7671q. EPA was required to classify O <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  nonattainment areas according to the severity of their problem. On November 6, 1991 (56 FR 56694), the Owensboro and Edmonson County metropolitan statistical areas (MSA) were designated as marginal O <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  nonattainment. Because these areas are marginal, the areas must meet section 182(a) of the CAA. EPA has analyzed the SIP and determined that it is consistent with the requirements of amended section 182. Below is a summary of how the area has met the requirements of these sections.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

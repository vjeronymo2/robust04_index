			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Land Secs warning Land Securities, the UK's largest quoted property group, tumbled 17 to 606p on turnover of 7.5m - the busiest session for 18 months - after warning about the second half. Interim profits of Pounds 118.9m, against Pounds 116m a year earlier, were in line with market expectations, but Land said higher interest charges brought about by its increased development programme will make it difficult for end of year profits to match those of the first half. Sentiment was also dampened by a slightly lower than expected 6.85p dividend. Mr Robin White at NatWest Securities said: 'This is confirmation from the major player in the sector that concerted rental growth has not yet returned.' Mr Alan Carter at James Capel, which issued a cautious note on the stock two weeks ago, said he was not surprised by yesterday's statement and added: 'The profits decline in subsequent years has been anticipated.' The sharp fall by Land Securities dragged MEPC, another leading property stock, lower by 8 to 408p.</p>

			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / International Company News: US biotech groups announce merger Two US biotech companies announced their merger yesterday, a move which could herald a series of similar moves from the cash-strapped sector, writes Daniel Green. Nexagen of Boulder, Colorado, and Vestar of San Dimas, California, will merge to form Nexstar Pharmaceuticals. Nexagen was floated earlier this year and, although it has the smaller market capitalisation, appears to be the senior partner in the deal. The new headquarters is in Boulder, and the chairman and chief executive of the new company are from Nexagen. The transaction will be effected through an exchange of 0.88 shares of Nexagen for each Vestar share. Nexstar will have a market capitalisation of aboutDollars 180m. Mr Viren Mehta, of biotechnology specialist research boutique Mehta and Isaly, said that the merger was 'indicative of the financial pressures in the sector and on these two companies'. He said that Nexagen's technology showed more promise than Vestar's even though Vestar already had a product approved and on sale in Europe.</p>

			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Survey of Venture and Development Capital (10): A language all its own - Buzzwords in Brief / The venture capital industry, like any other has its own jargon, some of it unprintable. Here, however, is Richard Gourlay's selection of expressions to help companies seeking capital through the linguistic maze Bimbo: Buy-in management buy-out. A hybrid between buy-in and buy-out where the venture capitalist will inject their own management team alongside existing managers. Burn rate: the rate at which a business uses up the funds it raises. Many bio-technology companies burn cash particularly fast. Business angel: private investor who finances small companies and sometimes gives them the benefit of his or her expertise. The best angels are those who have been in business and have advice worth hearing. Business plan: the document put together by managers to justify their application to financiers for backing. A good plan should contain summaries of past and projected profit and loss accounts, balance sheets and cash flows. Also details of products and services, markets, future strategy and profiles of the managers. A simple rule: rarely will life turn out as forecast in the business plan. Captive funds: venture capital organisations which form part of larger financial services groups. Usually they do not raise their own discrete funds but draw on the resources of their parents. Carried interest: the share in the proceeds of sale of an investee company that is kept by the venture capitalist. Corporate venturing: the practice of a large company taking an equity stake or establishing a joint venture with a smaller business to benefit from the smaller firm's specialist expertise. The large firm can provide finance, management back-up and distribution outlets which would not be available to the smaller partner. Deal flow: the number of investment propositions which come to the venture capitalist. What matters is quality not quantity. Development capital: later stage venture capital invested when the business has become established and needs extra funds for expansion. Enterprise investment scheme: the replacement for the government's discredited Business Expansion Scheme, the EIS gives front-end tax relief of 20 per cent for certain investments in certain companies as well as exemption from any capital gains. Unlike under the BES, investors can take an active part in EIS companies. Exit: the way a venture capitalist realises all or part of an investment by either arranging a flotation of the company or selling it to another company or trade buyer. A growing range of exits is becoming available and the list also includes a refinancing of the company by another group of venture capitalists or the purchase of all the shares by the company's own management. Hands on/hands off: some venture capitalists take a very close interest in their investee companies and will provide management expertise. Others, like 3i, monitor, but let the management get own with it. Hurdle rates: institutional investors have grown restive at the fees venture capitalists earn and have started to insist that funds achieve a basic return before managers can claim their carried interest. They often set hurdles based on a return on gilts or one of the leading stock market indexes and are beginning to look at more demanding hurdle measures like the FT-SE All share performance. Independent funds: these do not form part of larger financial groups. They raise their money from institutional and other investors. Internal rate of return (IRR): different people calculate this in different ways but it basically means the compound annual rate of return to the investor. It includes dividend distributions and profits from disposals or the profits shown on a fair valuation of an investee company. Inevitably, venture capitalists differ over when investments should be written down, up or off, so the figures are rarely strictly comparable. Lemons and plums: bad investments invariably go wrong before the good ones produce profits. The lemons usually ripen before the plums. Living dead: a portfolio company which is just about trading profitably but which shows little sign of ever meeting the venture capitalist's early high expectations. Management buy-in: the purchase of a business by an outside manager or team of managers with the help of a group of financial backers. Management buy-out: the purchase of a business by its existing management with the help of a group of financial backers. Most of the equity comes from the venture capitalist or other financial backer. The management puts up a small amount of finance for a disproportionately large percentage of the equity. Recovery or turnaround financing: supplied to companies in difficulties where the venture capitalist sees an opportunity to beef up or change the management and return the company to profits. Some venture capitalists have employed insolvency specialists to identify such investments. Refinancing: can be a sign of either failure or success. If a company performs poorly it may need an extra injection of funds. Equally, if it does very well, the management may be able to refinance the business on terms more favourable to themselves with their original venture capital backers. Replacement capital: funds provided to allow an existing shareholder to sell some or all of his shares. Second-round financing: venture capitalists rarely expect the first injection of funds to meet a business's needs. A second or even a third round of funding will almost certainly be needed later as the business grows or unforeseen problems arise. At this stage the original venture capital investor may reduce his holding and bring in others to spread the risk. Seed capital: usually quite small amounts of capital provided to turn a good idea into a marketable product or service. This can be the riskiest form of venture capital since the concept, the technology, the entrepreneur and the market are all unproven. Spin-out: a new company set up by a larger established group to exploit new developments or fresh market opportunities and in which the management team and a venture capital backer also take equity stakes. Star: a company which is so successful that it pays for all the failures and humdrum performers in the venture capitalist's portfolio. Sweet equity: the extra percentage of a company's equity which is allocated to the managers over and above the shareholding which their own relatively modest financial investment would qualify them for. The extra shares are seen as an additional motivation and reflect the fact that it is the managers' hard work which will ultimately make the venture succeed. (Sometimes also referred to as sweat equity to reflect the hard work the managers put in). Trade sale: the sale of a company to a corporate buyer. This is the most common exit route for venture capital backed companies. Venture capital: equity finance provided usually to young, unquoted businesses to enable them to start or expand. Equity funds provide a basis for the company to raise further bank finance and provide a cheap source of funds in the early stages of the business because dividends can be delayed until the company starts making profits. Virgin angel: a business angel who has not invested in private companies before.</p>

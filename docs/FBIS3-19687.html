Chancellor Helmut Kohl and other leading representatives  of the coalition categorically rejected the plan to introduce a  supplementary tax of 10 percent of the income tax on annual  salaries of up to 50,000 German marks [DM] for singles and  DM100,000 for married couples. In contrast, SPD Chairman Rudolf  Scharping defended the concept. His deputy, Oskar Lafontaine,  for his part, accused the government of planning further tax  increases. The government denied this.    Scharping rejected criticism of the planned supplementary  tax  as "wretched propaganda." Anyone who talks about "destroying  the readiness to work hard in Germany," is "not quite normal,"  Scharping told SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG. The difference between the  solidarity surcharge of 7.5 percent of their income tax, which  is planned by the coalition, and the supplementary tax, is  small. For a citizen with a monthly gross income of DM8,000 it  is only DM50. "I think that this is bearable; I do not expect  enthusiasm but understanding," the SPD chairman said. He said  that the coalition's claim that higher taxes make people less  willing to work hard a "completely trite and stupid theory."  Over the past years the upper income echelons have experienced  a considerable easing of burdens. If this had significantly  raised people's willingness to work hard, one should not be in  the most profound economic crisis since the end of the war now.  [passage omitted]</p>

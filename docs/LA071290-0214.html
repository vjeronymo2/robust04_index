			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> DAY-CARE OWNER FREE IN POT CASE  </P> <P> A woman who operated a licensed day-care center at her Reseda home was released  from jail on bail this morning after being arrested when Los Angeles police  found an eight-foot marijuana plant growing in her back yard, authorities said.  </P> <P> Kim McIntyre, 28, was arrested Tuesday on suspicion of cultivating marijuana, a  felony, and was released from the Van Nuys jail this morning in lieu of $5,000  bail.  </P> <P> Police searched her home in the 19500 block of Vanowen Street after receiving a  tip about the marijuana plant. Lt. Gary Rogness said investigators found two  plants -- one eight feet tall with a branch span of five feet -- a small amount  of marijuana inside the house and a loaded rifle that was not properly secured  from the children.  </P> <P> Rogness said eight children under McIntyre's care were at the home when  officers searched it. He said McIntyre told detectives that she was growing the  marijuana to save money for her pot-smoking boyfriend. Police were looking for  the boyfriend for questioning. McIntyre denied smoking the drug, but told  investigators she had put it in homemade brownies and cookies.  </P> <P> There was no indication that McIntyre gave marijuana-laced brownies or cookies  to children in her care, Rogness said.  </P> <P> Police said they may seek child endangerment charges against McIntyre and her  arrest has been referred to the state Department of Social Services, which  licenses day-care centers.  </P></p>

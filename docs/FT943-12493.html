			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Observer: Both barrels Onward marches the UK nanny state, despite a government spiritually, if not actually, committed to minimising state interference. The latest inroad comes from the Health and Safety Executive, with its first-ever guidance for gamekeepers; there are about 5,000 full-time gamekeepers in the UK, with an estimated 28,000 part-timers. The HSE's missive drives home the message that, far from imbroglios of the type contemplated by DH Lawrence in Lady Chatterley's Lover, contemporary guardians of winged snacks face much greater hazards from faulty or damaged guns. Another danger, of course, is carelessness during beating; something of a Lawrentian trope, after all.</p>

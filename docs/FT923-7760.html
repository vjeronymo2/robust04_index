			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Baker faces formidable challenge: Latest opinion polls show Bush continuing to lag behind Clinton POLITICAL America took stock yesterday of the impact of Mr James Baker's return to the White House and the messages of a fistful of new public opinion polls released before next week's Republican convention in Houston. The polls demonstrated how formidable Mr Baker's task will be to bring victory in November for President George Bush over Mr Bill Clinton, the Democratic candidate. But at least they show some narrowing of the gap between the two. A Wall Street Journal/NBC survey had the Arkansas governor ahead by 54-36 per cent, while one conducted for USA Today and CNN showed him leading by 56-37 per cent. Both were below his 20 point-plus lead in most other polls. At the same point four years ago Mr Bush had virtually caught up with Mr Michael Dukakis. Both surveys showed Mr Bush's job approval rating at near-historic lows. Equally disturbing for his party, the Journal/NBC poll found the electorate more inclined than ever before in the Bush presidency to vote for the Democrats in Congressional races. Mr Bush and Mr Baker would also find bleak reading in a compilation by the newsletter, The Hotline, of the 29 state polls taken since the Democratic convention last month. Mr Clinton is ahead in all but one, Utah, where he has nearly caught the president. In 20 states, with more than enough electoral college votes to win the presidency, his lead is bigger than the usual margin of polling error. Mr Baker's assumption of the political reins was generally welcomed by Republicans, including those on the right known to distrust him. Conservative luminaries, including Mr Dan Quayle, the vice president, and Mr Jack Kemp, the housing secretary, agreed he could bring focus to a disorganised campaign. Some of the inherent divisions within the party were re-emphasised yesterday with the publication of interviews with Mrs Barbara Bush. The president's wife said she did not think the question of abortion had any place on the party platform, which, as drafted this week, includes the demand for a constitutional amendment banning it. She also criticised Mr Rich Bond, Republican national chairman, for his personal attacks this week on Mrs Hillary Clinton and said she did not like the scrutiny of Mr Clinton's private life. But she did think his avoidance of military service in the late 1960s was a legitimate area of inquiry. Mr Clinton, meanwhile, continued to take on the president in his presumed area of strength, foreign policy. In Los Angeles late on Thursday, he said: 'In a world of change, security flows from initiative, not inertia.' Directly addressing Mr Baker's recitation of administration successes abroad, he said: 'The notion that the Republicans won the cold war reminds me of the rooster who took credit for the dawn.' Communism, he went on, 'rotted from the inside out, with heroes both famous and unknown leading the way'. 'From the Baltics to Beijing, from Sarajevo to South Africa, this president has sided with the status quo instead of democratic change,' an approach that would change if he became president. He cited Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt as men who went to the White House straight from governorships and who led the country to victory in two world wars. It was, he said, all a matter of personal strength, values and judgment. Rabin pledges to complete work on settlement units, Page 3</p>

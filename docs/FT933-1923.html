			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / West backs Russian leader but markets waver WESTERN leaders yesterday gave broad backing to President Boris Yeltsin in his battle for power with the Russian parliament, but Wall Street underlined their nervousness by ending the day sharply down. President Bill Clinton said he 'believed that the path to elections for a new legislature was ultimately 'consistent with the democratic and reform course', and Mr Warren Christopher, his secretary of state, said support for Russian reform at this time was 'an investment in the national security of the United States'. Mr Clinton had delayed any substantial comment on the events in Moscow until he had spoken with the Russian leader by telephone 'to seek assurances that the difficult choices that he faces will be made in a way that ensures peace, stability and an open political process'. The White House seemed to be caught by surprise at the turn of events in Moscow, but Mr Clinton acknowledged that Mr Yeltsin faced 'a constitutional crisis that had reached a critical impasse and had paralysed the political process'. Arriving in Washington, Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, was much more forthright in his backing for Mr Yeltsin's dissolution of a 'hangover from the past'. 'I believe that President Yeltsin is justified in what he has done. His democratic credentials are far stronger than those of the body that has been dissolved,' Mr Hurd said, accusing the Russian parliament of wanting 'to one degree or another, to go back to a communist state'. In Bonn, however, the government made no formal pledge of support. It said Germany was watching developments with great concern, and Chancellor Helmut Kohl was being kept constantly informed. A proper evaluation of the events was not possible, because of the lack of clarity about the outcome. It was unclear whether Mr Yeltsin had informed western powers of his intentions in advance. Reports from Bonn said western ambassadors in Moscow, had been told, but delayed reaction appeared to belie this. One senior US official said that Mr Christopher had received warnings more than a week earlier, but the State Department insisted that it had only learnt of the plans an hour beforehand. Britain was the first country to throw its support decisively behind Mr Yeltsin. Mr John Major, the prime minister, on a visit to Malaysia, issued a statement stressing that Mr Yeltsin was the first democratically elected president in Russia and urging support for his reforms. This position was echoed more moderately in France, where Mr Alain Juppe, the foreign minister, said Mr Yeltsin now had democratic legitimacy in Russia. In New York the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 38.56 to close at 3,537.24, while news of the turmoil pushed the dollar, gold and oil prices higher. In early Tokyo trading today, the Nikkei shed more than 270 points. The reaction on US grain markets was subdued, largely because Russia's status as a US grain buyer has been diminished by its poor credit position.</p>

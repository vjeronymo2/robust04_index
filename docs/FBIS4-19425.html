			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Ralf Falter: "Costs and Benefits"] </F>   [Text] Every day the Belgian Government and Army leaders  are having to make dramatic and sometimes historic decisions  about Rwanda. Should the UN formalities be awaited before  withdrawing the Belgian UN troops from the destroyed country?  Can violence be used to prevent Kigali airport being fired  upon? What should be done with the now thousands of Rwandans  wanting to leave and what procedure will be used to select who  is allowed to come along? As the departure of the last aircraft  from Kigali airport approaches, the tempo of such decisions  increases.    One of the difficult political decisions concerns the  Belgian  UN troops. Foreign Minister Willy Claes has said that "they  will not stay in Rwanda under any circumstances." In concrete  terms, that means that they will fly back with the paratroopers  who were there to help the refugees. Does that also mean:  without procrastination? Yesterday the ambiguity on the  subject had not been fully cleared up. The army had received no  formal order to withdraw the UN troops.    That could simply be because the government wants to show  consideration for the United Nations for as long as possible.  Something similar happened during the decolonization of the  Congo in 1960. The delay of the evacuation yesterday also makes  it possible to keep up the appearance that the UN troops will  only depart after a decision by the Security Council. But even  if New York should decide against the departure of the UN  troops, Belgium may not delay. The safety of its soldiers, who  can do nothing more on the ground, weighs heavier than the  limited loss of face of UN representatives or even African  political leaders' fears of the destabilization of Central  Africa. To prevent that, some 400 UN troops are certainly not  enough.    But the UN chapter will not be closed with the evacuation of  the 2nd Commando Battalion, which made up the bulk of the  Belgian UN troops in Rwanda. It is insufficient to just ask the  United Nations to investigate the murder of the 10 Belgian UN  soldiers last Thursday [7 April]? In New York, it will become  one of the many cases for which there will never be time.    An internal investigation to see whether errors were made,  is  also necessary. Given that it is now known the murders took  place on Thursday morning, fairly soon after the attack on the  Rwandan and Burundian presidents, then it is becoming clear that  there was very little time for a new assessment of the  situation. This makes a flagrant error unlikely. But that does  not make an investigation superfluous, even if only because very  many questions and much discontent remain in the paratroop  battalion concerned.    A total assessment of the role and above all the  vulnerability of the UN troops is necessary in any case, not  just in the United Nations, but also within the Belgian  Government. Six Belgian UN soldiers died in Somalia. They  carried out useful work, but it now appears that little remains  of it. In Bosnia yesterday, the conflict escalated to such a  point that more than 15 UN troops were taken hostage by the  Bosnian Serbs in spite of all the stepped-up arms and NATO  threats.    To put it soberly, the costs of UN operations are starting  to  outweigh the benefits. Belgium, which has cooperated very  generously with the peace forces but then paid a relatively high  price, can no longer put up with any indecisiveness or  bureaucratic inertia in New York. If the United Nations does  not make its own military apparatus more efficient, something  for which our country has already made a large number of  suggestions, then we would do better to pass from now on.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Express Analysis" report by A. Yevgenyev: "Inflation </F> Curbed. But..."]    [Text] The State Committee for Statistics has prepared  some useful data illustrative of the socioeconomic situation in  Russia in January-March. Compared with the corresponding period  last year the gross domestic product is 17 percent down. The  decline in industry is worsening, with production volume in  physical terms standing at 75.1 percent of last year's level,  the figures for the specific months being 76.9 percent in  January, 75.9 in February, and 72.6 in March.    According to State Committee for Statistics experts, the  structural nature of the production decline became evident in  the first quarter. This was manifested by the fact that the  scale of it is increasingly determined by effective demand, not  by resource potential. As a result, sectors reacted differently  to the developing market situation. Whereas gas extraction  virtually remained at last year's level, 9-15 percent less oil  and coal was extracted. At the same time, production of many of  the basic types of machine-building products and a number of  light industry goods almost halved, chemical production fell by  25-30 percent, and ferrous metallurgy production fell by 20-35  percent. Food production fell by 10-20 percent.    Of the 406 most important types of products included in the  special report, 26 saw an increase in production volume and 373  items saw a decrease. Individual production processes were  halted at 5,000 enterprises. But whereas at the beginning of  the last year this was mainly due to lack of raw materials,  supplies, and fuel, the main reason now is different -- problems  marketing products (more than 60 percent of all losses).    Unfortunately, there is a mounting crisis in the sectors  producing consumer goods. Garment production has been  particularly badly hit: Production of overcoats, short coats,  and skirts fell by 61-68 percent; production of raincoats and  jackets fell by 53-58 percent, and production of pants and suits  fell by 41-42 percent. Fewer goods were produced for private  farms, subsidiary plots, and horticultural enterprises:  Production of front-wheel-drive tractors and rotovators fell by  10 percent, and of compact tractors by more than 25 percent.    Livestock raising output is falling. According to the data,  the volume of sales of livestock and poultry by all categories  of farms fell by 13 percent, milk production fell by nine  percent, and egg production by six percent.    Russia's favorable balance in trade with far-off foreign  parts is increasing. Although not so much through increased  exports (they rose by 2.9 percent, reaching $8.9 billion), as  through a reduction in imports (27 percent down on the first  quarter of last year, the total volume being $3.8 billion).    As for prices of goods and services, they rose by 44 percent  in the third [as published] quarter. This is one of the  smallest increases since the beginning of the economic reform.  Average pay in March was 160,000 rubles [R]. The disposable  income of the population (income excluding obligatory payments),  taking into account the consumer prices index, rose by  approximately 10 percent over the year. But the incomes of 17  percent of the population (that is, 25.2 million people) were  below the poverty line in the first quarter of 1994, while in  six percent of cases incomes did not even meet the cost of the  basic essential foods, which is set at R37,000.</p>

			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / International Company News: Du Pont settles 220 fungicide claims Du Pont, the US chemicals group, has agreed to pay Dollars 214m to settle 220 cases stemming from use of its fungicide Benlate, leaving 270 cases still to be resolved. The settlements, which the company said were covered by previous provisions, stem from claims by farmers that a version of Benlate withdrawn from the market in 1991 caused damage to crops. Du Pont had at one stage agreed to pay compensation to all Benlate users, though it withdrew the offer in 1992 when it received new information suggesting the fungicide did not cause crop damage. Before the latest settlements, some 70 cases had been disposed of either by court judgments or settlements. The company had set aside Dollars 476m after tax to meet Benlate payments which exceeded its insurance cover. It did not say how much of the latest Dollars 214m was covered by insurance. Du Pont continued to insist the fungicide was not defective, and said it was settling the cases only because of the high costs associated with defending them.</p>

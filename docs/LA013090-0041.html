			<p><P> January 30, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAHONY BREAKS OFF TALKS WITH GRAVEDIGGERS  UNION  </P> <P> Saying that 97 gravediggers employed by the Los Angeles Roman Catholic  Archdiocese have filed a petition stating that they "no longer want to be  represented by the union," Archbishop Roger M. Mahony broke off negotiations  Monday with the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union and said he  would hold a new election.  </P> <P> But Barbara Mejia, Amalgamated's California manager, said the union will not  agree to new balloting.  </P> <P> "We believe this is another attempt on the archdiocese's part to avoid  negotiations," she said.  </P> <P> Last Feb. 8, workers at the 10 archdiocese-run cemeteries voted 66 to 62 for  union representation for one year, and an arbitration panel validated the  election on Nov. 22 despite claims of worker harassment by the union. The  archbishop contended Monday that the one-year union agreement expires next  month, but Mejia said that the year starts from the panel's ruling in November.  </P></p>

			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Markets: Drugs emerge from a coma - The Bottom Line AFTER A year of apparently slipping into an ever deeper coma, drugs stocks jerked awake this week. The health and household sector, dominated by drug stocks Glaxo, SmithKline Beecham and Wellcome, recorded its steepest rise of the year and recovered to its best level for two and a half months. The immediate stimuli were the record breaking rally in the rest of the market, a drug approval in the US for Glaxo and some conciliatory words from US President Bill Clinton, whose administration is determined to limit drug bills. Expert opinion is divided over whether the effects are just temporary: will the sector embark on the road to recovery or will it suffer a relapse? By any account, the shares remain weak. From having been the star sector of the 1980s, they languish at a deep discount to the rest of the market even after the latest gains. The problem is that drug prices and profit margins remain under pressure. The Clinton administration and cash hungry governments in Europe and Japan argue that drug bills have been rising too quickly and must be controlled. President Clinton's plans seem likely to involve more intervention by government to cut costs. They could include the provision of universal healthcare coverage and the establishment of health 'alliances' that would push for healthcare plans to cut their charges. Already, the fear of legislation may have contributed to a fall in drug price inflation in the US towards the level of general inflation. Some investors fear that the squeeze on drugs will not stop there. Healthcare reforms in the US, easily the world's biggest market, promise to cut the number of drug buyers through Health Insurance Purchasing Co-operatives. These will have greater buying power and therefore the ability to strike discount deals with drug makers. Lehman Brothers is one of the leading pessimists of the sector. It argues that only UK and European investors have been buying drug company shares this week and they do not understand the implications of Clinton's plans as well as US investors. It also fears there is a chance Glaxo will lose a patent case in the US over its best selling drug Zantac. Sales of Zantac, an ulcer treatment, are worth about Dollars 3.5bn a year. If Glaxo lost, other companies would be able to sell a generic (unbranded) version from 1995. Ian Smith, a drug sector analyst at broker Lehman Brothers in London, estimates that Glaxo would then lose Dollars 700m of revenue in the first year alone. Even the uncertainty over law suits and regulation alone has been depressing share prices. At least one broker was talking this week of a 'black hole' in the pricing of drugs. No wonder that the drug sector, once the most expensive in the London market, is now trading at a price/earnings ratio of about 6 per cent below the market average even after this week's gains. In the face of this apparently overwhelming evidence, it is hard to hear the voices of the sector's optimists, however persuasive their arguments seem. They say that investors have been unwitting pawns in a political game being played by the drug companies to limit the damage government will inflict on them. The drug industry is churning out bad news items in an effort to portray itself as vulnerable. At the same time it is less than enthusiastic about presenting events which bolster its image. One broker has produced a stack of statistics to show that proposed US healthcare changes will cut drug prices mostly for the working population, not for the very young or old, its main customers. It even predicts that Glaxo can survive losing its patent suit virtually unscathed by cutting costs. This broker is, however, not prepared to be publicly associated with these views. It was overwhelmed by buying orders earlier in the week and is still struggling to buy drug sector shares while they are still close to their lows.</p>

			<p><P> March 3, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE;  </P> <P> REOPENING PLANNED OF 2 HIGHWAY LANES  </P> <P> City officials announced Friday that a stretch of coastal highway will be  reopened in two weeks, but the roadway will not be fully accessible until July  1.  </P> <P> Two lanes of El Camino Real between Camino Capistrano and Avenida Pico will be  opened while crews work to shore up the 1,800-foot-long cliff that runs  adjacent to the highway, according to City Manager Michael Parness.  </P> <P> The roadway has been closed since Feb. 6.  </P> <P> A bike path, also closed since then, will also be reopened.  </P> <P> Closure of the road has caused traffic problems and complaints from a handful  of business owners who say that customers can no longer reach their stores.  </P> <P> The two lanes that will be opened to relieve traffic congestion will close  again in April while crews haul away up to 200,000 cubic yards of dirt from the  site.  </P> <P> The two lanes will then reopen May 15, Parness said, and remain open through  July.

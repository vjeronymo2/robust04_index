			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / International Capital Markets: Portuguese withholding tax changes approved Portugal yesterday approved changes to its fiscal system to enable non-resident investors to receive an automatic refund of the 20 per cent withholding tax which is levied on Portuguese government bonds. Although Portugal has double-taxation treaties with most countries, many foreigners have been deterred from buying Portuguese government bonds in the past because of the lengthy procedure involved in reclaiming the tax which is levied on the coupons. The widely-expected fiscal reform, which will apply to around Dollars 6bn worth of Portuguese government bonds listed on the Lisbon stock exchange, is part of the government's efforts to develop its domestic capital markets and attract more foreign investment. Modelled on the Belgian system for refunding the tax to non-residents, the changes should also improve secondary market trading in Portuguese government bonds because dealers will be able to quote the coupons gross of, rather than net of, the withholding tax. The system should come into operation within a few weeks, once the decree is signed.</p>

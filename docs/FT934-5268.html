			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (17): Top dogs still get the meatiest bones THE COST OF TALENT: HOW EXECUTIVES AND PROFESSIONALS ARE PAID AND HOW IT AFFECTS AMERICA By Derek Bok Free Press Dollars 22.95 342 pages This book is unlikely to get a mention in those seasonal newspaper articles about what top business people will be reading over Christmas. More's the pity. Senior executives on both sides of the Atlantic are no doubt sick of being lectured on the excessive size of their compensation packages. But they cannot accuse Derek Bok of mindless envy - the weakness of some critics - nor of approaching his subject exclusively from the corporate governance perspective While institutional shareholders, remuneration consultants and business academics continue their struggle to link pay to performance, the former president of Harvard University and dean of the Harvard Law School has taken a much wider sweep. Bok's themes include analysis of why some people are rewarded better than others, the history of executive and professional pay in the US, and the motivation effect of big money. The fundamental thesis is that the vast rewards and incentives enjoyed by America's top medical specialists, Wall Street's elite law firms, and leading business managers is diverting badly-needed talent from the nation's schools, universities and public administration. Society, in other words, is the main loser. Bok is an unashamed moralist. As he states near the beginning of the book: 'The most vexing moral question is why so many people fortunate enough to hold the most interesting, prestigious jobs . . . should earn many times the pay of those condemned to work that is much more boring and disagreeable.' This idea crops up time and again, the message being that there is no satisfactory justification. The rise of the professions indeed has been a recent phenomenon, as evidenced by the fact that doctors in 1900 were paid only half as much as university professors and less even than Federal officials. Increasingly strict entry requirements in law and medicine later limited the numbers joining those professions - with a beneficial impact on their members' incomes. Teachers and academics, however, could not control supply in the same way. The key to rising executive salaries, Bok argues, lay not in limiting access but in gaining control of the corporation. So long as owners remained in charge and hired professional managers to run their companies salaries were ample but not extravagant. JP Morgan made a point of not paying any executive more than 20 times the earnings of the lowliest employee in an organisation. Once professional managers became accountable to ill co-ordinated armies of small shareholders, however, the way became 'clear to granting emoluments on the lavish scale we know today'. In the 1920s - a time of booming markets in the US - a few chief executives like Charles Schwab of US Steel, Eugene Grace of Bethlehem, and George Washington Hill of American Tobacco received bonuses in the good years that lifted their total pay above Dollars 1m (or roughly Dollars 8m in today's currency). Bok usefully exposes what he euphemistically calls the 'special characteristics' of the market for private sector professionals. He points out that while limiting supply helped boost incomes earlier in the century, doctors and lawyers have continued to prosper in the last couple of decades despite intensifying competition and rapidly expanding professional numbers. This is partly explained by the value of professional reputations, which allow those which have them to gain advantages over those who do not but who may have equal abilities. Price pressure and negotiation, moreover, is often absent because the cost of hiring, say, the best lawyer is a tiny part of any corporation's overall budget. Doctors are often paid according to an official scale of fees. Bok is also good at refuting apologists for high pay, knocking down arguments that huge rewards can be justified when compensation fluctuates wildly from year to year (mostly it does not), that the sums involved are trivial for the country as a whole (no longer the case), and that the wealthy invest their fortunes wisely and imaginatively for the good of society (generally not true). His most controversial contention, though, is that sky-high pay packages have at least partially been responsible for the shift of able students away from careers in the public sector to careers in the private sectors. It is a not unfamiliar lament, but as you would expect from someone in his position the argument is backed up with exam scores and analysis of Phi Beta Kappa graduates.</p>

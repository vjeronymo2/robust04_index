			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> NBA NOTES;  </P> <P> IT'S GETTING MIGHTY CROWDED IN THE WEST  </P> <P> Listen closely, folks. That distant murmuring you hear is coming from the West,  and it's the sound of nervous fans, coaches and general managers coming to the  realization that they're fighting for their playoff existence.  </P> <P> Forget about the Los Angeles Lakers for a moment, and look at the gridlock  that's forming in back of them in the Western Conference standings, which are  starting to resemble midtown Manhattan at 4 o'clock on a Friday afternoon.  </P> <P> Going into Thursday night's games, the eight teams behind the Lakers were  separated by just three games in the loss column. And three of the league's  supposed premier teams -- Dallas, Denver and Portland -- are perilously close  to falling into ninth place.  </P> <P> "Before the season, I told our coaches this would be the strangest season of  all," Lakers General Manager Jerry West said.  </P> <P> West said he suspected some of his team's chief rivals might slip this season.  When teams reach a certain level, say 50 wins, expectations naturally become  heightened. But achieving them is another thing. "Frankly," West said, "they  haven't done it to this point."  </P> <P> West didn't name teams, but he was clearly referring to the Mavericks, Nuggets  and Blazers, three clubs that have, for a variety of reasons, been performing  below the standards they established a year ago.  </P> <P> Denver won 54 games last season, Dallas and Portland 53 apiece. All three were  perceived as a threat to the Lakers this year. With the Lakers slipping,  they're slipping too, and they don't seem any more capable of beating Los  Angeles now than a year ago.  </P> <P> In fact, the only teams that have made significant strides in the West are  Phoenix and Golden State, two lottery teams that have made stunning  turn-arounds after hiring veteran coaches -- Cotton Fitzsimmons in Phoenix and  Don Nelson for Golden State.  </P> <P> Golden State's resurgence has been particularly remarkable, considering they've  done it largely without Ralph Sampson and with a lineup that includes four  guards (if you count Chris Mullin) and 6-8 Larry Smith at center.  </P> <P> "I love playing for (Nelson)," Mullin said. "He's the best coach I've had by  far. He doesn't get caught up in positions. He expects you to be a basketball  player. I can't remember when I've had this much fun playing basketball."  </P> <P> Nelson has his team thinking playoffs. No doubt, certain of his coaching rivals  can't remember being this concerned about missing them altogether.  </P> <P> Rik Smits, Indiana's 7-4 rookie center, has averaged 15.2 points on 57.4  percent shooting in six games since Dick Versace took over as the Pacers' head  coach.  </P> <P> Smits hasn't made a very profound impression on certain NBA veterans, however.  After watching Smits score 21 points in 20 minutes last week against Boston,  Kevin McHale referred to him as "Rich Smiths," and Danny Ainge simply dismissed  him as "Whatshisname."  </P> <P> But the league's general managers apparently have been taking notice of the  Dunking Dutchman's development.  </P> <P> "I'll tell you what," said Indiana General Manager Donnie Walsh, "everyone is  talking to me about him now. I'm so happy I took him (with the second pick in  the draft). The other night at Miami, he made a dunk you wouldn't believe. He  was like a whooping crane or something."  </P> <P> Notes  </P> <P> Larry Bird says he probably won't compete in the Long Distance Shootout at the  All-Star Game Feb. 12 in Houston. Bird, the three-time defending champ in the  event, says it wouldn't be fair to his Celtics teammates for him to win the  $12,500 first prize, then return to the disabled list for another month. ...  Bird on the Pacers: "Every year I look at them and think they're going to be  dangerous. Then for some reason, they're not. I guess they're just one Larry  Bird short." Just like the Celts, eh? ... Seattle's Jerry Reynolds, after an  uninspiring effort by the Sonics: "Things could be worse. I could be married to  Robin Givens." ... Golden State is offering a seven-game ticket package called  the 'Nute Plan in honor of 7-7 backup center Manute Bol. Bol, by the way, still  owes a few cows to his father-in-law in Sudan, in accordance with his nuptial  agreement. "If you don't have money or cows, it's hard to get married," said  Bol, who was married a year ago. "I paid 80 cows. I only pay 32 so far, so when  I go back home, I pay the rest." ... Add Atlanta's Chris Washburn to the list  of former North Carolina State players who've come to the support of Jim  Valvano: "If they changed grades, why didn't they change enough to get me a  diploma?" ... Sacramento has informed oft-injured off guard Derek Smith he no  longer figures in their plans. ... Former Utah coach Frank Layden says he's on  the Oprah Winfrey diet. "It's not a diet," said Fat Frank, "it's a fast."  </P></p>

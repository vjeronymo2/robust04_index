			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Four of Algeria's six main political parties are  boycotting the national conference which opens today. Former  President Ben Bella's Movement for Democracy in Algeria has also  decided not to attend. [passage omitted]    All the boycotting parties have denounced the conference as  a  put up job with its outcome decided in advance by the  authorities. Hocine Ait Ahmed, president [as heard] of the  Socialist Forces Front, had this to say:    [Begin Ahmed recording] The conference organized by the  authorities is a pseudo-conference. I believe that not only can  we not conceive of a transition based on a fire that is raging  and spreading but also that it would be too facile and stupid  not to involve the Islamic movement in the government, thus  forcing them into an underground existence and turning them into  heroes with clean hands.    For the past 30 years in Algeria we have not been engaging  in  politics but rather in plotting and scheming. This national  conference has been brought about solely to endorse what has  already been decided behind the scenes, by what I call the  family conclave. Organizations and persons determined beforehand  are going to be imposed on us. What is being pursued is a  policy of the fait accompli, hence the utmost contempt in which  it is held by Algerian public opinion and by the political  parties. [end recording]</p>

			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Letter: Housing policy a danger to standards Sir, Your editorial ('Housing policy', February 5) makes absolute sense. One of the great problems facing housing associations has been arbitrary change in government regulation. It is happening again: in effect part of the financial regime set up in 1989 is being dumped. In that regime housing association grant has been calculated from a formula which included cost, interest rates and affordability to tenants. What is happening now is that (presumably) the Treasury is ordering a cut in grant to 55 per cent in two years, which will drive rents well beyond the reach of the low paid. Certain MPs, particularly Sir Paul Beresford, have suggested that private property developers should be allowed to compete with housing associations for government grant. In my view this will lead to low construction standards and uncertain standards of housing management. Surely the lesson of the 1960s policy errors is that the drive to lower costs is often misconceived. Housing associations are not perfect; nor are they mad bureaucracies. It cannot be in the national interest to destroy diversity and local accountability.

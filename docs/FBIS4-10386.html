			<p>BFN     [Text] Voters' preferences for PT [Workers Party] candidate  Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva have risen, in one month, from 30 to  36 percent, while preferences for PSDB [Brazilian Social  Democracy Party] candidate Fernando Henrique Cardoso rose from  11 to 20 percent, putting him in second place in the  presidential race. Both benefited from PPR [Progressive Renewal  Party] candidate Paulo Maluff's walking out of the race.    These results are part of the first nationwide poll by  Datafolha following the deadline for candidates to resign their  current government posts (2 April). Preferences for Leonel  Brizola (PDT) [Democratic Labor Party] and for Orestes Quercia  (PMDB) [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] stood at 10 and 8  percent, respectively. FOLHA is for the first time publishing  charts comparing the performance of parties in the campaigns of  1989 and 1994. The PT and the PSDB have improved their  performance in all regions, while Brizola became weaker,  especially in southern Brazil.</p>

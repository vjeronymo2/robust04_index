			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, April 12 (XINHUA) -- Many of those just  appointed by the Chinese Government as the third batch of Hong  Kong affairs advisers pledged to give full play of their roles  in the dialogue between the Chinese Government and local  residents.    Fung Kin-kee, chairman of the Association for Democracy and  People's Livelihood, said, "This provides me a good chance to  have direct dialogue with the Chinese Government. I will give  different views if it is necessary."    James Wong, a noted composer and a critic, said: "I was much  surprised to hear about the news of my being invited to serve as  a Hong Kong affairs adviser. This shows the Chinese Government  is enlightened, open-minded and ready to listen to different  views."    Chao How-chen, chairman of the Tsuen Wan district board and  a  member of the regional council, said Hong Kong is confronted  with a wide scope of complicated issues in the latter half of  the transitional period. The Chinese side should solicit views  from all social stratum.    He advised the Chinese Government to have regular meetings  and make in-depth discussion of Hong Kong affairs.    Wan Lam, deputy general-secretary of the new territories  communities, said, "As a member of the third batch of Hong Kong  affairs advisers, I will, as always, voice the opinions of  residents and fishermen in the new territories and do a bit for  the prosperity of Hong Kong."    He believes the Chinese Government is capable of making a  smooth transfer of power in Hong Kong even if no cooperation  from the British side.    Wang Siu-yee, member of the Kowloon city district board,  said, the most important thing for a Hong Kong affairs adviser  to do is to let the Chinese Government know what is happening in  Hong Kong and what the Hong Kong residents need.    For instance, he said, "A sharp gap between the rich and  poor  is a big issue in Hong Kong. I will forward views in this  respect to the Chinese Government."    In view of the fact that the Sino-British negotiation on the  1994-95 electoral arrangements in Hong Kong terminated, he  suggested that the preliminary work committee should speed up  work in various fields and work out a set of policies in the  interests of both Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland through  soliciting a wide spectrum of views.</p>

The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public Reference Branch. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicant's Representations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Applicant is an open-end management investment company that was organized as a corporation under the laws of Maryland. On November 3, 1980, applicant registered under the Act as an investment company, and filed a registration statement to register shares of its Money Market Portfolio under the Securities Act of 1933. The registration statement was declared effective on February 12, 1981, and the initial public offering commenced on or about that date. On February 22, 1982, post-effective amendment No. 3 to applicant's registration statement became effective and public offering of applicant's Government Securities Portfolio began on or about that date. On April 30, 1991, applicant issued to the holders of shares of its Money Market Portfolio shares of its Government Securities Portfolio with an equivalent net asset value. At such time, all assets and liabilities of the Money Market Portfolio became assets and liabilities of the Government Securities Portfolio. Since that time the Government Securities Portfolio has been applicant's only portfolio. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. On December 14, 1993, applicant's board of trustees approved an agreement and plan of reorganization (the ``Plan'') between applicant and Zweig Cash Fund, a series of Zweig Series Trust (the ``Trust''), a registered open-end management investment company. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> According to a proxy statement dated March 10, 1994, applicant's board of directors, including all of the disinterested directors, found that the reorganization would be in the bests interests of applicant's shareholders and that the interests of applicant's existing shareholders would not be diluted as a result of the reorganization. The Proxy statement also states that the board no longer considered applicant to be viable as a separate fund because of its relatively small asset base, high operating expenses, and correspondingly low yield absent an expense reimbursement from applicant's adviser. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3. On March 11, 1994, applicant distributed proxy materials to its shareholders. At a meeting on April 28, 1994, applicant's shareholders approved the reorganization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Pursuant to the Plan, on April 29, 1994, applicant transferred all of its assets to the Trust in exchange for Class M shares of Zweig Cash Fund. Applicant then distributed the shares of Zweig Cash Fund to its shareholders. After completion of the reorganization, each shareholder of applicant owned Class M shares of Zweig Cash Fund with the same aggregate net asset value as the shares of applicant owned by the shareholder immediately prior to the reorganization. On April 29, 1994, applicant had 92,292,699.36 shares outstanding, having an aggregate net asset value of $92,292,699.36 and a per share net asset value of $1.00. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Applicant's adviser, Zweig/Glaser Advisers, assumed all expenses in connection with the reorganization. Expenses totalled approximately $88,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. There are no securityholders to whom distributions in complete liquidation of their interests have not been made. Applicant has no debts or other liabilities that remain outstanding. Applicant is not a party to any litigation or administrative proceeding. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Applicant will file certificates of dissolution with Maryland authorities after the requested order is obtained. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Applicant is not now engaged, nor does it propose to engage, in any business activities other than those necessary for the winding up of its affairs. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Jonathan G.

			<p>BFN     [Text] San Jose, 2 Jun (AFP) -- Today, the local media  reported that Costa Rican Foreign Minister Fernando Naranjo  categorically rejected an eventual resumption of diplomatic  relations between Costa Rica and Cuba, although he stressed his  country "will voice the concerns" of the island within the OAS.    "Neither the president of the Republic, the foreign  minister,  nor the country has considered resuming diplomatic relations  with the government of Fidel Castro," Naranjo told the Costa  Rican newspaper LA NACION, while clarifying his government's  position on Cuba.    The Costa Rican Government has referred to the need to  reconsider the "Cuban case" within the OAS, from which Cuba was  suspended more than 30 years ago after the installation of a  military regime in Cuba.    According to the foreign minister, the government will push  for an in-depth analysis of the Cuban crisis by the nations of  the hemisphere, because "Cuba is currently facing an oppressive  political and economic situation."    "We are not going to become spokesmen for the regime of  Fidel  Castro, because we cannot agree with a government that does not  respect human rights," Naranjo reiterated to the domestic media.  He also stressed that the OAS "will have to heed the voice of  the Cuban people."    Naranjo is trying to thwart criticism from the opposition,  which has claimed that the government's position is the result  of "improvisation" because no changes have taken place in Cuba  to justify a shift in Costa Rica's policy toward the island.    Costa Rican President Jose Maria Figueres, who assumed power  on 8 May, has stated that changes in the international situation  demand a revision of Costa Rica's policy toward Cuba to "advance  the principles of human rights and democracy."</p>

			<p><P> September 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MORE TRAPS SET AFTER PREGNANT MEXFLY IS  FOUND  </P> <P> Los Angeles County agricultural officials reported Friday the trapping of a  pregnant Mexican fruit fly in Monrovia, sparking an intensified round of fly  trapping and ground pesticide spraying within 200 meters of the find.  </P> <P> The Mexfly was found Wednesday in a sapote tree on Grand Avenue. It is the  first found in the county since July 23, when a single immature male fly was  trapped in Watts.  </P> <P> Robert Atkins, deputy agricultural commissioner, said no aerial spraying is  planned. But the discovery of any additional flies could force agricultural  officials to order the controversial aerial malathion applications, he said.  </P> <P> After the Mediterranean fruit fly, Mexflies are considered the next most  dangerous fruit fly to agriculture.  </P></p>

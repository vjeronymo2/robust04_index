			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Telemetro Reports" newscast] </F>   [Text] The entire National Unity Mission [MUN] leadership  organized a news conference this morning to call on political  parties such as Papa Egoro and Solidarity, as well as civic  organizations and other business groups, to support an agreement  that would lead to urgently needed changes. In addition, MUN  called for an alliance that would continue not only up to the  elections, but all through the 1994-1999 period. It also called  for the government to adopt programs prepared jointly by the  parties and aimed at developing the country.    [Begin MUN presidential candidate David Guerra recording]  [words indistinct] has decided to make an urgent and direct call  to all those new political parties that decided to organize with  the intention of bringing some type of hope to this country. We  urge them to take on the historical commitment the country  demands and to come forward with their respective programs to  make up one single driving force, free of any politics, party  interests, resources or power dealings, and guided by the  socio-economic development this country -- which is shouting for  an opportunity -- desperately needs.    MUN would also like to call on every group, including all  those unions who have looked in vain for concrete answers to  their just and unpostponable demands, the teachers union, the  IRHE [Institute of Hydraulic Resources and Electrification] and  INTEL [National Institute of Telecommunications] workers,  transportation sector workers, doctors, students, nurses, and  all other citizens groups to abandon all neutral and silent  positions which, if they persist, will only bring more harm to  this country. We urge these groups to make up their minds today  to actively participate in an agreement that will determine this  country's fate.    We would like to call on the country's economic forces to  join this historic effort to save democracy and establish the  foundations of an administration that will really understand the  people's needs. This will ensure social stability, which is so  needed if the country expects to accomplish the economic  development it deserves.    MUN, as one of the new parties hinted, opens its doors to  that national agreement the country desperately needs. MUN is  aware that it is a big risk for any political party to  participate in the elections on its own. Although we are not  apprehensive about participating on our own, MUN is responsible  enough to acknowledge that every new party is obligated to  provide the country with the new answers and alternatives it  needs.    That is our communique and position at this time. [end  recording]</p>

In a statement it issued today, the party, which is closely  monitoring the painful events in Sudan, stressed to the whole  world that the Islamic Front's government is ultimately  responsible for what happened in the mosque and that the  government's claims that foreign elements were responsible for  the incident do not absolve it from this responsibility.    The statement added: Even if this accusation is true, who  opened the country for extremists, fanatics, and terrorists from  every corner to come and spread corruption, anxiety, and threats  in the country and the region?    The statement appealed to the international community and  world conscience to exert pressure on the Khartoum regime to  stop its evil actions against innocent citizens and called for  an immediate and urgent investigation. It also demanded  punishment for the responsible criminals and killers who can  only be the extremist groups that have been massed in the  country.</p>

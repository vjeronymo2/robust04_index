			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Marcos Portal Leon, minister of </F> basic industries, by reporter Jose Pena; place and date not  given; from the "Evening Information Review" newscast --  recorded]    [Text] [Pena] This is Radio Havana Cuba, sir, and we would  like to have your opinion on the trip that has taken you to  several European countries.    [Portal] This was an official trip to participate in the oil  conference in Norway, where Cuba had an opportunity to explain  the progress we are making in our country in the field of  petroleum. This includes exploration and drilling activities  carried out by Canadian, French, British, and Swedish  corporations. The activity is doing well, and we are interested  in getting the news to other countries and other oil companies.  Several companies showed some interest in Cuban geological  resources and its more promising exploration areas. We believe  we have attained our goals. In addition to this success, Cuba  has been admitted to the Oil Congress, which was another of our  objectives. We believe that this first leg of the journey was  highly successful.    We went to London to sign a contract with a second British  corporation for oil exploration in Cuba. The corporation is the  British Borneo Oil Corporation. This firm will join the first  one in the central region of the country, where there are  already several oil wells in operation. They have shown their  interest in moving forward with this specific project.    Participation of corporations such as these is based on  joint  risk concession. This means that there is money being invested  that will return when and if production begins. Such contracts  demonstrate the degree of trust these companies have in us and  the support they are receiving from Cuba in their investment  projects. This is why I constantly stress the risk they are  running by investing in our country. This is perhaps the most  significant part about the trip here.    [Pena] Several news agencies have reported on statements  regarding the success several Canadian companies are  experiencing here. Has anyone found oil in Cardenas?    [Portal] We completed the drilling phase at that site, and  we were testing the well. I learned here at the Congress that  one of the areas has proven positive. There is oil in that  seismic structure. This was truly reason for celebration. It  was welcomed as great news. It is true, according to official  announcements these two Canadian companies have made. It is  true, and we will continue our explorations and drilling to  determine the well's potential.    [Pena] What kind of guarantees can Cuba offer its foreign  investors regarding stability and professional ethics?    [Portal] As you may know, Cuba is ranked 29 in stability for  foreign investment among all of the countries of the world. This  is due to the social and political stability the country offers;  the technical and cultural advancement of our people, our  technicians, and our engineers; and the laws that protect  foreign investment. These, I believe, are advantages that  encourage people to invest in our country, despite the U.S.  trade embargo. This demonstrates just how independent the  companies and governments really are. It is important to us  because it diversifies our economy, preventing it from depending  on one country alone. All of this makes it important for us to  consolidate our economic independence.</p>

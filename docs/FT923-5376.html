			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Observer: The Hon thing 'My father has recently been made a life peer and I am wondering how I can best take advantage of my own status as 'The Hon'. I understand it is wrong for me to be addressed as 'The Hon' anywhere except on an envelope and I find this rather depressing. Can you advise me on how to exploit the title more fully,' asks an anonymous reader of The Spectator in a letter to Mary Killen, the magazine's agony aunt/etiquette referee. Surely this can't be a planted question by The Spectator's young editor, Dominic Lawson, son of the newly enobled Baron Lawson of Blaby.</p>

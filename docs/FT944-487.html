			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / Peso's fall packs a double whammy: Ted Bardacke looks at the heavy pressure devaluation will place on Mexico's corporate and banking sectors The 39 per cent devaluation of the Mexican peso since December 19 has the country's banks and big companies struggling to estimate how much the change will cost them, both in terms of 1994 profits and 1995 revenue. Many are frightened by what they see. Projected lower economic growth and high interest rates coupled with exchange rate losses on dollar-denominated debt will eat up the profits of many companies, even among those who may ultimately benefit from a weaker currency. But the banking system, which apparently will escape 1994 relatively unscathed, is the main long-term worry. Expensive domestic financing costs, slow economic growth and exchange rate exposure are nothing new to Mexican companies, At various times during the presidency of Mr Carlos Salinas, they suffered through similar conditions, such as suffocating interest rates in 1992, recession in 1993, and foreign exchange losses approaching Dollars 1bn in the first quarter alone of 1994. But these factors never coincided as strongly as they do now. 'We didn't get much sleep last week. And when we did sleep, we didn't sleep very well,' confesses Mr Jose Cavillo, finance director of Comercial Mexicana, the country's third largest retail chain. 'Profits have disappeared and all we can project for next year is uncertainty.' Only a few of the Mexican blue-chip companies whose shares trade on Wall Street will escape the effects of devaluation. In the league table (above) of the country's biggest corporate debtors, the lower a company appears, the greater its relative exchange rate loss from devaluation. Companies with already high export levels or dollar earnings, such as the telecommunications monopoly Telmex and the glassmaker Vitro, will not be hit that hard, although Telmex is projecting a fourth quarter after-tax exchange rate loss of approximately P1.3bn (Pounds 150m). Companies with low overall debt levels or inelastic demand for their products, such as the retailer Cifra and cornflour and tortilla group Maseca, are the best prepared to confront 1995. And while many companies say they are relieved that the devaluation took place at the end of 1994 so that they can start 1995 with a clean slate, the extreme situation at Comercial Mexicana shows what companies will have to deal with in the coming months. The fact that nearly all of Comercial Mexicana's P785m debt is in dollars, and that it has absolutely no foreign exchange earnings, is only the beginning. The company also expects low economic growth - if not outright recession - in 1995. Couple that with a projected decline in real wages as the government is unable to control prices as tightly as it controls the unions, and the outlook for any company is problematic at least. In general analysts say that consumer products will take a nosedive, while hotel and resort operators like Situr will weather the storm as property is valued in dollars and Mexico becomes more attractive to foreign tourists. Construction is the big question mark. Increased foreign direct investment may be offset by lower overall growth. But no matter what the immediate effect the devaluation has on individual companies, they are all worried about the increase they face in financing costs. Annual interest rates on peso loans from Mexican banks now stand at between 35 and 45 per cent, while foreign sources have dried up for the moment and will be expensive when they return. 'The margins at our stores can't cover more than an 18 per cent cost of capital. And dollars, if they exist, are going to cost significantly more than the 7 to 8 per cent we were getting before the devaluation,' Mr Cavillo says. 'We are going to have to watch our cash position very closely next year because cash may be all we have.' The consensus among financial analysts is that as companies lower their capital demands because of high interest rates and low economic growth, Mexican banks will see little or no growth in their loan portfolios. Yet this is just the start of the concerns about the banking system. 'Things that used to worry us only a few days ago, such as asset quality . . . and total loan growth of 10 per cent, could be just a pleasant dream of the past,' Mr Petru Vaduva of Bear Stearns says in Fasten Your Seat Belts, his analysis of the post-devaluation Mexican financial sector. Most loans in Mexico carry variable interest rates. As rates shoot up to 40 per cent and beyond, defaults are likely, especially in the consumer sector such as credit cards, mortgages and car loans. Mr Eduardo Garcia of Banca Serfin, Mexico's third largest bank, says: 'The quality of our loan portfolio is no doubt going to get worse. If people don't have money they simply aren't going to pay. We just don't know exactly how much of our portfolio is going to be in that position.' Dollars account for about 15 per cent of the liabilities of the Mexican banking system, so net income will suffer from exchange rate losses as well as from increased one-time charges for bad loans. But analysts say 1994 balance sheets should still look reasonably good and that the real warning signals are on capital and reserve levels. By law Mexican banks are required to put aside reserves not only for uncollectible loans but for potential bad loans as well. This will cost banks money in 1995, as would - if it now goes ahead - a planned increase in required capital from 8 per cent of assets to 9.5 per cent at the behest of the finance ministry. In addition, much of banks' current capital is either in the Mexican stock market - down more than 50 per cent in dollar terms so far in 1994 - or in long-term government securities, the value of which has also fallen heavily. Most banks will need new capital even to meet the current 8 per cent requirement. The problem, explains Serfin's Mr Garcia, is that not much capital is available. 'Forget the international capital markets,' he says. 'It will be a long time before they invest in Mexican banks again. And the national market is going to be pretty dry as well. Everybody with money is going to be using it to help their own businesses, not ours.'

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Chancellor Helmut Kohl has called  for a general stocktaking in society at the forum "Safeguarding  Germany as a business and investment location" in Bonn today.  Even an improved economic situation, which is already emerging,  cannot alone remove the structural failings of past years, the  chancellor stressed. Important reforms, such as the reform of  the railways and the postal service, have been delayed for  decades. At the same time, during the good years unions and  employers nowhere near managed to exploit to the full the legal  scope for more flexible working hours and longer machine running  times.    Kohl described as a priority "completing economic and social  unity in Germany." The people in eastern Germany today are  going through a "difficult and far-reaching structural change at  a breathtaking pace." Much less radical changes in western  Germany would put people very much on the defensive, he said.</p>

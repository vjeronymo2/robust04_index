			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / International Company News: New chief at Credit Suisse CREDIT SUISSE, Switzerland's third-largest bank, has chosen a young investment banker to be its next chief executive. Mr Josef Ackermann, 44, replaces Mr Robert Jeker, who is leaving the bank 'on the best of terms' to become managing director of Anova, Nueva and Unotec, Mr Stephan Schmidheiny's three investment and holding companies. The shuffle comes only three months after a similar change of command at Swiss Bank Corporation. Both banks earlier this year saw their credit ratings downgraded a notch from the cherished triple A by Moody's, the rating service. Mr Ackermann entered Credit Suisse in 1978, and has worked in corporate banking in New York and in investment banking at Credit Suisse First Boston in London. Mr Jeker's departure helps ease the succession at the bank. Mr Rainer Gut, the 60-year-old chairman, intends to stay until the retirement age of 68.</p>

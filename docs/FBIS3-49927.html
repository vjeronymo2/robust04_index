			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sofia, January 11 (BTA) -- Parliament's December  declaration stating Bulgaria's readiness to join NATO is a  parliamentary act which sends a positive signal of this  country's new foreign policy, reads a letter from Bulgarian  President Zhelyu Zhelev to National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur  Yordanov, received at BTA this afternoon. The president  stresses the importance of the unanimous approval of the  declaration as a sign of a mature stand on vital national  security problems in the post-communist era and of the political  course toward integration into Europe. Parliament passed the  declaration on December 21, just before its Christmas recess.    In connection with the NATO summit on January 10-11 and the  alliance's decisions on its relations with partner countries,  the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry today said that the strategic  objective of Bulgaria's new policy is to provide external  guarantees for national security and integrate into European and  Euro-Atlantic structures. There is broad public support and a  consensus among the parliamentary forces on a future full  membership in NATO and the Western European Union, reflected in  the National Assembly declaration.    The ministry was pleased to note the willingness to open  toward the security issues facing Eastern Europe and admit new  members in the future manifested at the summit. We hope this  process will be based on equality, taking into account the  lawful security interests of partner states and providing and  defining security guarantees in the future, says the declaration.    The ministry described the Partnership for Peace Initiative  as a radically new step in the relations between NATO and  partner states. It gives an equal start to all countries,  seeking closer ties and integration into the alliance's  structures, preventing a feeling of isolation, the declaration  says.    We see the implementation of the initiative as a process and  as the first stage along the road to a full NATO membership for  partner states on an equality basis. An essential element of  the implementation of partnership for peace is the promotion of  political cooperation, which will ensure equal participation for  the partners in the respective NATO bodies and pave their way to  sharing in political decision-making within the alliance.    We believe that consultations with NATO in case of a direct  security threat to any Central or East European country is one  of the most farsighted and useful forms of political cooperation  within the partnership for peace initiative, the declaration  goes on to say. Bulgaria strongly favours a further promotion  of its practical cooperation with the North Atlantic Alliance  and its member states and with the partner states of the North  Atlantic Cooperation Council, it says.    "A membership in NATO is the only guarantee for this  country's national security," said Asparukh Panov MP of the  Union of Democratic Forces (SDS), upon his return from a meeting  of the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly yesterday [10  January]. According to SDS's supreme leadership, the cabinet  failed to make use of the parliament's December 21 declaration,  by stating more firmly this country's desire to become a NATO  member and by publicizing the parliamentary decision via  diplomatic channels. "NATO gave the green light for a future  admission of East European countries to its structures through  the Partnership for Peace Plan. The strange thing is that none  of the alliance's documents names Bulgaria," Asparukh Panov told  journalists today.    "I expected nothing more. We have to be realists," Dimitur  Yonchev MP of the Bulgarian Socialist Party told national  television's Repercussions Show this evening. He supports  Bulgaria's balanced declaration on the issue. The Partnership  for Peace Initiative contains too many if's for a language like  English, said Yonchev. He shares the view the plan was designed  to gain time.    "No one is ahead of us and the initiative offers enormous  opportunities to Bulgaria," said Defence Minister Valentin  Aleksandrov in televised interview.</p>

			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Financial Times Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (12): Small stocks steal the limelight in an 'anaemic' US recovery THE BIG story of the final quarter of 1992 was small stocks - which put in a strong performance while much of the rest of the US equity markets stood virtually still. Between October and the end of December, the Dow Jones Industrial Average managed a paltry 0.9 per cent gain, to end the year at 3,271.66. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 fared a little better, rising 4.3 per cent to 435.72, but it was the Nasdaq composite index of secondary stocks, the main measure of small stock performance, which grabbed the spotlight, soaring 16 per cent during the quarter to 676.95. Although the Nasdaq was aided by exceptional gains from a few big technology stocks, such as Intel and Microsoft, the main reason the index did so well was because small company stocks were in heavy demand from investors. They offered what cyclical and leading industrial stocks did not: an opportunity for growth. Bigger stocks fell victim to the economic circumstances. Although there were an increasing number of signs during the latter stages of the period that economic growth was finally picking up pace, the recovery remained (in President Bush's words) 'anaemic' throughout the second half of 1992. Consequently, many investors who had bought cyclical stocks in the early part of the year, in expectation of a strong economic rebound in late 1992, began switching during the last quarter into smaller stocks, which had fallen sharply in the spring and summer and which were beginning to look inexpensive by the autumn. The early stages of the final quarter was a particularly difficult period for some of the Dow's most prestigious stocks. IBM, Merck, Westinghouse and United Technologies reported disappointing third-quarter earnings, while General Motors was plagued by turmoil among senior management and seemingly never-ending restructurings. The presidential election, meanwhile, was nearing its conclusion. Ultimately, it had little real impact on stock prices, primarily because the proposed economic policies of Bill Clinton did not frighten investors. By election day, a Democratic victory had been priced into the markets. Investors even welcomed some of his plans for boosting the economy with increased government spending, although talk of introducing an aggressive fiscal stimuli package in early 1993 sent chills through the bond market, which was worried about the ballooning federal deficit and a possible revival of inflation. These concerns, however, did not particularly trouble the equity markets, which by the final weeks of the quarter were posting sold gains in the wake of a string of moderately positive economic reports. A mini post-election boom in consumer confidence also gave stocks a modest lift. Throughout the quarter, the markets were buoyed by heavy inflows of cash into equities, which helped keep daily trading volume exceptionally heavy. A record Dollars 9.9bn went into stock mutual funds during November alone as investors continued to look to equities for higher returns. In Canada, the Toronto Stock Exchange composite index ended a bad year on an upbeat note, rising 1.6 per cent in the final quarter to end at 3,350.44. Sentiment was helped by the voters' decision to reject the government's plan to include Quebec in a new Canadian constitution, and by the improving economic outlook. Concern about the slowing economy and higher interest rates failed to unsettle equity investors in Mexico, where they celebrated the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement in late December by helping the Bolsa index jump 32.5 per cent to 1,759.44.</p>

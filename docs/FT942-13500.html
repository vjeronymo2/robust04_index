			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Patients' Charter goals 'unknown' Most people have no knowledge of their rights under the government's Patients' Charter, says a poll commissioned by the Royal College of Nursing. Seven in 10 had heard of the charter, but only a handful could name any of the standards of care they can expect. In the poll of 2,000 people, only 2 per cent believed the charter had anything to do with raising standards of care.</p>

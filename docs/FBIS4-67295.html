			<p>CSO     [Text] Bombay, March 31--The narcotics cell of the Bombay  police last week seized a massive factory manufacturing  methaqualone from which the drug Mandrax is made.    This is the first time in India that such a large  methaqualone factory has been seized, although experts believe  that India is the largest producer of Mandrax.    According to the chief of the narcotics cell, DCP [Deputy  Commissioner of Police] Rahul Sur, Mandrax tablets and  methaqualone powder each weighing 100 kg and collectively valued  at Rs 20 lakhs were seized from the factory along with a Maruti  car.    The factory, masquerading as Ambala Organic Chemicals Pvt  Ltd  in an industrial estate in Kadhi, Mehsana district, Gujarat, was  spread over 10,000 sq feet and had five boilers 12-feet high. It  is believed to have been in operation for the past nine months.    Six persons were arrested in this connection: Nitin Khimji  Bhanushali (33) of Neelam Nagar, Mulund; Nayan Jetha Bhimji  Bhanushali (28) of Sarvodaya Nagar, Mulund; Harish Kantibhai  Patel (35) of Nadiad, Gujarat, and Manehdra Singh Sandhu (41),  Kinit Jayantilal Amin (33), Amit Jayantibhai Patel (26), all of  Ahmedabad.    However, Prem Shetty, one of the biggest manufacturers of  Mandrax tablets in India, who had advanced the money through  hawala for the purchse of the factory, is believed to have fled  India.</p>

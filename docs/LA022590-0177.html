			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A 14-0 REBEL RUN KNOCKS DOWN LOUISVILLE;  </P> <P> UNLV: CARDINALS MISS THEIR FIRST SIX SHOTS AS TARKANIAN'S THIN SQUAD WINS ITS  10TH IN A ROW AND COMPLETES PERFECT HOME SEASON, 91-81.  </P> <P> A perfect opening six minutes Saturday against Louisville capped a perfect home  season for fourth-ranked Nevada Las Vegas.  </P> <P> The Rebels used a 14-0 spurt to open the game and never trailed en route to a  91-81 victory over the No. 16 Cardinals that ended UNLV's home season with a  17-0 record, the team's best.  </P> <P> "This is not an easy place to win even playing a bad team, and they're a very  good team," Louisville Coach Denny Crum said. "They just jumped on us real  quick and got a big lead on us."  </P> <P> UNLV's stifling defense forced three turnovers and Louisville missed its first  six shots as the Cardinals dug themselves into a hole from which they couldn't  recover.  </P> <P> "The pressure defense early was incredible," UNLV Coach Jerry Tarkanian said.  "They never had a chance to get in their offense early."  </P> <P> Larry Johnson had 22 points and 15 rebounds and all five UNLV starters scored  in double figures as UNLV won its 10th game in a row.  </P> <P> Rebel guard Greg Anthony, wearing a mask to protect a jaw he fractured four  games ago, came back after being knocked to the floor in a jarring collision  during the opening minute to add 16 points.  </P> <P> "I just had to make up my mind to go out there and play physical," Anthony  said. "I've been knocked down a few times so I don't really worry about it now.  I expect to be hit."  </P> <P> Johnson scored four of his points during an 8-0 run by UNLV with five minutes  remaining that broke open a 73-69 game.  </P> <P> Center Felton Spencer scored 24 points before fouling out with 2:43 left to  lead Louisville, which was playing without its leading scorer, Jerome Harmon,  suspended for two games because of academic problems.  </P> <P> "If we hadn't got the ball to Spencer, we'd have gotten beat by 30 points,"  Crum said.  </P> <P> UNLV took advantage of foul trouble by Louisville to score 12 of its last 18  points on free throws and pull away to the victory. UNLV outscored Louisville,  18-5, at the foul line in the second half.  </P> <P> UNLV, beset by injuries and playing its 10th game in 24 days, used only two  reserves for a total of 22 minutes.  </P> <P> "I found myself praying for the game to end," Anthony said. "I was just  fatigued."  </P> <P> Tarkanian said the grueling schedule caused his team to let down defensively  after the opening minutes.  </P> <P> "It's incredible how many games we played without any rest," Tarkanian said.  "We played with so much courage, so much heart. We have nothing left in us."  </P> <P> UNLV, which ends its regular season with three Big West Conference games on the  road, improved to 24-4. Louisville, losing two in a row for the first time this  season, fell to 20-7.  </P> <P> LaBradford Smith added 20 points for the Cardinals. Anderson Hunt had 17 and  Stacey Augmon scored 16 for UNLV.  </P> <P> Louisville trailed by five at halftime and kept within reach of the Runnin'  Rebels, drawing to within 68-65 on a basket by Cornelius Holden with 8:10  remaining.  </P> <P> UNLV answered with five points in a row, however, and the Cardinals were able  to get no closer.  </P> <P> After UNLV's opening spurt, Tony Kimbro's jumper sparked an 11-2 spurt that  pulled the Cardinals within 16-11.  </P> <P> UNLV stretched the lead to as many as 13 points midway through the half, but  Louisville scored 10 of the last 13 points of the half to pull within 42-37 at  halftime.  </P></p>

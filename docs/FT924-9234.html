			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Hanson pulls out of RHM contest HANSON, the Anglo/US conglom-erate, said yesterday it would not increase its Pounds 790m offer for Ranks Hovis McDougall, effectively withdrawing from the bid contest for the UK milling baking and grocery products group. The decision gives Tomkins, the British conglomerate with a rival recommended Pounds 935m bid, a clear run at RHM. It also raises some awkward questions for Hanson. Regarded as the consummate deal maker of the 1980s, it has failed to pull off a number of big deals in the 1990s. Hanson's bid will not be formally withdrawn until November 13, the first closing date for its original offer. But unless Tomkins unexpectedly withdraws by the end of next week, another potential target will have slipped through the hands of Lord Hanson, the eponymous chairman. Over the past two years Hanson has pulled back from bids for PowerGen, the electricity generator, Imperial Chemical Industries and Canary Wharf, the troubled property development. Hanson's bid for RHM was the first time it had gone hostile since 1986 - when it successfully took over Imperial Tobacco. It will be only the second time it has lost a hostile takeover battle. Mr Derek Bonham, Hanson chief executive, said: 'It is only 1992. We are still looking at many deals. Wait and see what happens. But frankly, our shareholders come first: we do not overpay.' Hanson decided not to increase its offer for RHM after receiving a reply from RHM's financial adviser, Morgan Grenfell, detailing information passed to Tomkins. A Hanson adviser said Morgan Grenfell's letter did not reveal any significant information on RHM that Hanson did not know when it made its hostile bid last month. 'If Hanson thought it was worth 220p a share in October it could hardly say it was worth more than the 260p plus a dividend of 9.54p from RHM (being offered by Tomkins) the following month,' said the adviser. Mr Bonham said that after looking at all the numbers Hanson could not see how RHM was worth the price being offered by Tomkins. 'We took the view that RHM's baking problem was not just cyclical but structural as well. The brands were poorly based while half the volume of the grocery products are in RHM labels which do not carry a premium.' Lex, Page 24; Reputation on the line, Page 26</p>

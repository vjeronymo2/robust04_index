			<p>BFN     [Text] Gaza/London--Quds Press and news agencies--The  Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, has lauded the  Jordanian-Palestinian cohesion, and stressed that it will  maintain this genuine historic cohesion.    In a statement issued by its military wing, known as  'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam Battalions, and distributed in Gaza City  yesterday, Hamas warned the Israeli Government against expanding  the Palestinian-Israeli conflict following its claims against  the Jordanian position.    In an amazing step, Hamas said that it is ready to reexamine  its policy of attacking Israeli military and civilian targets,  on the condition that the Israeli prime minister, his army, and  government completely stop killing unarmed Palestinians. It  pointed out that the objective of the recent 'Afula and Hadera  operations, which targeted a group of soldiers and settlers, and  in which some civilians were injured, was to deter the Zionist  aggression against our people, and legitimate revenge for the  martyrs of the abhorrent Hebron massacre. However, in a  statement issued by its political bureau yesterday, of which  Quds Press received a copy, it said that this is not a constant  policy by the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam Battalions, but an  extraordinary policy imposed by the Israeli enemy government.    The statement added: We, in Hamas, as we have always said,  we are not against the principle of peace, but the peace  proposed by the enemy government is not peace, but an  entrenchment of occupation.    In a clear response to the Israeli criticism of Jordan, it  said that the Movement reiterates its concern for the security  and stability of all states where the movement's political and  economic representatives reside, who operate in accordance with  the recognized laws in these states. The movement is also  concerned not to give the enemy any justification to exert  pressure on any of these states.    The statement said that any peace in the region must be  based  on Israel's withdrawal from the occupied territories, the  removal of settlements, and the holding of free elections in the  West Bank and Gaza Strip to elect our people's representatives  and leadership. It added that the elected leadership is the one  that will decide all the consequent steps and future of the  cause.    In a statement distributed in Gaza, Hamas stressed that its  units "had abided by carrying out its operations within the  known borders of Palestine. Our leadership was committed to  planning and carrying out its operations only inside the  occupied Palestinian territories."    The statement added: "If the Israeli Government seeks to  expand the arena of the conflict and decides to move against the  Hamas Movement's officials or offices abroad, then it will  consider this as the beginning of a war in which Israeli blood,  interests, and gatherings of Jewish communities all over the  globe will be legitimate [targets], and we will reply more  harshly to any act of aggression."    The statement emphasized: The "Israeli Government knows  better than anyone that the Islamic Resistance Movement has long  and strong arms in all the world states. We have thus far  abided by the rules of the game in the conflict arena. However,  If the Israeli Government violates the rules of the game, then  this government and the Jewish people will be first to pay the  price."    The Hamas Movement called on its loyalists to declare a  state  of "mobilization and the highest degree of alertness."</p>

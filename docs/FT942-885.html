			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / The Markets: Diamond record possible - Commodities First-half sales by De Beers' Central Selling Organisation, which controls at least 80 per cent of world trade in rough (uncut) diamonds, are reported on Wednesday and are widely expected to match or even exceed the record USDollars 2.54bn achieved in the first six months of 1993. That does not mean, however, that the diamond market is in sparkling condition. De Beers is being pressed on two fronts: By its customers, who cut and polish gem diamonds and by the Russians, who supply about 25 per cent of the stones that are sold by the cartel. The big customers are complaining that their profit margins have been squeezed so hard during the past two years that they are now practically non-existent. The CSO is to meet a delegation to discuss these problems. The CSO drastically reduced the number of diamonds it made available at its two most recent 'sights' or sales, a move welcomed by the cutters and polishers. Meanwhile, difficult negotiations in Moscow about a new contract between Russia and the CSO will continue in Moscow next month. Some Russians are pressing for big changes and it is unlikely that agreement will be reached quickly. Mr Mark Cockle, editor of CRU International's Diamantaire newsletter, says: 'The likely outcome of the talks - having to choose between terms that threaten to push Russia out of the cartel or alternatively favour Russia to the point of antagonising South Africa and Botswana mining interests - is one De Beers' officials want to postpone as long as possible.' On Wednesday the International Wheat Council's annual World Grain Conference will be held in London. Speakers include Mr Eugene Moos, US undersecretary of agriculture, Mr Zhou Mingchen, chairman of China's Ceroilfoods, and Mr Warren Lavorel, deputy director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.</p>

			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Arts: Nature, nurture and nastiness - Television / A look at the key questions in the debate about violence on our screens Q: Now that Professor Elizabeth Newson and 24 other 'experts' have offered the opinion that there is a link between violent crime and video nasties, is it not time that television and the broadcasters began to accept some responsibility? A: Blaming broadcasters and television is about as sensible as blaming plastics manufacturers on the grounds that cassettes are made from their materials. Video nasties may be viewed via television sets but they are produced by the cinema industry and rented out by video shops. They are not made by broadcasters, nor shown on British television channels. Surely these 'experts' are only confirming, finally, what anyone with common sense could always see: that many violent deeds committed in real life are imitations of deeds in video nasties or on television programmes. This ignores the fact that mankind has always been violent. Were there no murders before television? No wars? Doubtless Ronald Reagan's would-be assassin did indeed copy the methods he saw in a video, but that is not to say that without the video he would not have attempted the assassination. What about all the other people who saw that video; why didn't they try to assassinate Reagan? Presumably because they were not murderous lunatics. Did Abraham Lincoln's assassin copy a video? What about the James Bulger case which finally drove Professor Newson to declare her change of mind? What about it? No evidence in that case was ever given to show that either of the two 10-year-old boys found guilty of the murder had seen a video nasty. A comment from the judge to the effect that the father of one boy had rented many video nasties has been widely publicised by people who desperately want to blame something other than man's violent nature for man's violence. What about 11-year-old Mary Hayley Bell - who killed two boys aged four and three in 1968 - did she watch videos? What about the princes in the tower - would they have survived but for the videos watched by their killers? You cannot pretend that it is sheer coincidence that violent deeds are done so often by people who watch a lot of violent videos. Of course it is not coincidence, any more than it is coincidence that Steve Cram, Sebastian Coe and Steve Ovett all watched countless athletics videos and all became top athletes. Would you attribute their prowess to their abnormal intake of videos or argue that they watch the videos because they have an abnormal interest in athletics? Videos cannot make you a champion any more than videos can make you a murderer, though they may give you ideas about technique: a longer stride pattern, a sawn-off shotgun and a black balaclava. If you doubt this and believe that screen violence really can turn non-murderers into murderers, would you apply this to yourself or merely to everyone else? Given all the money that advertisers spend on commercials, how can you argue that screen violence does not 'sell' violence? Do advertisers sell sausages to vegetarians? Cars to non-drivers? Tampons to men? Television commercials sell products to those already predisposed to buy. They are largely concerned with winning market share, not with converting people, which is extremely difficult. Furthermore, the intent of the advertiser is of paramount importance, and if programme makers intended to 'sell violence' and used all the tricks of the trade to make it appear attractive then we should, indeed, be in trouble. To the extent that modern programme makers have lost sight of the traditional black hat/white hat morality and are themselves confused, we are in trouble. That, however, stems from a confusion in society generally and not from a box of electronic tricks in the corner of the sitting room. If you doubt the crucial importance of the intent behind the image, you have to explain why impressionable young (or old) people don't rush around crucifying one another, given that the most familiar violent image in the Christian world for the last few hundred years has been that of a man nailed to a cross. However sceptical you may be about cause and effect, it is surely a good idea to control children's access to extremely violent material? Yes, just as it is a good idea to control children's access to pans of boiling chip fat and bottles of weedkiller. Professor Newson and her colleagues may have changed their opinions, yet the existence of a direct causal connection between screen images and crime is still arguable, whereas we know for a fact that chip fat and weedkiller are frequent killers. Yet they are not banned: we continue to allow a free market in chip fat and weedkiller because people want them, and adults are expected to be responsible for protecting children. The same principle should apply to violent screen material, from King Lear to Driller Killer. Has there been any progress in this debate over the past 20 years? Yes. Even the most bigoted now seem to have stopped tacking the word 'sex' onto the word 'violence'.</p>

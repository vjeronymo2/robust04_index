Whose  sinful hands have once again been extended in less than 48 hours  to assassinate a new group of worshipers praying to God at the  Juniyah church, exactly as their brothers were doing two days  ago at the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron? Who are those involved in  killing the worshipers inside the houses of worship? Who are  those who skillfully dissociate themselves from responsibility  and hold others responsible?    Can anyone doubt the fact that there is a clear link between  the Hebron massacre, perpetrated at the Ibrahimi Mosque during  the dawn prayers, and the Sunday mass massacre at the Sayyidat  al-Najat church in Juniyah? What objectives does this clear  link between the two crimes conceal? The answers do not need  much thought: It is the hands of rancor, extremism, and  terrorism. These are the same hands that were created, planted,  and sponsored by Israel in the region, giving rise to vehement  rancor at the hands of ruthless and fanatic settlers. Thus,  these settlers shed blood in a sacred place in Hebron.    These hands today dealt a treacherous new and mean blow to  the Juniyah church through cheap agents who sold themselves,  their conscience and homeland, and the blood of their brothers  to the enemy at a cheap price.    No doubt, Israel is the party behind today's explosion in  Juniyah. It seeks to achieve objectives that are known to  everyone. Foremost among these objectives is to conceal the  Hebron massacre and create an atmosphere of sedition and  disturbance in Lebanon. Israel is the only party interested in  fomenting such seditions, so they will spread not only in  Lebanon but in the entire region, as well. Only in such an  atmosphere can Israel conceal its crimes and its terrorism and  exploit this situation in order to achieve its schemes designed  to control Arab land and resources and this nation's destiny.    However, today's explosion cannot conceal those who are  behind such crimes. In fact, today's crime urges the  international community and the world to assume a greater  responsibility for confronting the chain of Israeli crimes and  massacres and taking deterrent measures to curb Zionist  terrorism. We reiterate that this terrorism threatens the  situation in the whole region with explosion.    Will the world contemplate this issue, make up its mind, and  end Zionist terrorism and aggression before it is too late?</p>

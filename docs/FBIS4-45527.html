			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Santa Fe de Bogota Emisoras Caracol  Network in Spanish at 1519 GMT on 22 June broadcasts live in  progress, from an undisclosed location, a 62-minute news  conference by Andres Pastrana, former Colombian presidential  candidate of the New Democratic Force party, with unidentified  domestic and foreign reporters.    At 1519 GMT, Pastrana begins by saying "the president-elect  is lying when he tried to implicate the campaign of Andres  Pastrana and Luis Fernando Ramirez in drug trafficking  activities." He then adds: "That is why I convened this news  conference; to set the record straight."    At 1521 GMT, Pastrana comments on audio cassette recordings  of individuals allegedly linking his and President-elect  Samper's presidential campaigns with drug money. He then reads  a statement, which begins by noting that "on 15 June at the  Intercontinental Hotel in Cali, when leaving a banquet offered  by Valle del Cauca political leaders, a person delivered to me a  tape saying it was important." Pastrana then gives a chronology  of the events leading up to the disclosure of the cassette  recordings. Pastrana later reads a letter he sent to Samper  asking him to rebut charges drug money was being used for his  electoral campaign if there was nothing to hide, "a thing he did  not do."    At 1527 GMT, Pastrana explains he refused to use this  recording for electoral purposes. He states: "Knowing about  this tape before the elections, the cassette was not used for  electoral purposes." At 1530 GMT, Pastrana begins playing a  portion of the tape recording, with poor reception, of two  unidentified individuals suggesting that Pastrana's and Samper's  campaigns received drug money. At 1531 GMT, Pastrana stops  playing the recording to note that his campaign treasurer had  turned down an offer, conveyed by journalist Alberto Giraldo,  from "some people in Cali who wished to donate money for the  campaign of Andres Pastrana." Pastrana then continues playing  the recording of two unidentified men discussing possible  campaign contributions.    At 1547 GMT, after playing the recording, Pastrana says: "At  no time does the recording refer to donations to my campaign."  He then says he received a call from the prosecutor general  asking him to confirm the delivery of the tape to President  Gaviria, and he says he will confirm this delivery. Pastrana  states that "from the tapes it cannot be inferred that my  campaign requested or received offers of drug money." At 1600  GMT, Pastrana states: "If it is proven that the Colombian  president-elect's campaign received funds from drug traffickers,  he must relinquish the mandate he received from the people;  otherwise his credentials will be distorted."    At 1552 GMT, when asked if he is asking Dr. Samper to  resign,  Pastrana asserts: "If it is confirmed that drug money was used  for his campaign, he should be ready to resign the presidency as  I would be if I won the election and if my campaign had received  drug money." When asked how can he assure he did not receive  Cartel money, Pastrana says: "Do you think I would go to the  president of the republic to tell him, here is a tape that  compromises me, please investigate me." At 1555 GMT, he  continues: "Three days before the elections I made a clear  proposal. After learning about the tape I said I was willing to  resign if it were proven that there was drug money in my  campaign."    At 1605 GMT, Pastrana explains he is not hesitant to  surrender the accounting books of his campaign, adding: "Those  books are always open. In my case, we have not only turned the  books over to the supervisory commission but also to the  National Electoral Council, which closes out electoral campaign  books." When asked if he would be willing to cooperate with the  Samper administration after it is confirmed Samper did not  receive drug money, Pastrana says: "I personally do not hope to  participate in the Samper administration."    At 1613 GMT, Pastrana asserts: "No one in the world can say  my campaign was funded by drug money." When asked about General  Maza's involvement in this episode, Pastrana responds: "This is  worrisome; there are statements in the recording that are very  worrisome. It is up to the public to assess these statements."    Responding to an indistinct question at 1615 GMT, Pastrana  states: "More than thinking about a deterioration of relations  with the United States, the country demands that this matter be  clarified." When questioned if he is ready to lead a movement  to force the resignation of a corrupt president similar to those  in Brazil and Venezuela, Pastrana says: "I would rather wait  for the results of the investigation."    Pastrana concludes his news conference at 1622 GMT by  stating  that he has received death threats from the drug cartels and by  answering questions on the upcoming soccer match between  Colombia and the United States.</p>

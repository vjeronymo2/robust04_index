			<p><P> April 23, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> SEX SELECTION IN TEST TUBE  </P> <P> Scientists at Hammsmith Hospital in London say they have been able to select  3-day-old test-tube embryos that are destined to become girls and implant them  in women, including two who are expecting twins this summer. Further research  might provide a way to screen out embryos that would be expected to develop  serious genetic diseases, removing the prospect of abortions in those cases,  researchers said.  </P> <P> The study was aimed at producing female babies in cases where a male could  inherit one of the 200 serious genetic diseases that affect only males, said  researcher Alan Handyside.  </P> <P> The embryo analysis involves collecting eggs from a woman, fertilizing them in  a test tube and letting them grow to eight-cell embryos. A single cell is  removed from each embryo to see if it contains a bit of genetic material that  indicates the presence of a Y chromosome, which would mean the embryo is  destined to become a boy.  </P></p>

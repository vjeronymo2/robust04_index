			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> 'SUPERQUAKE' MAY LIE AHEAD ALMOST ANYWHERE IN U.S.  </P> <P> The horror that rocked Alaska 25 years ago inevitably will happen again  somewhere, as huge plates of the Earth's crust regularly slip and produce  monstrous earthquakes.  </P> <P> "There's absolute certainty a great quake will hit Earth somewhere every few  years, and almost as much certainty that every 20 to 30 years we'll have one of  the supergiant quakes, as in Chile in 1960 and Alaska in 1964," said John  Nance, author of "On Shaky Ground: An Invitation to Disaster."  </P> <P> In the United States, Alaska and perhaps the Pacific Northwest are most prone  to superquakes, but California and the eastern half of the United States have  trembled violently in somewhat smaller temblors -- and will do so again.  </P> <P> "It's dangerous arrogance for any of us, wherever we live, to assume the  problem is isolated to any particular region," Nance said by telephone from  Tacoma, Wash. "We stand united in the shadow of seismic peril."  </P> <P> The quake that shook south-central Alaska on March 27, 1964, measured 8.5 on  the Richter scale and 9.2 on the "moment magnitude" scale, which seismologists  say is the most accurate measure of large temblors.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rare 'Supergiant' Quake  </P> <P> That makes it the second-largest quake ever recorded, and one of only three  "supergiant" quakes this century.  </P> <P> The largest was of magnitude 9.5 on May 21, 1960. It generated a tidal wave  that killed 5,700 people in Chile. The third superquake was of magnitude 9.0 on  April 11, 1952, on the Kamchatka Peninsula of the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Alaska's giant quake relieved so much underground stress that a repeat in the  same location is unlikely for 300 to 1,200 years, said Christopher Stevens, a  U.S. Geological Survey seismologist in Menlo Park, Calif.  </P> <P> A less powerful but still dangerous quake could hit the same area much sooner,  said USGS seismologist Stuart Nishenko in Golden, Colo.  </P> <P> Supergiant quakes and great ones -- beyond magnitude 8 -- are most likely along  the edges of the enormous, constantly drifting plates of rock that make up the  Earth's crust.  </P> <P> One danger zone is the Circum-Pacific "ring of fire," which includes the  Pacific coasts of South, Central and North America, Japan and New Zealand. The  other zone stretches from the Mediterranean through Turkey, Iran, the southern  Soviet Union and into Asia.  </P> <P> Superquakes happen only in certain parts of these belts, called subduction  zones, where thinner crustal plates beneath the oceans smash into and dive  beneath thicker continental plates. The diving plate often hangs up on the  overlying plate for decades or centuries, allowing tremendous stress to build.  </P> <P> At 5:36 p.m. on Good Friday in 1964, such stress reached the breaking point 12  1/2 miles beneath Alaska's Prince William Sound. A chunk of the Pacific plate,  hundreds of square miles in area, jerked spasmodically under Alaska and the  North American plate.  </P> <P> There is potential for similar sudden movement farther south.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lurks Off Coast  </P> <P> "A (future) quake equally destructive to Alaska 1964 lurks only a few dozen  miles off the Oregon-Washington coast, ready to lash an area from northern  Vancouver Island all the way to Northern California," killing thousands, Nance  said.  </P> <P> Although superquakes happen only along subduction zones, lesser temblors can  occur within plates, such as in the interior of China and the eastern half of  the United States.  </P> <P> Three "intraplate" quakes, estimated at up to 8.6 on the Richter scale, were  centered on a fault deep beneath New Madrid, Mo., in 1811 and 1812. They killed  several dozen people, temporarily reversed the flow of the Mississippi River  and rang church bells in Boston.  </P> <P> Robert Ketter, director of the National Center for Earthquake Engineering  Research, has estimated that a modern New Madrid quake would kill thousands.  </P> <P> "The Eastern Seaboard is in more danger than the West because they are  abysmally unprepared," with building standards far less stringent than  California's, Nance said.  </P></p>

			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Clinton promises aircraft subsidies PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday gave strong support to the US-EC pact governing Airbus but promised to counter European subsidies with 'significant' government investment in new technology for the next generation of US aircraft. Speaking at a news conference with President Francois Mitterrand, he stressed that 'the (Airbus) agreement must be honoured'. He was echoing his trade representative, Mr Mickey Kantor, who appeared before the Senate finance committee yesterday to testify about a range of trade issues. Under questioning, Mr Kantor rejected a suggestion that the US would bring a countervailing duty case against the EC. However, he complained about EC accounting practices. The US had not had access to information on repayment by Airbus of government loans, he said, adding that if the loans were not being repaid, the US might withdraw from the pact. On the subject of Japan, Mr Kantor said the administration was enthusiastic about a proposal to address the US deficit by negotiating a series of specific trade targets in order to boost US manufactured exports. Failure to achieve these 'temporary quantitative indicators' within an agreed time span would result either in further negotiated measures or US sanctions. On other subjects he suggested: The negotiating agenda had been set for the side agreements on labour and the environment necessary to implement the North American Free Trade Agreement by January 1, 1994. The entire package might be sent to Congress by early summer. Blame for the failure to conclude a Gatt agreement rested on 'the three-year deadlock between the rest of the world and the EC over agriculture, and Japan, which took the opportunity of the stalemate to 'avoid contributing meaningfully' to the talks.</p>

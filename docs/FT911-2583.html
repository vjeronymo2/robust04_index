			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Eggs proposal THE UK Egg Producers' Association called yesterday for a government review of the 'pointless' compulsory slaughter of hens. It said there had been a steep drop in cases of salmonella food poisoning. More than 2m birds have been killed since controls were introduced at the height of concern in the late 1980s about salmonella in eggs.</p>

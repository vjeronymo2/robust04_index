			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Telephone union says it is branching out THE National Communications Union is making progress in extending its membership beyond BT and the Post Office and has won a foothold in the cable TV industry and at Butlin's, the leisure company, according to a union recruitment circular. If UK union membership as a proportion of the working population is not to dwindle to US levels, unions such as the NCU must expand out of their shrinking, union-friendly heartlands and seek members in smaller companies in communications and services. Mr Alan Harley, NCU national organiser, has reported that the 150,000-strong union is on the way to surpassing its modest target of recruiting 1,000 members outside BT and the Post Office by the end of 1992. The NCU has recruited 350 members in Mercury, the main BT competitor, after visiting only 10 out of the 70 main sites, but the three-year aim of recruiting up to half Mercury's 7,000 eligible staff may be over-optimistic.</p>

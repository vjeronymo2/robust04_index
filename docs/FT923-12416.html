			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Private View: The message from the mountain top THE ABBOT of Xuanzhong monastery on the sacred mountain of Wutaishan has an alert, ageless face and bright eyes. He sat in a Birmingham hotel room, chatting affably, while the rain poured down on the frantic shoppers outside. To describe the abbot as detached would be misleading. It is as if everything around him but the humans was invisible. Liao Man inhabits another planet. He has lived 62 of his 70 years as a Buddhist monk on a barren mountain in northern China, playing 2,000-year-old music in a 2,000-year-old monastery. Until last week, save for a short visit to Hong Kong in 1989, he had never been out of China. What goes on in the head of a man who has been whisked by the Time Machine from antiquity, half across the globe, into the modern world? How had his travels impressed him? 'Hong Kong is good,' replied Liao. 'It's like England. It doesn't have a big, big wind. At Wutaishan it is really, really windy and everywhere is very dusty, inside and outside the temple, everywhere.' Are you surprised by what you see here, I asked. Or are you too old to be surprised by anything? 'People are very kind, very nice. I told my monks I think this country is a good place.' I leaned forward, waiting for some shaft of spiritual insight into our corrupt Western ways. He continued: 'Here you really don't have any dust. The air is very clear, everything is very clear, very nice.' Had you heard about the West before you came? 'We don't go out so we never hear anything.' Do you know about Christianity? 'I know about it. We have a Christian church in China.' What else do you know about the West? 'Normally we don't know much. We don't care too much what happens.' I motioned to the street outside and asked if he could imagine living in Birmingham. He agreed that the city was busy, but observed that it was far less crowded than Taiyuan, the capital of Shanxi province. 'I think my life on Wutai mountain is very good also,' he added politely. What about the things in the shops, the things to buy, the entertainment? Would you like to live like this? The abbot was not to be tempted into moral denunciation. 'Mostly I feel that here the air is really clear. As for other things, I don't feel anything.' You have no other impression of the place? 'No, I just feel that the air and ground everywhere is so clean.' Perhaps Liao Man was just being strenuously diplomatic. Yet even in China, where a foreigner's unsolicited criticism is doubly unwelcome, ordinary people will beg you to say truthfully what you think of their country. Or perhaps he was under orders. Early in our meeting a gentleman whom I took to be the Communist Party minder came in and offered to sit with us. When I declined his offer he muttered something about there being no restrictions, provided we didn't 'go over the religious limit' and left. Or perhaps material things really mean nothing to him. (One of his colleagues, however, did express an interest in the net curtains on his bedroom window.) Liao has come to England with eight other musician monks to demonstrate some of the world's oldest music (they perform today, Monday and Thursday at London's South Bank.) The music, like Buddhism itself, percolated from India before the first century (the Xuanzhong monastery was founded in AD 68), flowered during the Tang dynasty and greatly influenced native court and village composers. Liao entered holy orders as a child of eight and began memorising the ancient scores and playing the instruments as a teenager. He learned the guangzi (a deep-throated double-reed pipe) and the sheng (mouth organ). 'But now my teeth are not strong enough to hold the reeds.' He smiled and showed a set of even, white teeth. 'Now I play percussion instead.' I asked if there were any young monks to continue the tradition. 'There are no young people'. He laughed ruefully. 'They don't like playing it.' Why not? 'Because it's too difficult for them. You have to read this notation and it takes a really long time to learn by heart the big thick music books.' Does that mean that eventually the music will die out? 'Very few people are becoming monks. The times are changing; around the five or six counties where we live, when we die it won't survive.' Although the older Chinese peasants still practice their religion, the Communist authorities have made intermittent attempts to stamp it out as a reactionary superstition. Buddhism is today tolerated once more, but as a cultural antique, a tourist attraction. The number of temples and monasteries on Wutaishan has dwindled from over 300 in its heyday to under 50; but the state is paying for lavish restoration and subsidises the monks in their role as guardians. Liao Man's monastery is down to ten old monks, aged 70 to 90, and two novices, pupils of his brother Chong, a bent and hollow-eyed 73-year-old who also plays in the band and who sat silently listening to our conversation. In the summer the monastery has the help of a dozen Buddhist nuns. Life on Wutaishan, one of four sacred mountains, is not quite as sheltered as one might imagine. Apart from contact with the stream of summer tourists, Chinese and foreign, the monks have their own television set. Liao said he watches drama serials and the broadcasts of Peking opera. He admitted that he had tried watching British television in his hotel room, but added: 'I don't like watching television here because when they speak I can't understand.' Apart from being a centre of Chinese Buddhism, Wutaishan was a focal point of the Japanese invasion in the 1930s. Liao said they occupied the mountain but did not destroy anything 'because they were Buddhists themselves.' In the early days of the Communist revolution the monks were allowed to continue practising their faith, though much of their land was taken from them. The worst years for the monks came in the mid-1960s when Mao launched his purge, the Cultural Revolution. 'It was a disaster,' Liao said. Most of the younger monks fled the monasteries and returned to their villages; he and his older brethren stayed. The Red Guards, youthful zealots from the cities charged with tearing down the old to make way for the new, toppled the Buddhas from their pedestals. 'They were young,' said Liao. 'They didn't understand anything. But they didn't bully us. Very few people were bad and destroyed things. They didn't really damage the temples too much because Wutaishan for a long time had been left unrepaired. It was really broken down. Now they (the authorities) repair it very beautifully.' I asked what religious controls were left. 'There is no control. You can have your religion and can believe it as long as you don't disturb other people's work and stay in your own temple and do your own things.' Have you heard Western music? 'I don't like it. I have heard both big orchestra music and popular music, but I don't like it. I can't take it.' Why not? 'In my soul I don't like it. It's very noisy, it's not in my thought. Whereas the music we do is ours. We even made our own instruments.' Do you enjoy performing in public, or does it make you shy? 'I don't mind. I can play wherever people want me to play. In my mind I am still playing in my temple.' Are the others nervous? 'They are not nervous either, because we all learned this music when we were very, very young. So we know it very well.' Doesn't it sound primitive to you? 'I think no other Chinese music can be better than our Buddhist music. It's very beautiful, very gentle, very quiet. If it's noisy it's when the percussion instruments play too much. Or maybe we are used to it.' What do you think about as you play? 'When I play I feel as if I am still in Wutaishan,' he said. I think he never left.</p>

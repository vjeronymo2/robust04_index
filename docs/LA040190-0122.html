			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EASING OF RENT LAW PROPOSED;  </P> <P> SANTA MONICA: A RENTERS' RIGHTS GROUP WILL DISCUSS ENDORSING RENT INCREASES FOR  UNITS VOLUNTARILY VACATED AS WELL AS FOR EXISTING TENANTS.  </P> <P> Santa Monicans for Renters' Rights, the tenants group that gained control of  the city by getting a tough rent-control ordinance approved in 1979, is now  scrambling to relax the law to stop a growing number of evictions -- and to  save its political future.  </P> <P> SMRR members will meet today at 2 p.m. at the Retail Clerk's Hall to decide on  a series of proposals that would allow some rent increases for existing tenants  and even larger increases on units voluntarily vacated.  </P> <P> "This may be the most important SMRR meeting in 10 years," said Paul  Rosenstein, a SMRR steering committee member. "We are proposing some dramatic  and very substantial changes in rent control."  </P> <P> Brad Jones, co-chairman of SMRR, and Rosenstein said in an interview last week  that the proposals are designed to discourage landlords from using the 1986  state Ellis Act, which allows landlords to legally evict tenants and get out of  the rental housing business.  </P> <P> Owners of more than 1,000 units in Santa Monica have notified the Rent Control  Board that they intend to evict tenants and go out of business since the law  was enacted. Landlords have argued that rent control is so restrictive that  their properties are more valuable vacant than with an apartment building.  </P> <P> Landlords said they believe public sentiment has swung against SMRR because of  the massive evictions, and predict that the November municipal election, when  three of the seven City Council seats and four of the five rent board seats  will be up for election, will validate their position. SMRR members occupy the  majority on both boards.  </P> <P> Carl Lambert, an attorney and landlord, said the only way to stop the evictions  under the Ellis Act is by implementing vacancy decontrol, which would allow  rents to increase to market levels whenever a unit is voluntarily vacated. An  initiative petition is being prepared by a group of landlords and some tenants,  according to Lambert, that would allow a form of vacancy decontrol.  </P> <P> Although SMRR leaders insist they still oppose vacancy decontrol, one of their  proposals calls for allowing landlords to raise rents a certain percentage or  dollar amount -- not yet determined -- whenever a unit is voluntarily vacated.  </P> <P> Rosenstein, who said the proposals were developed after discussions with  landlords, tenants and housing specialists, said the proposals are not a change  in the group's basic objective of providing affordable housing but an attempt  to deal with the current housing crisis in a realistic manner.  </P> <P> "Rent control has achieved its major goals in the 1980s, and now changes are  needed to meet the challenges of the 1990s," he said. "We have to do something  dramatic because there is no hope for relief in Sacramento."  </P> <P> Other proposed changes would allow landlords to recoup from existing tenants  the cost of increased city fees and assessments, and reduce the paper work  needed to pass on the costs for capital improvements such as a new roof.  </P> <P> The other changes proposed by the group's housing committee would seek to  establish a fund to subsidize housing for low-income tenants, require a minimum  level of maintenance from landlords, create anti-harassment measures to protect  tenants and set up a mediation process to resolve tenant-landlord disputes.  </P> <P> The committee is also recommending that SMRR reverse its position opposing the  rent board's Incentive Housing Program and encourage participation for at least  a year.  </P> <P> The program, which was adopted on a 3-2 vote in October, allows landlords to  raise rents by as much as $900 on some units if an equal number of units are  set aside with rents as low as $274 for very-low-income persons.  </P> <P> Both SMRR and Action, a local landlords group, denounced the program for giving  the other side too much.  </P> <P> But rent board Chairwoman Susan Packer Davis said in interview that it is SMRR  -- in a desperate effort to save its political future -- that is now giving  landlords too much.  </P> <P> "With our program we may give up something, but a least we get something back,"  Davis said. "With their proposals we get nothing back. In fact, people who are  in apartments now are going to have to pay more rent."  </P> <P> Davis said SMRR's proposal to reverse its position on the program is "almost  laughable."  </P> <P> "They trashed us all summer because they said it was vacancy decontrol," she  said. "Now they are the ones offering vacancy decontrol. I find it almost  laughable. But I am very saddened by it. You have a few people who have their  own political futures in mind offering proposals that will gut rent control  completely."  </P> <P> Jones denies that the group's motives are political.  </P> <P> "We've lost elections before," he said. "Our first and foremost concern is to  prevent the human tragedy that is taking place" with the growing number of  evictions.  </P> <P> Apartment owner Lambert, however, is just pleased that SMRR is finally looking  to provide some financial relief for landlords.  </P> <P> "I am in support of several of the things they are proposing," he said. "They  are saying that vacancy decontrol in some form is OK. This is what we have been  telling them for 11 years.  </P> <P> "What is driving (SMRR) to the negotiation table is the realization that  restrictive rent control has created the Ellis crisis and they better do  something to keep the landlords in business. Tenants and landlords are now on  the same side."  </P> <P> </P> <P> BACKGROUND: The tenants' group, Santa Monicans for Renters' Rights, was  instrumental in getting a tough rent-control ordinance approved in Santa Monica  in 1979. In 1986, the state Legislature passed the Ellis Act, which allows  landlords to legally evict tenants and get out of the rental housing business.  Since the law was enacted, owners of more than 1,000 units in the city have  notified the Rent Control Board that they intend to evict tenants and go out of  business. SMRR is studying proposals to relax the law to stop a growing number  of evictions.  </P></p>

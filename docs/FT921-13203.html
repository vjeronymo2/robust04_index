			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Government Bonds: Overnight gains in foreign markets lift Treasuries GAINS in foreign markets overnight and sporadic short-covering helped to lift US bond prices across the board in light trading yesterday. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  15/32 at 105 1/32 , yielding 7.563 per cent. The two-year note was also firmer, up  5/32 at 100 5/32 , yielding 4.913 per cent. Despite the short-covering, which was said to have been concentrated among Japanese players, the market lacked a firm direction. The strength of prices at the intermediate and long end of the market was primarily a correction from last week, when selling of longer-dated maturities was heavy amid deflated hopes of further interest rate cuts. The biggest gains were seen in the 10-year maturities. The thinness of the market exaggerated the impact of the buying, and the absence of retail demand suggested that underlying sentiment had not shifted significantly. LONG-dated UK government bond prices dropped on funding worries and shortening trades yesterday. Activity in the gilt market picked up after the Bank of England announced details of its forthcoming auction yesterday afternoon. The Bank said it would auction Pounds 1.8bn of the 9 3/4 per cent gilt due 2002 on January 29, bringing the total size of the issue up to Pounds 4.8bn. After the announcement, traders reported some shortening trades into the 10-year sector. The auction issue will be partly-paid, with 25 per cent payable on tender, 40 per cent on February 24, and the rest on March 26. The 9 3/4 per cent gilt due 2002, which will become the new 10-year benchmark stock, was widely tipped as the auction issue. The 10-year gilt is expected to appeal to international investors, traders said. However, the market fell on concern about further funding requirements in the 1991-1992 tax year. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew is forecasting a further Pounds 2bn in gilt issuance in the 1991-92 tax year on top of the Pounds 1.8bn auction. In the futures market, the Liffe gilt contract opened at 97.30 and fell to 97.09 by late afternoon on average volumes. The 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 fell from 116 3/32 to 115 19/32 while the 9 3/4 per cent gilt due 2002 fell from 102 7/32 to 101 31/32 . Sterling strength helped to limit the fall among short-dated stocks. SHORT and medium-dated Japanese government bonds ended stronger yesterday on hopes that the Bank of Japan would lower interest rates in order to support the Tokyo stock market. The benchmark No 129 bond reached a two-year high when the yield fell to 5.26 per cent in Tokyo trading. The yield on the No 129 opened at 5.295 per cent in Tokyo and moved to 5.26 per cent before closing at 5.28 per cent. The yen strengthened against the dollar from Y123.85 to Y122.95, attracting buying interest in the bond market, although traders reported some profit-taking later on. Traders attributed the dollar's weakening to rumours of central bank intervention. Both the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan intervened on Friday to strengthen the yen. THE European government bond markets rallied yesterday helped by strong demand for short-dated securities from Far Eastern, US and European buyers. Traders reported particularly strong demand from central banks for short-dated Dutch and German government paper, which resulted in a flattening of the respective yield curves. In the Netherlands, investors poured Fl 7bn into the two new Dutch state tap issues, bringing total sales of the 10-year and 15-year issues to Fl 8.8bn so far this week. The financing agency boosted the selling prices on the 8.25 per cent tap bonds due 2002 and 2007 in stages during the day following unexpectedly high demand for the issues. Traders said investors were attracted by the spreads of about 50 basis points over the 10-year German government bonds. In Germany, the Liffe bund futures contract opened at 88.46 and climbed to a high of 88.69 before slipping to 88.61 by late afternoon. Despite worries about the current wage negotiations, investors are expecting the Bundesbank to come under considerable pressure to lower German interest rates at the Group of Seven meeting this weekend. Elsewhere in Europe, Spanish government bond prices picked up on hopes that the strength of the peseta might prompt a cut in Spanish interest rates. The Italian bond market, which opened the day on a strong note, closed higher on the day, helped by gains in the other European markets. The key March 2001 BTP ended at 101.22, compared with 100.93/94 the previous day. In the futures market, the Liffe contract closed about 20 basis points higher at 98.71. Yesterday's L8,500bn repo tender, at which the average rate fell to 11.74 per cent, pushed short-term interbank rates down, boosting sentiment in the market. See Lex</p>

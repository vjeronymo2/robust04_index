			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Polish tariffs biased to the EC, says US POLAND and other eastern European countries seeking European Community membership are erecting trade barriers to non-EC goods, according to US government and industry officials. US computer makers and government officials are accusing the EC of encouraging the erection of trade barriers in eastern Europe to benefit their own industries at the expense of US and other competitors. 'What has occurred in Poland, and appears likely to happen in Czechoslovakia and Hungary as well, is that at the EC's urging, Poland has adopted measures that create a major tariff wall clearly designed to block out US and other non-EC goods in favour of EC products,' says the Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers Association. Poland eliminated or reduced import tariffs on EC goods in March under the interim trade provisions of its association agreement with the EC. In August, Poland imposed import tariffs averaging 20 per cent on a range of products that previously were duty-free, including computers, telecommunications equipment, pharmaceuticals, farm products and chemicals. A senior US trade official criticised the EC for what is seen in the US as its failure to uphold a 'gentleman's agreement' that neither side would seek to benefit from the effort to aid the emerging east European democracies through trade. The issue threatens to become another in the lengthening queue of trade disputes between the US and EC. The US is insisting that Poland lower its tariffs before it renegotiates the terms of its membership of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). The US may deny Polish products duty-free treatment under the Generalised System of Preferences for developing countries unless the issue is settled. 'Over half their trade comes in (to the US) duty-free,' the trade official said. 'We have been doing a major review to eliminate the barriers to Polish trade. But its hard to defend this when our exporters are facing huge differentials, and the Poles are refusing to talk to us about it.' EC officials said any increases in central European countries' tariffs were unrelated to their recent free trade agreements with Brussels, but were part of their general move to a free market and to greater use of tariffs to regulate their trade. The Brussels officials said the EC's free trade accords with Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary were compatible with Gatt, and if the US wanted lower tariffs in these countries, it, too, should negotiate a free trade arrangement with them.</p>

			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: WH Smith strong With the executive changes at WH Smith largely discounted prior to yesterday's agm, the probability of a share restructuring became the main focus of investor interest. The high-voting 'B' shares immediately jumped to a hefty premium, with analysts reporting guarded comments from Smith directors to the effect that the dual structure will probably be reformed once the 'B' shares regain a healthy premium to the 'A' stock. The 'B's have five times the voting rights of the 'A's, with both prices generally reflecting this gap. However, the board hints over the 'B's sent the tightly traded category - which has large tranches held by directors and family - sharply forward, closing 6 ahead at 98p. The 'A's added 9 at 479p. Stores specialists said the retirement of Sir Simon Hornby and the top-level reshuffle that will follow is unlikely to have any effect on the Smith management style.</p>

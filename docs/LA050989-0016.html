			<p><P> May 9, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: DUN &amp; BRADSTREET SHAKES UP UNIT  </P> <P> Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp., under attack from customer lawsuits and negative  publicity surrounding its credit services sales practices, Monday announced a  shake-up that will replace the president of the credit services unit.  </P> <P> John P. Kunz, president of Dun &amp; Bradstreet Credit Services, has been  reassigned to a staff position within the company, effective May 15.  </P> <P> Kunz heads a department that is facing several lawsuits by customers who  claimed to have been misled into over-purchasing the company's credit data.  </P> <P> In the shake-up, the company said it formed Dun &amp; Bradstreet Business  Credit Services, a new organizational entity within the Business Information  Group that will combine five operating units.  </P> <P> Dun &amp; Bradstreet would not comment on whether Kunz's reassignment was  related to the lawsuits.  </P> <P> But with a dominant position in the credit services business, Dun &amp;  Bradstreet's moves were seen as a way of assuring that the growing controversy  would not lead to a loss of its leading market share.  </P> <P> Analysts have said that a festering controversy might allow smaller competitors  such as TRW Inc. the chance to cut into Dun &amp; Bradstreet's towering 60%  market share.  </P> <P> The new entity will include Dun &amp; Bradstreet Credit Services, D&amp;B  Receivable Management Services, American Credit Indemnity, D&amp;B Information  Resources and D&amp;B Information Systems.  </P> <P> Jack Murray will become president of the newly formed entity. The company said  Murray will continue as president-Americas, Business Information Group and  senior vice president-customer information needs for Dun &amp; Bradstreet.  </P> <P> Kunz will become a member of the policy staff of the Business Information Group  and will assist James E. Rutter, executive vice president, in directing the  company's worldwide marketing strategy.  </P></p>

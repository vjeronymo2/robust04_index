			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Franco-German pledge helps ease tensions Germany and France yesterday promised tight co-ordination of their successive European Union presidencies over the next year, at a summit replete with gestures of friendship that appeared to clear the air of recent tensions. For the first time since 1944, German soldiers will march down the Champs Elysees on July 14 as a result of President Francois Mitterrand's announcement yesterday that he was inviting the multinational Eurocorps to take part in France's Bastille Day military parade. Inevitably absent from next week's D-Day commemoration in Normandy, Chancellor Helmut Kohl yesterday expressed his 'warm' welcome for this 'very generous' gesture, and is expected to attend the July 14 parade, along with leaders of Belgium, Luxembourg and Spain which also contribute to the Eurocorps. Mr Kohl for his part presented the French president with one of 28 valuable paintings taken at the end of the war to Germany, which is now returning them. Mr Mitterrand said he hoped the next year, in which Germany which will take the chair of the EU Council of Ministers on July 1 and then hand it on January 1 next year to France, would give the impression of 'a continuous, if not a common, Franco-German presidency'. Its main themes are expected to be fostering more jobs at home and more stability to the east. France now seems satisfied that Germany will not try to rush east European countries into an unadapted Union, in the way that earlier this spring Paris criticised Bonn for ramming through entry by Nordic countries and Austria. Mr Kohl endorsed Mr Mitterrand's call for the EU to reinforce its institutions as it took in new members, and the German leader rejected any attempt to turn the Union into 'just a big free trade zone, as once proposed by one of our number', a reference to Lady Thatcher, the former UK premier. Germany and France will place 'development of the (Union's) common foreign and security policy. . . . at the centre of their co-operation' in running their presidencies, according to a communique yesterday. A key part of this common policy will be closer security links with east European countries, and partnership with Russia. Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, confirmed that France was no longer blocking a new EU accord with Russia, because Paris had now received assurances of adequate safeguards against Russian enriched uranium flooding the EU market. By redoubling their gestures of reconciliation, and by keeping all advisers out of most of their private talks, President Mitterrand and Chancellor Kohl gave the impression of wanting to make the most of one of their last official meetings; the former is not up for re-election next year, and the latter's re-election in October is by no means sure. But some of the unusual privacy was also to discuss the succession to Mr Jacques Delors as European Commisison president. Quizzed about their choice, the French president would only say that 'I think we (France and Germany) will be in agreement to support the same person after we have consulted our 10 partners'. However, officials say privately their leaders prefer Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister.</p>

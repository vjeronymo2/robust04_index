			<p><P> March 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST : LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P>  EX-RESTAURATEUR HELD ON THEFT CHARGES  </P> <P> A former Torrance restaurateur who prosecutors say used bogus checks to steal  almost $250,000 before fleeing to Australia seven years ago was ordered held  without bail Thursday.  </P> <P> Federal Magistrate George King agreed with the prosecutor who said that James  McGrail, 52, who was extradited to the United States last week, is "a severe  risk for flight."  </P> <P> McGrail, who owned the now-defunct Bounty Restaurant, is charged with two  counts of transporting forged checks and three counts of bank larceny.  Officials said the former Palos Verdes resident altered a $125 insurance draft  issued to pay for his son's medical bills so that it read $125,000 and  deposited the check in the Torrance branch of Security Pacific Bank, along with  a stolen check for $172,879 from a bank in Essex, England.  </P> <P> McGrail has pleaded not guilty. His lawyer, Alan Launspach, argued that McGrail  should have been granted bail because he had the opportunity to flee while free  on bond in Australia -- where he fought extradition for three months -- but did  not.  </P></p>

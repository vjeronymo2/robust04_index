			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Allied-Lyons disposes of coffee activities to concentrate on tea Allied-Lyons is breaking with its past through the sale of its coffee operations, thought to be worth about Pounds 30m. The Lyons coffee brand was established 90 years ago and coffee drinking has been growing relative to tea drinking. However, Allied-Lyons has decided to concentrate its 'hot beverages' activities on its Tetley tea business. The group, which includes wines and spirits, brewing and retailing as well as food manufacturing, said that Tetley had a better international spread and was the predominant part of its hot beverages oper-ation. It has 26.3 per cent of the UK tea market by value. The coffee activities are being divided into two, instant and real. At present the two are located on the same site at Greenford, Middlesex, but are in separate factories. The instant coffee business, employing about 400 people, is being sold to Kraft Jacobs Suchard, part of Philip Morris, the US food group, which already owns the Kenco and Maxwell House brands. KJS has 24 per cent of the UK instant coffee market and the acquisition of the Lyons business, which largely makes for own-label customers, will give it a further 11 per cent. While KJS said the deal was subject to the approval of the Office of Fair Trading, it took comfort from a 1991 Monopolies and Mergers Commission report which cleared Nestle, which has 55 per cent of the instant coffee market, from acting against the public interest. KJS said the deal would make it a more effective competitor to Nestle. It would still have the Lyons name for instant coffee. The real coffee side is being bought by Paulig UK, part of the large Finnish food group, which already owns the Melitta coffee brand in the UK. Paulig UK also announced the appointment of Mr Richard Hancock as managing director. He said the deal would give Paulig UK more than 20 per cent of the real coffee market in the UK making it the market leader. Paulig is looking at moving production from Greenford, where 100 people are employed on the real coffee side, to its own plant in Wimbledon, south-west London. Some jobs could move with the work. Allied-Lyons merged its UK and international hot beverages activities last year, and the business has since undergone a thorough review which resulted in the decision to sell the coffee side.</p>

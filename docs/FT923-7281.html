			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Second stage of Ankara gas deal goes to Turkish group ATILLA Dogan, a privately owned Turkish construction group, has signed a letter of intent to build the second stage of the Ankara natural gas distribution network, beating competition from British Gas and SAE of France. Atilla Dogan, in partnership with SII of Italy, expects to sign a contract with Ankara Municipality within 30 days, and to complete the construction within four years. The project is to connect gas lines to 150,000 city homes, constructing 20-30 gas regulating stations using natural gas supplied under a 20-year contract from Russia. Istanbul and Bursa are installing similar systems. The decision to offer the project to Atilla Dogan is a blow to British Gas which won the first-stage gas network and was closely involved in designing the system. British Gas was unable to match Atilla Dogan, who came in at around Dollars 80m compared with the UK bid of Dollars 122m. Atilla Dogan was yesterday in final negotiation with EGO, the Turkish state gas company. The company confirmed it was seeking finance from Sace, the Italian export credit agency. The company has also been asked to secure a bridging loan from local sources in US dollars to enable construction to start.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, April 17 (Andrey Sharkov of BTA) -- The  lifting of sanctions on Yugoslavia would lead to a peaceful  settlement of the Yugoconflict, visiting Yugoslav Foreign  Minister Vladislav Jovanovic told journalists here today.  Jovanovic arrived on a brief informal visit to Sofia from  Athens yesterday. A Yugoslav foreign minister was last in Sofia  in 1993.    Jovanovic and his Bulgarian counterpart Stanislav Daskalov  today discussed some alarming aspects of the situation in the  Balkans. Peace was very close several times last and this year  but was sabotaged by Muslims (in Bosnia) and their foreign  patrons, Jovanovic said after the meeting. Bulgaria and  Yugoslavia are equally interested in a peaceful, fair settlement  of the conflict. I believe bilateral relations will go ahead at  full speed after lifting the sanctions; it would be in the  interest of the two countries and of peace and security in the  region, Jovanovic also told the press.    No one ever proved Yugoslavia is to blame for the war in  Bosnia- Herzegovina, said the Yugoslav foreign minister. The  sanctions create a favourable climate for the emergence of  extremist ideologies not only in the Balkans, according to  Jovanovic. Meeting with Daskalov, he emphasized the importance  of joint action in support of lifting the sanctions. Bulgaria  so far has not committed itself to participation in such action  but the sanctions have inflicted heavy losses on it and it is  interested in their ending, said the Yugoslav guest. The two  ministers discussed a proposal by Greek Foreign Minister Karolos  Papoulias for three Balkan states, including Bulgaria, to urge  the UN to lift the sanctions. Expressing the Bulgarian stand,  Daskalov said that Bulgaria will abide by the UN Secuirty  Council resolutions despite damage to its economy.    During their informal talks, that lasted for nearly three  hours, Daskalov and Jovanovic discussed the issue of Macedonia  [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] and stands  of its neighbours. The Bulgarian proposal for Macedonia's  neighbours to issue a joint declaration recognizing that  republic's borders and announcing the lack of any territorial  claims, cannot be carried out at this stage, said Daskalov after  the meeting. The Yugoslav foreign minister said Macedonia faced  no threat from its neighbour to the north (Yugoslavia) but quite  a few things needed yet to be done to establish goodneighbourly  bilateral relations.    The two foreign ministers differed on the issue of the  Bulgarian minority in the Western Outlands (in Yugoslavia,  former Bulgarian territories taken away under the 1919 Treaty of  Neuilly). According to Daskalov, the rights of this minority  are not strictly observed whereas Jovanovic said no rights  violations have been recorded. The hardships ensuing from the  sanctions, however, are forcing the Yugoslav authorities to  curtail the rights not only of minorities but of all the people,  the Yugoslav foreign minister told the press. In such cases,  efforts are being made to compensate the minorities with  exraordinary measures, he said.    The autonomous region of Kosovo is not a party to the  Yugoconflict, the Yugoslav guest told the press conference.  Separatism, fueled by Albania, was kindled there long before the  Bosnian conflict, he said. According to the Yugoslav minister,  a spillover of the war into Kosovo should not be feared.    The Yugoslav foreign minister assessed the Bulgarian policy  on the Yugoconflict as objective. According to him, Bulgaria  placed the three warring parties in Bosnia-Herzegovina on an  equal footing. The transit of equipment for UN peacekeepers in  Macedonia via Bulgaria is consistent with Bulgaria's stand of  non-intervention in the Yugowar, as there is no war in  Macedonia, said Jovanovic. (The Bulgarian Parliament appproved  such a transit on April 15). Yugoslavia, however, takes a  negative view of the military presence in Macedonia because of  Skopje's unsupported claims of "a danger from the north," he  said. No conflict exists between Macedonia and Yugoslavia;  Macedonia is not facing any danger from the north and never has,  the Yugoslav diplomat emphasized.</p>

			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / London admits errors in secret documents on IRA contacts The British government's credibility on Northern Ireland was severely tarnished last night when it admitted that mistakes were contained in secret documents released on Monday detailing exchanges with Provisional leaders. The admission followed confirmation that Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds will tomorrow make a concerted attempt to bridge differences between London and Dublin over a constitutional settlement for the province. The meeting will come amid signs of mounting strain in their relations. The Northern Ireland Office was last night at pains to emphasise that mistakes in the documents were accidental and the result of transcriptional typing. The admission, which is expected to be pounced on by Unionist MPs in the Commons today, followed threats by Sinn Fein to 'set the record straight' amid claims that some of the British documents were bogus. Separately, the IRA last night made the sensational claim, strongly denied by Downing Street, that the government had proposed holding secret talks with it in March in Scotland or Scandinavia. It said: 'We wish to confirm that . . . the British Government made a definitive proposal for full-blown delegate meetings between their representatives and Sinn Fein.' It claimed the government asked for an unannounced suspension of activity to help accommodate the meetings. Both London and Dublin were last night playing down expectations of what the 'working' summit between the two prime ministers was likely to achieve, billing it as the first of two or three important sessions that could take place before Christmas. At least one additional meeting between the two leaders - at next week's European Council in Brussels - might well be needed before a joint communique could be agreed. The two prime ministers would be accompanied tomorrow by other senior ministers. The main sticking point is understood to concern Dublin's insistence on including acceptance of the principle of self-determination for the people of all of Ireland in any joint communique. According to officials in Dublin this would imply an all-Ireland referendum on any changes to Northern Ireland's constitutional status, although these would also need the consent of the majority in the province. London is understood to be worried that a formulation involving an all-Ireland referendum would be unacceptable to Unionists. Downing Street hinted last night that it regarded Ulster Unionist acceptance of the content of any joint communique as crucial, saying: 'It is getting words that can command support throughout Northern Ireland - that's a key factor.'

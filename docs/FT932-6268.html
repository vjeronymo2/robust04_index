			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Germany's plan on deportation runs into snag GERMANY'S plan to deport asylum-seekers to neighbouring countries, approved in parliament on Wednesday, could be held up by Czech officials unwilling to take them back. Mr Josef Zileniec, the Czech foreign affairs minister said yesterday Germany should understand it could not solve its domestic security issues at the cost of the Czech republic. Czech officials have indicated they will only agree to take back asylum-seekers from Germany once proper border controls are set up with Slovakia. The bulk of asylum-seekers coming from the former Yugoslavia, Romania and Bulgaria cross the former Czechoslovak territory. 'We first need assurances that countries such as Romania and Bulgaria will take them back,' an official at the Czech foreign affairs ministry said. 'We also need a proper border with Slovakia. This could take two years to be set up,' he added. German conservative MPs on Wednesday hailed a deportation agreement signed three weeks ago with Poland. Under the agreement, Poland will take back 10,000 asylum-seekers this year and an unlimited amount thereafter. Germany is offering DM120m (Pounds 47.8m) to build the infrastructure to host the asylum-seekers. The agreement with Poland was a crucial weapon in winning over the opposition Social Democrats who opposed for a long time the constitutional change. The new law dilutes the automatic right of a person to seek asylum upon entering Germany. Instead, guards will be able to turn back at the border asylum-seekers 'with manifestedly unfounded' claims to 'safe' countries. Officials at the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Bonn have warned that the German constitutional change will only partly curb the influx of foreigners into Germany. A high number are expected to enter the country illegally, now that filing an asylum demand no longer ensures they can legally stay in the country for a period of time. Plans to reinforce surveillance on Germany's eastern borders are under way, with an additional 1,700 police men due to take up duty later this summer. The interior ministry is also testing infra-red equipment which will allow border trespassers to be seen at night. According to the interior ministry, tougher security measures are also planned for Frankfurt airport, where border guards will be able to send back asylum-seekers coming from countries where no violations of human rights have been reported.</p>

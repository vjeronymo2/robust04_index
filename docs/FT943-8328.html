			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / UK, France in fish accord Britain and France have reached an agreement over the disputed fisheries around Guernsey, the foreign office said yesterday. Waters around the Channel Island were the scene earlier this year of clashes involving French and Guernsey fishing boats and Royal Navy vessels. Under terms of the agreement, which will run initially for a year, fishermen of both sides will be allowed to resume fishing in the disputed areas and confiscated lobster pots will be returned while negotiations on a long-term settlement continue.</p>

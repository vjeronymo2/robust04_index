			<p><P> February 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN BAPTISTS PLANNING DOOR-TO-DOOR DRIVE IN VEGAS  </P> <P> Southern Baptists plan a door-to-door evangelism campaign this summer when they  hold their convention in Las Vegas -- the city of slot machines and legalized  gambling.  </P> <P> More than 1,160 lay people and pastors from several states already have signed  up to knock on doors before the denomination's annual meeting in the Nevada  city June 13-15.  </P> <P> "This is an organized witnessing effort to share Christ with every home in the  city," said Larry J. Lewis, president of the Southern Baptist Convention Home  Mission Board.  </P> <P> The Home Mission Board also has distributed pages of the Las Vegas telephone  directory to more than 6,000 "prayer volunteers," who have pledged to pray for  residents of the city.  </P> <P> The volunteers will get pep talks from television minister Jerry Falwell and  Los Angeles Baptist Pastor E.V. Hill -- neither of whom are Southern Baptists  -- and Arthur Blessitt, a Hollywood evangelist who has dragged a cross through  much of the world, and Florida evangelist Rick Stanley, stepbrother of the late  Elvis Presley.  </P> <P> They will distribute about 10,000 New Testaments and 10,000 gospel tracts in  the city.  </P> <P> Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce President Mark Smith, a 30-year resident of the  gambling capital, said he has "never heard of anything like this happening in  Las Vegas before. But it may be better received than a lot of people might  think."  </P> <P> Simultaneous revivals are set for eight Las Vegas area churches during the week  before the annual meeting, which is expected to attract about 20,000 Southern  Baptists.  </P></p>

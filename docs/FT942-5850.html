			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / International Company News: Endesa price fall clouds future offerings The issue price for the partial privatisation of Endesa, the state electricity utility, has fallen below expectations, raising doubts about future public equity offerings. The offering in Endesa, which reduced the state holding by 9 per cent to 65 per cent, realised only Pta144bn (Dollars 1.06bn). This compared with Pta200bn that had been anticipated when the disposal was planned in February. 'We've had really bad luck with the markets over the past three months and our subscription closed on a particularly criminal day for equities,' said Endesa. The offer was priced at Pta6.450 per share, a price that was set by Endesa's closing price in New York on Tuesday and which was down on its earlier Tuesday Madrid close of Pta6,550. Yesterday, as the Spanish stock exchange continued to fall, the utility's share price dropped further to Pta6,400 in Madrid as a heavy volume of about 2m Endesa shares were traded. The price falls came as a shock. In the past, equity offerings by Spanish public companies - including Endesa, which first tapped the international markets in 1989 - had been unqualified successes. The only comfort for Endesa was that the offering, which was co-ordinated by Goldman Sachs, had performed somewhat better in its domestic retail tranche, where the offer was 3.25 times subscribed with 200,000 applications for an average of 100 shares each. The utility had purposely weighted the offering towards Spanish investors, and the demand from domestic retailers meant that it was able to exercise its clawback option and reduce shares offered to institutions by 16 per cent. Analysts in Madrid said yesterday that the ill-fortune surrounding Endesa's equity offer was bound to influence other public disposals that are in the pipeline. These include an equity offering by Repsol, the oil, gas and chemicals group, which is tentatively planned for the end of the year, and possibly one by Argentaria, the state banking corporation. 'It's quite clear that partial privatisations are no longer a well spring on which the government can rely,' said Mr Juan Bastos, chief executive of brokers Ibersercurities.</p>

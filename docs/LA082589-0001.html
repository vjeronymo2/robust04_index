			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. / PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> The Machine of the Moment has transmitted everything from press releases to  take-out restaurant orders. And now, a new use. . . .  </P> <P> West Hollywood business executive Anita Gittelson showed up for work and found  that an assistant had tendered her resignation via a fax machine.  </P> <P> "It was a bit strange," Gittelson said. "She was in Syracuse, N.Y., when she  sent it. In fact, it's strange that she was even in Syracuse."  </P> <P> Sure, Los Angeles City Council positions aren't the most high profile jobs, but  you'd think that voters would be able to remember which members are alive.  </P> <P> Six constituents of Councilman Joel Wachs phoned his office in a panic Thursday  after an item about a Chatsworth newsletter was reported here. The newsletter,  for some reason, said that a building's plaque "was to be personally presented  by an old friend, Mr. Joel Wachs, Councilman, (but) Mr. Wachs passed away just  prior to its unveiling."  </P> <P> Wachs spokesman Greg Nelson said of the mourners: "At least someone could have  sent flowers."  </P> <P> Or faxed a card.  </P> <P> Now Money magazine says that Los Angeles is the 13th most liveable area in the  nation, ranking ahead of Orange County (No. 23), by the way.  </P> <P> This follows assorted studies concluding that, compared to other regions in the  United States, the Freeway City is:  </P> <P>  -- The 9th most stressful.  </P> <P>  -- The 2nd most romantic.  </P> <P>  -- The 10th most stressful.  </P> <P>  -- The 2nd most health-conscious.  </P> <P>  -- The 11th dirtiest and least safe in which to raise a family.  </P> <P> Sounds like the typical Angeleno is a hard-driving businessman who flirts on  the jogging track and doesn't shower afterward.  </P> <P> Why are the 600 people pictured in the shape of a No. 10 smiling? Simple. They  don't battle the freeways alone each day. These Transamerica Life Co. employees  were marking the 10th anniversary of their van-pooling program.  </P> <P> As they tell drivers in Pasadena: Smile, you're on photo radar.  </P> <P> At 4 p.m. Thursday, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory clocked Voyager 2 at 40,098  m.p.h.  </P> <P> This Week's Sushi Attack:  </P> <P> When last we heard from Bonese Collins Turner, she had a painting showing an  order of sushi pelting the HOLLYWOOD sign, one of a series on display at the  Angel's Gate Gallery in San Pedro. Now comes a similar onslaught on the Theme  Building at Los Angeles International Airport. Weren't the sushi controllers  awake?  </P> <P> Vic (the Brick) Jacobs, the Channel 13 sportscaster with a werewolf's voice,  throws a chunk of foam at the screen when he wants to signify a miserable  performance. Jacobs admits that his next honoree should be . . . himself.  </P> <P> He was playing in a charity softball game in Long Beach the other day when "I  made a sudden move and froze with a pain in my leg," said Jacobs, 36. "I  figured a golf ball had hit me because there's a course nearby."  </P> <P> Jacobs had to sit out the rest of the game. Later, in the locker room, he was  informed that he'd pulled a muscle.  </P> <P> An enterprising worker at a refreshment stand in the Hollywood Bowl set out a  box with a sign that said: "Ten Reasons Why You Should Tip."  </P> <P> Sample reasons:  </P> <P> No. 10: "Elvis did last week."  </P> <P> No. 8: "Minimum wage."  </P> <P> No. 7: "Guilt."  </P> <P> No. 4: "We want to rent a Rob Lowe video."  </P> <P> Guilt was in short supply. When last seen, he had a total of one quarter in his  box.  </P> <P> Give him the brick, Vic.  </P></p>

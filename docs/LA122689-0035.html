			<p><P> December 26, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PENNZOIL RHYMES ITS REASONS TO DISMISS CHEVRON SUIT  </P> <P> Chevron Corp. said Pennzoil Co. had hired a takeover specialist, and Pennzoil  replied with a variation of a Christmas Eve poem Friday as the oil giants  sparred in federal court over Pennzoil's purchase of $2.1 billion in Chevron  stock.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson heard 90 minutes of arguments, some of  them in rhyme, on Pennzoil's attempt to dismiss Chevron's lawsuit. The suit  accuses Pennzoil of concealing a motive to take over Chevron, or force a  restructuring, and seeks to require sale of the stock.  </P> <P> Henderson said he would rule at a later date. He already has ruled that the  suit raises serious enough allegations to require Pennzoil to make its  documents and executives available to Chevron, and he is to decide by Wednesday  whether to prohibit Pennzoil from suing over the same issues anywhere else  without court approval.  </P> <P> Houston-based Pennzoil, the nation's 14th-largest oil company, disclosed two  weeks ago that it had bought 8.8% of the stock of Chevron, the fourth-largest  oil firm.  </P> <P> Pennzoil said it was making a long-term investment for tax purposes and had no  intention of seeking control. But Chevron, in an immediate suit, said Pennzoil  had a history of seeking oil property and was violating federal law that  requires advance notice and a waiting period before major stock purchases that  seek control or a voice in management.  </P> <P> In seeking to dismiss the suit, Pennzoil said Chevron had no evidence for its  claims about Pennzoil's motives and was relying on unfounded speculation.  Pennzoil's lawyer, Stephen Bomse, made the point in verse in his closing  statement to Henderson.  </P> <P> " 'Twas the day before Christmas and all through the court, Chevron was  desperately seeking a tort. But they found no data, no facts they could  mention, nothing to prove a deceptive intention. . . . Who cares if all that we  have is suspicion? We'll tell 'em it's true, based on our intuition.' "  </P> <P> "This discussion," Bomse said more prosaically, "belongs not in a courtroom but  on an analyst's couch."  </P> <P> But Chevron's lawyer, Walter Robinson, said the company had reasons for its  suspicions.  </P> <P> For one thing, he said, Pennzoil needs to buy more Chevron stock to get the  $800-million tax break it says it is after -- enough to put it over the 10%  ownership threshold that would trigger Chevron's "shareholder-rights" plan, one  of several anti-takeover measures Chevron has newly instituted. Among other  things, Chevron's suit seeks a declaration that those measures are legal.  </P> <P> Also, according to a declaration filed with the court on Dec. 7, the same day  Chevron filed suit, an investment banker working for Chevron said he got a call  from Felix Rohatyn, a prominent mergers and acquisitions expert at the  investment firm of Lazard Freres, who said he was representing Pennzoil.  </P> <P> "They're hiring a $6-million man to help them, a man who specializes in  mergers," Robinson said, referring to the amount Rohatyn reportedly made in  1987. " . . . The threat is real."  </P> <P> Bomse told reporters that he didn't know whether Rohatyn was still involved  with Pennzoil, but he certainly wasn't representing Pennzoil during the stock  purchases, at the time the suit was filed, or as recently as a few days ago.  </P> <P> Besides, the lawyer asked Henderson, "is there something now sinister, even if  it were true, about retaining an investment banker?"  </P> <P> Bomse also said there was no need for Henderson to decide the validity of  Chevron's defensive maneuvers, such as the shareholder-rights plan, because  they are already being challenged in five stockholder suits in Delaware, where  the two companies are incorporated, and California.  </P> <P> But Robinson said Pennzoil has already criticized Chevron's measures as an  attempt to entrench company management and would inevitably challenge them in  court.  </P></p>

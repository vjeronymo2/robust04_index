More than 5,000 people were thrown out  of their homes illegally by Croatian security forces during 1992  and 1993, many of them beaten, threatened and robbed in the  process, it said in a report released Tuesday [22 March].  "Despite assurances (...) forced and illegal expulsions, acts of  violence and the absence of all protection for their victims  continues in Croatia," it commented.    The report gave details of 21 cases, including one where the  victim died, and criticised Croatia for not keeping a promise  made in December to open inquiries on the many complaints  brought to the authorities. The victims were Croat citizens or  long-standing residents of non-Croat origin, mostly Serb, who  lived in homes built by the former federal Yugoslav army for  veterans and their families.    Since Croatian independence in 1991, the homes have been  under the control of the Ministry of Defence.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency believes the burden of responsibility for determining whether use of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substitute will be small should reside at the same level as the notification requirement. That  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is, it should be the responsibility of the introducing agent to determine whether use of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particular substitute in a given sector is likely to remain below 10,000 pounds per year. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency continues to believe that focusing the listing decisions on the substitutes sold in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> largest volumes will allow the Agency to target its regulatory efforts to those applications that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offer the maximum risk reduction potential.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many commenters generally supported EPA's exemption for small industrial sectors,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> arguing that the administrative burden imposed by a SNAP review of all possible substitutions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is unjustified by the likely risks posed by these uses. For this final rule, the Agency will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continue to exempt small sectors and small volume uses within major industrial sectors from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reporting responsibilities under SNAP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> e.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Designation of submitters/reporting responsibilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many of the public comments on the NPRM expressed general support for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flexibility of the reporting requirements, noting it is sensible to require notification from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> person most suited to have the relevant information. However, some confusion has arisen as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the implementation and enforcement of these requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency agrees with public comment that the designation of submitters or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reporting responsibility needed clarification in this final rule. For this final rule then,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reporting responsibility rests with the person who introduced the substitute into interstate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commerce in its final form. As such, the producer could potentially be a manufacturer,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> formulator, or an end-user. Identification of designated submitters is further detailed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section IV.B.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> f.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Exemption for second-generation substitutes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many commenters supported EPA's exemption for second-generation substitutes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, several asked for clarification of regulatory language setting out this exemption.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> They note that the definition left plenty of room for advances in the science to calculate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increasingly small contributions to ozone depletion added by hitherto unsuspected compounds,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thereby constantly broadening the scope of SNAP as new concerns develop. They ask that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA clarify that SNAP should only apply to substitutes for class I or class II compounds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA agrees with these comments and has clarified in section IV.A.2.f. that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition of second-generation applies only to substitutes for class I or class II compounds in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. SNAP Determination and Listing Process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Allowing for assured minimum periods of use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Numerous commenters expressed a need for a minimum assured time period of use for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acceptable substitutes in order to facilitate the fastest possible transition away from class I  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substances. Some commenters suggested that this assured minimum period should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established based on some economic measure, such as the lifetime of equipment in which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compound is to be used, or the overall payback period for investment in modifications to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allow the use of a transitional compound. One commenter suggested the use of risk analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to define the assured minimum period. Other commenters suggested 10 years as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency believes Congress enacted provisions under section 612 which make a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimum assured time period for use of a substitute neither authorized nor necessary under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SNAP. As described in section VIII of this final rule, a petition under section 612(d) to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change a listing from acceptable to unacceptable or vice versa must include adequate data. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, any change will be formally promulgated as a rulemaking, which requires EPA to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> propose, take public comment, and complete final action for any decision. If the decision is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> made to change a listing for a substitute from acceptable to unacceptable, the grandfathering  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions of this final rule provide the Agency with the flexibility in appropriate cases to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide time after a substitute is removed from the list of acceptable substitutes to allow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> persons who are then using the substance, or who have expended considerable efforts in good  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> faith toward its use, to find a different substitute and recover their investment in prior  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substitutes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. SNAP Information Form  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Use of global warming potential.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some commenters argue that EPA has no legal authority under section 612 to regulate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substitutes based on global warming. One commenter noted that during the development of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> title VI, Congress deliberately excised global warming from the statute, and that legislative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> history of title VI thus argues against reliance on global warming as a regulatory criterion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under SNAP. Finally, a commenter asserted that not only the Congress, but the President also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that ozone depletion and global warming should be treated separately.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

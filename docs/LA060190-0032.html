			<p><P> June 1, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> ELECTIONS OXNARD;  </P> <P> MAYOR SAYS AUDIT FAVORS POLICE, FIRE REDUCTIONS  </P> <P> As controversy mounts over a management audit designed to uncover the cause of  Oxnard's financial crisis, Mayor Nao Takasugi revealed Thursday that an  auditing firm hired by the city already has suggested drastic cuts to police  and fire services to balance the city's budget.  </P> <P> In individual meetings with council members last month, Cresap Management  Consultants of Washington said the financially stricken city may have to  consider cutting 41 positions -- including 31 sworn officers -- in the Police  Department, eliminate 18 positions in the Fire Department, close two fire  stations and sell some city parks, Takasugi said.  </P> <P> The final management audit, ordered by the city in February, was scheduled to  be released Thursday. But Bill Evans, vice president of Cresap, notified city  officials Wednesday that the report would not be completed until June 19.  </P> <P> At Thursday's council meeting, Takasugi called the proposed cuts unacceptable  and recommended that the council cancel its contract with Cresap for missing  the deadline. The mayor said he is "indignant and appalled" that Cresap waited  until the last minute to notify the city that it would not meet the deadline.  </P> <P> Evans could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Councilman Manuel Lopez agreed with Takasugi, saying the final audit will be  almost meaningless since it will not be submitted to the city before voters go  to the polls Tuesday to decide on a 5% utility tax increase.  </P> <P> Lopez and Takasugi said it is important that voters know the results of the  audit before considering the tax increase, which is designed to ease the city's  financial woes by generating $5 million annually.  </P> <P> City officials said that if approved the revenues generated by the tax would  wipe out an anticipated $2.8-million deficit and eliminate the need for cuts in  services and personnel.  </P> <P> The mayor's proposal to cancel the contract with Cresap failed when council  members voted 2 to 2 on the measure. Councilwomen Dorothy Maron and Geraldine  (Gerry) Furr opposed the proposal. Councilwoman Ann Johs was absent.  </P> <P> Maron and Furr said they opposed the measure because they believe that the city  is partly to blame for the audit's delay. They said Cresap was forced to do  additional work on the audit after council members and city staff members  raised several concerns about it.  </P> <P> Although Cresap had asked the council to extend the deadline until June 19, it  voted to take no further action until its next regular meeting Tuesday.  </P> <P> City Atty. Gary Gillig said the city is obligated to pay $72,000 for the  preliminary audit but does not have to pay an additional $175,000 for the  uncompleted final audit.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, opponents of the tax measure accused the council of purposely  delaying the audit. Others maintained that a draft copy of the audit had been  completed and shown to city officials. City officials deny the allegations.  </P> <P> Scott Bollinger, a self-employed investor who has announced that he will run  for the council in November, said he talked to Cresap representatives who told  him on Tuesday that a draft copy was prepared, although he said they would not  tell him whether city officials have seen it. Bollinger and Paul K. Dolan, also  a council candidate, have mailed a letter to the U.S. attorney general's office  asking for an investigation.  </P> <P> In an interview Thursday, Police Chief Robert Owens said Cresap officials last  week gave him a section of a draft audit report dealing with the Police  Department and said he believes several other department heads received similar  reports. Owens refused to say what was included in the report.  </P> <P> Bill Lewis, president of the Oxnard Peace Officers Assn. and an outspoken  supporter of the tax measure, said at the council meeting that Cresap must have  considered only financial savings when it made the recommendations for cuts but  did not consider the impact on Oxnard residents.  </P> <P> Marc L. Charney, an attorney and Oxnard Chamber of Commerce member, accused  council members of capitalizing on gloomy fiscal reports to persuade voters to  approve the tax increase.  </P> <P> "You are using this meeting as a campaign rally or political advertisement" for  the tax measure, he said.  </P> <P> Amid the discussion about personnel reductions, there was only a brief  explanation for the city's financial crisis.  </P> <P> In an interview after the meeting, City Manager David Mora said Cresap  representatives told council members last month that the crisis came about  because of inadequate revenue to pay for city services. Mora, however, said  Cresap did not say why the city is facing a revenue shortfall.  </P> <P> Mora has said the fiscal crisis was partly created in 1987 when the City  Council eliminated a 4% utility tax two years before it was set to end. That  alone has cost the city between $4.5 and $5 million a year, he said.  </P></p>

			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets: Manila enjoys benefit of renewed overseas interest - The rally in Philippine equities Philippine equities have been enjoying a rally recently as foreign investors have been active buyers of the market. Although the composite index yesterday fell back slightly, closing at 1,954, the mood remains bullish. In the past week the index has set a succession of record highs, closing on Monday at 1,978.81. A surge in turnover, to a daily average of 720m pesos last week, has also fortified support for historic highs for selected commercial-industrial counters. During the previous 'mini-boom' in May, average turnover was 510m pesos a day, which slowed down to some 450m in the succeeding months. Analysts had been anticipating profit-taking in early September after the market reached record levels in late-August. Since the index broke through the May peak on August 23, however, the advance has been sustained by strong buying support. Obervers had expected a slowdown in the rally to coincide with the return on September 7 of the body of Mr Ferdinand Marcos, the former Philippine president, ousted from office in 1986 and forced to flee to Hawaii, where he lived in exile until his death in 1989. However, lean crowds turned up at the Marcos homecoming and funeral, which bolstered earlier assessments by government officials that the former dictator and his supporters were really 'a spent force'. Analysts also cited the Philippine GNP figures reported late last week as a positive factor for shares. According to government data, GNP grew by 1.8 per cent in the first half, after remaining mainly stagnant since 1990. Providing the most inspiration to the market's recent advance has been PLDT, which has also been moving up in New York where it is listed as an ADR. Brokers say US investors have found the stock an attractive buy among the telecommunications groups traded on Wall Street. Another active issue, beer and food giant San Miguel, has seen the 'B' shares rise to 150 pesos, from 136 pesos in late-August. Analysts see the 'excess liquidity' in the financial system as a factor that could favour the market over the short term, even if a rise in interest rates soon could provide a dampener. A reversal of the recent decline in Treasury bill rates, which had become the benchmark for commercial lending rates, has started diverting funds back into the money market, according to brokers. The government is rumoured to be planning a cut in the volume of T-bills being auctioned weekly. That, however, does not change the budgetary gaps that the government will continue to contend with, and which it had filled in the past with huge borrowings through Treasury bill flotations. The recent softness of the peso rate against the US dollar, which could continue in the next few weeks as industries increase imports of raw materials ahead of the seasonal year-end rise in consumer purchases, has also lured investible funds away from equities, finance executives admit. The peso has dropped by some 8 per cent since the beginning of the year, in spite of occasional central bank intervention in forex trading. The Manila market has been trading at a price/earnings multiple of around 15 in recent weeks, which local brokers still view as a competitive level in the Asian context. While economic growth for 1993 is now conceded to be slower than earlier targets, an improvement in the power situation is expected to provide a boost next year. Daily power outages have been shortened to about four hours (from six-to-eight hours three months ago), thanks to the commissioning of some of the so-called 'fast-track' power plants built over the past 12 months. A central bank survey early this year showed that optimism over prospects for the second half of this year ran high among industries based in metro Manila. Many of these industries, according to the survey, were also making expansion plans. The stock market is also expected to gain from the projected link-up in the computerised trading operations of the two local exchanges. The interconnection will result in a 'one-price market' for equities, as against different prices quoted at the two exchanges. Market capitalisation is also expected to gain further towards the year-end with the expected new listing of at least five companies, along with an additional offering of 2.5bn pesos by Meralco, whose initial listing early last year was among the most successful locally.</p>

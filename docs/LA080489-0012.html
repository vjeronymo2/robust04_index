			<p><P> August 4, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ESCONDIDO, RINCON REACH ACCORD ON FIRE, PARAMEDIC PROTECTION  </P> <P> Warring factions in a battle over fire and paramedic services have approved a  pact that will give about 13,500 Escondido-area residents uninterrupted  emergency services from now on.  </P> <P> The rural residents who live outside Escondido city limits faced the loss of  city fire services after the Rincon Del Diablo Municipal Water District  requested, and the Escondido City Council approved, cancellation of a five-year  pact under which the city provided the emergency services along the city's  southern boundaries and in unincorporated residential pockets to the north of  town.  </P> <P> The water district's board and council members unanimously approved the new  agreement Wednesday night after residents in the outlying areas had told both  bodies in angry terms that it was time to forget their differences and strike a  compromise.  </P> <P> Both the City Council, which last week had voted to cancel the fire services  contract, and the Rincon board, which earlier had requested the contract  cancellation, expressed satisfaction with the new pact.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Voice in the Operation  </P> <P> Fred Adjarian, water district general manager, said the agreement will allow  water board members to have a say in the operation of the city's fire-paramedic  services to their rural customers and to arbitrate any major problems that may  arise.  </P> <P> Without that, Adjarian explained, the rural residents would be subjected to  "taxation without representation." Rural customers pay $72 a year for city  emergency services, but have no vote in city elections.  </P> <P> Another issue that had separated the two agencies was settled when Rincon  agreed to withdraw from an automatic aid agreement with several other fire  departments, including Deer Springs. Escondido fire officials had requested the  cancellation of all automatic aid pacts because it requires city firefighters  to respond to distant rural fires, leaving urban areas of the city unprotected.  </P></p>

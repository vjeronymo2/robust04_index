			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA JUDGE TO DECIDE IF DNA HOLDS UP IN COURT  </P> <P> Law enforcement officials in California are awaiting the decision of a Ventura  Superior Court judge on whether to allow evidence from a new and controversial  scientific technique called DNA "fingerprinting" into a murder trial.  </P> <P> Although courts in 13 states have admitted evidence from the technique, no  California court has done so. If Judge Lawrence Storch decides to admit the  evidence, his decision would set a precedent for other courts in the state.  </P> <P> Ventura County Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury wants to use the technique to  establish the identity of the person who fatally stabbed George White, a  63-year-old handyman, last year at a Ventura hamburger stand.  </P> <P> Storch ordered the hearing, which began Monday, to determine whether DNA test  results are sufficiently accurate to allow as evidence. Because of the  complexity of the case and the difficulty in scheduling testimony from  scientific experts, the hearing is expected to continue into April.  </P> <P> The hearing has drawn prosecutors and defense attorneys from outside Ventura  County as spectators. They are preparing for trials in which DNA fingerprinting  may be sought as evidence.  </P> <P> DNA, which stands for deoxyribonucleic acid, is found in the cells of human  tissue, such as blood, hair, skin or semen. Scientists say they can translate  the extremely intricate genetic makeup of tissue into DNA patterns that  resemble supermarket bar codes. The chances of two people having the same DNA  structure are more than a billion to one, said Carol J. Nelson, the senior  deputy district attorney who is prosecuting the first-degree murder case  against Lynda Axell, 34.  </P> <P> Ventura County prosecutors have spent a year preparing for the hearing and are  flying in molecular biologists and other experts from around the country.  </P> <P> "There will be nothing spared," Bradbury said. "It's important that a  significant foundation be laid so that the admissibility of DNA be unassailable  on appeal."  </P> <P> On Monday, Richard Roberts, a molecular biologist who is assistant director for  research at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York, testified that the DNA  patterns from hair belonging to Axell identically matched the DNA patterns from  15 hairs found at Top Hat Burger after White's slaying.  </P> <P> The Harvard-trained biologist also testified that DNA fingerprinting is used  regularly in genetic research.  </P> <P> White was killed on Feb. 24, 1988. Axell, who worked at a costume shop on the  same block and has admitted that she is a crack addict, was allegedly linked to  the crime by a police informant. She has maintained her innocence and sits  quietly, dressed in white, as the hearing inches forward.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, San Diego defense attorney Patricia W. Robinson took notes. She  said she is preparing for a death penalty case in which the prosecution is  seeking to introduce DNA evidence that purportedly would link her client to a  San Diego murder.  </P> <P> In that case, the prosecution is trying to introduce such evidence based on one  hair, she said.  </P> <P> "I question the methods, and the way the sample is stored and if it's  destroyed. This technology is just too new," Robinson said.  </P> <P> At times, the Ventura courtroom resembled a high school biology class as the  molecular biologists explained such terms as loci, restriction enzymes, the  twinned DNA helix and electrophoresis.  </P> <P> In the typing process, DNA is extracted from the cells, cut into fragments by  an enzyme and separated into bands using electrophoresis -- a well-established  procedure that scatters the DNA with an electric current.  </P> <P> The resulting DNA pattern is transferred onto a nylon membrane. X-ray film and  radioactive chemicals that bind with specific DNA sequences are then applied to  make the bands visible to the naked eye. These bands, which record DNA patterns  that are different for each individual, are known as the DNA fingerprint.  </P> <P> The test was developed in 1985 by Alec Jeffreys, a geneticist at the University  of Leicester in England. It was first used in a celebrated British case in  which a Leicester-area baker named Colin Pitchfork was  </P> <P> found guilty of raping and strangling two 15-year-old girls. That case is the  subject of a new book, "The Blooding," by ex-policeman and best-selling writer  Joseph Wambaugh.  </P> <P> Willard P. Wiksell, one of Axell's two court-appointed attorneys, said he  believes that the scientific procedure has "a number of flaws."  </P> <P> "The day has not yet arrived when you can look at a hair found on the floor and  say it came from a specific individual," Wiksell said. He compared DNA  technology to lie detector tests and voice analysis machines, which have been  disallowed in many courts.  </P> <P> "It's a brand-new procedure. It just hasn't had the scrutiny, and most of the  people who are in favor of it have a financial interest in it," he said.  </P> <P> He and James M. Farley, Axell's other attorney, said they plan to call their  own experts to discredit Nelson's experts.  </P> <P> The defense, which is not cross-examining the prosecution witnesses this week,  has asked for more time to research the case. The attorneys have received  Storch's approval to cross-examine Nelson's experts in their labs, which are in  Berkeley, Washington and New York. The testimony will be recorded both by a  video camera and a court stenographer.  </P> <P> The hearing will then reconvene in Ventura. The defense will play the  videotaped evidence for Storch, call its own witnesses and join Nelson in  closing arguments. Only then will the judge issue his decision.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, law enforcement officials in California are already hailing the  technique.  </P> <P> "It's the most significant development since fingerprints," Bradbury said. "It  retains our life codes. It's proof beyond any possible doubt."  </P> <P> State Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp has called DNA a major breakthrough in  crime-solving.  </P> <P> A second trial involving DNA fingerprinting is expected to start next month in  Orange County.  </P> <P> Charges were filed against 41-year-old rape and burglary suspect Danny Harris  after DNA tests allegedly matched tissue found at the crime scene with his  tissue.  </P> <P> </P> <P> DNA FINGERPRINTING  </P> <P> DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is found in cells of human tissue such as blood,  hair, skin or semen. Scientists say the genetic makeup of tissue can be  translated into intricate DNA patterns, and the chances of two people having  identical DNA structure are more than a billion to one.  </P></p>

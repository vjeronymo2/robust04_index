			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At the time the proposed rule was published, the California linderiella was known from vernal pools in the Central Valley from central Tehama County to central Madera County and across the valley in the Sacramento area to the central and south coast mountains from Lake County south to Riverside County. Surveys conducted in 1993 and other information that has become available to the Service indicate that the range extends from Shasta County south to Fresno County and across the valley to the Coast and Transverse Ranges from Willits in Mendocino County south to near Sulfur Mountain in Ventura County. Within this area more vernal pools have been found to contain subpopulations of the California linderiella than was known at the time of the proposed rule. The populations in Riverside County have been determined to represent an undescribed species of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Linderiella.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service has carefully considered the additional information and has determined that the California linderiella fails to meet the definition of either an endangered or threatened species and has withdrawn it from consideration for endangered or threatened status. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 12:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After the comment period closed, six parties requested that the Service extend the date of the final determination for these species pursuant to 16 U.S.C. 1533(b)(6). That section of the Act provides for a six-month extension to solicit additional data if the Secretary finds that ``there is substantial disagreement regarding the sufficiency or accuracy of the available data relevant to the determination.'' The parties asserted that additional information on the range and status of these animals could become available during this time period. One of these commenters submitted a report as the basis for their request that summarized museum, literature, and field records, the majority of which were collected in 1993, for the five species (Sugnet and Associates 1993b). A seventh party, the California Native Plant Society, stated that they were opposed to the six month extension and they urged the Service to immediately list the five species. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The report by Sugnet and Associates (1993b) provided a number of records for the California linderiella, vernal pool fairy shrimp, and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp that have been incorporated into this final rule. The report listed 3092 ``discrete locations'' that contained 703 records of the California linderiella, 178 records of the vernal pool fairy shrimp, and 345 records of the vernal pool tadpole shrimp. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The report by Sugnet and Associates (1993b) presented only township and range information on the locations of the California linderiella, vernal pool fairy shrimp, longhorn fairy shrimp, Conservancy fairy shrimp, and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp. A request by the California Department of Fish and Game to obtain the precise locations that served as the basis for the report was unsuccessful (letter from California Department of Fish and Game to Sugnet and Associates, dated December 29, 1993; letter from Sugnet and Associates to California Department of Fish and Game, dated January 29, 1994). The report also treated the records of the individual vernal pools inhabited by the California linderiella, vernal pool fairy shrimp, and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp as ``discrete locations.'' However, as described in greater detail in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Background  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> section, abundance of inhabited vernal pool complexes most appropriately describes the population status of the five vernal pool crustaceans; animals in individual pools most appropriately are referred to as subpopulations. Accordingly, the study by Sugnet and Associates (1993b) overestimated the number of populations of the California linderiella, vernal pool fairy shrimp, and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp. Statements in Sugnet and Associates (1993b), such as ``Results of this effort indicate that  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> B. lynchi  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> occurs at a total of 178 discrete locations *&blank;*&blank;*'', should be interpreted in light of the fact that a number of inhabited pools can occur within a single vernal pool complex, and that all of these could be threatened by a single project proposal. For example, the proposed Sunrise-Douglas development in Sacramento County contains over 500 vernal pools (Sugnet and Associates 1993a). An unknown number of these pools contain the vernal pool fairy shrimp, and/or vernal pool tadpole shrimp. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The data in Sugnet and Associates (1993b) and other information available to the Service increased the known ranges and number of populations from that described in the proposed rule for three of the five species and located additional populations for one species. The report identified a geographic range extension for the vernal pool tadpole shrimp and increased the number of populations from fourteen to seventeen; none were from unexpected areas or non-vernal pool habitat. Two additional populations of the Conservancy fairy shrimp were located, one at the Sacramento National Wildlife Refuge and one in northern Ventura County. The geographic distribution of the vernal pool fairy shrimp was not increased but additional pools containing this species were located within the known range and known populations of this animal. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

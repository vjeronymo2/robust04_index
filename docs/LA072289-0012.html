			<p><P> July 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SYMBOLIC EXPRESSIONS: SHOULD CONFEDERATE FLAG BE BANNED?  </P> <P> Raskin's column delivers an extremely simplified version of the Civil War, not  unlike a Classic Comic version of "Hamlet." He has boiled the Civil War down  solely to the issue of slavery vs. emancipation. This is a view too often held  these days by many who are lacking education in Southern history. He failed to  recognize that the seeds of the Civil War were planted during the nullification  crisis of 1832, when North Carolina refused to comply with taxation that  unfairly burdened Southerners and provided newly constructed roads for  Northerners.  </P> <P> Raskin wrote, "It (the Confederate flag) was flown by those states that  conspired to bring down the U.S. government through an act of war." The  Confederate States of America did not wish to "bring down" the U.S. government,  but wished to peacefully coexist. He failed to mention that President Lincoln  refused to open negotiations with the Confederate government regarding Fort  Sumter. He failed to mention that the Confederate government offered to let  merchant ships into the harbor to sell goods but were refused.  </P> <P> Why was it that in a nation born of rebellion to its British rulers, less than  100 later people who sought a peaceful escape from the constant maligning of  their constitutional rights were destroyed?  </P> <P> The Confederate flag is not a symbol of slavery to all, and for those to whom  it is, I pity. I hope that Raskin realizes someday that flying the flag of the  Confederacy can be a memorial to those who sought to protect their rights under  a Constitution that they thought would protect them but failed. It is a part of  this nation's history which we cannot ignore, but should be remembered in hopes  that we can learn from it.  </P> <P> ERIKA LAIRD TEMM  </P> <P> Covina  </P></p>

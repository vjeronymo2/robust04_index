			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Waterford Foods' IPounds 25m rights to finance buy WATERFORD FOODS, the Irish dairy and foods group, has announced an IPounds 25m (Pounds 23.3m) rights issue to part-finance its IPounds 62m purchase of Express Ireland from Grand Metropolitan. The 34m new A ordinary shares will be issued on a 2-for-9 basis at 74p apiece. Waterford Co-op, the principal shareholder in the group, holding 79 per cent of the existing 153m shares, will only subscribe for 8m shares of the issue. This will effectively dilute its holding to about 69 per cent. Brokers in Dublin said there had been much interest shown by institutional investors in the issue, with the price being regarded as cheap. Waterford shares closed at 76p on the Dublin Stock Exchange last Friday. Waterford's acquisition of Express puts the group alongside Dairygold as the biggest milk processor in Ireland. It is the latest step in a rapid expansion plan which has been in train since 1989. Then, Waterford purchased Healds Foods, near Manchester, followed by Galloway West in Wisconsin in the US in 1990, and United Co-operative Dairies in northern England last year. In total, the group has spent an estimated IPounds 200m on these acquisitions. In announcing the issue, Mr Stephen O'Connor, managing director, said: 'We believe that the time is appropriate to raise new equity to expand the capital base of the group and position it for further developments'.</p>

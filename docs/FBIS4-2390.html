			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, April 11 (XINHUA) -- The Bosnian Serb  military command last night strongly protested against an  earlier NATO air strike and decided to suspend all its contacts  with the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROROR) in the  former Yugoslavia.    NATO's two American F-16 warplanes bombed artillery  positions  of the Serb forces south and southeast of Gorazde, a  Serb-besieged Muslim enclave, yesterday evening.    It was the first time during the two-year Bosnian war that  the United Nations requested attacks on ground positions. In  late February, NATO war planes shot down four Serb aircraft  which violated the "no-fly zone" over Bosnia.    The attack, launched under the U.N. request, aimed to  protect  12 U.N. military observers in the Gorazde region from threatened  Serb shellings, said the U.S. Defense Ministry [as received].    However, the headquarters of the Serb forces said in a  statement that there was no threat at all to the UNPROFOR in  Gorazde and the NATO air attack was "groundless." Therefore the  raid had led the United Nations into the civil war of Bosnia, it  added.    The statement noted that NATO's attack was mounted to rescue  the Muslims from defeat in their spring offensives and to block  the realization of the Serb proposal for a "perpetual ceasefire  throughout Bosnia."    The Serb statement went on to say that the U.N. action was  one for encouraging the Muslim forces, whose aim in launching  the offensive was to provoke Serbs' counter-attacks and make  them a pretext for foreign military intervention.    In conclusion, the statement said that the Serbs were not to  be cowed but would use every possible means to defend themselves.</p>

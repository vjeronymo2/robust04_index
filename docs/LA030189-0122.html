			<p><P> March 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRADE DEFICIT SWELLS TO $32 BILLION IN 4TH QUARTER  </P> <P> The U.S. trade deficit worsened in the final three months of the year, climbing  to $32 billion, as U.S. exports and imports hit record levels, the government  reported Tuesday.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department said the deficit from October through December swelled  10% from a third-quarter deficit of $29.17 billion.  </P> <P> The trade deficit had shown steady improvement through the first three quarters  of 1988, helping to push the deficit for the entire year down to $126.5  billion, 21.7% below the all-time high of $160.28 billion set in 1987.  </P> <P> Although economists were pleased with the big improvement for the year, they  expressed fears that the improvement has stalled and will hold back overall  economic growth in 1989.  </P> <P> "The trade deficit has stopped improving," said David Wyss, an economist with  Data Resources Inc. of Lexington, Mass. "We made some big gains in exports in  1987 and 1988, but they haven't been enough to balance our big appetite for  imports."  </P> <P> Tuesday's figures confirmed an improvement noted in the Commerce Department's  monthly merchandise trade reports. Those figures showed the deficit declining  to $137.34 billion in 1988, down from $170.3 billion in 1987.  </P> <P> The new report, which measures trade on a balance-of-payments basis, has  smaller figures because it subtracts shipping costs and military sales.  </P> <P> Another measure of trade, contained in the report on the gross national product  released Tuesday, also showed a worsening in the deficit for fourth quarter  1988. Unlike the other trade figures, the GNP report removes the effects of  inflation from the import and export numbers.  </P></p>

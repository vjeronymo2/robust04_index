			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vadim Byrkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 2 Mar -- During the last 24 hours the  Azerbaijani side has again violated the armistice mediated by  the Russian defense minister, the NKR's [Nagorno-Karabakh  Republic] information and press department told ITAR-TASS today.    Quoting the press service of the NKR defense army, it said  that during the 24-hour period, in spite of the cease-fire  agreement which came into force on 1 March, Azerbaijani  artillery repeatedly shelled Karabakh defensive positions in the  north of Mardakertskiy Rayon. Last night, the same source says,  Azerbaijani infantry attacked Karabakh positions at the village  of Berdashen in Martuninskiy Rayon. The attack was beaten off.  This morning positions along the line between the villages of  Dastakert and Tonashen in Mardakertskiy rayon were also shelled.  In view of this Stepanakert fears that the other side may use  the armistice to prepare for a new, large-scale offensive. The  command of the NKR defense army has instructed its forces not to  retaliate, if possible.</p>

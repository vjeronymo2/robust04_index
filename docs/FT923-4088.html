			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Hizbollah and allies sweep to victory in south Lebanon HIZBOLLAH, the Iranian-backed Shia Moslem group and Amal, its Syrian supported ally, yesterday completed their electoral triumph in Lebanon, virtually sweeping the 23 seats contested in the third round of voting held in the south of the country. After strong showings in both the east of Lebanon and in Beirut, the 22 candidates of Hizbollah and Amal on the so-called 'Liberation List' were elected along with a solitary Sunni Moslem independent from Sidon. Mr Nabih Berri, Amal movement leader, Sunni Moslem Bahiya Hariri and two Hizbollah (party of God) candidates topped the list of parliamentarians elected in what was the final phase of the first general election for 20 years. The victory for the 'Liberation List', which campaigned on a platform of toppling south Lebanon's traditional leaders, was made easier by the refusal by the Christian communities to take part in the poll. Moslem fundamentalists appear certain to be the largest ideologically coherent group in the new parliament and their success reflects similar trends elsewhere in the Middle East, most notably in Algeria. The Christian minority, which had until the civil war dominated the country politically, boycotted the election claiming that it could not be fair while Syrian troops remained in Lebanon. They subsequently charged that the voting in each round had been rigged. Under the reformed constitution the Moslem and Christian communities were due to share the seats equally in the legislature. However, the size of the victory of the Shia parties confirms what had been increasingly obvious since the outbreak of the civil war in 1975: that a redrawing of the Lebanese political map would inevitably give greater weight to the under-represented south and the urban poor. Israel and the US attempted individually and jointly to stem the political tide by shoring up the Christian Maronite minority during the first half of the 1980s, without success. With Lebanon participating in the Middle East peace process due to resume in Washington next week, the political complexion of the parliament becomes of greater importance should there be significant progress in the separate talks between Israel, the Palestinians and Syria. Israel insists that it has no territorial claim to any part of Lebanon, but is unlikely to withdraw from the swathe of land it controls in the south until it has reached broad agreement with Syria on the Golan Heights. If Israel is to withdraw from Golan, or a large part of it, it would clearly hope to negotiate a parallel withdrawal of Syria troops from eastern Lebanon. Although the success of Hizbollah and Amal might fairly reflect the mood of the most deprived section of Lebanon's population, there are also fears that it could spark a renewed burst of extremism.</p>

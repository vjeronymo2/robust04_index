			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Imre Konya by Petan in </F> Pilisvorosvar on 17 April: "A Decision Must Be Made"]    [Text] Interior Minister Imre Konya visited the  Pilis-basin on 17 April, and then participated in a rally  organized by the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] and the  National Federation of Political Prisoners [POFOSZ] in  Pilisvorosvar. After his program, Imre Konya gave an interview  to UJ MAGYARORSZAG.    [Petan] Mr. Konya! In view of the presentation of  candidates, in your opinion, to what extent will the national  forces scatter?    [Konya] No doubt, it is dangerous that there are parties,  like Jozsef Torgyan and Istvan Csurka's parties, that can take  votes away from the MDF with their radical formulations against  the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP]. Because they will hardly  be able to exceed the 5 percent threshold, they will actually  give their votes to those against whom they are taking a stand.  After the presentation of candidates, one can conclude that  there is less danger in connection with the Hungarian Justice  and Life Party [MIEP], because they failed to present candidates  in many counties, and this means that they will definitely  remain under the 5 percent threshold. Therefore, whoever votes  for them will actually support the other side.    [Petan] The prime minister has repeatedly stressed recently  that it is impossible to envisage any talks with the Alliance of  Free Democrats [SZDSZ] as long as a tough core leads this party.  What if the hard core is forced out of the leadership?    [Konya] I do not think it is tactful to engage in  speculations regarding the internal affairs of another party.  It is a fact that there is a border line, because the SZDSZ  made it clear that they do not regard a coalition with the MSZP  as impossible. For us, however, it is clear that we will not  form a coalition with the MSZP under any circumstances. At the  same time, I would also like to say that, among the current  SZDSZ deputies, there are people who cannot envisage a coalition  government with the MSZP, and I know these people. Let me also  say that, in the course of the elections, the voters should not  rely on their emotions. A decision must be made. The coming  years will tell whether we can realize our opportunities and  catch up with the West. There is no time for jumping back and  forth, and there is no time for changing governments around.  Therefore, what is at stake in these elections is whether we can  continue on the road we have started or whether we turn back.  MDF or MSZP? Those who are afraid should be told that everyone  goes into the voting booth alone and the elections are secret.  I hope that the healthy instinct of the nation will prevail if  everyone goes to vote. One cannot imagine that people would  vote against their own interests.    [Petan] What is your opinion about the order of the Finance  Ministry according to which, beginning with 1 May, everyone who  enters Hungary must show that he possesses 5,000 forints or an  equivalent sum in hard currency? This regulation affects many  poor Transylvanians and ethnic Hungarians living beyond our  borders who do not come here to trade goods or do any  business....    [Konya] It is difficult to find a balance between the  interests of the public security of the country and the border  areas and keeping contact with these people. Obviously, we will  not introduce a visa requirement for public security reasons,  but the situation requires certain measures. It is unfortunate  that contacts between people become more difficult as a result;  therefore, we are constantly following the developments and we  will stop this new requirement as soon as the situation makes  this possible.</p>

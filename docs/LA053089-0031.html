			<p><P> May 30, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> LEVERT BRIEF BUT INTENSE IN FREE R&amp;B CONCERT  </P> <P> Time got so tight from drawn-out equipment changes at the Miller Sound Express  concert Sunday afternoon that members of the vocal trio LeVert, the headliners,  were warning the crowd about "having to cut it (the set) short" during the  introduction to the group's second song. But that logistical problem was the  only real drawback to the free event before about 10,000 contemporary R&amp;B  fans at Jackie Robinson Stadium near Dorsey High in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> This appearance was the second in a summer-long series of weekend concerts  scheduled to bring the Sound Express semi-truck (which contains the stage) to  outdoor locations around the country. It was a relaxed afternoon for the  casually dressed crowd that ranged from toddlers to the middle-aged to sprawl  on the football field, stroll around and check out a handful of T-shirts and  food booths.  </P> <P> But much of the audience had left by the time LeVert reached the stage for a  20-minute set that compensated in intensity for the brevity. The blend of  forceful hip- hop rhythms and the gruff Philly soul vocals of lead singer  Gerald LeVert was a strong, crowd-pleasing combination. It helped that the  trio's four-song performance included "Casanova," one of those classics that  appeal to head, heart and hips in equal measure.  </P> <P> Second-billed Cherrelle miscalculated by including three ballads in her  five-song, 30-minute set. The Minneapolis-based vocalist's singing soared  soulfully and her 10-piece backing band offered the day's most sophisticated,  ornate arrangements but the crowd was more eager to clap along to harder-edged  funk tracks. Radiant realized that and made a favorable impression with an  uptempo blend of go go-influenced funk spiced with limber dance moves. DON  SNOWDEN  </P></p>

He said that its program could  be seriously changed by the death in the family of the U.S.  President. Despite this, it is envisaged that the first day of  the talks will have a bilateral Czech-U.S. character, while the  second day of the visit will be devoted to consultations with  representatives of other Visegrad countries.    As to the much discussed question of our relation toward  NATO, Josef Zieleniec said:    [Begin Zieleniec recording] The fact is that we are  seriously  discussing with our Western partners, and thus also with the  United States, our future membership, and we are expecting a  statement saying that NATO is an open alliance.

			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading CONCERN over both the US and UK economies led to nervous trading which brought a retreat in stock index futures on the first day of the new account, writes Joel Kibazo. A survey from the Institute of Directors indicating doubts about the UK economic recovery led to nervous trading from the outset as the September Footsie contract opened at 2,857, though it was at a premium to the cash market. However, the premium was eroded within the first half-hour of trading as strong selling drove the contract down to 2,839 as worries about the economy took hold. Poor data on UK money supply and consumer credit kept the contract subdued for the rest of the session, only occasionally trading at a premium to cash. It closed at the day's low of 2,837, a 7-point discount to its fair value premium to cash, which fell to 7 points on this account. Volume was a reasonable 8,840 contracts. Good business in Asda stock options boosted total option turnover yesterday to 30,686 contracts. It traded 7,640 lots, with most of that total coming from the July 67 puts. It was followed by BT at 2,107 and then by British Gas with a day's total of 1,108 lots. The list of active stock options also included Hanson and Lonrho. Just over 8,000 contracts were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option and 4,933 were traded in the Euro FT-SE 100 option.</p>

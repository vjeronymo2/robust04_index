			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> CHINA TAKES A TIP FROM THE WEST  </P> <P> After years of debate, official China has bowed to one more once-taboo  capitalist practice -- tipping.  </P> <P> A fast-food restaurant run by American and Chinese managers in reformist city  Tianjin has gotten the go-ahead to test out tipping.  </P> <P> The official Beijing Review magazine said Saturday that servers who once  recoiled in shock at being given a tip now take the money "as a matter of  course." There are indications, the magazine said, of a more flexible official  policy.  </P> <P> But as foreigners in China have learned, taxi-drivers and other tourism workers  made their policy decision a long time ago.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. P. Fedosov, Institute of Optico-Neuron </F> Technologies, Russian Academy of Sciences; UDC  621.383-181.48:621.3.049.77]    [Abstract] This article obtains analytical expressions for  the optical transfer function of a matrix of backlit photodiodes  (a ``flip chip''), with a consideration of cross-interactions  and the discrete positioning of sensitive matrix elements. A  method of solving the problem of converting the spatial  frequencies of an optical image with a multi-element  photoreceptor matrix is developed. The method is based on  construction of an effect function. Figures 2; references 3  (Russian).</p>

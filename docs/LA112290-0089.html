			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WOMAN WHO LURED 2 GIRLS FOR KILLER IS FOUND GUILTY;  </P> <P> COURTS: MARCIA LYNN RAMOS IS CONVICTED OF SECOND-DEGREE MURDER. JURORS REJECT  DEFENSE CLAIMS THAT SHE WAS AS MUCH A VICTIM OF ROLAND NORMAN COMTOIS AS WERE  THE TWO CHATSWORTH TEEN-AGERS.  </P> <P> Jurors on Wednesday convicted a woman of second-degree murder for her part in  helping a drifter kill a Chatsworth girl and shoot and sexually assault her  companion.  </P> <P> But the jury spared Marcia Lynn Ramos, 36, from the possibility of death in the  gas chamber by acquitting her of first-degree murder.  </P> <P> Ramos sat expressionless as the clerk read the eight verdicts, reached after  eight days of deliberations that followed a 3 1/2-week trial in San Fernando  Superior Court. Members of the victims' families later said they were satisfied  with the verdicts, despite the conviction on the lesser murder charge.  </P> <P> "I'm glad she won't be out for a long, long time," said Lynne Masuhara, mother  of the slain girl, 14-year-old Wendy Masuhara. "I didn't expect her to get  first-degree" murder.  </P> <P> Masuhara said she was not disappointed that Ramos will not face the death  penalty. She said she was most concerned that Ramos not walk away from the  trial a free person.  </P> <P> The mother of the surviving girl said outside the courtroom: "I am so pleased  that it's over with. I'm pleased about the verdict. They did find her guilty  and she is going to pay for it."  </P> <P> In addition to convicting Ramos of second-degree murder, the jury found her  guilty of attempted second-degree murder, three sexual assault charges, two  counts of kidnaping and a count of furnishing a minor with cocaine.  </P> <P> She could have faced the death penalty or life in prison without the  possibility of parole if convicted of first-degree murder and three "special  circumstances," including the allegation that the murder occurred in the course  of a kidnaping.  </P> <P> Jurors said after the verdict that they had difficulty believing the defense's  claim that Ramos was as much a victim of killer Roland Norman Comtois as were  the two girls. But they also said they did not believe the prosecution's  position that Ramos intended to have the girls killed when she lured them into  Comtois' camper on a Chatsworth street late on Sept. 18, 1987.  </P> <P> Comtois, 61, was sentenced in July to die in the gas chamber for his part in  the crime.  </P> <P> Several jurors said they thought that if Ramos were truly a victim, she would  have tried to flee or yell for help when she exited the camper to lure the  girls inside. Ramos, a convicted prostitute who said Comtois supplied her with  cocaine while she lived with him in the camper for nearly two months, testified  that Comtois pointed a gun at her and threatened to kill her if she did not  comply with his wishes.  </P> <P> Though the verdict was not what either the prosecution or the defense had  sought, both sides expressed satisfaction. While she was saved from the gas  chamber, Ramos still faces 55 to 70 years in prison when she is sentenced Jan.  25, according to estimates by both sides.  </P> <P> "She isn't going anywhere," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Rosalie L. Morton, who  substituted for trial prosecutor Harold S. Lynn at Wednesday's verdict reading.  </P> <P> "It's a victory to us that we saved her life and that she didn't get convicted  of first-degree murder," said Alex R. Kessel, one of Ramos' two court-appointed  defense lawyers. "We put on all the evidence we could."  </P> <P> The kidnaping took place as the girls were walking in their Chatsworth  neighborhood to meet several friends at the corner of Devonshire Street and  Lurline Avenue. Ramos emerged from the camper and asked them to help her start  it. After they entered the vehicle, Comtois pointed a gun at them, tied them up  and gagged them, the surviving victim, who was 13 at the time, testified.  </P> <P> After sexually assaulting the 13-year-old, he drove the girls to remote Woolsey  Canyon Road west of Canoga Park, placed them in an abandoned station wagon and  shot both in the head. Masuhara died instantly, but the other girl survived  because her upraised hand deflected the bullet.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Keynote address by Shinyasu Hoshino, chairman of the </F> National Institute for Research Advancement, at a symposium  cosponsored by the Takugin Research Institute and EKONOMISUTO in  Sapporo Grand Hotel, Sapporo City, on 8 September on the theme  of "Japan's Perspective Toward the Year 2010"]    [Text] Recently, when viewing the tides of the world, I  make it a point to think from angles represented by three words  which all begin with "S." The first is "south" which implies the  South-North issue. The second word is "speed." The realization  of an information-oriented society will further progress, and in  10 to 15 years from now all means of communications are expected  to have about doubled their present speeds. The third word is,  though its use is a little farfetched, "ethnicity" which, when  transliterated, starts with "es" (S) (esnisity). There will be  growing interest in the racial or community issue and in the  so-called "nation state" question--to put it simply, the  question of the nation.    First, as to the South-North issue, I think that this issue  can also be subdivided into three "E's." They are "economy,"  "energy," and "environment." Harmonizing these three "E's"  seems to be synonymous with resolving the issue of the "south,"  that is, developing countries, is it not? On the global  environment problem as well, the following questions are raised:  Which regions will succeed in development? Will they be advanced  countries or developing countries? Another question is: Who will  use fossil fuel? These are the questions which the South-North  issue involves.    I may receive your scolding by saying this, but I think that  it is proper to use atomic power, to which safety is important,  as long as its users are advanced countries.    As to the second "S" or speed, this aspect can also be  divided into two "N's." They are "network" and "neighbors."  These days we frequently hear people talk about downsizing and  in this connection, as the use of networks expands, the need  for, say, libraries will dwindle. It also becomes possible to  obtain copies directly from the U.S. Harvard University library.    Referring to neighbors, it is frequently said that borders  may disappear in the economy-related sector for example. There  were no economic interchanges on the Sea of Japan in the era of  the East-West cold war, but exchanges will be carried out  vigorously through the Sea of Japan in the future.  <H5>  Harmony Between Nation and Individuals </H5>   As to the third category "ethnicity," it can further be  divided into three "H's." The first is "human rights" or  individual rights. Perhaps, the world will change in such a way  that each individual will become its center. The second is  "history." The nation states were formed in modern times, and it  was after the start of the 20th century that the nation states  bent their minds on economic issues and began to mention the  importance of full employment. A nation takes care of its people  by providing conveniences; however, it is not the nation that  furnishes them with affluence. Instead, each individual of the  nation must pursue affluence on his or her own. The most typical  example of this pursuit is a racial movement. Herein lies the  reason for the independence of Czechs and Slovaks in  Czechoslovakia.    Racial problems are rare in Japan, and on this score I think  that they are rather linked to the doctrine of well-being,  thereby becoming arguments for the decentralization of  administrative power.    Concerning the third point, "harmony," I think that how to  harmonize relations among the state, the community, and each  individual will assume importance from now. Such are the  fundamental tides of the world, and I believe that amid them we  are now at a period of adjustment.    I say that the year 1990 marked the end of World War III.  That was the year when the cold war ended. The settlement of  issues ensuing from the termination of this war will require  very large energies, but when I consider the global distribution  of economic influences in the future, I believe that the future  will still be the tripolar era formed by Japan, the United  States, and the EC nations. Perhaps, regional relations among  countries surrounding these tripolar forces will increasingly be  deepened. World War III has ended, and so there will probably no  need for the present veto-bound Security Council which we began  to have when World War II ended. It will be necessary to fully  review the UN organization itself.  <H5>  So Good That They Would Like To Live in... </H5>   The foregoing is an outline of the world direction, but  under  these circumstance what will become of Japan? I would like to  view this question also from three points.    First, we should build a beautiful national land. I think  that Japan's future will largely depend on whether we can build  a national land which is so good that even foreigners would like  to come and live in Japan. When I visit Europe and see such  scenes as red roofs, white walls, and potted flowers hanging in  each house, I feel like living there--though not for life--at  least two or three years. The estimation of a region or a  national land will be decided by whether visitors from around  the world feel like residing there, will it not?    Second, what about becoming a "middle power" in the sense of  restraining ourselves? Of late, our country is frequently called  an economic superpower, but Japan does not need to become a  "superpower" at all. I believe that it will be good enough for  Japan to be a middle power. I think that the recent change of  regime has provided a chance to animate discussions about the  state. From a long-term viewpoint, the form of state we choose  will be a great issue. However, Japan will ruin itself if it  loses its status as a technology-based nation. And future  thriving businesses in Japan will be interface industries which  connect different sectors, will they not? Materials are  connected by distribution, and funds by banking. What connects  techniques is research.    Last, I think that the decentralization of administrative  power is necessary for building a beautiful national land as  well. I propose that local areas be given more authority in the  utilization of land.    What about repealing the Agricultural Promotion Act and the  Town Planning and Zoning Act and enforcing a space maintenance  law like one in Germany? This law provides for a formula under  which the assembly of each local public body designs programs  for the utilization of land while the head of each local public  body enforces them. This formula, when followed, makes it  possible to create a town of red-roofed houses if its members  all say they like the red roof.    Moreover, we will have an aging society from now. It is each  locality that sustains such a society in a real sense. This has  thus far been the job of the nation and the family in terms of  social security. However, support by the family has now reached  its limit. A helping hand is needed in every resperct, but such  a thing is the job of each locality rather than of the nation.  In this sense as well, the decentralization of administrative  power has become important.</p>

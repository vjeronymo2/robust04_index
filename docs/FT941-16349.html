			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Southwark calls in private sector to help rebuild estates Private-sector developers are involved in radical plans for a public/private-sector consortium to tackle one of London's most serious concentrations of poor-quality council housing. Under the proposals being discussed by Southwark council and the Department of the Environment, about 1,000 homes in the five south London estates of North Peckham, Gloucester Grove, Willowbrook, Camden and Sumner could be demolished. The land would be used to build houses for sale and to rent through housing associations, with the remaining council homes refurbished. The comprehensive regeneration project - which involves one of the highest-density population concentrations in the south-east - would be financed by capital from the private sector, the Housing Corporation, the government and the local authority. Costs are still being worked out, but would be considerable. Proposals in 1990 for refurbishment of Gloucester Grove and North Peckham through a Housing Action Trust - which would have taken the estates out of Labour-controlled Southwark council's control - would have cost about Pounds 112m at 1988 prices. The plan was rejected by tenants. Southwark council and the government are investing Pounds 52m in improvements at three of the estates, and the council estimates that work at North Peckham alone will need a further Pounds 48m. An environment department conference on estate regeneration and the private sector on Friday will be told that Southwark has successfully interested private-sector developers - including Barrett and John Laing - in the possibility of joining a consortium to change the social and economic nature of the area. An average of 87 per cent of families are council tenants - rising to 99 per cent on some estates - and it is planned to reduce this to 60 per cent by the end of the decade. The urgent need for a more broadly balanced population on the estates, where unemployment rates are about 27 per cent, is emphasised in a Southwark report on the future of the retail centre at Peckham. 'New housing for sale is vital if Peckham is to stand any chance of retaining its role as a centre even within the borough,' it says. Population density would be cut from 438 per hectare to 350 through substantial demolition of blocks. New homes would be built for sale or rent through housing associations. Gloucester Grove and North Peckham estates have presented problems ever since they were built in the 1970s. They have suffered from inadequate design and high levels of deprivation and crime. The estates suffer serious economic and social problems in spite of being within two miles of central London, which should increase their appeal to private developers. The council envisages working with two to four housebuilders and up to six housing associations. Many residents would have to move to enable the development to take place. Mr John Johnson, who chairs Southwark's economic development committee, said: 'A scheme of this scale would work only with tenants' support, and they are understandably suspicious. But I think they are also realistic, and appreciate that there will be few other opportunities for improving the environment.'</p>

			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Ministers face Scots Tories Scottish Tories, chastened by their disastrous showing in last week's regional council elections, will confront party leaders today at their annual conference in Inverness. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, will be the first of seven cabinet ministers to address the conference. and Mr John Major will attempt to rekindle his premiership at the closing rally on Friday. The Scottish Tories will try to identify what changes of policy or presentation to make. The regional council elections, in which they made a net loss of 23 seats and took less than 14 per cent of the vote, shocked them and came as a pleasant surprise to their opponents in the Scottish National, Liberal Democrat and Labour parties. The Tories are uncertain whether they lost support because of government plans to take Scottish water out of local authority control, or whether former supporters were expressing the same discontent with the Major government as their counterparts south of the border. Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, inclined to the latter interpretation, although he also said the party would have to 'readdress the things we do and the way in which we present them'. Today Mr Hurd will wind up the debate on Europe, replying to a motion that 'supports the principle of subsidiarity, rejecting the concept of a federal Europe'. On Thursday Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, will reply to the debate on the economy.</p>

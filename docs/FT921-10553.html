			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Insurers face 25% increasein cost of reinsurance BRITISH insurers are facing increases of at least 25 per cent in their reinsurance costs following negotiations with international reinsurance companies. Five of the country's biggest general insurers - Commercial Union, Sun Alliance, Royal Insurance, Guardian Royal Exchange and General Accident  - are all affected by the rises. Reinsurers, such as Germany's Munich Re, increased rates by up to 400 per cent last year after they bore the brunt of the devastating storms of January 1990. The general insurers had been expecting to avoid further increases this year, but reinsurers, who are themselves facing losses from a string of catastrophes over the past five years, have taken a hard line and forced through price rises and tougher terms. According Mr Allan Nicholls, analyst at James Capel, the stockbroker, the 'market has tightened further for UK companies'. Analysts suggest some companies have not been able to complete their reinsurance programmes and insurers have been forced to carry a greater proportion of risks on their own accounts. The extra costs come as the industry braces itself for record-breaking losses of more than Pounds 1bn in 1991 when its reporting season begins in three weeks. Mortgage indemnity business - which is not generally reinsured - will generate more than half the total loss. Mr Stephen Bird, analyst at Smith New Court, the securities house, expects deterioration in other areas with losses from recession and weather-related claims climbing.

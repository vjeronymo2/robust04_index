			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Talked out and seemingly bored with the issue, the Legislature urged Congress  to enact a constitutional amendment to protect the American flag against  desecration. In contrast to long and emotional debates earlier, a pair of flag  protection petitions addressed to Congress and President Bush was  overwhelmingly whipped out of the Assembly and Senate without debate in less  than two minutes. Congress is considering such an amendment in the wake of a  U.S. Supreme Court decision that held that burning the flag as a form of  political protest is protected by the constitutional right to free speech.  </P></p>

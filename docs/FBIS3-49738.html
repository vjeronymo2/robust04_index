According to Milan Filo, director of the Department of Trade  at the Slovak Ministry of Agriculture, such imports are the  result of the surviving federal structure of agriculture, which  concentrates final food production in the Czech Republic. Among  the main produce still imported by Slovakia are poultry, dairy  and bakery products, margarine, spirits, and tobacco.</p>

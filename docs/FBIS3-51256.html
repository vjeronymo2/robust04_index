			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Javier Arango in Rio Blanco, Tolima Department; </F> from the "TV Today" newscast]    [Text] An operation was executed this week in Rio Blanco,  southern Tolima Department, presumably with the participation of  DEA members. Witnesses say six helicopters landed with troops,  while two small airplanes overflew the zone.    The helicopters landed, one by one, and deposited troops in  the village. Certain residences were later raided. Aircraft  also overflew the area, and helicopters landed in Gaitan, a  poppy and guerrilla forces center located two hours from Rio  Blanco.    [Begin Hernando Cardenas recording] It has been confirmed  that people's money has been seized. It is known that one  person's 10 million pesos were taken. [end recording]    People living in this zone of Tolima Department say the  country's authorities are doing the right thing when they  provide protection, but they wonder: Why was such an impressive  operation launched? Why did the operation include foreign  personnel?    [Begin recording] [Father Ivan Rodriguez] I saw helicopters  flying overhead. It is true, there were some foreigners.    [Jesus Valbuena] The commanders were people who spoke very  little, and they were heard speaking some words in English. [end  recording]    The residents of Rio Blanco are used to many difficult  situations, but they are still perplexed by this operation.</p>

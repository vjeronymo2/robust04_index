			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / International Company News: BHP earnings advance 11% BROKEN Hill Proprietary yesterday reported an after-tax operating profit of ADollars 258.9m (USDollars 189m) for the three months ended August, 1992, almost 11 per cent up on the same quarter last year. Earnings per share for the Australian mining, energy and steel group increased by more than 6 per cent in the quarter to 20.2 cents from 19 cents. BHP plans to pay an unchanged interim dividend of 19.5 cents. The steel operations recorded the best results among the company's divisions, with profits up 8.2 per cent to ADollars 53m. The result was attributed to profits from New Zealand Steel and to a reduction in the cost of steel production. Petroleum operations rose 6 per cent to ADollars 137.2m, thanks mainly to the higher US dollar oil price and the weaker Australian dollar. Production was also higher during the quarter with production starting in two fields: Skua and Kutubu. The minerals division suffered a setback with profits falling 10.5 per cent to ADollars 158.4m. The weaker result was due to lower prices for coal, iron ore and manganese ore. Minerals division sales rose to ADollars 1.1bn from ADollars 1.06bn. Steel division sales rose to ADollars 1.47bn from ADollars 1.4bn.</p>

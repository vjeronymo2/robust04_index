			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / International Company News: Big names at little-known investment house - Alan Friedman catches up with James Baker and colleagues at the Carlyle Group WHEN cabinet-level officials complete their stints in the US government they often find themselves recruited to corporate boards, investment banks and other private-sector entities keen to cash in on their big names and substantial contacts. However Mr James Baker, the former US secretary of state who finished his time in the Bush administration running the White House, has chosen a more low-profile re-entry into the private sector than most of his peers. He is spending some of his time at the family law firm of Baker and Botts, and plans to write a book about his experience in foreign policy. Rather more significantly, however, the 63-year-old Mr Baker recently became one of only seven partners in the Carlyle Group, a little-known and fast-growing Washington-based investment company that likes to call itself a merchant bank. Each of the partners is believed to earn between Dollars 2m and Dollars 3m a year. The unquoted Carlyle Group, named after the famous hotel in New York, was founded only six years ago with initial capital from the Mellon family, which owns 20 per cent of the business. It is not a merchant bank in the UK sense, in that its strategy tends to involve direct investment rather than corporate finance advice for third parties. Although young, Carlyle has already acquired equity holdings in companies with nearly Dollars 5bn of annual revenues, covering activities such as defence, telecommunications, property and services. Among its more recent deals was the purchase of the aircraft division of LTV Aerospace, a business with Dollars 2bn of annual revenues and an important contractor for the B-2 bomber. The deal was controversial in Washington because Carlyle started out as a partner with Thomson-CSF, the French government-owned defence group accused in Congress of having supplied military equipment to Iraq. Opposition to the French taking control of LTV's missiles business resulted in Carlyle changing tactics and joining forces with Northrop and Loral, two US defence contractors. The chairman of Carlyle is Mr Frank Carlucci, the former secretary of defence in the Reagan administration and once a Princeton classmate of Mr Baker's. Another new partner at Carlyle is Mr Richard Darman, who served as head of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in the Bush administration. Yet another executive is Mr Alton Keel, president of a newly-formed international division and a former national security adviser to President Ronald Reagan. Such a politically high-powered team seems odd given the group's financial approach to deal-making. But Carlyle is the only company of its kind in Washington, and connections clearly help. For example, it was Carlyle that advised Prince al-Waleed bin Talal of Saudi Arabia when he made a controversial Dollars 590m investment in Citicorp in 1991. Mr Baker promises he will not represent any foreign governments or seek to lobby the US government. However colleagues at Carlyle are busy seeking business in places such as Saudi Arabia. Mr Baker, who says it feels 'good to be back in the private sector' describes Carlyle as 'an extraordinarily capable collection of individuals who have a very good track record in the business of investing in companies'. Looking relaxed in a blue monogrammed shirt with the initials JAB, he says he does not want to manage anything any more. 'I have run five presidential campaigns. I have run the Treasury. I have run the White House twice, and I have run the State Department. I don't want to manage.' Mr David Rubenstein, a managing partner at Carlyle, says the former Reagan and Bush administration officials in the company are helpful in generating business because 'these are people who clearly have high visibility and an ability to get meetings for us'. Yet even without Mr Baker and his colleagues Mr Rubenstein has been able to attract fresh capital, most notably a Dollars 100m commitment this week from Mr George Soros, the investor who has joined a new buy-out fund called Carlyle Partners. With Mr Soros's contribution included, the fund already has Dollars 250m of its Dollars 500m total committed. A three-man Carlyle team, led by Mr Rubenstein, will be in Europe next week seeking more investment in the fund - which expects to buy into European as well as American companies - from institutions such as S. G. Warburg in London, Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt and Credit Lyonnais in Paris. Mr Rubenstein says he will also be trying to acquire minority shareholdings in state companies being privatised in France, Italy and Germany. He hopes to close shortly a Dollars 20m investment in IABG, a defence electronics testing business owned by the German government and located near Munich. In Italy, he is working with local partners to buy into companies being privatised in the energy sector. Carlyle is clearly an unusual company to find in the middle of Washington. However, its ability to attract big names and fresh capital suggest it could soon become better-known in both Wall Street and European financial centres.</p>

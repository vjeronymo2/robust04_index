			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Arts: More poetic observations - Radio WILFRED Owen is one of my private heroes, but I was surprised at the comprehensive marking of his centenary. On Sunday, Radio 2 gave a fine two-hour biographical feature presented by Dominic Hibberd. It covered his youth - a home with evangelistic leanings, a harmless affair with a choirboy, a nervous breakdown, a job teaching English in France - in 1915 yet, oddly careless of the war. He was sorry for the French troops, but the British were 'only Tommy Atkins', mere soldiers. Yet he enlisted in the Artists Rifles, commissioned, and won an MC on the Somme. Shell-shocked, he was sent to recover in Scotland. From here on he was more intimately observed in Radio 4's Monday play, Not about Heroes by Stephen MacDonald, virtually a duologue between Owen and Siegfried Sassoon, another shell-shock victim (James Telfer and the author). Sassoon coached him into trying something more concerned with reality and his best work came when he went back to the front, where he was killed in action a week before the Armistice. Some of it, together with his letters, will be read by Kenneth Branagh on Radio 3 in the coming week. Detectives are commoner on the BBC than poets, and two more turn up this week. On Wednesday Radio 4 gave the first of four parts of PD James's Cover Her Face. Detective Adam Dalgliesh did not appear in this part, but the Radio Times told us that Robin Ellis, who is to play him, was jolly good in Poldark. I have heard the whole story (dramatised by Neville Teller) on a BBC Radio Collection cassette, available from April 5, and he is good, among a splendid cast. His problem begins with a cheeky servant-girl found dead in a locked room. Thursday's new investigator, in The Blackburn Files on Radio 4, is firmly working-class, a retired Yorkshire pitman. He only investigates who is stealing flowers from an allotment, but Stephen J. Blackburn (Finetime Fontayne) and his assistant Tracey (Judy Flynn) keep it fun. For addicts of detection, the week also gave Detective-Superintendant Thorne on Monday, solving another problem set him by John Penn; Sherlock Holmes on Wednesday in The Solitary Cyclist; and on Friday Dr Keith Simpson, the detecting pathologist, with a strangled hitch-hiker. More serious was Radio 3's Sunday play, The Lovesong of Alfred J. Hitchcock, by David Rudkin. We are in an imaginary film studio, where a human Camera (Michael Fitzgerald) gives the studio instructions. Hitchcock, played with great realism and sensitivity by Richard Griffiths, wants to reproduce the love-scene he visualised as a boy, but he despises his own fat body and associates women with death. Rudkin repeats similar attempts time and again  -the dream is followed by a thoughtful Hitchcock at work with script-writer and Camera. The play lasted 130 minutes, whichI thought too long. Philip Martin directed. Groucho Was My Father (Radio 4, Wednesdays) presents Miriam Marx Allen, Groucho Marx's elder daughter by his first wife. Groucho's letters to her, read by Frank Ferrante in a convincing imitation of his voice, are witty but ordinary. It is fun to hear talk of 'Uncle Harpo' and 'Uncle Zeppo', especially of 'Uncle Chico', who besought Groucho to make another film with him to make him enough money to pay the gangsters threatening his life. There are two more programmes, presented by Tony Staveacre.</p>

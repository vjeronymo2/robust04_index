Gao  Dezhan, secretary of the Tianjin Municipal CPC Committee and  first secretary of the party committee of the garrison; and Yang  Zhihua, commander, and Yang Huichuan, political commissar of the  garrison, attended the session and presented awards to the  advanced units and individuals who were commended.    The session discussed ways to implement the guidelines of  the  recent enlarged meeting of the Central Military Commission and  the enlarged session of the party committee of the Beijing  Military Region, summarized last year's work, and arranged this  year's tasks. Under the leadership of the party committee of the  Beijing Military Region and the Tianjin Municipal CPC Committee,  the Tianjin Garrison paid great attention to the education for  studying the guidelines of the 14th party congress and the  enlarged meeting of the military commission and achieved notable  results in raising the political level of its units in the past  year. It made conscientious efforts to meet the requirement for  taking military training as the focus and thus created a new  situation in military training. It made efforts to improve  party style and maintain honesty in performance of duty and  further strengthened the leading bodies of the party committees  at and above the regimental level. It conducted strict  management and education to maintain a high degree of stability  and unity of its units. It also enhanced the capacity for  logistic support and achieved new development in logistic  technical support and production. The session urged that in the  new year, all the units of the garrison should conscientiously  implement the guidelines of the enlarged meeting of the Central  Military Commission and the enlarged session of the party  committee of the Beijing Military Region; achieve good results  in the study of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping, in the improvement of the ideology and work  styles of leading bodies, in the reform of the military  training, and in the implementation of the "outlines of the  grass-roots building of the Army;" maintain a high degree of  stability and unity; and successfully fulfill all tasks. It  urged the vast number of commanders and soldiers, militiamen,  and armymen in reserve duty of the entire garrison to "attach  importance to study, abide by discipline, stress unity, and  carry out work," raise spirit, pioneer the way forward, and  further open up a new situation in army building and building  the forces in reserve duty.    Gao Dezhan gave an important speech at the session. He said:  The Tianjin Garrison and the units stationed in Tianjin have  actively participated in Tianjin's economic construction and  various public welfare undertakings over the past many years.  They have played an important role in building key projects,  conducting emergency rescue and relief work, and safeguarding  political and social stability and made outstanding  contributions to promoting the two civilizations in Tianjin.  Every achievement of Tianjin in reform, opening up, and the  modernization drive is linked to the great support of the  People's Army and embodies the painstaking labor and wisdom of  the people's own army.    Gao Dezhan pointed out: Using Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory  of building socialism with Chinese characteristics to arm our  minds and guide our action is the basic guarantee for promoting  reform, opening up, and the modernization drive and also for  comprehensively improving the contingents and revolutionizing,  modernizing, and regularizing the Army. All levels should  regard the study of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory as a basic  task and conscientiously fulfill it. We should intensively  study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping, study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's ideas on the army  building of the new period, exert great efforts to improve  leading bodies, and successfully build the Army to make it  "politically qualified, militarily competent, good in work  styles, strict in abiding by discipline, and reliable in  providing logistic support."    Gao Dezhan pointed out: The Tianjin Garrison and the Army  units stationed in Tianjin should set a good example in  consolidating and developing the unity between the Army and the  government and between armymen and civilians, in supporting  local economic construction, in safeguarding social stability,  and in building the spiritual civilization. They should fully  develop their advantages and make new contributions to  accelerating Tianjin's reform, opening up, and economic  development. While improving themselves and conducting training  for war preparedness, they should actively support local key  projects, social welfare projects, farmland water conservancy  projects, and emergency rescue and disaster relief work. They  should actively participate in the comprehensive management of  public security to safeguard the political and social stability  of the municipality. They should continue the activities for  the Army and the civilians to build the socialist spiritual  civilization together to create a good social environment for  accelerating reform, opening up, and economic development. They  should continue the activities to build the districts and  counties exemplary in the double-support work and, through the  concerted efforts of the Army and local authorities, make the  advanced districts still more advanced, make the mediocre  districts catch up with and surpass the advanced districts, and  promote Tianjin's double-support work to a new height.    Speaking on intensifying efforts to improve reserve forces,  Gao Dezhan said: Party committees and governments at all levels  should correctly handle the relationship between economic work  and the work of the militia and reserve forces and make  conscientious efforts to address the specific problems in the  work of the militia and reserve forces. We should embrace the  idea of focusing on economic construction when developing the  militia and persistently use, train, and make strong the Army on  the major battleground of economic construction. We should  conduct study to explore the new ways to improve the reserve  forces in the condition of the socialist market economy and make  efforts to achieve success in the work of the militia and  reserve forces in the new period. With the establishment of the  socialist market economy system, the work of the militia and  reserve forces can only be strengthened and not weakened. We  should improve the organizations of the grass-roots people's  armed forces departments in line with the "regulations on the  militia and reserve forces of enterprises."    Gao Dezhan also urged: Local party committees and  governments at all levels should intensify the work to support  the Army and give preferential treatment to disabled servicemen  and families of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen and  consider it their responsibility to support army building. The  municipal party committee and government should take the lead in  conscientiously studying and addressing the issues on supporting  army building. They should wholeheartedly help local Army units  resolve the difficulties in the duties for war preparedness,  construction for national defense, production and business, and  scientific research. They should comprehensively implement the  various policies on giving special care to disabled servicemen  and families of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen; place  demobilized and retired soldiers, Army cadres transferred to  civilian jobs, and retired cadres in a down- to-earth manner;  earnestly solve the problems in the job and school arrangements  for the accompanying dependents of Army officers; and do a good  job in the special care and medical service to disabled  servicemen and the families of revolutionary martyrs and  servicemen in order to eliminate their misgivings and provide  favorable conditions for strengthening army building.    In conclusion, Gao Dezhan emphasized: Strong unity between  the Army and the government and between armymen and civilians is  a fine tradition of our party and our Army and an important  magic weapon to win success in revolution and construction. We  should develop this tradition still more in the new situation.  Let us unite more closely round the party Central Committee and  the Central Military Commission with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the  core, establish closer ties between the Army and the government  and between armymen and civilians, work hard in unison, follow  the road of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and  win new success with full confidence.</p>

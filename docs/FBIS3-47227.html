I want to assure you that although we continue  to be very positive on the results of the Seattle meeting and  the future of APEC [Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation], we  certainly do not want it to be a way of discouraging others,  particularly European Union from coming here seeking mutual  gains from both sides, quote unquote, Romulo told reporters.    He said that during his meeting with Clarke, he was told  that  many Europeans perceived the Philippines as, quote unquote, too  oriented towards the United States and Japan. Romulo noted that  since the November Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation leaders'  summit in Seattle, Clarke's visit to the Philippines is the  first manifestation of interest in Asia by several officials  from the European Union. During the APEC summit, the European  Union, formerly known as the European Community, had expressed  alarm that it is still isolated from the Asia Pacific  conference. Clarke told Romulo that as a result of the APEC  meeting, it was assumed that the European Union believed that  this might be misunderstood as though they were just giving up  this part of the globe, quote unquote. But contrary to the  common perception, European nations are interested to expand  economic relations with Asia, Clarke said.    Europe needs to do a lot of work to tackle the business.  Clarke was particularly positive in his desire to focus on the  Philippines and also the Asian region because clearly his  presence here for some five days together with some prominent  businessmen is a good sign.</p>

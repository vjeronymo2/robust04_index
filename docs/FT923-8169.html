			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / Building societies face new squeeze BUILDING SOCIETIES have been asked by the Building Societies Commission, the industry watchdog, to consider ways of tightening up their provisions against loan losses. The move is likely to squeeze building society profits further by forcing societies to put more money aside at a time when they are already suffering from the decline in house sales. Mr Harry Walsh, deputy chairman of the Building Societies Commission, has written to the Building Societies Association asking for its views on new guidelines on provisions after consulting its members. This is the second year in succession in which the BSC has tried to introduce new guidelines for loan loss provisions as a result of the deepening troubles of the mortgage market. Before 1990, loan losses were usually so small that the definition of building society provisions was not an issue. Last year societies were forced to put aside a total of Pounds 1.23bn against bad loans, and the figure for the coming year is expected to be higher. About half a dozen societies, including Town &amp; Country and Leamington Spa, have been driven into pre-tax losses and been forced to give up their independence after having to make heavy provisions against bad loans. Last year the commission's guidelines encouraged societies to make specific provisions for losses on residential mortgages for all cases where payments are more than three months in arrears and it is virtually certain that the lender will make a loss. Most societies also make general provisions against likely losses on their mortgage book as a whole. They also 'suspend' interest on loans with a low chance of recovery, thus reducing the value of the interest receivable on their accounts. Methods for doing so vary greatly between societies. The commission says it wants a standard method of recognising the interest due on non-performing loans and the formal adoption of a three months cut-off point for specific provision and of a standard definition of arrears. It also wants societies to consider methods of security valuation. The commission says it is aware that tighter guidelines on provisions may mean reduced profits for some societies. It says societies should see higher provisions not as a sign of weakness but as part of the process of addressing the difficulties of the market and creating a realistic financial base for the future. Societies have been asked to give their views by August 31 to enable the commission to have its new guidelines in place well before the end of the year when most societies prepare their next set of annual results. Alliance &amp; Leicester, the fourth-largest building society, said it was cutting rates for its 3.2m savers by an average 0.3 per cent from Saturday. The move follows similar cuts by Nationwide and Bradford &amp; Bingley and suggests that large societies are determined to stave off any increase in mortgage interest rates as long as possible.</p>

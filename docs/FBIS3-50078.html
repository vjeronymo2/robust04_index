			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Miladin Manojlovic from Beli Manastir] </F>   [Excerpts] As of 1300, 40 percent of the voters in  Slavonija, Baranja, and Western Srem had visited the polling  stations, which can be considered a good response considering  the poor weather conditions in this area.    In the Beli Manastir electoral unit, as of 1300,  approximately 40 percent of the voters have turned out. This  percentage had already been achieved in Vukovar at 1200. The  response will definitely be even greater since the sun is  melting the ice and snow on the paths. The low temperatures and  ice have forced many people to wait until this afternoon to  vote. However, some just could not be dissuaded by the bad  weather to fulfill their civic right and vote for one of the two  presidential candidates in the republic of Serbian Krajina.  [passage omitted]    The polling stations will remain open until 1900. The first  unofficial results as to who has won the second round of  elections, Milan Babic or Milan Martic, will be announced  tomorrow evening after 1900. Vukovar has forwarded us the data  for some other localities in the republic of Serbian Krajina.  In Vojnic, 17 percent voted by noon; Vrgin Most 35 percent;  Drnis 20 percent; Okucani 32 percent, Pakrac 50 percent; and  Petrinja 30 percent.</p>

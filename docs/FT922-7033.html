			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / Drop in US housing starts may lead to interest rate cut THE BIGGEST monthly drop in US housing starts for more than eight years prompted renewed speculation yesterday that the Federal Reserve might soon signal another cut in interest rates. Housing starts fell by 17 per cent in April, a far bigger decline than most analysts had expected. The figures were released by the Commerce Department as governors and regional presidents of the Federal Reserve, the central bank, met in Washington to review monetary policy. On Wall Street, the benchmark long bond closed more than half a point up on the news, on hopes of an interest rate cut, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a record 3,397.99, up 21.96. The drop in starts affected all regions and categories of residential property, including single-family homes, down 11 per cent. Following other warning signals, including a decline in new house sales, the drop seems to indicate a loss of momentum in residential housing, one of the few sectors of the economy to rebound strongly from recession. The consensus is that the economy is growing sluggishly, at an annual rate of 2-3 per cent. However, the setback in housing is likely to fuel doubts about the pace and sustainability of recovery. Car sales - another critical barometer - remain subdued, while unemployment claims are still abnormally high. Wall Street analysts have been predicting an easing of monetary policy. If the Fed acts, the likeliest move is a  1/4 -point cut in the federal funds rate to 3.5 per cent, the floor set by the current level of the discount rate at which the Fed lends to banks. This would trigger a 1/2 -point cut in banks' prime lending rates to 6 per cent. The Fed is under political pressure to ease monetary policy because monetary growth is barely above the lower limit of its 2.5-6.5 per cent target range. However, it may decide that lower rates would only increase fears of higher inflation. Housing starts in April were running at an annual rate of 1.1m, the lowest level since November but 14 per cent higher than last April. Mr Maury Harris, chief economist at New York broker Paine Webber, said starts were likely to rebound in coming months, reflecting a slight fall in mortgage rates since April.

			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOUSE PROSECUTORS URGE SENATE TO CONVICT JUDGE IN BRIBERY CASE  </P> <P> The House urged the Senate on Wednesday to remove U.S. District Judge Alcee L.  Hastings from office, arguing that Hastings betrayed his office by conspiring  to take a bribe from a defendant in his court.  </P> <P> But Hastings, in an impassioned appeal to keep his lifetime position, continued  to maintain his innocence. "I am not guilty of having committed any crime and  that is my defense," Hastings told a crowded Senate chamber to applause from  the visitor's gallery filled with his supporters.  </P> <P> Hastings is facing removal from office on 17 articles of impeachment passed by  the House 413 to 3 in August, 1988. The articles accuse the 53-year-old judge  of engaging in the bribery conspiracy and then lying about it and manufacturing  evidence at his trial.  </P> <P> Hastings was acquitted of the charges in a 1983 criminal trial, but his alleged  bagman, disbarred Washington lawyer William A. Borders Jr., was convicted of  the same crimes at a separate trial. A panel of federal judges, following their  own three-year investigation, concluded that Hastings was guilty of the crimes  and recommended impeachment.  </P> <P> If convicted by the Senate and removed from office, Hastings would be only the  sixth federal judge to lose his lifetime job and the only one removed from  office on the same charges he was acquitted of at a jury trial.  </P> <P> Addressing the issue of whether impeachment proceedings following acquittal  would constitute a form of double jeopardy, Rep. John Bryant (D-Tex.), the lead  House prosecutor, said:  </P> <P> "What if a federal judge participates in a conspiracy to obtain a bribe, but by  the use of false testimony and fabricated evidence is able to obtain an  acquittal? What if all the facts indicate the judge's guilt? Are we in that  unusual circumstance to look away . . . and allow the judge to continue to  serve? Certainly the answer for us and for you must be no."  </P> <P> Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.) said he was "saddened to come before you today  to urge the removal of one of the handful of black judges who presently occupy  the federal bench." But, he said, "We did not wage the civil rights struggle in  order to substitute one form of judicial corruption for another."  </P> <P> Hastings "has betrayed his office and is no longer fit to wield the power and  authority that has been bestowed upon him," Conyers said. "There have been a  lot of cases in our judicial system in which race has been involved. This is  not one of those or I would be the first to tell you so."  </P></p>

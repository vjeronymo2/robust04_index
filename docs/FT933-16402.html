			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Markets: Why fans love the Bundesbank's game - London THE Germans have been entertaining us this week. Wednesday's Wimbledon quarter-final between Boris Becker and Michael Stich was exciting. But more thrilling was the Bundesbank's ace on Thursday when it cut interest rates by as much as anyone had hoped. While this was more appreciated elsewhere in Europe - other Europeans cut their interest rates, the UK did not - it was regarded generally as positive for the London markets. That might sound odd, since the Footsie ended the week lower after attempting to break the 2,900 level in the first half. But dropping a few points does not mean losing the match. A German rate cut makes a UK reduction more possible, if not as yet likely. However, while the Germans were providing enjoyment, the Americans were dashing British hopes as fears grew that the US economic recovery is weakening. A few US statistics, such as housing starts and employment numbers, suggested that the authorities there should consider cutting, rather than increasing, interest rates. A stalled US economy would not be at all helpful to the UK since about a quarter of the Footsie's earnings come from north America. And Pete Sampras's straight-sets victory over Becker as the week drew to a close does not augur well if you take it as a metaphor for a weak US economy overpowering the German rate cut. Still, there has been a fair bit of good news for the UK equity market this week, notably what has been happening to gilts. A few weeks ago, there was good reason to worry about them. The public sector deficit, projected at up to Pounds 50bn, meant that new stock was bound to be coming at the market at a high rate. It had looked as though the market could be overwhelmed. In the past three months, though, about Pounds 20bn of gilts have been sold, putting the funding programme well ahead of schedule. This week saw a Pounds 3.25bn auction of gilt stock - the biggest ever attempted  - followed within hours by another Pounds 800m of new stock. The auction was a crucial test of sentiment and, at first, it looked as though the market had been out-played. There were barely enough bids to cover the amount of stock on sale, and the difference between the average bid price and the lowest accepted price was wide by the usual standard. However, the market did recover its poise to receive another slug of stock by the afternoon. Dealers said the market-makers, who usually go short of stock ahead of an auction, had not done so this time. Gilts are being supported by buying from foreign investors. As well as relatively high yields available on UK bonds they have also been gaining on the currency as the pound has risen, particularly compared to the D-mark. If that strength looks set to continue - and the pound gained almost five pfennigs over the week - foreign buyers should still be attracted into sterling. A rising gilt market gives support to the equity market, too. Yet, by the end of the week, equities were feeling decidedly anti-climactic about the German rate cut. And if the gilt market has passed the test of its ability to cope with calls on its liquidity, the equity market is nearing its big match, with some of the terms of the BT3 sale having been announced this week. A 10p discount is being given to retail investors - enough to pay for a local telephone call. Retail demand for equities has been high this year, with unit and investment trusts seeing good inflows and new issues being well-subscribed. This week even saw the return of the ballot as a method of allocating shares, when Field Group's offer for sale was 7.4 times subscribed. There has been plenty of positive corporate news, too. On Monday, Heron  - Gerald Ronson's property group, which was the corporate equivalent of two sets and a service break down - appeared to have fought back when its creditors approved re-financing proposals. The week also saw results from Brent Walker, Ascot Holdings (formerly Control Securities) and Ratners, soon to be re-named Signet, each survivors of a similar exercise to Heron's. None is anywhere near fit again - all three making sizeable losses - but each can at least hope for a return to health. Asda, the food retailer which has recovered from set point down, whipped up a Pounds 142.1m profit for its latest financial year. Then, its chief executive, Archie Norman, rather spoilt the celebrations by saying that the future for the big grocers was bleak. Hanson was back on the bid trail when it lobbed in an agreed bid worth a total of Dollars 3.2bn to buy Quantum Chemical Corporation of the US - a move reminiscent of the good old days. Hanson is gambling on an up-turn in the polyethylene cycle, a plastic used for packaging. If it is right, it will have regained its old form of buying assets cheap and played a winner. The end of the week saw Rentokil power an apparently unplayable smash with an increased bid for Securiguard and the purchase of nearly 30 per cent of its target's equity in the market. As City folk were going home at the end of the week, the police were beginning to set up road blocks around the Square Mile. The story put about is that the security cordon is to keep terrorists and their bombs away from the UK's financial centre. But the truth might be simpler. It is not terrorists but aggrieved Lloyd's Names heading for Monday's egm that they are trying to deter.</p>

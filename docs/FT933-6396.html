			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / International Company News: Renault issues warning after profits plunge RENAULT, the state-controlled French car group, yesterday announced a fall of almost 90 per cent in first-half pre-tax profits and said that it saw no sign of an improvement in the depressed European vehicles industry. The company said that pre-tax profits for the first six months of 1993 were FFr730m (Dollars 123.93m) compared with FFr5.44bn in the same period last year. Sales fell by about 8.4 per cent to FFr87.11bn. Car analysts said that Renault's results were slightly better than expected. 'They represent a good performance in the context of the European market,' said Mr Christopher Moore, car industry analyst at Morgan Stanley. Renault said that its shareholdings in the Swedish car group Volvo had reduced its profits by about FFr277m in the first half. But only FFr39m of this negative contribution came in the second quarter and the first half figure as a whole was an improvement over the same period in 1992. In the cars division, which represented about 83 per cent of the group's commercial and industrial turnover, sales fell from FFr79.7bn to FFr72.1bn in the first half. The figures were buoyed by the successful introduction of the Twingo small car, but the particularly steep decline in car sales in southern Europe, where Renault has a large presence, meant that the company's overall share of the European car market slipped from 10.4 per cent to 10.3 per cent. In the industrial vehicles division, including buses and trucks, Renault increased its share of the European market from 9.2 per cent in the first half of last year to 9.5 per cent this year. Sales in the division were fairly stable at FFr12.63bn. Renault said that the company planned to reduce production to respond to the continued weakness of demand in the car and industrial vehicles market. The company added that it would also intensify its efforts to reduce costs and financial charges and increase productivity. But it added that sales and profits 'would suffer, despite these efforts, from the strongly negative impact of the economic environment'.</p>

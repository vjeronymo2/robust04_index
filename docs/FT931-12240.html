			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Money Markets: French cash rates rise INTEREST rates in the French franc cash market firmed sharply yesterday morning as tensions in the European exchange rate mechanism triggered a sudden burst of pressure on the French currency, writes James Blitz. Until yesterday, there had been a strong feeling in the market that the Bank of France would use the renewed calm in the ERM to lower its official interest rates. However, as the franc fell to FFr3.3950 against the D-Mark, dealers wondered whether the Bank might have to push its overnight lending rate above 12 per cent at its regular Thursday intervention. In fact, the Bank left its rates unchanged. But three-month cash was quoted at between 12 3/4 and 13 1/4 per cent, its highest since the currency crisis of last September. There was also another steep fall in the March French franc futures contract as dealers reined in predictions of a sharp easing in German - and hence French - monetary policy before the spring. The March contract dropped 40 basis points to 88.60, but later picked up to 88.68. A dealer said the fall might have been greater had protesting car workers not invaded the Paris Bourse, bringing an early close to trading in the Matif. The market is now pricing three-month French franc interest rates in mid-March at 11.32 per cent, a remarkably high level given yesterday's figure for consumer price inflation to December of 2.0 per cent. One interesting feature of yesterday's trading was how the March Euromark contract rose 8 basis points, closing at 92.01, as the French franc futures came down. Traders seemed to be saying that the more pressure there is on the franc, the more likely it is that the Bundesbank will ease policy. The 15 basis-point cut in the Bundesbank's repo rate earlier this month still convinces the market that the Bundesbank will do its utmost to avoid a devaluation of the franc or suspension of the ERM. In the sterling market, cash rates eased slightly as a large shortage of Pounds 1.8bn was easily removed by the market. The interbank market may not have taken on board the need to push rates down to levels compatible with 6 per cent base rate. Three-month money declined by  1/32 percentage point to 6 1/4 per cent. The one-year rate slipped  1/16 to 6 per cent exactly.</p>

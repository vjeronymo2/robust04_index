			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Mar 18, BNS -- The Russian embassy in  Tallinn says it is unnecessary to publicly respond to anonymous  charges of spying moved against Anatoliy Chizhikov, a counsellor  at the embassy.    "We do not consider it necessary to publicly respond to such  provocative actions by anonymous authors. But speaking about  the Russian diplomat concerned, he received the agreement from  the Estonian government for being accredited in the Republic of  Estonia in his capacity as military, air force and naval attache  with the Russian embassy in Tallinn," said Andrey Yakushev,  press attache at the embassy.    Estonia's Eesti Aeg weekly newspaper in its Wednesday's [16  March] edition published an unsigned paper saying that Anatoliy  Chizhikov is the "chief Russian spy in Estonia." Anonymous  authors of the note claim the diplomat "coordinates the activity  of the Russian spying center operating in Estonia," as well as  of a "special intelligence group" which includes employees from  the Estonian Defense Ministry, the Central Staff, the Interior  and Foreign ministries, as well as other government departments.</p>

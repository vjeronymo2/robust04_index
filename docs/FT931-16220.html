			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Report spells out passive smoking risks ABOUT 3,000 US non-smokers die from lung cancer caused by exposure to tobacco fumes each year. 'Second-hand' smoking produces 150,000-300,000 cases of bronchitis or pneumonia in children under 18 months each year. Up to 15,000 of those infants end up in hospital. These are the conclusions of a long-awaited report on 'environmental tobacco smoke' (ETS), published yesterday by the Environmental Protection Agency, the US federal agency responsible for air and water quality. It is an incendiary document, guaranteed to fuel arguments about smoking's social dangers, and to raise the possibility of tighter smoking restrictions. The study has been a long time in the making. A draft version, suggesting tobacco smoke was a serious carcinogen, was published in June 1990, and drew a fierce response from the tobacco industry. In 1991, an EPA science advisory board sent the report back for better justification of its conclusions . A second review last summer endorsed the risk assessment. The conclusions are on both analysis of ETS and its human 'uptake'; on a review of some 30 statistical studies which have examined the relationship between lung cancer and exposure to secondhand smoke in people who never smoked; and on about 100 studies which looked at the respiratory impact of ETS on children. Aside from the headline conclusions - that ETS is a human lung carcinogen, responsible for several thousand deaths a year - the EPA has also decided that exposure to ETS increases the risk of asthma for 'normal' children, and the severity of symptoms in children prone to asthma. All this has prompted a sharp counter-attack by the tobacco companies. Philip Morris called a press conference at which it reiterated claims that the EPA had not looked at all available studies, and had tweaked some of the normal statistical yardsticks. 'It's an example of adjusting science to fit policy,' said Thomas Borelli, director of scientific affairs. While statisticians and lobbyists battle over the study's merits, a more basic question centres on the practical impact of the EPA's conclusions. Already, rising public awareness of the health risk attached to smoking has caused steady decline in US cigarette sales. The annual fall in unit sales has been running at approximately 2-3 per cent, while the percentage of the adult population which smokes has declined from over 40 per cent in 1965, to around 25 per cent. But US anti-smoking activists have not had everything their way. In the law courts, 'smokers' suits' - attempting to place liability for lung cancer deaths among smokers at the cigarette companies' doors - have conspicuously failed. By contrast, the effort to curtail smoking in public areas and the workplace has been increasingly successful. Today, 46 states and the District of Columbia have laws restricting smoking in some public places. Since the late 1980s, a handful of municipalities have also passed ordinances requiring restaurants and/or workplaces be 100 per cent smoke-free. In 1990, Congress banned smoking on domestic flights. In the same year, New York City outlawed cigarette vending machines, except in bars. But the key issue now is whether the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, part of the Labour Department and responsible for workplace safety and worker health, feels moved to act on the EPA conclusions. To date, apart from obvious guidelines on smoking where combustible materials are present, it has been silent on the ETS issue. In September 1991, however, the agency began its own examination of air quality in the workplace, and a public comment period closed last year. The EPA conclusions, it says, will be studied.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- US: CIGARETTE SMOKERS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Percentage by education group  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        1970    74    76    77    80    86    87    88  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Less than high school  34.8  36.5  35.8  35.8  35.5  35.7  33.9  34.0 High school graduate   38.3  37.6  37.8  38.4  35.7  34.2  32.9  32.0 Some college           36.7  36.9  36.4  35.2  31.2  28.1  25.8  25.4 College graduate       28.1  28.3  27.4  31.2  24.6  18.4  16.1  15.9  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: UHIS and US Centre for Disease Control, Office of Smoking and Health  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

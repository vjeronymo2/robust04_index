			<p><P> January 14, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ARTS CENTER SHOULD BOOK NEW TALENT  </P> <P> The late Andy Kaufman's tribute/parody should have buried the others-as-Elvis  shtick forever, so the Orange County Performing Arts Center's (coming) "Elvis:  A Musical Celebration," featuring three actor versions of the King, is an  unnecessary and puzzling presentation.  </P> <P> By digging up the bloated corpse of Elvis while ignoring the vital  contributions of living contemporary musicians, the "Arts Center" reveals  itself to be nothing but cold concrete anchored in mud.  </P> <P> Only an inventive, diverse booking policy recognizing fine talents such as  Celia Cruz, John Lee Hooker, Public Enemy, Yellowman, 3 Mustaphas 3, Eddie  Palmieri, Kassav, B-H Surfers, Dwight Yoakam, Black Stalin, Flaco Jimenez,  Jane's Addiction, Alpha Blondie, Pancho Sanchez, and Beausoleil -- to name a  few -- will bring much-needed credibility (and patrons) to the Center.  </P> <P> DARYL FLOOD  </P> <P> Orange  </P></p>

Surprisingly, the meeting was held behind closed doors at a  Febrerista Revolutionary Party office, after the meeting that  should have been held at the Vice Presidency last week was  canceled without explanation. Dr. Seifart said that the foreign  minister had reminded Seifart that as vice president of the  Republic, he could not receive the DPRK politician at the Vice  Presidency because Paraguay does not have diplomatic relations  with the DPRK.    It has been rumored, however, that the U.S. and ROK  Embassies  had strongly opposed the meeting.    "We want to be consistent with regard to our international  policies. Until these two countries solve their unification  problem we cannot risk harming the relations we have already  established," Seifart explained. He thus tried to justify the  position of the president of the Republic, who from the  beginning said that his administration would not establish  diplomatic relations "with any Communist country."    Seifart pointed out, however, that despite not having  diplomatic relations with the DPRK, the government would not  oppose having trade relations with that country.</p>

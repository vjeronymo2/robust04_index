			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Directors' transactions The largest sale of the week took place at Irish property company Ewart where Frank Tughan sold more than 2.7m shares at 70p and then resigned. The stock was bought by Fortress Hill, a company owned by Brian O'Connor, chairman and chief executive of Allied Group. Keith Edwards, previously managing director of the wholesale division of ISA International, is another director to have resigned from his job and to sell the majority of his holding at the same time. Shares at Wilshaw, the diversified engineering and building products firm, have been performing well over the past year, recording a relative outperformance of 68 per cent. The sale by Trevor Brentnall, a non-executive director, at 55.5p leaves him with 340,000. Lookers. Last week, we noted that directors had been exercising options and selling the resulting holdings. In fact, directors have been net buyers of the stock.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------   DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                                                            No of Company               Sector      Shares     Value     directors  --------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Chiltern Radio         Mdia       50,000   117,500         1 Drayton Far East       InvT      550,000   742,500         1 Etam                   RetG        6,666    17,198         1 Ewart                  Prop    2,725,647 1,907,953         1** Faupel Trading         Text       30,000    22,200         1 ISA International      Dist       32,000    37,120         1 IoM Stm                Tran       17,000    22,100         1 Stanley Leisure        L&amp;HI       25,000    83,250         1 Wilshaw                Dist      100,000    56,000         1 Land Securities        Prop       50,000   215,000         1*  --------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Allied Colloids        Chem       15,000    18,750         8 BOC                    Chem        3,500    24,195         2 Beazer Homes           BCon       12,587    16,197         3 Brixton Estate         Prop       29,202    55,192         4 Coutts Consulting      SSer       20,000    10,000         1 David Lloyd            L&amp;Hl       50,000   120,000         1 Hawtin                 DivI    1,809,250   343,757         2 Hawtin                 DivI       75,000    16,500         1 Hi-Tec Sports          L&amp;Hl       25,000    12,000         1 Inchcape               Dist       15,000    63,750         2 Inspirations           L&amp;Hl      100,000   120,000         1 Marks &amp; Spencer        RetG        5,000    20,050         1 Nth Ireland Elec       Elec        6,510    24,998         1 Sears                  RetG       20,000    21,100         2 Stakis                 L&amp;Hl       20,000    16,800         1 Storm Group            Mdia      175,000    24,500         1 TI Group                Eng        3,000    10,440         1 Utd Industries          Eng      185,000    29,600         1 Value &amp; Income Tst     InvT       20,000    23,200         1*** Vardon                 L&amp;Hl       30,000    34,800         1 Wessex Water            Wtr        4,500    27,225         1  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / International Company News: Sales rise at Harley-Davidson HARLEY-DAVIDSON, which reported higher 1992 first-quarter results, said worldwide demand for its motorcycles continued to outweigh supply, Reuter reports. The US motorcycle maker reported 1992 first-quarter earnings rose to Dollars 8.7m from Dollars 4.5m last time which lifted per share earnings to 48 cents a share from 25 cents last year, reflecting the impact of a two-week strike in the 1991 first quarter. The advance was achieved on sales which rose to Dollars 247.4m from Dollars 196.2m in the 1991 first quarter. The company said first-quarter motorcycle shipments were hurt by shipment of about 3,000 units in the 1991 fourth quarter, which normally would have been held in inventory until the first quarter. It added that 3,000 motorcycles from year-end stocks were shipped in December in response to dealer demand. The company said its Holiday Rambler's Recreational Vehicle unit lifted sales 37 per cent to Dollars 47.5m in the quarter.</p>

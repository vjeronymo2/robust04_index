			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Ministry Director General </F> Uri Savir by Mikha Friedman and Ya'el Dan, on 22 June; place not  given -- recorded]    [Text] [Friedman] In view of our close acquaintance with  King Husayn, and the general view that for every step forward he  makes, he immediately makes two steps back, would you suggest  that Yitzhaq Rabin have a new suit made up for a meeting with  Husayn in October?    [Savir] This government and its prime minister had their  peace suits made up a long time ago. I disagree with you and  think that what we see in almost all the tracks is two steps  forward and one step back. There are those who are too  influenced by the steps back. I think there has been a  development in the Jordanian position, and it should be welcomed.    [Friedman] Nevertheless, Israeli journalists were not  allowed into the monarch's Washington news conference yesterday.  That is not something indicating an imminent breakthrough in  relations between the two states.    [Savir] That is precisely the step backward. I watched the  news conference where the king referred to anticipated meetings  at a high level and Jordan's independence. I think that despite  all the caution, we should see it as a positive development.  What is interesting is that each time we see progress in a  certain track -- this time it was again in the Palestinian  track, that is implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement --  we later see progress in the other tracks. If previously in the  peace process the lowest common denominator pulled everything  down, now the highest common denominator pulls everybody  forward. The train has left the station, and King Husayn does  not want to miss it.    [Dan] Do you not see any impact from the Jordanian track on  the negotiations with Syria? Do you believe the Syrian  president is really being indulgent?    [Savir] I would not count on it. I think Husayn looks in  the Palestinian direction and observes the fact that an economic  agreement has been signed. The moves should be seen against the  background of the economies in the region. I think that due to  the Israeli-Palestinian economic accord, there is a Jordanian  desire to join the various agreements, in order to make sure it  is not being left out. The monarch apparently feels that  al-Asad is progressing and is not necessarily asking for his  opinion. 'Arafat also acted that way. If the king waits for  others all the time, he will come out the loser on all sides.    [Friedman] We discussed Syria, and yesterday we read that  Israel's Foreign Ministry has finally been brought into the  negotiations with Syria after being exclusively the hands of the  prime minister for months.    [Savir] That is incorrect because the foreign minister and  his ministry were full partners to that issue as well, and I do  not think there has been a change because there was no need for  one.    [Dan] Please help us to understand the Ahmad al-Tibi issue.  Why does it crop up now?    [Savir] I think it is coincidental. It cropped up a long  time ago. At the outset when the PLO issue was new, we might  have been mixed up, but the moment the contacts with the PLO  became established, it was clear that Israel cannot conduct  political negotiations via Israeli citizens as receivers of  messages from the Arab side. Nobody has anything personal  against al-Tibi.    [Dan] But he has been a partner to the contacts for a long  time, therefore he says the whole thing is the outcome of a  power struggle between the Prime Minister's Office and the  Foreign Ministry.    [Savir] I regret to disappoint al-Tibi, but the Prime  Minister's Office and the Foreign Ministry worked together  throughout the Oslo talks, not with al-Tibi but with the PLO.  It is true that later on he transferred a number of messages,  and I can to a some extent understand his frustration, but I do  not understand why as an Israeli citizen he takes it so much to  heart. An Israeli citizen, whether Jew or Arab, cannot be an  adviser to Yasir 'Arafat, but nobody plans to boycott him.  Political contacts with the PLO are conducted with PLO  officials.    [Friedman] Nevertheless, Yo'el Singer's legal opinion was  issued on 17 October, 1993 -- eight months ago -- and last month  Shim'on Peres met with al-Tibi twice in his office and at his  home.    [Dan] The timing is strange.    [Savir] I do not know what happened last month. It is true  al-Tibi came with certain messages, and I think that due to the  novelty of that track it is possible that it should not have  happened in the past and that is no reason why it should happen  in the future. I think that at present we have a clear partner  on the Palestinian issue and it is also clear to us who is a PLO  official and who is an Israeli.</p>

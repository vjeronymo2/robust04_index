			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Hartstone warning Dealers demolished the Hartstone share price after the company, involved in leathergoods and hosiery, shocked the market by issuing another profits warning, the second in three months. It accompanied the warning with news that it had breached banking covenants in its existing lending agreements and that the chairman and chief executive had relinquished his responsibilities. Hartstone shares, which traded as high as 277p earlier this year, plunged to 32p before closing 57 down at 34p with around the market suggesting that many speculators, gambling on takeover rumours in recent weeks, have been badly burned. Turnover in Hartstone reached a hefty 13m shares. The market's latest newcomer, RPC Group, the packaging company put on a sparkling debut. Against a placing price of 125p, the shares raced up to close at 159p with 16m shares changing hands. This week's switching out of the oil majors, BP and Shell, and into British Gas proved a short-lived affair, with the last-named losing almost all of Thursday's rise and closing 3 1/2 down at 290 1/2 p. One specialist said: 'Contrary to rumours in the traded options market earlier in the week, it was becoming increasingly obvious that the Monopolies Commission will open up the domestic gas sector to independent competition and that this will probably result in severe downward pressure on gas's earnings in the medium term.' BP eased 3 to 307 1/2 p despite stories that the Cusiana oil field in Colombia may be officially declared commercial within a few days. Shell fell 6 1/2 to 605p, with Goldman Sachs, the influential US investment bank, a big seller. The increase in the Lasmo's US bond issue, which dealers said showed the large appetite of the US lending institutions for oil stocks, saw the shares hold at 153p and probably underpinned its membership of the FT-SE 100 Index, at least until the next quarterly meeting of the FT-SE Steering Committee, on June 9. A positive AGM statement from Tesco left the shares 1 1/2 up at 222p in good volume of 5m. The shares have been strong all week on anticipation of better news, which duly showed in yesterday's statement in the form of sales running more than 9 per cent higher than last year. Like-for-like sales, after stripping out the effect of new store openings, were said to be up 1.5 per cent in the first three months of its new financial year. Chairman Sir Ian MacLaurin said: 'There are signs this year that our performance is improving against the opposition.' Hotel group Forte, which announced a 90.5 per cent take-up of its enhanced scrip dividend offer, gained 2 to 194p. Savoy Group climbed 20 to 775p. Forte refused to confirm press rumours that it has appointed a former Savoy executive to its management team. Guinness continued to be the focus of attention in the drinks sector as the group followed up its AGM this week with a series of presentations. The shares have been flat performers in recent months, hemmed in by weak overseas markets, particularly in whisky, and worries over its brands. While some drinks analysts believe the bad news is now in the shares, there is little support for any short-term change in sentiment. Yesterday, the stock slipped 9 to 466p. Shares in Mosaic Investments, suspended last September at 60p, were relisted following approval from shareholders for its re-organisation proposals. However, dealers remain cautious and the shares promptly dived 41 to close at 19p. Further weakness in English China Clays raised fears that the stock may lose its FT-SE 100 status. The shares gave up another 8 to 414p. McKechnie added 8 to 418p with BZW said to have been recommending the stock. The list of stocks trading against the market trend included Lex Service, where the shares jumped 11 to 341p, after Smith New Court upgraded profit expectations and turned a buyer of the stock. Smith increased the current year forecast by Pounds 1.6m to Pounds 37.5m and the following year's figure by Pounds 2.1m, saying: 'Lex's change of policy to increase the sale of used cars is going to result in improved margins.' Suggestions that the weakness in GKN's German market, one of its most lucrative, may after all not be as bad as had been feared, together with a trading squeeze, saw the company's shares put on 9 to 457p. Whispers of an impending order saw British Aerospace move 10 ahead to 339p, in trade of 1.8m. Sentiment was further assisted by a Paribas recommendation. Other statistics, Page 11.</p>

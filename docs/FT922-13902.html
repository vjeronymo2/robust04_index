			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: Czech tobacco group draws bids - Western companies are vying to buy Tabak The future ownership of Tabak, the Czech tobacco company, is to be decided shortly after the close tomorrow of a tender which has stirred the controversy about the sale of former communist monopolies to western companies. Bidders - which include Philip Morris, RJR Reynolds, BAT Industries, Seita and Rothmans International - have been asked to present offers to acquire an initial 30 per cent of the company. This stake is expected to grow into a majority ownership over time. The investment will provide a strategic stronghold in the Czechoslovak tobacco industry and in eastern Europe. Tabak produces 20bn cigarettes annually and dominates the tobacco industry in Czechoslovakia, which it shares with a smaller Slovak company. The company's production volume also exceeds that of the Hungarian plants which were recently sold to foreign companies. Multinational tobacco companies have been running a cut-throat race to win positions in the eastern European cigarette markets. The rising demand for western brands in these countries provides scope for greater growth than in western countries where sales are likely to decline. The strategic value of the Czechoslovak tobacco company has been lifted by the recent decision of the government to keep the company as a whole rather than sell it in parts to competing buyers. This move differs from Hungary, where Philip Morris has invested in the largest tobacco company and will be competing with BAT, which recently bought a plant producing 40 per cent of the 26bn cigarettes consumed annually in the country. In Poland, a government decision on the fate of the various tobacco plants, which already operate independently, is needed before sales can proceed. The Czech company, whose 1991 sales amounted to Kcs4bn (Dollars 133m), controls an estimated 70 per cent of the tobacco market in the Czech republic. On the national level, it is believed to control 60 per cent of the Czechoslovak market, which it shares with the Slovak tobacco company, CSTP. Tobacco companies have complained that the sale of Tabak will give a quasi-monopoly situation to the final buyer and prevent competition among plants. They claim that selling separate plants would maximise the level of investment in each plant, provide guarantees for employment levels and foster overall growth. The maintenance of a quasi-monopoly could lead to high prices and reduced output, which in turn would affect tax revenues. Tobacco companies are still taxed on a turnover basis in Czechoslovakia although a VAT tax is planned for the near future. Arguing against a break-up of Tabak, Czech officials have pointed out that Tabak's position is not fully monopolistic because it shares the national market with CSTP, the Slovak tobacco company and because imports of cigarettes are liberalised. Legal cigarette imports accounted for 4 per cent of the overall 31bn of cigarettes consumed in Czechoslovakia in 1990. CSTP produces an average of 12bn cigarettes a year. It is also up for sale with Austria Tabak believed to be a front runner. A clause in the purchasing contract of Tabak stipulates that the two companies have to be sold to separate international. Government officials have argued that the five plants of Tabak are inter-dependent and therefore cannot be easily separated. Filters and packages, for example, are all produced in one plant. Large companies in Czechoslovakia, which operated in monopolistic situation in the communist era, have proved difficult to restructure before sale. This has been achieved when production was differentiated, as is the case for Skoda-Pilsen, the large engineering company where separate joint ventures were created. In many cases, the government, which wants to privatise as fast as possible, has opted to sell whole companies. The recent sale to Nestle and BSN of Cokoladovny, the Czech chocolate manufacturer which operates 15 plants and holds 85 per cent of the market for chocolate products in the Czech republic, was criticised locally as preventing the development of smaller separate companies. In general, the Czechoslovak authorities have preferred to ensure local companies a significant western buyer rather than risk lowering interest by offering smaller units. In the case of Tabak, selling the company with its large market share will maximise the investment, say Czech officials. Western companies investing in eastern Europe have often been willing to pay more for significant market shares than for assets, which often need considerable upgrading. To prevent the final buyer from concentrating operations at one Tabak plant, Czech officials say that the purchasing contract will include a period of time during which employment must be maintained and operations cannot be closed down. This provision, which has been common in joint venture agreements signed in Czechoslovakia, could stretch over three to five years, officials say. Such a provision would not prevent the buyer from significantly reducing operations in some plants. Winning control of Tabak would be an important prize for an international group involved in the intense global battle for market shares. With this advantage at stake the government is expecting a high price.</p>

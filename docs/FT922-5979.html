			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Germans fail to agree unification financing GERMANY'S government and opposition yesterday failed to narrow their differences on the crucial question of how to finance German unification, whether by increased taxation or drastic budget cuts. Top-level talks between Chancellor Helmut Kohl, his coalition partners, and the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) left the two sides 'living in two different worlds', according to Mr Bjorn Engholm, the SPD leader. Yet the leading political parties, shaken by a series of election results showing growing public disenchantment with all of them, agreed to co-operate on two key subsidiary issues: reforming property laws to encourage private investment in the former East Germany; and accelerating moves to control the influx of asylum-seekers and refugees. They also agreed to ensure the necessary constitutional changes to ratify the European Community treaty on political and monetary union - while leaving the fine details to negotiations between the central government and the 16 federal states. Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, was adamant he could control the government's budget deficit through rigorous savings, keeping growth in public spending down to an overall 3 per cent, and just 2.5 per cent for central government, until 1995. Mr Engholm countered with a grim warning that an array of costs was being underestimated, including compensation for east German property owners, cleaning up the environment, aiding eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, and paying more money to the EC budget. The SPD proposes a levy on enterprises and the higher-paid to cut the budget deficit, forecast this year at DM42bn.( Pounds 14.2bn) One positive sign was an agreement to legislate to ensure investment in the east was protected from confusion over property claims by former owners.</p>

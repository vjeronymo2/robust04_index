Addressing a provincial economic conference which opened  here  Tuesday [11 January], Wan said that Zhejiang's gross domestic  product (GDP) -- the value of goods and services produced -- is  expected to total 164.5 billion yuan last year, up 25 percent  over 1992.    He also released other figures illustrating Zhejiang's  impressive economic growth in 1993: industrial output value is  projected to shoot up 52.5 percent to 392.8 billion yuan; retail  sales are expected to climb 33 percent to 75.9 billion yuan;  exports are projected to jump nearly 20 percent to 4.44 billion  U.S. dollars; and revenue is expected to soar almost 39 percent  to 16.6 billion yuan.    The governor said that the GDP of Zhejiang, with a  population  of 43 million, has risen at an annual rate of 12 percent since  1980.    Local officials and economists attending the conference  agreed that Zhejiang's rapid economic growth stems primarily  from the expanding a market economy in line with specific  conditions in the province.    Conference delegates will discuss measures to step up the  reforms and accelerate economic growth in the new year, with  emphasis on enhancing the consciousness of opening up and  expanding an open economy.    Governor Wan said higher consciousness of opening to the  outside world makes it imperative to break away from what he  called the idea of a "small-scale peasant economy," and to  effect fundamental changes in the way of thinking and work  styles.    According to Wan, the BOT (build, operate and transfer)  method -- which means that a facility is built and operated by  an overseas company before transferring it to Chinese  authorities after a given period -- should be adopted in using  foreign funds to undertake major infrastructure construction  projects.</p>

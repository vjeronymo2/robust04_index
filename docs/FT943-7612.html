			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / International Company News: IBM gears up for PC price war - The personal computer division is being reshaped The general outlook at International Business Machines is getting brighter, with modest profits forecast for the year. However, clouds are gathering over the company's Dollars 12bn personal computer business. Only marginally profitable, and with virtually flat revenues in a rapidly growing market, the IBM Personal Computer Company has seen its market share fall sharply over the past year. In the US, IBM has lost its market leadership, falling to fourth place behind Compaq Computer, Apple Computer and Packard Bell in terms of unit sales. Adding to IBM's PC woes, Compaq has slashed prices on many of its products by up to 22 per cent, in a move that is expected to prompt a price war throughout the PC industry. IBM PC is also faced with having to bring to market this year a long-promised range of PCs based on 'PowerPC' chips jointly developed with Motorola and Apple Computer. What should have been an opportunity for IBM to pull ahead of the pack in the personal computer market now appears far less promising, at least in the short term. To knock IBM PC into shape, Mr Lou Gerstner, IBM chairman and chief executive, has brought in Mr Rick Thoman, a long-time colleague at American Express and RJR Nabisco. Mr Thoman, who joined IBM in January, is known as a tough manager and an experienced international marketer. In a sweeping reorganisation of the IBM PC business, Mr Thoman has disbanded the self-contained 'brand teams' set up to develop and market IBM's various PC product lines. He has also announced plans to consolidate IBM PC's US operations, bringing most together at four sites, down from over a dozen, with the loss of between 1,500 and 2,000 jobs. 'There is a trilogy of things you have to worry about: cost, quality and speed,' says Mr Thoman. IBM PC is the best in the industry in terms of quality, he claims, 'but we have higher costs and are slower than some of our best competitors. So our objective is to get our costs down to competitive levels and become much faster in terms of reacting to the marketplace and getting new models out on time.' Streamlining the organisation will cut costs, but more importantly it will speed up response times, Mr Thoman says. Although the IBM PC company was regarded just a year ago as a model 'independent business unit', it had in fact become bogged down in bureaucracy, he says. 'To fill a typical corporate order, 13 managers had to sign off on various decisions,' he complains. 'Obviously, that made us slower than our competitors.' Mr Thoman has also laid plans to simplify IBM's 'almost unmanageable' array of products - about 70 models with over 400 different configurations - and to standardise components throughout the product range. This will help to save costs and reduce inventories, he explains. A new worldwide information system is also being installed to help manage supply and demand for products by simplifying inventory transfers. Managers from IBM PC's UK factory have been put in charge of efforts to shift production to a more efficient 'build-to-order' schedule, already implemented at the plant in Greenock, Scotland. As a newcomer to the computer industry, Mr Thoman observes that the IBM PC business is 'like a healthy young child who does some things very well and some things abysmally badly'. He says: 'There is too much focus on technology and very little on what customers want and need.' For IBM, the Power PC microprocessor is a pertinent example of technology versus customer needs. Heavily promoted by IBM, Motorola and Apple over the past three years as a higher-performance alternative to the established PC technology standard, based on Intel-designed microprocessors, PowerPC lacks the software base to make it useful to most PC buyers. Yet IBM is committed to delivering PowerPC personal computers later this year. Mr Thoman does not hide his lack of enthusiasm for the new technology. 'People in the industry and even occasionally within IBM seem to want me to say something different, but I believe that the customer comes first. From an IBM PC point of view, we don't care which technology the customer chooses. If they want PowerPC, we have it. If they want a traditional PC (based on an Intel microprocessor) we have those too. Increasingly, it doesn't bother me.' PowerPC remains, however, a central element of the technology strategy for the whole of IBM. So, while it may not be ready for the IBM PC market, Mr Thoman has little choice but to put machines on the market that already seem doomed to sell poorly. An even more pressing problem for IBM PC is intense price competition. Compaq's latest price cuts are aimed squarely at IBM's traditional stronghold in the corporate sector of the PC market. Now IBM faces the difficult choice between matching Compaq's prices or risking a further decline in market share. How IBM responds to this new challenge will be a test for Mr Thoman and his new management team at IBM PC. The PC industry, he is quickly finding out, is brutally competitive. It is also, however, 'an industry in which companies have a history of making comebacks', he observes. 'To be a true industry leader, you have to demonstrate superiority not over a half year, or even a whole year, but over a period of several years.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] A Libyan in Paris: The rumor went round Paris  this morning and it was correct. The Libyan foreign minister  did visit the capital last weekend. His presence has surprised  and saddened the families of the casualties of the terrible bomb  attack against the UTA DC-10. Philippe Boisserie reports:    [Boisserie] [passage omitted] For [Foreign Minister] Alain  Juppe, there is nothing abnormal about this visit:    [Begin recording] [Juppe] [Words indistinct] not at all  sudden, it has been his 10th or 15th visit over the last three  or four years. I would like things to be clear. What is all  this about? France has an extremely firm position -- perhaps  the most firm position among all Western countries -- concerning  the sanctions against Libya.    [Boisserie] What did he come for then? Do you know?    [Juppe] You will have to ask him, I did not see him. [end  recording]    [Boisserie] The Quai d'Orsay [Foreign Ministry] added that  it  was merely a private stopover on his way back from South Africa,  that there were no official contacts. However, among those  taking part in the trip was someone who is not insignificant and  who is of interest to Judge Bruguieres: The lawyer of the four  Libyans whose extradition to France he has been demanding in  vain. For the families of the casualties, this is too much.  [passage omitted]</p>

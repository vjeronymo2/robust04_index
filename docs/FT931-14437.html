			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Uruguay Round talks await signal THE Trade Negotiations Committee, the most senior negotiating body of the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks, will today formally take stock of the six-year-old talks on the eve of President Bill Clinton's inauguration. Resumption of talks now awaits a signal from the new administration in Washington. Although US and European Community negotiators did not make the necessary breakthrough in their last-minute dash for the line before President George Bush leaves office tomorrow, EC officials said yesterday there was a basis for a Uruguay Round settlement. 'The beginning of March or some weeks beyond that is now a realistic working hypothesis,' a senior EC negotiator said, referring to the March 2 deadline for submission of a Uruguay Round pact to the US Congress under the administration's current negotiating authority. US officials have implied that, if President Clinton requested it, Congress might be prepared to grant the talks an extension, although this could not go beyond the end of May, when the negotiating mandate expires. The Clinton administration would then have to seek a new mandate, which would almost certainly mean changes to the Uruguay Round agenda and another long delay before the 108-nation talks could be completed. EC negotiators have consistently pressed for an early deal but might welcome a short delay until after French elections in March. The French government has threatened to veto the Uruguay Round package, which embodies a farm trade deal it opposes.</p>

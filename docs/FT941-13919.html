			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Offerings for investors tempted by equities - A look at trusts being launched to meet the demand for stocks The strong performance of the UK stock market last year and excitement at the prospect of high levels of growth in the Far East have led to a spate of new offerings from investment houses. With interest rates low, money has been piling into equities. Schroder and Gartmore investment trusts (see right) have both packaged their new UK funds to appeal to the personal equity plan market in the run up to the end of the tax year. Both are UK funds, the first focusing on growth and the second on both income and growth. The other UK fund, Saracen, will invest in smaller companies, while Edinburgh Fund Managers and Martin Currie are looking for growth in the East. Newton's Distributor fund is an international fund aimed at those seeking income. Two of the funds are unit trusts, the rest are investment trusts. For unit trusts, the launch period may be an attractive time to buy since discounts are usually on offer. Martin Currie, for example, will knock one percentage point off the initial charge for new buyers. However, investors moving into an investment trust may be put off buying at the launch, because they pay full price for shares which often start trading at a discount. This is because of the costs of the issue. Many fund management groups try to compensate for this by issuing free warrants with parcels of shares. A warrant gives you the right to buy shares in the trust or company on a future date at a fixed price, often the original offer price. As the warrant is usually exercised in the future, you would normally expect the share price to have moved well above its issue price by then, so the warrant gives you a very attractive buying opportunity. Warrants can be sold separately from the shares, and their price rises as the share price moves upwards. The value of the warrant after a while should be enough to cancel out the discount on the ordinary shares. For example, investors in the the Edinburgh New Tiger trust will receive one warrant for every five shares they buy. These warrants have a 15-year life, and the first exercise date is three or four years away. EFM hopes that the price of the warrants when they start trading could account for about 7p a share, compensating for a possible discount of 4p or so on the actual shares. The Saracen Value Trust and Schroder UK Growth Fund will also be issuing warrants on a one-for-five basis. Split capital trusts aim to get around the same problem of the discount by dividing up the share capital to form parcels that are attractive to investors with particular needs, so that steady demand prevents the shares from falling to a discount. For example, the new Gartmore trust is aiming its ordinary income shares at private investors wanting income, and using a Pep for tax shelter, while the zero dividend shares may appeal more to institutional investors. It may not seem a good time to enter the UK stock market, which performed strongly towards the end of last year but Peter Sedgwick, chief executive of Schroder Investment Management, believes that there is still more to come. He says that the emphasis on income funds has left a gap in the market: 'Now that yields on the UK market have fallen in anticipation of a recovery in profits, the emphasis is switching to growth stocks.' Edinburgh Fund Managers' New Tiger trust combines two of the popular investment areas of the last few months: emerging markets and smaller companies. Although the fund will be invested in Asia, it will avoid the established markets of Hong Kong and Singapore; other markets such as South Korea and Taiwan may soon be excluded as too developed. New Tiger will be looking at the smaller markets, such as Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand, and only using Hong Kong for its exposure to China, Vietnam, Laos etc. South Asia is also on the menu - EFM has just bought a stake in an Indian fund management group, so more investment there can be expected. The launch has been timed for funds to be invested immediately after the Chinese New Year in mid-February, traditionally a quiet time for south-east Asian markets, with a chance of bargains to be had. NEWTON Name. Distributor Fund. Aims. To achieve a total return of income and capital growth from a portfolio of UK and international equities and to allow investors to draw on capital to supplement income. Yield. 3 per cent. Minimum investment. Pounds 6,000 Charges. 6 per cent initial and 1.5 per cent annual. Pepable? Yes, at no extra cost. Minimum Pep investment is Pounds 3,000. Comment. The fund is aimed at income seekers who will be able to withdraw up to 9 per cent annually. The withdrawal levels are 3 per cent, 5 per cent, 7 per cent and 9 per cent. The income can also be left to be reinvested. The fund's aim is to replenish, in real terms, the capital withdrawn under the terms of the plan but, of course, cannot guarantee this. Newton is well-known for its Income fund which currently yields about 3.2 per cent and is top of its sector over seven years and five years, and third over three years (to Jan 1, source: HSW). The minimum investment and charges are relatively high. See Serious Money, page II GARTMORE Name. British Income &amp; Growth Trust. Aims. Investment in UK shares with a higher than average yield. Terms. Ordinary income shares at 100p, zero dividend shares at 116p or packaged units combining the two. Prices may change before offer opens on February 15. Yield. 9.3 per cent on the ordinary shares (in the form of income), 8 per cent on the zeros (in the form of capital growth), and 4.4 per cent on the packaged units. Minimum investment. Pounds 1,000. Charges. Issue expenses capped at 4 per cent; annual management fee 0.5 per cent, except for Peps. Pepable? Yes, for an initial charge of 1 per cent, and annual management charge of 0.75 per cent. Comment. This issue is timed so that investors can transfer shares into a Pep on either side of the tax year-end, using one or both years' allowances. But the yield on the trust is not over-generous: Gartmore's own Shared Equity trust is higher. The fund needs to grow at 5 per cent a year if the income shares are to be repaid with no loss of capital in 2002. SARACEN Name. Saracen Value Trust. Aims. To invest in smaller companies (from the FT-SE SmallCap index), with the aim of achieving long-term capital growth. Yield. Similar to average smaller company yield. Minimum investment. Pounds 1,000 Charges. Issue expenses capped at 3.5 per cent, with a 1 per cent annual management charge. Terms. Ordinary shares at 100p, with one warrant attached to every five shares. Offer opens: February 10. Pepable? Yes, independently. Comment. As Saracen Fund Managers is a new outfit, and this is their first trust, there is no track record to check. But James Fisher, the main manager of this fund, was previously a fund manager at Scottish Amicable, in charge of Pounds 1bn of funds, mostly invested in smaller companies. Smaller companies are a popular investment area at the current stage of the economic cycle. The Hoare Govett Smaller Companies index rose by about 39 per cent last year (more than the FT-SE), and if the recovery gathers pace, there should be more growth to come. SCHRODER Name. UK Growth Aims. To achieve high capital growth through investing in UK equities. Yield. In line with the FT-A All-Share. Minimum investment. Pounds 1,000 Charges. The annual management charge will be 0.75 per cent; issue expenses capped at 4.5 per cent. Terms. Shares are on offer at 100p, with warrants attached on a one-for-five basis. Pepable? Yes, for an annual fee of 0.5 per cent on top of the 0.75 per cent annual management charge on the trust and an initial charge of 5.25 per cent. Minimum investment in the Pep is Pounds 3,000. Special terms. The initial Pep charge is waived during the launch period planned for February 9-March 2. Those investing solely in the Pep will receive free warrants during the launch. Comment. Schroder already has a successful UK growth unit trust and the investment trusts will be managed by the same team. The UK Enterprise trust, launched in 1988, is second in its sector in the five years to January 1 and fourth in the three years to January 1, according to Micropal. EFM Name. Edinburgh New Tiger. Aims. Long term capital growth by investing in quoted smaller companies in emerging Asian countries. Yield. Zero. Minimum investment. Pounds 1,000 (monthly savings scheme to be launched later). Charges. Issue expenses capped at 4 per cent. Annual management fee 1.2 per cent. Terms. Ordinary shares offered at 50p, with one free warrant attached to every five shares. Offer period January 29 to February 18. Pepable? No. Comment. This trust's target area - which includes India and China - is home to more than half the world's population, and is developing rapidly. Its economies are growing at an average of more than 6 per cent a year. Smaller companies have so far escaped the close attention of international investors, so their shares are not yet overvalued. These are volatile markets, and the ride could be very rough at times, but investors taking a long-term view should be rewarded. The same team is already responsible for the successful EFM Dragon trust. MARTIN CURRIE Name. Asian Opportunities. Aims. To achieve capital growth through investment in Asian markets (excluding Japan and Australasia). Minimum investment. Pounds 1,000 Charges. 6 per cent initial; 1.25 annual management fee. Special terms. Initial charge reduced to 5 per cent during the launch period scheduled for February 14-28. Pepable? Yes, at no extra cost but only qualifies for a maximum Pep investment of Pounds 1,500, since more than 50 per cent of the investment is outside the EC. Comment. Martin Currie says the fund will complete its Far East range which comprise a Japan fund and a Far East including Japan fund. It launched an offshore Indian Opportunities fund last year and has an Emerging Markets fund. Its International Growth fund has a good track record and came second in its sector in the 10 years to January 1, according to HSW. The markets of Asia are volatile but Martin Currie hopes that since the new fund will have a broad spread of investments from China to the Middle East, risk will be lessened.</p>

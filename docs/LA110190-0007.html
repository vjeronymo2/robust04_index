			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TIME MELLOWS COMMUNITY COLLEGE ELECTIONS;  </P> <P> POLITICS: DEPARTURE OF LONG-ENTRENCHED TRUSTEES HAS ENDED THE RANCOR THAT ONCE  MARKED CAMPAIGNS.  </P> <P> What a difference a couple of years make.  </P> <P> In 1988, the San Diego Community College District was awash in controversy,  with distrust between the faculty and a long-entrenched board of trustees over  a stagnant educational philosophy, the personality of administrative leaders  and an unusual financial arrangement for a district foundation.  </P> <P> Two years later, district relationships have moved light-years from those  times, with two new board members elected in November 1988, two new  administrators widely praised by faculty and community alike and a solution to  the festering foundation issue.  </P> <P> So, in contrast to past elections, the campaigns this fall for three of the  five trustee seats have been marked not by rancor or back-biting on philosophy  or personality, but more traditional debate -- rare in many campaigns these  days -- over who is more qualified to continue and improve upon present  district policies.  </P> <P> None of the three incumbents, two retiring after 17 years and a third after  nine years, chose to stand for reelection. With the 1988 election of reform  candidates Evonne Schulze and Fred Colby, all trustees after the November  balloting will have come aboard within the past two years, symbolizing the  change that has swept the district.  </P> <P> The San Diego district is the second-largest among California's 71 community  college districts, providing vocational and part-time education to working  students, as well as preparing others who are unable at first to meet  four-year-college financial or academic entry requirements for transfer to the  UC and Cal State systems .  </P> <P> In District A, which covers the Point Loma and beach areas, Yvonne Larsen is  running against Kara Kobey. Larsen took 41% of the June primary vote to Kobey's  30.5% preparatory to the citywide runoff next week.  </P> <P> Larsen, 59, has a long record of involvement in both San Diego and national  educational activities, which she points to as proof of her ability to handle  matters at the community college level, with its $230-million annual budget,  its 120,000 full- and part-time students, and its 7,000 faculty and other  employees. The district has three campuses -- Mesa, City and Miramar -- as well  as numerous continuing education centers throughout the city.  </P> <P> Larsen, a San Diego State graduate, served eight years on the San Diego Unified  School District board, which governs kindergarten-through-12th grade policies  in the city, was a trustee of the California State University system, and held  the vice chairman role on the 1981 National Commission on Excellence in  Education. That commission produced the watershed "Nation at Risk" study in  1983, from which nationwide reforms have since emanated.  </P> <P> Larsen has stressed her management experience at numerous candidate forums,  saying she knows how to "stand and fight" when things do not always run  smoothly. Larsen wants the district to offer more literacy programs, put more  technology into its classrooms and act more creatively with the San Diego  school district in devising programs for preventing and recapturing dropouts.  </P> <P> Kobey, 32, is making her first run at elected office, saying she herself  benefited from the community colleges -- she is a 1982 graduate of Mesa before  going on to San Diego State -- and wants to return something.  </P> <P> Kobey, best known as the daughter of the late Monte Kobey and his famous swap  meets, calls for more rapid completion of Miramar College, the district's  newest, and for renovation of Mesa, now severely crowded after more than 25  years of use.  </P> <P> Kobey also advocates more trade partnerships between private businesses and  vocational programs at the colleges, saying such links could provide students  with a more realistic understanding of how their training will pay off with  private industry.  </P> <P> "I know the value of a community college education, and I know how useful it  can be to those who go on to other study," Kobey said.  </P> <P> In District A, Miramar College political science and physical education  professor Robert Bacon, 57, is paired against Maria Senour, a professor of  counseling education at San Diego State. Senour won 48.3% of the primary vote  against Bacon's 16.7% in the district, which covers the northern tier of the  city.  </P> <P> Senour, 46, a graduate of Marygrove College in Detroit, has emphasized her  experience in training counselors, since a large part of the district's  challenge is in retaining more ethnic-minority students after they begin their  studies. Senour also would like Mesa's renovation to be moved higher on  district capital improvement lists, as well as have an expansion of the  transfer guarantee program that automatically ensures students entry in their  junior year to UC San Diego if they complete a prescribed course of study.  </P> <P> "I see the community colleges as particularly important for poor people  economically," Senior said. "For many students, the push to succeed comes from  educators who take the time to help, and the community colleges need more  people who can personally touch a student in some way . . . to be role models  in making a personal outreach."  </P> <P> Bacon, 57, has taught at district sites for 31 years and is known to legions of  longtime San Diegans for his tennis instruction. A San Diego State graduate, he  has been a professor at Miramar the past 12 years and was the president of the  faculty senate for the past two years.  </P> <P> Bacon reflects the view of all the candidates in saying that "this is a good  district already, which can be made better" and he stresses his familiarity  with Assembly Bill 1725, the 1988 state legislation that requires sweeping  changes in the state community college system, both in educational offerings  and in improving the quality of full-time faculty.  </P> <P> As Miramar faculty senate president, Bacon had a role in the district's record  of hiring almost 50% new faculty from nonwhite applicants in an effort to have  its professorial staff represent more closely the multiethnic mix of its  student body.  </P> <P> As a trustee, Bacon would work to increase academic course offerings and  especially try to improve the college libraries, which have suffered along with  libraries throughout the state's educational system because of budget cuts and  higher costs for periodicals and specialized serials.  </P> <P> Hope Logan and Denise Ducheny are the finalists in District E, which  encompasses many of the city's nonwhite neighborhoods including Logan Heights,  Southeast San Diego, Paradise Hills and Encanto. Logan garnered 51.6% of the  primary vote, and Ducheny won 24.7%.  </P> <P> The 68-year-old Logan is well-known for her longtime community and educational  activism. She has served as an officer of the Urban League of San Diego, as a  member of the city's Civil Service Commission and as a member of the San Diego  Community Foundation board of directors.  </P> <P> Logan, a graduate of UCLA, also was a lecturer for many years at San Diego  State and chairwoman of an education committee for the National Assn. for the  Advancement of Colored People.  </P> <P> As a product of public schools, Logan said the community colleges are the last  hope for many young people who otherwise have no future as productive citizens.  </P> <P> "For some time, I've seen too many children who complete 12th grade with  nothing for them to do; they are not yet educated or trained to get a job," she  said.  </P> <P> Logan said she would work hard to fulfill the obligation of community colleges  to serve the "underclass" with literacy and up-to-date vocational educational  classes.  </P> <P> Ducheny, 37, is equally known throughout the Southeast San Diego area for  advocacy in support of minorities.  </P> <P> A Pomona College graduate and practicing attorney, Ducheny and her husband, Al,  have lobbied for community interests in Barrio Logan and Southeast San Diego on  a variety of City Council and Port of San Diego issues. Ducheny would follow  that pattern as a trustee, lobbying for more literacy and vocational education  programs, for better academic preparation under the transfer agreement programs  and for better libraries.  </P> <P> "This is a board that can do a lot more, especially with City College  (downtown) and at the Educational Cultural Complex (in Southeast San Diego) to  get more people the education that they need," Ducheny said. She would push for  more partnerships with both the private sector and public agencies, and to  boost counseling efforts.  </P></p>

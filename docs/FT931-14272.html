			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Survey of The European Single Market (28): A non-migratory species - Retail banks prefer to stay in their own national High Streets ANYONE walking down the high street of a provincial European town is unlikely to encounter a foreign bank. In Margate's high street, there are branches of Midland, Lloyds, National Westminster and Barclays. Across the channel in Dieppe, Credit Lyonnais, Credit Agricole and Banque Nationale de Paris are to be found. But the French banks have not migrated en masse to the UK nor have the British ones to France. This may seem odd, given that banking is regarded as one of the more international industries. Indeed, the provision of banking services to big companies became a transnational business long before the European Community single market programme began to take shape. However, retail banking - providing services to individuals and small companies - is still on the whole a domestic business. A range of cultural, tax and regulatory obstacles have combined to prevent the creation of a single market in retail banking products. A typical example of a barrier to international competition was encountered recently by the UK bank Barclays in France. In the autumn, it tried to get around a French government ban on interest-bearing current accounts by launching a new product which combined a non-interest paying current account with an automatic sweep mechanism to shift a customer's surplus funds into a money market account. There was uproar from French banks, which were concerned that their profitability would be squeezed if they responded by offering similar products. However, the French finance minister, Mr Michel Sapin, came to their rescue in mid October by announcing a prohibition on automatic sweep mechanisms. So Barclays was deprived of the ability to market a product widely available in the rest of Europe - to the possible detriment of French consumers. This incident illustrates the severe limits of the single market programme to encourage genuine international competition in retail banking. The various European Community banking directives which come into effect on January 1 will do nothing to remove such barriers to competition. They relate mainly to the levels of capital which EC banks must have to continue in business (The Own Funds and Solvency Ratio directives) and the way in which banks are supervised (the Second Consolidated Supervision Directive and the Second Banking Directive). The Second Banking Directive is the most important new EC banking legislation. It creates a 'passport' for EC banks, which allows any bank authorised to do business in an EC country to set up branches in another EC country, without the need to get the permission of the supervisor in that other country. In theory, therefore, it reduces the costs and complications for EC-based banks of expanding within the EC. An example of a cost-saving move which some banks are contemplating as a result of the directive is to convert various subsidiaries scattered throughout Europe into branches. This would release capital held by each of the subsidiaries for use by the parent bank. The directive will have more significant ramifications for bank supervisors. The Bank of England will for example spend far less time monitoring the financial affairs of branches of foreign EC banks. The Bank's supervisory department will continue to take an interest in the liquidity of such a branch, but responsibility for monitoring its financial health in a more detailed way will rest with the parent bank's domestic supervisor. Because there remain significant obstacles to success in transnational retail banking within the EC, no bank is currently engaged in developing a Europe-wide network of branches. Though a number of banks, such as Barclays, National Westminster, Credit Lyonnais and Deutsche, have retail networks in different countries, they have typically managed each country's network as an autonomous business - with its own local brand name, financial system and management. Only one bank has attempted to use its own brand name, system and products in branches scattered throughout several European countries. Paradoxically this bank is not European, but is America's Citibank. The record of Citibank's European operations has been patchy. For the time being, therefore, European banks may use computers rather than expensive branches to deliver services across frontiers within the EC. The way forward may have been shown by Royal Bank of Scotland, which has developed an electronic system, IBOS, for linking its branches with those of Credit Commercial de France, Spain's Banco Santander and Banco de Comercio e Industria in Portugal. The idea is that any customer of one of these banks, whether a company or individual, can have access to a full range of banking services even if he or she is travelling abroad within Europe. Although RBS's plan for EC banking may not be Napoleonic in its ambition, it has the virtue that the costs of IBOS are modest - which is reassuring given the chequered history of most banks' ventures outside their home territories.</p>

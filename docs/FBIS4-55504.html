			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by E.O.: "Three-Fourths of People Do not Approve of </F> President; Lech Walesa Loses Support"]    [Text] In April, only 25 percent of the people approved of  the president's activities, whereas 64 percent were critical of  them. A previous opinion poll carried out by the Public Opinion  Research Center [CBOS] last February shows that Lech Walesa's  popularity dropped by 10 points. In the group of authority  centers, the president occupied the last position in April as  far as his activities were concerned.    Lech Walesa's popularity in the social opinion has been  dropping steadily since the middle of 1991. In April 1991, his  activities were approved by 70 percent of the respondents to a  CBOS poll. The 25-percent approval for Lech Walesa, declared by  the CBOS respondents, has been the lowest since the time he took  over the office.    As it turned out, Lech Walesa's conflict with the governing  coalition (numerous vetoes and public shows of disapproval),  which took place between February and April of this year, was  most detrimental to the president himself--he lost as many as 10  points in popularity opinion polls (in February, 35 percent of  respondents approved of his activities and 55 percent expressed  their disapproval).    Thus, the office of the president found itself in the second  to last position in the popularity ranking of various  establishments. The people declare less trust only for private  banks (21 percent approve of them).    The statistical supporter of Lech Walesa is either younger  than 25 or older than 65, has rightist political views, and  takes part in religious activities several times a week. Among  employed people, he is primarily backed by skilled workers and  among professionally passive people--by senior citizens,  disabled pensioners, and unemployed people.    The people declare the greatest trust for the Army (76  percent), the spokesman for civil rights (70 percent), and  public television (69 percent).    Probably because of the "corruption affair" in Poznan,  approval for police activities decreased by nearly 10 points;  however, its activities are still accepted by as many as 57  percent of the people--just as many people support the  activities of self-governments in their regions.    The government and the Sejm are enjoying double the  popularity of the president. Within the past two months, there  has also been an increase in the approval of the activities of  the Senate, whose activities were accepted by 41 percent of the  respondents in April of this year.  <H8>  * * * </H8>   The opinion poll was carried out between 14 and 18 April of  this year on a representative sample of 1,207 adult inhabitants  of the country.</p>

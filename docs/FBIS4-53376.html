			<p>BFN     [Text] South Sulawesi, a province of Indonesia, recently  signed a memorandum of understanding for the East ASEAN growth  polygon (EAGP).    The EAGP is an economic cooperation of 12 focus areas in the  East ASEAN region. Its main aim is to promote trade and  investment in the region through mutual and beneficial endeavors  that include shipping, transportation and communications,  agriculture, fisheries, agro-forestry, industries, and tourism.    With a total land area of six million hectares, primarily  composed of agricultural and forest lands, South Sulawesi  occupies about 42 percent of the Sulawesi Island. Its main  source of livelihood is agriculture, fishery, and agro-forestry.    An annual economic growth rate of 5.6 percent has made South  Sulawesi one of the most attractive investment areas in the East  ASEAN region. A high rate of productivity has made the province  a leading exporter of rice. In 1991, it recorded 1.4 million  tons of rice surplus.    However, the agriculture sector lacks the facilities for  agri-processing that can transform harvests into high-value  goods. But the high potential remains in the non-traditional  crops like coffee, cocoa, cashew nut, candle nut, crude palm  oil, and others.    The fishery sector also poses a high potential area for  investment particularly in prawn production, frozen shrimp, and  cuttle fish. Again, processing of these products is needed to  further boost the fishery industry.    Livestock production shows great potential particularly  cattle, goat, sheep, hog and poultry raising, both for domestic  and export consumption.    Export of forest products has likewise a big potential  because of the abundance of forest resources in this Indonesian  province, covering about 3.6 million hectares.</p>

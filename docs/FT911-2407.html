			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Judge to rule on aircraft hit by tractor A HIGH court action to determine liability for Dollars 1m (Pounds 600,000) damage allegedly caused when a runaway tractor hit a US Air Force aircraft began yesterday. The Trackair tractor collided with the left wing of the stationary TR1 spyplane at RAF Alconbury, Cambridgeshire, in December 1987. Two companies face the US government in the five-day hearing to determine liability. The court will decide whether the owner or the user of the tractor should pay the bill. ARC Construction of Abingdon, Oxfordshire, the user, and HS Isis Hire, of Redditch, Hereford and Worcester, the owner, both deny negligence. Mr Charles Falconer, QC, told Mr Justice Hobhouse that ARC was using the tractor for asphalt work at the airfield. Its driver left the vehicle without its handbrake on and with no chocks in front of its wheels. The tractor moved off without the driver, who chased after it trying in vain to clamber into the cab. The aircraft's pilot could only release its brakes to reduce the impact. The hearing continues.</p>

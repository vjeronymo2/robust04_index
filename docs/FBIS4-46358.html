Gen.  Corado offered the Army's cooperation in this regard, although  this institution is not responsible for public security. The  self-styled Domingo Monterrosa Command this week issued an  anonymous message making death threats against several  officials, including Human Rights Ombudsman Carlos Mauricio  Molina Fonseca. Nationalist Republican Alliance Deputy Carmen  Calderon de Escalon also received a death threat on the phone.  Corado said that these actions will have to be neutralized so  that these threats do not materialize.

We have always said that, although  public security is not our main responsibility, we are always in  touch with the Public Security Ministry and, previously, with  the National Police and National Civilian Police to use our  resources to begin joint action with them designed to counter  these threats.

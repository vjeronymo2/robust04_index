			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Dusan Radovanovic from Paris] </F>   [Text] Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic, who  has been paying a working visit to France at the invitation of  the French foreign minister since yesterday, is today continuing  talks with prominent French leaders. After very useful and  frank talks with French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe last night  on all aspects of the Yugoslav crisis, our foreign minister will  today meet Hubert Vedrine, secretary general of the Elysee  Palace, who is the closest associate of French President  Mitterrand.    Jovanovic will also hold talks with General Schmid, personal  adviser of the French prime minister for military issues, and  (Savior Deviliten), chairman of the French Senate Commission for  Foreign Affairs. In all the talks so far, especially with  Foreign Minister Juppe, the Yugoslav foreign minister, as we  have learned, stressed the discrepancy between French policies  and the new reality in the Bosnian conflict and the Yugoslav  crisis as a whole. He pointed out the need for Paris to carry  out the necessary changes and to persuade both the European  Union and the world community to adopt a more balanced approach,  to abandon its selective policy, and to realize the advantages  of treating all sides in the Yugoslav crisis in the same way.    In the context of the U.S. plan and the European initiative,  the Yugoslav side stressed during all talks the untenability of  the sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY].  The sanctions represent an enormous obstacle to positive  solutions. The Yugoslav side also noted that Yugoslavia has met  all the demands contained in the European plan, while the  European Union has completely ignored its obligations.</p>

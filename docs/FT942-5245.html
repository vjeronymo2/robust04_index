			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Management: Desert Island Manager - John Hegarty Should John Hegarty be stuck on a desert island there would be a lot of upset entrants in the London Evening Standard's fantasy advertising league. Such is his reputation within the industry that the creative director of advertising agency Bartle, Bogle, Hegarty figures as star striker in the vast majority of top team selections. If you could take one person with you who would it be? Michelangelo would be good because he was one of the great art directors. But then the church was one of the first great advertising clients. He and I could have good conversations about how we visualise things. Which additional item would you need for the beachside office, apart from a fax and telephone? A lay-out pad so that I could put ideas down. If ideas stay in your head they forever perambulate around. The frustration of not being able to put them on paper would drive me mad. Which extra sanity preserver would you opt for? I would probably learn about the flora and fauna. I detest gardening. My father was a gardener and I think you always rebel against what your parents did. So although I loathe it, I realise I am missing out. What would you dislike about being on the island? Perennial sunshine. The fact that it rains a lot in Britain makes us think more. I would hate constant sunshine although it is nice to have on occasions. And like? An uncomplicated life. The ability to concentrate and not be diverted, to be able to focus your mind. Some food and drink that you would enjoy? If I'd asked Michelangelo, I would probably go for pasta because it would suit him, although with my Irish heritage I would also like to go for the potato. They are underrated and seen as a commodity. But then, sitting there with Michelangelo we would have some pasta and I would have a nice bottle of chianti. A film for after dinner? The Godfather, and I would hope to cheat and take the trilogy. It is the most perfect film in terms of photography, music and the themes it explores. Something to read? James Stephens's The Crock of Gold which is all about two philosophers arguing about the meaning of life. It contains a line which I have always found very profound: 'What the heart knows today, the head will know tomorrow.' You can send a message in a bottle from the island, what would it be? 'Remember that good is the enemy of great.' On your island, you can impose one condition: That I would only be there for a limited time. Knowing we have a limited amount of time makes us productive. I've always thought a great description of hell would be eternal life because there would be no reason to do anything then.</p>

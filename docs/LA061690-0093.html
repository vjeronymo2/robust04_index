			<p><P> June 16, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> REPORT ON KILLING BY DEPUTY SENT  </P> <P> The Sheriff's Department on Friday forwarded to the district attorney's office  and the San Diego County Grand Jury its 430-page investigative report into the  May 18 shooting death of 21-year-old Jeffrey Bray in Vista.  </P> <P> The report, which was not publicly released, contained no conclusions of its  own, sheriff's spokesman Deputy Robbie Hill said.  </P> <P> District attorney spokesman Linda Miller said the report will be reviewed by  the D.A.'s special operations division, which will conduct its own, independent  investigation.  </P> <P> The district attorney's office, Miller said, will decide whether criminal  charges should be filed against sheriff's reserve deputy John Wickham, who shot  and killed Bray when Bray stopped his vehicle in a Vista apartment complex,  then backed up into the sheriff's patrol car that had followed him up the  driveway.  </P> <P> Wickham and Deputy William C. Fewell had followed Bray into the apartment's  parking lot because they suspected that Bray was driving a stolen vehicle. He  was not.  </P> <P> An eyewitness told The Times that he yelled out to Bray as Bray drove up the  driveway, and that Bray simply stopped his car and backed up to talk to him  without realizing that the sheriff's patrol car had pulled up behind him. Bray  was killed by a single shot to his head at just about the moment the two  vehicles collided.  </P> <P> Bray's parents on Thursday filed a wrongful-death claim against the county,  seeking unspecified damages. Bray's widow earlier had filed a similar claim.  </P> <P> The claim by Joe and Brenda Bray of Conway, Ark., alleges that Wickham and  Fewell "improperly shot and killed Jeffrey Bray without justification or cause.  . . . without warning and in violation of proper police procedure."  </P> <P> The claim also named the county as a responsible party because it "failed to  exercise reasonable care in promulgating policy, regulations and directives  which resulted" in the shooting.  </P> <P> The Sheriff's Department review of Bray's death was completed four weeks to the  day after the shooting, which sparked widespread criticism of the department  and allegations that the deputies overreacted by shooting Bray after his  vehicle backed into theirs.  </P> <P> The County Board of Supervisors has asked the grand jury to review the  shooting, a request that is expected to be taken up after the 1990-91 grand  jury is seated July 1. The FBI is also conducting an investigation to see  whether Bray's civil rights were violated.  </P> <P> The Sheriff's Department material included not only a 430-page report, which  represented its own internal investigation and interviews with witnesses, but  also tapes and clippings of media coverage, photographs and tape-recorded  interviews of witnesses, Hill said.  </P> <P> "It's not the intention of our department to find a conclusion," Hill said.  "We're providing the facts and evidence of the investigation, for the district  attorney's review."  </P> <P> Miller said D.A. investigators will look beyond the sheriff's report before  making its own conclusion.  </P> <P> "We will conduct our own, independent investigation," Miller said. "We'll use  some of the material provided by the sheriff's office, but we'll do our own,  complete investigation, interview witnesses ourselves, maybe request additional  lab work, the whole gamut. This will probably take a while."  </P> <P> She noted that the district attorney will not review the Sheriff's Department  shooting policy or guidelines on the use of deadly force, but rather simply  review the shooting "for any criminal conduct on the part of the officer."  </P> <P> "If we find none, we'll write a letter to the sheriff, explaining in some  detail our findings and giving him a conclusion of our investigation. If we  find criminal conduct on the part of the officer, we'll file charges to  prosecute," Miller said.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Aleksander Hall, Polish Conservative Party </F> chairman, by correspondent Wanda Jurczak; place and date not  given]    [Text] [Jurczak] Why do you consistently pass such an  emphatically negative judgment on the government coalition camp  in your public utterances?    [Hall] First, it is more than obvious that the government  coalition has no cohesive program of state reforms. What they  do is neither continuation of the work of their predecessors nor  its demolition. On the other hand, in such areas as, say,  reforms of the health service and the budget-funded sector, we  can expect continuing stagnation. It is obvious that the  process of privatization is already being hampered in its  progress. Nor do I believe that the present government  coalition is capable of successfully resisting public pressure.  In contrast to this, we know that both Leszek Balcerowicz and  Hanna Suchocka's entire government were perfectly able to take  risks for the sake of certain overriding interests and were even  prepared to enter into conflict with a substantial proportion of  the general public for the sake of these interests. Today we  cannot find any evidence of such firm principles. Finally,  there is a clearly discernible return to the policy of making  politically inspired appointments to key state offices. Such  appointments are often entrusted to people who were politically  active in the past, although not always in association with the  Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] or the Polish Peasant Party  [PSL]. The government coalition promotes a vision of a strongly  centralized state, with a powerful central administration. The  way to counteract such ambitions is to give significant powers  to local self-government structures and regional communities.  This is our concept of running things.    [Jurczak] But the president has expressed a strongly  negative opinion of the political configuration existing outside  the government coalition.    [Hall] In my view, the president should refrain from using  such strong expressions which are loaded with negative messages.  On the other hand, it is true that very many politicians from  the post-Solidarity camp have failed to pass the test as  statesmen and leaders of the nation. I do not know whether the  president was referring also to me in his utterance. I hope he  was not.    [Jurczak] To go back to your own patch, do you believe that  Kazimierz Michal Ujazdowski was right when he accused you of  attempting to cause a split in your party?    [Hall] We are now well and truly "divorced," and a group of  our former colleagues, including Mr. Ujazdowski, have left the  Conservative Party. In any case, they are not a particularly  large group, and in the past they demonstrated considerable  political talent when they were setting up our party. Mr.  Ujazdowski's future plans are precise and clear-cut: He intends  to set up a compound political party together with the Christian  National Union [ZChN], the Center Alliance [PC], and the  PSL-Peasant Alliance. It is his God-given right to do so. We,  on the other hand, intend to continue investing in the  Conservative Party and a future conservative-liberal camp which  should eventually be created in Poland.    [Jurczak] Has your party worked out a strategy that could  help you achieve success in the forthcoming local  self-government elections?    [Hall] We operate within the framework of an agreement  between different political programs, dubbed the 11 November  Agreement, but in the local self-government elections our  structures will retain considerable freedom of maneuver as  regards selection of political allies--excluding, of course, the  ruling government coalition and Union of Labor. In order to be  able to create wide-ranging political alliances, we should  ideally set up alliance structures in every city, each embracing  a spectrum of parties from the Democratic Union through the  ZChN. This is because we will have a very strong adversary on  the other side, namely the SLD in urban centers and the PSL in  the rural sector. This challenge will oblige us to concentrate  our forces. That will not be possible everywhere, but I believe  that such a tactic will be most desirable. Moreover, I believe  that it is improper practice to change the electoral law at  short notice before the elections; I believe that the local  self-government elections should be conducted on the base of the  old electoral law, which is, in any case, still in force today.    [Jurczak] Thank you for talking to us.</p>

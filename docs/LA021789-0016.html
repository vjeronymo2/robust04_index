			<p><P> February 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEWS;  </P> <P> MACHISMO IS THE BIG JOKE IN 'SUCKA'  </P> <P> In Keenen Ivory Wayans' "I'm Gonna Git You Sucka" (citywide), there's sometimes  a light line between sendup and near-celebration.  </P> <P> The movie is a satire of the early '70s blaxploitation action movies: all the  "Shafts," "Black Caesars" and "Superflys" with their natty, super-masculine  heroes, flamboyant pimps and murderous drug czars. Its most obvious model is  1980's "Airplane!" But, where the Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker "Airplane!" team  probably didn't much like the disaster movies they spoofed, Wayans is  satirizing something he's closer to: urban street culture and the black  super-heroes of his movie-going youth. On one level, he is having a giggle at  the inflated, phony imagery. On another, maybe he misses it.  </P> <P> Wayans, an engaging comic with a sweet smile, casts himself here as returning  Army veteran Jack Spade. Machismo is a joke in "Sucka"; Spade is a mama's boy  whose 10-year Army hitch won him medals for surfing and good conduct. Returning  home to his mama (the formidable Ja'net Dubois), his dead brother's willing  widow (Dawnn Lewis), and to a neighborhood despoiled by the vile depredations  of vice-lord Mr. Big (John Vernon, once again coming up like thunder), Jack  searches somewhere, anywhere, for a hero to model himself after.  </P> <P> He finds, successively, supercop Slade (Bernie Casey of "Hit Man"), superpimp  Flyguy (Antonio Fargas of "Cleopatra Jones"), rough-neck soul food titans  Slammer and Hammer (Jim Brown of "Slaughter" and Isaac Hayes of "Truck Turner")  and karate king Kung Fu Joe (Steve James of "American Ninja"), all of whom do  straight-faced "Airplane!"-style sendups of their old or current image -- and  all of whom, in the end, prove less ferocious than Jack's mama.  </P> <P> Wayans' directing isn't up to his writing, and his writing isn't always up to  his acting. And he misses one aspect of the black actioners almost completely:  their pace and zonked-out, overheated style. He is also guilty of an occasional  gross, tasteless scene, like the "take it all off" encounter with lascivious  bar-girl Cherry, a woman of many parts.  </P> <P> There are misfires in "Sucka," (MPAA rated R for language) but there's also  some funny stuff. Wayans shows a refreshing taste for self-mockery, something  his old "Raw" colleague, Eddie Murphy, might study. In one scene, as a gorgeous  cabaret singer gives a shockingly bad rendition of "When the Saints Go Marching  In" in pseudo-Sarah Vaughan style, the waiter explains to stunned patrons that  she gets away with it because she is the director's sister. As it turns out,  she (Kim Wayans) really is. MICHAEL WILMINGTON  </P></p>

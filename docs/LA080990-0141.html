			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MENTAL HEALTH, JUVENILE SERVICES CUTS ON HOLD  </P> <P> The County Board of Supervisors' decision Tuesday to hold off on a proposed  $39.7-million countywide cutback in mental health services saved about a dozen  San Gabriel Valley mental health clinics from immediate closure or severe  reductions of service.  </P> <P> The board also held off on imposing $1.94 million in cuts to juvenile programs  that would have affected counseling programs at the Boys Club of San Gabriel  Valley in El Monte and Boys Republic in Monrovia.  </P> <P> But by tying the future of the county's mental health budget to passage in  November of Proposition 134 -- the statewide, 5-cent-a-drink alcohol tax  initiative -- the board created uncertainty in the clinics for the next three  months, social service providers said.  </P> <P> "I guess the good news is we have a breather," said Wayne Soucy, executive vice  president of Pacific Clinics, a mental health counseling service that operates  in four San Gabriel Valley cities. "It gives us more time for a rational  approach to curtailment, if that occurs."  </P> <P> But Soucy said the uncertain funding "creates tremendous uncertainty in the  minds of patients."  </P> <P> "Literally, it's bothering all of them," he said.  </P> <P> San Gabriel Valley clinics that have been given a three-month reprieve include  the Almansor Center in South Pasadena, Foothill Community Mental Health in  Glendora, La Puente Valley Mental Health Center in La Puente and Mid-Valley  Community Mental Health Center in Baldwin Park.  </P> <P> The action taken Tuesday by the supervisors keeps current mental health funding  levels in place until Nov. 15. Statewide mental health budget cuts imposed last  week by Gov. George Deukmejian, coupled with a county mental health budget  deficit of $10 million, would have meant about $8 million in cuts to San  Gabriel Valley mental health care providers.  </P> <P> But with about $32 million in mental health funds expected if the alcohol tax  initiative passes Nov. 9, the board decided to hold off on mental health cuts  until then.  </P> <P> "It's just a big gamble," said Ann Stone, associate director of the Los Angeles  Mental Health Assn. Stone added that mental health care providers will now turn  their efforts to lobbying for passage of the tax measure to save the state's  ailing mental health system. But Soucy said he fears that some ads by the  liquor industry against the tax measure "are so negative and so misleading they  could sway the public."  </P> <P> If the measure doesn't pass, the county will have to impose even greater cuts  in November. If that happens, clinics will be hit even harder, Soucy said.  </P> <P> The board's decision to keep current funding of juvenile programs was similarly  tied to state action, said John Farley, division chief of the County Department  of Community and Senior Citizen Services.  </P> <P> State legislators in September are expected to amend Senate Bill 2433 to  provide money for the juvenile programs. Even if they do not pass the measure,  Farley said, county money is available to provide $1.9 million to juvenile  service contractors, such as the two in San Gabriel Valley, and an additional  $10 million to the county probation department for its juvenile programs.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> L.A. BLAMED FOR ALLOWING DEVELOPMENT ON HILLSIDE;  </P> <P> BRAUDE FOCUS OF CRITICISM AT WOODLAND HILLS MEETING  </P> <P> Angry Woodland Hills homeowners confronted Los Angeles City Councilman Marvin  Braude on Thursday to repeat their charges that city officials were negligent  in allowing a condominium project to be built on a hill above their  neighborhood.  </P> <P> The residents, who met with Braude in the front yard of a home directly below  the $7.5-million West Hills Condominiums, said the city Building and Safety  Department permitted the developer to build the complex higher than legally  allowed and was lax in enforcing requirements for landscaping of the  development.  </P> <P> They complained that the complex is so big and ugly that it lowered property  values in their 30-year-old neighborhood.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Homeowners' Leader  </P> <P> "This whole thing could have been stopped when all that was up there was a  bunch of 2 by 4s," said Hope Perry, a Kelvin Avenue resident who, with her  husband Sid, has helped lead opposition to the project. "But the city just let  this go on and on. Now look what we've got."  </P> <P> Although several residents raised their voices, the tone was more conciliatory  than hostile toward Braude, who was blasted by a group of Encino homeowners a  week earlier in a development dispute that set off fistfights.  </P> <P> Braude calmly told the Woodland Hills group that, despite their unhappiness and  some pending questions about the project, the complex was on the hill to stay.  </P> <P> "My own feeling is that you should be prepared to live with this development,"  Braude said. "You've expressed all the things you can regarding this. Now is  the time to start healing and move on. You should start to work together to  protect the community."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Review Termed Unique  </P> <P> The councilman added that there had been "more review of this project than any  other project in the history of the city."  </P> <P> Development partner James R. Gary, who said he was not invited to the meeting,  added that he was frustrated by the continuing complaints of homeowners.  </P> <P> "I've had it with this nonsense and misinformation that these folks are putting  out," Gary said. "We're not only complying with the laws, we're going beyond  compliance, according to the Department of Building and Safety."  </P> <P> The homeowners complained for months that the 80-unit project is illegal  because it violates building requirements set by the City Council's initial  approval in 1978.  </P> <P> Braude in April called for an investigation into approval of the project after  construction permit irregularities were discovered. He said it needed to be  determined once and for all whether the project is too tall, too wide or  deficient in parking, as neighbors claimed.  </P> <P> City zoning officials ruled in May that several loft structures atop the  building exceeded a 45-foot height requirement imposed by the city 10 years ago  and must be altered.  </P> <P> The Board of Zoning Appeals is scheduled to hear an appeal by the developer of  that decision Sept. 5.  </P> <P> Braude said Chief Zoning Administrator Franklin P. Eberhard will consider both  sides of the controversy. "I'm confident Frank Eberhard will be fair," he said.  "My sense is that it's in the hands of his department. If we can get  cooperation from the builder, we should try to get that. If you feel the past  has been bad, you must still move forward."  </P> <P> But Braude did not appear to mollify several members of the group.  </P> <P> "How do you compensate the financial loss to the homeowners?" asked Richard  Oedy, who has lived in the neighborhood for 22 years.  </P> <P> "There is no way to recoup that," Braude said softly.  </P> <P> Paula Corby, who lives below the project, said that despite many promises, the  developer had failed to put in landscaping to shield the project from view. "I  was guaranteed that the worst, the absolute worst we would see is the top of  the building," she said. "I was told it would look like a forest."  </P> <P> Most of the three-story building is visible from the streets below.  </P> <P> Gordon Murley, another resident, repeated a charge that the Building and Safety  Department had been unethical in approving the project.  </P> <P> It was the second time in two weeks that Braude faced angry San Fernando Valley  homeowners.  </P> <P> In a meeting last week, preceded by fistfights between rival homeowner groups,  Braude was criticized by Encino residents for wavering in his support of  proposals to extend Reseda Boulevard southward into the Santa Monica Mountains  in Tarzana.  </P> <P> Encino residents said Braude had pledged 10 years ago that he would support the  extension to alleviate heavy traffic on Encino streets that lead from the  Valley into the Los Angeles Basin. However, Braude changed his mind a few  months ago after protests by Tarzana residents, who oppose the extension.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEBUTANTE IN A SEAMY SUBCULTURE  </P> <P> Bad Behavior by Mary Gaitskill (Random House/Vintage: $7.95; 178 pp.,  0-679-72327-7)  </P> <P> </P> <P> "Bad Behavior," Mary Gaitskill's impressive debut collection of short stories,  recently published in paperback, runs a live wire into a seamy subculture of  artists, artistes and aspirants in New York City who live to "medicate" (take  drugs), who frequent gay and lesbian bars, who work as prostitutes while  battling for their dignity. Gaitskill stakes out her turf and writes  unsentimentally, with confidence and verve. She comes off as that rare author  who has lived whereof she speaks -- rather than attaching herself to a scene  and making ironic, Peeping Tomish notes about it.  </P> <P> Indeed, Gaitskill is the real thing. At 16, she fled her native Detroit for  Manhattan where she worked for four years panhandling in the streets and as a  strip-tease dancer. Later she studied at the University of Michigan and  graduated in 1981, winning a prestigious literary prize.  </P> <P> One of Gaitskill's most memorable stories, "A Romantic Weekend," is a graphic,  unsparing exploration of a tryst between a sadistic married man in search of a  woman to humiliate, and a disturbed, seemingly meek but inwardly rigid woman  who wants to lose, and unleash, herself in passion.  </P> <P> "On meeting Beth, he was astonished at how much she looked, talked and moved  like his former victim," Gaitskill writes. "She was delicately morbid in all  her gestures, sensitive, arrogant, vulnerable to flattery. She veered between  extravagant outbursts of opinion and sudden, uncertain halts, during which she  seemed to look to him for approval. She was in love with the idea of  intelligence, and she overestimated her own."  </P> <P> The adulterer's desire to make Beth a sex slave -- to beat her, urinate on her  and make her drink it and to eventually draw his delicate Korean wife into the  sordidness -- contrasts with Beth's fantasy of "swooning in his arms . . .  supported by a soft ball of puffy blue stuff." Gaitskill deftly alternates  between the two points of view as the story gains momentum with each emotional  twist and verbal parry.  </P> <P> Both parties wind up feeling cheated, and he begins hurling recriminations. "  'I don't think you're very sexual,' he said. 'You're not the way I thought you  were when I first met you.'  </P> <P> "She was so hurt by this," Gaitskill writes, "that she had difficulty  answering. Finally, she said, 'I can be very sexual or very unsexual depending  on who I'm with and in what situation.' "  </P> <P> Prostitution is a recurring theme in the collection -- the look and feel of a  present-day brothel. The stories humanize the hooker, the customer and the  sex-for-money exchange, shattering stereotypes. Here we have brainy, idealistic  hookers and forlorn, romantic johns.  </P> <P> In "Something Nice," Lisette -- a newcomer working girl whose real name is Jane  -- asks Fred, her second customer, how it's done. Smitten by her honesty, Fred  returns for more too often; Jane tries, and eventually succeeds at, pushing him  away.  </P> <P> " 'Do you really think it's a good idea for you to come see me every night?  It's awfully expensive. I know lawyers make a lot of money, but still. Won't  your wife wonder where it's going?'  </P> <P> ". . . 'Don't you see how special you are? No other girl I've seen like this  would ever have thought to say something like that. All they can think of is  how to get more money out of you. . . .'  </P> <P> " 'Aren't you worried about getting AIDS?'  </P> <P> " 'From a girl like you? C'mon, don't put yourself down.' "  </P> <P> Suffering pervades these tales: in "Secretary," the story of a young woman  sexually abused by her boss; in "Connection," about a woman longing for the  ex-best friend with whom she once shared "a complex system of reassurance and  support for self-involved fantasies"; and in "An Affair, Edited," when a man  bumps into a former lover whose presence he can't shake.  </P> <P> Gaitskill's stories are exciting to read because they make voyeurs of us the  way all good fiction should. You come away believing that you've gotten the  real goods about life on this particular edge.  </P> <P> The publication of "Bad Behavior" heralds the arrival of a strong, new talent  on the literary scene. Gaitskill's clear, direct and distinctive voice  humanizes this dark underbelly world, making understandable why people choose  to live there.  </P></p>

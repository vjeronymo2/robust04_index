			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Leading Article: A green target for Mr Bush The temperature of EC-US relations has been rising recently over - appropriately - the issue of global warming. The EC environment commissioner, Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, has criticised President George Bush for his refusal to commit the US to targets for reducing emissions of harmful gases which contribute to the greenhouse effect. Mr Bush, for his part, says he does not intend to support unrealistic environmental plans which could cost American jobs. It is easy to see why this bout of tension has arisen. Both men are highly exposed politically just now. Mr Ripa di Meana has staked out an ambitious green position in advance of the Earth Summit in Rio in June for which he needs to cultivate more political support, not least among the EC's own members. Ideally, he would like to be able to go to Rio brandishing an EC plan to attack carbon dioxide emissions with powerful weapons like a tax on energy and carbon. But a number of EC states have reservations about these ideas, and would certainly not agree to them unless they were sure their main non-EC trade competitors would follow suit. Mr Bush is at the height of an election campaign which has shown that the state of the US economy is a more prominent issue in voters' minds than greenery. As in many industrialised countries, recession has toppled the environment from its high place on the political agenda - so much so that Mr Bush is not even prepared to commit himself to attending the Rio summit, let alone subscribe to its outcome. Better track But if both men are guilty of taking a short-term view, Mr Ripa di Meana is on a better track. He has secured agreement, however tenuous, from the majority of EC states to reduce their carbon dioxide emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000 - all, that is, except the UK which has set a target date of 2005. The means by which he intends to achieve this may still be open to doubt: indeed without a carbon tax he would fall far short of his target. But at least the plan carries a commitment against which progress can be measured. The US - which emits proportionately far more carbon dioxide than the EC - has only produced an open-ended commitment to reduce emission levels. The administration argues that it is more important to establish the means before committing itself to targets. But the means created so far do not amount to very much, and are certainly not backed by any credible commitment from the White House. Indeed, so long as Mr Bush remains aloof from the Rio process, it will be impossible for the rest of the world to believe that the US has any serious interest in tackling environmental questions. Modest proposal His political opponents have tried to stir the issue - so far without much success. Mr Bill Clinton, the leading Democratic contender, has a modest proposal to raise gasoline taxes, and there are moves in the House of Representatives to force the Administration to set carbon dioxide emission targets. But there needs to be closer US-EC understanding for other reasons. The Rio summit is likely to be a grand bargaining session between the rich countries of the north and the poor ones of the south over who is to be responsible for safeguarding the environment. The rich countries have the money to do it, but they should also be setting an example. A failure among the major industrial nations to agree on the seriousness of the threat posed by carbon dioxide and global warming would rule out any likelihood of progress on these issues in Rio. There will be further talks in the coming weeks at which Rio participants, including the EC and the US, will try to conclude an international agreement on climate change for presentation at Rio. It has to be said, however, that the chances of narrowing the transatlantic gap do not look very strong. Unless Mr Bush's political opponents step up the attack on his environmental record and force him to respond, he has no reason to change his position. This, in turn, will give no encouragement to the more faint-hearted in the EC. Rio will achieve very little if Mr Bush does not attend with some firm targets in his pocket.</p>

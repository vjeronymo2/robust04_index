The process is a key part of reforms aimed at transforming  Czechoslovakia's centralized economy into a Western-style one guided by market  forces. Vendors staged nationwide strikes last month demanding they be given  first crack at buying the shops; instead, they will be sold off in a  complicated auction process.  </P></p>

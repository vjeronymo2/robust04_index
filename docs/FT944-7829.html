			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Dealers move into electronic motor trading An electronic auction system allowing 'live' trading of used cars between manufacturers, leasing companies and dealer networks throughout the country has been launched as a joint venture between the Midlands-based CMA auctions group and Mitac, the Motor Industry Training and Consultancy group. Citroen UK, Peugeot Talbot, Volkswagen/Audi and Honda are among manufacturers which have used the system to dispose of vehicles or are considering it. CMA Remarketing, the joint venture company, is planning to expand the 'remarketing' concept - of which the electronic auction system forms a part  -throughout Europe. Mr George Inch, CMA Group's chief executive, said yesterday that dealers in South Africa - like the UK, a right-hand-drive market - were buying through the system. The venture opens a potentially wider market to carmakers, importers and leasing and fleet operators in which to dispose of their vehicles. It is designed to help dealers locate a particular car being sought by a customer anywhere in the country, irrespective of make, or to help a dealership find alternative buyers for stock which is difficult to sell in its area. The number of used vehicles traded in the UK industry in recent years, before being put on sale on dealer forecourts, has swollen to several hundred thousand as a result of growth in the fleet car market, increasing turnover of rental fleets and the rapid rise in popularity among private buyers of 'personal contract' schemes, such as Ford's 'Options'. Traditionally, such vehicles are disposed of either through 'dealer-only' auctions or through individual manufacturers' dealer networks. But their numbers are now so great that they are no longer easily absorbed. The electronic auction - which uses satellite links - is the key element of a system which includes electronic stock location, sealed bid sales and telemarketing.</p>

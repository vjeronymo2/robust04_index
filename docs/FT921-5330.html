			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Masking turbulence with treasury flair - Abbey National's bad debt problems 'I THINK we are over the worst in the housing market,' said Mr Peter Birch, Abbey National chief executive, sitting in his Baker Street office surrounded by soothing if slightly predictable pictures of the great English medieval abbeys. Bland pictures seemed a fitting backdrop for what were on the face of them soothing and predictable results at a time of market turbulence. Abbey National's 1991 pre-tax profits landed almost exactly on target at Pounds 618m, 6.2 per cent above 1991 - and this despite a sharp increase in bad debt provisions, which soared from Pounds 55m a year ago to Pounds 155m. The result makes Abbey the second most profitable UK bank after Lloyds, well ahead of Barclays, even though Abbey National's total assets of Pounds 57.4bn are less than half those of Barclays. Other features of the results contained little to alarm the market. Losses at Cornerstone, Abbey National's estate agency operation, were down by Pounds 1m on 1990. The cost income ratio of 45.1 per cent was slightly up on last year, but still about 20 percentage points below those of most high street banks. Instead of hailing these results as a triumph, the market treated them with considerable caution. Abbey National's share price fell by 11p during the day and UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the City stockbrokers who know the company best, downgraded their recommendation from hold to sell. 'If you take out the huge jump in profits from treasury operations, which went up from Pounds 2m in 1990 to Pounds 62m last year, then you are left with a much less sparkling performance by Abbey National's core retail banking businesses,' said Mr John Wriglesworth, a UBS Phillips &amp; Drew banking analyst. The group's UK retail banking profits in fact went down by 4.5 per cent to Pounds 585m from Pounds 612m. The fall is entirely due to bad debt problems. Abbey National's heartland is still London and the south-east, the areas which have been hit hardest in the housing market recession. Without provisions, UK retail operations would have risen by 15 per cent to Pounds 772m. This lacklustre performance may not seem very surprising given the state of the UK housing market. Profits are expected to be well down this year at other large south-eastern based mortgage lenders such as Alliance &amp; Leicester and Woolwich building societies. But some large lenders have fared relatively well. Yorkshire Building Society is expected to announce a 20 per cent increase in its pre-tax profits this year. National &amp; Provincial, regarded for several years as one of the more troubled lenders in the industry, last week posted a 68 per cent increase in its pre-tax profits for 1991. The success of Abbey National's treasury operations reflects the fact that, like TSB, it is a bank sitting on a large chest of capital raised at the time of its flotation. Abbey National has engaged in some cautious diversification, creating a network of subsidiaries in Spain, Italy, and France with the single European market in mind, and last year it bought Scottish Mutual Life Assurance and is using the Scottish company to set up its own life assurance subsidiary. Mr Birch says that Abbey National does not want to risk wasting its capital on diversification which might go awry, like TSB's ill-fated purchase of Hill Samuel. In fact one post-flotation initiative, the strong new Treasury team created since 1989 under Mr Gareth Jones, was responsible for over half the group's balance sheet growth and 10 per cent of this year's profits. But Treasury operations are a volatile business where banks have to work hard to earn even small margins. Mr Jones's team is unlikely to be able to pull off the same feat two years running. Abbey National's retail operations are going to have to pedal hard in 1992 if the bank's soothing aura of success is to be maintained.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Qiu Qi: "Official Calls For More Light Industry </F> Exports"]    [Text] China's light industry should boost exports and  attract more foreign capital, technology and talented people  during 1994.    Exports should increase by 15 per cent, according to  projections unveiled yesterday by Yu Zhen, Chairwoman of the  China National Light Industry Council, at a national working  conference in Shenzhen.    Yu told the conference that China's expected re-entry into  the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) will present  both opportunities and challenges for the country's light  industry.    The chairwoman called for exports of light industrial  products to reach $34.5 billion in 1994, a 15 per cent hike over  last year. The industry's exports in 1993 are estimated at $30  billion, a 15 per cent increase over the previous year.    Yu also urged her colleagues to strive for 15 per cent  growth  in light industrial output value this year. Her goal is to top  506 billion yuan ($58.16 billion), compared with 43 billion yuan  ($50 billion) in 1993.    "Quality is the key to establish the reputation of China's  light industry in both domestic and world markets," Yu said.    She vowed that more than 90 per cent of durable goods would  meet international standards.    Yu also predicted that light industry would develop more  than  800 kinds of new products.    Light industry is one of China's pillar industries. Its  output currently generates a third of the country's total  industrial output, and its export value accounts for another  third of the nation's total.    The products from light industry cover 44 sectors, including  processed foods, beverages, detergents, electronic appliances,  bicycles, watches, paper and decorative materials.    China has become the world's leading producer of more than  10  products including bicycles, china, watches, washing machines,  beer and refrigerators, Yu noted.    She said light industry will continue to transfer the  management system of enterprises to a more flexible one.    She said 31 light industry enterprises are now listed on the  Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges and more enterprises will  soon be listed.    Yu forecast that light industry would reduce debt-plagued  enterprises by five per cent this year.    She said low profits are a main problem of China's light  industry. Last year, the number of money losing enterprises  increased by more than 20 per cent over the previous year.  Their losses jumped by the same percentage.    Yu said during 1994 light industry will focus on the  co-operation in key sectors with more of the world's major  companies.    Yu said 1994 looks to he a promising year for China's  economy. Its growth will help light industry's rapid development.    Economists predict the gross national product (GNP) will  increase by 9 per cent in 1994 with a 15 per cent rise in the  light industry products sector.    During the year, the retail value of consumption products  will jump 19 per cent and the export value is expected to climb  a solid 10 per cent.    Products generated by light industry will see a steadily  growing market this year, Yu predicted.</p>

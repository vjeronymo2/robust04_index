			<p><P> September 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IS THAT ALL THE THANKS TODD CHRISTENSEN GETS?  </P> <P> Todd Christensen was a mainstay of the Raiders for years. The man deserves a  decent "thank you," not a kick in the rear. The Raiders ought to have a  conscience. They need those Oakland Raiders for the spirit of the team.  </P> <P> LAURIE KALLEN, Tarzana  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 23, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AGENTS FIND FRAUD RING AT CREDIT BUREAU;  </P> <P> CRIME: SOURCES SAY AN EMPLOYEE AT THE TRW CREDIT DATA DIVISION GAVE SENSITIVE  INFORMATION TO OUTSIDERS, WHO USED IT TO OBTAIN MERCHANDISE.  </P> <P> U.S. Secret Service agents have uncovered a fraud ring that was funneling  sensitive credit information out of the TRW Credit Data Division, one of the  nation's largest credit bureaus, authorities said Friday.  </P> <P> The investigation, conducted with the aid of TRW security personnel, is nearly  complete, The Times has learned. Several sealed indictments have been obtained,  according to the Secret Service, which investigates credit card fraud.  </P> <P> The ring reportedly involved a TRW employee who leaked information to a group  of outsiders. They, in turn, used the information to fraudulently obtain  merchandise and for other illegal purposes.  </P> <P> The misuse of credit card numbers and other sensitive personal data stored in  TRW's massive credit record database is believed to have gone on for a year or  more at credit division headquarters in the city of Orange, sources said.  </P> <P> Secret Service and TRW officials confirmed that an investigation is under way,  but they said they could not give any details until the indictments are  unsealed. They gave no indication of when the indictments will be made public,  nor would they comment on the scope of the fraud.  </P> <P> "There are sealed indictments, but we can give no further comment," said Don  Chacos, supervisor of the Secret Service fraud squad in Los Angeles. Chacos  said the indictments are the result of a "long-term" investigation, but he  would not be more specific.  </P> <P> The TRW employee whose conduct was under investigation has been terminated,  authorities said.  </P> <P> "She was an employee at TRW but was terminated in May," TRW spokeswoman  Jennifer Sanchez replied when asked about the worker in question. "We have been  working with the Secret Service, but we can't comment on the case."  </P> <P> Sanchez said the employee was hired at TRW in 1986 and worked in the consumer  relations section, which handles consumer complaints and inquiries about credit  records. Employees in that section handle such tasks as opening and sending  mail, she said, and they have access to the millions of computerized financial  records TRW keeps on individuals.  </P> <P> Although TRW is best known for its satellites and high-technology products, its  credit division is one of the largest in the nation. The files contain the  important elements of the financial histories of millions of consumers.  </P> <P> Bankers and merchants such as car dealers and furniture store sales  representatives often purchase TRW data on prospective customers to see whether  those people pay their bills and pay them on time. That information forms the  basis for a decision whether to extend them more credit. The data includes  outstanding mortgages and loans, bankruptcies, credit card numbers and  individuals' addresses, birth dates and Social Security numbers, according to  TRW.  </P> <P> TRW and two other leading credit data banks have come under fire recently from  consumer groups and Congress for lapses in securing their information from  computer hackers, con artists and other prying outsiders.  </P> <P> TRW and other credit bureaus say they have taken steps to secure their  databases but admit that their systems are not foolproof. With that in mind,  the firms are seeking more severe federal penalties for illegal entry into  their databases.  </P> <P> Sanchez said that TRW has a series of internal protections to prevent employees  from being able to take advantage of their access to the database. The system  can, for instance, discover whether employees are trying to alter their own  records to remove negative information, she said.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Davan Maharaj contributed to this article.  </P></p>

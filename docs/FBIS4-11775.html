			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Muhammad Baqir al-Hakim, chairman of the </F> Supreme Assembly of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, in Tehran by  Zuhayr Qusaybati in London; date not given]    [Excerpts] [Qusaybati] Some opposition parties believe  that your staying in Iran and failure to move to northern Iraq  is obstructing the effort to unify the opposition.    [Al-Hakim] My staying in Iran is natural, as it (Iran) was  and continue to be a base for jihad and political action against  the regime. And it provides opportunities for contacts inside  and abroad, whether within the region or with the international  community.    It also has major scientific seminaries like the Qom  seminary  -- which provide opportunities for moves at all levels in line,  of course, with all our political and cultural moves. And I do  not believe that my moving to northern Iraq would provide a new  opportunity for the opposition, especially as I have always  believed it is necessary for me personally to remain outside the  unified opposition establishments. However, I believe in the  opposition's unity. [passage omitted]    [Qusaybati] Is your moving to northern Iraq on the cards?    [Al-Hakim] My moving to north Iraq is on the cards and  natural. I also believe that it would provide a better  opportunity to serve the aim of getting rid of the criminal  regime and achieving justice, brotherhood, and unity in Iraq.  But I do not believe that there is a need for it at the moment,  especially as general harmony and cooperation exist with the  Kurdish brothers, may God bestow success on them, and also with  the other opposition parties operating in Iraqi Kurdistan.    [Qusaybati] Do you believe the opposition can still be  unified? And what about your reservations about the Salah  al-Din conference?    [Al-Hakim] I believe that unifying the opposition in the  general sense is possible. And some steps have been achieved,  as a group of the major forces is cooperating this connection.  And efforts are still continuing to achieve the other steps.  What is easy to achieve should not be abandoned because of what  is difficult to achieve, as the Islamic jurisprudence rule says.    As for the reservations announced by the Islamic forces  about  the Salah al-Din conference, this institution has responded to  some of them and efforts are being made to surmount the others.  [passage omitted]    [Qusaybati] Some people accuse you of adhering to Iranian  policy and confirming things with it.    [Al-Hakim] That is a completely false accusation. It is a  method used by the enemies in the psychological war to achieve  political aims. This is in the knowledge that we respect the  views of the brother believers in Iran and also respect Iran's  policy. [passage omitted]    [Qusaybati] You are calling for a change of regime, but the  opposition is accused of ineffectiveness and lack of influence  inside the country.    [Al-Hakim] The Iraqi position, in particular the Islamic  opposition, has turned from an opposition of political groups  and forces into an opposition of a people fighting for the sake  of salvation. The best proof of this is the uprising of 15  Sha'ban 1411 H (March 1991) and the Iraqi people's resistance  and jihad operations, which are still continuing despite the  regime's numerous attempts to destroy the resistance, use of  heavy and deadly weapons, and numerous and huge life-destroying  schemes like draining the marshes, the economic and military  blockade, the continued large-scale sweeps in the cities, and  physical liquidations and executions.    [Qusaybati] Do you believe foreign intervention is on the  cards?    [Al-Hakim] I believe that the Iraqi people should carry out  the salvation task, and the international community should help  them to do so. Regrettably the international community still  has not responded to the appeal for help. [passage omitted]    [Qusaybati] You demanded the establishment of a "safe area"  in southern Iraq. How do you explain the West's intervention to  set up a safe area in the north and its and the United Nations'  disregard for your appeals vis-a-vis the south?    [Al-Hakim] I did not demand a safe area in the south. I  demanded protection for all the Iraqi people against heavy  weapons and annihilation operations -- that is, the annihilation  of people and life. [passage omitted]    [Qusaybati] What is the number of the men of the "Badr  Corps" belonging to the "Supreme Assembly of the Islamic  Revolution" in Iran?    [Al-Hakim] It is not right to reveal such information.    [Qusaybati] Iraqi opposition sources say that Iranian  sources have scattered the corps' men.    [Al-Hakim] That is untrue. At any rate, we have our own  means of retaining our own military forces.    [Qusaybati] What about Tehran's attempts to normalize  relations with Baghdad? Does that not worry you?    [Al-Hakim] I have said from the outset that these attempts  do not worry us, because our work is associated with the Iraqi  people as a whole, and the issue is too broad and deep to be  harmed by these relations. This is why we see the regime more  frightened than us of these relations. [sentence as published]    [Qusaybati] How do you explain President Saddam Husayn's  threat to retaliate against the extension of international  sanctions, given that a split has emerged in the Security  Council over determining an armament inspection timetable that  would help lift the oil blockade?    [Al-Hakim] Saddam is experiencing a real crisis, not only at  the economic level but also at the level of the narrow and  limited base on which he relies, which has begun to shake. This  is in addition to the popular turmoil and his inability to  control the situation except through the Army -- which poses a  real threat to his existence. This is why he is trying to  preoccupy the Army with fabricated actions. And he could commit  a crime or another foolish action for the sake of staying in  power. This is why three areas are likely to targeted: the  marshlands and the north, Kuwait, or Iran... or all of them.  And he has indeed begun his attack in the marshlands but has so  far failed to achieve his aims. And he has also begun to  provoke Iran through some limited military operations. He has  also begun to deploy troops [on the border with] the north and  Iraqi Kurdistan and Kuwait. Maybe in his view Kuwait is the  most important of the fronts in question. God knows.    As for the Security Council's split, it is the result of a  conflict of interests. And the regime has its own means of  tempting and making the interests owners' mouths water as  regards the hope of having some of the debts paid. Even though  the regime has not paid its previous debts. In fact it has  increased the debts and failed to fulfill its promises and  pledges. It has actually broken them and failed to achieve  stability for the region. In fact these opportunist attitudes  have resulted in unrest and serious threats.</p>

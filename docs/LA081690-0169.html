			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> MUM'S THE WORD FROM HEAT COACH  </P> <P> Bobby Sibbald isn't talking.  </P> <P> The coach of the Los Angeles Heat lashed out at the media earlier this week and  said he will refuse to speak to reporters during the coming American  Professional Soccer League West playoffs.  </P> <P> Sibbald's actions are believed to have been triggered by:  </P> <P> * Recent reports that he has missed practices due to commitments with his  full-time job as a salesman for a hair products company.  </P> <P> * A Times reporter's interpretation of what appeared to be a shoving match  between Sibbald and a player who was cut soon after the incident.  </P> <P> * A report in The Times that team President John Ajemian has announced that the  Heat will leave the South Bay to play in Orange County in 1991.  </P> <P> Sibbald, calling the reports negative publicity, questioned the intentions of  the Times reporter, who is also a youth soccer coach.  </P> <P> "I don't see how you can say you like soccer when you write negative things  (about it)," he said.  </P> <P> When asked if his blackout was directed at a specific news outlet, Sibbald  responded: "I'm not talking to anyone."  </P> <P> Sibbald deferred comments to Heat General Manager Jill Fracisco, assistant  coach John Britton or the players.  </P> <P> Said Fracisco: "Bobby is an Englishman. He is very superstitious, maybe because  of his background in the sport (as a professional player in England and the  United States). He's gearing up for the playoffs. That's the way he gets before  a big game. And he is very closed-door. He keeps more to himself."  </P> <P> Sibbald's outburst comes at time when the second-place Heat appears to have  shaken out of its season-long malaise and is beginning to live up to billing as  the most talented team in the APSL West.PAUL McCLOUD  </P></p>

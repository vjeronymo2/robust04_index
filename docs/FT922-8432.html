			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Major seeks to reassure MPs over Queen's address MR JOHN MAJOR sought to reassure Conservative MPs yesterday that the sovereignty of the House of Commons was not under threat after the Queen delivered a historic address to the European Parliament in Strasbourg. Amid recrimination in Whitehall about the official briefing which sparked a political row over her first visit to the parliament, the Queen delivered a carefully measured address emphasising the enthusiasm for, and the limitations of, Britain's role in the Community. Mr Major told MPs that the sovereignty of the Commons 'is not a matter that is up for grabs'. He tried to assuage the fears of Tory Euro-sceptics by stressing the importance of 'subsidiarity' - by which decisions would be taken at the lowest appropriate level. 'Decisions do need to be taken as close to the citizen as possible. That was the principle we fought for and obtained in negotiations at Maastricht,' he said. Although ministers believed they had quelled the row over the Queen's speech, some Euro-sceptic MPs continued to attack the content of her address. Eighteen Tory MPs, in an as yet unnamed anti-Maastricht grouping, met last night to discuss not only the prospect of voting against the bill in principle, but also possible amendments to the legislation ratifying the Maastricht treaty. The rebels are confident they will gain the backing of colleagues during debate of the bill which begins next week. Downing Street yesterday blamed a misleading briefing on Monday from the Foreign Office for provoking protest from Tory MPs. Mr Major was angry at the reaction it had received. In a thinly-disguised reprimand, a senior Downing Street official said the Foreign Office had 'conflated' two sentences which, when set in context, had a different meaning. The early Foreign Office summary said the Queen would speak of 'differences of national parliamentary tradition insignificant against the background of European commitment to reconciliation and democracy'. Her actual words to members of the European Parliament, in a passage described by Downing Street as a 'lighter moment' in her speech, were: 'The British members will no doubt have brought to the deliberations of this house the vigorous tone of Westminster debate: a style which can be confrontational, as some of my ancestors found. 'But differences of style and opinion are insignificant against the background of the proven commitment of Europeans today to reconciliation and democracy.' However, Mr Michael Spicer, Conservative MP for South Worcestershire and a Euro-sceptic, said his worries were more than 'just a matter of comparing different styles of debates between the parliaments'. His comments presaged what is set to be a controversial intervention by Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the former prime minister, on Friday. In a speech in The Hague, she is expected to make a fresh attack on Federalism. In her speech, the Queen stuck to the government's stance on Europe. She spoke of the EC's founders not envisaging, 'a comfortable club with closed doors, but a community of challenge, where members were exposed to different points of view'. Other countries in Europe were 'knocking on the door' of the EC, the Queen said. She told MEPs that they were 'part of an effort which is unique in the world's history. 'Decisions need to be taken as close to the citizen as is compatible with their success. But at the same time we have to strengthen the ability of Europeans to act on a European basis where the nature of a problem requires a European response. That was the balance struck at Maastricht.'

			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Management: A clean break with tradition - There has been a revolution at Elida Gibbs - from the factory floor to the sales team IN A business where brands are a company's most cherished assets, abolishing the post of brand manager may not seem a brilliant idea. Yet last October, Elida Gibbs, the UK personal products subsidiary of the Anglo-Dutch Unilever group, did just that. For good measure, it scrapped its sales department, too. Instead, the company's brands - which include Faberge Brut, Pears, Signal and Timotei - are now the responsibility of a new breed of executives known as brand development managers, while the former sales team has been re-born as the 'customer development process'. The title changes are far more than cosmetic. Behind them lies a drive to shake up traditional methods which has radically transformed the way Elida Gibbs operates, from research laboratory to supermarket shelf. It is, in effect though not in name, a thorough 're-engineering' exercise. Tony Burgmans, director of Unilever's worldwide personal products business, compares the upheaval with the recent revolution in organisation and working practices which Japanese competition has forced on western industries such as cars. In common with many manufacturers in those sectors, Elida Gibbs has eagerly embraced concepts such as teamwork, empowerment and total quality. But unlike them, it has been unable to find inspiration from other companies in the same business. The experience has turned it into a testbed for new techniques within the Unilever group. The most potent external force for change was not competition from Japan, but pressure from Britain's big retailers, through which most of Elida Gibbs' products are sold. By the late 1980s, several felt the company, though still UK market leader, was failing to keep up with the times. 'Two or three years ago, Elida Gibbs' delivery standards were dire and their ordering systems archaic,' says Michael Rosen, director of non-foods at J. Sainsbury, Britain's biggest supermarket group. 'The whole thing was shambolic. They were nearing the point of losing a lot of business.' Now, he says, the company is one of Sainsbury's most efficient suppliers. The route to recovery began on the factory floor. With backing from Mike Perry, Burgmans' predecessor and now joint chairman of Unilever, Elida Gibbs introduced team-working at its plant at Seacroft, near Leeds in 1988. Responsibility for each production line has been transferred to those working on it, who are encouraged to co-operate continuously to solve problems and improve efficiency. They are also given fuller information about the company's performance and overall strategy. Initially, the switch faced scepticism from trades union officials and older middle managers. To win acceptance, the company put its 1,000 employees through three-day courses on total quality, run by teachers selected from the workforce. 'The changes would have been absolutely impossible to implement without training - it opened people's minds,' says Jon Riches, personnel director, who has overseen an increase in the company's training budget from 0.5 per cent to 1.3 per cent of sales since the late 1980s. This year, he aims to give every employee 10 days' training. The new approach has produced some big gains. In the past three years, change-over time on one production line has been reduced to less than four hours, from a day and a half, while annual lost-time accidents at Seacroft have been cut by three quarters. In parallel, a drive to improve customer service has increased from 72 per cent to more than 90 per cent the proportion of orders correctly completed. In the past year, 'right first time' performance at the plant has risen six percentage points to more than 90 per cent. The bottom line has benefited, too. Between 1989 and 1991, pre-tax profits rose by 73 per cent and margins widened from 6.5 per cent to 10 per cent. Though recession checked the improvement last year, sales grew by 9 per cent. (see table). But as experience with the new approach grew, managers became aware it needed to go still further. They realised that efforts to boost production efficiency were tackling only one link in a chain which connected every part of the business. One result was a new policy towards suppliers. In three years, their numbers have been cut by more than a third and they have been given more responsibility for quality control, testing and development. But, the biggest breakthrough has been the recognition that the traditional division of the company into separate functions, such as research or distribution, had become a serious handicap. By compartmentalising management, it was frustrating efforts to speed up innovation and increase flexibility. Last autumn, management was re-structured into teams and managers' roles re-defined on the basis of core business 'processes', such as the supply chain (manufacturing and logistics) and commercial affairs. These 'seamless teams', as Burgmans calls them, are intended to involve all parts of the business in decisions at every stage. According to Helmut Ganser, Elida Gibbs' chairman, the new brand development managers are the linchpins of the system. They are the prime movers behind product innovation and have wide authority to pull together the technical and management resources they need to see projects through. To enable them to concentrate on the longer-term business of building brands, many of the day-to-day dealings with retailers which absorbed much of the former brand managers' time have been entrusted to the customer development managers. Their priority is to satisfy growing demands from large retailers that suppliers work with them to increase the sales and profits of entire product categories, rather than just push their own brands. The teams are said already to have broken down barriers and encouraged wider participation across the company. Burgmans says group decision-making has reached the point where 'you often don't know who made a suggestion first'. In April, Elida Gibbs launched the first product of the new system. An aerosol deodorant - named Brut Aquatonic - was developed in less than six months, half as long as would have been needed previously. Burgmans reckons the development time today could be as little as three months. But he stresses the biggest advantage of the reorganisation is that it enables the company to undertake more ambitious projects, rather than just to keep doing the same things more quickly. Top managers should get a more precise picture of how the reorganisation is working when they review it this week. But the real test of its success will lie in the market - and in the reaction of retailers. Boots, Britain's largest chemists' chain, says Elida Gibbs now takes a more co-operative attitude towards developing new product markets: 'We have a much more satisfactory dialogue than in the past. They now recognise that retailers are far closer to the consumer than they can possibly be.' Sainsbury's Michael Rosen praises Elida Gibbs for 'great strides' to improve distribution and service, but says its sales are still spread across too many brands, some of which - such as Pears - it has failed to develop fully. Ganser at least partly accepts the criticism, saying he plans to focus more support behind fewer brands in future. But the challenges go beyond the UK. As Unilever integrates its European operations, Elida Gibbs will need to work more closely with sister companies on the continent. It already has Europe-wide responsibility for developing deodorants and a growing share of production is for other European markets. Not surprisingly, Elida Gibbs' managers are keeping an open mind about the results of the reorganisation. Says Riches: 'Ask us again at the end of next year. It is still too early to say we have got it right.' Previous articles in the series have appeared on May 24, June 2, 11, 18, 24 and July 5.</p>

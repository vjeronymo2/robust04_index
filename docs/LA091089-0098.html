			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> The Little Red Riding Hood of today is a "real wimp" compared to the original  heroine of ancient folk tales on which the character is based, according to UC  Berkeley anthropologist Alan Dundes. "Male writers completely ruined the tale .  . .," said Dundes. "They made the girl a weak little thing who had to be  rescued. The original folk tale is a female story in which the mother sends the  daughter out and the little girl is triumphant." What's more, he said, she  didn't wear a hood, red or otherwise. He said the culprits who rearranged the  tale were 17th-Century French writer Charles Perrault and, later, the Grimm  brothers -- Jacob and Wilhelm.  </P></p>

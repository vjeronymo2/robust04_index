			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAISING THE IRON CURTAIN MEANS A CONTINENTAL SHIFT;  </P> <P> GEOPOLITICS: THE FOCUS OF THE CONTINENT MOVES EAST, FROM BONN TO BERLIN, FROM  BRUSSELS TO VIENNA. THE NEW EUROPE REGAINS BALANCE, RECLAIMS SOUL.  </P> <P> German reunification and the rejection of communism by the East European  countries will produce a shift of interest -- economic and political -- from  the west toward the center of Europe: from Bonn to Berlin, from Brussels to  Vienna.  </P> <P> The perception of this phenomenon is growing in Western Europe; its  repercussions could deeply change the geopolitical configuration of the  Continent.  </P> <P> From Bonn to Berlin. How can a unified Germany renounce the national, historic  role of Berlin? This question is repeated again and again, almost obsessively,  by my interlocutors in Bonn. Chancellor Konrad Adenauer chose Bonn as the  capital of the Federal Republic against the wishes of many politicians who  preferred Frankfurt. Adenauer said that the choice of a small provincial town  would better underline the provisional character of the new capital.  Provisional indeed, as the market quickly recognized: Real-estate prices have  suddenly crumbled by nearly 40% in the last weeks.  </P> <P> From Brussels to Vienna. If Bonn is unsure of its future as the  politico-administrative center of Germany, then Brussels, provisional capital  of the European Community, watches the rise of Vienna as a competitor in the  very heart of Europe.  </P> <P> Liberated from communism, Hungary and Czechoslovakia, once part of the  Austro-Hungarian Empire, look almost naturally to Vienna. Yugoslavia could  disintegrate in the near future or considerably loosen ties between the states  of the federation. In the meantime, Austria has again become the pole of  attraction for Slovenia and Croatia, as it was when Vienna was the capital of  the empire.  </P> <P> Perceiving this trend, the foreign ministers of four states of the region --  Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Yugoslavia and Italy -- have met routinely in recent  months to discuss problems specific to their area. Poland, wary of a reunited  Germany, has shown an interest in joining the initiative.  </P> <P> And Vienna -- already the seat of several important international agencies and  currently host of both the NATO-Warsaw Pact negotiations and the Helsinki  accords talks -- is also a candidate for hosting the organization that will  verify compliance of arms-reduction treaties.  </P> <P> In time, the European Community might find that its Brussels base is so near  the English Channel and so far from the center that at least some of its  institutions should move eastward.  </P> <P> All of this, of course, presupposes a Europe not haunted by the specter of  German reunification, nor by a fear of Germany's hegemony -- and an upsurge of  territorial claims. This supposes a Europe of political harmony, some degree of  economic integration and of resolved border anxieties and ethnic tensions. At  present no one can predict such an idyllic evolution.  </P> <P> Indeed, the immediate concern on this side of the Atlantic is for the aftermath  of today's elections in East Germany. Since reunification now seems likely to  happen sooner than anyone could have predicted, the pan-European summit planned  for later this year has been devised not to prevent the inevitable, but to slow  reunification until the elements of a new political settlement for the two  Germanys -- and simultaneously for Europe as a whole -- have been assembled.  </P> <P> The trend is to favor a pan-European solution for the problems created by the  collapse of the communist regimes. If the biggest of these problems -- the  surprisingly quick pace of Germany's reunification -- can be solved in a  pan-European framework, the Continent will regain its geographical balance,  long subverted by the Iron Curtain. It would gravitate more toward the center,  to the heart of Europe, thus repairing half a century's distortion.  </P> <P> Two generations of Europeans, brought up in two antagonistic parts of our  Continent, have faint knowledge of a formidable patrimony the intelligentsia of  Prague, Budapest, Warsaw and Moscow contributed to Europe. The Russian writers,  from Turgenev to Pushkin to Dostoevski, interpreted the desires, the anxieties,  the deep sense of the infinite of the men and women of the entire Continent.  </P> <P> They were half of our soul.  </P> <P> We might recover it.  </P></p>

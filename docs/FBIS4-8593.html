			<p>BFN     [Text] Klaus Kinkel, vice chancellor and foreign minister  of Germany, arrived in Bulgaria on an official visit last night.    After official talks at the Foreign Ministry this morning,  Kinkel will pay a call on National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur  Yordanov and have meetings at the Council of Ministers. This  afternoon he will be received by President Zhelyu Zhelev.    Upon his arrival, the German foreign minister particularly  stressed that there are no problems in the relations between  Bulgaria and Germany. Regarding the international topics to be  discussed in his talks, he said that he would certainly be  discussing the situation in former Yugoslavia and the Balkans as  a whole. In addition, the situation in Russia would not be  omitted in the talks. Kinkel supposed that other subjects would  crop up in the course of the talks that would prevent them from  becoming tedious. Perhaps one of the reasons is this:    [Begin Kinkel recording, in German fading into Bulgarian  report] Bulgaria lies very close to my heart, Mr. Kinkel said.  He added that he will try to help Bulgaria in solving its  problems, both in terms of joining the EU and in connection with  its contacts with NATO and its relations with the IMF. I am  sure that Bulgaria can count on the German foreign minister,  Kinkel declared on his arrival at Sofia Airport. [end recording]</p>

			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Letter: Verdict on NHS reforms should reflect impact on patients Sir, I was interested to read John Willman's review of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development report, The Reform of Healthcare ('Just what the doctor ordered', March 1). As Mr Willman rightly points out, the OECD can draw no final conclusions on the changes that have been brought either in Britain or the Netherlands. Nevertheless, it is pertinent to ask the question as to how any final conclusions will be drawn. Who are the changes expected to have benefited? Is it - as the cutting of costs indicates - governments and the Treasury which are to benefit? Or is it - as any sensible person would expect - the patients who are supposed to be the beneficiaries? These are crucial questions when National Health Service changes have resulted in rocketing waiting lists and a two-tier health service, with GP fundholders obtaining minor treatment for their patients while serious surgery is delayed for many others. This situation has forced the secretary of state for health to admit, as she did last Friday, that the internal market has led to delays in urgent treatment, as hospitals simply run out of money. I hope that the OECD will now connect up with those receiving health treatment so that further reports will make a judgment on outcomes and not merely inputs into the system. David Blunkett MP, shadow secretary of state for health, House of Commons, London SW1 0AA</p>

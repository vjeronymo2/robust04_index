			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hopes of early rate cut help to lift Nikkei HOPES of cut in the discount rate and buying by public funds and investment trusts helped the Nikkei average to post a moderate gain, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average closed up 124.37 to 17,406.22. The index fell to the day's low of 17,325.88 just after the opening, but rose to a high of 17,498.40 as a higher futures market prompted arbitrage-buying by dealers. Some earlier gains were eroded by afternoon profit-taking. Volume rose to 240m shares from 189m as public funds, investment trusts, and corporations bought shares for their employee stock ownership schemes. Advances led declines by 676 to 250 with 189 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 8.06 to 1,312.92 and in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.26 to 1,062.42. Some investors were encouraged by mounting expectations of a cut in the official discount rate as Sakura Bank, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Fuji Bank and Sumitomo Bank followed Sanwa by cutting their short-term prime rates, the base lending rates to corporate clients. Leading investment advisory firms and life assurers were seen buying blue chip issues. Nippon Steel, the most active issue of the day, rose Y2 to Y298 and Kobe Steel, the second active, advanced Y3 to Y303. Reports that Fujitsu has developed the world's first 256 megabit dynamic random access memory chip boosted the shares by Y23 to Y556. Other high-technology issues were also higher on hopes of a US economic recovery. Toshiba rose Y5 to Y623 and NEC gained Y11 to Y680. Banks were higher on hopes of larger profit margins due to lower interest rates. Industrial Bank of Japan rose Y10 to Y2,470 and Sakura Bank gained Y20 to Y1,140. Housing and real estate companies were firm on reports of brisk condominium sales. Daikyo gained Y52 to Y822 and Mitsui Fudosan rose Y31 to Y993. Some speculative theme stocks fell on profit-taking by dealers. Mitsui Mining and Smelting fell Y4 to Y485 and Meiji Milk Products lost Y1 to Y928. In Osaka, the OSE average gained 168.51 to 18,854.51 in volume of 33.7m shares, as dealers supported issues with positive earnings prospects. Roundup HONG KONG advanced strongly for the second consecutive day while other markets in the region were mixed. Bombay remained closed as violence continued to spread through the country. HONG KONG responded positively to news that Tuesday's Sino-British talks had gone smoothly, while unsubstantiated rumours that Governor Chris Patten might soften his democratic reform proposals gave an additional boost to the market late in the day. The Hang Seng index closed up 136.98 or 2.6 per cent at 5,339.25 n turnover of HKDollars 2.25bn. HSBC Holdings rose HKDollars 2 to HKDollars 56. SINGAPORE rebounded with a 12.71 gain in the Straits Times industrial index to 1,446.74.

Medicine and construction companies went against the trend on forecasts of higher earnings this year. Hyundai Pharmaceutical rose Won600 to Won14,000 and Chong Kun Dang gained Won500 to Won25,500. MANILA fell back on fears that legislation limiting the payment of the country's foreign debt might be approved by Congress. The composite index slid 12.76 to 1,265.96 in combined turnover of 160m pesos. Among major issues, Philippine National Bank lost 9 pesos to 211 pesos and Manila Electric A shares eased 4 pesos to 157 pesos. KUALA LUMPUR declined on profit-taking with the composite index losing 2.41 to 633.52 in turnover of some MDollars 212m, while TAIWAN advanced on institutional buying, the weighted index improving 15.54 to 3,776.55 in turnover of TDollars 13.6bn.

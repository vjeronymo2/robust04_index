			<p>BFN     [Text] Voting in the Lukasha constituency by-elections  started at (?a) low key this morning, with some polling stations  recording as few 38 voters by midday. A ZANA survey revealed  that (Chikambi) had the highest number of voters by noon, having  a relatively good turnout at 69 votes out of 1,664 registered  voters.    Presiding officers in most polling stations visited  attributed the low turnout to people's preference to cultivate  their gardens in the morning, but that the situation could  change by late in the afternoon. There was also the problem of  people present outdated voters' cards or [words indistinct]  cards of the late 1980's.    Voting in the Mufulira constituency by-elections started on  a  very poor note, with some polling stations recording as few as  10 voters by mid-morning today. The voting, which started at  0600 has been characterized by apathy, as a snap survey carried  out by the Zambia News Agency shows, most polling stations  visited recorded below 30 voters by 1100.    At (Antanshe) Primary School in Kamuchanga, only 39 voters  had cast their votes by 1050, out of a total of 1,032 registered  voters.    In Kahoma East and Kansuswa the presiding officers, who did  not want to be named, said the turnout was very poor. In  Kamuchanga, the situation was not different from Kahoma and  Kansuswa where, by 0900, only about eight people had cast their  votes. At Kachironda, the turnout was (?a bit) [words  indistinct] the presiding officers said the turnout was good so  he could not [words indistinct] actual figures of people who had  voted.    Meanwhile, voting in the Chinsali by-elections went on  (?fitfully) at a number of polling stations visited by ZNBC  [Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation].

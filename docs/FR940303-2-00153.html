			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NYSE has been careful in formulating the Information Memo to prohibit only those transactions that would abuse the odd-lot limit order execution guarantees. For example, the Information Memo does not preclude market participants from entering odd-lot market orders for index arbitrage, program trading, or day trading. Because the Commission believes the proposal clearly identifies and prohibits certain strategies that can result in abuse of the NYSE's odd-lot limit order system, yet still allows market participants to have such orders executed by entering odd-lot market orders rather than limit orders, the Commission believes that the proposal will not unfairly limit access to the NYSE's market. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission finds good cause for accelerated approval of Amendment No. 2 to the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after publication of notice of filing thereof. Amendment No. 2 modifies the proposal to make certain technical and clarifying adjustments to the proposed rule change but leaves the overall structure and purpose of the proposal unchanged. We also note that no comments were received on the proposal as noticed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements of sections 11A <FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>  and 6(b). <FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>  In particular, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the section 11A(a)(1)(C)(i) mandate that it is in the public interest and appropriate for the protection of investors and the maintenance of fair and orderly markets to assure economically efficient execution of securities transactions. The Commission further believes the proposal is consistent with the section 6(b)(5) requirements that the rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts, and, in general, to protect investors and the public, in that the proposal will ensure the continued pricing and execution efficiencies provided by the NYSE's odd-lot order system by identifying and prohibiting certain odd-lot limit order trading strategies that are not consistent with traditional odd-lot transactions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 14&blank;15 U.S.C. 78k&hyph;1 (1988) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15&blank;15 U.S.C. 78f(b) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, June 11 -- The presidium of the Sejm Defence  Committee in a statement made public Saturday charged spokesman  for the Defence Ministry Wieslaw Rozbicki with incompetence,  disrespect for civilian politicians and lack of understanding of  the fundamental principle of full control of the state  authorities over the Armed Forces. The statement came as a  response to an article published by Rozbicki in the Thursday  issue of the "GAZETA WYBORCZA" daily.    The deputies are expecting an explanation from the defence  minister whether the contents of the article is compatible with  a respective official stand of the ministry.    The Defence Committee's presidium stated that it is highly  inappropriate that the official spokesman for the ministry put  in doubt the advisability of Poland having signed international  disarmament agreements. According to the presidium, the  suggestion that these agreements should be renegotiated is  inconsistent with the official position of the Polish Government.    Authors of the statement recalled also that the disarmament  agreements had been signed at the time when the present Defence  Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk had been serving his first term in  office. in the opinion of the deputies, the suggestion that in  result of these agreements poland has diminished the combat  readiness of its army in comparison with its neighbours is  completely false and attests to the spokesman's incompetence.  The deputies expect the defence minister to address the issue.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Guiyang, April 13 (XINHUA) -- An "aid-the-poor"  campaign is off to a good start in southwest China's Guizhou  Province.    In Guizhou there are more than 10 million people living  below  the poverty line, one-eighth of the country's total of such  people.    This month the first batch of over 410,000 donated items,  worth four million yuan, have been sent to two poverty-stricken  areas with an annual per capita income below 200 yuan and over  three million people living in dire poverty.    Minority nationalities, including the Miao, Bouyi and Yao,  account for over 90 percent of the population in the mountainous  areas of Guizhou.    The drive is being headed by Governor Chen Shineng and  Secretary of the Provincial Communist Party Committee Liu  Fangren.    According to a local official, individuals and more than 100  enterprises based in cities in Guizhou have contributed money or  articles to the poor.</p>

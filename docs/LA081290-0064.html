			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLATFORM;  </P> <P> BLESS AMERICA  </P> <P> I am not (optimistic that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein will withdraw from  Kuwait). The occupation is totally unacceptable. It's an aggression -- brutal  aggression -- and it has to be stopped.  </P> <P> Kuwait is a very rich country, a very helpless country. Therefore, it does  require outside protection. However, outside protection is not always easy to  swallow, because that means outside intervention. And it's not the easiest  thing to accept other forces in your land, on your border -- even if it's for  your own protection. So it's really a Catch-22 kind of game. You have to do  something, but you don't know exactly what to do because in this matter, there  is no appropriate thing to do. Everybody is hoping for protection; everybody is  seeking protection.  </P> <P> Indirectly, everybody is blessing the American decision to interfere, even  though down deep inside, we wish we never had to.  </P> <P> I hope to see Iraqi troops withdrawing from Kuwait very soon and normal life  restored, without a need for any kind of wars.  </P></p>

Armando Rodriguez Lozano, secretary of the PRI electoral  campaign, ruled out the possibility there might be any change in  the presidential nomination of Luis Donaldo Colosio. Rodriguez  Lozano added that this has been the product of speculation by  journalists.    [Begin Rodriguez Lozano] With all due respect, you newsmen  [words indistinct]. In all sincerity, within the party there are  no doubts about our candidate. I firmly state this. Anything  else is absurd. [end recording]</p>

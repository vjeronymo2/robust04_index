			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Powering to profit - The Week Ahead Seven of the 12 regional electricity companies report their results next week, beginning with Norweb and Seeboard on Monday. The seven will not want to increase their profits by a much larger percentage than the 15 to 20 per cent announced already by the rest of the pack. Doing so would attract unwelcome attention from consumers and the regulator just ahead of the most important review of prices they are likely to face. Norweb is expected to announce pre-tax profits of about Pounds 175m, against Pounds 157m, and a dividend of about 22.5p, up from 20p. Seeboard is predicted to announce Pounds 125m (Pounds 113m) pre-tax and an 11.6p (10p) dividend. On Tuesday, Midlands is likely to announce about Pounds 200m pre-tax (Pounds 167m) and a 23p (20p) dividend. On Wednesday, Northern should announce about Pounds 125m (Pounds 111m) and 24.6p (21.4p) and Eastern about Pounds 220m (Pounds 183m) and 22p (19.2p). On Thursday, SWEB should achieve Pounds 115m (Pounds 101m) and 23.3p (20p). Yorkshire will bring the show to a close on Friday with about Pounds 175m (Pounds 156m) and 23.5p (20.4p). Airtours, the tour group, is due to report first-half results on Monday, with pre-tax losses expected to be about Pounds 18m after a profit of Pounds 3.5m from disposal of fixed assets. This compares with Pounds 6.9m last time before the expenses of Airtours' failed bid for its rival, Owners Abroad. The loss will occasion no surprise; travel companies usually make first-half losses. Nor will the size of the loss be unexpected; Airtours said this would not exceed Pounds 18m when it launched a rights issue in April. BPB Industries, Europe's biggest plasterboard maker, has seen a sharp rise in margins since a price war between it and two Continental companies - Lafarge Coppee of France and Knauf of Germany - ended more than 18 months ago. Pre-tax profits of about Pounds 100m are expected for the year to the end of March when BPB announces its annual results on Thursday. This compares with Pounds 57.5m the previous year, but is still well short of the peak of more than Pounds 200m earned five years ago. Asda, the supermarket group, reports its full-year results on Thursday and is expected to post pre-tax profits of around Pounds 190m, little changed from the Pounds 187.4m reported the previous year which included exceptional credits of Pounds 65.2m. Vendome, the Pounds 3bn luxury goods group spun off from the restructuring of Rothmans last October, is expected on Friday to report profits of at least Pounds 205m for the year to end-March - ahead of a pro forma Pounds 187.8m. The group, which numbers Cartier and Dunhill among its brands, will also be reporting exceptional charges of more than Pounds 20m, mostly made up of restructuring costs.</p>

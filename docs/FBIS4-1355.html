The order, according to the  papers, came as the nation continues to witness fuel crisis  which is almost grinding the economy to a halt. The papers say  that the directive, which was issued by the office of the chief  of general staff, warned that drastic measures would be taken by  the government to deal with the situation if the NNPC fails to  do so. The story attracted different headlines: NNPC Gets  Ultimatum, DAILY CHAMPION; NNPC On The Fire Over Fuel Supply,  DAILY TIMES; NNPC Gets Government Ultimatum To Ease Fuel Crisis,  THE GUARDIAN.</p>

			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Tear-gas attack on Phola Park squatters' camp Residents of Phola Park squatters' camp near Johannesburg try to escape yesterday from a tear-gas attack during a police and military raid on the camp, an area of continuing factional violence. The latest turmoil came as Amnesty International, the international human rights organisation, warned that talks on South Africa's future were taking place 'against a background of increasing political violence and terror in the black townships, squatter camps and on commuter trains.' Amnesty also says the South African government has not taken firm enough action to end involvement by the security forces in torture and political killings. Unless they are brought to justice, 'the current climate of fear and high loss of life will continue, threatening prospects for a democratic transition in South Africa.' Amnesty notes that 'not a single prosecution has yet resulted' from any official inquiries into police and military complicity in assassinations of black activists.</p>

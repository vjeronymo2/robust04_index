			<p><P> November 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TELEVISION REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'AIDS QUARTERLY' PROBES DEPTH OF POLAND'S HEALTH DILEMMA  </P> <P> Perhaps the most nettlesome aspects of the global spread of AIDS are its  glacial pace and how it hits hardest those poor countries whose health care  systems are least able to contend with it.  </P> <P> No sooner has the confetti settled from European celebrations of a unified,  liberated Continent than we see such reports as the latest edition of "The AIDS  Quarterly," tonight at 8 on Channel 15 and at 10 on Channel 28.  </P> <P> The edition's main segment (followed by a brief one on HIV-infected author  Edmund White) examines why Poland has become a nightmarishly perfect host for  AIDS.  </P> <P> Consider the elements that make Poland a virtual AIDS sponge. Its deep Catholic  traditions frown on the talk or use of condoms, and frown even more on gay men  coming out of the closet. A cheap, homemade type of heroin called Kompot has  caused a 400% increase in addicts in a decade, with numbers now reaching some  600,000 Poles. Since needles are scarce and usually shared, most Kompot users  are now HIV-positive.  </P> <P> The final insult is Poland's health-care apparatus: Warsaw's only  infectious-diseases hospital can handle no more than eight AIDS patients at  once -- and they are treated with medicine past its expiration date. As Dr.  Andrej Horban states: "This is the dilemma of the poor man."  </P> <P> The depth of the dilemma, though, is somewhat blunted by the report's rather  numb approach, broken by moments of chilling displays of intolerance (a woman  berates a homeless drug addict on the street) or hopelessness (a young couple,  both infected, wait to die).

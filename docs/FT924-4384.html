			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow rally starts to run out of steam Wall Street AFTER registering strong gains in the four previous days, the rally in US share prices showed signs of running out of steam yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 10.80 at 3,295.36, having spent all but a few minutes of the day in negative territory. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished down 0.62 at 430.73, while the Amex composite ended 2.14 lower at 392.97 and the Nasdaq composite up 1.22 at 653.95, another record close. Turnover on the NYSE remained heavy at 259m shares, while rises and declines were neck and neck at 912 and 914, respectively. A combination of weakness on overseas markets and profit-taking in the wake of recent gains prompted the early selling. Positive economic news at home, however, helped prices stage a modest rally later, although it proved short-lived and selling again took hold in mid-afternoon. A 0.4 per cent rise in the October index of leading economic indicators, and the National Association of Purchasing Management's November index, which climbed from 50.6 in October to 55.0, was the latest more proof that the economy is recovering. Among individual stocks, Digital Equipment, which enjoyed big gains during Monday's sector-wide rally, dropped Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 32 7/8 in turnover of 2.3m shares amid rumours of a development problem with the company's Alpha technology which is at the heart of a future product strategy. Digital denied that it was experiencing any such problems with Alpha. Unisys climbed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 9 3/4 in turnover of 3.1m shares after broking house Josephthal Lyon &amp; Ross upgraded the stock from a 'hold' to a 'buy'. Profit-taking left IBM Dollars  1/2 lower at Dollars 67 3/4 , and Hewlett-Packard down Dollars 2 3/8 at Dollars 64 1/8 . Chemical stocks were in demand, with Du Pont rising Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 49 1/4 , Dow Chemical putting on Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 54 7/8 . Monsanto, which rose early on, ended unchanged at Dollars 56 1/8 . LSI Logic rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 10 in busy trading after the company cancelled the three-day shutdown that it had planned for later this month and said it expected to achieve 'solid profitability' in the fourth quarter. Baker Hughes dropped Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 18 3/8 in turnover of 2.1m shares after warning that first-quarter net income would come in below market forecasts of 19 cents a share. The group did say, however, that profits in the remaining three quarters would be better than in the same period of 1992. Canada TORONTO stocks finished lower after a heavy trading session with most indices losing ground. The TSE 300 slipped 9.2 to 3273.7 on 36m shares valued at CDollars 352.9m.</p>

			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Brussels clears aid for Aer Lingus The European Commission yesterday authorised a IPounds 175m (Pounds 168m) equity injection by the Irish government into Aer Lingus, its troubled state airline, as part of a big restructuring package to return it to commercial viability. However, the Commission has attached strict conditions over the use of the aid 'to avoid any effects which could be contrary to the common interest'. These include: Aer Lingus must not expand its operating fleet during the two-year restructuring plan. Aer Lingus' European operations, transatlantic operations and a proposed 'low-cost, no-frills' operation known as Aer Lingus Express - planned for the Dublin-London route - will be operated as separate legal entities with separate accounts. Aer Lingus Express must only use existing aircraft in its fleet if established during the restructuring period. No additional seating capacity will be placed on its Ireland-UK routes during the restructuring programme. The equity is to be used only for restructuring and not for acquiring shareholdings in any Community carrier. No further grant aid is to be given to Aer Lingus. Sir Michael Bishop, the chairman of British Midland, Aer Lingus' main competitor on the busy Dublin-Heathrow route, yesterday welcomed 'the strong and meaningful conditions imposed by the Commission' and called it a 'landmark decision in staunching the unconditional flow of money into loss-making European state-owned airlines by national governments'. But he warned that if it transpires that the aid is used other than solely for restructuring 'we will consider legal action'. He said that concerns expressed by Aer Lingus' competitors over the danger of cross-subsidising of 'uneconomic fares' by Aer Lingus on the Dublin-London route 'appears to have been ignored by today's ruling'. Aer Lingus, which has debts of IPounds 550m, yesterday welcomed the Commission decision. It said the restrictions on the aid would affect its ability to compete and that it expected to return to 'modest profitability' in 1994-95. The equity is to be paid in three tranches. The first of IPounds 75m will be made before the end of the year; IPounds 56m of this is to be used to finance redundancies, the remainder to reduce debt. The two other tranches of IPounds 50m each will also be used for debt reduction and will be made in 1994 and 1995.</p>

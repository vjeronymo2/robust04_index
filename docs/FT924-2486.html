			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Swiss try to keep options open on Euro integration SWITZERLAND'S economy minister, Mr Jean-Pascal Delamuraz, said yesterday his government would not withdraw its application to join the European Community. This is in spite of last Sunday's vote rejecting Swiss membership of the European Economic Area, which extends the EC's single market to members of the European Free Trade Association. Mr Delamuraz, a fervent pro-European, said the government had a duty to keep Switzerland's options open, even though EC membership was not a question of next year or the year after. He was speaking after an Efta ministerial meeting he described as one of 'shame' for Switzerland, a founder member. The country renounced its turn to the rotating presidency for the next half-year, when the EEA will be the main focus of Efta activity, and was barred from taking part in the discussions on the EEA's future. Ministers from the other six Efta countries urged rapid entry into force of the EEA, now delayed beyond its planned starting date of January 1993. Their communique called for a diplomatic conference with the EC to be held in January to approve 'technical adaptations' to the EEA accord, enabling it to enter into force 'at the earliest possible date in the first half of 1993'. 'We hope there will be no renegotiation of the EEA,' said Mr Bjorn Tore Godal, Norway's trade minister, who chaired the two-day meeting. The main stumbling block concerns the fund Efta members agreed to set up to aid poorer EC regions, worth Ecu2bn (Pounds 1.57bn) over five years, to which Switzerland was due to contribute 27 per cent. The remaining six - Austria, Finland, Iceland, Liechtenstein (which votes on the EEA tomorrow), Norway and Sweden - will ask the EC to accept a simple deduction of the Swiss contribution. But Spain has said other Efta members should make up the difference. If Liechtenstein accepts the treaty, it will somehow have to square its EEA membership with its customs and currency union with Switzerland. Other Europeans might worry that Liechtenstein would become Switzerland's furtive path for gaining EEA advantages without joining. Normally, Liechtensteiners would follow the Swiss. But the reigning prince, Hans-Adam II, has campaigned hard for the EEA, even threatening to dissolve parliament in October if it would not schedule Liechtenstein's referendum before the Swiss one. The prince now looks clever to have given way. The Swiss have been so torn by remorse since their rejection of the EEA that wavering Liechtensteiners may tip the result in favour.</p>

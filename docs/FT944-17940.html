			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Kremlin impotent over large-scale managerial fraud The Russian government yesterday heard a detailed report on systematic theft of property by Russia's top managers - in the face of which senior ministers confessed their impotence. This 'managerial looting' - now running at tens of trillions of roubles - is allegedly hugely increasing the load of debt owed to private and government enterprises. Mr Sergei Belayev, the director of the Federal Bankruptcy Agency, told the committee on inter-enterprise debt chaired by Mr Oleg Soskovets, the first deputy prime minister, that corrupt contracts had meant the delivery of materials for which no money was officially paid for months or even years - though it could be assumed that money changed hands unofficially. Meanwhile, the cost of the products appeared on the company books as debt, and the managers appealed to the government for subsidies and delayed paying their workers wages. Mr Belayev, whose agency investigates the ability of Russian enterprises to pay their bills and who has compiled a dossier on the activities of Russia's companies, said 'this is typical of much of Russian industry and is doing large-scale damage to the Russian economy. They (the managers) are exporting the working capital of the country.' Mr Soskovets said he would recommend a presidential decree controlling the actions of enterprise managers and establishing permanent financial control over the larger debtors. However, Mr Gennady Melikyan, labour minister, said the managers most at fault 'are probably too smart to be caught' and that 'it is clear they are getting fat on this, but what can we do?' Mr Belayev used the instance of the Norsi oil refinery in Nizhny Novgorod as an example of management actions. The refinery had been declared unable to pay its debts of more than Rbs1,000bn, but in fact, said Mr Belayev, it had substantial assets and earning power. In association with the 'Roman Invest' trading company in St Petersburg, the refinery had shipped a significant part of its output without any payment at all for a year. Inflation had reduced the value of the money eventually received. In the course of 1993, the value of products involved was Rbs12bn. When officials from Rosneft, the Russian oil holding company, attempted to collect its 38 per cent of shares in Norsi in order to exercise control over its operations, they were barred from entering the plant. Ministers at the meeting said that Rosneft's acquiescence in this prohibition represented a 'complete abdication or responsibility'. Mr Vladimir Gusev, head of the state taxation service, said 'everyone has known about this for a long time'.</p>

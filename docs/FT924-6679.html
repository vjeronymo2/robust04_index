			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / Yeltsin halts North Korean military aid MR Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, seeking to cement ties with South Korea, said yesterday his country was suspending military aid to North Korea. In a speech to the South Korean parliament, he also said that Russia could stop building submarines, a key component of its naval arsenal, within the next three years. He said Moscow would sharply cut its armed forces in the Far East to help contribute to better relations. 'I think that in two or three years' time we will stop making submarines for military purposes,' he said, departing from the text of his prepared speech to parliament. He also hinted broadly Russia would consider selling weapons to South Korea. Mr Yeltsin, on his first official trip to an Asian country, is pressing hard to transform ties with a strategically vital region and potential source of hard currency. He tried to bury the contentious past, returning to Seoul the flight recorders from a South Korean airliner shot down by a Soviet warplane in 1983 with the loss of 269 lives. Seoul is seeking Russian help in persuading North Korea to accept nuclear inspections and renew progress toward unification. But Russia's reduced military ties and falling trade with North Korea are likely to weaken its leverage with Pyongyang. Russia has already ended the supply of nuclear materials and technology to North Korea, Mr Yeltsin told Mr Roh Tae-woo, the South Korean president. Moscow is now curtailing arms shipments to Pyongyang, including the supply of MiG-29 combat aircraft being assembled in the North. Mr Roh asked Mr Yeltsin, who will visit Beijing next month, to urge China to take a more active role in resolving the Korean question. North Korea's trade patterns last year were governed by a search for new oil supplies to compensate for falling petroleum shipments from the former Soviet Union, Kotra, the Seoul-based Korea trade promotion agency, said yesterday. Soviet oil supplies and its shipment of machinery and industrial facilities to North Korea fell last year after Moscow demanded cash payments for these goods, which were formerly settled through open account arrangements.</p>

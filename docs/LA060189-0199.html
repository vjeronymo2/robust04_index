			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> INTERIOR DROPS 'LET IT BURN' GUIDELINE  </P> <P> The Interior Department ordered a strict fire-control plan for national parks  and wilderness areas today, at least temporarily abandoning the "let it burn"  philosophy that allowed fires to devastate thousands of acres in Yellowstone  National Park last summer.  </P> <P> The joint directive, embracing a task force report, was issued by Interior  Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. and Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter, whose  department has jurisdiction over national forests.  </P> <P> The task force, which was called to review federal fire management policies  after last summer's fires at Yellowstone, concluded that there are  environmental benefits to allowing controlled fires, but that greater  assurances must be shown that a fire cannot get out of control before it is  allowed to burn.  </P></p>

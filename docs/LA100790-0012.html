			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> GALLERIES;  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IMPRESSIONISTS  </P> <P> THE CLARITY AND FORCE of Southern California's ambient light -- as well as our  Mediterranean climate and gorgeous natural landscape -- lured artists here in  droves at the turn of the century.  </P> <P> Often compared to French painters of the time, these California Impressionists  hailed from the eastern United States and Europe; 75 of their soft and silken  plein-air paintings, by nine artists, compose "California Light, 1900-1930," on  display Oct. 12 through Jan. 6 at the Laguna Art Museum. The works pay tribute  to the beauty and brilliance that was Southern California during an earlier,  more tranquil time.  </P> <P>  Laguna Art Museum, 307 Cliff Drive, Laguna Beach; (714) 494-6531.  </P></p>

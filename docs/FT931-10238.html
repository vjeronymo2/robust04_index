			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Weak property market wipes out growth at MSC MANCHESTER SHIP Canal yesterday reported a marginal decline in pre-tax profits for 1992, down from Pounds 10.8m to Pounds 10.5m as difficult property markets wiped out growth on its port operations. Turnover rose 37 per cent to Pounds 27.7m (Pounds 20.2m) and operating profits by nearly 14 per cent to Pounds 5.97m (Pounds 5.25m), thanks to a continuing squeeze on costs. The port made profits of Pounds 6.07m, a rise of 16 per cent on turnover up 3.5 per cent at Pounds 20.9m and cargoes ahead 2.8 per cent at 7.96m tonnes. This, however, was not enough to counter falling income from property and investments, and there was an exceptional debit of Pounds 1.45m to disband the company's police force. The company's main port interests are concentrated around Ellesmere Port and Runcorn in Cheshire, while most of its property comprises the old Manchester docklands at Trafford Park and Salford Quays, where there is local oversupply of new office space. Tax took Pounds 2.05m (Pounds 2.2m credit) - because of reduced enterprise zone allowances. This caused earnings per share to fall to 219.6p (339p). The proposed single dividend is unchanged at 4.5p. Shareholders' funds improved from Pounds 137.3m to Pounds 153.1m after revaluation of dredging deposit grounds and the company's interest in a waste disposal site. Mr Robert Hough, chairman, said the property division had 'weathered the storms reasonably well'. Rental income had fallen by Pounds 700,000, but properties had been sold for Pounds 9.88m at a profit of Pounds 390,000. He believed Harbour City, the flagship development in Salford Quays, would eventually attract more tenants because of its high standard of design. He also hoped for a government decision this year on the company's Dumplington site. The 300-acre site is on the south bank of the canal at the junction of four motorways. A regional shopping centre is proposed.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 4 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists  mobilized nuclear-capable F-16 and F-15 fighter-bombers,  pursuit-assault planes, VTOL [vertical takeoff and landing]  assault planes, electronic jamming planes and early warning  planes based overseas and warplanes of the U.S. Airforce  stationed in South Korea and the South Korean puppet Airforce,  some 500 in all, in surprise air strike exercises against the  North in the skies above Yongwol, Tanyang, Umsong and Asan Bay  of South Korea on June 1 and 2, according to military sources.    Meanwhile, the South Korean puppets fired more than 500  large-calibre machinegun and automatic rifle bullets, charging  toward the Military Demarcation Line from Paju County on June 1.  Formations of helicopter gunboats and transport helicopters  staged ground-attack support and airlifting exercises in the  skies above Pochon, Yonchon and Chorwon and Inje, South Korean  Kangwon Province, on June 2.    Facts clearly show how desperately the U.S. imperialists and  the South Korean puppets are trying to increase their combat  capacity in a war against the North.</p>

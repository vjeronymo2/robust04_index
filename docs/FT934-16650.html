			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / International Company News: Aerospatiale plunges further into the red AEROSPATIALE, the French state-owned aerospace group, suffered net losses of FFr870m (Dollars 150m) in the first six months of the year, almost double the FFr477m net loss in the first half of 1992. The group, which is included on the list of 21 public companies selected for privatisation by the French government, blamed the decline on the depressed state of the international civil and military aviation markets. Aerospatiale said that a return to profits required continued restructuring and economy measures in the coming months. Sales fell by 12 per cent to FFr22.98bn for the first half of the year. Aerospatiale said it expected full-year sales to decline. The first-half performance included an exceptional charge of FFr640m resulting from the cost of provisions for the group's restructuring plan. The plan, announced at the beginning of the summer, includes the loss of 2,240 jobs by the end of next year. This exceptional loss was partly offset by an exceptional gain of FFr415m as a result of the sale of shares.</p>

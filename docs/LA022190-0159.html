			<p><P> February 21, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOVIET GROUP CHARGED AS ANTI-SEMITIC  </P> <P> Prosecutors have launched criminal proceedings against Pamyat, a Russian  nationalist group that has been accused of anti-Semitic actions, a newspaper  reported today.  </P> <P> Jewish groups have been demanding for years that Pamyat, a loosely knit  organization with affiliates nationwide, be prosecuted for provocations against  Jews.  </P> <P> Literaturnaya Gazeta, a literary weekly, said Moscow prosecutors are pursuing  charges against Pamyat of "inciting national and racial hatred and strife."  According to the newspaper, Pamyat was charged because of a statement published  in another newspaper calling for a campaign to "de-Zionize" the country.  </P> <P> Many of the thousands of Soviet Jews emigrating to the West say they are doing  so in part because of a reported rise in anti-Semitism. The Soviet press has  responded to the reports recently by carrying statements from government  agencies condemning people who fan inter-ethnic strife and promising to  investigate.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yerah Tal] </F>   [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin intends to summon  Minister Mikha Harish when the latter returns from abroad in  order to demand that Harish explain his complaints to Israeli  correspondents in the United States about the prime minister's  ostensibly rude and insulting attitude to his ministers.    Officials close to the prime minister claimed that Rabin was  furious at Harish, less over the content of his remarks then  about the fact that he made them while on an official trip  abroad. "The amazing thing is that Harish, who holds many  private meetings with Rabin, never expressed any such grievances  to the prime minister," one of Rabin's close associates said.    Several ministers justified Harish's criticism of Rabin, but  insisted that their statements be kept off the record. One of  the ministers said that Harish was not the only one who had been  offended by boorish remarks from Rabin.    Ministers expressed the assessment that Harish's statements  came in the wake of an incident between him and the prime  minister that took place at a recent cabinet session. When  Harish started to leave the meeting, which had gone on for a  long time, Rabin asked him where he was going. Harish replied  that people were just "chattering away" at the meeting while he  had work to do. Rabin got very angry and ordered Harish to  stay. "Listen to the idle chatter and do your work later  tonight," Rabin told the minister who was forced to stay until  the cabinet session was over.    In another instance, Rabin questioned the need for a trip  abroad by Harish, which greatly annoyed the industry and trade  minister.    Labor party sources noted that if Harish criticizes the  prime  minister in such an open and blunt fashion, then Rabin's  position as Labor party chairman is indeed very shaky. On the  other hand, a minister who supports Rabin said that Harish's  remarks should be viewed in the context of the "future  primaries" in the Labor party.</p>

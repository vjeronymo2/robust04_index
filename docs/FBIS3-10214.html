The peaceful occupation, in which dozens of workers  and peasants are participating, was undertaken after it was  rumored that the candidacy of Antonio Ponce, MPD candidate for  deputy from the northern Andean Province of Imbabura, was going  to be disqualified.    MPD leader John Pule accused the TSE members, who belong to  populist, Social Democratic, and rightist parties, of trying to  disqualify that candidacy. Nevertheless, he did not explain the  reason for that fear.    Acting TSE President Medardo Oleas and some TSE members are  meeting with the leaders of the building's occupiers, which is  located in a residential area in northern Quito, to try to solve  the problem.    The TSE is finalizing the details of the legislative,  municipal, and provincial elections that will be held in three  months. These will include a plebiscite on several  constitutional reforms announced yesterday by Ecuadoran  President Sixto Duran-Ballen.</p>

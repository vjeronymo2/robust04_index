			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Why is it when there finally comes a program that has some substance to it and  it is meaty and grown-up that it is pulled from the airwaves? I am referring to  "Heartbeat." It was a great program, along with others that have been pulled  before they are given a fair chance. I don't know who is polled or what their  mentality is, but give us a break, and no more sitcoms that need the brain of  an insect to enjoy. Let's be real. Give us something worth turning on the  television. "Heartbeat," "A Year in the Life," "Our House" and so many others  have been given the round file. Good grief.  </P> <P> Toni Jacobson, Monterey Park  </P></p>

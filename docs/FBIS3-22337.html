			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [by ITAR-TASS correspondent Ivan Zakharchenko] </F>   [Text] Seoul, 24 Feb -- The government of South Korea has  received no notification from Russia that it will continue to  dump its nuclear waste in the Sea of Japan unless it receives  financial aid to build facilities for recycling this waste, an  ITAR-TASS correspondent was told in the department for  environmental protection of the Foreign Ministry of the Republic  of Korea.    The department's spokesman denied a report of the South  Korean agency YONHAP, published on Wednesday, quoting anonymous  sources as saying that the Russian Government has allegedly told  Seoul and Tokyo that it will inevitably dump into the open sea  the nuclear waste from atomic submarines unless other ways of  its disposal could be found. The agency claims that the Seoul  government does not even consider offering material support to  Russia in building facilities for recycling this waste because  the question of recovery of Russia's arrears in repaying South  Korean credits has not yet been resolved.    In this respect, the representative of the South Korean  Foreign Ministry said that these allegations "do not reflect at  all the real stance" of the government of the Republic of Korea.  The possibility of offering help to Russia is now being  considered, he said, refusing, however, to go into further  detail. According to him, such reports divorced from reality,  which appear in the South Korean press, "bring nothing but  deterioration of the relations between the two countries."</p>

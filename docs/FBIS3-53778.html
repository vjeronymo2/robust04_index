Shahidi: "The Confines of Diplomatic </F> Activity"]    [Text] It is a well-known adage that when one is given  permission to enter the village, one goes straight to the fellow  in charge! In our age this common proverb can be applied to the  great Government of Egypt! Recently, the head of the office in  charge of Egypt's interests in Tehran met the Kerman governor  general and expressed the hope that Egypt could further expand  its relations with the Central Asian countries, by forging  relations with Iran.    Apart from this remark by Dr. Faraj, which seems to be in  jest, more than anything else, certain questions come to mind.  However, before answering these questions, it is important to  mention that propounding such proposals which have a completely  political bias should, in principle, be presented through the  proper channels of the Foreign Ministry. How did the head of  the office in charge of Egypt's interests in Iran surface in  Kerman Province and what possible synchronicity could exist  between his political activities and that of the Kerman Province  and why was such a proposal tendered to the governor general?    If such a proposal had been submitted to the Mazandaran  governor general it could be understandable in principle, as  Mazandaran Province is contiguous to one of the newly  independent Central Asian republics. This could be viewed as a  plausible antecedent and would have generated fewer questions.  The following points may be noted in the margin of this meeting  and suggestions provided:    1. According to diplomatic norms, the head of the office in  charge of the interests of other countries should be a citizen  of a third country that has been assigned to safeguard that  country's interests when relations have been severed. He is  supposed to act in the name of that country to preserve these  interests and the flag of the third country is flown over the  office. The head of this office is also permitted to meet with  the host country's officials in the presence of the third  country's ambassador.    In view of the above, the question arises that within all  these legal restrictions, how did the head of the office for  Egyptian interests suddenly show up in Kerman Province and  manage to meet with the governor general? If on the basis of  some agreement, these restrictions have been lifted, is the  official in charge of the office of Iran's interests in Cairo  enjoying similar freedom for diplomatic, economic, and cultural  activity?    According to some who have visited the office for Iranian  interests in Cairo, its activities are extremely limited and the  head of the office is not given permission to meet the higher  officials of the Foreign Ministry. He is not even invited to  the official receptions that are hosted by that country. All  this is in addition to the security problems for the office of  Iranian interests in Cairo, which he faces due to the heavily  policed situation in the Cairo regime.    2. The topic that comes to the minds of readers of this  report is: What is the common factor between the Islamic  Republic of Iran and the anti-Islamic Government of Egypt, that  the head of its interests office was permitted to meet a  governor general of a province far removed from the center?    Is this not the same Egypt that has surpassed all the  tyrants  and pharaohs of history in its suppression of active Islamic  movements and its killing of the oppressed Egyptian people?    On the other hand, according to existing reports, the Cairo  regime is the main base for promonarchical Iranians and the  radio station of these elements affiliated with the former  regime is located in Cairo and broadcasts programs from there at  specific times.    In addition, we wish to remind the head of the Egyptian  interests office in Iran, for his information, that:    First, he is quite well aware of our country's position with  regard to his government and in view of the "complete severance  of relations" between the two countries, such proposals stem  from his political immaturity.    Second, the phenomenon of the so-called "Islamic  fundamentalism" in the Central Asian countries has not reached a  level whereby it has to be suppressed with the help of "foreign  intervention" and by utilizing Egypt's "valuable experience" in  this regard! Therefore, it would be preferable if the Cairo  government is advised to use its experience to surmount the  problems of its own domestic situation which have stifled the  very breath of its regime.    This is because, according to existing information,  President  Husni Mubarak has been greatly perturbed by the cresting of the  Islamic movement in recent months and the assassinations of  those criminals whose hands are stained with the blood of the  Egyptian nation. If he is looking for a scapegoat for a way out  of this predicament, tell him "to look elsewhere."    Third, if--in the past few months--the enrapturing whiffs of  the zephyr which blows in Tehran have made you so delirious that  you are voicing such crude proposals, we declare, for your  information and for that of the government of Cairo, that  nothing has changed and the former position prevails with the  same intensity, especially since in the last few months efforts  are being made to place the filthy mantle of Camp David onto the  oppressed Palestinian nation and to find a way to prevent the  defeat of the ill-omened Gaza- Jericho accord.</p>

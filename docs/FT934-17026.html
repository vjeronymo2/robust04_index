			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Books: A case of deception all round THE UNLIKELY SPY by Paul Henderson Bloomsbury Pounds 16.99, 240 pages THE TRIAL of three former executives of Matrix Churchill, one of Britain's biggest machine tool manufacturers, for breaching export regulations on shipments started quietly for a case that was to erupt into one of the biggest political scandals of our time. There was little to excite the press as the Old Bailey plodded through technical issues about lathes used to make weapons for Iraq. Reporters were reaching for their coats on a typically dreary afternoon when they heard the sort of words that are guaranteed to stimulate a Pavlovian reaction. Defence barrister Geoffrey Robertson, QC, was questioning Ron Ash, the company's head of defence projects. 'Did you know that throughout 1987 and 1988, Mark Gutteridge was working as an agent for British intelligence?' asked Robertson. Ash looked shocked. He knew Gutteridge who had been a close colleague at the company, but he did not know this. 'No,' said Ash. The deliberate injection of spying activities had the desired affect for the defence. It made front page headlines in the New York Times the next day and ensured that the press bench would be packed for the rest of the trial. Publicity was vital for Robertson's game plan. He knew that his client, Paul Henderson, Matrix's former managing director, had also worked for the intelligence services. First he would build up the picture of a hero who risked his life for his country and second, for good measure, he would create in the minds of the jury a fourth defendant, absent from the courtroom - the government itself. When Alan Clark, the former trade minister, stepped into the witness box to give evidence for the prosecution, he was the nearest the court would get to a human manifestation of government. He told the defence that he had coached machine tool manufacturers on how to couch their licence applications in terms that would stress the general applications of the machines. He admitted that he knew the machines would be used for military production. and he agreed he been economical 'with the accualite.' The trial was over. The prosecution could not continue with charges to which the government was an apparent accessory. Clark's performance drew the admiration of Henderson afterwards as he and his colleagues toasted their acquittal. Clark had told it how it was. He had not gone along with the deception. While the Matrix three had been acquitted, the fourth defendant would be dragged back for a re-trial in the form of a judicial inquiry before Lord Justice Scott. Scott's brief was to examine the guidelines on the export of defence equipment to Iraq. The issue of the guidelines which has now eclipsed the Matrix Churchill trial itself was regarded as irrelevant by the Customs and Excise, which brought the charges. They were merely concerned with the product descriptions on the licence applications which they said did not accurately reflect the nature of the exports. This is one of the remarkable elements of the Matrix case. There was deception all round and in retrospect, even having read Henderson's own account, it is difficult to judge just who was deceiving whom about what. There was double-dealing too. No one was more surprised at Robertson's question to Ash than Gutteridge. He had agreed to help the defence but had not intended his name to be introduced in the way that it was. He had not told his family about his spying. It would come as a shock to them. The friendship between Henderson and Gutteridge was severly tested by the revelation but has survived and they continue to work together in the same company. All Henderson ever wanted to do was to make machine tools. He began as a boy apprentice at the company which, after a succession of takeovers would become Matrix Churchill and which he would head. His rise through the ranks, however, coincided with a gradual decline of the British Machine Tool industry. When credit to Eastern Europe ran out, so did the orders. Western companies sought new markets elsewhere. The emergence of Iraq with money to burn would be the saviour of more companies than Matrix. It did not matter to British, German, Swiss and Italian machine tool makers that they were dealing with a regime that gassed its own people. The Matrix directors entered into a Faustian pact with their Iraqi customers who agreed to to buy the company. Because of debt write offs, the Iraqis got the company for nothing. Only afterwards did Henderson discover that two of his fellow directors were Saddam's henchmen, working for Iraqi intelligence. Henderson is an ordinary Midlands businessman who wanted to make money, agreed to help his country, undoubtedly risked his life, and found himself a pawn in one of the great power plays of the 20th century - the struggle between Western ideals and Moslem fundamentalism. His story is only a part of the arms to Iraq affair, but an important part. It exposes corruption in government, corruption in many parts of society, and should be read by all those who ask themselves, how did it happen?</p>

			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Stockport and Southampton swing LABOUR would capture Stockport from the Conservatives with a swing of nearly 7 per cent, according to an opinion poll in last night's Manchester Evening News. Stockport was near to mirroring the national result at the last election, when Mr Tony Favell, the anti-EC Conservative, took 41.4 per cent of the vote against Labour's 35.3 per cent and 22.1 per cent for the SDP/Alliance. Meanwhile, an ICM poll in this morning's Today newspaper shows Labour seven points ahead of the Tories in the key seat of Southampton, Test, where Conservative MP James Hill had a 6,954 majority in 1987.</p>

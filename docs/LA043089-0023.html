			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POOLS &amp; SPAS;  </P> <P> WESTERN WATERSCAPES;  </P> <P> THE NEW WAVE IN POOL DESIGN GOES BEYOND THE BASICS TO CREATE THE TOTAL AQUATIC  ENVIRONMENT  </P> <P> Building a pool today is a lot like buying a car; the options seem endless and  can add up quickly.  </P> <P> A basic, 18x36-foot pool / spa combination from a high-volume Southern  California company starts at about $18,000. For $5,000 more, you can add some  landscaping and perhaps a built-in barbecue. "The cost of building the pool's  shell isn't going to vary more than 10% to 15%," a local pool designer says.  "It's the 'flatwork' -- what's above the ground -- that increases the cost."  </P> <P> A custom pool by an independent pool or landscape designer, however, can start  at about $50,000. Why the price leap? Large companies build hundreds of  standard pools each year using their own in-house designers and fast-working  construction crews. Smaller independents -- landscape designers and architects  -- build fewer pools, usually no more than 12 a year, and offer customized  extras.  </P> <P> Trendy options are an important consideration for many who are in the market  for a pool. Today's upscale homeowners are choosing waterscapes -- total  aquatic environments -- rather than mere pools. A leading look is the "natural"  lagoon, created with a free-form pool surrounded by real or man-made rocks,  sometimes with waterfalls, water slides and recirculating streams that meander  through the rocks before spilling into the pool.  </P> <P> Ten years ago, the height of fashion was the black-bottom pool, touted for its  energy-saving potential (actually, such savings are minimal) and dramatic,  reflective quality. But many homeowners now choose lighter shades of gray that  make the water an inviting deep blue -- less foreboding than the seemingly  fathomless black-bottom look, especially for serious lap swimmers.  </P> <P> Families with small children often opt for wading areas and "beaches" -- edges  of the pool that slope gradually for walk-in entry. Probably the year's most  in-demand options are wet walls and other recirculating-water features that  create soothing, trickling sounds; surprisingly, these are among the least  expensive options. Other homeowners want to enhance their pools with bridges,  steppingstones and sunning and diving decks. One contractor builds spas with  deep wells measured to the owner's height so that he or she can stand with jets  aimed at specific areas of the back.  </P> <P> Newly improved remote controls that operate spa jets and heaters, pool lights  and landscape lighting are also popular options. The same equipment can be  operated from inside the house via programmed gauges (similar to a thermostat)  installed on an interior wall. Even pool lighting is entering a new era: Fiber  optic strips that use no electricity can be installed around the pool's  perimeter, or even underwater, to accent steps.  </P> <P> Since the early '60s, pool and car prices have remained comparable. Today, you  can buy a small, basic BMW for about the same price as an average standard pool  and spa from a large company. Likewise, a custom waterscape by an independent  designer will set you back about as much as an option-loaded prestige car.  </P></p>

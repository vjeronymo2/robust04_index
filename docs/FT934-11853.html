			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Discount clubs face strict tests WAREHOUSE shopping clubs should still be assessed as retailers in spite of Wednesday's ruling in the High Court that a local authority had been right to treat the UK's first proposed discount club as a wholesaler, the government said yesterday. The UK's three biggest supermarket chains, J. Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway, had attempted to block the development, by US club operator Costco, at Thurrock, Essex. They said that the warehouse should have been considered a retailer, not a wholesaler, and been subjected to tougher planning criteria. But Mr Justice Schiemann ruled on Wednesday that Thurrock was entitled to assess the project as a wholesaler. The Department of the Environment said yesterday it expected local authorities to abide by its planning policy guidance note PPG6, issued in July, which advised that 'planning decisions should regard (warehouse clubs) as retail uses'. The joint planning consultant for the three supermarket chains said yesterday that Wednesday's judgment had not ended the debate over warehouse clubs. Mr John Littman of Rapleys, the commercial property agents, said: 'This might be regarded as the first skirmish, but there are still many issues to be decided. Both Mr Littman and the DoE stressed yesterday that the judgment referred to one case, where planning permission had been granted before the publication of PPG6. The department said its note did not seek to define warehouse clubs as retailers or suggest that they should only be granted retail planning consent. But it did advise that authorities should apply the same strict tests to warehouse club applications as they did to retailers, regardless of the type of planning permission sought. Warehouse clubs sell a range of products from computers to cat food in huge, spartan sheds at discount prices to fee-paying members. Mr Littman said the three supermarket chains had not decided whether to continue their battle to establish a legal definition of warehouse clubs as retailers. They are debating whether to proceed with similar legal action already initiated against UK cash and carry operator Nurdin &amp; Peacock, which plans to open a warehouse club at Wednesbury, West Midlands. Retailers' shares continued to fall amid market rumours that Sainsbury was to launch a pre-Christmas price war. Markets report, Page 38</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, 13 Jan (XINHUA) -- Foreign Ministry  Spokesman Wu Jianmin said: The so-called "vacation diplomacy"  is but a new trick of "pragmatic and elastic diplomacy" of the  Taiwan authorities whose aim is still to create "two Chinas" or  "one China, one Taiwan," which is against the fundamental  interests of the Chinese nation including the Taiwan compatriots.    A reporter asked at a news conference this afternoon: Around  the New Year's Day this year, Lien Chan paid a visit to some  countries having diplomatic relations with China in the name of  "a private vacation," which Taiwan describes as "vacation  diplomacy." Do you have any comments on the event?    Wu Jianmin pointed out: China never takes exception to non-  governmental contact between Taiwan and countries having  diplomatic relations with China. However, the relations between  some of those countries and Taiwan have recently gone beyond  that limit. We firmly opposes any form of official contact  between Taiwan and those countries having diplomatic relations  with China.</p>

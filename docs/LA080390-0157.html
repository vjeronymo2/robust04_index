			<p><P> August 3, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COUNTRY SINGER TO RELEASE FIRST SINGLE  </P> <P> Country singer Dale Watson, a regular attraction at Tuesday night Barn Dance  concerts at the Palomino in North Hollywood, will be honored at next week's  show to celebrate the release of his first nationwide single.  </P> <P> Next Friday Curb Records will release Watson's recording, "One Tear at a Time,"  a sad, reflective tune written immediately after he and his wife broke up last  year.  </P> <P> "It's how you should just try to get over things one step at a time," he said.  </P> <P> Watson is applying the same principle to his career. If the song does well on  the charts -- Watson believes it must get in the Top 50 within two months --  Curb will very likely go ahead with plans to release an entire album in the  fall. If not, his contract with the company could be in jeopardy.  </P> <P> "That's why I'm trying not to get too excited over the release," said Watson,  who plans to tour New Mexico, Colorado and Arizona at the end of August. He  said the song is being shipped to country Western radio stations throughout the  country. MICHAEL ARKUSH  </P></p>

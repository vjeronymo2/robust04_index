			<p>931102 FT  02 NOV 93 / Japanese contractor seeks protection with Dollars 5bn debts MURAMOTO Construction, a little-known contractor, became Japan's biggest financial failure for more than 45 years yesterday when it filed for protection from its creditors, unable to pay debts of Y590bn (Dollars 5.57bn). This is by far the biggest single potential loss facing Japan's banking system since the collapse in asset prices started two years ago, sending the economy into recession. Of the 50 banks exposed to the group, the leading creditor is Nanto Bank, the main regional bank in Nara prefecture, western Japan, where Muramoto, the country's 24th-largest general construction group, is based. It has Y56bn of loans to Muramoto, which compares with the bank's Y3,000bn deposit base. Nanto is followed by Daiwa Bank, which has led creditors' negotiations with the company, with loans of Y45bn; Long Term Credit Bank of Japan, with Y38bn; and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, with Y28bn. Muramoto's collapse would cause 'adverse effects' for its creditor banks, but they can absorb the loss between them, a senior official of the Bank of Japan, the central bank, said. Creditors had secured collateral for their loans, and had approved the move in advance, a finance ministry official added. However, the move may increase Japanese banks' caution at a time when lending is already sluggish, one of the factors contributing to the recession. Until yesterday, Japan's largest corporate collapse since 1945 was that of Sanko Steamship, which filed for bankruptcy in 1985 with debts of Y520bn. Teikoku Databank, the private credit research agency, attributed Muramoto's collapse to the failures of property companies with which it had undertaken joint developments. Like other property companies, they suffered in the prolonged decline in property prices. Muramoto, an unlisted company capitalised at Y2.4bn and with sales of Y291.5bn last year, specialises in public works projects, but it diversified into golf course construction and property development in the late 1980s. Its difficulties are thought to have started with the collapse of a property company that had ordered a golf course from the construction group. One of its property development partners, Daito, then went bankrupt. Muramoto yesterday found it was unable to pay its bills after the majority of its creditors had rejected a rescue plan put together by Nanto Bank and Daiwa Bank. It filed for protection under Japan's corporate reorganisation act.</p>

			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / International Bonds: Quebec and World Bank join high-quality issuers THE international bond market had an active day as several high-quality borrowers launched deals in a variety of currencies. Among the previously-announced global deals, the Canadian Province of Quebec's CDollars 1.4bn offering due 2023 was priced yesterday to yield 90 basis points over comparable Canadian government bonds, and kept to that spread when they were freed to trade in the afternoon. Syndicate managers said that a significant proportion of Quebec's bonds were placed in the US and Canada but that there had also been demand from Switzerland, Germany and Japan. The day's other global issue, the World Bank's Y200bn due 2003, is due to be priced early today to yield 25-27 basis points above the benchmark Japanese government bond No 145 due 2002, the same as the yield of the World Bank's first global yen deal which also matures in 2002. An official at IBJ International, the joint lead manager and book-runner of the deal along with Morgan Stanley and Nikko Europe, said he expected the issue to be priced towards the tighter end of the indicated range, in view of the level of demand so far. The official added that between 40 to 50 per cent of the issue was likely to be placed in the Far East, about 30 per cent in Europe and the remainder in the US. The good reception to these two global deals raised hopes that the Kingdom of Sweden's first global offering in dollars would proceed smoothly. The terms of the deal are expected in the next few days. Elsewhere, the European Investment Bank fulfilled market expectations by launching a Ecu500m seven-year bond. The bonds were priced at 98.41 to yield 8.056 per cent, the same yield as the French government's 9 1/2 per cent Ecu-denominated OATs due 2000. The pricing represents a yield spread of 18 basis points above the theoretical Ecu yield curve, which is based on the value of bonds denominated in component currencies. The differential between theoretical and real yields is widest at seven years. For example, the yield spread in the three-year area is virtually flat, in five years it is 10 basis points, and in the 10-year area, three basis points. Syndicate managers said the fact that the EIB's bonds were pitched at the cheapest part of the curve from the investors' viewpoint indicated that there was political pressure on the supranational agency to continue to restore investor confidence in the Ecu-denominated sector of the Eurobond market. 'It is in the EIB's interest that the deal goes well,' said one syndicate manager. When the bonds were freed to trade, they quickly rose to 98.65 bid, giving a yield of three basis points below that of the OATs. In the D-Mark sector, the Spanish region of Andalucia reaped the benefits of a successful presentation to investors in Frankfurt last week, which enabled it to raise the amount of its previously-announced five-year offering from DM300m to DM400m, its maximum requirement. 'The deal was well pre-placed,' said an official at the lead manager Dresdner Bank. He added that the bonds had been evenly distributed in Germany and Switzerland. When the syndicate broke, the bonds rose as high as 101 from a re-offer price of par, but eased back to 100.70 bid in the late afternoon. Compared with other sectors of the market, the D-Mark sector has been relatively neglected in recent weeks, but syndicate managers expect some sovereign and supranational issuers to tap this area in the near future. Belgium is reported to be considering a DM600m offering, while the European Community may raise more than DM1bn. Meanwhile, continued good conditions in the swaps market prompted the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the Kingdom of Denmark to raise Canadian dollars for the second time in less than a month. Yesterday, both borrowers raised CDollars 250m each via five-year offerings. When the syndicate broke on the EBRD deal, the bonds traded at their launch spread of 26 basis points above comparable Canadian government bonds. Denmark's deal was launched later in the day, at a yield spread of 44 basis points above comparable Canadian government bonds, and the bonds were not freed to trade by late yesterday.</p>

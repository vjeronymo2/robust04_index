			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Tawfiq 'Abid] </F>   [Excerpt] Information from Damascus indicates that the  meeting of the 10 Palestinian factions, "the alliance of  Palestinian forces," has failed. According to the information,  the major issues of interest have been delayed for 10 days until  representatives of the alliance recalculate and rethink their  positions.    Ibrahim Ghawshah, official spokesman for the Islamic  Resistance Movement, Hamas, thinks otherwise. He said the above  information is not precise. The Damascus meeting was  successful. It overcame several obstacles and enhanced mutual  trust between the 10 factions.    In a statement to AL-DUSTUR, Ghawshah said: It has been  agreed to stop media criticism between some factions and to  settle any disputes through bilateral and general meetings  between the representatives of the factions. It has also been  decided to set up a technical committee to study the fact that  several parties have been claiming credit for any single jihad  operation in Palestine.    Ghawshah added: More important than all of this was debating  the organizational formula for which the important meeting was  devoted, as well as endorsing a political program and naming the  alliance of Palestinian forces.    He said: Delaying the meeting for five days and Hamas' draft  for an organizational formula has somewhat beclouded the future  of the 10 factions. However, it was explained to the brothers  that delaying the meeting was for technical reasons and that the  proposed formula has been studied and adopted by the movement's  leadership and has its justifications.    Answering a question, he said: The two points raised by the  Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the Popular  Front for the Liberation of Palestine on 25 October 1993 were  settled in the last meeting and a political program was finally  adopted by all the factions. [passage omitted]    Ghawshah said the political program emphasizes that the  basic  arena for jihad is inside the occupied territories. The program  eventually aims at reconstruction PLO institutions on democratic  bases.</p>

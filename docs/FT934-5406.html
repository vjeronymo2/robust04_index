			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Observer: Directorless The Institute of Directors, the talking shop for Britain's boardrooms, is running short of directors. Director-general Peter Morgan bows out next year, and his deputy, John Nicholas, is waving goodbye today after eight years on the job. Although Nicholas's departure from the free-market pressure group is being described as a 'management restructuring', he appears to have been just another casualty of the recession. Faced with a drop in membership from 35,000 to 33,000 over the past couple of years, the IoD has cut its staff by 10 per cent and frozen its annual fees at Pounds 160 for next year. However, the IoD's management has yet to get to grips with its biggest cost centre - its opulent headquarters in Pall Mall, gobbling up a large part of the organisation's Pounds 12m a year running costs. Will Morgan's successor have the stomach to close it down, or at least relocate it to a cheaper end of town?</p>

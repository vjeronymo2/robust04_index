			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> BARRY WON'T BACK ANYONE IN MAYORAL RACE  </P> <P> Mayor Marion Barry said Friday that he will endorse none of the five Democrats  vying for his job and urged his loyalists to back whatever candidate they  choose.  </P> <P> "What I've decided to do . . . is not make any public endorsement," Barry told  about 100 supporters gathered outside the federal courthouse where his drug and  perjury trial is being held.  </P> <P> "Those (supporters) who feel compelled to move on can do so."  </P> <P> Top city government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the mayor  realized that his shrinking number of supporters already were making their own  choices.  </P> <P> "He knows that his organization is already beginning to slip away," said one of  the mayor's top political advisers. "At this point, he doesn't have much to  deliver anyway."  </P> <P> Barry refused to rule out the possibility of making an endorsement in the  future, but said that for now, "I am busy with my trial in the courtroom here."  </P> <P> Barry announced on June 13 that he would not seek a fourth term while battling  the criminal charges. The 54-year-old mayor has pleaded innocent to 10  misdemeanor cocaine possession charges, one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy  charge and three felony counts of lying to a grand jury about his alleged drug  use.  </P> <P> Five candidates are seeking the Democratic nomination.  </P></p>

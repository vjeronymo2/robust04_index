			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 16 Jun (PL) -- Mozambican National Assembly  President Marcelino Dos Santos expressed here his government's  and people's gratitude to Cuba for its contributions to his  country's independence struggle.    During a meeting with Cuban internationalists who fought in  Mozambique and on the occasion of the 19th anniversary of its  independence from Portugal (25 June) Dos Santos recognized the  help they received from Cuba during and after the armed struggle  to consolidate and stabilize that nation.    Dos Santos, who is also president of the Mozambican-Cuban  Friendship Committee, referred to the peace agreements signed in  Rome in 1992 with the opposition movement Renamo [Mozambique  National Resistance] and the difficulties in fully implementing  those agreements due to maneuvers by that armed organization.    Dos Santos is currently on a visit to Cuba which will end on  30 June. During his stay he will meet with several leaders and  will tour centers of economic, historical, scientific,  educational, and social interest.</p>

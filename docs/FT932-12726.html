			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / The Lex Column: UK economy After sterling's devaluation and the four percentage point cut in interest rates since September, it would be deeply worrying if there were no sign of economic recovery. From that perspective, the 0.6 per cent first-quarter rise in non-oil GDP was the least that might have been expected. It leaves the chancellor's Budget forecast of 1.25 per cent for the full year looking conservative. City consensus expectations may move up a further notch to settle above 1.5 per cent, but even that is not much to write home about. More important is whether this is a recovery capable of sustained momentum. Today's CBI trends survey will provide some indication of what follow-through to expect in the second quarter. Doubts remain for the longer term. The debt problems that underlay the recession are not over: negative equity and the stock of repossessed property will restrain recovery in the housing market. Sterling is strengthening again just as exporters need additional competitiveness to confront the downturn in their European markets. Next year's large tax increases may undermine confidence, especially as the perception grows that interest rates have hit their trough. All that fits with an anaemic US-style recovery. The difference is the two successive monthly falls in unemployment. These could be signalling a much stronger recovery than previously expected. It is more likely, however, that patterns of behaviour in the labour market have changed in ways that make it respond more quickly to shifts in economic sentiment.</p>

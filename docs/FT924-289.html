			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / The grimy face of coal: The energy policy review could prove a setback for the environmental cause in the UK Will the environment get a look-in as the UK ponders the future of coal? Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, has put environmental factors on the agenda for his energy review. But he may find it tough to reconcile them with his aim of boosting the use of domestically mined coal. An increase in the quantity of coal burnt would not only raise atmospheric pollution in Britain. It would also drag in other controversial issues, such as acid rain and open-cast mining. Internationally, it would raise doubts about the UK's commitment to the global effort to clean up the environment. In common with its European Community partners, the UK has pledged to cut output of carbon dioxide to 1990 levels by 2000. This was reinforced by an agreement to curb greenhouse gases which Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, signed at the Rio Earth Summit in June. At the time, the UK's goal seemed just about attainable. Carbon dioxide emissions in 1990 were 160m tonnes, and the forecast level for 2000 was in the range of 157m-179m. But this assumed that the electricity generation industry would switch from coal to cleaner natural gas on a large scale. According to a Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) analysis, which was completed just before the crisis provoked by the government's announcement in October of pit closures, the contribution of coal to electricity generation is expected to fall from 68 per cent in 1990 to only 47 per cent in 2000, while the share of gas is likely to go up from zero to 22-23 per cent. But the coal review could throw all these calculations out. A recent report commissioned by the DTI concluded that coal was more harmful than both its main competitors, gas and nuclear, because it causes more deaths, and damages forests and the climate. Furthermore, UK-mined coal is dirtier than imported coal, so any moves to bar imports to protect British Coal would shift the country in a grimier direction. A greater amount of coal burnt would also create difficulties over acid rain. Under the EC's large combustion plant directive, the UK was given lenient targets on sulphur emissions in return for a promise to burn more gas instead of coal. If the UK goes back on that promise, there would be trouble in Brussels. British Coal estimates that the directive only allows the UK to burn 30m-35m tonnes of coal a year, barely half the current figure. And there is a further problem with open-cast mining. Local authorities are under pressure to curb this activity because of the damage it does to the landscape. But open-cast mining is the cheapest method of obtaining coal, and the government may be tempted to relax mine licensing procedures to help British Coal reduce its prices. Knotty though these problems are, they pose less of a dilemma for Mr Heseltine than they do for Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, who has been keeping a low profile in the coal debate. Mr Howard is in a difficult position. He risks being criticised by the green lobby if he fails to press the environmental case. But there is little Mr Howard can say to Mr Heseltine that will be of any help. Mr Howard admits that the energy review will affect environmental policy, but he maintains that it is still a matter of how environmental targets are achieved, rather than whether they can be achieved at all. In presenting a recent policy document on the options for meeting the Rio targets, he said: 'If the energy review says more coal, more savings will have to be found elsewhere.' The coal debate has also put environmentalists on the spot. By instinct, the green lobby is anti-coal because of the emissions problem, but it has been reluctant to come out in outright opposition to preserving the coal industry. One reason is that Mr Heseltine could decide to cut back the nuclear power industry to make more room for coal in the generation market, handing the environmentalists a big victory in one of their longest-running campaigns. Mr Stewart Boyle, energy policy director of Greenpeace, the lobby group, concedes that there is an element of compromise in his position. But he believes the government will be obliged to announce stronger environmental measures as an offset to any moves to boost the coal industry. So the net effect could actually advance the green cause. But how far could Mr Heseltine go, given that environmental measures will only add to the cost of saving the collieries? British Coal estimates, for example, that extracting carbon dioxide from power stations' emissions would add 45 per cent to the cost of electricity. He could provide support for research into clean coal technology, or even subsidise clean-up equipment at power stations, though there are both budgetary and EC limits on the size of subsidies. The short answer to whether the environment will get a look-in as the UK considers the future of coal is no. The coal crisis could mark a setback for the environmental cause and the UK's international commitments. But a balanced answer to the coal dilemma would have to include measures to make coal more environmentally acceptable. An imaginative answer might even include a long-term plan to develop clean coal technology, a field where the UK has played a pioneering role in the past.</p>

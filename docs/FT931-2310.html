			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Tokyo falls 1 per cent in cautious trade INVESTORS adopted a cautious attitude in Tokyo, but Germany's rate cut together with expectations of more economy-boosting steps by the government underpinned the market, Reuter reports from Tokyo. The Nikkei index fell 190.73 or 1.02 per cent to 18,537.17 - for a weekly rise of 2.7 per cent - in volume of 620m shares, compared with Thursday's 650m. The market opened firmer following Thursday's rally, with the Nikkei peaking at 18,835.96, 108.06 points above Thursday's close, in early trade. But the market lost steam in mid-morning in the wake of index-linked selling from investment trusts and profit-taking by institutional investors and the Nikkei dipped to an intra-day low of 18,503.16 in late afternoon trade. Declining issues led advancers by nearly four to three, with 596 lower, 462 higher and 116 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks was down 1.57 to 1,406.69, while in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 6.05 to 1,128.82. A firm yen was seen to discourage foreign investors while political uneasiness in Russia and North Korea also weighed on investors' minds. The market also awaited February preliminary money supply figures with many investors expecting to see modest growth. Many large-capital steel issues gained on the firm yen. Nippon Steel rose Y12 to Y337 and NKK Y2 to Y271. Mitsubishi Heavy, however, fell Y5 to Y537. Brokerages rose on better-than-expected earnings forecast revisions announced on Thursday. Nomura gained Y50 to Y1,890, Nikko Y25 to Y870, Daiwa Y20 to Y1,100 and Yamaichi Y23 to Y673. Construction shares were higher in anticipation of greater public works spending. Ohbayashi rose Y33 to Y570, Kajima Y21 to Y804, Shimizu Y16 to Y896 and Tobishima Y15 to Y551. Roundup PACIFIC Rim markets were mixed. HONG KONG switched its attention away from politics, concentrating instead on encouraging earnings reports from some of the colony's biggest companies. The Hang Seng index finished 37.08 higher at 6,088.34, 1.3 per cent lower on the week, in turnover of HKDollars 2.8bn. Swire Pacific gained 75 cents to HKDollars 31.50, Cheung Kong dipped 10 cents to HKDollars 21.90 and Hutchison Whampoa rose 30 cents to HKDollars HKDollars 16.10 in reaction to their earnings announcements late the previous day. AUSTRALIA began strongly, taking its lead from Wall Street's overnight performance, but the rally was seen to run out of steam as the day progressed. The All Ordinaries index ended 7.5 higher at 1,677.1, little changed on the week, and showing turnover of ADollars 287.3m. Golds were strong, led by a 7 cent gain by Normandy Poseidon to ADollars 1.51. TNT sold 27.7m options in Normandy, completing its exit from the group. News Corp rose 9 cents to ADollars 7.68 on news that it had filed a shelf offering of up to USDollars 1bn of debt securities with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. SINGAPORE closed easier but above the day's low after weakening on rumours that deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's health was worsening. The Straits Times Industrial index fell by 17 points at one stage but rebounded to end 4.01 lower at 1,664.78, little changed on the week. NEW ZEALAND staged a subdued advance which left the NZSE-40 index 9.94 ahead at 1,590.27 but in low turnover of NZDollars 21m. Air New Zealand continued to fare badly, the A shares ending down 6 cents at NZDollars 1.88, a 24 per cent decline since February 1. BOMABY's BSE index fell 16.82 to 2,376.76 as many investors continued to liquidate holdings built up before last month's budget.</p>

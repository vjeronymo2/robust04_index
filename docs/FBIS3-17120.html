			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Georgia's leader Eduard Shevardnadze has warned that  if parliament disapproves his suggestion on the composition of  government, "the issue of the resignation of the entire  leadership, the head of state included, must automatically  arise."    Speaking in parliament before discussion of the composition  of the cabinet, he declared that it would be extremely unwise to  resort "to such decisions (resignations) at this stage."    In the meantime, observers forecast volatile parliamentary  debates Tuesday afternoon. This is borne out by the fact that  even the parliamentary majority, formed to back Shevardnadze's  initiatives, withheld support for most candidates nominated by  him.</p>

			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Weighty tome sends investment banks reeling: Effects of the EU's capital adequacy directive Britain has long prided itself on the rigour with which it polices its securities and banking markets. Its tough stance, regulators argue, has increased confidence in the London markets to the point where roughly 25 per cent of the world's equity trades are executed there. Yet Britain's investment banks are arguing that the tough regulatory stance threatens to place them at a competitive disadvantage to their European Union counterparts. The bone of contention is the EU Capital Adequacy Directive, a lengthy tome whose goal is to ensure that member states go to equal lengths in policing the capital requirements of their own investment banks. The bankers say they fear that French and German regulators will not enforce the rules, which take effect in 1996, with equal vigour, giving banks based in those countries a competitive edge. 'We figure that this directive means that for our trading position in UK equities, we will need two to three times more capital than we now do,' said the director of operations at one large UK investment bank. 'And banks allocate capital on the basis of return. If a particular business isn't earning the same return, we have to ask ourselves whether we should still be in it.' Moreover, the bankers say, it will force them to revamp their information systems to allow them to report to regulators in the manner stipulated by the directive. 'We are looking at all our businesses around the world to see where business is booked and how it is booked and to see if we ought to do things differently,' said a lawyer for one US-based investment bank. When the study is completed, he said, the bank may well decide to book business outside of London. The difficulty, UK investment bankers say, is that the business varies so widely among EU countries that it is impossible to design a single regime which would be suitable for all. For one thing, while most of the securities industry on the Continent is conducted through a division of a universal bank, in the UK many of the largest players are securities firms with a banking arm attached. The directive takes views on this split in the business that UK firms say will work to their disadvantage in several ways. First, the directive makes a distinction between the capital needed to back a 'banking book' and that needed to back a 'trading book'. When it comes to the trading book, the directive takes a different view from that of UK securities regulators. First, it says that capital must be held against both the counterparty risk (the risk of the financial failure of one party) and the market risk of each security. In the UK, the Securities and Futures Authority which regulates the industry has allowed firms to take account of both factors in a single calculation. Moreover, unlike in the UK, the directive does not take account of hedged positions - holdings in securities whose risks offset each other - the way current regulations do. Complicating matters, the Treasury has proposed interpreting the directive definition of 'liquid' securities very narrowly so that only holdings of the largest UK equities will fall into that category. Less liquid stocks require higher capital backing. Also, the directive's 'large exposures' rule creates a hard limit on the value of transactions an investment bank can have with a single counterparty. In the UK, investment banks may increase their exposure so long as they also increase the capital they hold against that position. 'The CAD is going to require us to have real-time calculation of our large exposures,' said a lawyer for one US-based investment bank. 'You will have to know what your exposure is to a single credit all the time and around the world.'</p>

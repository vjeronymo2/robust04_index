			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / The Queen's Speech (Analysis): Scheme to spur inner-city renewal - Housing THE GOVERNMENT will renew its assault on inner-city dereliction in a Housing, Land and Urban Development Bill, which will also extend home ownership to more council tenants and strengthen their hands in getting repairs done to their homes. The headline-catching provision of the bill will be the creation of an Urban Regeneration Agency to co-ordinate the task of regenerating England's inner cities. The agency is to be headed by Mr Peter Walker, a former Conservative minister who retired from the Commons at the last election. The main function of the agency will be to bring back into use vacant and underused land. It will have compulsory purchase powers, in the same way as the existing urban development corporations in London's Docklands and other UK cities, including Liverpool and Birmingham. The corporations have had some success in using limited amounts of government finance to lever in private capital, attracting developers by reclaiming derelict land and putting infrastructure in place. The agency is expected to take over responsibility for administering much of the present government spending on urban programmes. However, ministers appear to have ruled out giving it responsibility for administering City Challenge, the competitive bidding by towns and cities for urban development funds. A second measure in the Bill will offer council tenants a chance to become part-owners of their homes, through rent to mortgage schemes. With more than 1.4m council homes bought by their tenants since 1981 under the hugely successful right to buy legislation, these schemes reach further down the income ladder to those who cannot afford full ownership. In return for accepting some obligations of ownership, the tenant's rent is converted into mortgage payments, buying part of the equity in the home. The intention is that tenants acquire full ownership by stepping up their payments at a later date, or cash in their equity when they move home. However, pilot studies in Scotland, rural Wales, Basildon and Milton Keynes have not indicated great demand for rent to mortgage schemes. Fewer than 400 tenants have taken them up in all four areas. 'Given the low level of take-up so far, there is no reason to believe that a national scheme will be popular,' said Mr John Perry, head of policy at the Institute of Housing. 'And rent to mortgage schemes will do nothing to address the urgent need to help homeowners move back to renting if they can no longer afford to buy.' Also to be strengthened is the right to repair, which allows council tenants to get essential and urgent repairs done when the local authority fails to do them in time. The existing scheme has not been a conspicuous success, mainly because it was administratively cumbersome and relied on the tenant to pay the bill and claim the money back. A consultative paper put out last autumn suggested that tenants should be able to get essential and urgent repairs done by contacting contractors on an approved list who would send the bill for the work to the council.</p>

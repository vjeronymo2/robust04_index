			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Letter: Employee shareholder forgotten Sir, The debate on market making in smaller listed companies' shares has, with the exception of Mr King's letter (September 9), largely forgotten employee shareholders. Companies which are relegated to the Bulletin Board may well experience poor liquidity in their shares. While those that decide to de-list will lose the ready access to an external market in their shares entirely. The impact on employees is clear; they will be less likely to participate in, or value, employee share schemes if they fear they will be left with unsaleable shares. Companies keen to maintain or introduce share incentives for employees should consider setting up an employee share ownership plan (Esop) trust. The Esop can not only match buyers and sellers but also buy and sell shares when there is a temporary excess of demand or supply. If liquidity increases and market-making expands in the shares, the Esop's role diminishes. If, on the other hand, the company decides to de-list, the Esop can take the strain of creating the internal market that makes shares incentives worthwhile.

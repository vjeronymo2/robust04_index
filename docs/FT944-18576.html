			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Hillsdown plans to redefine premium account Hillsdown Holdings, the food manufacturing group, is to seek shareholders' permission to redefine Pounds 420m of its share premium account as other reserves. The company said the move was a technical one which would enable it to use the share premium account reserves to write off goodwill which had previously arisen on acquisitions. The write-offs had amounted to Pounds 562.5m over a number of years, and had previously been set against the profit and loss reserves. The latter stood at Pounds 22m at the 1993 year-end. An emergency shareholders meeting has been set for October 28, and if approved, the company must apply to the courts to approve the change in definition. Hillsdown stressed that the reserves would not be allowable initially as redistributable reserves from which dividends are paid. However, they could become allowable after any restrictions that the court might put on its ruling are met.</p>

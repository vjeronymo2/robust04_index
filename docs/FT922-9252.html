			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Bonn yields to union pay demands WESTERN Germany's 3m public sector workers were ordered back to work last night after the government gave in to union pay demands and political and public pressure for an end to the most disruptive national strike since the war. Despite the initial relief, however, the employers made concessions which will undermine private sector companies' attempts to rein in wage costs and damage the already divided coalition government's own anti-inflation drive. The deal, which incorporates a 5.4 per cent basic pay increase and extra payments to bolster incomes among the lower paid, came at the end of two days of tense, secret negotiations led by Ms Monika Wulf-Mathies, president of the oTV union, and Mr Rudolf Seiters, interior minister. Officials of the GdEP rail and the DAG white-collar union called off their action immediately, closely followed by oTV. An estimated 435,000 workers had joined the strike on what was to be its last day. Ms Wulf-Mathies claimed to be content to have won 5.4 per cent for all, matching an arbitration proposal earlier rejected by the government. Mr Seiters, however, said the overall value of the award was 5.12 per cent and would cost an extra DM16.11bn a year. According to his reckoning, his earlier 4.8 per cent 'final offer' would have cost DM15bn a year. The 12-month agreement, which expires at the end of December, includes DM200 extra holiday pay all round and a one-off DM750 payment for the lower paid, DM600 for the middle ranks, and nothing for the top tier. The basic 5.4 per cent rise is to be back-dated for low-earners to May 1, and the higher-paid will get their increase a month later. Gesamtmetall, the association of engineering companies currently at loggerheads in their pay round, said its employees did not have the general public as paymaster. 'They must earn their pay against hard international competition,' it said last night. Apparently anticipating government concessions, Mr Klaus Murmann, president of the BDA, Germany's biggest employers' group, said earlier in the day that the private sector was absolutely united in its resolve to relate this year's awards to productivity. 'I declare here and now that the result of the negotiations in the public sector can and will have no function as a model for private business,' he said in Bonn. However, the 5.4 per cent headline figure is bound to be seen by private sector unions as the starting point for the next stage of their negotiations. Last year's wave of increases of up to 7 per cent followed a 6 per cent deal in the public sector. IG Metall, the country's biggest union, which represents 4m employees in the engineering industry, yesterday continued a week of warning strikes involving more than 100,000 members.

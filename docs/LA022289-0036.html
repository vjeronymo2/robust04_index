			<p><P> February 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ NOTES ;  </P> <P> MANAGER DENIES MILES DAVIS AIDS REPORT; INSTRUMENTS DONATED TO LOCKE HIGH  SCHOOL  </P> <P> Contrary to a story which appeared in the Feb. 21 issue of the supermarket  tabloid, the Star, trumpeter Miles Davis does not have AIDS, said Davis'  manager, Peter Shukat, on Tuesday. "It's totally unfounded, totally untrue,"  Shukat said of the Star story. Shukat, who issued a press release denying the  story, said the 62-year-old Davis had recently been in the hospital, battling a  mild case of pneumonia and having a benign polyp removed from his vocal cords.  "He's now resting comfortably at his Southland home," Shukat said, "and is in  excellent shape for a man his age." Davis is expected to begin his 1989 world  tour April.  </P> <P> Young student musicians are invited to apply for the sixth annual Dolo Coker  jazz scholarship, given in memory of the fine pianist who was an integral part  of the Los Angeles jazz scene for many years.  </P> <P> Coker, who resided in the Southland from the late '50s until his death in 1983,  recorded several LPs as a leader and backed such greats as saxophonists Sonny  Stitt, Dexter Gordon and Art Pepper, trumpeter Kenny Dorham and drummer Philly  Joe Jones.  </P> <P> The scholarship, which is awarded to full-time high school or college musicians  -- ages 15-25 -- was created to both assist students seeking a career in jazz  and to perpetuate the art form itself. The winners of this year's scholarships  will perform at a benefit concert -- headlined by singer O.C. Smith, saxman  Herman Riley and pianist Art Hillery -- for the Dolo Coker Scholarship  Foundation, to be held at the Musicians' Union in April. Information: (213)  666-3700.  </P> <P> BASSIC GIVING: Blues composer-bassist Willie Dixon, whose classic songs such as  "The Seventh Son" and "Spoonful" have been recorded by such jazzmen as Mose  Allison and Gil Evans, is donating $3,000 worth of Yamaha musical instruments  to Watts' Locke High School in memory of the late blues singer, Big Joe Turner.  Dixon, a resident of Glendale, will make the donation -- which includes a  matching grant from Yamaha Corp. -- through his Los Angeles-based Blues Heaven  Foundation at a presentation at Locke on Thursday. To make sure the students  have something to play the donated instruments on, Dixon is also giving the  high school a stage band arrangement of his tune, "My Babe," scored by Lisa  Webb, a graduate of North Texas State University.  </P> <P> AROUND L.A.: The ebullient trumpeter Jack Sheldon's musical life used to be  something like a lyric from the Dave Frishberg-Bob Dorough tune, "I'm Hip": "I  was hep when it was hip to be hep."  </P> <P> While a developing player here in the early-to-late '50s, native Floridian  Sheldon -- though originally influenced by swing-era players -- emulated the  then-in-vogue bop sounds of Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie.  </P> <P> "I loved Roy Eldridge, especially his version of 'Rockin' Chair,' with Gene  Krupa's band," Sheldon, 58, said the other day. "Then I heard Bird and thought,  'What is this?' It sounded really strange. But since I was supposed to like  that kind of music, to be hip, I liked it. I did the whole thing, wore a beret,  carried my trumpet in a leather bag. I was going with my peers." Sheldon's  fiery bebop style can be heard on a number of LPs he made with the likes of  altoist Art Pepper and bassist Curtis Counce.  </P> <P> But when he joined the band on the Merv Griffin Show in 1960, Sheldon -- who  appears in North Hollywood Tuesday and Wednesday at the Money Tree and Sundays  at Alfonse's -- changed. "We started going to New York to play, and there they  have more reverence for old guys, plus I got to hear Roy (Eldridge) and Ruby  Braff play that older style, and I saw how good it was," he said. "So instead  of trying to be hip, now I can really appreciate all these people."  </P> <P> Sheldon's current performance finds him mixing searing trumpet work on the  great standards with vocals and comedic banter. "I started doing comedy and  singing when I was working with (singer) Julie London and (pianist) Bobby Troup  in 1957-58," said Sheldon, whose latest LP is "Hollywood Heroes" (Concord  Jazz). He says he gets the material from everyday existence. "My life is in  utter chaos, so my stories about alcoholism, drug abuse, overeating and bad  luck with women come from real true things," he said, only half kidding.  Sheldon has been a recovering alcoholic for several years.  </P> <P> Deciding a year ago he needed help, hornwise, Sheldon began studying trumpet  with Uan Rasey, former first trumpeter at MGM Studios. "I had come up with my  own way of playing, and he's teaching me to be a better player," he said. "Now  I'm slowly getting better rather than slowly getting worse."  </P> <P> RECOMMENDED RECORDINGS: Billy Pierce's "Give and Take" (Sunnyside) finds the  former Art Blakey tenor sax star fronting a quintet of talented young lions  that includes pianist Mulgrew Miller and trumpeter Terrance Blanchard. Pierce,  who's gradually shedding the Coltrane influence he's worn like a second skin,  offers "Altered States" which races along at a gallop, "Farewell to Dogma," a  sweet-then-edgy bossa where Blanchard and Miller deliver lucid, winsome  statements, and "Aria's Dance," a full-of-juice unaccompanied romp.  </P></p>

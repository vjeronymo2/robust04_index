			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): NatWest to impose 7.5% pay increase NATIONAL Westminster Bank told its 80,000 UK staff yesterday that it was introducing measures that will give pay rises of 7.5 per cent and allow the bank to require more flexible starting times from employees. The measures are being adopted in spite of strong opposition from Bifu, the financial services union, which is organising a strike ballot in pursuit of an improved offer. NatWest said it had decided to go ahead after members of the NatWest Staff Association voted in favour of acceptance. Its decision follows an offer by Lloyds Bank to raise staff salaries by only 5 per cent. The Lloyds and NatWest increases were due to operate from April 1. Barclays Bank, the first of the big four clearing banks to settle on pay this year, agreed a package worth more than 7 per cent over the full year. NatWest said 70 senior executives would receive no cost-of-living rise this year, although they would be eligible for performance pay rises. Bifu is opposing the deal because of the level of rises and the increased flexibility it requires on hours. The bank says it needs to vary starting times between 8am and 10am to provide a better service. It recently announced extended opening hours. Unions representing 50,000 professional and technical workers in the National Health Service, including medical laboratory staff and technicians, were yesterday offered a 7.9 per cent pay rise or Pounds 11.50 a week, whichever is the larger. Unions including MSF, the general technical union, have until May 17 to respond. The proposed increase is the same as that offered to ambulance staff and NHS administrative and clerical workers. Ancillary workers have been offered a more complex package that would add 8.8 per cent to their pay bill at the end of the year.</p>

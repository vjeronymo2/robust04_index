			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / International Company News: CNP advances 14.9% to FFr691.5m midway Caisse Nationale de Prevoyance, the French state-owned insurance group, achieved net profits of FFr691.5m (Dollars 130.71m) in the first half of the year, a 14.9 per cent rise over the same period in 1993, writes John Ridding in Paris. Mr Pierre Darnis, chairman, said the increase in profits was achieved on revenues of FFr39.6bn, a rise of 19 per cent over the first six months of last year. The insurance group is being prepared for a partial privatisation, which is expected to take place by the end of the year. Under the terms of the operation, the government will reduce its 42.5 per cent direct holding in the company. However, the state will retain control of the group through indirect investments via the post office and the Caisse des Depots, the state financial institution. Observers believe the state will sell about 30 per cent of CNP's capital, which would bring estimated receipts of about FFr4bn. Analysts have valued the company as a whole at about FFr12bn. CNP, which specialises in life insurance products, has enjoyed rapid growth over recent years, increasing its sales by more than 50 per cent in 1993 to FFr64.3bn. It achieves most of its sales through post office and savings bank branches and through tax offices.</p>

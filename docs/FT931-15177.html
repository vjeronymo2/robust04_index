			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Arts: Today's Television Required watching tonight should be The Essential History of Europe; Greece (BBC 2, 8.00). Greeks can generally be relied upon to lose all sense of intellectual detachment whenever the subject arises of the relationship between the modern Greek nation and the ancient Macedon of Philip and Alexander. But as the matter of Macedon acquires ever more ominous undertones, it is worth making the effort to disentagle the truth from nationalistic myth-making. The Sexual Imperative (C4, 9.00) is a highly watchable popularisation of the neo-Darwinists' view of the mating game. Tonight's programme examines polygamy versus monogamy in terms of the better stratagem for the survival of genes into the next generation. When males of the species lock horns over females there are winners and losers. Females, on the other hand, are invariably the winners because they end up mating with the roughest, toughest, genes on the block. Black Bag Special (C4, 8.30) follows up its 1991 story about the Cardiff Three by interviewing the men set free after the latest revelation of a miscarriage of justice.</p>

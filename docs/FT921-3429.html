			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Letter: TECs are failing special needs trainees Sir, I read with interest Anne Weinstock's article 'Low marks for slow learners' on the training of people with 'special needs' (Management, March 11). Her article raises a number of important issues which call for urgent attention. In recent weeks, I have been privileged to meet a number of dedicated providers of training who are training young people and adults. Many of the trainees have severe learning difficulties, or other special needs. Everyone concerned would echo strongly the comments made by her. The annual round of negotiations between TECs (Training and Enterprise Councils) and training providers, particularly for those in the voluntary sector, is becoming a veritable nightmare. Again this year, many fear that they will be unable to continue to operate at the level of funding on offer and with the conditions attached. As a precautionary measure, many have issued redundancy notices to their staff. TECs seek to be as flexible as they can with their funding and they are not unsympathetic to the needs of the disadvantaged. The fact is, however, that by no means all TECs really understand these needs, nor thought that they would find themselves involved in the world of special needs training provision. At the end of the day, TECs quite understandably tend to back options which secure their own funding. Three issues need to be addressed. In the first place, serious consideration should be given to 'ring fencing' funding for special needs training. This is not a new idea. It was proposed in the report of the special training needs task force established by the NCVO (National Council for Voluntary Organisations), which was published in June 1991. The government promised to consider the report seriously but it has presumably rejected the approach, as it does not feature in current discussions. The idea merits further consideration because it would at least provide funding reassurance. In the second place, the output-related element of funding should be set at a level and should be governed by criteria much more clearly related to trainees and their potential for learning. In the third place, progress should be made towards giving quality training providers more than a one-year contract and the tendency towards requiring tendering from existing and long-established training providers should be stopped. Any TEC that has doubts about the maintenance of quality standards has only to give due warning that contracts will not be renewed unless standards improve.

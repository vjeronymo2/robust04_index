			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Finance Ministry made it clear on 31 December  that it would lower the growth rate of the Official Development  Assistance (ODA) in the general account of the 1994 budget from  the 1993 level of 6.5 percent to 3 percent on grounds of the  tight fiscal situation. The Finance Ministry is maintaining  that it would be possible to keep the ODA at a high level in  U.S. dollar terms due to the appreciation of the yen. The  Foreign Ministry, however, is contending that it is necessary to  increase the ODA by more than 5 percent in order for Japan to  make clear its attitude toward international contributions.  Hence, the two ministries are expected to wage a fierce battle  over 4 percent. [sentence as published]    The government, in the 5th ODA Medium-Term Plan (from 1993  to  1997) set in June 1993, announced its commitment to a total of  $70-70.5 billion in the ODA over five years. It is necessary to  continue to raise the ODA by 7 percent every year in dollar  terms to fulfill the commitment. In late August last year, the  foreign minister asked for 1,098.4 billion yen for the ODA in  its preliminary budget request for the fiscal 1994 and the  amount was up 8.3 percent from that of a year earlier.    In response, the finance minister plans to curb the ODA's  growth at 3 percent, claiming that: 1) we have no choice but to  keep the ODA's growth in check; and 2) it is possible to  maintain the ODA at a high level thanks to the drastic  appreciation of the yen. The Finance Ministry is also asserting  that the country's "ODA is the world's greatest in absolute  terms, and the ODA needs to shift its priority from quantity to  quality," (according to the Budget Bureau). The ministry plans  to study the possibility of increasing the amount of technical  assistance it gives after concluding that to help developing  countries develop their industries, the ODA must focus on the  development of human resources rather than on one-time grant aid.    Meanwhile, the Foreign Ministry is saying that given the  appreciated yen, sluggish growth in the ODA is inevitable.  However, the ministry is strongly arguing that it is necessary  to raise the ODA by 5 percent in order for Japan to make clear  its posture toward international contributions. Hence,  coordination of views between the two ministries is likely to  run into problems.</p>

			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Mission to Cambodia begins THE UN Security Council yesterday launched a peace-keeping and election monitoring operation for Cambodia, the biggest ever undertaken by the world body. Initial estimates put the cost for a 15-month period at Dollars 1.9bn for 15,900 troops and thousands of civilian officials charged with supervising elections. However, it may prove possible to reduce costs after Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, reviews the situation during a visit to Cambodia in April. After the Council's unanimous vote, he told members that current plans were not definitive and there would have to be 'a measure of flexibility in the conduct of this operation'. He has asked for Dollars 200m in start-up money without delay in the hope that the first contingents may be sent soon.</p>

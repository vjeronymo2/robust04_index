			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Zeneca sees recovery in UK and US Healthcare markets in continental Europe remain depressed, while those in the UK and US are gradually recovering, according to Zeneca, the pharmaceuticals company, writes Daniel Green. In its first quarterly trading statement since its demerger last summer from ICI, it paints a broadly positive picture of its own trading in the second half of 1993. All three of its businesses, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and seeds, and specialities, contributed to an improvement over the second half of 1992. Sales on the pharmaceuticals side improved, in spite of the continuing decline of Tenormin, a heart treatment that was once easily the company's best selling drug. Tenormin's US patents have run out and it is now subject to competition from generic alternatives. Pharmaceutical profits are expected to be slightly higher in the second half. Agrochemicals and seeds continued to be depressed by the reform of the European Union's agriculture policy, although there has been growth in southern hemisphere markets.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Commenters also suggested that the agencies should permit a regulated institution that purchases a pool of loans, invests in mortgage-backed securities, or secures a mortgage warehousing loan with real estate notes, to confirm that the loans have appropriate appraisals without reviewing the appraisal for each underlying loan. The agencies agree that it should not be necessary to review the appraisal for each underlying loan in all cases. The agencies believe that regulated institutions may use sampling and audit procedures to determine whether appraisals for the underlying loans in a loan pool satisfy the regulation's requirements and to verify the seller's representations and warranties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agencies also believe that a regulated institution may presume that the underlying loans in an investment-grade, marketable, mortgage-backed security satisfy the requirements of the appraisal regulation whenever an issuer makes a public statement, such as in a prospectus, that the appraisals comply with the agencies' regulations. To be considered investment grade, a security must be rated in one of the top four rating classifications of at least one nationally recognized statistical rating service. A marketable security is one that may be sold with reasonable promptness at a price that corresponds to its fair value.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For mortgage warehousing loans, sale to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac of the mortgages that secure the mortgage warehouse loan may be used to demonstrate that the underlying loans complied with the appraisal requirements of the agencies' regulations. The institution, however, must continue to monitor its borrower's performance in selling loans to the secondary market and take appropriate steps, such as increased sampling and auditing of the loans and their documentation, if the borrower experiences more than a minimal rejection rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (9) Transactions Insured or Guaranteed by a U.S. Government Agency or U.S. Government Sponsored Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agencies are adopting a uniform exemption for transactions that are wholly or partially insured or guaranteed by a United States government agency or government sponsored agency because these loans pose little risk to insured institutions. This exemption will eliminate the confusion among regulated institutions who may believe that two separate appraisals are required_one meeting the banking agencies' regulations and another meeting the federal loan programs' standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The prior regulations of the OCC, FDIC, and OTS exempted many of these transactions. However, they previously required that these transactions be supported by an appraisal that conformed to the requirements of the insuring or guaranteeing agency. Prior to adoption of this amendment, the Board's appraisal regulation did not specifically exempt these transactions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federally insured or guaranteed transactions must meet all the underwriting requirements of the federal insurer or guarantor, including real estate appraisal requirements, in order to receive the insurance or guarantee. The agencies believe that the standards of these loan programs are sufficient to protect the safety and soundness of regulated financial institutions. Therefore, it is unnecessary to require that these transactions also meet the overlapping requirements of the banking and thrift agencies' appraisal regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some commenters suggested that the agencies should limit the application of this exemption to federal loan programs with appraisal requirements that conform to the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) and require the use of licensed or certified appraisers. In addition, commenters raised concerns that some loan programs may not have appraisal standards and asked the agencies to list those loan programs to which this exemption applies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OMB has directed federal agencies with government guaranteed or insured loan programs to conduct real estate appraisal programs in a manner to reduce default risks to the federal government. Specifically, these federal agencies are required to ensure that all real estate credit transactions over $100,000 have an appraisal performed by a state licensed or certified appraiser and that the appraisal be conducted under appraisal standards that are consistent with the USPAP. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> OMB Circular A&hyph;129, ``Policy for Federal Programs and Non-Tax Receivables,'' revised January 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

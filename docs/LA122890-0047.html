			<p><P> December 28, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WHERE ARE THEY NOW? 6 STORIES REVISITED;  </P> <P> THEATER: ENCINO AND CSUN PROGRAMS PERSEVERE, WHILE PLANS FOR SHERMAN OAKS GROUP  ARE UNCLEAR.  </P> <P> The founders of the new Encino Playhouse managed to pull off a rare feat for a  fledgling theater group: They made their debut on schedule.  </P> <P> As they had promised in June, the company staged its first show in September in  a 250-seat theater in the Encino Community Center. "Gift Rap," a children's  show, ran for five weeks.  </P> <P> December has been hectic for the group, which earlier this month staged  "Holiday Faire," another musical for children, and "The Cardigan Christmas  Show," a sendup of traditional holiday specials on television.  </P> <P> In February, the Playhouse hopes to raise enough money to stage its first  original show, "Miss Moffat," a musical based on the play "The Corn Is Green."  The musical, although never previously performed, has a long history. Its book  was written by Joshua Logan and Emlyn Williams, both of whom have since died,  and the music was composed by another theater veteran, Albert Hague.  </P> <P> "Miss Moffat" was brought to the attention of the founder of the Encino  Playhouse, Stephanie Angelini, by Thomas O'Malley, a writer who had been trying  to get the musical on its feet. O'Malley has done some rewriting for the local  production, which will be staged only if the playhouse can raise the necessary  funds.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the founders of a Sherman Oaks group known as the Valley Civic Light  Opera have not fared as well. They announced in March that by the end of the  year, they intended to start a subscription season of major musicals in the San  Fernando Valley, but the promised season did not materialize. Future plans are  unclear. Telephone messages left on the answering machine at the group's office  in Sherman Oaks were not returned.  </P> <P> And at Cal State Northridge, officials have decided to continue the  university's highly touted Teen-Age Drama Workshop, which has offered summer  acting instruction to high school students for 34 years.  </P> <P> Continuation of the program was thrown into question by the new year-round  schedule for public schools. It was feared that not enough students would be  available to take the workshops in the summer.  </P> <P> "We have decided to go ahead, although we are still working out what would be  the best dates for the workshop," said Heinrich Falk, acting chairman of the  CSUN theater department.

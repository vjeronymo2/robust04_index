			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Property: Manchester's waterway finds a safe berth - The outlook for the canal has been transformed by land development along its banks Manchester Ship Canal, which Queen Victoria opened 100 years ago tomorrow, symbolises the nature of economic regeneration in north-west England. A decade ago, the canal terminated in Manchester's disused docklands. It was still a profitable waterway - but only because of trade in its lower reaches, where ships service the petrochemical industries of the Mersey estuary, 30 miles away. The trade was mature, the prospects unexciting. Today, however, prospects are as exciting as the canal was revolutionary in 1894. This is because the canal's future is linked, ironically, not to water, but to land: specifically, a string of developable plots of land along its banks. The Manchester Ship Canal company has been transformed into a property company and absorbed by Peel Holdings, a quoted property group chaired by Mr John Whittaker, who made his mark in the industry during the heady 1980s. MSC's transformation has been helped by two (now defunct) enterprise zones - at Salford Quays and Trafford Park, with the canal and its dockland basin dividing the two - but it took Mr Whittaker, who had no links with the canal, to recognise the waterway's pot-ential. He realised that MSC's true potential lay not in its (declining) waterway but in its portfolio of developable land along the canal's banks. This insight triggered one of the more bruising takeover battles of the 1980s as Mr Whittaker, through one of his private family businesses, started buying MSC shares in 1985. Mr Whittaker was particularly impressed with 300 acres of canalside land at Dumplington on the western fringe of Trafford Park, where a convergence of motorways or trunk roads put about 7m people within 40 minutes' driving distance. It was an ideal spot for an out-of-town shopping centre. Unfortunately for him, Mr Nicholas Berry, another entrepreneur, had also recognised MSC's land-owning potential. He bought a stake in the company in 1986 with a view to thwarting Mr Whittaker, whom he thought was getting MSC too cheaply at Pounds 7 an ordinary share. The result was a stand-off. Though Mr Whittaker obtained a majority of shares and votes in 1987, Mr Berry retained enough of a minority holding to impede Mr Whittaker's plans, as he needed 75 per cent shareholder approval to exercise absolute control. The dispute became a public wrangle over the potential value of MSC if the proposed shopping centre were to be developed at Dumplington. The row dragged on for years as plans for Dumplington became bogged down in public inquiries; at the same time the burden of Peel's high borrowing and the impact of recession combined to restrict Mr Whittaker's negotiating position viz-a-viz Mr Berry. The wrangle was finally resolved last year, with Mr Robert Hough, chairman of the canal company, acting as peace broker. Peel was by then recovering from recession and could afford Mr Berry's settlement price of Pounds 30 a share. The cessation of hostilities between Mr Whittaker and Mr Berry paved the way for Peel - which by 1991 had absorbed the Whittaker family's MSC holdings - to wholly subsume the canal company last year. MSC still exists as a statutory company with navigation rights and drainage obligations, but it is no longer listed on the stock exchange. Prospects now look promising for Peel. A lack of good public transport to the old Manchester docklands has inhibited lettings at Salford Quays, but Manchester's 'supertram' will be extended there next year, making the city centre only a 10 minute ride away. Peel will eventually contribute substantially to extend 'supertram' through Trafford Park to Dumplington, where the Trafford Centre, as the regional shopping complex will be known, will be located. The Trafford Centre is still awaiting the green light following argument this week in the Court of Appeal, but Mr Hough says Peel, of which he is now deputy chairman, is well-placed whatever happens. 'Peel has 15,000 acres of land, of which 6,000 acres came with the canal (company). We are in it for the long term and can afford a measured approach to speculative development by releasing land according to demand, timing it with the economic cycle,' says Mr Hough. 'There can be nothing short term. It has taken two recessions to transform Salford Quays and Trafford Park, but you can see the result when you look out of our boardroom window,' he adds. The view from the boardroom - on the top floor of Quay West, a new eight-storey building in Trafford Park - is evidence of the transformation taking place. The building stands on the water's edge of what were once Manchester's docks, facing northwards across the main basin to Salford Quays, a few hundred yards away. To the east lie the new office buildings of Exchange Quay, with the Manchester city centre a mile or so beyond. Westward lies the canal. The contrast with 12 years ago is striking: then Salford Quays were largely empty but for a copse of disused cranes, and Trafford Park - Europe's first industrial estate which grew on the back of the cheaper route to world markets created by the canal - looked as though it might become overgrown with weeds. A decade ago, the basin, which Peel intends to open up to leisure craft by driving a channel through to the nearby Bridgewater Canal, was choked with the unsinkable plastic flotsam of urban dereliction: the wind would blow it up against the canal's locks, where it festered and stank. The transformation is still going on, with constant improvements to infrastructure and a steady clearance and clean-up of the basin's edge and canalside. Moreover, there has been encouraging demand for office space. Mr Hough says only 600,000 square feet of office space in the area are vacant, down from 1.5m sq ft at the bottom of the economic cycle in 1991. 'The market has turned; there is no doubt at all,' he says. 'This calendar year we have seen a rise in interest. There is still an oversupply, but take-up is much more apparent. Headline rents here are Pounds 10-Pounds 20 compared with more than Pounds 20 in Manchester city centre prime. 'It's the most active interest for three years. There are serious prospects for every square foot of space available.'</p>

			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Menem set for second term in Argentina: Sunday's poll is likely to pave way for necessary change in country's constitution Argentina's President Carlos Menem is set to be the main beneficiary of next Sunday's elections for a constituent assembly to rewrite the country's 1853 constitution. The principal item on that assembly's agenda is to eliminate a clause forbidding incumbent presidents succeeding themselves. A decisive victory for Mr Menem's Peronist party on Sunday will virtually ensure he fulfils his overriding ambition - winning a second term as president. Polls predict the Peronists will take 43-45 per cent of the vote, crushing the main Radical opposition party, which is expected to get 24-26 per cent. The outline of the proposed new constitution is already clear. The two parties agreed the main elements in in Congress last December and limited the assembly's deliberations but barring amendments not mentioned in the resolution. In addition to allowing the re-election of the incumbent president, the term of office is to be reduced from the present six to four years. If Mr Menem wins next year's presidential elections, which looks certain at the moment, he will govern Argentina until 1999, when he will be 69. In other reforms, part of the president's duties will be carried out by a cabinet chief, a sort of prime minister who can be removed by Congress with a simple majority vote. The opposition hopes this will reduce the president's powers, but Mr Menem has warned he will not cede significant powers. The 48-member Senate will be increased by half and the 24 new seats allocated to the opposition. The president's right to rule by decree will be restricted. He will be forbidden from issuing them on tax, criminal law or electoral issues. A council of jurists will select judges and oversee management of the judiciary. At present, judges are selected by the executive and approved by the Senate. The supreme court is responsible for the management of the judiciary. This is intended to strengthen the court's independence. The opposition will appoint the head of the national audit bureau, which monitors government spending, and it will be subordinated to Congress. The current, toothless audit bureau is part of the executive. The constitutional reform is a triumph for Mr Menem's formidable political skills. He needed the backing of his old rival, Mr Raul Alfonsn, the former president and now Radical leader, to win the two-thirds majority vote in Congress to start the reform process. He achieved this by threatening to call a plebiscite last November. Mr Alfonsn feared defeat would destroy the Radicals and divide the country. He decided to open secret negotiations with Mr Menem but demanded, and won, a purge of supreme court justices as a gesture of good faith. Mr Menem has a positive poll rating of 47 per cent, despite growing economic hardship and widespread disgust at government corruption. Argentina has a tradition of strong leaders and voters see no alternative to Mr Menem. Furthermore, they are content to see a successful government continue in office. However, the elections have aroused scant interest. Pollsters are predicting the lowest voter turnout since the 1930s. Mr Menem has become Argentina's strongest leader since Juan Peron was president in 1946-55. He has amassed greater personal power than the nine generals who ran the country intermittently between Peron's fall and the return of civilian rule in 1983. However, Mr Menem owes much of his popularity to the successful market-oriented policies if his economy minister, Mr Domingo Cavallo. The Radicals' ineptitude and the strong Peronist party machine have also helped him. The new constitution promises a continuation of 'Menemismo', rather than the creation of strong, independent institutions Argentina needs to consolidate its economic reforms. 'In the short and medium term there will be no change in the accumulation of power in Menem,' says Mr Rosendo Fraga, a political analyst. Key amendments, such as reform of the judiciary, require passage of enabling legislation through Congress, which is controlled by the government, he points out.</p>

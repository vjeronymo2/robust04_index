			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "After Flight 63"] </F>   [Text] On January 25, 1994, fourteen hours after the  failure of Flight 63, Arianespace Chairman Charles Bigot held a  press conference in Kourou. His initial comments were:    "Flight 63 was interrupted after a perfect sequence of  preparation, checking and launch operations, after normal  functioning of the first and second stages and strap-on  boosters, after equally correct separation and ignition of the  third stage, followed by normal operation for approximately 80  seconds. Then the third staged stopped. The two satellites  could not be placed into orbit, and the stage and satellites  fell into the Atlantic Ocean, a few thousand miles from the  African coast.    ``We would like to report our apologies and regrets to our  two customers, for an accident which deprives them of the  services expected from their satellites, TURKSAT 1A and EUTELSAT  II-F6. We deeply share their disappointment (...).    ``After 26 highly-successful launches over close to four  years, we have placed 40 satellites into orbit in a most  satisfactory and, in most cases, remarkable manner. Today,  Ariane meets with a failure. We take this failure very  seriously, but also calmly, because we know that our launch  system is reliable. We also know that it is not perfect. We  will therefore actively look for all causes of the accident and  correct them. This will make our system stronger and more  reliable.    ``As of now, our analysis of the initial parameters is as  follows: The third-stage engine stopped because the liquid  oxygen turbopump stopped after about 80 seconds of operation,  thus ending the oxygen flow. The turbopump itself stopped  functioning because of abnormal heating of a turbopump shaft  bearing.    ``Naturally, it is now up to the Inquiry Board to thoroughly  analyze and understand the reasons for this excessive heating.    ``The nature of this event allow us to hope for a diagnosis  and the definition of corrective measures without delay. With  the help of the entire industry, the French space agency CNES  and the European Space Agency, Arianespace is determined to make  all efforts required for a quick resumption of launches.    ``We maintain our launch objectives over the duration of our  order book, as Arianespace's priority is always to serve its  customers. Naturally, all further information will be given to  them in priority, in accordance with the policy of total  transparency which presides over all our customer relations.''  <H5>  [Box, p 1] </H5> <H5>  Appointment of the Inquiry Board </H5>   Following the failure of Ariane's 63rd flight on January 24,  1994, Arianespace, in liaison with ESA and CNES, has set up on  January 26 an Inquiry Board composed of independent experts.  Its mandate is to establish the causes of the failure of Flight  63 and to recommend all the necessary measures to be taken to  correct the anomalies found. The Inquiry Board is composed of  the following members:    - President: Jean-Paul Herteman (SNECMA, France)    - Vice-president: Eric Slachmuylders (ESA)    Carl-Helmut Dederra (DASA, Germany)    Mauro Varetti (FIAT, Italy)    Jean-Paul Bozet (Universite de Liege,  Belgium)    Michel Pons (CNES, France)    It is requested that the Board submit its initial  conclusions  in mid-February.</p>

			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / Britain expected to bridle at EC foreign policy plan BRITAIN is expected to bridle at plans laid before EC foreign ministers today by the Luxembourg presidency for implementing common foreign policy decisions by majority vote, and for the European Parliament to have a say in Euro-law making equal to that enjoyed by governments. These two key plans have been released for foreign ministers to discuss at today's session of the inter-governmental conference (IGC), ahead of the 95-page compromise text on political union that Luxembourg is tabling tomorrow. The two IGCs on political and monetary union have been in session for three months, and Luxembourg is seeking overall agreement by late June. Luxembourg officials claimed yesterday their text on common foreign and security policy (CFSP) had been well received by EC partners, and even British diplomats admit that since the Luxembourg draft is drawing equal fire from proponents and opponents of fast moves to a CFSP, the presidency has probably judged it right. Britain has always objected to the possibility of being outvoted in so sensitive an area as foreign and security policy. But the Luxembourg plan only foresees that 'the means of applying a common action would be adopted by majority vote', preserving unanimity as the rule by which the Twelve would carry out a CFSP. Initial areas of 'common action' would include arms co-operation and control, UN peace-keeping operations, and possibly, relations with the US and Eastern Europe. EC leaders could by unanimity at their regular summits decide on more such areas of common action, in which governments would be constrained, politically but not legally, from acting freelance. A particular article of the Luxembourg draft would require Britain and France, the EC's only two members in the UN Security Council, to put their voting there in line with EC partners' wishes. To the relief of Britain, neutral Ireland and pacifist Denmark, the Luxembourg draft skates over EC relations with the Western European Union defence organisation in one sentence, saying the decision with defence implications 'can be entirely or partially implemented in the framework of the WEU to the degree they also come within the competence of this body'. But to placate those mainly Latin countries which want to bring defence within the EC faster, the draft says the WEU arrangement 'could be reviewed, on the basis of a report to be submitted by 1996 at the latest' to an EC summit. The Luxembourg compromise on the parliament is to deny it a right of initiative, but give it 'co-decision' with the EC Council of Ministers on a new category of 'framework laws'. Now, the parliament can only amend, but not totally reject, EC legislation. Under the Luxembourg draft, on certain basic legislation of political rather than technical import, the parliament would have equal law-making rights with the Council. If the two could not agree, a committee would try to conciliate. But the parliament could, in the end, kill EC laws.</p>

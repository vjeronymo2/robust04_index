			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / HK banks reject interest criticism Banks in Hong Kong yesterday hit back at a damning report from the Consumer Council - which claimed the colony's cartel on interest rates helped banks earn an extra HKDollars 5bn (Pounds 434m) in 1991 to the detriment of small depositors - by insisting the 30-year Interest Rate Agreement creates stability and that banks themselves lose a total of HKDollars 2.7bn serving the small savings customer, Louise Lucas writes from Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Association of Banks said the Interest Rate Agreement fostered stability by keeping interest rates in line with market forces and the government's economic policy - a need further underlined by the peg with the US dollar, which means Hong Kong interest rates must track those set by the US. However, the agreement pre-dates the peg by some 19 years.</p>

Gorbachev -- one of the biggest media events ever staged in Scandinavia.  </P> <P> Officials said 500 more journalists turned out for the hastily arranged one-day  summit than for the 1975 signing of the Helsinki Final Act that enshrines  international agreements on human rights, security and economic cooperation.  </P></p>

			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei down 13.2% in disappointing 1994 Dealer trading dominated yesterday's half-day session, and share prices sagged on the last trading day of the year on profit-taking, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 average ended 29.92 lower at 19,723.06, up 13.2 per cent on the year. The Topix index rose 4.75 to 1,559.09 and closed up 8.3 per cent from the end of last year. The Nikkei moved between 19,679.34 and 19,833.22 during the day, fluctuating on year end position adjustment by dealers. Volume totalled 120m shares against Thursday's 208m. The Nikkei 300 edged up 0.81 to 287.17. Gainers led losers by 570 to 390, with 176 shares remaining unchanged. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.90 to 1,287.92. While the performance of Japanese shares this year has disappointed many market participants who were expecting the Nikkei to rise as high as 25,000, returns have been favourable relative to other world-wide markets. The Nikkei has posted its first double digit gain for the first time since 1989 when the Nikkei rose by 29 per cent. Thanks to the yen's appreciation, in dollar terms, the Nikkei has gained 27 per cent and the Topix has risen by 21 per cent. The leading gainers of the year were cyclicals, with machinery up 30 per cent on the year, and other sectors including paper, steel and shipping showing strong performances. Utilities, metals, construction and foods were among the losers. Some analysts believe that a weak recovery will mean further room for strength in the manufacturing sector. 'If the current economic recovery were to follow previous cyclical patterns in the economy, the manufacturing-led recovery of 1994 would shift to a non-manufacturing led recovery in 1995,' said one. In Osaka, the OSE average closed up 73.22 to 21,702.45 in volume of 11.4m shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, fell Y110 to Y5,390 on profit-taking. Roundup Thin turnover characterised trading as the year closed. HONG KONG rounded off the year marginally lower on low turnover. The Hang Seng index fell 4.98 to 8,191.04 in turnover of HKDollars 1.31bn. The index lost 1.4 per cent on the week, but over the year fell 31.1 per cent, its the worst performance since 1982 when it lost 44.2 per cent. The index of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong closed at 1,069.67, up 5.24 mainly as a result of Japanese buying. The session also marked the final day's trading in Hong Kong of Jardine Matheson Holdings and Jardine Strategic Holdings, which have now moved their secondary listings to Singapore. Jardine Matheson lost 50 cents to HKDollars 55.25 and Jardine Strategic was down 80 cents at HKDollars 25.40. SYDNEY closed sharply lower in pre-holiday, half-day trading. The All Ordinaries index lost 20.1 to 1,912.7 in volume of 138m shares valued at ADollars 696m. The index was barely changed on the week. Brokers noted further profit-taking among resource issues following good gains in recent trading. BHP dropped 32 cents to ADollars 19.58, with CRA declining 18 cents to ADollars 17.80 and MIM Holdings off 9 cents to ADollars 2.15. SINGAPORE registered a new year's low in terms of volume traded at 43.1m shares as the Straits Times industrials index shed 3.46 to 2,239.56, a week's rise of 1 per cent. Most of the trade was accounted for by Malaysian shares dealt over the counter. TAIPEI was strong but brokers warned that the rally was based on speculative buying and could prove hard to sustain in the new year. The weighted index added 83.67 or 1.2 per cent to 7,111.10 for a week's improvement of 3.7 per cent. Turnover was TDollars 100.19bn. The market has been been among the region's best performers in 1994, showing an index gain of more than 17 per cent. China Airlines rose or 6.84 per cent to TDollars 48.4 on hopes that an imminent relaxation of visa rules for travel to Taiwan would boost passenger loads. KUALA LUMPUR closed slightly higher, with the composite index up 4.07 at 971.21, and down 1.7 per cent on the week. Turnover was MDollars 35.3m.</p>

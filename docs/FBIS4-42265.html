			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Stavros Liyeros: "The Uprooting of North </F> Ipiros Citizens"]    [Text] The new wave of arrests in North Ipiros proves that  the tension in the relations between Athens and Tirana is the  choice of the [Albanian President Sali] Berisha regime and not  just a result of mistrust. The incident at Episkopi was used as  a golden opportunity for the promotion of anti-Greek propaganda  and to justify preplanned persecutions against minority members.    If the first wave of arrests was done to discover some  evidence to support the claim about a Greek intervention, the  second wave of arrests had exclusively political aims. Tirana's  first aim is the cultivation of a climate of terror and fear  among the North Ipiros citizens to force them to flee. Tirana's  strategic aim is not the neutralization of any offensive  tendencies [by the Greek minority] but the uprooting of the  minority.    Tirana's stance toward the Greek minority is indirectly but  clearly connected with its demands in Kosovo. By showing its  own offensive ideology, Tirana is certain that Athens will make  the same demands on North Ipiros that it has made on Kosovo.  For this reason, Tirana seeks the expulsion of Greeks before  things reach the negotiating table.    All of the above is taking place during a time of economic  downfall, social degradation, and fanatic aggressiveness,  something that creates the conditions to channel the internal  crisis toward dangerous adventurism. That is why the  possibility that the Albanian side will launch a pogrom against  the Greek minority remains open. Athens has the obligation to  prevent it by making clear, well in advance, its decision not to  allow such a development.    Tirana's second aim, which is the destruction of bilateral  relations and the creation of an offensive climate to stop the  rise of the Greek-oriented conscience within significant parts  of the Orthodox Albanian or Albanian elements, is equally  important. This aggressiveness is not due to some unfounded  Greek propaganda but to the revival of Islam and discriminatory  feelings among the Orthodox Albanians. This is the reason why  the Berisha regime attacks Archbishop Anastasios with such  force, even though he is limited to his religious duties.</p>

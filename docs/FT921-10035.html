			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / International Company News: Honeywell wins Minolta case HONEYWELL, the US controls manufacturer, has been awarded Dollars 96m by a US jury for alleged violation of its autofocus camera patents by Minolta, the Japanese camera maker. The case, which had been dragging through the courts since 1987, had been portrayed by Honeywell as an important test case for American high technology industry, which the US government reckons could be losing up to Dollars 60bn a year through international piracy of its ideas. Yesterday's award by a jury in a New Jersey federal court was substantially smaller than Honeywell wanted, although it never put a precise figure on its claim. The jury also decided against applying triple damages, on the grounds that any infringement of the patent was not wilful. Minolta denied Honeywell's claims throughout The US company said it was delighted at the court's ruling and would immediately seek an injunction banning the sale in the US of Minolta cameras using the Honeywell technology. The aim would be to secure payment of the award and encourage Minolta to reach a licensing agreement. It would also put pressure for a settlement on 15 other Japanese companies with which it is in dispute over the autofocus technology. Minolta said it was gratified that the jury had rejected Honeywell's claims of wilful patent infringement and was reviewing its options where he court had found for Honeywell. The case stems from the invention by Honeywell in the 1960s and 1970s of autofocusing technology for single lens reflex cameras. Honeywell signed 'advance disclosure agreements' with Japanese companies in the late 1970s, giving them information which would allow them to incorporate the technology in their cameras. The US company claimed that the Minolta engineers involved in this set up a secret parallel programme to develop a substitute and thus avoid royalty payments. However, Minolta argued in court that Honeywell's patents were not valid and the unit at the heart of the contract claim was technically flawed.</p>

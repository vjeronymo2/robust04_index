			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SANTA PAULA;  </P> <P> HEARING FOCUSES ON LEVY TO SAVE OPEN SPACE  </P> <P> The Santa Paula City Council will hold a public hearing Monday on an assessment  district to maintain open space in the new Hillsborough tract.  </P> <P> The tract of upscale housing in north Santa Paula, where houses cost at least  $395,000, is in the first phase of construction.  </P> <P> The open space, including a flood-control basin and a grove of trees, must be  maintained under an agreement made between the developers and the city when the  69-house project was approved in 1988.  </P> <P> The cost of maintaining the basin and landscaping is to be borne by homeowners  in the tract. An assessment of about $100 annually would appear on the property  tax bill.  </P> <P> Wilkinson emphasized that surrounding homeowners would not pay for the proposed  assessment district.

All the negative  processes taking place in the Russian economy are also having an  effect on service. We have lost a number of military bases in  the Baltic, Black, and Caspian Seas, and attempts to play the  naval card are continuing in various political circles," Viktor  Chernomyrdin, Russian Federation Government prime minister,  stated on Sunday, taking part in the ceremony of the  commissioning in the Russian Navy of the first category  destroyer Besstrashnyy.</p>

			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Clinton lead stretched by primary victories GOVERNOR Bill Clinton yesterday took another step towards the Democratic party's presidential nomination, winning more delegates in primary voting and gaining the support of the US trade union movement, writes George Graham. Early returns and exit polls showed Mr Clinton soundly defeating former Californian Governor Jerry Brown in Democratic primaries in Indiana and North Carolina. He was also expected to win by substantial margins in the District of Columbia, where polls closed later. In Republican party primaries President George Bush was projected to have won in Indiana and to have scored a three-to-one victory over Mr Patrick Buchanan in North Carolina. With Mr Bush now mathematically assured of his party's nomination, and Mr Clinton more than 80 per cent of the way towards becoming the Democratic candidate, yesterday's primaries were fought with little fire. The endorsement of the AFL-CIO, the US trade union confederation, came as little surprise as the labour movement has endorsed every recent Democratic candidate except Mr George McGovern. But Mr Clinton has had his differences with the trade unions, notably over his support for the North American Free Trade Agreement which labour leaders believe will lead to US jobs being transferred to Mexico.</p>

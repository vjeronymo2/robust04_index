			<p>BFN     [Text] On 6 June, expert members of the working group on  "Import Promotion, Market Access Improvement, and Distribution"  of the government's Administrative Reform Promotion  Council(headed by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata), presented a  report recommending abolition or alleviation of Japan's unique  regulations as well as drastic reduction of gaps in commodity  prices between Japan and other countries to the cabinet minister  in charge of the group.    This means all three working groups under the council have  presented their reports. On deregulation of some individual  regulations, however, this last report presented dual  alternatives, leaving the government to make decisions on what  alternatives to choose.    The report was prepared by compiling the views of seven  expert members representing academic and economic circles, and  it recommends, among others: 1) Abolishing or easing Japan's  unique economic regulations; 2) adopting as a target the  reduction of gaps in commodity prices between Japan and other  countries by half; 3) abolishing or easing rules which impede  business operations; and 4) establishing without delay an  administrative reform committee without any present or former  bureaucrats represented on it.</p>

			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Equity Markets: Share prices focused on higher ground - London The stock market has turned highly volatile as the summer holidays - extended perhaps by the prolonged British Rail dispute - draw to a close. Although profit-taking in the wake of the latest upsurge has been modest and underlying retail business strong, there are signs this week could see a more penetrating review of market prospects. The interest rate outlook has hardened in Europe as the latest indications of strength in the German economy have suggested the trough of the rate cycle has been reached. In the UK, Wednesday's monthly meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, has already triggered alarm bells among market analysts. Some believe there is already a party in the City prepared to urge that base rates should be raised now, as a pre-emptive strike against an accelerating economy and hints of inflation. It was these concerns that kept the stock market hopping from one foot to another last week. Mr Richard Jeffrey at Charterhouse Tilney Securities points out that, while the chancellor will be politically wary of raising base rates, he has committed himself to having inflation below 2 1/2 per cent at the end of this parliament. 'If he fails, it will be seized upon . . . as a broken commitment,' says Mr Jeffrey. Since the City still believes that interest rate policy has been the key to keeping domestic inflation subdued, it is not surprising that market antennae are on the alert. However, there is still the question of whether a modest and controlled rise in base rates would stop a market now focused on the recovery in company profits and dividends. It seems clear that the equity market wants to go higher. Recent support has come from wholesale upgradings of bank and insurance companies, and also the 12 dividend reviews among electricity companies prompted by the favourable pricing review. NatWest Securities points out that, with the impetus from gilts now missing, maintained corporate earnings momentum is even more important for equities. Kleinwort Benson's Edmond Warner, agreeing that the interim reporting season has started in good form and is 'unlikely to shake prospects for this year', warns that 1995 expectations appear overblown. He says the strong list of profits upgrades in August, a reversal of the July trend, does not change his view that earnings will grow by only 10 per cent next year, which would be a disappointment for a consensus forecast of 13.6 per cent, according to a review by Legal &amp; General, but these medium term views will be swept aside if the conviction that some large takeover moves are in the offing prove true.</p>

			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Peres would talk to Jerusalem Arabs MR SHIMON Peres, Israeli foreign minister, said yesterday that he would not object to talking to Palestinians from east Jerusalem, AP reports from Jerusalem. The US administration has proposed that Israel accept Mr Faisal Husseini, a prominent east Jerusalem Arab, as head of the Palestinian negotiating team in order to coax Palestinians back to negotiations, set to resume in Washington. Mr Peres stressed on Israeli army radio that excluding Arab negotiators from Jerusalem was a policy of the previous, right-wing Likud government in Israel, which had argued that to talk with such people would mean conceding Israel's claim on the city. Mr Peres added that he has 'never ruled out Faisal Husseini.' He said that, 'on the ground, Faisal Husseini heads the Palestinian team. The Americans are speaking with him. We are not deaf or blind.' Mr Husseini, who has close ties to the Palestine Liberation Organisation, has been denied a formal role in the talks because Israel objects to sitting down with Arabs from Jerusalem. Reuter reports from Amman: Palestinian negotiators will meet US officials in Washington again before deciding whether to attend the next round of Middle East peace talks on April 20, the chief Palestinian delegate said yesterday. 'We will be leaving for Washington in mid-April for further discussions with the US administration on our requests,' Mr Haidar Abdel-Shafi said.</p>

			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Salomon loses Pounds 6.7m in fraud SALOMON Brothers, the US investment bank, said last night that its UK arm had suffered a Pounds 6.7m loss as a result of a fraud, Robert Peston writes. It said it had issued a writ against a clerical employee and had informed the London Metropolitan police, the Securities and Futures Association, regulator of the securities industry, and the Bank of England. Salomon said the fraud had taken place in the past few days, and that none of its clients had suffered losses. The only part of Salomon for which the Bank acts as supervisor is its gilt-edged marketmaker, which trades in UK government bonds and other debt instruments.</p>

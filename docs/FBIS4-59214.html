			<p>BFN     [Text] Some of the Golan Heights entrepreneurs and  investors are preparing to continue running their businesses  under Syrian sovereignty. Moreover, they say they have learned  that this issue was anchored in the proposals Israel has  submitted to Syria.    Investments amounting to hundreds of millions of shekels  continue to be made in the Golan Heights industry, agriculture,  and infrastructure. A major part of the investments come from  government funds.</p>

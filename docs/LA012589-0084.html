			<p><P> January 25, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> DELAY IN SALE OF BONDS DENIED  </P> <P> State Finance Director Jesse R. Huff disputed a published report that the  Deukmejian Administration has postponed selling more than $4 billion in newly  approved bond issues, insisting that bond sales are "proceeding on schedule."  "We are not delaying any bond sales. We are not stopping any projects for which  voters approved bonds," Huff said. Manuel M. Mateo, chief of the trust services  division in the treasurer's office, agreed. "We will sell bonds just as fast as  we legally can," he said. The Sacramento Bee reported that $4 billion in bonds  approved by voters last year are being delayed because the state would not have  enough money to make the principal or interest payments.  </P></p>

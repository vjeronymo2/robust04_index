			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / The Property Market: Why bricks are no longer bankable The collapse of the commercial property market in Britain has had an unusually wide airing in the media recently. But does it really matter to anyone who is not directly involved? The market's problems, it is sometimes argued, are solely the concern of overstretched developers, their banks and the property profession. But there is a strong case that a property crash on this scale has implications for the country as a whole. First, the sector's problems are very visible. The overbuilding of the late 1980s has left a trail of empty buildings in its wake. Cities are blighted by the empty hulks of dilapidated office blocks awaiting demolition, as redevelopment projects have become unviable. Rows of empty shops give town centres a neglected, depressed atmosphere, damaging the business of neighbouring retailers. But a second - and even more important - matter concerns the importance of property to banks and business. Three quarters of bank lending is dependent on property, says Mr Julian Robins, a banking analyst at BZW. 'The size of the banks' asset base which is reliant on property is mind-boggling.' This is illustrated by the striking relationship between the UK banks' bad debts and commercial property prices. The banks' exposure to property is three-fold: their own branches and offices; their loans to property companies; and as the security that underpins their loans. The falling value of property that is used as security is perhaps the most important aspect of this problem, although it is difficult to quantify so it is often ignored. 'This is potentially the largest and most frightening (threat), the one that gives bankers the biggest headaches,' says Mr Robins of BZW. The collapse in property prices affects the banks' ability to make new loans  -as it cuts into their capital base - and their willingness to do so. The UK banks play down the concern about a 'credit crunch' resulting from their difficulty in making new loans. 'It is an exaggeration,' says Mr Bruce Kensall, head of marketing and communications at Barclays. 'It is not the availability of money that is the problem but good opportunities to spend it,' he says. But there is no doubt that banks are being more cautious. 'One is being more discerning as a result of bad debts,' says Mr Kensall. The fall in asset values is an important ingredient of this cautious attitude. 'If asset prices fall, the collateral provided by these assets will diminish in quality and lending institutions may become increasingly reluctant to lend to companies, leading to a decline of investment, demand and output,' said a report by the London Business School last year. 'The banks are frightened of lending on collateral,' says Mr Robins. 'This factor is having a huge effect on new lending.' The Forum of Private Business, a lobby group for small businesses agrees. 'Falling property prices are having a sizeable impact,' says its spokesman Mr David Harrop. For the most part, the problem is confined to new loans. But in some cases, banks are accused of pulling in existing loans, when the loan covenant has been breached as a result of a fall in asset value. Banks stress that they are not looking for excuses to call in loans if there is a prospect of a company covering its interest payments. Moreover, the slump in the market means that a forced sale of a property would often not recoup the value of the loan. (On average, this would happen with a fall of more than 30 per cent of the property's value.) Businesses do not necessarily take solace from this point. They fear that loans will be called in when the market recovers. Moreover, they fear that banks are demanding extra security to cover themselves against falling asset prices. 'Bank managers say they need more security. But as soon as they have more security to make sure the loan is covered, they call it in. There is a lot of sharp practice,' says Mr Stephen Alambritis of the Federation of Small Businesses. But there is a silver lining of sorts for some businesses. The landlords' problems represents opportunities for their tenants. While tenants locked into upwards-only leases are benefiting little from the property recession, those seeking new premises have low costs and an exceptionally wide choice on offer.</p>

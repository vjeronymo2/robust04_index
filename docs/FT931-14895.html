			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Birkdale falls Pounds 494,000 into red and buys 80% stake in consultancy THE BIRKDALE group, which runs a range of marketing, advertising and public relations agencies, incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 494,000 for the six months ended September 30. That compared with profits of Pounds 64,000 previously and was struck from turnover down almost 10 per cent at Pounds 9.5m. Losses per share emerged at 2.9p (earnings of 0.5p). The group's net average debt currently stands at Pounds 1m. The fall in turnover was largely in line with the results across most of the advertising and marketing sector, as the recession hit budgets everywhere. Mr Neil McClure, managing director, said that far from losing clients the group had in fact gained new business, with prestigious accounts from British Airways (for its international recruitment advertising), Cunard, Cadbury and elsewhere. However, the recession meant that existing and new clients had tightened all budgets, including marketing. 'At the moment we can see some signs of a recovery but all we can say so far is that 1993 is not going to be worse than 1992,' he added. The group had cut staff levels by about 9 per cent to 270 in the past six months and board directors had taken pay cuts of 20 per cent; Mr Richard Humphreys, chief executive, takes no salary from the group. Mr McClure said that the group's emphasis had been on maintaining itself in good financial and creative shape in order to take advantage of the recovery, when it arrives. He also reported the acquisition by Birkdale of 80 per cent of the shares of MSL, the London-based marketing consultancy, for a maximum consideration of Pounds 365,000, financed by Birkdale shares and a one-year deferred payment.</p>

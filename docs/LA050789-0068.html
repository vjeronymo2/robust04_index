			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO MELTING POT;  </P> <P> EUROPE BUSY CLOSING DOOR TO FOREIGNERS  </P> <P> They come at night, braving the treacherous strait in leaky 20-foot fishing  boats called pateras.  </P> <P> Paying up to $1,700 for the nine-mile illegal crossing to Europe's southernmost  tip, many Moroccans ante up their life savings, gambling on a brighter future  in a land rich beyond their dreams.  </P> <P> Occasionally, winds and currents in the Strait of Gibraltar swamp the  overloaded boats, tipping their human cargoes into the sea and almost-certain  death.  </P> <P> Occasionally, the Moroccans are caught by Spanish authorities and returned.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Networks of Smugglers  </P> <P> But with luck, they reach the shadowy networks that smuggle them to Madrid, to  the French border and to menial black market jobs in the inner cities of  northern Europe.  </P> <P> Algeciras Police Chief Javier Fernandez calls them espaldas mojadas --  literally, those with wet backs -- and says it is almost impossible to stop  them completely.  </P> <P> "The coast is too wide and we are too few," he said, shrugging.  </P> <P> Their numbers -- hundreds each week, according to most estimates -- are small  compared to the 850,000 Mexicans caught attempting to cross illegally into the  United States last year.  </P> <P> But for a continent where people already feel overwhelmed by a rising tide of  immigrants, refugees and asylum-seekers, they add a worrisome dimension to a  serious problem.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Multicultural Europe  </P> <P> Western Europe's social democracies are only now digesting the sobering fact  that most of the estimated 10 million to 15 million foreigners among them are  no longer foreigners but part of a new multicultural, multiracial,  multireligious Europe.  </P> <P> The presence of these outsiders, the majority of whom arrived legally and by  invitation, represents one of the most fundamental and deep-seated social  changes in Europe since World War II.  </P> <P> Certainly Europe is accustomed to immigrants and refugees. Its catalogue of  wars, revolutions and persecutions has seen to that. But the resettlement of  large numbers of non-Europeans is a new and unsettling phenomenon.  </P> <P> Consider, for example, that:  </P> <P>  -- By 1995, every second child born in Brussels, the self-proclaimed capital  of Europe, will be Arab.  </P> <P>  -- Twice as many Britons speak Urdu, Punjabi or Gujarati as Welsh, the native  language of Wales.  </P> <P>  -- In France, an estimated 700,000 Arabs will be eligible to vote in the next  presidential election, a number nearly twice as large as the margin that  separated the candidates in the 1974 presidential election.  </P> <P>  -- In West Berlin, three of the city's television stations now broadcast in  Turkish.  </P> <P>  -- In Spain, road signs have appeared in Arabic to ease confusion among the  estimated three-quarters of a million Moroccans who cross the country every  summer on vacation trips from cities to the north.  </P> <P> For a part of the world whose principal experience with non-Christians has been  in religious wars and colonial exploitation, the ramifications of this  population shift are considerable -- and occasionally disquieting.  </P> <P> Protests surrounding Salman Rushdie's novel "The Satanic Verses," the death  threat against Rushdie by Iran's supreme leader, the Ayatollah Ruhollah  Khomeini, and the subsequent assassination of a leading Muslim clergyman in  Brussels sent shock waves across the Continent.  </P> <P> "The Rushdie affair," Britain's Home Secretary Timothy Renton commented in an  interview, "is a new dimension for a lot of people who haven't really thought  about . . . the idea that a distant prophet, a religious leader, can lay down a  fiat, a law that Muslims throughout Europe can take as a binding commandment. .  . ."  </P> <P> Aside from adding to social tension, what West Europeans call "the foreigners  issue" has complicated European attempts at unity, tilted the political  equation in several countries, raised questions about the future role of the  Continent's generous but hard-pressed welfare states, influenced demographic  trends and begun to change the way Western Europe views itself as a society.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rooted in Economic Boom  </P> <P> Paradoxically, Europe's problem is rooted in its post-World War II economic  recovery. To ease crippling manpower shortages that threatened to strangle the  boom of the late 1950s and early 1960s, governments and large corporations  recruited cheap, unskilled labor abroad.  </P> <P> With the lure of a quick fortune, Turkish "guest workers" arrived to sweep  streets of Geneva or build Volvos in Goteborg, Sweden, at wage levels they had  only dreamed of. Moroccans and Tunisians came to dig coal in French Lorraine or  stoke the coking ovens of West Germany's Ruhr region.  </P> <P> Leaders of Britain's textile industry, in order to remain competitive, did not  buy costly machines but recruited cheap Pakistani labor to work the old ones.  Jamaicans answered ads in Kingston newspapers and took jobs driving London's  buses, trains and subways.  </P> <P> In more recent years, large numbers of illegal laborers, mainly from North  Africa, slipped into Spain and Italy and found work picking grapes and in  construction.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Influx From 'Colonies'  </P> <P> Adding to the influx, war and unrest in formerly colonial areas brought in  hundreds of thousands of additional refugees in the 1960s and early 1970s.  </P> <P> By the time the oil crisis pitched Europe into recession in the mid-1970s, many  guest workers had established roots, brought wives and started families.  </P> <P> Gradually, dreams of going home began to fade. And only then did the long-term  implications of Europe's massive recruitment begin to dawn on its  policy-makers.  </P> <P> Today, in an atmosphere where individual countries are desperately trying to  close their doors to more outsiders, "the foreigners issue" has complicated  European Community efforts to dismantle by 1992 the checkpoints on borders  dividing its member nations.  </P> <P> "There are few issues in Europe more challenging," said C. D. de Jong, a senior  official in the Dutch Ministry of Justice. "We're doing a lot of thinking."  </P> <P> So are many others. Right-wing parties that appeal to anti-immigrant sympathies  have sprouted in several countries, including West Germany, France,  Switzerland, Denmark, Norway and Belgium.  </P> <P> In recent West Berlin municipal elections, a party headed by a former member of  the Nazi SS shocked political observers by taking advantage of an  anti-immigrant backlash and winning 7% of the vote, enough to topple a  coalition headed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats.  </P> <P> A few weeks later, an election in Frankfurt produced a similar result.  </P> <P> In a country that recently coined the word ueberfremdung, which means  "overwhelmed by foreigners," the same issue could decide who will be chancellor  after next year's national elections.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Extreme Right Reacts  </P> <P> In France, Jean-Marie Le Pen's National Front revived the country's extreme  right with the simple message that France's 5 million residents of foreign  origin must either become completely assimilated or go.  </P> <P> Le Pen collected more than 4 million votes in last year's presidential election  on that theme, and from his hillside chateau on the western outskirts of Paris,  he recently launched, with the same idea, his party's campaign for June's  European Parliament elections.  </P> <P> "The call for Europe is to defend the historic, ethnic, cultural and spiritual  identity of the European people," he declared.  </P> <P> The idea that 350 million West Europeans could feel overwhelmed by a minority  population representing barely 4% of their total number seems a puzzling  overreaction. Ethnic and racial minorities make up roughly five times that  percentage of the U.S. population.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Explosive Combination  </P> <P> But in Europe, the concentration of minorities in large urban areas, together  with intense competition for social services and jobs, makes for a potentially  volatile political cocktail.  </P> <P> In a region where indigenous populations have begun declining, high birthrates  among minorities inject additional fears of being overwhelmed.  </P> <P> "Europe is subjected to a threat from the demographics of the Third World and  Islamic expansionism," Le Pen said.  </P> <P> But most important, Europe, unlike the United States, has developed no melting  pot to immerse new arrivals in its culture. Its instinct has been to isolate  rather than absorb new minorities.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Citizenship Strictures  </P> <P> In some instances, access to citizenship in Europe has been tightened. Official  discrimination is often demoralizing.  </P> <P> A West German-born son of Turkish parents living in the country for 20 years  may yearn to be like his peers, but he has no automatic right to citizenship,  and his special "foreigner status" prevents him, among other things, from  becoming a public servant, a doctor, a pharmacist, a policeman or even a  railroad locomotive driver.  </P> <P> "Second-generation youngsters want to be the same as German kids -- study, play  and dream of a future, but everywhere there are limits," said Barbara John, who  runs an immigrant assistance office for the West Berlin city government. "If we  don't open up and become more flexible, there's a danger of real difficulties."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Immigration Cut Sharply  </P> <P> Except for family unification, European governments have virtually ended  immigration from Third World countries. (Immigration from Eastern Europe,  however, has increased sharply amid a more relaxed East-West climate, with  about 200,000 East Europeans arriving to resettle in West Germany alone last  year.) Authorities also scrutinize refugees and political asylum-seekers from  outside Europe far more closely than in the past.  </P> <P> In most countries, acceptance rates for political asylum-seekers have dropped  from between 80% and 90% in the mid-1970s to around 10% today. Some refugee aid  groups fear that tough new European Community proposals could effectively shut  the door completely.  </P> <P> People dealing with caseloads say the shift reflects not so much a hardening of  criteria as a new breed of applicant -- one not fleeing political persecution  but seeking a better life style.  </P> <P> But they admit that the public mood also plays a role.  </P> <P> "It is a fact of life that (our) society wants us to say no," said De Jong, the  Dutch Justice Ministry official.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Strengthening Frontiers  </P> <P> As the European Community's 12 member states work to dismantle their internal  frontiers, the debate centers on how -- not whether -- to strengthen the  Community's frontiers with the rest of the world.  </P> <P> In the corridors at EC headquarters in Brussels, immigrants are a problem  usually lumped together with drug-runners and terrorists on the list of  headaches. Visa requirements have already been tightened, making visits by  foreigners' families more difficult to achieve.  </P> <P> In Madrid, Spanish officials talk of a new coast guard service to crack down on  illegal immigrants. They say that beginning next year Moroccans entering Spain  legally will be required to have visas, return tickets and minimum funds for  their European stay. Some predict that this will bring chaos.  </P> <P> "We're under a lot of pressure from the other (EC) countries to resolve this,"  said Aquilino Gonzalez, a senior official in the Spanish Interior Ministry. "If  the door is open in one of the 12, it's open in all 12."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Second-Class Rights  </P> <P> For foreigners already resident here, the discussions have raised the prospect  that they will find themselves with a form of second-class rights in a  post-1992, border-free Europe.  </P> <P> At present, an Algerian legally a resident in France has as much access to the  French job market as his French counterpart, but if present EC thinking  prevails, he could be blocked from joining his French counterpart on a transfer  to work in Britain.  </P> <P> "What 1992 represents is a transformation of nationalism into a white  continentalism, altogether more tight, resilient and with more power," said  Christopher Mullard, a professor at the University of Amsterdam.  </P> <P> When Europe sent out a call for guest workers in the 1950s and 1960s, "no one  placed any limits on the residence of those recruited," noted Lutz R. Voss, a  senior official in the West Berlin Internal Affairs Department. "People just  assumed the guest workers would return (home) after a few years, so officials  didn't even think along those lines."  </P> <P> They do now.  </P> <P> With Western Europe struggling as hard today against unemployment as it once  did to recruit labor, several governments have offered lucrative incentives to  persuade these workers to go home.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Return Fare Offered  </P> <P> The Netherlands has even offered to pay the return fare for unemployed  immigrants, then send them Dutch social security benefits once they get there.  </P> <P> Some have gone, but far more have stayed.  </P> <P> In Britain and, to a lesser extent, France, social tensions have boiled over  into street violence. Bitter riots in London and some northern English cities  earlier in this decade shocked British authorities into drawing up one of the  Continent's few race-relations programs.  </P> <P> In most countries, however, community relations are characterized more by  mutual suspicion, subtle discrimination and low-grade hostility.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bitter Reaction  </P> <P> "Once we were well-liked; we helped build the 'economic miracle,' " recalled  Serdar Yilmaz, a 26-year-old Turkish-born travel agent who, as a child,  followed his father to West Berlin 20 years ago. "Now, people see there are 2  million unemployed and 4 million foreigners and say, 'Just ship 'em home.' "  </P> <P> Azeddine Guessous, Morocco's ambassador to Spain, said: "These countries came  to recruit workers for their boom and recovery, but the moment there are  problems, the first victims are those who contributed most. We don't think it's  just."  </P> <P> But any serious discussion of repatriating Europe's foreigners has long since  been overtaken by the fact that to an increasing extent they are no longer  foreign.  </P> <P> French sociologist Juliette Minces estimates that at least 60% of the people  with North African roots living in France and widely viewed as immigrants, are,  in fact, French-born.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Feel They Belong  </P> <P> "They feel this is where they belong," she said.  </P> <P> In Britain, roughly half the nonwhite population was born in the British Isles,  and two-thirds of West Germany's 1.5 million Turks are under 16.  </P> <P> But for Europe's new minorities, there are also some reasons for optimism.  </P> <P> Nonwhites now appear in British television ads, an important development,  according to civil rights groups, because many rural Britons have had no  contact at all with minorities.  </P> <P> In Britain and France, where an earlier, more liberal attitude provided  generations of colonials with citizenship, minority groups have created voting  muscle.  </P> <P> In Britain's 1987 general election, four nonwhite candidates, including the  first black woman, won seats in the House of Commons; while in France,  second-generation North Africans, called Beurs, achieved a major success by  winning more than 500 of the 36,000 seats in municipal elections last year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Breakthrough in France  </P> <P> "It is an important breakthrough," said Arezki Dahmani, president of France  Plus, an immigrant-rights organization. "It means France has accepted our  permanence."  </P> <P> Such public figures also provide important role models for a generation bereft  of cultural signposts. Some have even had the temerity to suggest that their  heritage has something to offer Europe.  </P> <P> In an interview with French television, Koshi Yamgnage, a Togo-born engineer  recently elected mayor of the small Breton village of St. Coulitz, explained  why he consulted so many residents before making decisions that other  politicians might make on their own.  </P> <P> "For me, it's not possible to take an important decision without consulting the  people," he said. "It comes from my African culture."  </P> <P> Times researcher Christine Courtney contributed to this article.  </P></p>

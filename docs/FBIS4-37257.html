			<p>BFN     [Text] We have just received this news report. A  responsible source at the Ministry of Defense of the Democratic  Republic of Yemen has categorically denied the report carried by  the news media of the ruling military regime in Sanaa this  evening that our military aircraft raided the city of  al-Hudaydah and bombed the electricity-generating station at  Mocha. The source confirmed that this report has absolutely no  truth and is part of the cheap misleading information for which  the stooges of the ruling military regime in Sanaa and their  other news media have become famous for. This is known to  everyone in the two parts of Yemen and, indeed, in the Arab  homeland and the entire world.    The responsible source warned that this media report carried  by the Sanaa media could be a new pretext to continue the  shelling of the economic installations as well as the peaceful  residential quarters in the Aden Governorate. The ruling  military regime has grown accustomed to this recently after  failing to achieve the strategic and military objectives of the  war. This is a matter on which we cannot remain silent and it  will be confronted with force.</p>

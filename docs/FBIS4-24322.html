			<p>BFN     [Text] Internal Affairs Minister Samuel Dhokie, as part of  his clandestine operation to launch an attack on positions of  the NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia], is reported to  have visited Guinea. Mr. Samuel Dhokie, according to reports,  visited Guinea to seek cooperation from local Guinean  authorities for the use of Guinean soil for his planned attack,  under the guise of arranging the repatriation of Liberian  refugees there. But he is reported to have been refused any  cooperation from the Guinean Government.    The NPFL controversial nominee to the Liberian National  Transitional Government, who cut short his trip to Guinea as a  result of the refusal of authorities there to cooperate with  him, visited many refugee camps seeking support for his  so-called Nimba Defense Force. Observers are questioning the  credibility of Minister Dhokie and his cohorts, accusing them of  working contrary to the social peace of Liberia and their  original organizations that nominated them. There are even  calls for their replacement.</p>

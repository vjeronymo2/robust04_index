			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Riccardo Luna: "Objective: Popular Party and </F> Life Senators"]    [Text] Rome -- "The first thing to do to win the Senate's  approval is not to go before the Senate. That is, not to go  before the Senate until we have obtained a vote of confidence  from the lower house." This was said by Giulio Maceratini,  leader of the National Alliance's [AN] 48-strong caucus in the  Senate. Who said right-wingers are conservative? In order to  create the new government they are even willing to abandon the  tradition whereby prime ministers-designate present their  executives in alternation to both houses of parliament.    This time it is supposed to be the Senate's turn. On paper,  the majority lacks sufficient seats in the Senate to govern.  And so? "So traditions are made to be broken," Maceratini said.  Together with Forza Italia's group leader, attorney Cesare  Previti, Maceratini was one of the architects of Carlo  Scognamiglio's election to the speakership of the Senate.    "In any case," Maceratini concluded, "I do not consider this  custom of alternation so important." So "allies permitting, and  with the agreement of the parliamentary speakers, Mr. Berlusconi  will approach the lower house first and will address us Senators  only after he has obtained the expected approval of the  deputies."    Will the impetus of the lower house vote be enough to secure  the approval of the Senate, too? Operation Senators started  after Berlusconi's announcement ("I will address parliament  Thursday [12 May]"): The majority is three votes short of a  majority. The Freedom Alliance has 156 elected senators out of  315. "But there are also 11 life senators," Massimo Palombi,  elected in Rome for the Christian Democratic Center, said.  "Last time, in the vote on Scognamiglio, they all voted in  favor, apart from Giovanni Leone, who voted for Spadolini, but  that was only out of personal friendship. Now, however, the  establishment of the government is at stake, and it will be  different."    Which life senators might grant Berlusconi their support?  Gianni Agnelli, for one: He has already made it known that, if  absolutely necessary, he will not withhold his vote. And the  same goes for former President Francesco Cossiga, whose  sympathies for Berlusconi and [AN leader] Fini are well known.    But Forza Italia is hoping that Giulio Andreotti and  Amintore  Fanfani, physical ailments notwithstanding, will also attend the  Senate in its hour of need. Then there is Emilio Taviani, and  many people remember that Silvio Berlusconi's first official  move as prime minister-designate was in fact a courtesy visit to  the octogenarian senator. Did he persuade him to grant him his  vote of confidence?    It goes without saying that a majority established on this  basis is anything but a solid one. This is why Forza Italia's  strategists are gazing longingly at the senators. They  certainly will not receive the votes of the independents, who  will make Berlusconi pay for the presence of AN ministers in key  posts. Nor that of the Pact's Pietro Berlingeri, whom his party  colleagues describe as "a person of integrity, who certainly  will not sell out."    That leaves the 30 senators of the Italian Popular Party  [PPI]. "It is there that the possibilities exist," Maceratini  smiled smugly, hinting at the effectiveness of the  behind-the-scenes work that has been going on over the past few  days. In fact, the results are already apparent, and the  Ligurian, Luigi Grillo, already heads what appears to be an  outright PPI splinter group: six senators who are willing to  vote for Berlusconi.    "I am no turncoat," Grillo said in self-defense in an  interview with PANORAMA. "My decision is the result of strict  reasoning. The old DC [Christian Democratic Party] committed  every possible mistake. Now the PPI must avoid the last and  most serious mistake -- that of putting itself in a corner by  refusing to understand what has happened in the country." So  Berlusconi will also receive votes from Grillo himself, from  Aldo De Gaudenz from Trent, Tommaso Zanoletti from Piedmont, and  another three as yet unnamed senators. What if that is still not  enough? Then there is a solution put forward by PPI floor  leader Mancino. "Nicola [Mancino]," Grillo said, "raised the  idea at our meetings that if two or three votes are lacking,  that same number of PPI senators could leave the chamber, thus  permitting the majority to be achieved."</p>

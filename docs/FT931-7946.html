			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Construction Contracts: Apartments in Abu Dhabi Following six months of negotiations, JOHN LELLIOTT INTERNATIONAL has been awarded two overseas contracts approaching Pounds 100m. The first is for the construction of a 24-storey luxury development on the Abu Dhabi Cornishe. The project, valued at Pounds 60m consists of 20 levels of apartments, four levels of retail space and four levels of underground car parking, was negotiated with representatives of His Highness Sheikh Saife bin Mohamed Al Nahyan. Negotiations continue for a second project in Abu Dhabi for a 22-storey block of offices in Hamdan Street valued at Pounds 40m. Lelliott attribute their success in part to a pioneering approach to the design of the project using fast track techniques based on the use of a steel structure, a method of construction little in evidence in the UAE in recent years.

The second contract is a resort development in St Lucia, West Indies, where agreement has been concluded with New Century Developments Inc, New York, US, in respect of a hotel, casino, golf course and villa complex valued at USDollars 49m (Pounds 33.8m).

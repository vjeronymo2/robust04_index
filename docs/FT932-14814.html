			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / UK Company News: US withdrawal costs leave Alex Russell in red The cost of its final withdrawal from US coal production put Alexander Russell, the Scottish quarrying, concrete and coal group, into a Pounds 1.93m pre-tax loss in 1992, against a Pounds 1.66m profit previously. A one-off charge of Pounds 2.56m related to closure of the coal operation in Southern Illinois and any foreseeable costs linked to the withdrawal. The final dividend was passed, restricting the total to 1p (2.15p). Turnover fell to Pounds 36.5m (Pounds 37.6m) including Pounds 802,000 (Pounds 1.49m) from discontinued operations. Losses per share were 11.86p basic (2.59p earnings) and 8.26p (3.32p earnings) diluted.</p>

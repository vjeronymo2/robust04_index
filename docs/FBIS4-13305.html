			<p>BFN     [Text] Answering questions by AL-AHALI, Dr. Mansur Khalid,  political adviser to the southern commander John Garang, said  that the Sudanese People's Liberation Movement [SPLM] has not  asked for the intervention of foreign armies in Sudan. However,  he said that there are logistical problems hindering the  transport of relief aid, particularly in the areas where  fighting is raging. There is a need for guarantees to provide  supplies to these areas. Sudan is not Somalia, he said, but it  does not differ from Bosnia or Cambodia. A foreign presence to  guarantee these humanitarian matters could be provided through  the OAU or the United Nations. He said: We cannot request this  of the Arab League because it deals with Sudan as if it were not  part of the Arab nation.    Khalid said that Egypt is in constant contact with all  Sudanese parties and that it has never ceased its contacts. He  noted that the Egyptian Government can play an effective role in  the Sudanese problem on the regional and African levels in its  capacity as an Arab country and chairman of the OAU.    Khalid said that the talk about relations between the SPLM  and Israel does not deserve a reply. He said that the SPLM does  not need advisers from Israel or any other country, noting that  Israel has no experience in guerrilla warfare. He said that the  Sudanese Government's allegation that the SPLM has relations  with Israel is meaningless and untrue. It says this when  everyone is seeking Israel's favor. He noted that the parties  with which the SPLM cooperate are well known and are mostly  African. John Garang, he said, completed a guerrilla course as  a Sudanese Army soldier while on scholarship in the United  States.</p>

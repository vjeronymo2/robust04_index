			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Ivan Ivanov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 20 Jan -- The processes of reform in Russia  are irreversible -- we will not turn back or retreat from the  reforms -- Viktor Chernomyrdin told today's news conference at  the government press center, in answer to questions from  journalists. He stressed that, regardless of individual  political personalities, nothing will change in the  implementation of economic reforms.    The prime minister recalled that the reforms in Russia  continued even after 14 December 1992, when Yegor Gaydar left  the government, and again after his return to the Cabinet in  September 1993. They will continue irrespective of the fact  that he has now left the government again, he assured his  audience.    Journalists were, no doubt, most interested to hear about  Boris Fedorov's future. In response to numerous questions about  this, Chernomyrdin repeated that Fedorov's reply to the  invitation to head the Ministry of Finance had not so far been  received. He also noted that if the invitation were turned  down, someone else would be found instead.    Journalists reminded the prime minister that recently  Fedorov  made his acceptance of the post of Minister of Finance  conditional on the dismissal of Viktor Gerashchenko, chairman of  the Central Bank of Russia. In this connection, Chernomyrdin  said that no conditions from anybody were accepted when the  cabinet changes were made. He added that candidates for the  chairmanship of the Central Bank of Russia had to be examined  and endorsed by the president and parliament. For my part I see  no reason, at the moment, why Gerashchenko should not keep his  post, the prime minister said.    Touching on the fate of Ella Pamfilova, minister of social  protection, who has submitted her resignation, Chernomyrdin said  that: Her resignation has not been accepted. She is on ordinary  leave at present. If she does not wish to work in the  government, the question of who will head this ministry will be  decided in the first 10 days of February, the head of the  Cabinet said.    Speaking of the alterations in the structure of the Russian  Government, Chernomyrdin stressed in particular that: They are  not connected with specific individuals but are dictated by the  tasks that at present face the Cabinet of Ministers. In order  to raise the efficiency of the government's work, the number of  members of the government has been reduced from 93 to 29;  chairmen of state committees are no longer members of the  Cabinet. The number of deputy prime ministers has been reduced  from nine to four.    Replying to a question about the controversy over the  construction of a new building for the Russian Parliament,  Chernomyrdin said that so far the government has only taken the  decision to study the possibility of constructing such a  building and that no one had determined that this work would  cost $5 million. If both chambers of parliament come out against  the construction then it will not take place. But I support the  position that a specialized building for parliament is  essential, he made clear.    Concerning Western assistance for Russian reforms,  Chernomyrdin acknowledged that this factor could not be ignored.  However, Russia must count on its own efforts above all. No  assistance will provide a cardinal solution to our problems, the  prime minister stated.</p>

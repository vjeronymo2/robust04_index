			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Arts: Today's Television For decades the received wisdom in Britain has been that American television is rubbish but that, thanks to the Hollywood film tradition, they have a flair for action drama series and also manage ensemble sitcoms quite well. Yet in fact, from the days of 'The Twilight Zone', American television has always been remarkably good at fantasy and science fiction, and although British television succeeded with 'The Avengers' and 'Dr Who' in the 1960s, it has not produced anything memorable in this category recently. The American series Quantum Leap (9.00 BBC2) about a man who inhabits the bodies of others, is unfortunately inconsistent. Dream On (11.35 C4) is a modern American sitcom which does not depend upon ensemble playing but upon the talents of Brian Benben. He plays a New York publisher with an extensive fantasy life manifested mainly as memories of 1950s television series. This programme nails another myth by being far more daring sexually than any British comedy series. BBC1 goes back to 1975 for a memorable British comedy: The Good Life (8.00) .</p>

			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: UK economy The Bank of England points in its inflation report to the disparity between the government's inflation target and inflationary expectations implicit in gilts prices. Whether these expectations are measured by extrapolating the course of short term rates from the yield curve or through the yield difference between index-linked and conventional gilts, they do not suggest the public has enduring faith in the authorities' anti-inflation stance. The bank's rather feeble re-sponse is that this could change over time if inflation stays within target. A gradual decline in inflationary expectations would certainly help the government's massive funding programme. This year, inflation should be well within range. Next year looks a closer call, partly because the imposition of VAT on fuel will add 0.4 per cent to retail prices. It would help if companies relied on volume increases to improve their profits in the recovery, rather than pushing up their margins at the first sign of increasing demand. There is some chance of this, both because capacity use remains low and because manufacturers' margins held up relatively well during the recession. Even so the message is one of need for vigilance. The shape of the yield curve suggests a marginal fall in inflationary expectations since the Bank's last report. But while monetary policy has to bear the brunt of the battle against inflation, there is precious little room for lower interest rates. That could turn out awkwardly if the market does require a steeper yield curve to absorb all the gilts on offer.</p>

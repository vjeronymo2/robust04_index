			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Management: Just like Mamma used to make - Haig Simonian finds local fare reigns supreme when Italian businessmen eat out Untouched by political corruption scandals, recession and Mafia murders, the business lunch is alive and well in Italy. In Milan, the country's business capital, companies may be tightening their financial belts, yet corporate midday eating remains a tradition. But unlike some of Italy's north European neighbours, the stress is as much on 'lunch' as on 'business'. The hard bargaining will have already taken place in the office or will be reserved for a post-prandial contest. By contrast, lunch represents an agreeable truce, a pleasant way of sizing up the opposition or having a good gossip with colleagues outside HQ. Although executives have grown more conscious of their waistlines than in the pasta-guzzling past, quality remains paramount. Italian businessmen are likely to be as concerned about the preparation of their toadstool-sized portion of branzino (sea-bass) as they were with the consistency of the gorgonzola sauce on their gnocci a decade ago. Business diners are conservative, patronising a handful of places they know well, rather than experimenting. Moreover, Milan's legendary work ethic (which is true only by Italian standards) means people prefer to eat within walking distance of the office rather than taking a cab. Gastronomic expeditions tend to be left for the evening or weekends. Likewise, meals tend to grow longer the further south one heads. Times are another big national difference. While northern lunches will invariably start around one - or half an hour later at a pinch - that is still early for Rome, where most restaurants would barely be starting to fill up, with the real rush after two. Times for dinner differ accordingly. But one factor is constant irrespective of location. In a country where inebriation is definitely brutta figura (bad form), alcohol consumption, especially at midday, is moderate. Familiarity with a restaurant means diners often forego the menu and look to the head waiter, always addressed informally, for guidance instead. Though usually genuine, the technique is sometimes just a sham to impress the unknowing. The gradual shift towards 'healthier' eating has put a premium on fish. Surprisingly, Milan, although about as far as any Italian can get from the sea without crossing into Switzerland, is one of the best places to eat it. The city's fabled fish market is a clearing house for the country's catches, meaning that the chances of finding fresh fish are as high - if not higher - than in many coastal resorts. However, even the most diet-conscious executives are grasping that eating fish, invariably dearer than meat, has its price. Italy is no longer the bargain basement of many first-time visitors' dreams, and Milan is easily its most costly city. So the bill for a small, albeit tasty, filet of a pricey catch like sea-bass can be upsetting. And when served by weight, as is often the case, the bill can be shockingly high. Emerging from one of the city's big-name restaurants like Savini, Don Lisander or Alfio for less than L100,000 (Pounds 46.79) a head is a considerable achievement. In spite of healthier eating, some factors remain constant. First, you can safely assume that any corporate meal will be Italian. The number of foreign restaurants in Milan especially has crept up of late. Some, like Suntory, Rasa Sayang or Royal Dynasty, are sufficiently up-market to tempt the business luncher. Yet if the diners - or at least the hosts - are Italians, you can bet your next pay rise that local fare is what you'll get. The stress on things domestic stretches to wine. It is hard to find a restaurant, even top-notch, offering anything but home growths. A few of the most upmarket places may stretch to some French vintages, but thirsty Spaniards or Germans hankering for a familiar tipple will be disappointed. Some Italians complain that the rise of city centre expense-account dining has been the bane of thousands of sleepy, traditional trattorias, turning them into the cool, antiseptic eateries that now dominate corporate dining in much of northern Italy, notably Milan. For once a respectable trattoria has started making big money, out goes the old wood-panelling and in come the ubiquitous grey or white tiles, forecourt halogen lighting and pine furniture. Although uninviting, that ambience is a magnet for many well-travelled younger executives, or older colleagues who want to promote a more cosmopolitan image. Peck in Milan, with one Michelin rosette, typifies the look. But regional allegiances are still sufficiently strong for many businessmen to opt for tradition and choose a restaurant specialising in dishes from their local area. Milanese wanting to strike a balance between good food and a solid, but not stuffy, atmosphere often go to Boeucc, a big, efficient but attractive restaurant that is expensive enough to impress without being outrageous. Seasonal variations are also much more noticeable in Italy than most European countries. Choosing a heavy stew, or kidneys, traditionally served with polenta - a leaden maize-based potato substitute - would be a gaffe in a stiffling Milanese summer. Likewise, ordering a strong red Barolo in mid-July is not recommended, even in Turin, the capital of Piedmont where it is grown. Choosing local dishes is a sure way to impress one's host, but newcomers needn't exaggerate.</p>

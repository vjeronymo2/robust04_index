			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / International Company News: Reynolds to make aluminium vehicle parts REYNOLDS Metals, third-largest of the world's aluminium groups, is to spend Dollars 26m on a plant at Auburn, Indiana, to produce aluminium extruded components for the automotive industry, writes Kenneth Gooding. Technology for the components - bumper systems, door intrusion beams and sun-roof tracks - was developed at Reynolds' Netherlands plant. Several employees will be transferred from there to the new facility in the US, due to start up late next year. Reynolds and other western world aluminium companies see the automotive industry as a key market. Mr Richard Holder, chairman, said recently forecasts predicted the aluminium content of the average US car would more than double in five years from 170lbs to 350lbs.</p>

			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / GPA Group - The Refinancing: Transatlantic crossing to cement relationship MR TONY RYAN may have ceded control of the company he founded in 1975 but it was his future boss, Mr Gary Wendt, chief executive of GE Capital, who was yesterday forced to travel the Atlantic for their first one-to-one meeting since their tentative deal was agreed. While two of GPA's directors, Mr Patrick Blaney and Mr John Tierney, were addressing bondholders in New York, Mr Ryan was busy cementing his relationship with Mr Wendt at GPA's Shannon headquarters, in the Irish Republic. The two men got to know each other when Mr Wendt joined GPA's board as a non-executive director after General Electric's financial services arm bought a 22.7 per cent stake in 1983. Mr Wendt subsequently left the board when GE Capital sold its stake in the middle eighties. Over the past two months he has been in constant touch with Mr Ryan in New York. But yesterday Mr Wendt paid him the compliment of visiting him at his headquarters to reassure the bulk of the staff that they will still have jobs if GPA becomes a separate subsidiary of GE Capital. He has told Mr Ryan he wants him to stay on as chairman for at least another two years. However, Mr Wendt, as one of the group's lenders explained, 'is no pushover'. A number of key posts at GPA are likely to be filled by GE Capital, which owns Polaris Aircraft leasing, one of GPA's big competitors with more than 400 aircraft on lease. Under the terms of the deal, tentatively agreed on Tuesday night and finalised by fax between New York, London and Dublin on Wednesday, GE Capital will purchase aircraft, worth Dollars 1.35bn (Pounds 870m), and co-sponsor ALPS2 (securitization of aircraft leases) which could raise up to Dollars 700m. It is still to agree, however, on what price it should pay for its option to take 60 per cent of GPA's equity, rising to 80 per cent under certain conditions by March 1997. No one in the negotiations, which could continue for several months, expects GE Capital to inject more than Dollars 400m, and some believe the US company will try to get away with paying considerably less. But as one of GPA's directors said: 'GE is no christmas tree. You do not expect the world when you sign a deal at five minutes to midnight'. While Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette were busy preparing the terms of a moratorium on payments to bondholders with proposals for a debt-for-equity swap, GPA had been warned by its lead bankers of the dire consequences of failing to sign a deal with GE Capital. At a briefing session of its main lenders on Tuesday, GPA was told that a moratorium on bond payments would inevitably lead to examination, the Irish equivalent to administration. The group still has to overcome some formidable hurdles before the deal can be finalised. It needs to raise Dollars 100m from its core bankers, in the form of a bridging loan, and a further Dollars 100m to Dollars 150m from a few of its investors led by its biggest shareholder, the Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corporation. The new finance is required to honour the bond payments over the next two months, the first Dollars 50m of which falls on May 17. Mitsubishi, which owns 12 per cent of the shares, is expected to invest at least Dollars 20m and the Irish government, through Shannon Development, is willing to invest up to Dollars 20m (Pounds 13m). While other shareholders have given indications of firm interest the banks will have to convert the indications into hard cash over the next few days.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Mogadishu, 5 Apr (AFP) -- Heavy guns pounded  several parts of south Mogadishu late Monday [4 April] as rival  Somali clans clashed in the most fierce battle in several  months, witnesses said. A Somali journalist said at least one  person was killed in the fighting which lasted almost three  hours.    The fighting occurred between the K4 roundabout on Afgooye  Road and the seaport. Militiamen exchanged machinegun and  rocket fire. It was unclear which clans were involved in the  fighting, but Somali journalists said it pitted "bandits from  rival clans".    South Mogadishu is the fiefdom of warlord Mohamed Farah  Aidid  of the Somali National Alliance (SNA). United Nations deputy  military spokesman Major Asif Iqbal said no United Nations  peacekeeping forces were involved in the fighting. "We don't  know which clans were involved in this", Major Iqbal said.  [passage omitted]    Factional fighting has been escalating during the week, but  previous clashes involved the use of small arms. Three SNA  officials were reportedly killed near the October 21 Road on  Sunday by a lone gunman who fired into a crowd, a Somali  journalist said. SNA militiamen vowed to retaliate and  surrounded a building near the stadium.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["News Bulletin" No. 82/94] </F>   [Text] Estonian-Russian negotiations would escape from the  present deadlock if Estonia approved an order of deportation of  unwanted aliens, head of the National Independence Party Tartu  section Andres Mae said. Russia would take Estonia more  seriously if it demonstrated its willingness to maintain order,  Mae said. But he admitted that the move would result in a major  Russian propaganda offensive.</p>

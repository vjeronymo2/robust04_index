			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Fleming joins the rush ONLY 64 investing days remain before April 5, the end of the tax year, and the financial service industry is pulling out all the marketing stops. The latest investment trust on offer is Fleming Income &amp; Capital. Like many recent issues, it has a split capital structure and is linked to the personal equity plan (Pep) market. The offer is timed so that investors can place their full Pounds 6,000 Pep allowance into the trust for each of the tax years 1991-92 and 1992-93. A married couple could thus put Pounds 24,000, in Pep form, into this issue. There are two classes of share: zero coupon and ordinary income. The former are being issued at 30p and should be repaid at 85.2p in 2002, a yield of 11 per cent a year. Security is provided by the fact that the initial assets of the trust will cover 112 per cent of the zero's ultimate repayment value. Private investors cannot apply directly for the zeroes, though. They can be bought either in the after-market (when the price might have risen and the yield fallen) or packaged in a 100p unit with the ordinary income shares. The ordinary income shares will receive all the income of the trust and will, at 70p each, offer a dividend yield of 9 per cent. For a top-rate taxpayer holding the shares in a Pep, the equivalent gross yield is 15 per cent. The risk, as with other shares in this category, is of loss of capital. The ordinary income shares will be repaid only after the zeroes. The trust's assets will need to grow at 5.2 per cent a year for the shares to be repaid at the issue price. This growth rate is not as fast as that needed by some other ordinary shares, but potential investors should remember that it might not happen. An alternative would be to buy the unit at 100p, which would yield 6.3 per cent. In such a case, an investor could almost ignore the split structure (although, on past experience, it should prevent the shares from falling to a discount). Fleming Income &amp; Capital could then be judged simply as a high-yield UK equity investment trust. Because Fleming is paying 3 per cent to IFAs, the charges on the trust are near traditional unit-trust levels. Money can be saved by buying the shares through a discount service. Another option is provided by Halifax Standard's new Income Advantage unit trust although, owing to the government's rules, only Pounds 3,000 can be placed in this trust in Pep form. The trust will invest internationally and will have a yield of 5.5 per cent. The initial charge is 5.5 per cent and the annual charge is 1.5.</p>

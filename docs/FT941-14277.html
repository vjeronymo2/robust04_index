			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / S African township taxes to be paid South Africa's black township dwellers are to resume paying rent and taxes to local governments, ending a decade-long boycott which played a part in forcing the ruling National party to end apartheid. Representatives of black community organisations yesterday signed an accord calling on residents to restart payments, in exchange for a government commitment to resume and improve the quality of services in black townships, where electricity, water, sewage and refuse collection are provided intermittently or not at all. African National Congress President Nelson Mandela told a conference of local authorities yesterday the ANC would launch a campaign to end the boycott, which could prove an embarrassment to a new ANC government. Residents who have paid no charges for years will not resume immediately, despite Mr Mandela's urging; many will resist paying until services improve substantially. The agreement is part of a radical reorganisation of local government to end racial segregation. Within 90 days, most black and white local councils will merge, and share one tax base, ahead of local government elections later this year or next.</p>

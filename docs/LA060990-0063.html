			<p><P> June 9, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH MAKES USE OF UNIQUE ASSET -- HIS FIRST LADY  </P> <P> In a way his recent predecessors never did, President Bush is making use of a  unique political asset -- the First Lady.  </P> <P> He mentioned Barbara Bush -- to enthusiastic applause -- at every stop on his  four-state fund-raising trip for Republican candidates this week.  </P> <P> In fact, the GOP faithful in the Midwest seemed more responsive to the mention  of Mrs. Bush's activities than they were to the President's account of the  Soviet-American summit meeting.  </P> <P> Friday was Mrs. Bush's 65th birthday, giving Bush an added reason to bring up  her name.  </P> <P> "I wish that Barbara were here on her birthday -- the hero of Wellesley. I'm  very, very proud of her," he said in remarks at a luncheon here. He was  referring to her commencement address last week at Wellesley College, where she  had been the subject of complaints that she had been invited as speaker only  because of her husband's achievements.  </P> <P> By contrast, former President Ronald Reagan's advisers sometimes felt that his  wife, Nancy, was a liability, especially in the early years of his presidency.  Certainly, Reagan did not keep political audiences informed of Mrs. Reagan's  doings.  </P> <P> Rosalynn Carter, Betty Ford and Lady Bird Johnson were all active but more  controversial first ladies. Pat Nixon and Mamie Eisenhower almost always stayed  in the political background.  </P> <P> In his speeches on behalf of GOP candidates this week, Bush took pains to  mention that Mrs. Bush also gave her endorsement to GOP incumbents and  challengers alike.  </P> <P> Even some of the GOP candidates Bush endorsed saluted his wife almost as a  co-President, and one even quoted from her Wellesley speech.  </P> <P> While opinion polls indicate that the President is enjoying unprecedented  popularity, Mrs. Bush seems to have a universal appeal that goes beyond  politics.  </P> <P> Her husband affectionately refers to her as "the silver fox" or by a family  nickname, "Bar," in his otherwise straight-forward political talks.  </P> <P> In Des Moines on Friday morning, the President said he had spoken with his  wife.  </P> <P> "She seems unexcited about her 65th birthday," he said. "She's doing just  great. And thank you for giving Barbara and me the opportunity to serve the  greatest country on the face of the Earth," he concluded.  </P> <P> In Chicago on Thursday night, Bush apologized for being tardy, saying he had  been on the phone with his "birthday girl."  </P> <P> He disclosed that British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher preferred to talk  about Mrs. Bush's Wellesley speech rather than about the outcome of his summit  talks with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.  </P> <P> While her husband was touring the Midwest, the First Lady devoted part of her  birthday to a favorite task, reading to children.  </P> <P> Mrs. Bush appeared on ABC-TV's "Good Morning America" and read to a dozen  children seated around her. The story was "Leo, the Late Bloomer," about a lion  who was slow to learn to read and write.  </P> <P> The children responded with a chorus of "Happy Birthday, Mrs. Bush."  </P> <P> "Oh, how'd you know?" she asked. "Who told you that secret? Thank you very,  very much."  </P> <P> Later in the day, Mrs. Bush visited a class at Berkshire Elementary School in  District Heights, Md., for another reading session.  </P></p>

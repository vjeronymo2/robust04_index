			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / International Company News: Mercedes-Benz car output set to fall 5% PRODUCTION of Mercedes- Benz cars is expected to fall by around 5 per cent this year to 505,000, the lowest since 1984. Car output fell to just under 530,000 last year from 578,000 in 1990 and a peak of 598,000 in 1987. Mr Helmut Werner, chief executive-elect of Mercedes-Benz, the automotive subsidiary of Daimler-Benz, Germany's biggest industrial corporation, forecast a small rise in car sales, however, to 540,000 this year from 530,000 in 1992, helped by the launch of a replacement for its ageing 190 saloon range in the summer. Car output for the whole of 1993 will be depressed by the urgent need to reduce excess stocks. Mr Gerhard Liener, Daimler-Benz finance director, said late last year that Mercedes-Benz had excess stocks of around 35,000 cars worldwide. To cut stocks the German luxury car maker has eliminated 25 production days at its plants since mid-December through extended holidays and short-time working. Production of commercial vehicles fell to 277,000 last year from a peak of 296,000 in 1991 and Mr Werner forecast a further fall this year to 260,000. He said that 1993 would be 'an especially difficult year' financially despite forecasting a modest rise in turnover to DM68bn (Dollars 43bn) from DM66bn in 1992. Mr Werner warned that total west European new car sales this year would fall by around 7 per cent, due mostly to a drop of up to 15 per cent in sales in Germany, the single biggest market in Europe. Registrations of new commercial vehicles in Germany could fall this year by up to 17 per cent, he said. Correction: Mercedes-Benz is to produce a 'people carrier' later in the 1990s and not a 'people's car' as incorrectly stated yesterday.</p>

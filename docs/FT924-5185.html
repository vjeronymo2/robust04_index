			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Survey of FT Traveller, Paris (13): Golden rules - Business etiquette, introductory lunches play a pivotal part in forging corporate liaisons and doing deals. But the social side of business still has a special salience. WHEN Bernard Arnault, one of France's most ambitious businessman, arrived at Christian Dior, the fashion house he bought in the mid-1980s, he was asked out to lunch by one of his new colleagues. 'Why?' replied Mr Arnault. 'What would we have to talk about?' The story may be apocryphal - most stories about Mr Arnault are - but the incredulity with which it is still repeated in Paris business circles serves to highlight the importance of that most sacrosanct of France's corporate rituals, le dejeuner, otherwise known as lunch. In a city where whom you know or, more specifically, who graduated with you from your Haute Ecole, is just as important as what you know, the social side of business still has a special salience. Lunches play a pivotal part in forging corporate liaisons and doing deals. But unfortunately for the foreign visitor to Paris, the written and unwritten rules on what you should and should not say over the lunchtable are not only very strict, but incredibly complicated. The golden rule to remember is that no-one ever, ever actually dirties their hands by doing business during lunch. Broadly speaking there are three types of business lunches. The first, which appears wantonly time-wasting to Anglo-Saxon eyes, is the 'introductory' meal at which you make contact with someone with whom you might want to do business in the future, but at which you would not dream of discussing anything concrete. The second lunch is more constructive. This is the type of meal at which a new venture may be discussed although, yet again, no-one in Paris would ever expect to actually clinch a deal over the lunchtable. If the time has come to sign on the dotted line, you will have to wait until you go back to the office after the meal. You can then move on to the third and final form of dejeuner, celebrating a deal that has already been done. The only time you are expected to talk about business is during dessert. In the meantime you are allowed to discourse on everything from world affairs, to the state of the European economy and the latest amours of the Monegasque royal family (whom the French generally find more interesting than the British equivalent) - anything in fact but the reason for the lunch. Finally, you have to brace yourself for a lengthy lunch in Paris - two hours is the absolute minimum, three is generally seen as more polite - and also for an assault on the arteries. Four courses - hors d'oeuvre, plat du jour, cheese and dessert with coffee - are the norm, although it is just permissible to skip the cheese and get straight down to business. As for the delicate question of language. The French business elite is in a cosmopolitan mode at the moment. Most senior executives speak at least one other language, usually English, reasonably fluently, and possibly two or three others. However ropey your French it is always considered courteous to at least try to speak it to your new contacts, even if you do breathe a deep sigh of relief when they break into your own tongue. The English are at a distinct advantage in that the French language apparently sounds particularly charming when spoken with an English accent, just as English does when spoken by the French. The poor Spaniards lose out, as French is said to sound particularly harsh when spoken with Spanish tones. But wherever you come from, you must never forget that it is very rude to call your new French contact tu, unless they invite you to do so first. In the meantime, you should always use the formal vous.</p>

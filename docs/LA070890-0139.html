			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AUTUMN OF A DICTATOR  </P> <P> I visited Chile two weeks after Dorfman. I saw a business district swarming  with hard-working people bustling among small shops. Everything seemed in ample  supply and demand.  </P> <P> I visited the poorer areas of the town and saw clean streets, a proud people  and decent houses surrounding tiny shops.  </P> <P> And yes, at 2 a.m. I saw the carabineros roughing up a young man while taking  him to their armored car. As my Chilean hostess screamed "Asesino!" at the  Uzi-toting police, my personal belief in freedom quickly wrestled with my need  to survive.  </P> <P> The Chile I saw is strong enough to wrestle with the past, but the Chilean  people I met have an irrepressible drive to succeed in the future through their  own hard work.  </P> <P> WAYNE SOCHA  </P> <P> Monrovia  </P></p>

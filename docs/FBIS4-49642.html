			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Sun Chengbin (1327 2110 2430)] </F>   [Text] Hong Kong, 8 May (XINHUA) -- On 8 May, mainland  members of the political and economic groups of the Preliminary  Working Committee for the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong  Special Administrative Region took part in a discussion meeting  with people from various social organizations at the grassroots  level in Hong Kong to extensively hear their opinions and  suggestions on matters related to Hong Kong's transition, the  work of the Preliminary Working Committee, and issues concerning  the living conditions in Hong Kong, which are things of great  interest to Hong Kong residents.    Zheng Guoxiong, XINHUA Hong Kong Branch deputy director,  presided over the discussion meeting. Groups taking part in the  discussion meeting included the Hong Kong Educational Workers'  Association, the New Territory Social Groups Association, the  Housing Occupants Association, the Hong Kong Friends of Study  Society, and the Hong Kong Association of Chinese for Reform.    At the discussion meeting, participants fully expressed  their  opinions. Members of the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions  and the Hong Kong Housing Occupants Association expressed their  opinions and put forward a lot of constructive suggestions on  social securities for retired workers and the "three highs"  situation, namely "high land prices, high apartment prices, and  high rent." The Hong Kong Educational Workers' Association  suggested holding a joint meeting with the participation of Hong  Kong's educational workers to strengthen contacts and relations  with the cultural group of the Preliminary Working Committee and  reflect the views and wishes of the educational circles on Hong  Kong affairs during the transitional period. They also  suggested further popularizing Hong Kong Basic Law at middle and  primary schools in Hong Kong and strengthening relations between  educational circles in Hong Kong and Mainland China. The New  Territory Social Groups Association put forward suggestions on  speeding up the harnessing of the Shenzhen River, making an  overall plan for transportation between Hong Kong and Guangdong,  and simplifying customs inspection procedures and ensuring the  smooth passage of people and vehicles through Shenzhen. The Hong  Kong Friends of Study Society also put forward some suggestions  on youth work in Hong Kong.    Lu Ping, vice chairman and concurrently secretary general of  the Preliminary Working Committee seriously heard their remarks  and said: The masses at the grassroots level in Hong Kong are  the rudiments of Hong Kong's foundation and are Hong Kong's  roots. The so-called "governing Hong Kong by people in Hong  Kong" [gang ren zhi gang 3263 0086 3112 3263] must not be  narrowly interpreted as governing Hong Kong by the small number  of people from government departments. The connotation of  "governing Hong Kong by people in Hong Kong" is quite extensive.  First, we should let the broad masses of residents at the  grassroots level govern Hong Kong. We will realize Hong Kong's  stability and prosperity in the future through "governing Hong  Kong by people in Hong Kong." Lu Ping said: He hope that you  will give full play to the power of Hong Kong residents and  everyone should join efforts to realize "governing Hong Kong by  people in Hong Kong."    Lu Ping said: I earlier said that Hong Kong is an economic  city and we hope that it will not be changed into a political  city. I said this with Hong Kong's special characteristics in  mind [wo zhe mo jiang shi you zhen dui xing di 2053 6638 8010  6199 2508 2589 6859 1417 1840 4104]. He hoped that everyone  would show solicitude to the transitional work in Hong Kong and  care for political affairs and the future of Hong Kong.    Lu Ping reiterated that the Chinese side is willing to  cooperate with the British side in other fields. He said:  However, cooperation is a two-way thing. The key to whether  the cooperation can be successful or not lies in whether the  British side has sincerity or not. We have not seen any such  signs at present.    Zhang Junsheng, XINHUA Hong Kong Branch deputy director,  also  attended today's discussion meeting.</p>

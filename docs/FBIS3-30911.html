Tudor"]    [Text] Romania's minister of national defense, General  Niculae Spiroiu, declared in a television broadcast of the "Pro  Patria" program that he wishes to end the conflict with Senator  C.V. Tudor. "Let us consider it a closed chapter, we have much  to do in the Army," said Mr. Spiroiu, although at the news  conference of the Greater Romania Party on 3 February the leader  of that party continued his accusations and slander against the  dignitary, who is a member of the Vacaroiu government. He  called the defense minister: "A minister who is a trafficker and  a maniac," "a political adventurer," "the epitome of  incompetence," and a person who "demolished the arms industry,"  "turned the ministry into a small feudal family," and  "permanently misinformed the state institutions." Here are a  few examples of the way Senator V.C. Tudor portrayed Minister  Spiroiu at the recent news conference of the Greater Romania  Party. Therefore, the general's decision to call for an end to  the conflict is viewed as a more than surprising act, since Mr.  Spiroiu has not even turned to the legal authorities to have  Senator C.V. Tudor reprimanded for his remarks.</p>

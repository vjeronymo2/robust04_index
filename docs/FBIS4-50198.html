			<p>BFN     [Text] Wuhan, May 15 (XINHUA) -- Central China's Hubei  Province has found that economic co-operation is an effective  way to achieve prosperity. According to local officials, over  the past few years various items of economic co-operations have  generated an additional output value of 23.4 billion yuan for  the province, which has netted an extra 3.1 billion yuan of  profits and taxes from such efforts.    The province now has more than 300 economic co-operation  organizations or agencies of various kinds which are scattered  across the country and have launched over 60,000 projects of  economic co-operation, involving a total investment of 17.38  billion yuan.    Economic co-operation organizations have changed the past  practice of goods exchange into the establishment of regional or  trans-regional markets and specialized networks, all resulting  in the enlivening of commodity collection and distribution.    Take the grand economic co-operation zone involving 38  counties and cities in Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan and Guizhou  Provinces as an example. Last year, this zone carried out  co-operation projects, and lent and borrowed money worth more  than 300 million yuan, while forming conglomerates to produce  and market industrial products, tea and tung oil, which sell  well in many foreign countries.    At the same time, different localities in the province have  taken the initiative and set out to collect market information,  promote the marketing of products and launch investment  promotion events.    Last year Hubei established more than 50 economic  co-operation agencies in coastal and economically-developed  areas. These agencies have promoted the establishment of 40  foreign-funded enterprises in the province.</p>

The white men kept protesters away from the  looted Megacity shopping complex and the University of  Bophuthatswana in Mmabatho on Thursday [10 March] night.    It was not known who the white men were. The South African  Defence Force earlier on Thursday night denied that its had sent  soldiers to the homeland.    Gunshots were heard in the vicinity of the university, where  there was a group of about 100 white men in camouflage.    Meanwhile, members of the rightwing Afrikaner  Weerstandsbeweging [AWB, Afrikaner Resistance Movement] have  arrived in Mmabatho and are believed to be converging at the  city's prison.    An SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] television  crew was stopped by a large group of AWB members. The keys for  their vehicle were taken and thrown away, their film confiscated  and destroyed and the crew left stranded on the road between  Mmabatho and Zeerust.    Acccording to SABC-TV producer Nan Roux the team had been  harassed and she was mobilising people from the Mmbatho Sun  Hotel to rescue the stranded crew.    ITN [Independent Television News] reporter James Brittan  said  he had seen a group of about 30 white farmers in bakkies about  10km outside Mmabatho. "They were all driving farm vehicles and  we asssume they were AWB members. They then turned off the main  road and we followed them for a short way before returning to  Mmabatho," he said.    SA Police said on Thursday night they are aware that of a  group of at least 200 rightwingers had moved from Zeerust to a  place close to Bophuthatswana.    Western Transvaal police spokesman Capt Koos Degenaar told  SAPA police were aware of the rightwing movements.    The SAP [South African Police] was not able to ascertain  exactly where the group was gathering and therefore could not  act.    He said police in the Western Transvaal had "sharpened our  patrols along the Bophuthatswana borders because of all the  unrest" in the homeland.    He said the SAP could not act outside of South Africa but  were making an extra effort to patrol the borders.</p>

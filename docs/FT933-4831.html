			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Observer: City Soccer It's not yet the stuff of schoolboy fiction. Francis Lee, former England football star, denies wanting to buy up Manchester City, his old club, despite tabloid rumours to the contrary. Lee was gruff yesterday about gossip suggesting he was making an Pounds 8m hostile bid, though he did say his substantial investment might be available, if shareholders and supporters were interested. Lee scored on his debut, in 1960 aged 16, for Bolton Wanderers. Two years later he transferred to City. But despite his soccer talents, he quickly spotted he might need another way of making a living. After asking for a pay rise, the Bolton manager of the day told him he was merely a labourer. Lee thus started trading in waste paper, quickly realising the big money was in recycling it as toilet tissue. In 1984, he sold out to Hazlewood for Pounds 8m. On the Hazlewood main board, he now finds his greatest professional joy in training horses at his highly successful racing stable in Cheshire.</p>

			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / China sees growth continuing at 8% CHINA expects to sustain economic growth of about 8 per cent annually to the end of this century. This would bring the Chinese economy within range of becoming the world's biggest within two decades. Mr Gan Ziyu, vice minister of the state planning commission, said yesterday that China's goal of quadrupling 1980 gross national product by the year 2000 - a target that was decried by many economists when it was unveiled - would be realised earlier. China's extraordinary economic surge has forced a review of growth targets in its current five-year plan (1991-95), which had envisaged growth of some 6 per cent annually. Mr Gan, in a briefing with reporters, dismissed suggestions that the economy was overheating, saying it would continue to grow in a quick-paced but sustainable manner. The Chinese official said the government would 'fine tune' the economy to achieve sustainable rates of growth. This would be done by restricting credit and restraining growth in the money supply. China registered real GNP growth last year of more than 12 per cent, exceeding both the planned 6 per cent for 1992 and the 9 per cent average of the past 13 years. Economic activity shows little sign of slackening this year. China's economic boom - growth may have been much higher in 1992 than officially acknowledged - has prompted a sharp debate within the Chinese leadership about the dangers of renewed inflation caused by excessive demand. Bank lending increased last year by double the planned figure, money in circulation doubled, and the broader measure of money supply (M2) charged ahead by 28 per cent. Inflation in the large urban centres reached 14 per cent compared with a national average of about 6 per cent. Mr Gan, meanwhile, added that China planned to import an average of Dollars 70bn-Dollars 80bn annually of technology, machinery and raw materials in the present five-year plan.</p>

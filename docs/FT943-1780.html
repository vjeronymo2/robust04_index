			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / International Company News: Cash &amp; carry sale blamed for Fitzwilton depression Fitzwilton, the Irish industrial holding group with significant food retailing interests, reported a reduction in pre-tax profits from IPounds 1.02m to IPounds 259,000 (Pounds 255,730) in the six months to June 30. However, profits from continuing operations surged from IPounds 941,000 to IPounds 3.23m. The shares closed 1p up at 44p. Mr Tony O'Reilly, chairman and owner of a 15.23 per cent stake, said the period had been influenced by four developments. Of these, the sale of the M6 Cash &amp; Carry division to Nurdin &amp; Peacock lay behind the depressed pre-tax profits. Mr Patrick Dowling, finance director, said the Pounds 21.9m sale, plus the assumption by N&amp;P of Pounds 10.5m debt was 'a heck of a good price.' In another development Fitzwilton raised its stake in FA Wellworth from 43 to 97 per cent, concentrating group activities within Northern Ireland's food retailing sector. Some IPounds 50m of new equity raised in the period marked the third development and helped finance the IPounds 41m purchase of the extra 54 per cent of Wellworth. The retailer was bought with venture capital partners from Isosceles for IPounds 120m, which Mr Dowling said looked very favourable 'in the light of what Tesco paid for Wm Low.' Wellworth is set to contribute 70 per cent of group profits this year. In the 53 weeks to April 30, the 36-store retailer raised operating profits to Pounds 18.5m, against Pounds 16.3m in the previous 52 weeks. The fourth influence in the period was the turnround at Waterford Wedgwood. Fitzwilton's 9.4 per cent holding, worth some IPounds 40m, represents 40 per cent of its capitalisation. Total losses per share were 0.52p (0.31p), but, on continuing activities, earnings were 0.84p (losses 0.18p). The interim dividend is reduced to 1p (1.5p).</p>

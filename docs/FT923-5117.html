			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / The French Referendum: Seguin, French crusader goes into battle against Mitterrand tonight - Profile of the bulky Gauloise-smoking opponent of Maastricht MR PHILIPPE Seguin, the thinking Frenchman's crusader against the Maastricht treaty on European Union, tonight does battle against a cornered President Francois Mitterrand. The bulky, Gauloise-smoking conservative has been chosen by Mr Mitterrand for a televised verbal duel on the pros and cons of Maastricht. The stakes are very high. The president is under pressure from some quarters to resign, in order to let voters decide in the September 20 treaty referendum unencumbered by their feelings over his battered personal image. Mr Mitterrand, alarmed by the recent surprise swing of public opinion against the treaty, chose to face Mr Seguin because he wanted to settle the score with possibly the most active and articulate campaigner against the treaty. If Mr Seguin pushes hard and cleverly enough, he could force Mr Mitterrand to clarify his intentions as well as increase the 'No' vote. At the very least, the quality of their performance could give a much needed steer to the French public's complex and volatile feelings about Mr Mitterrand and Europe. This is the first time Mr Mitterrand has faced down an opposition politician live on television for more than four years. That was in the 1988 pre-presidential election debate with Mr Jacques Chirac, leader of the RPR Gaullist party, of which Mr Seguin is a rebellious member. The choice of Mr Seguin surprised some people, for he is not a mainstream opposition leader; a mere junior minister in the previous conservative government and maverick upholder of old style Gaullism. However, the two mainstream opposition leaders are campaigning in favour of Maastricht. Mr Seguin is also one of the very few anti-Maastricht campaigners to abstain from dragging Mr Mitterrand's battered image and the socialists' record into the European union campaign. The wily Mr Mitterrand might have calculated that paying this compliment to Mr Seguin might further split the Gaullists. He and Mr Charles Pasqua lead the two thirds of the RPR who say 'No' to Maastricht and tried three years ago to oust the moderately pro-treaty Mr Chirac. They might easily try again and some commentators talk of Mr Seguin as a future RPR leader. Mr Seguin, 49, an expert on Napoleonic history, is a defender of French sovereignty to the bottom of his soul. Born and educated in Tunisia before independence, his deep patriotism is a feature of the so-called 'pieds noirs.' He is not against the European Community, but argues that the treaty is dangerously ambiguous and makes possible an uncontrollable transfer of sovereignty from national governments to Brussels. A single European currency would signal the end of independent national economic policies, without providing a better curb on exchange rate instability than the European Monetary System as it is now, he argues. An independent European central bank would be dangerously unaccountable. France should hold out for a renegotiation. Mr Seguin's vision of Europe is exactly in line with General de Gaulle's idea of a flexible community of independent states. 'Yes, we want Europe, but upright,' Mr Seguin told parliament in June, echoing a de Gaulle pronouncement on France's entry into the EC. The anglophile Mr Seguin's policies would go down well among many UK conservatives. Indeed, he once likened himself to the Tory wets. Mr Seguin has no time for socialist ministers' warnings of economic armageddon in the event of a 'No' vote. He recalls the time the French parliament rejected plans for a European defence community in 1954, despite jittery post-war predictions of armageddon. In the event, Europe grew up peacefully without a defence community, just as it will without Maastricht, he says.</p>

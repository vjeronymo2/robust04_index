			<p><P> February 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAIDER REBUILDING STARTS WITH INCREASE IN TICKET PRICES  </P> <P> The Raiders have begun their rebuilding process in a strange spot -- their own  coffers.  </P> <P> Coming off a 7-9 season, their third straight year without a playoff berth and  their lowest average attendance in five seasons, the club has raised ticket  prices.  </P> <P> It's a small raise, to be sure.  </P> <P> The highest-priced tickets will go from $28 to $30 a seat. That affects 27,000  seats along the Coliseum sidelines. The rest of the tickets, priced at $20 and  $13, remain the same.  </P> <P> There was no official announcement of the change and no Raider official wished  to be quoted.  </P> <P> Instead, the news was sent in a letter to season-ticket holders that read, in  part: "Despite constantly escalating costs in every aspect of operation, the  Raiders have made just a slight increase in some ticket prices for the first  time in three years."  </P> <P> In all, the Raiders have about 40,000 season-ticket holders in the 92,000-seat  plus Coliseum. Their average attendance last year was 52,6255.  </P> <P> A Ram spokesman said that club plans no increase for 1989. Ram tickets run $25,  $19 and $13.  </P> <P> Three teams in the Raiders' division -- Seattle, Denver and Kansas City -- are  raising some tickets an average of $5. STEVE SPRINGER  </P></p>

			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / People: Mosaic adds another piece Andrew Davison, a former managing director of County NatWest Ventures, is to take over the helm of Mosaic Investments, a troubled mini-conglomerate best known for handling the marketing rights to cartoon characters such as Roland Rat, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Tom and Jerry and Thunderbirds. Davison, 50, will take over from Hugh Sykes, 60, the company doctor who was brought in last October shortly after Mosaic's shares had been suspended because it could not raise sufficient funds to redeem a preference share issue. Mosaic had been an acquisitive glamour stock for a brief period during the 1980s, and its reputation was boosted by the fact that Tomkins chief executive Greg Hutchings was a big shareholder. However, when the company ran into serious financial problems Hutchings, who took on the chairmanship briefly, turned to Sykes to sort out the company. Several poorly performing and loss-making businesses have been sold and the company has been refinanced. A Pounds 2m preference share issue will eliminate borrowings and leave it with net assets of Pounds 8.7m. The shares, which touched Pounds 5.15 at one stage, were suspended at 60p. They resumed trading seven months later at 19p and had recovered to 24p yesterday. Having completed his company doctoring role, Sykes says that it is time to hand over to someone to take the company forward. Leon Angrave, Mosaic's managing director, resigned last week and it is expected that Davison's role will be a semi-executive one which will occupy a substantial proportion of his time. Davison, who was found through headhunters, is a non-executive director of Pepe group, the international jeanswear group, and Holliday Chemical Holdings. After building County NatWest Ventures into one the biggest development capital companies in the UK, Davison spent four years heading Business Mortgages Trust, a listed bank, which he reorganised and sold to Nykredit, a Danish mortgage company, following a hostile bid from National Home Loans in 1989.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From BTA press review] </F>   [Text] Sofia, April 29 (BTA) -- Yesterday's resignation of  Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Trade Valentin Karabashev  is in the highlights of today's press. Most dailies carry  frontpage reports commenting on Mr. Karabashev's motives. The  fate of Deputy Prime Minister Karabashev was decided by his  Alternative Social Liberal Party (ASP) as early as last week,  reads an editorial in DEMOKRATSIYA, the daily of the Union of  Democratic Forces (SDS). It goes on to say that Mr.  Karabashev's resignation had to do with the privatization by  businessmen close to the ASP of two hotels in the Sunny Beach  resort on the Black Sea. Minister of Industry Rumen Bikov, the  other ASP representative in the cabinet, will stay on for the  time being. However, the private STANDART NEWS writes that Mr.  Bikov was likely to resign, too. He had told the daily's report  that he considered doing so.    24 CHASA carries an interview with Mr. Karabashev. "At first  I was offered to stay as a deputy prime minister or a minister  without portfolio, but in the course of the conversation I had  with Mr. Berov it did not become clear to me what my  responsibilities were supposed to be. Using other sources, I  found out that he himself was unclear about it," he said. In  his opinion, what the prime minister intends to do would be  disastrous to the government.    OTECHESTVEN VESTNIK writes that "after Valentin Karabashev's  resignation (backed by the parliamentary New Union for  Democracy, which withdrew its support from Lyuben Berov's  cabinet) the Movement for Rights and Freedoms (DPS) will now  find itself in the spotlight and will hardly muster the courage  to accept the conditions of the Bulgarian Socialist Party  (BSP).... Facing the threat of ultimate discredit if they do  so, it would be no surprise if the DPS decide to follow suit and  withdraw their support from the cabinet, thus prompting  procedures for the formation of a new cabinet.    KONTINENT comments on the same issue under the headline  "Struggle for Ministerial Posts." "The resignation of Mr.  Karabashev as deputy prime minister paves the way for the formal  procedures for the expected structural and personal changes  which the government and parliament have been using for months  to fool the crisis-crushed electorate." "The cabinet overhaul  has nothing to do with the work the ministers have or have not  done for the nation; it has to do with the work they have or  have not done to satisfy certain private interests," the daily  comments.    Newspapers hurry to prognosticate on the future members of  the cabinet. STANDART NEWS mentions the names of Emil Khursev,  ex-vice governor of the central bank, Aleksandur Tomov, leader  of the Civil Alliance for the Republic (GOR, a centrist  formation which split off from the BSP), and Chavdar Kunchev,  head of the Bulgarian Foreign Trade Bank, as possible candidates  for the post of deputy prime minister on the foreign debt.  According to DEMOKRATSIYA and STANDART NEWS, the next minister  of trade would be Bulgaria's Ambassador to Japan Konstantin  Glavanakov, a friend of ex-Prime Minister and MP of the BSP  Andrey Lukanov.</p>

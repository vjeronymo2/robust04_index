			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Review of Latvian Press"] </F>   [Text] Riga, March 18 (LETA) -- Latvian press of today is  publishing an extensive coverage of the texts of Latvian-Russian  agreements initialed in Moscow earlier this week. The daily  DIENA cites the opinion expressed on the matter by Aleksandrs  Kirsteins, head of the parliamentarian Foreign Committee, who  claims that there were numerous discrepancies between the  documents which have been initialled by the two delegations, and  the draft agreements which earlier have been presented for a  closer examination of members of parliament. The rights to be  granted to the retired Russian militaries under the agreements  Kirsteins described as "anticonstitutional". He indicated that  initialing of the package of the agreements was partly a result  of pressure inflicted on Russia by the United States and the  Conference on Security and Cooperation (CSCE), while the  government of the ruling parliamentarian faction "Latvijas Cels"  ("Latvian Way") "automatically puts its signature under all the  demands put forward by Russia". The leader of the nationalist  "Latvia's National Independence Movement" faction holds the view  that those at least 70 thousand officers of the KGB secret  police and commissioned officers of Russian Army which have come  to Latvia en masse, notably in the past recent years after  combat actions in so called "hot spots", are much more dangerous  for Latvia than those several thousand Russian troops.  Kirsteins underscores that the two parties have not reached any  agreement which would provide for the future development of  relations between Russia and Latvia for the next 20 years. The  Latvian negotiators did not even raise the issue about Russia's  recognizing occupation of Latvia, which had already been done in  1991 by the then Supreme Council of the former Soviet Union.  Kirsteins pointed out that the lack of agreements to this effect  showed there were no basis laid out for guarantees providing a  compensation to be paid for Latvia's property and for the Abrene  region annexed by Russia. Meanwhile, Latvian Justice Minister  Egils Levits said that the accord with Russia was "an important  achievement of Latvian diplomats". The minister said he was  certain that historians would evaluate the agreement as a  successful move, citing the course of events with the pact of  Latvia and Russia signed in 1920.    The package of initialled agreements between Russia and  Latvia were needed by Latvian President in order to receive an  entrance ticket to the St. George hall of the Kremlin, indicates  an analyst with the Russian-language newspaper SM-SEGODNYA. The  daily says that it was a high time for Latvian President to  visit his Russian counterpart, otherwise his image of the  popular figure and reconcilator can somewhat fade out, despite  the urgent need for the liberals of the "Latvian Way" party to  demonstrate clearly to the West, notably to the American  friends, their good will towards normalization of relations with  Russia.    The evening daily RIGAS BALSS has published a public opinion  poll conducted among 1,000 residents of Latvia. The  participants of the poll had to chose optional answers to the  question whether performance of Saeima or parliament and that of  the ministers cabinet of Latvia were in accordance with  interests of the Latvian people. The option "fully corresponds"  was chosen by 1.3 percent of people in relation to the  parliament, and by 1.2 percent - in regard to the ministers  cabinet. 15.2 percent of people said that activities of both  parliament and government were "generally corresponding" to the  interests of the Latvian people.</p>

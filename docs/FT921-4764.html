			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: BT BT's decision to accelerate job losses suggests it wants to hedge its bets before the election. It looks as if it will increase its original target of 17,000 staff cuts this year by perhaps 50 per cent. In recent years, the group has shed thousands of staff through natural wastage. The recession has changed all that, not least because Mercury is no longer an avid hirer. Cuts will now cost BT hard cash. At the end of last year, it still had Pounds 173m left from its 1990 provision of roughly Pounds 300m to cover job losses, but that might be enough to make a mere 10,000 staff redundant. BT will need further provisions. That is where political calculation comes in. By taking the costs of job losses earlier than planned, BT can reduce its embarrassingly high profits by perhaps Pounds 200m. That might help keep a Labour government's attention on the other privatised industries. Granted, BT's profits will be higher again in future years, so it risks toughening its regulator's stance in this year's review of post-1993 prices. It will also be adding to the government's unemployment burden. But the strategy has the virtue of keeping BT's options open. Were the Conservatives to win, the job losses could always be trimmed back. There was plenty of other pre-election jockeying among the utilities this week. The water regulator quietly announced a longer-term approach to pricing than hitherto implied by his sniping at the companies, and the government completed the trade sale of Northern Ireland's electricity industry. All that remains to be fixed is how far British Coal will supply the domestic power market. That is the most intractable problem.</p>

			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Sport: The Light Blues' burden - Rowing THE MAIN thing that stops Cambridge winning the varsity boat race is Cambridge. That was the opinion of Mark Lees, last year's Light Blues' coach, after he had watched them lose for the 15th time in 16 years. Lees served three years at Cambridge and spent most of his time trying to break the Oxford voodoo. He produced excellent crews that somehow fell short on the day. He argued that no matter how good the Cambridge crew was, it always strained under the weight of that losing run - a weight that grew heavier during the last two weeks' preparation at Putney when the opposing crews trained in each other's pockets. The last two weeks before the 4 1/4 -mile ordeal are when the mental approach to racing becomes as important as the physical, when the camps try to psyche each other. For example, during a spell of rough weather last week the crews could not get on the water. Cambridge had already lost some rowing time because of injury. 'You can't afford to lose another session,' shouted one of the Oxford contingent in the direction of Cambridge. This was good-natured stuff and greeted with laughter, but the barb was well-aimed. Is Cambridge really the home of lost causes? They have recruited John Wilson, who last year coached the Oxford camp. Wilson knows all the Dark Blues' strengths and weaknesses; he may know Oxford's Achilles' heel as well. Oxford's strength lies in their sophisticated regime of coaching and training. The foundations were laid by Dan Topolski, the coach who turned Oxford around in the 1970s. The system was built up by Steve Royle, Oxford's director of rowing, whose five-year contract expires after today's race. Jurgen Grobler, the former East German national coach, joined as technical consultant this year and said there was little he could add. However, Oxford have appeared vulnerable this time. At the Reading head of the river race on March 7, a timed processional race over 4 1/4 km, Oxford's prospective Blue Boat was beaten into second place by Imperial College. Isis, the reserve Oxford crew, finished just 9 seconds behind the first eight, which left the coaches to ponder crew selection. On February 25, Oxford's squad had been hit by the death in training of John Hebbes, who was fighting for a place in the top boat. As Oxford were losing, Cambridge were spanking Nottingham's international lightweight squad over the first half of the boat race course. They showed plenty of skill and have the beef to go the distance. At Oxford, meantime, the selection knives flashed. Boris Mavra, Hamish Hume and Ian Gardiner were promoted, the latter moving into the stroke seat where he had performed well for Isis. His rise has been meteoric. He learned to row at St Peter's College, Oxford, two years ago. Cambridge argue that the late changes are a sign of panic in the Oxford camp. Cambridge seem in good spirits, and there is little sign of the drooped shoulders that Lees complained of. Observers and bookies have made them favourites, but this is often the kiss of death. The crews race from Putney to Mortlake today, starting at 2.35 pm.</p>

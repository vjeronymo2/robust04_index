			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> About 10 years ago, the Agency reviewed its product approval program to determine if it could be restructured to provide improved safety to miners without increasing the level of resources expended. That review resulted in the promulgation in 1988 of 30 CFR part 7, Applicant or Third-Party Testing, which represented MSHA's first departure from its role of front-end prototype testing of products for approval by substituting manufacturer or third-party testing of a limited number of products for the testing that previously had been conducted by MSHA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The objectives of the program were to permit MSHA to redirect its resources to its post-approval product audit functions, as well as to the review of technological improvements in mining products. The Agency made this shift in emphasis to enhance the safety of products in mines by providing the mining community a greater assurance that approved products in mines continue to be manufactured as approved, by detecting any defective products more effectively, and by enabling a more expeditious introduction of new technology.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Products selected as suitable for applicant or third-party testing under part 7 were those with characteristics which could be objectively tested in a routine and readily reproducible manner, with no elements of subjective analysis. Products whose testing results depend on the experience, judgment, and knowledge of the personnel executing the tests, such as testing a complex intrinsically safe circuit, were not included in the part 7 program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under part 7, all product testing is conducted according to MSHA-specified tests and procedures, using calibrated and accurate instruments. Moreover, the product testing is subject to Agency observation or witnessing. Part 7 is not a self-certification program. The part 7 concept shifts only the testing of certain products to the applicant or a third party. The evaluation of the test results and the issuance of the approval remain the responsibility of the Agency. Under this proposal, part 7 would not be changed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1993, as part of President Clinton's National Performance Review, MSHA initiated a further review of its approval and certification activities, including its part 7 applicant or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party testing program. Based on this review, the Agency reaffirmed the objectives of the part 7 concept to increase post-approval product audits and direct more resources to evaluation of safety and technological improvements in products for use underground. However, MSHA determined that while the part 7 program was a step in the right direction, the limited scope of that program did not free up sufficient resources to allow MSHA to fully redirect its efforts to meet those objectives. After considering how best to accomplish those goals, the Agency has decided to initiate rulemaking to modify MSHA's approval program in two ways. First, applicants seeking MSHA product approval would be required to use independent laboratories for the required testing and evaluation. This would be in lieu of MSHA testing and evaluation of products. As with the part 7 program, however, MSHA would continue to verify that approval requirements were met and would retain full responsibility for issuing the product approval. Thus, this proposed modified approach would not constitute a self-certification program. Second, MSHA or appropriately recognized independent laboratories would be permitted, upon an applicant's request, to test and evaluate a product for approval based on approval requirements other than the Agency's, as long as those requirements provide an equal or greater degree of protection. This would allow MSHA to approve a product meeting the International Electrotechnical Commission's (IEC) approval standards, or some other approval requirements different from those specified in MSHA's regulations, provided that MSHA had determined previously that those requirements were equivalent or could be enhanced to provide protection equivalent to that afforded by products tested and evaluated according to MSHA approval requirements. In this way, the Agency could take advantage of revisions to product approval standards developed by other countries or standards development organizations to address technological advances or improvements in product safety. Such an approach would permit the introduction of a wider variety of improved products into U.S. mines more quickly than if the Agency had to undertake rulemaking to address each technological advance or improvement in product safety, capability, and performance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Discussion of Proposed Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 6.10&blank;Use of Independent Laboratories  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule, which would require applicants to use independent laboratories to perform the product testing and evaluation necessary for issuance of MSHA's product approval, is intended to form the foundation of a modified approval program providing enhanced product user protection and more rapid introduction of new technology into the mining industry. This modified approval program would require applicants for product approval to submit to MSHA, along with their application and product drawings and specifications, the test and evaluation data and results developed by a qualified independent laboratory in addition to the laboratory's statement of product conformance with MSHA testing and evaluation requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In deciding to propose such a modification to its approval program, the Agency concluded that it was essential for the laboratories performing testing and evaluation to be recognized under some type of accreditation program. The existence of three accreditation programs administered by the U.S. Government led MSHA to decide to use one of these programs rather than establish its own program and duplicate the work of others. The three programs considered were:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) National Voluntary Conformity Assessment System Evaluation (NV CASE) program, 15 CFR part 286;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) NIST's National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NV LAP), 15 CFR part 285; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory Program (NRTL), 29 CFR 1910.7.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NV CASE program became effective on May 23, 1994. As of July 1994, NIST had received only one letter expressing possible interest in establishing a specific program under NV CASE. Therefore, no organization which determines the conformity of products to technical regulations based on testing and evaluation; i.e., a conformity assessment body, has yet been accredited by NIST under the NV CASE program. Moreover, as indicated by NIST in the preamble to the final rule for NV CASE, the program was intended to assist U.S. manufacturers in demonstrating that their products meet other countries' technical requirements for export purposes. Accrediting an organization to determine the conformity of products with domestic regulatory requirements, such as MSHA's product approval regulations, was specifically stated to be outside the scope of the NV CASE program. Therefore, NV CASE is not suitable for MSHA's purposes in this rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Italians in Polish steel venture A Dollars 300m (Pounds 175.4m) joint venture agreement between Lucchini, the Italian steel-maker, and the Huta Warszawa steel mill is set to go ahead, after an overwhelming vote this week by the plant's employees to approve the scheme. The deal with Poland's most important quality-steels producer is the first big foreign investment in eastern Europe's steel industry. The local authority where the mill is located has voted to end its opposition to a land settlement accompanying the venture. This fulfils the last condition Lucchini had set for signing the agreement. The deal foresees a Dollars 200m modernisation plan for the mill, to be followed by a further Dollars 100m investment in its rolling mill. The aim is for the plant to produce 600,000 tonnes of quality steels a year. The vote this week by 99 per cent of the 4,700-strong workforce signified acceptance of a phased wage-rise scheme offered by Lucchini which would almost double the present Zloty 2.2m (Pounds 88) average monthly wage by the end of next year. The International Finance Corporation, the World Bank affiliate which concentrates on private-sector investments, is providing Dollars 37.2m in loans and Dollars 5m equity in the project. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is providing a further Dollars 37.2m loan; another Dollars 79.2m is to be provided by SACE, the Italian trade insurance corporation. Poland has not supplied any weapons or military spare parts to Russia this year, Mr Jan Straus, the Polish government's top arms-trade official, said yesterday. The arms sales ban followed Russia's failure to pay for Dollars 244m worth of deliveries last year. Poland sold another Dollars 140m worth of military equipment to other countries in 1991, Mr Straus said.</p>

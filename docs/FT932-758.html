			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: The best and worst share performers  -Philip Coggan and Scheherazade Daneshkhu see some surprising falls from grace in the first-half of the year FOR MUCH of the last decade, a good stock market adage was 'keep taking the tablets.' Buying shares in pharmaceutical companies was what the Americans call a no-brainer: a decision requiring little thought. The rationale was that ageing populations in the West and increasingly sophisticated medical techniques were leading to ever-rising healthcare costs. The scale of research and development needed to produce new drugs prevented companies from entering the market and led to high margins for those that remained. As recently as 1991, Wellcome and Glaxo were the best performing shares in the FT-SE 100 Index. But in the first half of 1993, the no-brainers turned into no-gainers. Glaxo and Wellcome were the worst performing FT-SE shares and other drugs related stocks, such as Boots and Smithkline Beecham, also feature in the laggards list. The primary reason for the fall is the Clinton administration's plans to reform the US healthcare system, which has hit pharmaceutical companies on both sides of the Atlantic. Add some company-specific problems - worries about Wellcome's anti-Aids drug, the departure of Glaxo's chief executive - and you have the scope for a share price decline. A more fundamental factor also came into play. As the UK economy recovers, investors start to desert the solid, dependable stocks that saw them through the recession and start to move into 'cyclical' shares. Profits of such companies were battered by the recession and investors reason that the rebound will therefore be all the sharper. Many of the best performing FT-SE shares of the first half fall into the 'recovery' category. British Aerospace may have announced a Pounds 1.2bn loss, but it paid a larger than expected dividend and showed signs of rebounding from the disasters of last year, when its share price (now around Pounds 4) touched 107p. It rejoined the FT-SE 100 index at the start of June. British Steel was due for a revival, having been one of the 10 worst performing Footsie stocks in both 1991 and 1992. The first half share price surge came in spite of the announcement of a Pounds 149m loss for the year ended April 3, the company's worst result since privatisation in 1988. The devaluation of the pound has improved the company's outlook, as has its ability to announce, and maintain, price rises. But the shares, sought after at privatisation for their dividend-paying ability, now yield just 1.2 per cent. Asda is another stock on the rebound. It performed so badly in 1991 that it was dropped from the FT-SE 100 index, but last year its shares rose 50 per cent and it has climbed back in. The supermarket group managed to be one of the best performing shares of the first half in spite of a Pounds 347m rights issue in January. Smaller rather than larger companies have provided the best returns in the first half. The FT-SE 100 index is up just 1.7 per cent over the period to June 25; the All-Share has done little better, with a rise of 4.7 per cent. The recently created FT Small Cap index, covering the smallest 450 stocks in the All-Share, jumped a more than healthy 20.7 per cent. Small company shares had underperformed for four consecutive years between 1989 and 1992 - their worst recorded run. The very factors that hurt them during the recession - their exposure to the UK economy, the lack of liquidity in the shares - are helping them in brighter economic times. The tables show the best and worst performing stocks in the All-Share as well as in the FT-SE 100 index. As with their larger brethren, many of these are 'recovery' stocks. Often, however, long-term shareholders may not have had that much cause for cheer. Some of the companies merely regained ground lost in 1992. Take the best performing stock, Baltic, a small leasing group, which saw its share price rise from 26p on January 1 to 89p on Thursday night. This sounds like good news for its shareholders until you realise that the price plummeted last year from 123p to 24p in the space of seven months after fears of bad debt provisions when it withdrew from construction equipment leasing and aircraft financing. By contrast, Danka business systems, the US-based office equipment supplier, has seen rapid growth this year after a series of acquisitions. Pre-tax profits were up by 63 per cent in the year to March 31 due to pent-up demand for office equipment and the restructuring of many of its businesses. Smith New Court, one of London's leading marketmakers, which this week reported pre-tax profits up up 110 per cent on last year, has seen its share price more than double in the first half of the year on the back of increased turnover in the markets. The profits ensured a warm welcome for its Pounds 41.2m rights issue on Thursday, with the share price rising 35p to close at 285p at the end of the day. A sudden spate of buying in Ratners, the heavily indebted jewellery group, since April has led to a steep increase in the share price but analysts have found it difficult to explain why the shares have become so popular. There is less mystery behind the woes of Hartstone, the hosiery and leather goods company, which saw its share price slide this year from 272p on February 22 to 34p at Thursday's close. The company has been hit by the deepening recession in Europe. Other consumer goods companies to have done badly included Spring Ram, the Yorkshire manufacturer of kitchens, bathrooms and home improvement products. In March it announced a fall in last year's pre-tax profits to Pounds 26.2m, well below expectations of Pounds 39m. The fall was attributed to difficult trading conditions and the same factor was blamed by Campari, the sporting leisure wear group, which in May made its second profits warning in less than two months, and by Jeyes, the cleaning products group. Its profits warning earlier this month caused the share price to fall 122p in one day to 317p and it now languishes at 283p. Two companies in the engineering sector have suffered. BM group's troubles began last summer when its share price collapsed after loss of confidence following the resignation of Roger Shute, its founding chairman. It has been involved in refinancing talks with its bankers after mounting debts and losses. Simon Engineering also had a bad year in 1992 and its problems have continued. In March, the company announced that pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 18.3m to Pounds 5.32m in the year to December, mainly due to the recession and losses on a paper engineering contract. A profits warning in May triggered further falls. Where will the winners come in the second half? Michael Beggs, who manages a recovery fund for Guinness Flight, argues that the first phase is over - a fair amount of recovery is built into share prices and one can no longer pick up stocks at bargain valuations. The next phase is to identify the companies which have done the hard work of reorganisation and restructuring and which will benefit from the economic recovery.  -------------------------------------------------      TOP PERFORMING FT-SE 100 STOCKS JAN-JUNE  ------------------------------------------------- Company                                 % gain  ------------------------------------------------- British Aerospace                        141.8 British Steel                             71.3 Asda                                      41.7 Royal Bank of Scot                        39.3 Standard Chartered                        36.8 Powergen                                  34.2 HSBC                                      32.8 RMC                                       31.9 S G Warburg                               31.3 Land Securities                           30.8  ------------------------------------------------- Source: Datastream.  -------------------------------------------------         WORST PERFORMING FT-SE 100 STOCKS  ------------------------------------------------- Company                                 % fall  ------------------------------------------------- Wellcome                                 -29.3 Glaxo                                    -27.7 Bass                                     -22.4 Boots                                    -20.8 Allied-Lyons                             -16.1 Argyll                                   -15.1 Reckitt &amp; Colman                         -13.8 Smithkline Beecham                       -13.5 BAT                                      -12.9 Smith &amp; Nephew                           -12.3  ------------------------------------------------- Source: Datastream.  -------------------------------------------------         BEST PERFORMING ALL-SHARE STOCKS  ------------------------------------------------- Company                                 % gain  ------------------------------------------------- Baltic                                   242.3 Danka Business Systems                   172.3 ASW Holdings                             154.9 Ratners                                  152.9 Smith New Court                          147.8 British Aerospace                        141.8 WPP                                      114.3 Wace                                     108.1 Scottish Met Property                    105.6 Hall Engineering                         100.0  ------------------------------------------------- Source: Datastream.  -------------------------------------------------         WORST PERFORMING ALL-SHARE STOCKS  ------------------------------------------------- Company                                 % fall  ------------------------------------------------- Hartstone                                -84.3 BM                                       -71.2 Simon Engineering                        -63.5 Spring Ram                               -57.1 Campari                                  -53.7 Dalepak                                  -44.9 Herring Baker Harris                     -44.5 Sims Food                                -44.0 Anglo United                             -43.3 Jeyes                                    -39.8  ------------------------------------------------- Source: Datastream.  -------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] On the afternoon of 25 April, the same day that  Tsutomu Hata, chairman of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], was  elected in the Diet as the next prime minister, some ruling  coalition parties formed the Kaishin parliamentary group. In  reacting against the parties' formation of the parliamentary  group, the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] then broke  away from the coalition. The "post-Hosokawa political  situation" is plunging the entire political world into great  chaos and is leaving open the possibility of a second  realignment of the established political parties. The discord  over formation of the parliamentary group is creating a ripple  within Shinseito, which has so far boasted of its cohesion, and  is creating the possibility that the Japan New Party [JNP] will  split again. Mr. Hata, who was elected prime minister in the  Diet but who has yet to form his cabinet, is still unable to  inaugurate his government. The functioning of politics is in a  state of complete paralysis.    Five political parties and a group including Shinseito  formed  the parliamentary group, but the parliamentary group hit a snag  just one day after it was formed. In reacting strongly to moves  by the five political parties and a group to form the  parliamentary group without prior consultations, the SDPJ broke  away from the coalition. The Hata government thus would remain a  minority in the Diet without the SDPJ and the foundation of the  Hata government would be unstable. Moves are afoot to explore  ways to scrap the parliamentary group. Shinseito Secretary  General Ichiro Ozawa is coming under a barrage of criticism from  some Shinseito members for promoting the formation of the  parliamentary group while keeping key senior Shinseito members  in the dark about it. The formation of the parliamentary group  may trigger another split of the JNP. [passage omitted on  meeting of Shinseito]    The Shinseito members who had prior knowledge of the  formation of the parliamentary group, which was done on 25  April, were only Mr. Ozawa; Hiroshi Kumagai, minister of  international trade and industry; and Sadao Hirano, a member of  the House of Councilors. Mr. Toshio Yamaguchi is said to have  been involved in the formation of the parliamentary group, and  his involvement has sparked anger among Shinseito members, which  is adding fuel to fire.    A senior Shinseito member said bluntly, "No matter what Mr.  Ozawa does from now on, we no longer trust him." The "Ozawa  myth" has been abruptly tarnished.    The JNP, which is led by former Prime Minister Hosokawa, is  in a more serious situation. Discord is growing between the  party executive, including Secretary General Matsuoka, who has  ridden the wave of the Ozawa-Hosokawa alliance, and  antiexecutive members. The formation of the parliamentary group  is becoming the seeds of fresh intraparty strife. Dozens of JNP  members including Mr. Takashi Kawamura met in Tokyo on the  evening of 26 April. During the meeting, they decided to ask  the executive to shelve the parliamentary group and they termed  the process of forming the parliamentary group absurdly hasty.    Three legislators who recently quit the Japan New Party have  formed the Group Seiun, and this group and some junior  antiexecutive legislators are rumored to be planning to join  Sakigake [Harbinger].    In this situation, acting Shinseito Secretary General Kozo  Watanabe told a meeting of Shinseito legislators on 26 April:  "Former Prime Minister Hosokawa and Chairman Ouchi of the  Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] have proposed forming a  parliamentary group while calling on Shinseito to join the  group. The proposal was made when the ruling coalition parties  discussed choosing Mr. Hata to be prime minister. Shinseito  responded gratefully to the proposal and decided to accept it."    Commenting on the formation of the parliamentary group, the  notification of which was made to the Diet on 25 April when Mr.  Hata was elected in the Diet as the next prime minister, a  leader of the DSP stressed that the parliamentary group was  formed on Shinseito's initiative, saying, "A veteran Shinseito  politician who is well versed in Diet affairs has insisted on  forming the parliamentary group, and our party acceded to his  insistence."    Moves are spreading within Shinseito to "make efforts to  seek  an understanding with the SDPJ by scrapping the parliamentary  group." According to a senior Shinseito member, "Mr. Ozawa  thinks only of a frontal breakthrough" and his obstinacy is  keeping the political situation deadlocked.</p>

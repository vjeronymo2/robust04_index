			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Economy 'bad and getting worse' says CBI A FRESH wave of gloom over Britain's economic prospects cast further doubt yesterday on government claims that the recession will begin to lift later this year. Mr John Banham, director general of the Confederation of British Industry, claimed parts of manufacturing industry were now in a slump, with order books in many sectors lower than in any post-war period. His remarks came as the British Chambers of Commerce and the Engineering Employers' Federation also said the recession remained firmly entrenched. Mr Banham added that the state of the overall economy was 'bad and getting worse', a picture that will be confirmed when the CBI publishes its quarterly trends survey next week. His comments, which followed the Institute of Directors' criticism on Tuesday of the government's handling of the economy, were noticeably less optimistic than last month, when he said the economy appeared to have 'ticked up noticeably'. Mr Banham emphasised that the rate of deterioration was slowing and that factory gate price rises, together with the rate of pay settlements, had fallen markedly. But he said that without further, early cuts in interest rates the prospects for economic revival remained poor. Although the CBI agrees with Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, that the economy should begin to recover in the second half of the year, Mr Banham said it would be 'well towards the end of the year' before any improvement became widespread. The British Chambers of Commerce delivered the first survey of business confidence since Mr Lamont's announcement that he intended to pay more attention to such soundings in assessing the shape of economic recovery. The survey showed that the economy plunged further into recession during the first quarter of this year, with the service sector rapidly following manufacturing industry into sharp decline. The British Chambers of Commerce added that any end to the recession remained 'faint and elusive'. Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, led a renewed Labour attack on the government's economic record, claiming the survey provided further evidence that the economy was in 'a deep and damaging recession'. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow trade and industry secretary, demanded that Mr John Major should 'wake up to the damage his economic policies are doing countrywide'. The Engineering Employers' Federation added to the bleak picture, following publication of its own survey suggesting that the engineering sector was unlikely to experience any recovery until the middle of next year. With output, productivity, employment and exports all dropping, a further 90,000 engineering jobs could be lost over the next year, it said. Lex, Page 22 Engineering slide, Page 8</p>

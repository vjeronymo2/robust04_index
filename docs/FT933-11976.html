			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Letter: Perverse satisfaction in alienating audience Sir, Even if I had not been in the audience of Julian Grant's opera, A Family Affair, I still might have felt obliged to write about Max Loppert's performance in print ('Not so comic capers', July 10). The stridency of his tone more than drowns out the work he so bitterly criticises and the libretto of his dialogue is itself worthy of music. After all, it is Mr Loppert who suggests that A Family Affair is too good even to need music, making the case, therefore, that the music of an opera is best matched to an unworthy libretto. Among the serious music crowd, there seems to be perverse satisfaction taken in the alienation of the audience from the music. Such elitism is ironic, indeed, since most people subscribing to the inaccessibility of the arts fancy themselves very much of the people. The greatest fear is popularity which is seen as the steep and slippery slide to Lloyd-Webberism. The reception of Grant's work highlights the victimisation of opera audiences intimidated into enduring the personal statements of precious composers by the musical poobahs who all too often applaud these composers' new clothes. Ironically, the critics of modern music have become the very establishment from whom they claim to protect us; thus, the revolutionary archaism of A Family Affair poses so great a threat because it connects directly with the audience, thereby sweeping aside the cultural vigilantes who tell us they know best.

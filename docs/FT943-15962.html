			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Andreotti may face new charge Palermo magistrates are pressing for more serious charges to be brought against Mr Giulio Andreotti, former Italian prime minister, over his alleged links to the Mafia, in an attempt to retain control over the highly sensitive investigation into the ageing Christian Democrat politician. The original charge against Mr Andreotti claimed he had links with the Mafia. Palermo magistrates are now understood to want to change this to an allegation that, by providing political proection for Cosa Nostra, the umbrella organisation of the Sicilian Mafia, he was in effect part of the criminal organisation. Mr Andreotti has denied the charge and through his lawyers is fighting to have the case removed from Palermo to Rome, his home base, where he believes he will obtain a more sympathetic hearing. However, the more serious crime is alleged to have taken place in Palermo and thus comes under that city's jurisdiction. 'The important thing is that I have nothing to do with the Mafia and on this point no public prosectutor or law court could prove the contrary,' the 73-year-old Mr Andreotti said yesterday. Former Mafia members now co-operating with the authorities under witness protection allege that Mr Andreotti provided political cover for Cosa Nostra and that several of his key political lieutenants in Sicily were members of the Mafia.</p>

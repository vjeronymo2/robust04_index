			<p><P> October 3, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAUDI CUSTOMS OFFICIALS DAMAGING TRUCKS AT BORDER, JORDANIANS CHARGE  </P> <P> Jordanian truck drivers claimed Wednesday that Saudi Arabian customs officials  were damaging their trucks as Persian Gulf politics continued to sour relations  between the two countries.  </P> <P> The dispute, too new to do any serious damage to either side, nevertheless  underlines the Arab divisions over the gulf crisis and the proliferating  problems they are causing. Officials in Amman and Riyadh dodged comment on the  controversy, but the evidence was clear at their frontier.  </P> <P> According to Jordanian truck drivers at the Umari border crossing, Saudi  customs men were damaging their vehicles for no reason.  </P> <P> "They were spiking holes through the (aluminum) skins of our trailers without  even opening the doors to see what we were carrying," a Jordanian driver told a  photographer on the scene.  </P> <P> The cross-border trucking dispute involved traffic going both ways. According  to officials in Amman, it began with Saudi harassment of Jordanian trucks  returning from the gulf, and local Jordanian officials responded by stopping  their own vehicles as well as trucks from Syria and Lebanon, both Saudi  supporters in the gulf crisis.  </P> <P> Jordanian officials in Amman said the drivers, carrying fresh fruit and  vegetables to Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf states, had been harassed by  the Saudis for the last two days. The dispute follows Saudi decisions to cut  off oil supplies to Jordan and oust Jordanian diplomats from Riyadh.  </P> <P> "It's nickels and dimes," a Western diplomat said in Amman on Tuesday night --  but it illustrated the hard Saudi attitude against any country that tilts  toward Iraq.  </P> <P> The Jordanian government has endorsed United Nations resolutions demanding an  Iraqi withdrawal and economic sanctions, but popular sentiment in Jordan  remains strongly pro-Iraqi. The dispute started last week, coming to a head  over the weekend when Jordanian border officials said alleged Saudi harassment  of their trucks led to the decision to block the border traffic, including  Syrian and Lebanese trucks.  </P> <P> The vast majority of fresh vegetables and fruits reaching Saudi Arabia and the  gulf states comes through Jordan. One report said the border tie-up has doubled  the price of imported fruit in the United Arab Emirates.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Japan, U.S. Urged To Return To Starting Point"] </F>   [Text] "Super 301 Provision" is a popular name used to  refer to the 301 provision of the Omnibus Trade Law of the  United States. It was approved by Congress, where the Democratic  Party held the majority, only for a two-year period, 1989-90,  because the then Republican administration was negative about  invoking the provision, which calls for sanctions against unfair  trade partners.    Activation of the 301 provision is planned if negotiations  by  the U.S. Trade Representative, after it one-sidedly determines  unfair trade partners and unfair areas of trade, fail to produce  agreements. It is highly possible that the Super 301 provision  is against the GATT, which prescribes international trade rules.    President Clinton revived this ill-famed provision by  issuing  an executive order. During his presidential campaign two years  ago, Clinton pledged that he would revive the provision.  However, we have to say that the decision to enact the  provision at this time is nothing but an act to apply pressure  on, and to force Japan to, make compromises at the new  Japan-U.S. economic talks, which are currently ruptured.    The President might have decided to revive the Super 301  while considering U.S. congressional intentions and other  matters. However, we cannot understand the bullish manner of  threatening trade partners, saying that retaliation will be  imposed if you do not compromise. It was a matter of course for  the Japanese Government to file a strong protest against this  decision.    Nevertheless, the Japanese Government should not end this as  a mere chorus of criticism against the United States. It seems  that the United States does not want to develop this into a  trade war. In addition to other measures he took, the President  called Prime Minister Hosokawa and explained the circumstances.    It is indispensable for the government to remain calm, to do  whatever it has to do to improve the situation, while pointing  out the unreasonableness of the United States. The government  should exert its positive efforts to enrich contents of new  market liberalization measures.    We believe that it is important for the government to go  back  to the starting point and review the reasons why the new trade  talks started.    Discussions on whether or not an introduction of "numerical  targets" is right, overshadowed the Japan-U.S. discussions,  which have been held since September last year. However, we are  certain that Japan pledged the following two points at a meeting  held last July between former Prime Minister Miyazawa and  President Clinton: 1) that, as a medium-range target, Japan will  make a "quite significant reduction of it's trade surplus"; and  2) that Japan will introduce market-opening measures in several  fields, including automobiles and auto parts, and to establish  "objective criteria to measure outcomes of the market-opening  measures.    Speaking of reducing the trade surplus, it is viewed as a  rough criteria to lower the trade surplus to about 2 percent of  Japan's gross domestic product (GDP) in three or four years.    The ratio grew to as high as 3.8 percent in the quarter  between January and March last year. After that, it dropped to  3 percent during between July and September due to a rapid  appreciation of the yen. As a matter of fact, the government,  in its economic preview for fiscal 1994, predicted the rate to  drop to 2.8 percent. What do we need to do to make this trend  of decline take root?    It is important to increase imports by stimulating domestic  demands. However, we have no choice but to change the Japanese  economic structure, which can survive only by exporting far more  goods than it imports. We are of the opinion that the Hosokawa  cabinet has to change the economic structure while accepting a  strong yen, which is a product of the trade surplus, and to map  out action plans with clear political intentions.    It is worthwhile to study the possibility of launching  policies -- such as spelling out future tax reductions to be  introduced after next fiscal year, additional measures of the  10-year plan for public investments, and concrete deregulations  measures -- which are easy to understand and will be highly  assessed by international society.    Regarding negotiations in individual fields, it is said that  considerable progress has already been made in the fields of  government procurement and insurance services. The auto  industry has begun to prepare voluntary plans to expand its  purchases of [foreign] auto parts.    In a news conference after the Japan-U.S. summit, President  Clinton touched on the objective criteria issue and showed his  flexible stance by clearly stating: "We are not asking for  something like the Japan-U.S. semiconductor accord." We hope  that both countries will show wisdom and put the negotiations  back into orbit by making such a remark upon occasion to break  the deadlock.</p>

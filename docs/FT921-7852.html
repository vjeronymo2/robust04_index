			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (16): Davids subsidise cash flow of Goliaths - Friction between makers and dealers ONE OF the less pleasant aspects of a recession for many smaller businesses is the way in which it mysteriously starts taking longer for large companies to which they are suppliers - and on which, obviously, they are dependent - to settle their accounts. Effectively, it is a case of David subsidising Goliath's cash flow. The Davids will not be at all pleased to learn that they could well be subsidising Goliath's fleet of company cars as well. The report which highlights this possibility was commissioned by the Retail Motor Industry Federation. In ordering the hefty, 200-page study* from consultants Harbour Wade and Professor Jonathan Brown, research professor in retail management at Brighton Business School, the RMI was more concerned with the welfare of the 7,500 franchised car dealers who form the bedrock of its membership than end users. It was seeking mainly to identify the extent to which car makers, ever anxious to 'move metal', have been by-passing their franchised dealers - through which all sales should theoretically be made - to sell directly to the big fleets. It concluded that at least 200,000 such sales are being made annually and, for some particularly large and favoured fleets, at discounts sometimes reaching as high as 40 per cent. That is considerably more than double most franchised car dealers' own official profit margins, which are typically around 16 per cent. Since, in the present depressed UK car market, most dealers in volume cars would be happy to retain 6 or 7 per cent of their margin even to private customers, it is hardly surprising that the main burden of the report was that such sales stand to undermine dealer viability and perhaps result in the disintegration of the franchised dealer system itself. However, it is the effect that these deeply-discounted cars have when they emerge two, three or four years later into the used car market - in other words their residual values - which is of most relevance to smaller businesses and to an even greater extent by private buyers. Cars bought at considerably less discount, typically 8 to 12.5 per cent for volume cars, still form most of the market and represent the level of discount available to reasonably persistent private and small company buyers. If this were to be the maximum discount level, as is the case in many other markets where the fleet influence is less pervasive, residual values for a given car, age and mileage would be relatively equitable. The 'drag-down' in residual value suffered by the private buyer, receiving least discount, caused by the lower price a company might accept for its used cars bought at a higher discount, would be relatively insignificant. The way things work at present in the UK, however, is seen as altogether more damaging. At least 200,000 cars, bought at 25, 30 or even 40 per cent discount, finding their way back into the used car market are likely to have a noticeable impact, particularly in a market where last year only 1.59m new cars were sold. Naturally, the big fleet operators selling them could accept much lower prices in the used car market yet, proportionately, suffer no worse from depreciation than the private or small company buyer. The point is, however, that they do not have to. Because the bulk of the used car market is still made up of relatively less discounted cars, the residual value contained within the trade guides which motor traders themselves use as their 'bibles', Glass's Guide and the CAP Black Book, will mainly reflect depreciation on these vehicles. However,the extra availability of very deeply discounted cars in such numbers undoubtedly reduces the value of the private or small company's cars at auction or trade-in time. The additional drop may not be much - perhaps 10 per cent. But it is still a loss which would not arise in the absence of big direct fleet deals. In contrast, the daily rental company which bought 20,000 cars direct from the manufacturer, at a discount of 30 per cent, is laughing all the way to the auction block. Not only did it buy the cars cheaply, but courtesy of the private buyer and small company sector, it is benefitting from much higher residual values than if everybody had been able to buy at a similar discount. Once again, David is subsiding Goliath. As the RMI research found, there is a lot of money at stake. Its statistics demonstrate that, on average, private buyers in 1990/early 1991 received a discount of Pounds 575. That rose to Pounds 750 in the case of small company fleets of two to 24 cars; Pounds 1,140 per car for fleets of 25-100; Pounds 1,365 for 100-plus fleets; Pounds 1,870 for small daily rental fleets and a full Pounds 2,000 for the rental market 'majors'. Accusations that manufacturers have consistently increased new car prices by more than the rate of inflation, in part to create a higher base from which to discount heavily to the fleets, already form part of the investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission into new car prices in the UK, and how they are influenced by the system of exclusively franchised dealer. If the RMI study is right, and the franchised dealer system really is under threat from being by-passed, that too, it is argued, would have considerable implications for all business car buyers. 'We consider that its replacement by a largely unstructured supply organisation would not work in the interests of consumers, customers or manufacturers. There would be a significant downscaling and reduction of investment by dealer networks, which would affect national coverage, quality and standards,' the report's authors conclude. As the end of January neared, the big question appeared to be: would the MMC itself agree? * The Fleet Sector and Direct Sales. Harbour Wade partners and Prof Jonathan Brown.

			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / New faces on the box: Changes in South African broadcasting Authoritarian governments do one thing best: they teach people to take orders, and to like it. Nowhere is the habit of subservience more damaging than in the newsroom of the state broadcaster. Until four years ago, few broadcasters anywhere in the former totalitarian world could rival the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) for slavish adherence to the ruling party line. Now the SABC has a new chairman who is black, a woman and anything but a supporter of the National party. In a society which has been moulded almost as much by male chauvinism as by racial discrimination, the appointment of Mrs Ivy Matsepe-Casaburri is a seminal event. She will be at the helm of an institution which has served as a loyal hand maiden to the National party since it took power in 1948 until the day, four decades later, when it decided to end apartheid. Mrs Matsepe-Casaburri will occupy one of the hottest seats in the country. With South Africa's first multiracial elections expected next year, all political parties agree that an independent SABC is crucial to a fair poll. Within months, the corporation is to come under the scrutiny of an Independent Media Commission, chosen by the parties to constitutional negotiations, and charged with ensuring fair election coverage. But there are signs that the SABC itself is preparing, not for independence, but for a new kind of servitude. 'The king is dead; long live the king.' South African political columnist Denis Beckett, writing in the Johannesburg Sunday Star, quotes this well-worn phrase to highlight his worries that SABC staff are already shifting their allegiance from one political master to another: from the National party to the ANC. Indeed, they seem to share the country's confusion over who is really in charge, obeying both masters by turns but never acting independently. The coverage of events surrounding the assassination of Mr Chris Hani, the African National Congress guerrilla leader, was a case in point: SABC television aired what can only be described as a hagiographical portrait of Mr Hani - a man demonised by the National party - and allowed the ANC to dictate some of the coverage surrounding his death. On the eve of a national day of mourning, SABC agreed to broadcast on prime-time news a three-minute appeal for calm from Mr Nelson Mandela, ANC leader. When Mr Mandela delivered an eight-minute pre-recorded video, the TV editors halved it, to howls of outrage from the ANC, which insisted it be broadcast again in full. The SABC complied. SABC editors insist they were acting in the national interest in bowing to ANC pressure. But as media lawyer Mr David Dison points out, the SABC understands the national interest to mean the interests of the government of the day - or in this case the government in waiting. For in the old South Africa, government always knew best. Prof Gavin Stewart, head of the school of journalism at Rhodes University, believes that religion as well as politics conspired to create a sycophantic culture at the SABC. 'That's built into the Calvinist culture (of the Afrikaner) - you believe your leaders are ordained by God, and you can't help but pass on that attitude to the new leaders.' In any event, the news culture of the SABC has improved since President P W Botha left office in 1989. He personally interfered in its news coverage on a regular basis. The ANC and other black political organisations, banned by Pretoria, were never heard on air. Since Mr Botha's departure, ANC speakers appear almost nightly, along with representatives of the far left and right. And SABC staff say they no longer receive direct telephone calls from the president. But SABC news continues to reflect undue deference to the presidential viewpoint. One example, of central importance, was the SABC's coverage of the appointment of its own new board of governors. The appointment provoked a political dogfight between the ANC and the government, after President de Klerk twice vetoed the list of 25 board members recommended by an independent panel of jurists. But rather than reflect this dogfight on TV, by pitting Mr de Klerk against an ANC representative in live debate, SABC chose to give the president an easy ride from a tame interviewer, who did not even ask the president why he had vetoed the panel's black nominee as chairman, Professor Njabulo Ndebele, in favour of a white Afrikaner, who subsequently resigned in protest. Mrs Matsepe-Casaburri, who was previously deputy chairman, was finally appointed last week as chairman as a compromise candidate. But if the president emerged from the SABC board fiasco looking like a brute  -he forced the replacement of several ANC-leaning nominees by anonymous Afrikaners of questionable credentials - the ANC looked scarcely better. Despite the fact that ANC officials had agreed that the president should have final veto over nominees, they claimed foul play when he used it. Over time, the board may succeed at building credibility. But no board, however pure, can revolutionise overnight the culture of an organisation with 5,000 employees, 22 radio stations, 12.5m radio listeners and 8.8m daily viewers for its three television channels. The ANC has called for an 'iron broom' to sweep Afrikaner dominance from SABC newsrooms; and important changes will need to be made at the top, where virtually every senior editorial post is held by an Afrikaner male. The new board has started to address this issue. Affirmative action policies will be pursued. Priority will be given to blacks in filling top and middle management posts that fall vacant in the next 18 months. But it may be easier said than done. With the SABC as monopoly broadcaster for 57 years, there are few trained broadcasters who did not grow up in the culture of the SABC. That monopoly is now expected to end, with the SABC likely to be unbundled. Commercially viable channels and radio stations could be sold off to private shareholders by a new government. Political parties have agreed that broadcasting in the new South Africa would be regulated by a new independent broadcasting authority, which would allocate many new radio licences to outside broadcasters, and possibly create a commercial TV channel. Deregulation will naturally multiply the number of independent news sources, and reduce the potential for government control. But broadcasting experts say the market may be too small to support another commercial television station, meaning the SABC would remain in effective control of TV. If it remains a monopoly, the risk is that a new government - faced with the political instability expected to plague the first years of the new South Africa - would eventually be tempted to abuse the SABC again. With that in prospect, viewers would do well to enjoy the present Prague spring; the SABC may never be so free again.</p>

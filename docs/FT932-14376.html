			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Survey of Business Air Travel (2): New competitive forces at work - Western Europe The liberalisation of the European air transport market, coupled with the continuing impact of the general economic slowdown, has had significant repercussions on Europe's airline industry this year. The deregulation of air fares on January 1 has already sparked a price war in Europe. Lufthansa of Germany was the first to take advantage of the new liberal regime in Europe, cutting fares from Germany and the UK. It has been followed by other airlines which have also extended the cuts to business class in an effort to attract higher-yielding customers. British Midland, the second-tier UK carrier, introduced a new business fares policy with price cuts of 30 per cent on its routes from London to other European cities. Price cuts followed at KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and Aer Lingus. Sabena of Belgium launched a season ticket for regular business travellers on its services from the UK to Brussels while Swissair last month inaugurated its new business class cabin with bigger and more comfortable seats. Air France is offering reductions on its European business class while British Airways is promoting its new European services from London's Gatwick airport following its acquisition of Dan-Air last year. As Sir Michael Bishop, the chairman of British Midland, recently put it: 'Battle has at last been joined on Europe's busiest air routes'. Under the EC's third and most radical phase of liberalisation of European air travel, airlines are now free to set their fares according to their own commercial judgment rather than by regulators. Although there are still some transitional restrictions for cabotage or services operated by an airline from one country in a different state, EC-licenced carriers are free to fly on virtually any route in the Community. 'With the introduction of the third package, I believe what has happened is nothing short of a revolution, albeit a relatively peaceful one,' says Mr John MacGregor, the UK transport secretary. Until the advent of liberalisation, Mr MacGregor says European air services had been carved up between national flag carriers and competition was 'simply not on the agenda'. But in introducing more competition in Europe, the EC has been anxious to avoid the experience of 12 years of deregulation in the US which has seen the industry consolidated around a handful of large carriers. 'In our efforts to free up the market, larger airlines must not be allowed to abuse their privileged position and the interests of smaller airlines must be safeguarded,' insists Mr MacGregor. The UK is particularly concerned that the new single EC aviation market will be distorted by governments continuing to support financially their respective national flag carriers. 'Cash injections made to state-owned airlines on terms not available in the private sector risk placing private sector airlines at a distinct competitive disadvantage,' Mr MacGregor argues. The UK also believes the existing EC guidelines to evaluate state aid to airlines are outdated and need to be reinforced. Another significant problem threatening to undermine competition is the question of providing smaller airlines and new entrants with adequate access at busy airports. This issue has become acute because European air travel continues to be plagued by congestion both in the sky and on the ground at some large airports such as London Heathrow or Frankfurt. One solution to these problems is the modernisation and harmonisation of Europe's inadequate air traffic control systems as well as the construction of new airport terminals and runways. But efforts to improve air traffic control and provide more ground infrastructure have been handicapped by frustratingly long lead times. The construction of a fifth terminal at Heathrow, for example, is expected to take at least 10 years from the planning application, which was filed this year, to completion. In the meantime, new airlines are scrambling to gain take-off and landing slots at Heathrow while the established carriers at the airport are jealously guarding their positions. The EC has introduced fresh regulations to ensure that new entrants are given the opportunity to operate services out of congested airports. The system is based on giving them priority on new slots when these become available. However, smaller airlines have continued to complain that access at busy airports will remain a problem so long as established carriers through their so-called 'grandfather rights' are entitled to claim automatically the same slots from one season to another. 'Aviation's most common competition killer is historical precedence,' says Mr Richard Branson, chairman of Virgin Atlantic. 'The rule makers ensure their own failure by continuing to tolerate the allocation of scarce resources on the basis of who had them first: that guarantees that nothing can change,' he says. Mr Branson, whose airline has specialised on long-haul services, says he would be interested in operating short-haul European services if he could secure the necessary, competitive slots at Heathrow. The new competitive forces now at work in the European airline industry are putting increasing pressure on smaller airlines and accelerating the growing trend of consolidation in the industry. The big European carriers have already been positioning themselves in what they regard is rapidly becoming a global airline market by acquiring stakes and forging alliances and partnerships with other international carriers. BA has bought minority stakes in USAir and Qantas as well as stakes in small European airlines to strengthen its presence in the EC market. Apart from absorbing Air Inter, the domestic French carrier, and UTA, the French independent long-haul carrier, Air France has acquired stakes in Sabena of Belgium and CSA of Czechoslovakia. Scandinavian Airlines System, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Swissair and Austrian Airlines are in the throes of partnership negotiations which could eventually lead to a merger to form a 'fourth force' in Europe to compete against BA, Air France and Lufthansa of Germany, Europe's big three airlines. Meanwhile, Alitalia has acquired a stake in Malev, the Hungarian carrier, while Iberia is building up its links with Latin American carriers. Smaller carriers continue to see opportunities to operate in niche markets alongside the big airlines. But they are increasingly likely to be pushed into partnership with one of the bigger groups to survive in the longer term. Despite all the EC's efforts to encourage the development of smaller airlines and new entrants, Mr Jan Carlzon, the chief executive of SAS, believes that by the end of the decade the European industry will be dominated by four or five large groups of airlines.</p>

In Egypt, the confrontation between the regime and the  "Islamists," while not reaching the level of violence witnessed  in Algeria, has assumed greater dimensions to include every  level, including the cinema, television, and arts in general.    In addition to the scenes of commotion and pandemonium in  the  streets surrounding the nine movie theaters that began screening  the film a week ago, Interior Minister Major General Hasan  al-Alfi has announced that new television serials will be  screened soon in which "repentant" Islamists will denounce the  "corruption of the extremist thought."    Acting on a presidential decision, the Egyptian authorities  have banned Shaykh 'Umar 'Abd-al-Kafi from delivering sermons at  Asad Ibn-Furat Mosque in al-Duqqi [a Cairo suburb]. The  Egyptian authorities placed the mosque under the supervision of  the Ministry of Awqaf and banned Shaykh 'Abd-al-Kafi from  travelling.    Shaykh 'Abd-al-Kafi was behind the campaign to persuade  movie  and theater actresses to wear the veil. A secular campaign  against him has increased his popularity such that thousands of  people pray behind him every week.    The security forces surrounded Asad Ibn-al-Furat on Friday  [18 March]. The worshippers were surprised to see the director  of al-Awqaf in al-Jizah ascending the pulpit to deliver the  Friday sermon.    A colonel from the State Security Intelligence Department  went to the house of Shaykh 'Abd-al-Kafi and informed him of the  presidential decision to ban him from delivering sermons or  giving religious classes at that mosque or any other.    The day before yesterday Maj. Gen. al-Alfi declared: "Many  of these Islamists have understood the false calls of the  extremist terrorist elements and have returned to society to  resume their life in a normal way." He promised to screen  recorded television interviews with some of the "repenters."    Egyptian state television has given Muslim religious men the  chance to appear on its screen. A few weeks ago, it began  screening a program criticizing the ideas and practices of the  "extremist" Islamists.    Hasan al-Hillawi, a former Islamist leader, issued a  statement the day before yesterday calling on the extremist  organizations to abandon terrorism.    The film "The Terrorist" was written by well-known novelist  Lenin al-Ramli and was directed by Nadir Jalal. The main role  is played by popular comedian 'Adil Imam.    The streets surrounding the nine Cairo movie theaters that  began screening the film a week ago have witnessed scenes of  commotion and congestion. These movie theaters have witnessed  pandemonium among the audience.    The security forces have imposed a tight guard on these  movie  houses in case they are targeted for attack by the Islamic  groups. The film, its title, theme, and action, rejects Islamic  group acts. Film analysts say the film earned $200,000 during  the first three days of its screening, a record figure for the  Egyptian film industry.    The film is accompanied by a large adverstising campaign,  which includes huge placards showing the "terrorist" 'Adil Imam  bearded and carrying a pistol.</p>

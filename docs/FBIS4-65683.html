			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- German exports to the Arab states  increased 2 percent to 15.8 billion German marks [DM] in 1993.  The main importer of German products was Saudi Arabia, which  bought goods worth DM3.6 billion (1992 -- DM4.2 billion) from  Germany, the Federal Economics Ministry stated in Bonn on 19  May. The United Arab Emirates replaced Egypt as second most  important buyer, purchasing goods worth DM2.2 billion (up 26.6  percent). Similarly high growth rates were reached in German  exports to Syria and Lebanon. Exports to Egypt increased 11.8  percent to DM2.1 billion.    German imports from the Arab states only reached the value  of  DM11.2 billion (down 7.3 percent). A good two-thirds of the  imports was crude oil. Even though quantitatively, 1.2 percent  more crude oil was imported, the oil bill decreased by 5.6  percent to DM7.5 billion because of lower crude oil prices.</p>

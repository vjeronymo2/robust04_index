			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with V.F. Shumeyko, chairman of the Russian </F> Federation Federal Assembly Federation Council, by Petr  Karapetyan; place and date not given: "The Army Must Have All  It Needs -- and as a Matter of Priority"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Karapetyan] Vladimir  Filippovich, I would like to ask the following question: Moscow  Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov is constructing a 100-apartment block in  Sevastopol for Russian seamen. In turn, you said during a trip  to Kaliningrad Oblast that the Federation Council would act as  sponsor of the destroyer Nastoychivyy and the naval garrison in  Baltiysk. Sponsorship assistance for the Army is a  long-standing, essential Russian tradition. Absolutely no doubt  about that. But it is no substitute for a clear-cut, thoroughly  thought-out state program for the Army. Do you sense the need  for one?    [Shumeyko] Of course. State social policy in Russia in  general, and in relation to the Army in particular, is based on  a plethora of uncoordinated legislative acts, working directly  or indirectly, so to speak, to provide social security. This is  clearly not enough. We need a social code, and I talked about  this with the president. Boris Nikolayevich suggested that  consideration be given to creating it. We in the Federation  Council are now preparing proposals that are basically aimed at  protecting those strata of the population which are dependent on  the budget. And I will insist on a separate chapter in the code  on state social policy in the Army. After all, it must be  clearly recognized that the Army is a state institution, so who  is going to look after it if not the state? I am firmly of the  opinion that the military must always be socially provided for  and as a matter of priority. Incidentally, the Federation  Council is 67 percent representatives of regional authorities.  And, believe me, their approach to this question is  statesmanlike.    [Karapetyan] Now you say that the Army must have everything  it needs. It would be difficult to find in Russia a statesman  who would not endorse what you say. But when it comes to  practical action, the left hand forgets what the right hand was  doing. In the corridors of power there is constant talk to the  effect that it would not be a bad idea to strip the military of  their privileges. In my opinion, this is no big deal. What  privileges are we talking about, anyway! The need for a state  program to construct housing for servicemen is being called into  question; they are trying to save energy resources at our  expense.... Yet the Russian military earn their daily bread in  Sarajevo, Tajikistan, the Dniester Region, South Ossetia, and  the Ossetian-Ingush conflict zone, as well as in the quiet  provinces and the capital. Permanent danger and hardship.  Indeed, the Russian Army deserves to be treated differently by  the state.    [Shumeyko] The state cannot exist without the Army and I  believe it is a waste of time to debate the subject. So I will  try to set out my own viewpoint as briefly as possible. Of  course, the Army's interests will have to be taken into account  when the state budget is discussed and approved, and it goes  without saying that one should be guided by the principle of  defensive sufficiency, rather than the residual principle.  There are 10 committees in the Federation Council working on  the budget, including the Defense and Security Committee.  Obviously any committee is going to assert its own positions,  but we will not allow the Army's interests to be undermined.  Although I will allow a serious debate. The Army must be fully  provided with budget money and the policy in this case must be a  rigorous one.    [Karapetyan] There is something else the Army desperately  needs, as well as a budget. I am talking about political  stability in Russia. But society is in turmoil again. This time  as a result of rumors about a plot, about a new coup...    [Shumeyko] All this I regard as an attempt to rock the boat.  As for the situation in the country, it seems to me more stable  than last year. Efforts to destabilize the situation through  rumors and provocations were fine once, so to speak. But they  will not work today.    [Karapetyan] Nonetheless, Vladimir Filippovich, the  political background to the economic reforms remains rather  complex. Take, for instance, the results of the local  elections. Is the nomenklatura on its way back?    [Shumeyko] Since you have broached the subject of elections,  I will say that they were marked by a low level of political  activity by voters and a high level of activity by politicians.  Take St. Petersburg, for instance. There were 750 candidates  for 50 deputies' seats there. That is a very large number. The  elections were "prolonged," of course, by country dwellers. In  the cities people are tired of democracy, I would say.  Democracy means elections all the time. People do not see  results, so they do not go to cast their votes, they become less  politically active. In St. Petersburg again the organizers of  one particular rally were expecting to attract 15,000 people.  Some 22 people turned up in the square. As for the return of  the nomenklatura, I must welcome it, in the sense that the  people returning are experienced people, people who know what  they are at.    [Karapetyan] But what influence will they have on the  conduct of the reforms?    [Shumeyko] Local self-government implements laws adopted at  the top. A simple formula and, you will agree, a pretty  reliable one -- it guarantees that reform remains a factor in  Russia's development.    [Karapetyan] But the problem of accord in Russian society is  there nonetheless. By all accounts, work is almost completed on  the agreement "On Achieving Civil Accord." How do you see this?    [Shumeyko] I am familiar with the text. If we carry on  refining it, it will never be signed. There is a principle:  "Excellent is the enemy of good." As it stands, it is a  well-tuned document and I see no reason why it should not be  adopted.    [Karapetyan] Vladimir Filippovich, you recently said you  support the idea of reestablishing the USSR, although not in its  previous form. President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan  talked about creating a Eurasian Union comprising CIS states.  Does this not indicate the possibility of creating a  Commonwealth or Union on the basis of confederative principles  on the territory of the former USSR?    [Shumeyko] My vision is of the reestablishment of an  integrated commonwealth of states, rather than the  reestablishment of the USSR in its pre-perestroyka form. We do  not want rigid borders, we must try to meet one another halfway.  We should be airing this idea right now. I would not describe  the CIS as the optimal form of a commonwealth. Something of the  order of 400 decisions have been adopted in its context and  barely one-fourth has been implemented. The states choose which  they will sign and which they will not. That is not the way to  go about it. We have to get together in a union, and I am not  frightened of the word. Two or three states for a start, say.  The rest are then bound to follow.    [Karapetyan] In the event of integration, what picture do  you have of the commonwealth's armed forces?    [Shumeyko] Even now we could be preparing the ground for the  creation of unified armed forces. But we must at least begin by  instituting a council of the commonwealth countries' defense  ministers. So Russia is compelled to keep 15,000 people on the  territories of sovereign states, including the trouble spots.  It is difficult, it is not good.</p>

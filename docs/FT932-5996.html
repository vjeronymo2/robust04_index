			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Nadir defends Mates in growing row MR ASIL NADIR, the fugitive businessman, has stepped into an embarrassing political row over his connections with Mr Michael Mates, a middle-ranking minister. Mr Nadir defended the minister's conduct, saying that his help had been 'much appreciated by me in my fight for justice'. Mr Mates yesterday sought to quell the growing political row by saying he had no idea that the former chairman of the collapsed Polly Peck empire was planning to jump bail. But Labour gave notice that it intended to pursue the matter. MPs believe that Mr Nadir sought help from a number of other politicians, including his constituency MP, Mr Peter Brooke, the National Heritage Secretary, but there is no suggestion that any apart from Mr Mates responded. Mr Mates, a minister in the Northern Ireland office and MP for East Hampshire, said in a statement yesterday that he had been advised it was proper for him to pursue matters raised by a constituent who was one of Mr Nadir's advisers, even after he became a minister last year. As for a watch that Mr Mates had given Mr Nadir after the businessman's own had been taken by solicitors for trustees in bankruptcy, Mr Mates said it was 'intended and accepted as a light-hearted gesture'. Mr Mates emphasised that he had not known of Mr Nadir's plan to break the terms of his bail and leave the UK for Cyprus, and added that it was an action of which he strongly disapproved. Explaining why he had acted as he did, Mr Mates said: 'Some months after I had been appointed to the government further matters were brought to my notice which seemed again to merit examination. 'Having obtained advice that it was still proper for me to do so, I again met the attorney-general. There followed further exchanges of correspondence, all of which took place well before Mr Nadir left the country.' Mr Nadir, speaking from Cyprus, said that Mr Mates had acted after being asked by one of his constituents to refer 'certain wrongdoings of the Serious Fraud Office and others to the attorney-general'. Mr Nadir said: 'I thank God that there are people in Britain who are prepared to see justice prevail, in particular Mr Michael Mates MP.' Mr Alistair Darling, Labour's City spokesman, insisted that Mr John Major should look into the minister's actions. He also questioned Mr Mates's judgment in giving Mr Nadir the watch. This view appeared to be endorsed by Mrs Betsy Wilson, Mr Mates's constituency chairman. She said: 'Perhaps with hindsight it was not very sensible. Obviously it has not done him, the party or his future much good.'</p>

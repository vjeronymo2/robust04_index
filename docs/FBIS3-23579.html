			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by NARODNA ARMIYA special correspondent </F> Lieutenant-Colonel Nykyfor Lysytsya: "Officers Have to Set an  Example"]    [Text] Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine  and First Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine  Lieutenant-General Anatoliy Lopata visited units of the 14th Air  Army during the end-of-training-period performance  evaluation.    A commission headed by Colonel-General Anatoliy Lopata, as  has already been reported, conducted a performance evaluation in  military units of the 14th Air Army. The head of the committee  visited several aviation garrisons, became familiarized with the  state of affairs, met with servicemen there and answered a host  of their questions.    The officers of army command were interested first and  foremost in what the structures of the Air Forces will be in the  future. It was indicated in reply that the amount of aviation on  the territory of Ukraine (and this conforms to international  treaties) is considerably less than is needed for three air  armies. There will thus certainly be no need to maintain three  army staffs in the future.    A new branch of the armed forces--the Air Defense Troops--is  also being created. The Air Forces and the Air-Defense Troops  will be part of them. This will cause changes in administrative  structures as well. But all of the reforms will take place after  diligent study, analysis and substantiation, and without any  haste whatsoever.    The problem of providing flight personnel for the  units--especially helicopter units--is a quite acute one in the  air army, since they are trained in Russia. How will this  problem be resolved?    We are not refusing any officers today, including pilots,  who  express the desire to move from Russia and serve in Ukraine,  stated Colonel-General Anatoliy Lopata in reply. And they are  coming to serve. But not as many as are needed. At the same  time, we are not keeping anyone here by force. All of those who  wish to do so can move to Russia. The fact that they do not want  very much to accept them there is another matter. We will solve  the problem of training pilots using our own resources. We have  already accepted into the Military Aviation Academy, this year,  enough cadets to train for all branches of aviation.  Difficulties are inevitable until they are trained. All pilots  who intend to continue their service must thus be given the  opportunity to do so.    The shortage of housing is probably problem number one for  all garrisons, including the air garrisons.    We had to build twenty-eight thousand apartments this year,  indicated the chief of the Main Staff. The corresponding funding  was allocated for it. The state was counting on the fact that  some military property would be sold abroad, and that most of  the funds received would be directed toward housing  construction. We were not able to build that quantity of  apartments in just a year, however, because all of those funds  were subject to inflation and were devalued considerably. We can  count on only half that amount. A program to provide servicemen  with housing in the future has already been worked out. It  envisages the receipt of funds from other sources. It is also  permissible to find and encourage investors on the following  terms: Anyone can build housing on the land of the military  department, including foreign structures, but only provided that  thirty percent of the apartments will belong to them, and the  rest to us.    There is another way out of the housing problem as  well--individual construction by servicemen. But there are still  no funds for that. The state has not even allocated funds to  grant the loans stipulated by the corresponding legislation. The  solution of the housing problem is thus made more difficult by  the lack of funds. Housing will appear in the future, when the  financing is arranged. The "first in line" people--those who are  being discharged--will be provided with apartments in the first  two years, and all the rest in five years. Those calculations  are based on the actual capabilities of our state.    The absence of funds is also complicating the payment for  municipal services by military units. How can this situation be  rectified?    Colonel-General Anatoliy Lopata replied that if there is  nothing with which to pay, then do not pay. There is good  precedent for this in Poltava Oblast. There the local  administration decided to cancel all of the indebtedness of the  military units for heat and electric power. A billion  karbovantsi were also allocated for interest-free loans to do  preparatory work to erect housing next year for servicemen. They  also allocated half a billion karbovantsi so as to pay the  officers and warrant officers in a timely manner, since the  financing was delayed at the center. All of this testifies to  the fact that the officials in Poltava understand very well that  without the support of the local authorities, it is too  difficult for our state to maintain the armed forces today. This  should also be understood in other oblasts as well, and they  should meet the servicemen halfway.    A question was also posed regarding to whom the helicopter  units will be subordinate. Colonel-General Anatoliy Lopata  answered that all of us in the "infantry" have a great deal of  respect for the fliers. We thus feel that army aviation should  be part of the ground forces and be part of the structures of  the districts, corps and divisions.    The helicopter units are subordinate to the air armies  today.  Why was that decision made? Only because that could provide for  at least a minimal level of training during these difficult  times for us.    The fliers also posed the question of improving the supply  of  military clothing, and especially special types.    It was indicated in reply that the President has already  approved new models for military dress. It is, to put it thus,  pretty good, no worse than in Russia. Its production is based  entirely on the industry of Ukraine. We will do everything to  see that the necessary quantity of dress, footwear and  everything else is manufactured, and we will supply it to the  troops in the necessary quantities.    We are issuing coveralls like those for tank crews to the  aircraft ground-support specialists today, so as to get out of  the current situation. We have ordered flight suits from Russia  for the pilots. There will be no problems with the supply of  mat&eacute;riel in the future.    Many pilots were uneasy about how they will preserve their  proficiency ratings, since in the absence of fuel they are not  meeting the norms for flying time.    We obtain all the fuel for aviation, it was stated in reply,  from Azerbaijan on a barter basis.    There is fuel in Ukraine as well, but funds are needed to  pay  for it. The financing for the Ministry of Defense, however, is  unsteady; funds are even lacking for timely pay, whence many  misfortunes. We hope things will be better in the coming year.  This year we have resorted to reducing the requirements for the  number of hours of flying time for all categories of flight  personnel, so as not to deprive them of their existing  proficiency ratings. We are approaching this problem in  considered fashion, and no pilot will be deprived of his rights  or privileges.    Colonel-General Anatoliy Lopata, in concluding the meeting,  transmitted the request of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine  that all officers make an example of themselves, and approach  the resolution of problems connected with the building of our  armed forces in considered fashion. All problems can be  resolved, he indicated, for which purpose we must forget about  discord; only unity can hold sway in officers' circles. We must  preserve our respect for each other, and at the same time raise  our mutual exactingness in the performance of official duties.</p>

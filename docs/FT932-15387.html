			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / World Trade News: Moscow 'needs own Marshall plan' - The ECE, a UN body, has put the stress on long-term aid ECONOMIC aid for Russia must address the country's underlying problems of monetary instability and structural change, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe says in its annual economic survey* published today. The ECE calls on the G7 nations, whose finance and foreign ministers will discuss aid to Russia as the main agenda item at their meeting in Tokyo today, to commit themselves to a long-term reform programme on the scale of the post-war Marshall plan that channelled billions of dollars of US aid into the economic reconstruction of western Europe. 'One of the worst outcomes would be . . . a list of short-term measures, hastily put together with a maximum of publicity,' the ECE says, warning against another 'false start' on the road to Russian reform. The ECE, which groups almost all the countries of western and eastern Europe, the US and Canada, also urges western governments not to neglect other eastern European countries in their concern for Russia. A broader, regional perspective of the transition to market-based economies is needed, the report says. The UN body has consistently argued that western aid for eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union has failed to grasp the long-term dimensions of economic reform, which requires transformation not simply of economic and institutional infrastructures but people's understanding of and ability to operate in a market economy. Western assistance has been inadequate, badly co-ordinated and poorly targeted, the report says. Too little attention has been paid to constructing coherent long-term transition plans and building a public consensus behind them, including provision of an effective welfare safety net. Bilateral and multilateral financing for eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union may have amounted to about Dollars 40bn last year, the ECE estimates. But only a small proportion of this money was grant aid or concessionary finance and little was directly focused on reform activities. About half was accounted for by debt rescheduling and other forms of 'special financing'. The total sum compares with net German government transfers of Dollars 96bn to its new eastern states in 1992, the report notes. Foreign direct investment too has proved disappointing. Net inflows rose from about Dollars 600m in 1990 to just under Dollars 3bn last year, but this compares with the Dollars 28bn or so flowing to developing countries and worldwide flows of some Dollars 200bn. In addition, 90 per cent is concentrated in Hungary and the Czech Republic. 'When debt servicing and other income payments are set in the balance against capital inflows, there was a net outflow of resources from most of the east European countries in 1992,' the report says. It also warns that protectionist pressures in Europe, such as recent EC restrictions on steel imports, threaten to snuff out glimmerings of economic recovery in Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary, which have been largely based on growth of exports to the west. Reviewing economic developments last year in eastern Europe (excluding the former Soviet Union), the ECE says output fell for the fourth year in succession, by 10 per cent, bringing the cumulative drop in GDP to more than 30 per cent. However, there were signs that the downturn was beginning to bottom out and in a few countries there were signs of recovery. In Poland, GDP rose slightly last year, and a further increase is expected in 1993. Hungary, too, may see some rise in output this year. But the ECE fears the rupture in trade relations between the new Czech and Slovak republics could stifle Czech growth prospects in 1993 and worsen the predicted drop in Slovak output. Elsewhere in eastern Europe, output is predicted to go on falling this year but by less than in 1992. In Russia, the Baltic states and other former Soviet republics 'the slump in output deepened through 1992'. The ECE is making no prognosis for 1993. Russian net material product (which excludes services) fell by 19 per cent last year. In the Baltic states, output fell by 28 to 44 per cent. Meanwhile, recorded unemployment in the transition economies rose rapidly in 1992, the Czech Republic being a notable exception, and the ECE expects another sharp increase this year as privatisation and bankruptcy laws bring redundancies in their wake. The report notes that private sector activity is growing strongly in eastern Europe, especially in agriculture, construction, trade and other services, but not by enough to cushion job losses in largely state-run industry. Inflation fell last year in Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland and the Baltic states but accelerated elsewhere. In Russia, the proportion of people officially classified as living below minimum subsistence levels more than doubled to 29 per cent over the year, as real incomes slumped.  ------------------------------------------------ INTERNATIONAL AID COMMITMENTS  ------------------------------------------------ To the countries of eastern Europe and the former USSR states* (Ecu m)  ------------------------------------------------ Donors/creditors                            Total  ------------------------------------------------ Community total                            73,459 EC member states: of which                 61,880   France                                    3,771   Germany                                  46,713   Italy                                     5,725  ------------------------------------------------ EC institutions: of which                  11,579   EC                                        8,009   EIB                                       3,370  ------------------------------------------------ Efta: of which                              4,904   Austria                                   2,267  ------------------------------------------------ Other G24 countries: of which              20,550   Canada                                    3,102   Japan                                     4,509   United States                             1,252  ------------------------------------------------ G24: total above                           98,913   Total bilateral                         104,457   Total multilateral                       14,327   Grand total                             118,785  ------------------------------------------------ * New eastern Europe commitments are cumulative from beginning of Q1 1990 to end of Q2 1992; for the ex-USSR from Q1 1990 to November 1992  ------------------------------------------------ Source: ECE  ------------------------------------------------ *Economic Survey of Europe in 1992-1993, United Nations, New York.

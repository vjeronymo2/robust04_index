			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed "Seismometer" column: "Shinseito Unity in </F> Crisis--Members Voice Frustration With Ozawa"]    [Text] Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] is often called an  "army" because of its strong unity since the time it was the  Takeshita faction in the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP].  However, its unity now faces a challenge.    As Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata is Shinseito's "trump card,"  according to the group's secretary general Ichiro Ozawa, the  Shinseito-led coalition was behind the formation of a joint  floor group called "Kaishin" [Innovation] aimed at strengthening  the Hata administration. The attempt, though, triggered the  withdrawal of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] from  the coalition, and the Hata administration has become the  weakest government in the last 39 years. This turn of events  prompted Shinseito members to express their frustration with  Ozawa's political manners. While Ozawa still takes a bullish  attitude, the "tremor" in the Shinseito is unlikely to be calmed  easily.  <H5>  Ozawa Urges Shinseito Unity </H5>   "Unexpectedly, we are forced to run a minority government.  In such circumstances, we must further strengthen our unity,"  Ozawa declared at the beginning of the 10 May meeting of  Shinseito secretaries. The next day, Acting Secretary General  Kozo Watanabe spoke to party members perplexed at recent  developments on the political scene: "Our participation in  Kaishin was determined through due process, as it was approved  by the party secretariat."    The party executives responded quickly to questions from  rank-and-file members because many younger lawmakers were very  irritated with senior officials who, they felt, had not told the  truth about the formation of "Kaishin." Even middle-ranking  members in charge of interparty negotiations have shown their  frustration with Ozawa's "arbitrary decisions."    Former Economic Planning Agency head Hajime Aino openly  criticized Ozawa at the 6 May press conference in Saga City,  saying, "Mr. Ozawa has too much power."  <H5>  Friction Among Senior Officials </H5>   On 9 May, Aino called on Ozawa at his office in the Diet to  apologize for and withdraw his remark in Saga City.  Nevertheless, Ozawa reportedly exploded at Aino, instead of  forgiving him.    Since the coalition has lost its majority in the lower  house,  the opposition is urging an early reshuffle of the lower house  standing committee chairmen. Shinseito's Eiji Okuda, who is  chairman of the lower house Committee on Rules and  Administration, called for consultations with the opposition,  saying, "As the minority government, the coalition will have to  accept almost all demands from opposition parties, or they will  open all-out war against us." However, Ozawa and other coalition  leaders adopted a policy of "filling the vacant seats according  to the coalition's interests."    Okuda made his debut as a lower house member in the 1969  general election. Prime Minister Hata and Ozawa are also from  the "class of '69," and Okuda is now a top Shinseito leader,  ranked alongside Acting Secretary General Watanabe. A senior  party official, though, said, "Mr. Ozawa has been showing strong  displeasure with Mr. Okuda since the inauguration of the  Hosokawa administration because Mr. Okuda listens positively to  the opinions of the opposition."    The official said relations between the two leaders became  even worse after that, and now: "Mr. Ozawa never meets Mr.  Okuda in person, even in the Diet." The class of '69 met on the  evening of 9 May to reconfirm the unity of Shinseito's leaders'  backing for Prime Minister Hata, but Ozawa did not show up.    The "monolithic" unity of Shinseito has been shaken, but the  controversy over "Kaishin" is not the only reason for its  critical condition. No-confidence motions against the Hata  cabinet could be adopted whenever they are submitted, and the  coalition always faces the possibility of a general election  followed by a dissolution of the lower house.    As a younger Shinseito member noted: In such circumstances,  the party "cannot rely on Mr. Ozawa's charisma alone."    Some senior members are calling for a complete revision of  party strategy, noting that "Shinseito would be better off  seeking ties with the majority group in the LDP if Mr. Ozawa is  really serious about policy-oriented reorganization of politics."    Another senior official said "Shinseito has to adhere to an  anti-LDP stance only because of his personal feelings."    Members, therefore, are losing confidence in the party's  political stance.    Ozawa Still Shows Bullish Attitude    "Anti-Ozawa opinions" have come to the surface at the local  level, too. Representatives of the Shinseito Nara Prefecture  branch called at the party headquarters on 12 May, and handed  over a written opinion directed to Prime Minister Hata and  Secretary General Ozawa. The representatives called for more  democratic decision-making procedures in Shinseito.    The representatives said: "It is hard for us to see the  party's decision-making process. We believe this is a good  opportunity to establish bottom-to-top communication in the  party." In response, Acting Secretary General Watanabe politely  said "we have no excuses."    The party executives said "no other local organization would  take such action," but they are troubled by the protest.    Even in such circumstances, Ozawa still shows a bullish  attitude. Following the inauguration of the Hata cabinet, Acting  Secretary General Watanabe and Secretary Hajime Funada called at  Ozawa's office to receive instructions on how to manage future  political schemes. Ozawa reportedly told them he was confident  he could break the LDP from the SDPJ because "the LDP will  certainly become more arrogant."    In a press conference on the evening of 10 May, he declared  the inauguration of the minority government is "a good chance to  clarify our own policies."    Ozawa's political manner is often called the "logic of the  majority and power." What will be the result of breaking the  political deadlock now that Ozawa has lost the "majority" that  was his ultimate weapon?    Shinseito executives plan to meet younger members at the  party headquarters on 16 May to try to cool their criticism.  Yet, Ozawa is still the key person when it comes to forecasting  the direction of Shinseito.</p>

UNUM did not disclose a sale price, but the NEL business - together with 18 per cent of NEL Permanent Health Insurance - was acquired by the US company for Pounds 38.9m (Dollars 70m) in July 1990 from Invesco MIM. UNUM then bought out the remaining 82 per cent of NEL Permanent Health Insurance for about Dollars 52m. In September 1990, UNUM made clear it planned to divest the life and pension operations, retaining the NEL PHI subsidiary.</p>

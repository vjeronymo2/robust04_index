			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Michelin bounces back into profit Michelin, the world's largest tyre manufacturer, bounced back into the black in the first half of 1994, reporting a net profit of FFr410m (Pounds 49m) after minority interests compared with a loss of FFr3.19bn last time. The result reflected a recovery in the European car market after the sharp recession of 1993 and the effects of the French group's restructuring programme, Mr Eric Bourdais de Charbonniere, finance director, said. Michelin's rationalisation plan launched in 1993 aims to cut costs by FFr3.5bn by the middle of next year. The workforce has been cut to about 120,000 from 129,000 at the beginning of 1993. Salary costs have fallen from 43.5 per cent of sales to 39.7 per cent. 'The results show we are on the right course', Mr Bourdais de Charbonniere said. 'But they mark only the beginning of the re-establishment of the financial situation'. It had taken FFr310m of provisions to cover further staffing changes in France. He cited continued growth in the US market and recovery in Europe as the factors behind a rise in sales from FFr30.6bn to FFr33.27bn. In both markets, however, the benefit to profits was restrained by the relative strength of sales of original equipment tyres, which are sold directly to manufacturers, as opposed to higher margin replacement tyres which are sold to individuals. In the US, the company expects the combined operations of Michelin and Uniroyal Goodrich, acquired in 1990, to break even this year. After tough negotiations with the United Rubber Workers union, Michelin said it had implemented more efficient shifts. Volume growth of 13 per cent in Europe, which increased market share, partly reflected market new commercial strategy of offering a more diversified tyre range. Michelin has also seen strong demand for 'green' tyres, which reduce fuel consumption by lowering resistance with the road. Michelin described the tyres as the most important technological innovation since its development of the radial tyre. It aims to produce about 14m green tyres this year. A FFr2.5bn exceptional charge relating to restructuring was the principal factor in the large loss in the first half last year. But even stripping out exceptional charges, Michelin achieved a net profit of FFr732m against a loss of FFr827m in the 1993 half of 1993. Lex, Page 22</p>

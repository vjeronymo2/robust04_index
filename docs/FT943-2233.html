			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Legal process on trial: The Strasbourg Commission's view that Ernest Saunders was denied a fair hearing The European Commission on Human Rights may have blown a large hole in the British government's campaign against white-collar crime. It has decided that Mr Ernest Saunders, the former Guinness chairman jailed for theft and false accounting after the company's 1986 takeover of Distillers, was denied a fair trial. In particular it concluded that the use by the prosecution at his trial in 1989 of answers given by Mr Saunders under compulsion to Department of Trade and Industry inspectors breached the European Convention on Human Rights. The ruling appears to be a serious blow to the Serious Fraud Office, for which the Guinness trial was a rare high-profile success. It may have a crucial bearing on the ability of the UK authorities to prosecute fraudsters and other financial miscreants, which depends to a significant extent on being able to compel suspects to answer questions. More tentatively, it may also have implications for the government's current strategy for combating other forms of crime by curbing the suspect's right to silence. The ruling is not binding and the issue will have to be decided by the full European Court of Human Rights. That could take two years. But if the Court upholds the Commissioners' findings, criminal law experts believe the result would have grave implications for the fight against fraud. This is because the authorities might no longer be able to use the transcripts of interviews with suspects carried out by Department of Trade and Industry inspectors as direct evidence in court. In the view of many experts, such interviews often play a crucial part in the prosecution case; without them, white-collar crimes can be extraordinarily difficult to prove. Mr John Clitheroe, a fraud lawyer and senior partner of London solicitors Kingsley Napley, says: 'DTI transcripts were used almost as the sole basis of the prosecution case in the Barlow Clowes trial. In many instances it's going to be the main plank of their case.' Mr Clitheroe believes that if the court upholds the commission's verdict the government would have to think again about the use of evidence provided by witnesses who have been compelled to answer questions by DTI inspectors. The same may go for such evidence when it is obtained by company liquidators under sections 235 and 236 of the Insolvency Act. Until recently it was thought evidence gathered by liquidators using their Insolvency Act powers could not be used directly in evidence at trial. But in July the House of Lords ruled in the case of Mr Muhammed Naviede, former chairman of Arrows trading company, that section 235 and 236 information can be used by the prosecution at trial. A Strasbourg court decision to uphold the commission may call this in question, too. The SFO is making no comment about the commission's ruling. But sources close to the office believe victory for Mr Saunders would not seriously damage the fight against fraud. They say the SFO is no longer so reliant on DTI inspectors' transcripts as it was at the time of the Guinness case. Nowadays it prefers to mount its own investigation using its powers under section 2 of the 1987 Criminal Justice Act to compel witnesses to answer its own questions. The SFO also believes that these draconian powers would not be affected by the commission's ruling. The commission's complaint with Mr Saunders's treatment is that he was compelled to answer questions and that his answers were then used in evidence against him. Information gathered by the SFO using its section 2 powers cannot be used as evidence in court unless the defendant deviates from the account he gave to the SFO. At worst, the SFO believes it might now have to consider carefully what reliance it wanted to place on DTI transcripts in future cases. What of the government's current attempt to curb the wider right to silence in ordinary criminal cases? Could that, too, be impaired? Mr David Kirk, a partner of solicitors Simons Muirhead Burton, believes the Strasbourg court would need to go much further than the commission for the government's new policy to be threatened. 'The new curb only goes as far as saying you can still say nothing, but if you do say nothing the judge can comment on your silence. That's not the same as compelling someone to answer and then using their answers against them in court.' But Mr Anthony Scrivener, QC, former chairman of the Bar Council, says that irrespective of what happens to Mr Saunders's case in Strasbourg, the government's curb on the right to silence cannot stand up: 'The first time someone is convicted without the benefit of the right to silence, the European Court of Human Rights will recommend the conviction is overturned. 'Most European countries uphold the right to silence. Mr Howard is trying to take us back to the dark ages. He should treat the Commission's decision as a shock warning of what's to come, and think again.' If Mr Scrivener is right, and the Strasbourg court does eventually strike down curbs on the wider right to silence, the government will be facing a rethink not just on its campaign to clean up the City.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 14 KYODO -- Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman  of the Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren), called  Tuesday [14 Jun] on Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata for his  cabinet's leadership in implementing deregulation and other  administrative reform, officials said.    "The cabinet should break the wall of vested interests and  lead administrative reforms decisively," Toyoda told Hata in a  meeting at the prime minister's official residence.    Toyoda and Keidanren's Vice Chairman Isao Nakauchi asked  Hata  to set a target to halve the number of economic regulations in  five years.    He also called on Hata to map out a plan for scrapping and  privatizing government-backed corporations.    Hata responded that the reforms and deregulations are a  national problem which must be tackled.    At the day's cabinet meeting, Hata instructed ministers to  display leadership in their ministries and agencies in compiling  deregulation measures by the end of the month.</p>

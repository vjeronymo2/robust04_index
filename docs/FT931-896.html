			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / The dangers of drift: G7 attitudes to the Russian crisis Most leading industrial countries are clear that they want Mr Boris Yeltsin to remain in control of the reins of power. What is less evident to them, however, is what he will do with them. There is now relative confidence that Mr Yeltsin will stay on. The doubts centre on whether his struggles with parliament will leave him capable of executing reforms. As one British official put it yesterday: 'The danger is more of drift than of civil war . . . It looks as if he will survive. But he needs to survive in an effective form to do something.' Germany yesterday signalled relief that Mr Yeltsin appeared to be gaining ground. Bonn officials see the alternative group supporting Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, as incoherent and irresponsible. They also believe that Mr Alexander Rutskoi, the vice-president, has lost support, and lacks the popular base to be an alternative president. German officials say the Group of Seven countries is moving towards a three-part plan to aid Moscow - the first element of which would be to speed up releasing all the cash in the Dollars 24bn package agreed last summer. 'That silly question of supporting Yeltsin or democracy does not exist,' one Bonn official said yesterday. 'The government programme is going in the right direction. Yeltsin has a strong team. These people do have a coherent programme. They are driving towards a market economy and more democracy.' In Washington, a fierce public debate has centred on one question. Is President Bill Clinton staking too much on the survival of Mr Yeltsin, just as Mr George Bush put too much faith in Mr Mikhail Gorbachev? Mr Clinton says the US supports Mr Yeltsin because he is 'the first elected Russian president in 1,000 years', and because economic and political reform, however halting, has been launched under his leadership. But the US adds that its investment is in the reform process ('with or without Yeltsin' as Mr Clinton put it) because, without reform, there will be no post-cold war peace dividend at home. The administration knows the US cannot, of its own accord, keep Mr Yeltsin in power. But the White House recognises that if he is toppled, it will get some of the blame, much as 'Who lost China?' and 'Who lost Iran?' were dominant questions 40 and 14 years ago. In Paris, the foreign ministry believes Mr Yeltsin has enough popular support to win his referendum and face down the Congress. But, like the US, France is emphasising its backing for democracy and economic reform, rather than solely for the Russian president. Mr Roland Dumas, the outgoing foreign minister, has been trying to hang on to his parliamentary seat ahead of tomorrow's second round of French legilsative elections. But he expressed confidence on Wednesday that Mr Yeltsin was still in control, and that the army would not intervene. On the question of new western aid, French officials believe the west should return to the ambitious plan worked out by ex-Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar. Stabilisation of the rouble should be left to the IMF which, they admit, has so far had little success in imposing monetary discipline on the Russian central bank - more under the influence of Congress than that of Mr Yeltsin. The G7 member showing most indifference to Mr Yeltsin's fate is Japan. Rather than being seen as the saviour of Russian democracy, Mr Yeltsin has earned distrust for his perceived belligerence over the Kurile Islands, occupied by the Soviet army in 1945. Mr Yeltsin was once called a 'liar' by Mr Michio Watanabe, the foreign minister, for his allegedly inconsistent statements on the Kuriles. There would be few tears in Tokyo if the Russian president, after his high-wire balancing act, came a cropper after all.

			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Observer: PUS appeal While Westminster ponders Maastricht, the Foreign Office is abuzz with the pithier little matter of who moves into the permanent undersecretary of state's gracious seat next August. Sir David Gillmore, whose rather unusual path to the top of the diplomatic service included three years at Reuters as well as a spell teaching for the Inner London Education Authority in the late 1960s, has been in place since 1991. A highly popular but unflashy PUS, he briefly leapt to the limelight last September administering the very public wigging of the former German ambassador amid the ERM turmoil. Gillmore doesn't turn 60 until August 1994, but the FCO hates to be rushed and four names are already in the air. Sir Robin Renwick, 55, the British ambassador credited with restoring relations after the saga of Clinton's passport during the presidential election, has been mentioned, as has Sir John Kerr, 51, permanent representative to the EC in Brussels. Sir Nigel Broomfield, 56, ambassador in Bonn, has the advantage of knowing Gillmore from Moscow in the early 1970s. And there is Sir John Weston, 55, the UK permanent representative to Nato. Meanwhile Sir David Hannay, the all-star permanent representative to the UN, is not thought a likely contender. The FCO is certainly keen to reward him for his time in New York but, at 58, he may be a shade too old. The current betting is on Weston. Renwick will be left where he shines, in the field; and Kerr, who has done his best in the uphill task of keeping Britain at the heart of Europe for three years, is young enough to have another crack at the best job in Whitehall.</p>

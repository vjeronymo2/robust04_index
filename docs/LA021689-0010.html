			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEDICATE THE '90S TO THE ENVIRONMENT;  </P> <P> INTERNATIONAL COMMITMENT COULD BE OUR GIFT TO NEW CENTURY  </P> <P> Today's environmental problems are closely interlinked, planetary in scale and  deadly serious. They cannot be addressed issue-by-issue or by one nation or  even by a small group of nations acting alone. They will not yield to modest  commitments of resources in the face of a doubling of world population and a  quintupling of world economic activity in the lifetimes of today's children.  </P> <P> The nations of the world must come together in recognition of that grave  challenge. They should declare that a priority mission of international  cooperation and diplomacy in the 1990s will be to deliver a gift to the new  century of a planet sustained and whole. To give long-term structure to this  commitment they should establish a 10-year program, the International  Environmental Decade.  </P> <P> This program could be inaugurated with the high-level international conference  on the environment promised by President Bush during the campaign -- a pledge  that he has since reiterated. Born in politics, this conference in fact  presents an opportunity to do something of genuine historical importance.  </P> <P> The timing could not be more propitious. The world's environment is in trouble.  The buildup of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere threatens  far-reaching climate change, and one class of these gases --  chlorofluorocarbons -- is also depleting the Earth's ozone layer, which shields  us from the sun's ultraviolet radiation. Over large areas of the globe, air  pollutants are escaping urban-industrial areas and invading the countryside,  seriously damaging aquatic life, forests and crops.  </P> <P> In the developing world, pressures on natural resources intensify daily. The  deserts expand while the forests, with their immense wealth of life forms,  retreat. An acre of tropical forests disappears every second. Hundreds of  millions of people live in absolute poverty, destroying the resources on which  their future depends because no alternative is open to them.  </P> <P> Although the seriousness of these challenges is increasingly acknowledged by  political leaders as diverse as Margaret Thatcher, Mikhail Gorbachev and Rajiv  Gandhi, only modest efforts have been launched to deal with them. As yet there  is no concerted international response on a scale equal to the challenges. The  international conference on the environment would be a major step in closing  the gap between the increasing realization that grave problems exist and the  paucity of the political response to date.  </P> <P> An International Environmental Decade could both stimulate and coordinate  action on three fronts. The first of these is providing the poor of the world  with environmentally non-destructive livelihoods; sustainable development is  critical both to meet basic human needs and to take pressure off a  deteriorating resource base. The second front is transforming industrial  systems away from the pollution-prone technologies of the 20th Century to the  environmentally benign technologies that will be essential if economic growth  is to continue. And the third is stabilizing populations both in nations where  growth is explosive and on a global basis before the world's population doubles  again.  </P> <P> Most basically, world political leaders must devise a new system of  international responsibility -- burden-sharing to sustain the Earth and its  people -- that does not exist today. Unless such a system is worked out, the  next great international crisis is likely to be about the environment.  </P> <P> Nowhere is such a system needed more than in slowing down the global warming  brought on by the greenhouse effect. To be successful, we will need a series of  international conventions that not only respond to the complexity of that issue  but also provide complementary solutions to other environmental problems.  </P> <P> We need to secure swift international approval of the ozone-layer protection  protocol signed in Montreal last year and have the nations of the world come  back to negotiate a complete, swift phase-out of chlorofluorocarbons. We need  an overall global climate-protection convention -- a prime goal of which should  be to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions through greatly improved energy  efficiency and other measures.  </P> <P> We need an international agreement to protect the world's tropical forests and  to reforest the spreading wasteland areas in many developing countries. Relief  for Third World countries from the stifling burden of international debt will  be required for progress on this front.  </P> <P> Bush's sponsorship of an environmental conference of world leaders can put the  world on the road to this new system of international responsibility. The 1990s  are all the time that we have left to prepare what can be our most important  gift to the new century.  </P></p>

			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Polish copper strike suspended POLISH COPPER workers yesterday agreed to suspend a month-long strike at the KGHM Polska Miedz combine without obtaining the pay increases they had demanded, reports Reuter from Warsaw. Mr Jerzy Pietraszek, a company official, estimated that the strike had caused the loss of 25,000 tonnes of electrolytic copper from the planned yearly production of 320,000 tonnes and cost the company Dollars 70m. KGMH is Poland's only copper producer and exports about 70 per cent of its output. The strikers were offered one-off payments equivalent to between Dollars 100 to Dollars 130 a head. They had demanded wage rises of up to 30 per cent but Mr Pietraszek said any award would be much lower. The strike, which started on July 20, prompted six trade unions to call for nation-wide action in support of the KGHM workers. They also demanded an end to Poland's economic reforms. Seven collieries were hit by strike action and railway workers caused the cancellation of about a quarter of all passenger train services in Silesia, southern Poland. Prime minister Hanna Suchocka said yesterday that the government was not prepared to meet the unions' demands, adding: 'The government is going to be firm. It cannot run around the country at every request of the unions'. China's copper demand in 1992 will rise to a record 810,000 tonnes from 650,000 tonnes last year because of a boom in the construction sector, Nissho Iwai Corporation, a big Japanese trade house estimates. The country's copper output is likely to be 590,000 tonnes in 1992, up from 570,000 in 1991, Nissho Iwai believes. 'To cover the supply shortage, China will have to buy nearly 210,000 tonnes of copper throughout this year in the spot market and through bilateral deals,' a Nissho Iwai official said yesterday. It had contracted to buy 170,000 tonnes of copper as of the end of August, he added.</p>

			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Survey of West Norfolk (2): Financial service groups targeted - Manufacturing and agriculture are leading regional employers AGRICULTURE still accounts for seven per cent of total employment in West Norkfolk, compared with a national average of two per cent. There are also between 3,000 and 4,000 jobs in tourism. But manufacturing is the main employment sector accounting for more than 40 per cent of jobs, although the largest single private sector employer - on a year-round basis - is Foster Refrigerator, which employs employs 650 people. Some of the food processing companies have seasonal workers - thus Frigoscandia, for example, employs between 730 and 438 at various times of the year. It has been established there for 26 years. The manufacturing economy of West Norfolk today is shaped to a great extent by the influx of companies in the l950s and l960s. They were attracted either by government grants or the availability of quality raw materials - namely vegetables and other agricultural products. Amongst the larger companies there is an emphasis on food processing, refrigeration and engineering. As in many rural areas, there are number of small but specialised manufacturing concerns in sectors such furniture making, crystal glass-blowing and in printing, stationery and artists' materials supplies. In the main sector of manufacturing and food processing, some of the well-known names include Campbell's Soups, Master Foods, Plumrose, Del Monte, British Sugar and Frigoscandia. Many of them established factories in the area in the l960s. According to Mr Nigel Payne,the manufacturing and logistics director of Campbell's Soups, the location of King's Lynn was chosen in the early 1960s - not only because government assistance was offered but because of the plentiful supply of good quality produce such as tomatoes, mushrooms and other vegetables. Mr Charles Abbs, Frigoscandia's general manager, says: 'We are a frozen food processor, packer and storer. We pack around 75,000 tonnes a year - of that, around 25,000 tonnes are either peas or potatoes in some form.' The company, originally a cold storer, sees itself as service-provider - 'we don't actually make anything - we package for 'own-label' customers, such as Tesco and Safeway.' But Foster Refrigator (UK), although sometimes identified with the food-processing sector, is a leading manufacturer of refrigeration equipment for the commercial, retail and hotel sectors. It arrived in King's Lynn in l965. Some larger companies were located in the region before government assistance was available. For example, Dow Chemicals has been in King's Lynn since the mid-l950s. Mr Ed de Graaf, the UK manufacturing manager of Dow, says that the company set up in the area because of its agricultural emphasis and the subsequent market for insecticides. Cooper Roller Bearings, which employs 330 in King's Lynn, and describes itself as a manufacturer of split cylindrical bearings, has been in the area since the late nineteenth century. It grew out of a company formed by an inventor called Thomas Cooper who built, sold or rented steam tractors for agriculture. Porvair, one of the area's high technology companies, has established an international reputation in microporous technology was originally part of the Choride group with facilities in the area. Sun Electric UK, which employs 250 people in King's Lynn is another high technology company. It is a subsidiary of Sun Electric Corporation, a world leader in the supply of vehicle diagnostic, exhaust emission-testing and wheel service equipment to automotive industries. The company originally set up a facility in West Norfolk in l967 to service clients in what was then the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) trading region of Scandanavia, but not because there were government grants available. While companies have found that while the old problem (now about to be eased) of poor communications has added to transport costs, this difficulty was more than offset by the relative cheapness of land and property and by the right labour availability. Mr Ed de Graaf comments: 'King's Lynn is a relatively low-cost area and we are successful here. We have no thought of moving.' There has, however, been one conspicuous casualty of the recession: Anglia Canners was taken over and closed down with the loss of more than 250 jobs. But most companies have grown and expanded. Sun Electric, for example, has invested more than Pounds 1m in recent few years and expanded its factory space from 55,000 sq feet to 67,000 sq feet. Campbell's Soups has increased output in volume terms by 40 per cent in the past 10 years, although with a reduced workforce. Mr Abbs at Frigoscandia says: 'We have increased our output each year for the past 10 years, even though there is a static market for frozen vegetables.' Although the manufacturing sector in the region is generally in good health, the area has not attracted larger companies for some time. Given that food processing is a 'mature' industry, with companies vying for bigger shares of a stable markets, and given that communications to the region are about to improve, the local authorities are keen to attract new investment to West Norkfolk, particularly in the financial services and high technology fields.</p>

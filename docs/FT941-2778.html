			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Poland (9): Lame ducks are the target - Foreign Banks Most foreign banks were waiting for the outcome of Poland's negotiations with the London Club creditors before deciding whether to open an operation in the country. But if they do take the plunge they will probably find that getting a banking licence will not be easy. The NBP, the central bank, has imposed a de facto moratorium on new banks as it struggles to repair an ailing private banking sector which expanded too fast in 1990 and 1991 and is now knee-deep in bad loans. Ms Gronkiewicz Waltz, the NBP chairman, says she is happy to see foreign banks coming, but only if they consider taking one of the sector's lame ducks under their wing. That also applies to local investors keen to set up a new bank, she adds. This leaves a handful of banks including Credit Lyonnais, Westdeutsche Landesbank and Banque Nationale de Paris, working together with the Dresdner Bank, waiting in a queue and browsing through the NBP's 'transfer list' of around 15 small private banks in serious trouble. But 10 banks with a majority foreign shareholding, who obtained their licences in 1990 and 1991, are already in place. One, the American Bank in Poland, in which Banker's Trust has a 17 per cent stake, is preparing a stock exchange flotation. This would allow foreign shareholders, such as Time Warner and Morrison Knudsen, the US building company, to exit profitably. Other banks include ING, which bought 25.9 per cent of Bank Slaski, and two Austrian banks active throughout central Europe, Creditanstalt and Raiffeisen, and Citibank. Citibank is probably the most profitable of the foreign banks. It concentrates on providing foreign trade and cash management services for big foreign investors such as International Paper and McDonald's and has also attracted local customers with the range of electronic banking services on offer. The wholly-owned subsidiary, opened in November 1991 by Mr William Rhodes, Citibank's deputy-chairman, last year reported a 415bn zloty (Dollars 18.5m) net profit on the US bank's initial investment of Dollars 10m, backed subsequently by a Dollars 7.5m subordinated loan from its parent company. The bank intends to raise its capital to around 900bn zlotys after retaining the net profit of 131.5bn zlotys in 1992 and last year's net profit, together with the subordinated loan. But last year the bank's profit tax break, equal to the sum of the initial capital, expired. Its new capital base will be twice as large as Citibank's Hungarian subsidiary, which is capitalised at Dollars 20m and reported a Dollars 14m profit in 1992. Citibank's locally-recruited 120-strong staff are young. For one in three it is their first job. 'We have brought in grey hairs from outside the country' says Mr Allan Hirst, the local Texas-bred chief executive. The branch spends Dollars 400,000 on training annually. Mr Hirst is sensitive to criticism that foreign banks constitutes a competitive threat to local banks. 'All the new Polish clients with whom we are doing business have also stayed with their old banks,' he says. From Citibank's point of view it is Polish banks such as Bank Handlowy and the new Export Development Bank (BRE) which are keeping up the competition on interest rates and services. That said, however, Citibank Poland's gross profit of 541.7bn zlotys last year is high compared to local private banks such as BRE which reported a gross profit of 357.9bn zlotys on a balance sheet double Citbank's 5,010bn zlotys. This year's capital increase will give Citibank a chance to expand its lending as Polish banking laws restrict individual loans to 10 per cent of a bank's capital. But Mr Hirst also intends to maintain his bank's competitive edge by building up its technological capacity to manage corporate finance and foreign exchange transactions. 'In 10 years' time we want to be the provider of the highest quality banking products and services bar none,' he says.</p>

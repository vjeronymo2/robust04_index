			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Costa Rica set to move on hostages COSTA RICAN police were poised yesterday to end a hostage crisis by force if a kidnap gang refused to hand over 18 Supreme Court justices and five others held for two days, a senior police chief said, Reuter reports from San Jose. Dozens of Costa Rican police with M-16 assault rifles have sealed off access to the Supreme Court, where four gunmen took the hostages after breaking in through the basement on Monday. The gang, which calls itself the Death Command, lowered its ransom demand on Tuesday from Dollars 20m to Dollars 8m but said it would blow up the Supreme Court building if its demands were not met. They have also demanded safe passage to a South American country. The Costa Rican government has been strongly criticised for its moderate approach to resolving two recent hostage crises. Police sources said its position had hardened since late on Tuesday, when it ruled out earlier fears that Colombian drug traffickers were behind this week's kidnapping.</p>

			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Tory MP failed to declare interest A Conservative MP last night expressed 'regret' that he had failed to record in the Commons register of members' interest his relationship with a consultancy company which had employed Mr Neil Hamilton, the trade and industry minister. Mr Michael Colvin, the MP for Romsey and Waterside, said last night that he had worked for a brief period for Strategy Network International. He took up the post after Mr Hamilton, at the centre of a separate political row over so-called 'cash for questions' allegations, joined the government in mid-1990 and severed his connections with the consultancy. Mr Colvin told the Financial Times that he had a 'trial run' with the consultancy in 1991 but added: 'The relationship with the company did not last.' The company represented a number of South African companies. Mr Colvin had a long-standing interest in the country since he first visited it in the 1950s and opposed the imposition of trade sanctions against the then apartheid regime. He said last night that his entry in the members' register for the year at issue had been extremely detailed, including, for example, a free day's fishing, courtesy of an industrial company. Asked why the relationship had not been mentioned, Mr Colvin said: 'I am a very assiduous declarer. The fact that SNI was not mentioned in that year was an oversight that I regret.' Mr Colvin declined, however, to comment on the size of the payment he received, stressing that it was an 'absolute point of principle' that MPs were not obliged to disclose such details.</p>

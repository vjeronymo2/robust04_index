			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Opec questions global warming An Opec official questioned the phenomenon of global warming yesterday and said a proposed EC carbon tax to combat it was a ploy to control world energy markets, Reuter reports from Cairo. 'We do not know whether global warming is a certainty or not,' Mr Mohammed al-Sahlawi, head of OPEC's news agency, told a symposium of economists. 'Is there really a man-made problem, or is it part of a natural cycle?' Brussels plans to introduce a tax of Dollars 1 per barrel of oil in 1993 to fight global warming and curb demand for oil. The tax would rise to Dollars 10 a barrel by the year 2000.</p>

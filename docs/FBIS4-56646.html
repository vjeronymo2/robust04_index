			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vicente Briceno from Miraflores Palace for the </F> "Union Radio News" newscast -- live]    [Text] The situation recently provoked by the abrupt  increase in the dollar's price, from 118 to 127 bolivares,  prompted a meeting between President Rafael Caldera; Jose Bouza  Izquierdo, chairman of the National Banking Council; and Berend  Roosen, commissioner for financial reforms; as well as Andres  Caldera, minister of the Presidency Secretariat, and Ciro Anez  Fonseca, minister of agriculture and livestock.    The well-known banker attributed Friday's decrease in the  rhythm of the devaluation, from 5 percent to 2.5 percent, to  actions that were coordinated by the Central Bank of Venezuela  and private banks. This has managed to positively control the  dollar's exchange rate which has prevailed since last week.    [Begin Bouza Izquierdo recording] Nothing new or different  is  happening. The government has just ratified one more time that a  foreign exchange control or a maxi-devaluation are not part of  our current plans. I believe this is enough to believe we do not  have to rush out and buy foreign currency with anguish, under  pressure, or with nervousness. In fact, this only pushes the  price upward and people who go to the parallel market will pay  amounts that far exceed the foreign currency's real value. The  banks are within the limitations that are characteristic of the  operations we carry out, supplying the foreign currency that the  Central Bank of Venezuela passes on to us. Our actions are  within an absolutely regular scheme. I do not think we should  feel concerned or nervous. That will only worsen the situation.  [end recording]</p>

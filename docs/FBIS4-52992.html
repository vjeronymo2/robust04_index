			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 13 (KCNA) -- Korean residents in  Russia published statements denouncing the South Korean  authorities' scheme to drag compatriots in Sakhalin, Russia,  into South Korea through conspiracy and tieup with the Japanese  Government.    The chief of the Organization of Korean Nationals in  Sakhalin, Chae Chong-man, said Koreans' immigration into  Sakhalin from their dear homeland was caused by the Japanese  imperialists' criminal act of aggression in the past, so it is a  political issue under any circumstances, not a pure  "humanitarian" issue as the South Korean puppet authorities  allege, nor a matter to be settled with some money.    "The South Korean puppet authorities' scheme to forcibly  take  compatriots in Sakhalin to South Korea is aimed at fomenting  discord and consciousness of confrontation within the Korean  nation and perpetuating the division of the country," he  contended.    The chairman of the Sakhalin Regional Committee of Koreans  for Support to Peaceful Reunification, Kwon Chon-sik, warned  that if the South Korean authorities persist in their plot to  drag away compatriots through tieup with the Japanese  authorities, they would be held entirely responsible for the  consequences arising therefrom.    The chief of the Organization of Korean Nationals in Russia,  Choe Yong-su, said Korean residents in Russia would make every  possible effort for a peaceful reunification of the country and  national unity and fight against the South Korean authorities'  anti-popular policy and for peace on the Korean peninsula.</p>

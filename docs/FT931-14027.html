			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Senators likely to confirm Baird ANY SERIOUS threat to the nomination of Ms Zoe Baird as attorney general in the Clinton administration was much diminished yesterday when the senior Republican on the Senate judiciary committee stated flatly that she should be confirmed in office. Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah said controversy about her hiring of illegal aliens, a Peruvian couple, for child care and housekeeping work, for which she has paid back taxes and a civil penalty, in no way disqualified her from the position. In a statement after her prepared testimony, Ms Baird, who, at 40, would be the first US woman attorney general, told the committee she had been wrong to hire the couple. Ms Baird was formally presented to the committee by her two home state Democratic senators from Connecticut, Mr Christopher Dodd and Mr Joseph Lieberman, and by the new senator from Washington, Ms Patty Murray. Mr Lloyd Cutler, one of Washington's great power brokers and - along with Mr Christopher, for whose law firm she once worked - a chief sponsor, sat just behind her in support. In her testimony, she said the Justice Department needed 'a deeper sense of purpose' and had to be freed from 'inappropriate political intrusion'. She cited Mr Edward Levy, attorney general in the Ford administration, as the last exemplary chief law enforcement officer. In another confirmation hearing yesterday, Mrs Hazel O'Leary, nominated as energy secretary in the Clinton cabinet, predicted a grim future for the nuclear power industry. Although Mrs O'Leary has been working for a Minnesota utility which uses nuclear power, she said that new nuclear plants were not economically competitive, if the cost of construction were included.</p>

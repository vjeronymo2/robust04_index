			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Markets Report: Dollar ebbs lower The dollar weakened further yesterday after the failure of the weekend G7 summit in Naples to produce any form of dollar support package, writes Philip Gawith. This omission had been widely predicted and was discounted in the market. This did not stop traders and investors selling the dollar, but since the market was already short of the currency, levels of activity were not particularly dramatic. Against the D-Mark the dollar slipped sharply, closing in London at DM1.54 from DM1.5741 on Friday, levels last reached in April 1993. The dollar also finished at a new post-war low of Y97.365, from Y98.575 on Friday, against the yen. Losses were pared slightly by uncertainty following the weekend death of the North Korean leader Kim Il-Sung. Dollar weakness continued to set the tone for currency markets in general. The D-Mark remained a leading beneficiary, and maintained its recent strength against most European currencies. It closed at FFr3.436, from FFr3.434, against the French franc. Sterling weakened further against the D-Mark, finishing at DM2.4081 from DM2.4241. These losses were largely offset by gains against the dollar, with sterling finishing at Dollars 1.5638 from Dollars 1.54 on Friday. The sterling index slipped to 79 from 79.1. Analysts remain very gloomy about the short term outlook for the dollar, with most predicting that it will fall further to the Y90-95 range, and DM1.50-55 in the near term. Although the G7 was widely written off before the fact as an irrelevant talk-shop, the fact that it lived down to its reputation - as least as far as the dollar was concerned - was taken by the market as a further reason to sell the currency. The decisive event - moreso than the failure of the final G7 communique to mention currencies - was President Clinton's comments last Friday that the US did not intend to use the dollar as an instrument of trade policy (comments he repeated to reporters yesterday after meeting Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor). Mr David Cocker, economist at Chemical Bank in London, said the president had been unpersuasive. 'The market still believes the US is adopting a trade policy that is happy to see a weaker dollar.' A second concern, following last Friday's strong non-farm payroll numbers in the US, is the relationship between the Treasury and the Federal Reserve. The market is increasingly concerned that the Fed is falling 'behind the game' in terms of combatting inflation. This conclusion is aggravated by the perception that this may be the result of political pressure. Mr Steve Hannah, director of research at IBJ International in London comments: 'The perception that the market has is that Clinton appears to be adopting a policy of benign neglect towards the dollar. If it came to a choice between a weaker dollar or higher interest rates, he would clearly choose the former rather than risk jeopardising the economic recovery.' Mr Hannah said the dollar would continue to weaken 'until a strong consensus emerges that it is too cheap, or the Fed makes aggressive interest rate moves.' The IBJ analyst said neither occurrence seemed likely at the moment, adding that it was far from certain whether even a 50 basis point increase in US rates would be enough. 'While uncertainty about stock and bond markets continues, it is doubtful whether people will want to buy US assets,' said Mr Hannah. He noted that the good performance of European bond and equity markets yesterday, combined with stable currencies, was not a situation that would encourage dollar demand. Improved sentiment in the gilts markets spilled over into the short end of the interest rate futures market. The December short sterling contract settled in London at 93.64, seven basis points up from Friday. Volume was fairly good, with more than 21,000 lots traded. The December euromark contract did even better, trading nearly 58,000 lots to finish at 95.08 from 94.97. Further along the yield curve, the movements were even sharper, with most of the 1995 contracts rising by over 20 basis points. Analysts said there was no real fundamental explanations for these movements. They reflected, instead, greater bullishness about the outlook for bunds and gilts, and a technical rebound from Friday where the market had got itself into an oversold position. In the money markets, German call money firmed to about 5 per cent from 4.9 per cent on Friday as dealers sought to bolster reserves that had been run down over the weekend. The securities repurchase (repo) rate is currently 4.93 per cent. In the UK the Bank of England provided late assistance of Pounds 200m to the money markets after forecasting a shortage of Pounds 650m. It had earlier provided Pounds 150m liquidity. Overnight money traded between 4 1/4 and 6 1/2 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Brothers, we have just received the following news  item: A PLO official spokesman has made the following statement:    The agreement reached in Cairo on the international presence  in Hebron represent a starting point on the path of the  implementation of the UN Security Council Resolution 904, and  other effective measures that provide security for our  Palestinian people in Hebron and in other occupied Palestinian  regions. They also deal with the issue of the armed and  extremists settlers in Hebron and other parts of the West Bank  and Gaza Strip; the need to put an end to their terrorist  activity, their carrying of weapons and other problems, as was  stipulated by UN Security Council Resolution 904. These  measures represent fundamental elements to guarantee the  security of the Palestinian people and provide an effective  international protection in our Palestinian land for our people,  its territories and sanctities.    While the PLO welcomes the participation of a number of  friendly states in the international forces, and their friendly  units, it would like to stress that our people will contribute  toward the facilitation of their mission. The PLO calls on the  government of Israel to provide all the necessary conditions  that will help these forces carry out their duties according to  the appropriate agreement; and help implement the Declaration of  Principles agreement and the UN Security Council Resolution,  which defines the role of these international forces.    The PLO will continue its efforts to guarantee the  implementation of all the provisions regarding security and  protection for our people, and the removal of all terrorist and  settlement hotbeds, and the implementation of the Declaration of  Principle Agreement to secure the entrance of the the  Palestinian forces to the Palestinian land as soon as possible,  and to establish and set up the first Palestinian authority in  this Palestinian land, raise the Palestinian flag, and  consecrate the Palestinian presence.</p>

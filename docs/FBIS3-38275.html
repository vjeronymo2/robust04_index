			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by George Jones and Robert Shrimsley: "Tebbit Gives </F> Backing to Major at a Price"]    [Text] Right-wing Tories led by Lord Tebbit last night  sought to head off a renewed crisis of confidence in Mr Major's  leadership by offering him their support in fending off a  possible leadership challenge later this year.    As ministers issued an urgent appeal to the party to keep  cool heads and calm nerves amid a fresh outbreak of party  infighting, Lord Tebbit rejected criticism that Mr Major was too  weak for the job and should stand down.    "I am very much in favour of Major staying -- and staying  through the next election and on beyond that," he said.    Interviewed on London Weekend Television's Walden programme,  Lord Tebbit made clear that Thatcherite support against a  possible challenge from the Left would be conditional on Mr  Major adopting a more Eurosceptic policy in the campaign for  June's European elections. He said Mr Major would have to make  up his mind on some key issues, even if it meant overruling  Cabinet colleagues.    "My advice would be: Remember the people you fell out with  over European policy aren't the ones who are looking at your  seat at the Cabinet table," he said. "So, you have to make your  mind up, to decide where your friends are, and where the  policies should lie, and then go for it."    He said Mr Major and his colleagues must carry much of the  blame for their situation. They had made some "foolish errors,"  including allowing spending to rise which had resulted in higher  taxes.    Although Lord Tebbit refused to be drawn into a "Major must  go" campaign, the price tag for his support is likely to alarm  moderates, particularly pro-Europeans who feel Mr Major has  already made too many concessions to the sceptics.    Lord Tebbit's intervention came as senior Conservatives  embarked on another frantic bout of damage limitation after Mr  Norman Lamont was reported to have described Mr Major as "weak  and hopeless" and his Back to Basics policies as "nauseating."    Although the former Chancellor claimed he was  "misrepresented," there was undisguised anger among senior  Tories over his undermining Mr Major's latest efforts to  reassert authority.    But Mr Lamont will signal later this week that he does not  regard his political career as over and he is determined to  return to the Cabinet -- though under a new Prime Minister. In  an interview to be broadcast on BBC Radio 4's "On The Ropes"  programme on Thursday [3 February], Mr Lamont will confirm -- as  many Tories suspect -- that he is now emerging as a focus for  dissent to Mr Major on the backbenches.    Mr Lamont, who has not forgiven Mr Major for ditching him as  Chancellor in May after the loss of the Newbury by-election,  makes clear his hopes of returning to the Cabinet depend on a  new Tory leader taking over in Downing Street.    "I think it would be very difficult for me to work with John  Major again," he says. "I don't think that is likely to happen.  But I do want to be in Government again one day -- and I intend  to be."    Most Conservative MPs regard Mr Lamont's hopes of returning  to the Cabinet as fantasy, and even those who are sympathetic to  his plight acknowledge that he made mistakes as Chancellor. One  senior backbencher said Mr Lamont had "destroyed" himself with  his latest intervention.    But there is concern that he could yet play a key role in  unseating Mr Major in the autumn if the Tories are humiliated in  the local and European elections.    Disaffected MPs, fearing disaster at the next General  Election, will search for a "stalking horse" candidate to stand  against Mr Major in November in the hope of triggering a  full-scale leadership election. As Mr Lamont's only hope --  however remote -- of returning to Government lies in a change of  leader, he might he persuaded to stand against Mr Major.    Although he would not stand any chance of winning, any  significant show of opposition to Mr Major could result in him  being forced to stand down.    This could pave the way for a contest between Mr Kenneth  Clarke and Mr Michael Portillo, though some MPs might attempt to  draft an "elder statesman" such as Mr Douglas Hurd or Mr Michael  Heseltine.</p>

			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Survey of International Telecommunications (23): More power now for the users - Equipment Supply Industry / Increased competition and the aftermath of recession have tilted the balance of power away from the telecoms operators towards the users International telecommunications was the industry which stood up best to the the global recession of the early 1990s. While many other industries suffered, telecoms kept going at a strong pace, often on the basis that while one country, trading bloc or applications sector declined, another one, somewhere, was bound to be on the way up. Thus, while the market in Europe, the US and Japan stagnated, telecoms operators, manufacturers and equipment suppliers focused their attentions on the more buoyant markets of parts of South East Asia, the Middle East and Gulf and South America. They also pitched for a share of the massive, but traditionally difficult, Chinese market and made forays into the highly uncertain world of post-communist Russia and eastern Europe. However, while it is true that the telecoms sector survived the recession more or less intact, the prevailing conditions of that period have had a long-term effect. The present shape of the industry is, in part, the direct result of the realities of adapting to, and coping with a massive, worldwide, economic downturn. The other big contributory element is the remarkable increase in international competition in the provision of telecoms equipment and services. It is interesting to note that research undertaken by the public telecommunications organisations (PTOs) in Europe indicates that 80 per cent of their business is in the domestic sector. Of the 20 per cent that is non-domestic traffic, 80 per cent is trans-European rather than intercontinental. Of that European traffic, 90 per cent terminates within 1000 kilometres of its place of origin. So, at first sight then, it might seems odd that European PTOs and other carriers are rushing into global alliances in the way that they are. The reason is competition: the battle to supply and service the world's biggest international companies is under way in earnest. Meanwhile, the combined effects of recession and intense competition lie behind the plethora of mergers, partnerships and alliances which characterise today's telecoms environment. When the recession arrived, manufacturers soon discovered that even wealthy countries, such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE, cut back on infrastructure projects and expected even greater value for money. Tendering processes changed, competition intensified and margins were cut as prospective customers demanded - and won - more comprehensive and generally cheaper technological solutions, supplied to tighter specifications and stringent timetables. It soon became apparent to the big industry players, as well as the second line organisations, that the pace of technological change combined with a new market dynamic, meant that no one company, no matter how big, could any longer claim to be able to develop and supply every component of a telecoms solution. The result has been a rash of affiliations and acquisitions as manufacturer has combined with manufacturer, supplier with supplier and operator with operator in an unprecedented series of industry alliances. Some, such as the proposed Synoptics and Wellfleet merger, the Chipcom and Cisco partnership, the Cisco and Hewlett-Packard relationship and BT's coalition with the Nordic telecom operators, are carefully planned exercises which can be seen to have both immediate and long term benefits for all partners concerned. However, there is a downside. Most mergers are described as alliances and partnerships, rather than take-overs, but in many cases retention of the name of the smaller company is an indication of the potency of its particular brand rather than its continued independence. Some other corporate exercises, although presented as grand designs and strategic alliances, are, in reality, little more than panicky reactions to changed market conditions. It is more than likely that some of these will end in dismal failure. A new report from telecoms strategy consultants, Analysys, supports this conclusion, observing that established names in both the telecoms and computing-services markets could effectively disappear as wave after wave of alliance activity washes over the converging sectors of telecoms and information technology. Alliances are taking place because manufacturers and carriers alike have to fill the gaping holes in their portfolios of offerings if they are to stand any chance in the battle for the mighty budgets of their target customers: the world's largest corporations and multinational businesses. Companies with, or intending to build, global corporate networks have woken up to the fact that telecoms systems can leverage competitive advantage. The telcos have responded with a variety of initiatives, the most radical of which is the concept of 'total outsourcing,' whereby companies hand over complete responsibility for the design, deployment and management of their telecom systems to a carrier and its affiliated suppliers, partners and acolytes. So far, the strategy has not met with great success, since many users, while apparently keen to contemplate a move from private to public networks, are unwilling to abdicate responsibility for a vital corporate lifeline until a number of important issues have been addressed. A key concern is that carriers are carriers, and therefore cannot appreciate the subtleties and nuances of non-telecoms business sectors. Other issues of concern include the poor service and weak customer-care characteristic of some of the European and North American carriers, as well as restrictive contracts, uncertainty over cost comparisons and limited geographical coverage. The telecoms research organisation, CIT, estimates that the total telecom spend by the world's top 1,000 companies will top Pounds 25bn by 2003. It is obvious then, that aspirant providers of global networks and end-to-end service packages must answer user concerns - or fail in a market of massive strategic importance. Carriers are also striving to develop and market the ultimate carrier service: as power and bandwidth continue to become cheaper, business is looking for a true multimedia information exchange system which will interconnect LANs and WANs and provide voice, image, video, data, information processing and even entertainment services across the corporate network. The provider alliance that can provide such a system at the right price  - and that does not necessarily mean the first one to market - will have the world at its feet and emerge as the telecoms carrier equivalent of Atilla the Hun.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Police Minister Moshe Shahal this morning opened  a Civil Guard station at Ma'ale Adumim, the first in the  territories. Speaking at the opening ceremony, he promised that  the Civil Guard units will be limited to patrolling within the  settlement itself. The police minister also said that five other  Civil Guard stations will be opened shortly in the territories.  Reporter Mark Weiss asked Minister Shahal about the  significance of the opening:    [Begin recording] [Shahal] A decision has been taken about  a year ago, and the previous government decided to implement the  idea of having this guard, like in any other parts in Israel. I  think that the significance is that we are looking upon Ma'ale  Adumim as any other town, and we rely on the citizens of this  town to be responsible for their security, to help the police  force. I think this is the political significance of the  decision.    [Weiss] Do you believe this new Civil Guard will be able to  cooperate with the Palestinian police force to be set up under  autonomy?    [Shahal] Well, I think that there will be a need of  cooperation. If the Palestinian police force cares for the  security, to deal with and to prevent crime, I think that it  will be necessary to cooperate on all levels, and we hope that  this is going to happen. Any professional police force need  this kind of cooperation. [end recording] [passage omitted]</p>

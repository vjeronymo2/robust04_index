			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yun Xiliang (1926 1585 5328): "Comments on </F> `Ownership as a Method, Not an End'"]    [Text] Recently the argument that "ownership is a method,  not an end" has been prevalent. From this argument, some people  have concluded that taking public ownership as the essence of  socialism is "mistaking the method for the goal and trying to  defend it." Being a method, public ownership is in a subordinate  position when compared with goal of socialism. Development of  productive forces is the end. Whatever ownership is conducive to  economic development should be promoted. If the publicly owned  sector of the economy gradually dwindles because it is unsuited  to market competition, such outcome, from an overall viewpoint,  is good for the development of our productive forces, the  strengthening of our comprehensive national strength, and the  improvement of the people's living standard.    This view is an obvious mistake.    Here, first of all, let us explain the relationship between  social practice and the nature of society. Our social  practice--for example, we take the quick development of  productive forces as our primary task--is bound up with the fact  that our society is socialist in nature. So any practice  conducive to consolidating and developing the socialist system  must be protected. Any practice with an adverse effect on this  must be restricted and banned. From this viewpoint, building a  modern socialist society is our end, while developing productive  forces is the method to achieve that end. Sometimes we may say  developing productive forces is our end, but that is based on  the premise that our system is a socialist system--what we mean  is that in socialist society we should take the development of  productive forces as our work target or fundamental task. In  fact, ownership hinges directly on the nature, or system, of  society. Leaving primitive communist society aside, in slave  society the means of production was owned by slave owners. In  feudal society, it was owned by feudal lords, and in capitalist  society, by capitalists. In socialist society it is, of course,  owned by the whole people and the collectives. This is common  knowledge.    China is now in the initial stage of socialism. Because of  our relatively backward economy and based on the experience and  lessons drawn from the past, our party and government are  carrying out a policy of coexistence and co-development of  several economic sectors in order to speed up the development of  social productive forces. This policy allows the existence of  enterprises owned by individuals as well as enterprises run with  private capital, with Chinese and foreign capital, and with sole  foreign capital. Now, all these types of enterprises have  developed to some extent. This is absolutely correct. Meanwhile,  however, our party and government have unequivocally stipulated  that the state-owned and collective economic sectors, that is,  the publicly owned sectors, should still dominate our economy.  The non-state-owned sectors, they say, should remain  supplementary, or in other words, in a subordinate position.  This is the basic principle for socialist modernization. Our  socialist politics, culture, education, science and technology,  and military affairs should all follow this principle and serve  the purpose of developing social productive forces. Above all,  they should serve the purpose of defending and reinforcing the  mainstay position of public ownership. Failing this or acting to  the contrary will impair our cause of socialist construction.    To substantiate this, we would like to quote some relevant  viewpoints held by our proletarian revolutionary teachers. In  the preface to the 1888 English edition of "Manifesto of the  Communist Party," Engels said: "The fundamental proposition  which forms the nucleus of this Manifesto' belongs to Marx. That  proposition is: In every historical epoch, the prevailing mode  of economic production and exchange, and the social organization  necessarily following from it, form the basis upon which is  built up, and from which alone can be explained, the political  and intellectual history of that epoch." (Selected Works  of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, Vol. I, p. 237). This  means that the nature of a society is mainly determined by the  mode of material production in that society, or in other words,  the condition of productive forces and the corresponding  production relations in that society. With the development of  productive forces, human history has developed from a low to a  high level through five kinds of production relations, namely,  production relations of primitive communism, the slave system,  feudalism, capitalism, and socialism (communism). Commensurate  with the different economic bases are five basic forms of  society, which have appeared successively. They are: primitive  society, slave society, feudal society, capitalist society, and  socialist society (communist society).    Therefore, to determine the nature of a society, we  should, first of all, look into its economic base. Lenin said:  "Only by attributing social relations to production relations  and attributing production relations to the level of productive  forces, can we have a reliable basis to view the development of  forms of society as a natural historical process."  (Collected Works of V.I. Lenin, Second Edition, Vol.  I, p. 110)    If the nature of society is determined by production  relations, which are connected with the condition of productive  forces, then there must be an inner link between the ownership  system, which is the basis of production relations, and the  nature of society. In fact, most people acknowledge that the  ownership system is a major criterion for judging the nature of  society. The fundamental reason for the socialist nature of  contemporary Chinese society is that it has public ownership as  its main foundation. Similarly, the fundamental reason for the  capitalist nature of society of Western developed countries is  that their society is founded mainly on private ownership.    The link between the ownership system and the nature of  society and the importance of the ownership system to social  development were clearly expounded long ago by the founders of  scientific socialism. In the Manifesto of the Communist  Party, they declared to the whole world: "The  distinguishing feature of Communism is not the abolition of  property generally, but the abolition of bourgeois property. But  modern bourgeois private property is the final and most complete  expression of the systems of producing and appropriating  products, that is based on class antagonisms, on the  exploitation of the many by the few. In this sense, the theory  of the communists may be summed up in the single sentence:  Abolition of private property." (Selected Works of Karl  Marx and Frederick Engels, Vol. I, p. 265)    Now, everyone acknowledges that elimination of  exploitation is the essence of socialism. But how is  exploitation to be eliminated? By relying on the exploiters'  mercy? Or by relying on open-minded rulers? These are merely  utopian socialism. Can we merely rely on the development of  productive forces to eliminate exploitation? If so, how come  developed capitalist countries, which have a very high level of  productive forces, cannot eliminate exploitation? To eliminate  exploitation, it is imperative to replace private ownership with  public ownership. This is an irrefutable truth.    In addition, everyone acknowledges that elimination of  polarization is also the essence of socialism. How can  polarization be eliminated? The history of the world has proved  that polarization cannot be eliminated in any society with  private ownership. Peasants of feudal society once rose up to  struggle for equal land rights, but their struggle ended in  failure. During the bourgeois revolutionary period, some  thinkers stood for the elimination of economic inequality, only  to find that their ideal was no more than a beautiful bubble.  Reality in the 20th century has made people aware that only by  replacing private ownership with public ownership is it possible  to eliminate polarization.    As can be seen, elimination of exploitation and  polarization is bound up with public ownership. Their  relationship, it may be said, is just like the two sides of a  coin. An inner link exists between public ownership and the  essence of socialism, and there is no doubt about it.    Productive forces are the most dynamic factor for social  development. The condition of productive forces determines the  nature of production relations, while the development of  productive forces determines the changes in production  relations. This, however, cannot be construed to mean that the  condition of productive forces alone is a direct determinant of  the nature of society.    The histories of countries in the world have repeatedly  proved that, under roughly the same condition of productive  forces, the nature of society varies from country to country.  For example, under the condition of modern productive forces,  some countries have capitalist society, while others have  socialist society. This is because their specific environments  are different. Even under the same condition of productive  forces, when a country is fettered by production relations that  are incompatible with the condition of its productive forces, it  may have one form of society, but after it has replaced the  outdated production relations with advanced production relations  that are commensurate with the condition of its productive  forces, it may have another form of society.    It follows that the condition of productive forces, albeit  a vital determinant of social development, does not necessarily  reflect the nature of society. The direct determinant of the  nature of society is production relations. In other words, the  nature of society is determined by production relations based on  certain productive forces. Here, production relations refer to  the dominant relations of production at a certain stage of the  development of human society, that is, the basic economic system  of society. Consequently, we may say that the basic economic  system of society based on certain productive forces directly  determines the nature of society.    Is the conclusion that production relations directly  determines the nature of society in conflict with the thesis  that productive forces serve as the criterion for economic work?  No. It does not deny the fact that productive forces are always  the most revolutionary element of economic activities in  society, and that the development of productive forces  invariably determines the changes in production relations.    Productive forces and production relations complement,  condition, and promote each other. In China, persisting in using  productive forces as the criterion for economic work is  associated with adherence to the basic socialist economic  system. All views and practices making them mutually exclusive  are harmful. If we say that the idea "we would rather have the  grass of socialism" is to sever from an extremely leftist stand  the inner link between using productive forces as the criterion  for economic work and implementing the basic socialist economic  system, then stressing the importance of productive forces in an  abstract, isolated, and lopsided way is to sever that link from  a rightist stand. "To stress the four modernizations without  stressing socialism is to forget the essence of the matter."  (Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, Vol. III, p. 204)    Productive forces are connected with production relations  both in substance and in form. In a certain sense, developing  productive forces may be considered as the end. But this does  not mean that public ownership can be downgraded to a low,  subordinate position and is no longer a decisive factor for the  essence of socialism.    In any society, economic progress has to rely on a variety  of methods. Undoubtedly, many methods have no inner link with  the essence of society and may be considered to be in a low and  subordinate position. For example, plans and markets may be used  as economic methods by capitalism as well as by socialism, for  they have no inner link with the essence of society. But this is  not the case of public ownership. As a basic economic system,  public ownership should in no way be downgraded to an  unimportant, low, and subordinate position.    Moreover, the end and method can be transformed into each  other. As far as productive forces versus production relations  are concerned, the former is the end. But, when we talk about  the essence of socialism (liberating and developing productive  forces and eliminating exploitation and polarization so as to  finally achieve common affluence), the end is to "finally  achieve common affluence," while developing and liberating  productive forces are methods to achieve this end. In this case,  can we say that development of productive forces is placed in a  low, subordinate position? Obviously not. Development of  productive forces and common affluence also complement and  condition each other. In socialist society, on the one hand,  development of productive forces must be subordinate to the  objective of satisfying the people's material and cultural  needs; otherwise, "production would be for the sake of  production." On the other hand, without developing productive  forces, it would be impossible to provide abundant materials and  products and, hence, impossible to achieve common affluence. For  this reason, we must take a comprehensive look at the  relationship between developing productive forces and achieving  common affluence. Even though development of production should  be subordinate to the people's needs, development of productive  forces is still the practical starting point and plays a  dominant role in the whole economic process. So development of  productive forces must be regarded as a fundamental task of  socialism.    To sum up, both productive forces and production relations  play a vital role in determining the nature of society.  Absolutely exaggerating the role of productive forces and  believing that once we have developed our productive forces, we  would not slip to the capitalist road no matter what ownership  system we have adopted is as much a mistake as absolutely  exaggerating the role of production relations and believing that  with a large and collective organization, we would transit to a  communist society despite our backward productive forces.  Similarly, the thinking that socialism can be realized in the  absence of public ownership is as absurd as the thinking that  socialism can be achieved without developing productive forces  and with a poverty-stricken society.    Lopsidedly stressing that the ownership system is a method  is aimed at nothing but weaken, eliminate, and change public  ownership.    Is it possible to get a better effect on developing  China's productive forces by weakening, eliminating, and change  public ownership? No. As shown by the history of the last 100  years or so, China did not quicken the development of productive  forces whether it was dominated by the feudal system,  semi-feudal and semi-colonial system, or bureaucrat capitalism.  On the contrary, when such systems held sway, the people were  often suffering hunger and cold, and sometimes dead bodies of  the starved were found here and there. After the founding of the  People's Republic of China, the national economy quickly revived  from the awful mess left from old China. On the heels of such  revival was a large-scale economic construction. All these  relied upon the socialist system based on public ownership.  Though once we erred by arbitrarily pursuing a "large and  collective" organization, we have never destroyed the socialist  system. Since the 1980's, our productive forces have developed  at a quickened pace. What we have relied upon is still the  socialist system with public ownership as the mainstay.    Public ownership as the mainstay is a very important aspect  of Chinese socialism and a basic socialist principle we must  keep to. The ongoing reform is a process of further improvement  of the public ownership system. This improvement means a change  in the system and mechanism of public ownership to meet the  needs of developing productive forces. It differs radically from  weakening, eliminating, and changing public ownership. Only by  improving the public ownership system can we achieve better  results in fulfilling the basic task of developing productive  forces. This is a fundamental principle for building socialism.    In China, the economic sector owned by the whole people and  the enterprises owned by the state were and still are leading  forces in ensuring the fast development of the national economy.  In the first place, they have relatively advanced technology and  equipment, large numbers of competent professionals, and the  masses of hard-working and discipline-abiding workers. They are,  therefore, the most advanced part of productive forces in our  society and represent the orientation for the development of  productive forces. Secondly, they always play a leading role in  industrial production, transportation, financial affairs, and  commodity circulation. Thirdly, they are the chief financial  source for the state. Fourthly, they serve the people across the  country and play a pillar role in strengthening macroeconomic  regulation and control. It is due to the leading role played by  the economic sector owned by the whole people that China's  economic construction and its reform and opening-up drive have  scored such remarkable achievements as to attract worldwide  attention.    Some people say that enterprises owned by the whole people  cannot compare with enterprises owned by collectives and  individuals. They argue that our economic growth since the start  of the reform and opening-up drive has resulted mainly from the  growth of the economic sector not owned by the whole people.  This viewpoint is superficial and groundless. It must be noted  that the rapid growth of the economic sector not owned by the  whole people has depended, to a great extent, on the support  provided by the economic sector owned by the whole people.  State-owned enterprises have provided necessary raw materials,  energy, and transportation facilities as well as lots of  technology, equipment, and manpower to the economic sector not  owned by the whole people. Moreover, this economic sector has  reaped a large amount of profits from the state's tax-reduction  and exemption policy and, in particular, from the low prices of  products made by state-owned enterprises. Because of this, the  following situation has appeared in China: Despite its advanced  equipment, competent work force, and enormous capital, the  state-owned economic sector is growing slowly, while the whole  economy and the non-state-owned sector are making quick headway.  With regard to the above-mentioned situation, Vice President  Rong Yiren said very clearly in his November 1993 speech in  Tianjin: "Today, without support from state-owned large and  medium-sized enterprises, no other enterprise could enjoy  lasting prosperity whether it is a township enterprise, an  enterprise in the foreign-funded enterprise category, or any  other enterprises not owned by the public. State-owned big and  medium-sized enterprises were, are, and will continue to be the  pillar of China's national economy." No doubt, this conclusion  is quite correct.</p>

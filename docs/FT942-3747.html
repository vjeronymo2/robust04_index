			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Pay policy frozen out at leading US ice-cream maker The cold reality that top US executives demand high salary cheques has triumphed over pay policy idealism at Ben &amp; Jerry's Homemade, the small Vermont company which has grown into a leading ice-cream manufacturer thanks to its delicious, offbeat frozen concoctions and socially-conscious image. The company, which created premium ice creams with names such as Wavy Gravy, Chunky Monkey and Cherry Garcia, said yesterday it was discontinuing a policy that its highest paid employee could not be paid more than seven times the amount of its lowest paid employee. But the company is hardly abandoning its alternative image. Launching a search for a chief executive to aid its expansion, it said that applicants must explain in 100 words 'Why I would be a Great CEO for Ben &amp; Jerry's'. The contest, according to Mr Ben Cohen, the chairman who is giving up the chief executive post, will uncover candidates who have 'both the broad experience and gentleness of spirit necessary to guard and grow the company's unique, community-focused culture.' Ben &amp; Jerry's, which recently launched its ice-creams in Britain, was founded in 1977 with a single ice-cream parlour, based in a converted petrol station, by Mr Cohen and Mr Jerry Greenfield, its vice-chairman. From the start they adopted a socially conscious approach to business and a personal style reminiscent of the 1960s hippie movement. The company donates 7.5 per cent of its pre-tax profits to a foundation which supports non-profit organisations and charities. It also buys some of its ice-cream ingredients from socially disadvantaged groups. The pay ratio limit (originally set at five-to-one but changed to seven-to-one in 1991) was designed to make employees feel they were working as part of a team. The company said yesterday the ratio had served it well when it was younger and smaller but it had become a barrier to recruiting experienced people. Ben &amp; Jerry's had net income last year of Dollars 7.2m on revenues of Dollars 140m but Mr Chuck Lacy, its president and top paid executive, earned only Dollars 150,000 (Pounds 99,000), less than many senior executives at businesses of this size.</p>

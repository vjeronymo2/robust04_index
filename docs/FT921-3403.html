			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Appointments: Scottish Film Council's local hero Allan Shiach, executive chairman of Macallan Distillers who doubles as Allan Scott, the Hollywood screenwriter, becomes chairman of the 11-man board of the Scottish Film Council on April 1. He replaces John Donarchy, who has been in the chair since 1984 and negotiated the Council's independence from the Scottish Council for Education Technology two years ago. Shiach's pseudonym, developed at university 'because extra-curricular activities such as television were banned', was also chosen 'as the most patriotic he could think of'. Now, the scriptwriter of many films - Don't Look Now is one of the best remembered - spoke this week from Los Angeles in temperatures of 78 degrees F of his keenness to lend a helping hand to his native film industry in less clement parts. Unsurprisingly, one of his primary tasks will be to improve the funding of the Council, looking further afield than the current Scottish Office grant. As the only council board member who is also a member of the Scottish Film Production Fund, which promotes young film-makers, he is keen to secure a merger with that and possibly other Scottish film industry industry bodies to strengthen his fund-raising hand. Since the role of the council is primarily that of 'preserving a Scottish film culture', the archive turns out to be a big concern. It irks him considerably, for instance, that another Scottish whisky company recently donated its film archive south of the border to the British Film Institute. 'I would hope to be able to intervene on that sort of thing during my incumbency.' Other patriotic activities this year for Shiach, 50, who owns homes in London and Moray, include writing the screen play for a 'strictly low-budget film' based on Pat Barker's novel Regeneration, centreing on the 1917 meeting, in the Scottish asylum of Craiglockhart, between Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon.</p>

			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / The Property Market: Paris: a tale of two halves The government is trying to tilt the city's axis to the east in an effort to spread wealth to a deprived part of the capital, which suffers from industrial dereliction and the concentration of decision-makers in the west. To help the process, it is prepared to move one of its key government ministries to the east. But the project's momentum is threatened by the poor state of the market after a fall-off of demand and a surge in building following a relaxation of controls. The description fits both London and Paris. This tale of two cities contains many parallels, although the contrasts are perhaps even more striking. Tax incentives and laissez-faire planning policies have been at the heart of developing London's east end in recent years. The development of Paris, however, is being forged by a policy of interventionism, extravagant government gestures and partnerships between the public and private sectors. As with London, the need to regenerate eastern Paris was recognised by the authorities in the 1970s. But it was not until 1983 that the Council of Paris drew up its planned programme for east Paris. The proposals have been reinforced with the region's structure plan, the Livre Blanc, published in 1990, and blueprints drawn up by Mr Jacques Chirac, the mayor of Paris, which featured 'Zacs' - partnerships between the public and private sectors. Both London and Paris have been confronted with the challenge of changing the image of their eastern districts. In spite of being close to the heart of Paris, the eastern arrondissements of the city have more than their share of urban blight, poor housing and high unemployment. Although the eastern arrondissements are not as cut off from the centre as London's Docklands, there is a need for improved transport. A new metro will be completed by 1996, cutting the journey from Bercy to Gare St Lazare from 20 to 6 1/2 minutes. In Paris, some grand projects, most notably the new opera house built on the site of the old Bastille railway station, created a wave of publicity. Yet more publicity was generated with the launch of the Seine Rive Gauche development, a new business district which will eventually stretch along both banks of the Seine in the 12th and 13th arrondissements. Developers are also trying to inject some life into the area. Bercy village, which is due to be completed in the next two years, is a shopping district located in renovated wine warehouses and their vaulted cellars, with more than 100 restaurants and boutiques. Perhaps the most significant development has been Euro-Disney, 32km to the east. Many French people are sceptical about its influence, but its supporters believe that the publicity before its opening earlier this year and the sheer number of visitors will be a huge boost to the eastern side. The government has moved its ministry of finance from the Louvre to a huge edifice in Bercy. In spite of the architectural merits of the Bercy premises, the move was not welcomed by officials. 'It is rather like taking the UK home office to Croydon (in south London),' says Mr Robert Waterland, president of surveyors Jones Lang Wootton, Paris. Bercy has yet to win the hearts of Parisians. Changing the character of an area and the preconceptions of its citizens takes time. The growth of the east will also be affected by the fall in the Paris property market. 'The east is in danger of losing its economic edge,' says Mr Waterland. The Seine Rive Gauche scheme resulted in a bout of speculative fever in 1988-89. 'In anticipation of the success of the project, developers were quick to buy sites in surrounding areas, trusting that the idea of a new office pole would be enough to attract occupiers. In a less buoyant market, however, take-up has been lower than expected,' says Jones Lang Wootton. If the intention of moving the finance ministry to Bercy was to establish a new financial district in the area, the task is likely to be a lengthy one. Societe Generale, the French bank, had been interested in relocating to another development area on the left bank of the Seine, but it could not reach agreement on the price of land and so decided to move to La Defense. But it would be a mistake to underestimate the government's powers of persuasion. While the UK government has used rates holidays and tax breaks - with mixed success - to develop London's Docklands, the French government has rather more direct influence over company relocations. Tenants need to win official approval before they take on large amounts of new space. Moreover, developments on the western side of Paris are being discouraged. In 1988 Mr Michel Rocard, then prime minister, announced measures to favour the less sought-after eastern suburbs of Paris, away from the popular area of La Defense. 'Ten years from now it will be comparable to La Defense,' says Mr Jean-Pierre Hennequet, managing director of the New Bercy project, which comprises Bercy village along with 50,000 square metres of offices, a food and drink trade centre, a hotel, conference centre and cinema in the old wine district. The comparison is pertinent. Indeed when London and Paris compare notes, the parallel is usually drawn is between La Defense and Docklands. La Defense, like London's Docklands, is seen as a less expensive alternative to the central business district and, like Docklands, it has not always had an easy ride. However, there the similarities end. The French government has had a hands-on involvement with the project, most notably with its generous provision of transport links. The origins of La Defense date back to President Georges Pompidou, who was keen to develop a business capital, partly, it was said, in a bid to accommodate the offices of the European Community. The plan was slow to get off the ground. 'After the oil slump of the 1970s it was a disaster,' says Mr Colin Bird of DTZ, the international agency of surveyors Debenham Tewson &amp; Chinnocks. 'We were trying to let buildings at rents that would cover the service charges.' Since then La Defense has taken off: it is prestigious, well connected and cheaper than the central business district, where the typical office building is more than 100-years-old and lacks large floor spaces and air-conditioning. 'It has a good image, better than the Golden Triangle (the area at the heart of Paris) in some respects,' says Mr Jean-Pierre Pajon of Gleeds, a long established UK firm of quantity surveyors in Paris. When the US brokers Salomons visited La Defense it was impressed with its list of prestigious tenants. 'If Brussels is the political capital of Europe, then La Defense is the corporate capital of modern Europe,' it concluded. La Defense is not to everyone's taste. It is often described as a concrete jungle; many Parisians shudder at the idea of living there, even though it has some 200 shops, 20 restaurants and nine cinemas. The most recent example of government intervention in Paris is the Grande Arche de la Defense. This hollowed-out cube would easily accommodate Notre Dame and its towers. Its alignment with I M Pei's glass pyramid in the courtyard of the Louvre museum, the obelisk of the Place de la Concorde and the Arc de Triomphe adds to its monumental qualities. In spite of its emphasis on the development of the east, the French government has not turned its back on La Defense. In August 1990 it unveiled a Fr10bn urban development scheme that will double La Defense's area and extend the thoroughfare starting at the Louvre a further two miles past La Defense. The emphasis will be on housing. Paris is currently an unlikely model of planning and development. The city has been hit hard by the slump in the property market, following temporary planning deregulation in the mid-1980s which led to an increase in supply. None the less vacancy rates are among the lowest of any European capital at less than 5 per cent. And by avoiding the laissez-faire policies of other European markets, Paris has escaped the peaks and troughs of the US and UK. On current evidence, the regeneration of the French capital's eastern districts is likely to be more successful than the comparable efforts in London.</p>

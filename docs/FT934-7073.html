			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / ITV faces flood of takeovers An announcement that could set off the greatest ever burst of takeover activity among ITV companies is likely this week. The government is expected to give details of a significant degree of liberalisation of the ownership rules governing ITV companies. The signs are that the most restrictive forms of change, allowing only one or two companies to change hands, have been rejected. At the moment the nine largest ITV companies are unable to take each other over under the 1990 Broadcasting Act. A liberalisation that would allow one company to hold two large licences plus one of the smallest six ITV licences would enable a considerable degree of consolidation to take place in the ITV system. Under such a scenario, Carlton Communications could take over Central, Granada could take over LWT, and MAI, the controlling company in Meridian Television, could take over Anglia. The share prices of many ITV companies have been rising in recent weeks and immediate takeover bids are likely to get under way as soon as the government confirms the details of the new rules. Barriers are likely to remain in place to prevent the takeover of HTV or Scottish Television by other large ITV companies or the two London licences being owned by the same company. No matter how many companies change hands, each broadcasting licence will remain separate and the Independent Television Commission will ensure that all programme obligations are honoured. Some details of the plan are still being worked out and no announcement is expected today.</p>

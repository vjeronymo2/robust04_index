			<p><P> May 12, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. MILITARY ASSISTANCE TO EL SALVADOR  </P> <P> Your editorial on El Salvador is correct in its focus on the abuse of military  power. However, your own unquestioned assumption that the U.S. should "lay  into" El Salvador, that our military advisers should even be trying to  "professionalize" the Salvadoran armed forces, is the real root of the problem.  </P> <P> Why does the military still refuse to "answer to civilian authority?" Because  70% of all U.S. aid over the past 10 years has gone directly or indirectly to  the armed forces on top of 40% of El Salvador's own annual budget. After a  decade of U.S. intervention in a country one-seventh the size of Illinois, the  per capita income has declined 25%, only 20% of the employable population has  permanent work, and the armed forces have quintupled in size.  </P> <P> For every single priest who has been murdered, thousands of workers and  peasants have met the same fate. Torture, disappearance and assassination are  commonly practiced by the army we support. Instead of laying into El Salvador,  why not stop all military aid and channel humanitarian assistance through  reliable international agencies? Conrad has it right. The cross of the  Salvadoran people is made in the U.S.A.  </P> <P> JERRY A. IRISH  </P> <P> Claremont  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Fields of Spring"] </F>   [Text] This year work in the fields began almost 10 days  earlier than it did last year. The sowing of perennial grasses  is now being finished up. Among the first to succeed in this  task were farms located in the Crimean Republic, as well as in  Volyn, Zhitomir, Zakarpat, Zaporozhye, Lvov, and Nikolayev  oblasts.    Because of the lack of mineral fertilizers--the present  demand for them is being satisfied only to the extent of 17  percent--the vitalization of winter crops has been restricted.    Winter crops have been resown on 1,013,400 hectares,  including grains and legumes on 939,400 hectares. According to  the latest data, the area of ruined winter crops will reach 2.5  million hectares.    The Crimean Republic, as well as Odessa, Nikolayev, Kherson,  Zakarpat, and Chernigov oblasts have successfully coped with the  tasks of sowing early spring crops and resowing winter ones.    Work has begun on sowing sugar beets, in which close to 1.5  million hectares have been planted. Taking part in this work  have been farms in the Vinnitsa, Odessa, Chernigov, Nikolayev,  Cherkassy, and Kiev regions.</p>

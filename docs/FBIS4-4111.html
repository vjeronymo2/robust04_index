			<p>BFN     [Text] Macao, April 27 (XINHUA) -- China is willing to  exchange views and make research on human rights with other  countries, however, any attempt to use human rights as a tool to  put pressure on others would be fruitless.    Wu Yi, minister of the Chinese Foreign Trade and Economic  Cooperation, made these remarks at a news conference held here  this evening.    She said the question of the most favored nation (MFN)  trading status was a core item in the trade agreement signed  between the governments of China and the United States when the  two countries established diplomatic relations in 1979, adding  it is also the fundamental basis for the trade development  between the two sides.    Wu said MFN is purely a question of trading, saying that  China will absolutely not accept any attempt to connect MFN with  matters which have nothing to do with trade, especially the  human rights.    She said that at present, China has set up trade relations  with 228 countries and regions worldwide and is not afraid of  confrontations that would take place over MFN.    She expressed the hope that the United States would properly  deal with the MFN issue, saying confrontation will be harmful to  both China and the U.S.</p>

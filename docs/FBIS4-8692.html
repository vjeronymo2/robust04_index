			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Lajos Fur, defense minister and chairman of </F> the Hungarian Democratic Forum, by Janos Papp; place and date  not given: "Many Possible Chances -- Lajos Fur in Nagykovacsi"]    [Text] At the campaign meeting of the Hungarian Democratic  Forum [MDF] on 12 April, Lajos Fur gave a speech on the  activities of the Hungarian parliament and Government and on the  achievements of the MDF. Among other things, he said that the  government has many times been called a dilettante, mainly by  the left wing, and at other times it was accused of lack of  expertise, but the facts prove otherwise. Parliament has  functioned undisturbed in the past four years and it created  more than 400 laws. The MDF and its partners were able to  ensure the country's security and stability and, owing to the  population's wisdom, calmness and discipline were preserved. It  is not by chance that, at the end of the four-year governmental  cycle, the MDF is thanking the Hungarian people for calm and  cooperation. Lajos Fur spoke about establishing the conditions  for economic boom, settling the ownership relations in  agriculture, and finally he said that a healthy national  self-esteem is needed and, being aware of this, people will  decide in favor of continuing on the current road.    Lajos Fur gave an interview to our correspondent after the  campaign meeting.    [Papp] To what extent does the result of the nomination of  candidates that ended on 8 April justify the former statements  according to which the Polish syndrome, where parties belonging  to the fragmented center and the right wing excluded themselves  from the possibility of governing, may be repeated in Hungary?    [Fur] The Hungarian political forces are not as fragmented  as they were in Poland. Several outcomes are still possible  here. The contest will be decided between the left wing and the  center or center-right forces. I can still see a great chance  that the some 40 percent of the electors who still have not  decided whether to vote at all will, in the remaining three to  four weeks, decide to support the center and right-wing forces,  rather than the left wing.    [Papp] During their discussions with the current socialist  leaders of the former communist countries, the left-wing  politicians spend much time talking about the issue of the  interest representation of Hungarians living beyond the border.  What are your views on this?    [Fur] I could put it this way: Recently, everyone seems to  have become a very true Hungarian. People who previously spoke  about Christian regime, preached or screeched about the yokels'  style of showing one's being a true Hungarian, have now suddenly  realized that they support the Christian churches, and they  foster the cause of Hungarians beyond the border; many such  campaign measures have been included in the propaganda of  certain parties recently. I hope that the public will remember  what the same people said about the church, Christianity, and  the Hungarians a few months ago. They will also hopefully  remember how our critics voted in Parliament on these issues.    [Papp] The Socialists have not named their prime ministerial  candidate and Prime Minister Peter Boross objected to this a few  days ago.    [Fuir] Yes, there is some mysticism in this issue. The  former communists and post-communists always adhered to the  practice that they did not inform anyone about their decision,  they thought they would make their decisions internally and then  let the public know later. I am afraid that this is again a  case of the old reflexes.</p>

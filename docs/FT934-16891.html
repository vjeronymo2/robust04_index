			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Fiat holds talks on European alliances to cut costs MR GIANNI AGNELLI, the Fiat chairman, said his company had been discussing possible alliances with other European car-markers to tackle overcapacity and high production costs. Though nothing had come of these talks, he said further significant consolidation of the European car business was inevitable. It would perhaps be triggered by one of the bigger manufacturers drawing clearly ahead of the rest. Mr Agnelli would not identify companies with which Fiat might co-operate. But he said that 'in Europe, there are too many brands. I think we need to reduce them'. He explained: 'If something happens, and one producer rises to 24 per cent of the market, then the whole thing starts moving.' The European car market is split between six main producers, with Volkswagen, the biggest, accounting for about 17 per cent. Fiat last week announced a L966bn (Pounds 400m) net loss for the first half of 1993, caused by the steep fall in demand for cars in Europe. Fiat, which last week launched Italy's biggest rights issue, also said it would sell its 58 per cent stake in La Rinascente, Italy's biggest retailing group, to generate additional funds. Ifil, the quoted investment company dominated by Agnelli family interests, is a likely buyer. The disposal is likely to generate an extraordinary gain of L437bn. Mr Agnelli added that the need for austerity would put pressure on Fiat's ability to pay a dividend. Stressing that a decision was still up to the board next May, he hoped it would at least be possible to pay holders of Fiat's non-voting savings stock. A patriarch constrained, Page 13</p>

			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Bosnians agree to an ethnic divide THE LEADERS of Bosnia-Hercegovina yesterday claimed a breakthrough in European Community-sponsored talks on the future of the Yugoslav republic when they agreed in principle to an independent state divided into three separate areas along ethnic and geographic lines. The document, called a statement of principles, appeared to pave the way for international recognition of Bosnia as an independent state. Diplomats say it is likely the EC and the US will jointly recognise Bosnia early next month. The accord would give the Slavic Moslems, Serbs and Croats regional control over their local economies, culture, health and education, leaving foreign and macro-economic policy to a collective government and parliament. It appeared to be an attempt by the leaders of Bosnia's three main national groups to defuse rising ethnic tensions which many fear could explode into a civil war. But the agreement left unresolved where the new boundaries would be drawn to separate the intertwined ethnic groups in Bosnia's 4.4m population. It also did not define future control over the police and the armed forces. According to western diplomats, the Serb-controlled federal army now has an estimated 100,000 troops in Bosnia. Diplomats in Belgrade, the Serbian and federal capital, were cautious about the accord. 'This is a little progress, but don't be deceived,' said a western diplomat. 'It is a journey of many miles'. Mr Jose Cutilhiero, a Portuguese diplomat who chaired the two-day talks, said it would take some long negotiations before a draft constitution could be drawn up. The agreement seemed to represent a concession by Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Moslem president of Bosnia, who has opposed the division of Bosnia into ethnic units. Moslems, who comprise 43 per cent of the population, fear the republics of Serbia and Croatia will now move to annex parts of Bosnia, leaving the Moslems without a homeland. Mr Radovan Karadzic, the leader of Bosnia's Serbs, has consistently rejected an independent Bosnia. Many Serbs have raised roadblocks in Bosnia in protest against the 'yes vote' in the independence referendum on March 1.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] One hundred fifty-eight PLO officers and staff last  night flew out from Tunis aboard a special Tunisian plane  chartered by Saudi Arabia to Egypt, their last stop before they  proceed to the Gaza Strip. The group, officially regarded a  part of the Palestine Liberation Army, is comprised of personnel  who served over the past few years on PLO-related civic duties.  They will travel by bus from Egypt to the crossing point in  Rafah tomorrow, Sunday, on their way to the Gaza Strip.</p>

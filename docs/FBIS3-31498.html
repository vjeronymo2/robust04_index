			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Budapest, 16 Feb (MTI) -- The Defence Committee of  Hungarian Parliament on Wednesday [16 February] held a hearing  for Lieutenant General Janos Deak, whom the minister of defence  proposed for the post of commander of the Hungarian Army. The  committee unanimously supported the nomination.    The general, who is also chief-of-staff of the Army, is to  replace Colonel-General Kalman Lorincz, who is retiring. The  appointment will be signed by the president of the Republic of  Hungary, who is the commander-in-chief of the Army.    During the 90-minute hearing, Deak stated that the mood  among  officers is not too good. He said that improving this is not  merely a financial issue, but that the social prestige of  military careers must also be increased.    There is presently a shortage of officers out among the  troops, according to Deak. On the other hand, there are 13,000  officers in the army. In his view, this number is overly high  and should be readjusted to around 8,000. Deak also said  replacements should be ensured not merely from the military  colleges, but also from the university of arts and sciences, and  the technical university.</p>

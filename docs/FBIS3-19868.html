			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Achille Occhetto, Democratic Party of the </F> Left secretary, by Gabriele Paci; place and date not given: "I  Promise Sacrifices"]    [Text] [Paci] Honorable Occhetto, if the "progressive pole"  wins, with whom will you govern Italy, and what will you do?    [Occhetto] First, continue with the politics of  economic-financial recovery and elimination of the government  deficit begun by the Ciampi government. In fact, this is the  premise for saving the lira, attracting foreign investors --  whom I had the opportunity to convince even during my recent  trips in Europe -- and to launch a serious employment policy.    [Paci] What do you mean by "serious?"    [Occhetto] It means that, on the basis of previous  statements, employment policy needs a strong innovation. The  old social policy of the Left was reflected in short-term  programs. We avoided them this time. Instead, we presented a  program in which all the policies -- financial, economic, social  -- converge, I would say in an almost obsessive manner, in a  single objective: employment.    [Paci] Even the Center and Right pledge a great commitment  to  employment.    [Occhetto] Saying to the Italians: We will resolve your  problems in one day, means acting like showmen. Instead, we are  saying to the Italians: Even if the progressives win, we will  have to pull up our shirt sleeves, and to make sacrifices to  achieve the objectives of recovery and employment. Of course,  everybody will have to make sacrifices, possibly starting with  all those who have never made any for the past 50 years.    [Paci] And the welfare state?    [Occhetto] The traditional policy of the welfare state can  be  revised without affecting productivity and austerity.    [Paci] I repeat, with which forces, would you actuate the  policy of the "progressives?"    [Occhetto] With the forces that are willing to implement it.  Do not forget that already in the past, an extremely vast front  was constituted to win the referendum.    [Paci] Therefore, everything will be like during the times  of  proportional representation: First the elections and then the  parties decide which majority to form.    [Occhetto] No, I refuse this proportional reasoning. I would  rather say that there is a progressive, center, and right bloc,  and it would therefore be desirable for one of these to win the  elections and govern.    [Paci] But if none of the three wins...    [Occhetto] Then we will make a responsible commitment to  find  the forces that can implement a recovery program, not a program  of the Left, in parliament. At that point we should all  reexamine ourselves, even myself.    [Paci] And the premier of such a nonleft recovery program,  would be Ciampi.    [Occhetto] I respect Ciampi who has said that he places  himself above the parties, even mine, and I consider him a  reserve for democracy.</p>

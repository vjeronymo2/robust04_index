			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SCHOOLS PANEL URGES ROOM AIR CONDITIONERS;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: IN THE EFFORT TO COOL YEAR-ROUND CLASSROOMS, WINDOW UNITS ARE  CONSIDERED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO MORE EXPENSIVE CENTRAL COOLING.  </P> <P> A Los Angeles school board committee recommended Thursday installing window air  conditioners at a handful of San Fernando Valley schools to see if the units  will provide a low-cost alternative to central air-conditioning, which would  cost an estimated $675 million to install at campuses citywide.  </P> <P> The pilot program -- which must be approved by the full school board -- could  reduce air-conditioning costs by more than two-thirds, said Julie Crum,  assistant director of maintenance for the Los Angeles Unified School District.  </P> <P> Officials estimate that it will cost about $90 million to install central  air-conditioning at 61 year-round schools in the Valley, the area identified as  having the highest temperatures in the city. Installing window air conditioners  would cost an estimated $25 million.  </P> <P> "The question is whether the window units will be too noisy and whether they  can cool off a room with 30 warm bodies," Crum said.  </P> <P> The school board's building committee also agreed to apply for $30 million of  the $45 million in state bond money approved by voters in June to pay for  air-conditioning year-round schools.  </P> <P> Parents representing schools in the Valley told building committee members that  classrooms this past month have been too hot for their children to learn.  </P> <P> "It is terrible for the kids," agreed school board member Julie Korenstein, who  represents the West Valley.  </P> <P> District officials said it will take several years to install central  air-conditioning at the more than 475 schools that will need such systems when  the entire district converts to year-round scheduling next summer.  </P> <P> The year-round schedules were approved by the board earlier this year to make  more classroom space available in the fast-growing district.  </P> <P> Some board members have suggested the district raise funds for air-conditioning  and other improvements through a local bond measure in the next two years. A  similar measure was narrowly defeated by Beverly Hills voters in June.  </P></p>

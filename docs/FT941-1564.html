			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / International Company News: NTT links with Microsoft in software distribution venture NTT, Japan's largest tele-communications carrier, and Microsoft, the world's leading software house, are co-operating in a novel method for the low-cost distribution of computer software. Some observers believe the venture could result in the two companies eventually working closely on other aspects of multimedia, the delivery of a range of services to the office and the home through telecommunications channels. A spokesperson for Microsoft, however, insisted that the arrangement was not an alliance and no agreements had been signed. The venture is limited only to Japan. The software distribution system is designed to exploit NTT's telecommunications network and expertise in software encryption, together with Microsoft's software skills. The idea is that Microsoft programs will be distributed cheaply on CD-Rom disks, which can be read by a suitably equipped personal computer. The information will be in an encrypted or coded form. Part of the program, however, will not be coded and can be inspected by a prospective customer. If the customer is satisfied with the program, they will be able to license the entire software package by downloading a decryption key over the telephone network. The plan is that NTT will profit from the use of its network, its encryption system and its payment collection methods, while Microsoft will benefit by distributing and licensing its software to a wider audience. Eventually, the two companies hope to develop a system where customers will be able to download software of their choice directly through the network, rather like the 'video-on-demand' services now being tested.</p>

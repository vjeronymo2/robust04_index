			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev, 16 Apr -- After returning from the Moscow  meeting of CIS countries' heads of states and governments,  Leonid Kravchuk, Ukraine's president, gave a news conference at  the Kiev's Borispol airport.    [Begin recording] [Kravchuk] Black Sea Fleet problems were  at  the center of attention, but the meeting between the presidents  of Ukraine and Russia, in which the prime ministers, foreign  affairs ministers, and defense ministers of both states took  part, was of a broader nature. The meeting took the form of a  discussion of large scale problems. In particular, we agreed  and instructed the foreign affairs ministers to prepare a  wide-ranging treaty on friendship and cooperation between  Ukraine and Russia. I officially invited the president of  Russia to pay a state visit to Ukraine and he accepted this  invitation.    Economic problems were discussed too, but the Black Sea  Fleet  issue was the central one. It has made our relations more acute  and could make them more acute in the future. It seems to me  that at this stage, we have adopted the only possible and  sensible decision -- we acknowledged that we should divide in  accordance with the Yalta, Zavidovo, and Massandra meetings.  That is, Ukraine takes its share of the fleet, and that part  which it does not take, it gives away, sells, or transfers to  Russia according to its value, which will be determined by the  competent experts.    Toward the end, we clearly determined the parameters of what  part of the fleet Ukraine is taking: as much as it can maintain  and as much as its strategic concept and defense doctrine  demand. We proceeded from our strategic aims -- how many  fighting ships and personnel in service afloat [plavsklad] we  need. An instruction was issued that all the parameters  connected with basing the Russian fleet in Ukraine be elaborated  within 10 days. The Russian fleet's base will be determined not  in general terms, but on universally acknowledged international  principles, and this base will be leased accordingly on certain  conditions, which are universally acknowledged in the world.    We came to the conclusion that we should clarify the Odessa  incident, which could cause a chain reaction. The defense  ministers of Ukraine and Russia were instructed to pass the  directives of the two presidents to Eduard Baltin, commander of  the Black Sea Fleet, and to Volodymyr Bezkorovaynyy, commander  of Ukraine's Navy, so that they take all the necessary measures  so as not to let those processes develop, which complicate or  could complicate the situation at the current points where the  fleet is based.    [Correspondent] Over 20 documents were signed at the Moscow  sitting. Did Ukraine make any proposals or observations?    [Kravchuk] We signed all of the documents pertaining to the  economic situation without exception. Now the issue of an  associate or actual member of the association means not only  closer economic integration, but that political integration will  necessarily occur following it. Others are to be found  corresponding to our level -- an associate member. But now all  are signing the same documents, and the same laws are in force  for all. There is no need to make a tragedy of this. This is a  process of formation. Europe was going towards a European union  for 35 years. We cannot do in five years what Europe did in 35.  The main thing is that the general tendency is going towards  economic integration, and here Ukraine is not throwing anything  out, but is going towards and will be going towards this  integration, because this is an objective and natural process,  which meets the interests of the people.    [Correspondent] Does the fact that the fleet will be divided  so 80 percent goes to Russia and 20 percent to Ukraine  correspond to reality? Will Russia's naval bases be on our  territory, and if so then on what conditions and what will their  status be?    [Kravchuk] I have already said that Ukraine will take for  itself as many fighting ships and as much infrastructure as it  needs to secure its military strategic aims in accordance with  the military doctrine, which has been approved. According to  our calculations, we need approximately 15-20 percent. We  already have a part of our ships, and we have border guard  vessels too. This is not about Russia's military bases, but  about one military base for the Russian fleet. Ten days have  been given so that the delegations, taking into account  interests and possibilities, determine where this base will be  located. This cannot be a subjective decision so that when we  begin to implement it later, we see that it is not open to  implementation. Everyone says that the Russian fleet's base  should not be in Sevastopol. From patriotic considerations this  does not cause any doubt. But let us look at the situation,  which has now arisen. There is now a fleet, and the greater  part of this fleet will belong to Russia. Tens of officers and  their families live in Sevastopol, their children are in  kindergarten. Now they suddenly say, let us make it so that the  Russian fleet leaves Sevastopol. This is possible, but we  should say, as for example Germany says, that the Russian troops  should leave Germany, and for that we give you German marks,  build accommodation for you, and you resettle. But we can say  (this will be approximately 120,000 people): You leave  Sevastopol, move somewhere, we will not offer you flats,  schools, or kindergartens. So what answer will these people  give? That is, one should not adopt a decision while being  guided only by emotions and desires. All the more so when it is  not being adopted forever -- a lease has a time-scale -- and  there is no need to dramatize the situation. This is politics,  and the masses take part in politics, and in this case thousands  of people make up the masses. And no one can disregard the  interests of thousands of people.    [Correspondent] Information from various agencies exists  that the CIS countries agreed to a special status for Russia  regarding implementation of its peacemaking functions?    [Kravchuk] This issue was not discussed. The issue was  discussed and a corresponding statement made about ending the  war in Azerbaijan. The presidents of Azerbaijan and Armenia made  such statements. Ukraine signed it, too. The point is that the  CIS countries took into consideration the presidents' statements  that they will stop or will do everything necessary to stop the  armed conflicts. Then one can begin talks with the  participation of CIS countries' peacemaking forces and in the  presence of CSCE or UN observers. There was no talk about  granting Russia some kind of powers. It is about the  peacemaking forces of the CIS, or more precisely, those  countries, which come under the collective treaty.    [Correspondent] Your attitude to the person of Admiral  Baltin, the Black Sea Fleet commander? Were issues of avoiding  a possible conflict in the very near future discussed?    [Kravchuk] My attitude to the Black Sea Fleet commander  after  his latest action is a negative one. If we, for example, saw  that the process of resolving the Black Sea situation was being  delayed, I would make a specific proposal on the part of Ukraine  and would recall my signature. But as I am convinced that we do  not have the right to delay, then it will not concern me as  president who will be the commander of the Russian fleet. That  will then be Russia's affair. Therefore, I have refrained from  making a corresponding statement up to now and from recalling my  signature. With regard to settling the situation, the presidents  of Russia and Ukraine instructed the defense ministers of both  countries to give orders for settling all of the acute problems  at all base positions and to begin resolving the problems.    [Correspondent] What amounts of compensation can Ukraine  count on when the fleet is divided? When is the visit by  Russia's president expected?    [Kravchuk] It still has to be calculated on defined  principles how much the ships, which will be handed over to  Russia, and the Russian fleet's basing [bazuvannya] will be  worth. How much it comes to all together depends on how much  will be offered. The Russian president's visit will become real  when we have prepared the wide-ranging treaty on friendship and  cooperation between Ukraine and Russia.    [Correspondent] As the economic union envisages that a  fully-fledged member does not have the right to enter another  economic union without permission, will it not be that permanent  and fully-fledged members of the economic union will essentially  be cut off from the European community?    [Kravchuk] There is a certain problematic situation for  (?the  country), but there is also the reality that one is still a long  way from fully-fledged membership of the European Union. In my  opinion, a union as a phenomenon in world politics is a  temporary phenomenon, which leads to the division of the world  into blocs, political groupings, and military interests. If one  is to speak from a broad aspect, the problem is in integrating  unions' bases. I think that society will realize this itself,  and the CIS is uniting into a union because of this too. At  present, we are not reaching beyond the level of all of our  possibilities, which are within the framework of the CIS. One  should live according to one's means.    With regard to dividing the Black Sea Fleet, 50 percent each  way, -- this has already been divided, we agreed to this both in  Yalta and in Zavidovo. Now they are 50 percent of ours. I am  not going to name precise figures. We take 400 ships (200 of  ours and 200 Russian ones). This has already been divided. Of  our 200, we need 20 percent, and those which we do not need, we  sell to Russia according to the value in the appraisal, which  will have been made.    [Correspondent] A political evaluation of the consequences  of the elections in Ukraine has not been heard from you yet. A  congress of the Ukrainian Union of Industrialists and  Entrepreneurs has taken place, where Leonid Kuchma was proposed  as the candidate for president. Tomorrow Rukh will surely  propose Vyacheslav Chornovil. What is your attitude to yourself  as a future candidate for president?    [Kravchuk] I proceed from the fact that there is a law "On  Elections of a President" and that people propose their  candidacies in accordance with this law. This is the right of  everyone and of those people who have proposed a candidate for  president. This is a normal process. It is important for me  that the president's status be clearly defined. One can elect a  president with the current status too, that is elect a president  as head of state and head of executive authority, which is noted  in the Constitution. I understand that if elections of a  president take place and changes are not made to the  constitution -- and I do not think that this will be very easy  for 338 deputies to do -- that the president is only a head of  state. Then the following collision will arise: At the same  time as elections of a president, bodies of power are elected,  the structure of which does not envisage a president with  executive functions. That is, a president is elected as head of  executive power, but the functions and possibilities for  executing one's powers are taken away. As I understand it, the  councils do not envisage a president with executive powers. A  president could be elected who will not have anything or anyone  to direct, but then in order to take away his executive powers  again, the tug of war will begin again. He can ask for a  referendum or the people will agree to leave him the functions  of head of state and head of executive power, and if the people  agree to this in a referendum, then it will be necessary to  create presidential structures again. It will end where it began.    The main problem in elections of a parliament is the winning  over of non-party deputies, who are 51 or 52 percent of those  elected. Who will manage to get them on their side? It is too  soon to make predictions at the moment, as not all deputies have  been elected yet. [end recording]</p>

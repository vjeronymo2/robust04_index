			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yim Sang-chol, doctor of agriculture, professor </F> at the College of Agriculture, Sangji University: "Is It  Possible To Breathe Life Into North Korea's Agriculture?"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted]  <H5>  North Korea's Agricultural Policy </H5>   North Korea's agricultural policy may be described very  briefly as follows:    North Korea launched a sweeping land reform program in March  1946 under the principle of confiscation without compensation  and free distribution, thereby eliminating the landlord class  and paving the way for agricultural collectivization in the  countryside.    Agricultural collectivization began in 1954 and was  completed in 1958. In this period more than 3,800 large-scale  agricultural cooperatives were organized, resulting in the  complete elimination of the private ownership of land and means  of agricultural production. In this process 94 percent of the  land was converted into cooperative ownership and the remaining  6 percent into state ownership. North Korea published what they  call "the Thesis on the Socialist Agrarian Question [in Our  Country]" in February 1964," setting as the basic goal of its  agricultural policy to convert cooperative ownership in  agriculture to "ownership by all the people" .    North Korea pushed "four-conversions," namely, rural  irrigation, electrification, mechanization, and  chemicalization, as a basic task for the immediate goal of  eliminating the gaps between agricultural and industrial labor,  between urban and rural areas, and between farmers and workers.  As a means of conversion to state ownership, North Korea  selected areas suitable for collectivization and converted them  into state-run firms, while expanding existing state firms and  ranches developed as major agricultural estates producing  speciality crops, fruit, and livestock, and creating more of  the similar firms and ranches. A great deal of investment was  made in these state firms on a priority basis. With emphasis on  four rural conversions, North Korea introduced the so-called  "chuche farming method" beginning in the late 1970's, calling  for the chucheization, scientization, and modernization of  agriculture. On the other hand, it implemented a five-point  grand nature harnessing program with dry-field irrigation,  terraced field development, antierosion work, and marsh-land  reclamation as its principal content.  <H5>  Present State of North Korea's Agriculture </H5> That was a brief overview of North Korea's agricultural policy  for the past half century. North Korea has pursued its  agriculture-first policy as part of socialist construction and  implemented an agricultural policy of its own. However, the  present condition of North Korea's agriculture is unmistakably  in bad shape. This may be because forced labor cannot but be  unproductive where the principle of market economy is brushed  aside, a common phenomenon and weakness of socialism. The 21st  Plenum of the Sixth Workers Party of Korea [WPK] Central  Committee set aside the next three years until 1996 as a buffer  period in socialist economic construction during which the  first priority would be given to agriculture, light industry,  and trade. This may be construed as signifying that North Korea  is also applying the principle of adaptation, the principle  that no nation should remain left behind the worldwide trend to  break away from irrationality and swim with internationalism.    The following is a brief examination of the merits and  demerits of North Korea's major agricultural policies.    First, as far as North Korea is concerned, the land reform  policy and the policy of collectivizing agricultural production  may be viewed as a considerable success. Supposing economies of  scale are applicable in the communist system as in the  democratic system, the policy of collectivization may be viewed  as a successful one in that is clearly conducive to the  effective utilization of land. Rearrangement of arable land and  collectivization, which North Korea considered indispensable as  a prerequisite to increased soil productivity and agricultural  mechanization, served as the foundation of mechanization. Let  us compare this with the situation in the South. In the South it  is next to impossible to carry out a bold rearrangement of  arable land for these reasons: Different people own different  pieces of land, different farmers use different farming methods  and grow different crops, and there are numerous other problems  such as those involving compensation. In North Korea on the  other hand, it seems that they could complete the rearrangement  of arable land without much difficulty under complete planning.    Second, four conversions refers to the four tasks aimed at  what they call the scientization of the rural economy in North  Korean, namely, irrigation, electrification, mechanization, and  chemicalization.    By rural irrigation is meant building irrigation facilities  on arable land. In North Korea almost all paddy fields and over  50 percent of dry fields are under irrigation. This indicates  that North Korea has pursued irrigation as the first priority  task in the development of rural communities.    The electrification policy bore a considerable fruit in the  early stage. However, the current record shows meager success  as is the case in other industrial sectors, due to the gaping  disparity between the ever-growing demand for energy and the  current pace of growth in electricity production. Mechanization  was essential to farm work in large collective farms.  Particularly because it was pursued in conjunction with the  munitions industry, the mechanization policy had much that  warranted its seeming justification. However, in our judgment  the policy has been ineffectual because of frequent mechanical  failures resulting from the backwardness of the technologies  used, as well as the low operating rates resulting from the  energy shortage and the lack of enthusiasm to work.    With emphasis on chemicalization, North Korea has rapidly  increased the use of fertilizers while gradually increasing the  amount of agricultural chemicals sprayed in order to increase  the per unit output. Agricultural chemicals and fertilizers are  double-edged swords: When used properly, they are tonic to  plants, but their overdose can be poisonous. Reportedly, all  arable land in North Korea has become acidified due to the  policy of chemicalization, causing a decline in agricultural  productivity contrary to their expectations.    Third, North Korea's grand nature harnessing policy is aimed  at expanding the acreage of land under cultivation. Seeing the  necessity of expanding arable land as the first requisite for  increased agricultural production, North Korea adopted and  implemented the "five-point policy for the grand nature  harnessing," namely, dry-field irrigation construction,  terraced dry-field construction, land rearrangement and soil  amelioration, anti-erosion projects, and marsh land  reclamation. Despite its effects in increasing the acreage of  land under cultivation, this policy may be viewed as typical of  failed agricultural policies. To expand the acreage of arable  land which was absolutely in short supply, North Korea  reclaimed all mountain slopes and converted them into terraced  fields while converting all land that could be irrigated into  paddy fields. As a consequence, forests have been devastated  and soil has been washed away so much that the level of the  river bottom has risen, increasing the frequency of floods and  causing severe flood damage to the crops. Apparently, this is an  outcome of the irrational policy under which in defiance of  common sense dictating that a mountain is where trees grow and  a paddy or dry field is where crops grow, they cut trees to  plant crops and call the patches of land thus created paddies  and fields.    Fourth, the policy of self-reliance is based on the  socialist  spirit of attaining self-sufficiency in food and clothing. It  may be aimed at achieving a self-sufficient economy through the  socialization of agriculture and the attainment of  self-sufficiency in food and clothing on the basis of the  chuche ideology. But clearly, the outcome of such policy has  been fully demonstrated in the former Soviet Union, China, and  communist Vietnam. Abandoning their self-pride, these  countries have made their debut on the international economic  stage and are now taking an active role among the ranks of free  trade and international cooperation to achieve leaping  progress. But in an attempt to increase agricultural efficiency  for their much-touted purpose of "building an earthly  paradise," North Korea alone is still resorting to such  desperate measures as an all-out mobilization of  non-agricultural labor, including clerical employees of  factories and enterprises, industrial workers, students, and  soldiers, in farming during the busy season. The pursuit of an  arbitrary ineffectual agricultural policy based on what they  call the chuche farming method, contrary to its original goal  of breaking the existing impasse by giving hope to the class of  disgruntled farmers and presenting bright prospects, has proven  unsuccessful so far in achieving the food production goal, with  agricultural productivity remaining very low. It is impossible  to make an accurate assessment of the food production and  supply situation in North Korea because of the unavailability  of credible statistics. It is speculated that thanks to its  agriculture-first policy, North Korea exceeds South Korea in  terms of the self-sufficiency rate in food grain supply.  However, compared with South Korea, the variety of foodstuffs  supplied in North Korea is limited and particularly their  quality is very poor. This may be attributable to the limits of  the controlled economy under which the farmers are coerced to  achieve the government-imposed numerical production goals in the  absence of incentives for stimulating their desire to produce.  Up till now our analysts have made pretty much the same  comparisons between the relative economic strength of the North  and South by toying with scanty, piece-meal statistics  available. Comparisons in agricultural production were no  exception. They often made their comparisons by using figures  on the output of the staple grain alone as the basis of their  argument. That is why North Korea overexaggerated the output of  staple grain by including corn, potatoes, and so on in this  category besides rice. [passage omitted]  <H5>  Future Prospects </H5>   In his New Year's message this year, Kim Il-song said: "In  the domain of the rural economy, we triumphantly executed the  grand nature harnessing program designed to bring irrigation to  a high degree of completion, effected a turnaround in  mechanization and chemicalization, and further developed  agricultural science and technology to suit the demands of the  chuche farming method, thereby laying a solid foundation for an  agricultural revolution that will assure a continual bumper  crop for ages to come." He added: "We must bring about a new  turn in the development of the rural economy by waging a  vigorous struggle to complete the historic tasks outlined in  the Theses on the Agrarian Question. We must consolidate our  successes in rural irrigation and electrification, achieve a  high degree of planning and scientization, and thoroughly  implement the chuche farming method so that we may increase the  rice yield and develop all other sectors of agricultural  production still more. Our working class must produce a greater  variety of farm machinery and materials, such as tractors and  trucks, modern farm machines, chemical fertilizers, and  agricultural chemicals in greater quantities and deliver them to  our rural villages. Cooperative farmers and all agricultural  workers must fulfill the party-assigned goals of  self-sufficiency by doing their farm work meticulously and  assiduously."    As you see, North Korea still resorts pretty much to  agitating language, but we can hardly see any signs of change  in North Korea. Nevertheless, their emphasis on agriculture to  achieve self-sufficiency, the importance attached to heavy  industry [as published] to achieve qualitative and quantitative  improvements in the production of daily necessities, their  professed desire to increase exports by actively searching out  and mobilizing resources for producing exportable goods and  develop processing trade--all this may have stemmed from their  judgment that the situation is so urgent that they have no  choice but to change in one way or another in this age of  internationalization. Supposing that assumption is in the realm  of possibility to a certain extent, the question is: Whom will  North Korea choose as its major partner? Japan, which is  extending its hand in a more forthcoming manner than any among  free countries, is one possible candidate. There is much  possibility that North Korea will seek active relationships  with other countries. But North Korea should know that the most  reliable, stable, and profitable partnership can be obtained  through the blood relationship between the North and South.    Should North Korea's agricultural administration boldly  approve of private ownership of arable land, it would stimulate  the desire of the farmers to produce more and spur the  development of agricultural technology suitable to the  topographic and climatic conditions in North Korea; and this  would enable North Korea to produce more from its land that  would be neatly rearranged, and thus resolve the food shortage  without difficulty.    Unless the current system is boldly revamped, the farmers'  desire to produce cannot but be passive and lukewarm and their  productivity will fall more and more with each passing day,  resulting in a slack and decline in yield in every category of  cultivation.

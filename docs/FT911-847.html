			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Hopes are high for a joint venture ELF Enterprise Petroleum, the joint venture company set up to buy Occidental's UK oil and gas assets, will be a leading player in the North Sea. It will have estimated reserves of 300m barrels of oil and production is expected to peak at 100,000 barrels a day (b/d) in 1995, writes Deborah Hargreaves. It is a smart, strategic step for Elf, which has been energetically pursued by its chairman, Mr Loik Le Floch-Prigent. The deal satisfies the company's aim to become a leading operator in the UK. But Elf is paying a full price for its North Sea ambitions. The deal values Enterprise's Nelson interest at more than Pounds 600m as part of an overall agreement which will pay Dollars 4.50 to Dollars 5 a barrel for proven oil reserves. This values Occidental's assets higher than most analysts had predicted: they had put the price at Dollars 1.1bn (Pounds 651m), Dollars 250m less than the joint venture is paying. 'This underpins the value of the industry sub-sector,' said Mr Fergus McLeod, oil analyst at County NatWest in Edinburgh. The deal will boost Enterprise's production profile just when it begins to sag in 1993 by adding an additional 25,000 b/d to output as some of Occidental's assets come on stream. It will also speed up cash flow to the company if the new venture makes a profit in three years, as the companies expect. The deal prompted the City to raise its earnings forecasts for Enterprise next year by about 5 per cent to 42.5 pence a share. Initially, it also reflected well on the share price which rose to 570p. However, shares dropped back to close at 556p, slightly below Tuesday's level. A big benefit for the UK independent oil group is that the deal removes a potential predator. The presence of the Elf stake has cast a cloud over the company's shares for months. Elf has said it will retain its 10.1 per cent stake in Enterprise as an investment, and the French company must consult its British partner if it decides to sell. But Enterprise also stressed yesterday that it had an escape clause allowing it to leave the joint venture within 90 days at any time. The clause has prompted some analysts to question how long the marriage of convenience may last.</p>

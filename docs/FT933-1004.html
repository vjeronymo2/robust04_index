			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Survey of Residential Property (10): A hint of a smile in the Nordic markets - There is increasing foreign interest in home-buying in Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland / International FOR THE first time in three years, estate agents in Stockholm are starting to smile. Like those in the UK, they did well from the late 1980s when housing prices climbed 50 per cent or more, but the 1990s have proved wretched, with prices falling by at least 30 per cent and turnover slowing sharply. Now, the market once again looks at a turning point, with clear signs of a recovery over the traditionally quiet summer months. 'Things have been a lot busier since June,' says Thomas Vetterli, a broker with Mats Holmgren, one of Stockholm's leading real estate companies; to make his point, he noted that he had been forced to shorten his annual holiday by two weeks to cope with the upsurge. Agents elsewhere in Sweden also point to an improvement in sentiment, although most speak of a patchy recovery and are wary of pronouncing the recession over just yet. What goes for Sweden goes, in general terms, for the rest of the Nordic region. House prices across all the countries in the area - Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland - have fallen sharply during the 1990s, mainly because of recession and sky-high mortgage rates. Now they have fallen sharply, some of the accumulated pent-up demand has been unleashed; in Sweden, for example, mortgages can be had for 9.75 per cent, a 17-year low. In oil-rich Norway, which has a stronger economy and less unemployment than either Sweden or Finland, the housing market is now in a firm recovery phase. But this follows a five-year-long recession during which prices in the Oslo area fell by 40 per cent. And the market in Finland, which has the regions's most serious structural economic problems and unemployment of more than 20 per cent, remains very depressed. The surge in Swedish buyer interest is so new that prices have yet to move up sharply. In any case, it is apparent that purchasers are being very cautious and more selective. So far, only condominiums - flats bought in apartment blocks - are showing signs of recovery. Even there, potential buyers are worrying about maintenance charges. One reason is that the cash-strapped government intends to scale back housing subsidies sharply over the next decade, causing a shortfall that will have to be made up by owners. 'Buyers are very concerned if there are plans to renovate the block because this leads to a higher monthly charge. It explains why people are very anxious to look into the balance sheet of the property before they buy,' says Alf Midby, who owns a company specialising in more exclusive properties. Buyers are also proving wary about villas, although this is because property taxes on houses are higher than on flats. Average prices for villas in Sweden now lie at around SKr500,000 (Pounds 41,300), although the figure in the Stockholm area is SKr884,000. At Midby's end of the market prices have fallen by an average of 30 per cent in the past three years, but he stresses there have been wide variations depending on location and quality. A villa in the capital's smart Stocksund suburb was sold for SKr8.8m in November 1990, but the purchasers got barely half that when they sold it this summer for SKr4.5m. Recovery in the housing market is likely to be slow, in any case, because of Sweden's overall economic condition. Although exports are rising, the domestic economy remains very depressed. Unemployment, already 13 per cent, could reach 16-18 per cent next year and private consumption is still falling. Like Britain, there is also the problem of negative equity - those saddled with a mortgage which is higher than the value of their property. In the greater Stockholm area, an estimated 22 per cent of owners - broadly, those who bought between 1987 and 1992 - are believed to be caught in this trap. In 1991, the figure was just 2 per cent. For Sweden as a whole, the rate is 10 per cent. Increased interest from foreign buyers is helping; indeed, Holmgren supplies a contract drawn up in English or German, something it has only started doing in the last year. To many, this is surprising because there has never been a big foreign demand for Swedish property. The legal restrictions placed on housing sales to foreigners has been part of the cause. Then again, Stockholm has, traditionally, been one of Europe's most expensive cities, lacking the cosmopolitan charms of London or Paris. Even with the summer cottage market, the Swedish climate has proved a big deterrent. The situation has changed over the past year for two reasons. First, many of the restrictions on foreigners buying Swedish property were abolished at the start of the year. Second, there has been a huge devaluation of the krona since Sweden floated its currency last November. Foreigners now see a chance to buy cheaply before the market recovers. The interest is coming particularly from foreigners with Swedish relatives, businessmen and embassies. There are also rich Swedes living abroad - people who did well from the last property boom and moved abroad to avoid tax but now believe the market offers good value again. Swedes and Finns remain sensitive over foreign purchases of their summer cottages, and it has become an issue in their talks on joining the European Community. In particular, they worry that the Germans, exploiting the strong D-mark, will snap up their cherished stugas - which often lie deep in the forest or on the coast - and price locals out of the market. For the moment, this fear probably is overdone, although there are reports that sales to foreigners of summer properties in southern Sweden have risen by 42 per cent in the past year. Parts of southern Sweden are just three hours away by ferry from northern Germany. In any case, the Swedes are keeping some restrictions. Foreigners without Swedish connections, and who cannot meet certain residence requirements, still have to get a special permit to buy a property 'for recreation.' In most cases, this is just a formality; but, in certain areas, applications can be refused in the interests of taming demand and stopping prices from rising beyond the reach of local people.</p>

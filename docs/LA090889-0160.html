			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> GORBACHEV WRITES TO POPE, SUGGESTS MEETING DURING UPCOMING ITALY VISIT  </P> <P> Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev has written to Pope John Paul II to express  his interest in meeting the pontiff for a full review of Vatican-Soviet  relations, a Vatican official said today.  </P> <P> In Moscow, Soviet sources said Gorbachev is expected to visit Italy on Nov. 25.  </P> <P> A meeting between Gorbachev and the Polish-born Pope has been viewed as likely  during the Soviet leader's stop in Italy, but there had been no confirmation by  either side.  </P> <P> Such a meeting would be of historic proportions, the first between the head of  a Soviet Communist Party that disparages religion and the leader of the world's  850 million Roman Catholics.  </P></p>

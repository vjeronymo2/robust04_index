			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED ON MOSQUE DESIGN  </P> <P> I could not believe that the political powers have nothing better to occupy  their taxpayer-financed energy output than to limit the roof lines of a Muslim  mosque to straight lines instead of the traditional dome shape to maintain the  "look of the neighborhood."  </P> <P> Shall we, who have bumps on our noses, have them straightened to maintain an  "American" look or some such thing? Why do we continue to insult our own  intelligence by electing and appointing such misguided idiots as the ones who  issued this biased edict?  </P> <P> MIKHAEL KOLLANDER  </P> <P> Canoga Park  </P></p>

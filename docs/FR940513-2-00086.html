			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Such a synthesis may take various forms. An applicant may synthesize exemplary products as produced_or change the form of the product to maximize utilization. Creative adaptations may be needed. A compilation of relevant demonstration or research results  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (and/or recommendations) from the cluster may be what is needed. Applicants are encouraged to be innovative in their response to this priority area. The need for the synthesis should be demonstrated. A strategy for promoting utilization must be included as part of the application. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicants proposing to synthesize the results of clusters of past projects must submit a general description of the past projects and their outcomes not to exceed five (5) pages in length. This cluster description should be in the form of an  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> attachment <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  which is in addition to the page limit which applies to all applications. However, the application narrative itself may not exceed the limits described below in Part III. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applications of either of the types described above should carefully specify not only what dissemination activities are to be performed but also: (1) Why the product(s) is important, (2) to whom it is important, (3) what would be the results and benefits of dissemination and utilization of the product(s), and (4) what specific actions such as training or technical assistance would the proposed project undertake to assist those who wish to adapt or adopt the products and/or the recommendations contained in the products. Prospective applicants are cautioned that this priority area may not be used simply to finish or extend the basic work of a previously funded project (under the guise of dissemination) or to undertake the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> basic <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  dissemination which is required as part of the work plan of all Title IV grantees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In preparing applications under this priority area, applicants may find useful the publication  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Dissemination by Design <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  which was produced as part of an AoA Title IV project. Interested applicants who do not already have a copy of this publication may obtain one by contacting AoA's Office of Program Development (OPD) at (202) 619&hyph;0441. (There is no requirement to use this particular reference in the development of your application.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicants may also request an information sheet on the AoA-supported National Aging Dissemination Center, which works with AoA to promote dissemination of the products of Title IV grantees. The Center is available to provide technical assistance on dissemination and utilization to prospective applicants under this priority area. Prospective applicants are encouraged to utilize this resource. The Director of the Center is Theresa Lambert. She can be reached at (202) 898&hyph;2578. Projects funded under this priority area will be expected to work cooperatively with the Dissemination Center or any similar resource to be established in the future. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicants under this priority area are limited to current and former Title IV grantees and cooperative agreement awardees. AoA expects to fund approximately five (5) dissemination projects under this priority area. The federal share of awards will range from approximately $25,000 to $50,000, depending upon the level of activity proposed, for a project period of approximately seventeen (17) months. The  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> deadline date <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for submitting applications under this priority area is  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> July 12, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> 5.5&blank;Field-Initiated Project Applications <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Older Americans Act, Title IV, Section 401, authorizes the Assistant Secretary for Aging to support projects: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=3 --> To expand the Nation's knowledge and understanding of aging and the aging process, to design and test innovative ideas in programs and services for older individuals, and publicly disseminate the results of [such innovative projects], to replicate such programs and services under [the Older Americans Act], and to help meet the needs for trained personnel in the field of aging.&blank;.&blank;.&blank;. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Each of the priority areas that has been presented in this Discretionary Funds Program (DFP) Announcement is focused on a subject of current or emerging significance to our nation's older population. These priority areas describe with some particularity the nature of the activity to be undertaken, the type, scope, duration, and funding amount of the project and, in some instances, the applicants eligible to compete. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under this priority area for Field-Initiated Project Applications, the focus remains on issues that matter greatly to older people, but not necessarily those issue areas (home and community based long term care, older women, etc.) that have already received considerable emphasis in this DFP. This priority area is intended for proposed project initiatives that reflect a deep-seated interest in any policy, program, or related issue of importance to older Americans. In a similar vein, the Administration on Aging fully recognizes, that there are many creative ideas, innovative approaches, training/technical assistance/dissemination efforts, etc., which do not readily fit the designated Priority Areas of this Discretionary Funds Program Announcement. This priority area is also intended to be responsive to proposals embodying those ideas, approaches, and efforts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Field-initiated applications for new grant awards <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  are invited under the following functional sub-categories: (1) Special event/conference proposals; (2) research and demonstration (R&amp;D) projects, and; (3) education, training, and technical assistance efforts. Current AoA grantees seeking large-scale supplemental awards (supplements that would exceed 25% of their current project award and/or extend their project period beyond three months) must also compete under this priority area to be eligible for funding. To ensure that to the maximum extent possible competition will be between proposals of a comparable scope and nature of activity, applications will be grouped according to the appropriate sub-category and be evaluated, scored, and ranked within each of these subcategories: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) special event/conference proposals; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) research and demonstration (R&amp;D) projects; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) education, training, and technical assistance efforts, and; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) large-scale supplements to currently active AoA funded project grants (supplements that would exceed 25% of their current project award and/or extend their project period beyond three months). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicants are reminded that they are competing under a national program of gerontological training, research, demonstrations, and centers as authorized by Title IV of the Older Americans Act. Therefore, field-initiated applications will be screened by AoA to assure that they are not local service projects, but rather are responsive to issues of national significance and will result in findings, reports, and products with national implications. In addition, each field-initiated application will be screened to determine that it is not, in essence, the same application that was recently disapproved by AoA for funding. Applicants should wait a minimum of six months before resubmitting an application for consideration under another review and award cycle. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AoA has established deadlines at fixed Fiscal Year quarterly intervals for the submission of field-initiated applications under this Discretionary Funds Program Announcement. The first deadline is  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> October 7, 1994 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Subsequent deadlines are  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> January 13, 1995, April 14, 1995 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> July 14, 1995. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Applicants will be informed of their funding status within 60 days of the pertinent deadline date. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the number of field-initiated proposals approved for funding can not be estimated beforehand, applicants should be advised that only a limited amount of Title IV funds will be reserved for this priority area and only applications of outstanding merit will be considered for funding. The federal share of project costs per year is expected to fall within the following approximate ranges: $20,000 to $40,000 for special events/conferences; $50,000 to $100,000 depending upon the nature of the proposed research, demonstration, training, technical assistance, or related effort; $50,000 and above for  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> large-scale supplements <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to current grants. The duration of new project awards could range from one (1) to two (2) years. Large scale supplements are limited to a maximum period of twelve (12) months. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

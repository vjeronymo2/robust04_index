			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Ivan Novikov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 15 Feb -- The main aim of Russian diplomacy  at the present stage of efforts to settle the conflict in former  Yugoslavia is to forestall the possibility that the warring  sides' positions around Sarajevo might be bombed. Vladimir  Ivanovskiy, a Russian Foreign Ministry representative, said this  today at parliamentary hearings, which the State Duma's  committee on geopolitical issues is holding. He accused both  Serbs and Muslims of committing genocide against their own  people, stressing that the aim of Russian diplomacy is to  actively "encourage the use of political means to settle the  conflict."    At the same time Vladimir Ivanovskiy described suggestions  that peacekeeping forces should be pulled out of former  Yugoslavia as "premature." He stressed that Russian diplomatic  efforts were directed at achieving a single approach to the way  that all interested parties -- Russia, the United States, and  the European states -- view a political resolution of the  conflict.</p>

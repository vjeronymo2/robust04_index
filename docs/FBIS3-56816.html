I express condolences to the Azerbaijani people and to the  families, kin, and relatives of our sons and daughters who  attained immortality in the struggle for our freedom, and in our  sorrowful days I call on all of them to unite in the name of our  martyrs.    Today we must stand up for our salvation and the purity of  our spiritual world, and we have to embrace our faith and look  to the future to save ourselves from the quagmire of tragic  incidents.    In their appeals to me as president, martyrs' families and  all the citizens of Azerbaijan ask for the speedy restoration of  morality and justice.    I swear upon all our martyred sons, who have turned this  country into a sacred homeland, and upon the unwavering dignity  of our gloomy-eyed elderly mothers and sisters: Rest assured,  we will stop the calamity and disaster that have befallen our  homeland, which is now overcast by dark clouds. O, rise my  sacred people!    [Signed] Geydar Aliyev</p>

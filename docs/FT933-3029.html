			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Congress Republicans set out health plans REPUBLICANS in the US Congress yesterday produced their proposals for health care reform, pre-empting the formal announcement of President Bill Clinton's plan by a week. But the reform plans, announced separately by Republicans in the Senate and the House of Representatives, differ almost as much from each other as they do from Mr Clinton's blueprint, and both groups said they were willing to work with the administration. On the Senate side, a Republican task force led by Senator John Chafee of Rhode Island laid out a proposal intended to phase in universal health coverage by the turn of the century and to slow the growth of medical costs. Mr Chafee said his plan would set up a standard healthcare benefits package, to be established by a national commission, and would create healthcare purchasing co-operatives. These co-operatives, however, would be voluntary, unlike the Clinton proposal for 'regional health alliances,' which would require everyone in their geographical area to enrol, except for companies with more than 5,000 employees. The plan would aim to cut the annual rate of growth in government spending on its existing Medicare and Medicaid programmes, which provide health coverage to the elderly and the poor, respectively, to 7 per cent, compared with 12 per cent today. Senator Kit Bond, another of the architects of the plan, said it would make health insurance premiums tax deductible up to a set limit for individuals, including the self-employed. As savings began to be realised, vouchers could be phased in to help the less well-off buy insurance. While the Republican Senate plan would require everyone to buy health insurance - much as drivers are required to buy car insurance - the Republican House plan would oblige businesses to offer a health plan to their employees. Neither Republican proposal would force employers to pay for the coverage, unlike the Clinton plan, which would require employers to pay 80 per cent of the premiums (although there would be caps for small businesses.) The House Republicans plan for extending health insurance to the estimated 37m people who have none is a tax-free 'Medical Savings Account,' similar to the Independent Retirement Accounts allowing tax-free pension savings. The plan suggests allowing people to keep any unused money from these accounts at the end of the year, so giving people a financial interest in a more economical consumption of medical services. The Republicans have a credibility problem on health care, to judge by opinion polls which show them to be much less trusted than the Democrats by voters on this issue. This may help account for the somewhat tentative offerings yesterday, where both House and Senate Republicans acknowledged that their plans were not the final answer. 'We are not here to criticise the administration's draft,' said Senator Robert Dole, the Republican leader. The administration, meanwhile, sought to allay the fears of the health industry that its efforts to consolidate or share equipment and co-operate on services could run foul of antitrust law. The Justice Department laid out guidelines which clarify the sorts of merger and joint venture that would normally be safe from antitrust challenge. These include hospital mergers where one hospital has fewer than 100 beds, fewer than 40 patients a day and is over five years old; joint ventures to buy expensive equipment, and physician networks with less than 20 per cent of the doctors in any specialist field and any geographical area.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Today, some Croatian opposition parties commented on  the declaration signed in Geneva yesterday. In its public  statement on the joint declaration by the Republic of Croatia  and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the Croatian Social  Liberal Party [HSLS] stresses that there is no justification for  a policy which seeks an ally in an aggressor and an enemy in a  second victim of aggression. The HSLS maintains that the  priority task of Croatia's policy should be an agreement with  the political leadership of Bosnia-Herzegovina's Muslims whereas  the joint statement by Croatia and the Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia will render such an agreement more difficult.    The HSLS believes that relations with the Federal Republic  of  Yugoslavia can be normalized once it has recognized the Croatian  state within its internationally recognized borders, the HSLS  says in its statement. The statement was signed by its  chairman, Drazen Budisa.</p>

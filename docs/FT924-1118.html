			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris tells its own story as senior bourses advance THE recovery on Wall Street, the strength of the dollar and the effect of options and futures expiries were all advanced yesterday as reasons why bourses moved up, writes Our Markets Staff. However, the French told another story. PARIS saw strong overseas institutional interest on the view that the franc will be devalued in the near future. The CAC-40 index closed up 24.89 at 1,760.12. After a volatile week the index was barely changed, while today's turnover was moderate at FFr2.4bn. There was broad support for leading stocks with Bancaire showing one of the day's best performances, mostly due to late buying, as it closed FFr22.9 or 6.5 per cent higher at FFr373.0. Elsewhere Elf rose FFr10 to FFr334, Paribas gained FFr9.70 to FFr349.30, Havas rose FFr18.50 to FFr418.00 and Suez improved FFr8.60 to FFr242.00. Even Carrefour managed a rise of FFr4 to FFr2,206 in spite of reports of a generally depressed French retailing sector, with volume down 10 per cent in November. FRANKFURT was lifted mostly by short-covering linked to the expiry of options and futures contracts, described as seriously illiquid and choppy by one senior DTB trader. The DAX index closed 15.87 higher at 1,492.04, 1.1 per cent higher on the week, as turnover mushroomed to DM10.4bn against DM3.5bn on Thursday. Prominent on the day were Allianz, DM40 higher at DM1,905 and a byword for volatility at times like these; Hoechst, up DM3.40 at DM238 and extending its run of relative strength against BASF and Bayer; and Degussa and Metallgesellschaft, dollar sensitive and cyclical, up DM7.80 to DM330.80 and DM8.50 to DM332.50 respectively. MILAN recovered again, the Comit index ending 5.33 higher at 425.68, to close a week initially depressed by political fears with a rise of 0.7 per cent. News of a higher rate at a key Bank of Italy money market tender took some of the steam out of business. Fiat slipped on the kerb, ending at L3,740, down L60. ZURICH, which had its own options and futures expiry, liked the stronger dollar and the positive trend in early Wall Street trading. The SMI index closed 17.3 higher at 2,046.0, 2.6 per cent higher on the week. UBS bearers topped the active list and rose SFr11 to SFr846. AMSTERDAM went into the weekend on a strong note encouraged by neighbouring markets. The CBS Tendency index closed 0.5 higher at 103.5, a week's gain of 1.1 per cent. DSM lost Fl 1.50 to Fl 70.50 after the group confirmed earlier forecasts of a fall in fourth quarter earnings. MADRID was positive on corporate news with the general index closing 1.92 higher at 215.66, for a 1.5 per cent gain on the week. News that the government is to alter legislation allowing higher rents on properties to be charged lifted the sector, with Metrovacesa gaining Pta185 to Pta2,855 and Vallehermoso up Pta60 at Pta1,325. STOCKHOLM was lifted by lower interest rates, the weaker domestic currency and a buoyant forestry sector. The Affarsvarlden index advanced 27.0 to 900.3, nearly 2 per cent higher on the week, in heavy turnover of SKr1bn after SKr713m. SCA was among the most active stocks, rising SKr19 to SKr116 after an upward revision of its 1992 earnings forecast. OSLO improved following a cut in interest rates and the all-share index closed 3.61 higher at 375.79, a 2.6 per cent fall on the week, in turnover of NKr470m. HELSINKI saw further profit-taking and the Hex index closed 13.9 down at 816.7, down 4.7 per cent on the week. VIENNA continued to weaken with the ATX, down 4.18 at 716.77, setting a new year's low and down 3.5 per cent on the week.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- December 18 THE EUROPEAN SERIES Hourly changes  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          Open    10.30     11.00    12.00 FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1044.50  1046.32   1046.45  1046.86 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1128.16  1130.14   1129.78  1132.71                         13.00    14.00     15.00    Close FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1048.12  1048.43   1050.25  1050.25 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1133.24  1134.02  1 136.11  1136.56  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Dec 17    Dec 16    Dec 15    Dec 14    Dec 11 FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1034.41   1036.62   1038.14   1041.18   1044.03 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1119.02   1117.67   1115.23   1116.33   1117.72  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 - 1050.80; 200 - 1137.74 Low/day: 100 - 1044.30  200 - 1128.16  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

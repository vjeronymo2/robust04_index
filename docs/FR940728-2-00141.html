Since the agency is holding a separate meeting on its research and development programs, any questions on those issues will only be answered at the afternoon meeting to be held on September 13, 1994 from 1:30 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. and should be submitted to the Research and Development Office. However, questions on aspects of the agency's research and development activities that relate to ongoing rulemaking procedures should be submitted, as in the past, to the agency's Rulemaking Office. The meetings will be held at the Ramada Inn, near the Detroit Metro Airport, 8270 Wickman Road, Romulus, MI 48174. The purpose of the meeting is to focus on those phases of NHTSA activities which are technical, interpretative or procedural in nature. Transcripts of the meeting will be available for public inspection in the NHTSA Technical Reference Section in Washington, DC, within four weeks after the meeting. Copies of the transcript will then be available at ten cents a page, (length has varied from 100 to 150 pages) upon request to NHTSA Technical Reference Section, Room 5108, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington DC 20590. The Technical Reference Section is open to the public from 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA will provide auxiliary aids to participants as necessary, during the NHTSA Technical Industry Meeting and the NHTSA Industry Research and Development Meeting.

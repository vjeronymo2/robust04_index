			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report Sentiment on the LME was dampened by the news that IG Metall, the German metals and engineering union, will next Monday decide whether to call a strike ballot. TIN initially maintained its recent advance, with three-month metal rising to a new 18-month high of Dollars 6,100 a tonne before hitting profit-taking. COPPER fell back after three-month metal hit resistance above Dollars 2,240, and finished at Dollars 2,235 a tonne, still up Dollars 3. ZINC drifted back, but remained underpinned by technical tightness - three-month metal held above support around Dollars 1,255 a tonne. The prospect of more origin selling is weighing on both the COFFEE and COCOA markets, London dealers said. London coffee prices were helped by a firmer start in New York, but dealers said the near July contract is still vulnerable to a fall back to Dollars 670 a tonne. Talk that Costa Rica is reducing its exports helped prices, some traders said. But the overall picture remains bearish. London cocoa prices had regained most of the day's earlier losses by the close as recent origin selling appeared to have petered out, but dealers said the market was braced for fresh supplies.

			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / International Company News: Chemicals result pushes Dyno to NKr75m DYNO Industrier, the diversified Norwegian group, yesterday reported a NKr11m increase in first-quarter pre-tax profit to NKr75m (Dollars 11.2m), helped by a strong performance by the chemical division. Dyno outperformed forecasts by domestic analysts, who had predicted pre-tax profit of about NKr55m, but its shares closed NKr4 lower at NKr95 on the Oslo bourse. Group sales rose slightly to NKr1.91bn from NKr1.88bn as operating profit, before financial items, rose by NKr14m to NKr118m. The chemical division lifted first-quarter operating profit by NKr31m to NKr76m, but sales remained unchanged at NKr544m. The explosives division saw operating profit nearly halved to NKr31m from NKr60m, as sales rose by NKr33m to NKr913m. 'The explosives group held steady in North America and Australia, while European activities show a decline following a slump in the building industry,' Dyno explained. The plastics division saw operating profit fall by NKr10m to NKr20 as sales dipped by NKr4m to NKr443m. ***** Hafslund Nycomed, the Norwegian group best-known for its radiology products, yesterday reported a 4 per cent rise in first-quarter pre-tax profit to NKr381m. The improvement, however, was restrained by lower sales in several European markets and government price restrictions on pharmaceuticals. The result was weaker than domestic analysts' forecasts of around NKr405m. On the Oslo bourse yesterday, Hafslund's A shares closed NKr7 lower at NKr143, as B shares plunged by NKr8 to NKr145 and free shares fell by NKr6 to NKr147.50. Group sales, including royalties, rose by NKr126m to NKr1.541bn, as operating expenses increased by NKr175m to NKr873m. Mr Eric Cameron, a Hafslund executive, said the increase in operating expenses resulted from costs associated with the introduction of new products into new markets and from increased purchases of electricity by the energy division to meet higher demand. The capital outlay would be recovered by subsequent electricity sales, he said.</p>

			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / The Markets: Playing ball with Steady Eddie - Global Investor The one thing on which there appears to be complete consensus after the UK Budget last week is that the recent hard-won improvement in the public finances will be thrown away before the next election. It is not just that the record of Mr Kenneth Clarke's predecessors continues to dog him as he vainly protests that there will be no return to boom or bust economics. His overtly political approach to the chancellor's job leaves the impression that he simply itches to bribe the voters with their own money in 12 months' time. A fiscal credibility gap yawns beneath him. Yet if the markets have delivered a lesson in 1994 it is that a consensus tends to form just as the flaws in the argument are about to emerge. The message is reinforced by the thought that Mr Clarke has heard the argument so often that he would be stunningly naive not to aim off for the likely consequences. The greater risk may lie in accident rather than in Machiavellian design. Lord Lawson's mistakes, after all, stemmed largely from a genuine misreading of the economic cycle. Where might the pundits have gone wrong? One obvious potential flaw in the case is that Mr Eddie George, the Governor of the Bank of England, now wields real countervailing power, thanks to the chancellor's own decision to publish the minutes of their regular meetings. Mr George might thus be able to press Mr Clarke into compensating for fiscal laxity with monetary tightening. This would prevent an inflationary boom at the cost of an overvalued exchange rate and a deteriorating current account. We would then have a British version of Reagonomics, in which the Governor filled Mr Paul Volcker's shoes. The difficulty with this is not just that it seems counter-intuitive, historically, to talk of sterling strength when the economy is booming. It would also be asking a great deal of the Governor. He would, of course, justify his actions by reference to inflationary threats rather than fiscal policy as such. Yet he might nonetheless be perceived by many to be undermining the actions of an elected politician and senior member of the cabinet. Even a fully independent central banker would not contemplate that lightly, especially before an election. Would the markets come to his aid by delivering an old-fashioned sterling crisis to create the conditions for more prudent policymaking? It is not difficult to put a case that the British economic recovery is built on unstable financial foundations. With North Sea oil running down, the current account has not been in surplus since 1985, while long-term capital outflows have grown remarkably (see chart). When the current account deficit and the long-term flows are put together in what used to be known as the basic balance, a picture emerges of huge portfolio outflows, financed by short-term inflows. The extent to which British investors have been acting as long-term bankers to the rest of the world becomes apparent in the second chart, which contains the stunning statistic that Britain emerged as a bigger exporter of portfolio capital in 1993 than Japan. The position would have looked even more unstable were it not for the support of US portfolio investors, who raised their purchases of UK equities from Pounds 37bn to Pounds 49bn last year. In short, the chancellor is hostage to foreign financiers to a quite extraordinary degree. How long will he be able to maintain confidence in sterling? Quite possibly for longer than he may deserve, because the figures are improving miraculously. The Treasury is forecasting, not implausibly, that the current account deficit will shrink from Pounds 10.5bn in 1993 to only Pounds 4bn in 1994 and Pounds 3.5bn in 1995. As for long-term capital flows, last year's figures look, with hindsight, increasingly freakish. In the first half of 1994 the net portfolio outflow was transformed into an inflow of Pounds 29bn, chiefly because of repatriation of funds by domestic investors. Yet this, too, looks freakish in the other direction. It is the first time since the last quarter of 1987, which saw the October stock market crash, that UK investors have repatriated funds. The more normal pattern is for long-term outflows to accompany current account deficits. What grounds are there for thinking that the future will be any different? Capital flows are notoriously awkward to predict. But if Britain's increasingly mature pension funds respond to the decline in their cash flow and to new minimum solvency requirements by selling overseas equities in exchange and more boring gilts, the capital account may become more stable. Yet there are some, including Frank Russell, the pension consultants, who argue that UK funds should diversify not less but more overseas, to reduce their 60 per cent over-exposure to a single volatile asset class, UK equities. Then there is the likelihood that US mutual funds will sell UK equities as American investors return funds to the banking system or to higher yielding bonds. Or, again, the possibility that US pension funds, like the big Japanese insurers, will lose their appetite for global diversification. Yet the real joker in the pack may not be sterling but Mr Clarke. If he has concluded that one more boom and bust would finish both him and his party, he might just deliver a well-judged budgetary package that keeps both his fellow Tories and the markets at bay. And he may play ball with Steady Eddie because the ageing of the population has changed the politics of higher interest rates: Ken the pensioner's friend. This is not the consensus wisdom. But the odds on it look consolingly better than the National Lottery.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Total return in local currency to 1/12/94  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                                   % change over period                     US    Japan  Germany   France     Italy      UK  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Cash Week              0.11     0.04     0.09     0.10     0.16     0.10 Month             0.42     0.19     0.41     0.45     0.70     0.48 Year              3.69     1.88     5.31     5.81     8.75     5.13  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 3-5 year Week             -0.40     0.01     0.03     0.28     0.63    -0.26 Month            -0.39     0.89     1.05     1.53     1.37     1.21 Year             -2.84    -1.32     0.86     0.30     4.24    -0.22  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 7-10 year Week              0.31    -0.04    -0.08     0.36     0.66    -0.14 Month             0.18     0.90     1.92     2.95     1.65     1.86 Year             -6.32    -2.92    -3.05    -5.07    -1.15    -4.04  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Equities Week              -0.2      2.6     -0.3      1.4      1.0      0.0 Month             -3.7     -3.4     -0.9      3.2     -1.5     -1.4 Year               0.5      5.6     -3.0     -4.6     18.5     -2.0  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Cash &amp; Bonds - Lehman Brothers.

			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / International Company News: Olivetti expects early lift in Digital stake OLIVETTI, the Italian computers and office equipment group, yesterday said Digital Equipment, the US computers company, is to raise its shareholding ahead of schedule despite the Italian company's bleak financial outlook. Digital will bring forward to May the next step in its three-stage plan to buy almost 10 per cent of Olivetti, agreed last June. The original deal, which saw the US group buying an opening 4.03 per cent of Olivetti when the accord was signed, envisaged that the final tranche would be acquired from the pool of shareholders which control Olivetti by the end of 1994. Digital also agreed to purchase 1.89 per cent of Olivetti's stock on the stock market by the end of June this year. Olivetti confirmed it had lost L649.9bn (Dollars 445m) last year on sales which fell by 6.8 per cent to L8,025bn. Despite persistent pressure on prices, Mr Carlo De Benedetti, chairman, told shareholders yesterday that Olivetti should break even at the operating level, before extraordinary items, this year and return to profit next year. But he added that the 'very turbulent' market conditions made precise predictions impossible. Mr De Benedetti did not say when the group, again passing its dividend, would restore its payout to shareholders. Sales in the first quarter of this year rose by 5.5 per cent, against the same period in 1992, with sharp volume rises for personal computers and printers. Moreover, Olivetti's most powerful personal computers had accounted for a higher proportion of sales than the previous year. But the company gave no absolute figures for its sales and Mr De Benedetti did not clarify whether the first-quarter turnover figure had been adjusted for currency factors. Olivetti exports a large proportion of its sales, and foreign revenues are likely to be swollen this year by the sharp fall in the lira's value. Shareholders at Olivetti's annual general meeting approved the its L903bn capital increase, comprising a rights issue and a convertible bond, proposed in March. Mr De Benedetti shed no further light on the destination of the funds, but confirmed Digital would take up its full entitlement in shares, not bonds.</p>

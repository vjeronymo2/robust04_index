			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / US dashes hopes of compromise on world trade talks THE US has 'stretched as far as possible' in its negotiations with the European Community aimed at achieving a breakthrough in the Uruguay Round of talks on world trade liberalisation, President George Bush said yesterday in a letter to EC leaders. In a second shot across Europe's bows in one day, the US also announced plans to sell 870,000 tonnes of subsidised vegetable oil worth Dollars 377m (Pounds 219m) to 11 countries. On Wednesday the US trade representative returned from Europe without a settlement on a long-running US-EC oilseeds dispute. This apparent hardening of the US negotiating position coincides with a similar hardening in the EC, as Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, said Europe should stand up to the US in negotiations on subsidised farm trade. His comments will hearten French officials, who have risked creating a deep division inside the EC by insisting they will not sacrifice French farm interests to get Mr Bush re-elected. They accuse EC negotiators of caving in to US pressure. EC officials nevertheless showed concern that France was opposed not only to a farm settlement with the US, but that they did not believe the Common Agricultural Policy reform would work or be adhered to. 'It is clear now that France never really intended to comply with CAP reform,' one senior Commission official said yesterday. EC and US officials believe an agreement on the Uruguay Round must be reached before the US presidential election on November 3, in part because Mr Bush wants to lift his waning electoral fortunes. Talks aimed at reaching a breakthrough fell short of a conclusion in Brussels this week. But negotiators said they had 'narrowed the gap', and will continue talks over this week. Mr Bush said in the letter sent ahead of today's special EC summit in Birmingham, where the stalled Uruguay Round will be on the agenda: 'The negotiators have done all they can. Now we need the political will.' On the eve of the EC summit, the British government spokesman said 'good progress' had been made in the recent EC-US negotiations. He described President Bush's letter as 'optimistic and encouraging' rather than signifying the imposition of a new deadline. It was aimed at giving an impetus to an early and successful conclusion of the Uruguay round of tariff negotiations. French threat to farm reform, Page 6 Oilseeds war, Page 32</p>

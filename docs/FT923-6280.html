			<p>920825 FT  25 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Salmon market back in the pink  -Norway's clearance sale has restored balance DEMAND FOR farmed salmon is set to outstrip supply, according to Mr Ingo Skulason, managing director of Aquastar Norway, a wholly-owned subsidiary of BP Nutrition. Aquastar last year was enlisted by a consortium of Norwegian banks to dispose of a 37,500-tonne mountain of frozen salmon, representing a fifth of Norway's annual production, following last November's bankruptcy of the Norwegian fish farmers' sales organisation. Norway's salmon farmers produce about half of total Atlantic salmon supplies. The salmon mountain was amassed as a result overproduction and led to a world glut and a plunge in prices. Mr Skulason said recently that all but 2,000 tonnes had been sold outside the European Community at a prices between NKr20 and NKr40 (Pounds 1.80 and Pounds 3.60) a kilogram, yielding gross sales of an estimated Pounds 100m. 'With the exception of December, when sales were made at about NKr20 a kilogram, the project has been a success,' he said. 'The situation demanded disposal of the stock in a controlled way outside EC markets. It was crucial to avoid dumping charges, stabilise the market and reduce the turbulence surrounding the matter,' Aquastar explained. The idea was that Aquastar could make use of BP Nutrition's international trading network to market the salmon in a way that avoided violation of Norway's trade policy. To handle the project, Aquastar established a separate unit as a limited liability company in Stavanger, of which Mr Skulason, head of Aquastar Europe, was appointed managing director. It was also in Aquastar's interest to undertake the task in such a way as to provide a basis for profitability, stability and growth of the European fish farming industry. More than 30 countries in eastern Europe and the Far East purchased the salmon, which was sold at prices far above earlier expectations. 'We believe we have succeeded in this big challenge because we had to sell the frozen salmon during low season when prices are normally weaker and we were prohibited from selling in the EC,' Mr Skulason said. He explained that because of the success of the operation, the Norwegian government would be able to recoup a NKr400m non-interest bearing loan provided through the consortium of banks to establish the marketing enterprise. Bank losses would also be minimised. According to Mr Skulason, however, demand for farmed salmon will outstrip supply by the end of this year despite a rise in prices, which have averaged between NKr48 and NKr50 a kilogram in recent weeks, compared with NKr30 to NKr35 in April and May. He forecast a worldwide deficit of some 30,000 tonnes in 1992, growing to to about 51,000 tonnes in 1993. Mr Skulason bases his projections on a number of factors including 'market psychology'. 'The market knows that nearly all of the frozen salmon mountain has been sold, so there is no reason for further speculation about the mountain and its possible affect on market prices, and there are long production lead times preventing farmers from rapidly increasing supply,' he explained. He added that because of the operation's success, stability had been created in the market, fuelling optimism about its future development. In recent years, demand for farmed salmon has increased by 20 to 30 per cent annually, but production exceeded demand. However, with emergence of new markets like southern Europe and with the current high level of prices, Mr Skulason sees at least a two-year window for the salmon-farming industry to yield good profits. By comparison, European demand in 1989 was 146,000 tonnes compared with production of 168,000. There was over-production of about 48,000 tonnes in 1990 and 45,000 tonnes in 1991. In Europe, Aquastar has offices in Belgium, Britain, Spain and Norway but sees opportunities for European expansion during the next few years. It said it was rapidly developing internationally into a well-known trade name and believed that it was set to become a major supplier to branded producers, multiple retailers and in the seafood industry for repackaging for various points of sale.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                    EUROPEAN SALMON MARKET (tonnes)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      1989       1990*       1991*      1992*       1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Supply Norway            124,000     165,000     155,000    126,000    109,000 UK                 29,000      33,000      41,000     40,000     38,000 Ireland             6,000       7,500       8,300      9,000      9,000 Others              9,000      14,000      20,000     16,000     11,000 Total             168,000     219,000     243,000    191,000    167,000  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Estimated Demand            146,000     171,000     198,000    208,000    218,000  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Including frozen stock.

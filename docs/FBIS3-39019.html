			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Concerning the NATO ultimatum to Bosnia, France  played a leadership role. It succeeded in getting the United  States, and finally all the NATO members, to follow in its wake.  This morning Alain Juppe, the French minister of foreign  affairs, repeated that it is essential to find a diplomatic  solution to the matter. But most of all he repeated France's  determination. Here he is:    [Begin Juppe recording] We are told that there has been a  cease-fire agreement, and an agreement to withdraw heavy  weapons. Fine. Let it be implemented in 10 days' time. If it  is implemented 10 days from now, there won't be any problem.  But there must be a signed agreement. An umpteenth cease-fire  is not enough.    If we really want to stop the carnage, a cease-fire is not  enough. The weapons which could at some time make it possible  to start again have to be withdrawn.    France, which has the biggest contingent on the ground --  2,000 troops in Sarajevo -- was the one who made the proposal.  This means we have faced up to our responsibilities, not  without much deep thought, not without taking every possible  precaution, of course, to bring together our men and to protect  them as much as possible, but fully realizing that no protection  plan can be 100 percent effective in such a situation, as  Francois Leotard said here with me last Sunday.

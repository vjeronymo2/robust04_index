			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> 911: NEW EMERGENCY SYSTEM READY TO GO IN HERMOSA BEACH  </P> <P> After a series of failures, Hermosa Beach's 911 telephone equipment has been  replaced and officials expect residents will experience no further problems  when they dial the emergency number.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Public Safety Director Steve Wisniewski conceded that some  fingers may be crossed at City Hall until the new system proves its  reliability.  </P> <P> "We're confident that the problems have been fixed, but time will tell," he  said Thursday. During outages in the system in recent weeks, he said, residents  were able to report emergencies by dialing the Police or Fire departments when  they could not get through on 911.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Problems  </P> <P> Wisniewski said he knows of no complaints nor problems caused by delays in  reporting emergencies.  </P> <P> Hermosa Beach began operating its own 911 number in late December, after  dropping out of the South Bay Regional Public Authority, which had handled  emergency calls from city residents. The city made the switch in hopes of  reducing its costs for emergency dispatch services.  </P> <P> Hermosa Beach's own 911 system crashed for about four hours on Jan. 13, then  again on Jan. 17, and for the last time, officials hope, on Wednesday.  </P> <P> In one case, General Telephone, which provided the equipment, attributed the  failure to external circuit problems. In the others, internal devices in the  911 equipment malfunctioned.  </P> <P> Wisniewski said the phone company had installed used equipment initially but  replaced it with a new system after the third failure on Wednesday. Hermosa  Beach has its own back-up electrical power, a generator and batteries that  automatically kick in whenever there is a failure in line power, he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'No Lack of Power'  </P> <P> "Lack of power wasn't the problem," he said. "Power was still running into the  911 box when the voltage converter or other devices inside the box failed."  </P> <P> General Telephone officials said the company provides 911 systems for 90 police  departments and rarely has technical failures.  </P> <P> When Hermosa Beach decided in late 1987 to exclude itself from the regional  communications center and return to a city-operated dispatch system, officials  projected a savings of from $307,000 to $621,000 over a seven-year period,  Wisniewski said. The amount of savings, he said, will depend on how much the  center increases its charges to member cities between now and 1995.  </P> <P> Those costs, he said, have escalated sharply in recent years, rising from  $82,458 in the fiscal year 1979-80 to a projected $264,891 this year, if the  city had stayed in the regional network.  </P> <P> In addition to acquiring its own 911 equipment, which costs about $25,000, the  city hired five dispatchers, remodeled quarters for them and bought computer  and radio equipment, he said.  </P> <P> The state pays the monthly telephone charges for the 911 number, which leaves  the city with annual costs of $145,000 for the dispatchers and $115,000 for the  computer and radio equipment, Wisniewski said.  </P> <P> Most of the city's savings over what it would have cost if it had remained in  the regional network would occur after Hermosa Beach pays off its equipment  costs in five years, he said.  </P> <P> Robert J. Benson, executive director of the regional communications center,  said that what Hermosa Beach paid toward the cost of operating the center will  be divided among the remaining member cities: Manhattan Beach, El Segundo,  Hawthorne and Gardena. He said he expects no substantial increase in the  center's new budget.  </P> <P> Benson said assessments for an equipment replacement fund accounted for the  increases in fees to members in recent years.  </P> <P> Despite losing the participation of Hermosa Beach, Benson said, "The prospects  for the center are very bright. We provide a level of services and efficiency  that cannot be duplicated by individual cities."  </P> <P> For example, he said, a single dispatcher in a police department may be  overwhelmed by calls in a major emergency, while the center has enough staff to  handle emergencies along with calls from other member cities. High-speed chases  through several cities also can be better coordinated at the center, he said.  </P> <P> The regional center began operations in 1975 with seven member cities. Palos  Verdes Estates dropped out in 1981 and Redondo Beach left the network two years  later.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. GRAND JURY OPENS PROBE OF BRADLEY CONDUCT  </P> <P> A federal grand jury in Los Angeles has opened a wide-ranging criminal  investigation into Mayor Tom Bradley's conduct in office and his personal  finances, including his business ties to eight banks and brokerage firms, it  was learned Thursday.  </P> <P> The investigation surfaced through the serving of a subpoena this month on the  city treasurer's office, an agency that has been near the center of controversy  surrounding the mayor over the last year. A copy of the subpoena was obtained  by The Times Thursday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Moved Slowly  </P> <P> The grand jury's involvement in the case represents a significant acceleration  of a federal investigation that had moved slowly for months.  </P> <P> A federal official close to the case confirmed that investigators now are  seeking evidence to present to the grand jury for a possible indictment.  </P> <P> "There's no two ways about it," said the federal official, who asked not to be  identified. "This is a grand jury that is looking at Mr. Bradley. It's the old  saying, 'Where there's smoke there is fire,' and there is heavy smoke here.  </P> <P> "We don't know yet if we are going to find criminality or just some bad  judgment, but there's certainly enough to go through the grand jury process.  It's a real thing."  </P> <P> The federal grand jury has more powers than any of the city agencies that have  investigated the mayor thus far. It has the authority to compel witnesses to  testify under oath and can subpoena virtually any records, including personal  income tax returns.  </P> <P> Assistant U.S. Atty. Jeffrey Eglash, whose name appears on the subpoena, said:  "I can't comment. I can't say anything."  </P> <P> FBI Special Agent Stanley Ornellas seemed surprised when told that the subpoena  was made public Thursday. Citing FBI policy, Ornellas refused to discuss the  subpoenas.  </P> <P> The subpoena was sweeping. Served Sept. 11 by FBI agents for the U.S.  attorney's office, it ordered the treasurer to surrender any and all documents  relating to an assortment of allegations against the mayor. Among other items,  the subpoena sought records related to a bank that hired the mayor as an  adviser and a Beverly Hills brokerage house that sold him junk bonds.  </P> <P> Bradley has also has received a federal subpoena requesting documents, said  Bill Chandler, the mayor's spokesman.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Relevant Information  </P> <P> "The mayor will cooperate in providing all relevant and appropriate information  to aid in this investigation," Chandler said. "The mayor is confident that  there has been no impropriety on his part."  </P> <P> Chandler declined to specify when the subpoena was served on the mayor and what  records it sought.  </P> <P> Disclosure of the grand jury involvement comes two weeks after City Atty. James  K. Hahn issued a report that found insufficient evidence to prosecute Bradley  on conflict-of-interest charges. Hahn nonetheless attacked Bradley's  "indifference" to ethical concerns in recent years and said the mayor had  "clearly stepped into the gray area" between innocence and a chargeable  offense.  </P> <P> Until recent weeks, federal authorities were divided over whether to pursue an  investigation of Bradley in connection with his investments through Drexel  Burnham Lambert Inc. and its former junk-bond king, Michael Milken, who has  been indicted on charges of fraud and insider trading.  </P> <P> Sources have told The Times that authorities in New York City initially wanted  to launch an investigation of Bradley, while officials in Los Angeles were  reluctant.  </P> <P> However, the Justice Department's public integrity section headquarters in  Washington, which is overseeing the federal probe, ruled there were sufficient  grounds to investigate Bradley. FBI agents in Los Angeles recently became  active in the case.  </P> <P> Sources familiar with federal political investigations said that a grand jury  subpoena generally indicates that a probe is becoming serious. A subpoena  normally is issued after FBI field agents have already sifted through available  evidence, including documents and interviews that are provided voluntarily.  </P> <P> The subpoena was disclosed Thursday as part of a status report to the City  Council on the embattled city treasurer's office. City Administrative Officer  Keith Comrie said his auditors "stumbled" across the document while monitoring  investment activities by the city treasurer in the wake of a controversy  involving Bradley and Far East National Bank.  </P> <P> "We were over talking to the city treasurer and he said, 'Look at this  (subpoena). I've got all this work to do,' " Comrie said.  </P> <P> The subpoena demands the treasurer's office produce by Oct. 10 "all notes,  drafts, calendars, diaries, logs, account statements and other written  material, photos, graphs, computer disks, tapes and other recordings" regarding  four financial institutions and four brokerage houses.  </P> <P> The financial institutions are Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Assn., Far East  National Bank, Valley Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. and Gibraltar Savings  &amp; Loan Assn.  </P> <P> Columbia is under the scrutiny of federal regulators as part of the  insider-trading case brought against Drexel and Milken. Bradley has a close  political relationship with Columbia Chairman Abraham Spiegel and has invested  in Columbia stocks and bonds.  </P> <P> The grand jury subpoena requests all documents involving investment banker Ira  Distenfield, a former Harbor Commission president and one of Bradley's biggest  contributors.  </P> <P> The grand jury has requested documents that involve three companies that  employed Distenfield: ITD Inc.; Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards Inc., and Smith,  Barney, Harris, Upham &amp; Co. The fourth investment firm is Drexel.  </P> <P> Last May, Distenfield suddenly resigned his powerful Harbor Commission post as  The Times was preparing a report on sworn statements he had made in 1987 before  a confidential New York Stock Exchange arbitration hearing. In his testimony,  Distenfield said he used his influence with Bradley to obtain a hotly contested  contract for Smith, Barney, which employed him as an executive.  </P> <P> Bradley has denied that he was influenced by Distenfield.  </P> <P> It was not immediately clear how many individuals or agencies were served with  grand jury subpoenas.  </P> <P> Ronald L. Olson, an attorney representing Far East Chairman Henry Hwang, whose  payments to Bradley as a bank adviser ignited the ethics scandal, said late  Thursday, "I am not able to respond on anything" regarding demands for records.  </P> <P> A banking source said Thursday that Columbia Savings apparently received a  subpoena to furnish federal authorities with numerous documents.  </P> <P> Spokesmen for several city offices that have figured in the controversy and  investigations -- including the city controller, city administrative officer,  city clerk, Community Redevelopment Agency and Harbor Department -- said they  had not received subpoenas.  </P> <P> According to sources familiar with federal investigations of public officials,  such subpoenas are issued if potential witnesses refuse to turn over needed  documents or if the case reaches a point where criminal charges are seriously  contemplated.  </P> <P> "Once they start doing the subpoena process, that means that the case is very  good," said one source experienced in federal political cases.  </P> <P> It could take weeks, even months, from the time that documents are subpoenaed  until the investigation takes its next step: calling witnesses before the grand  jury, the sources said.  </P> <P> News of the expanding interest in Bradley's financial affairs by federal  investigators represents a major political setback for the mayor.  </P> <P> It comes as the mayor and his aides are pressing a new public relations  offensive to put the six-month-old controversy behind them. That effort,  including a series of image-building public appearances and dogged insistence  that Bradley has been cleared of any improprieties, was launched Sept. 14 when  Hahn concluded his investigation.  </P> <P> Chandler said Thursday that the expanded federal investigation will not affect  the mayor's performance.  </P> <P> "He is certainly attending to city business, and it is business as usual,"  Chandler said. "The city attorney's report is behind us, and the mayor is  moving forward."  </P> <P> Times staff writers Rich Connell, Frederick M. Muir, William Overend, Joel  Sappell, Henry Weinstein and Tracy Wood contributed to this article.  </P> <P> </P> <P> UNDER SCRUTINY  </P> <P>  The U.S. attorney subpoenaed documents relating to the following businesses  and individuals as part of a grand jury investigation into Mayor Tom Bradley's  finances and conduct in office:  </P> <P>  FAR EAST NATIONAL BANK -- Paid Bradley $18,000 as an adviser during 1988.  Bradley later returned the money. In March, 1989, after the mayor talked to  City Treasurer Leonard Rittenberg, the city reinstated a $1-million deposit  with the bank and added another $1 million, both without competitive bids. A  treasurer's office employee later obliterated a notation on a bid sheet that  had indicated that the investment was made "per the mayor."  </P> <P> VALLEY FEDERAL SAVINGS &amp; LOAN -- For about 10 years beginning in 1978, paid  Bradley up to $24,000 a year as adviser. During that period, the mayor signed  ordinances that permitted a subsidiary of Valley Federal to develop land.  </P> <P> COLUMBIA SAVINGS &amp; LOAN ASSN. -- Bradley has a long and close relationship  with Columbia Chairman Abraham Spiegel and has invested in the company's stocks  and bonds. Spiegel has won zoning variances from the city for real estate  development projects. Columbia has been scrutinized by federal regulators as  part of the insider trading case against Drexel Burnham Lambert junk bond king  Michael Milken, who faces a 98-count federal indictment.  </P> <P> DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT -- Bradley maintained a special trading account within  Milken's high-yield bond unit at Drexel and purchased at least one security,  Gibraltar Financial Corp. bonds, when it was not available to the general  public. Bradley later urged federal lawmakers to allow Drexel to maintain its  junk bond division in Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> GIBRALTAR SAVINGS &amp; LOAN -- Held several hundred million dollars in city  funds. The mayor had invested $100,000 in junk bonds issued by the thrift's  parent, Gibraltar Financial Corp., and apparently lost most of his investment.  City treasurer's office documents show white correction fluid was applied to  numerous bid records involving Gibraltar deposits.  </P> <P> IRA DISTENFIELD -- Resigned as president of the Harbor Commission last May as  The Times was preparing a report that he used his clout with Bradley to steer  city business to the investment firm of Smith Barney, Harris Upham. The request  for records includes Smith Barney and two other investment firms that later  employed Distenfield -- Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards and ITD Inc. Since 1985,  Distenfield has been one of Bradley biggest political donors, contributing more  than $86,000.Mayor Tom BradleyLos Angeles Times  </P></p>

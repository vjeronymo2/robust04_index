			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO CHUMP  </P> <P> Every time Calendar decides to play wiseacre trade paper by running a  figure-oriented analysis, it turns out to be unreadable, boring and inaccurate.  </P> <P> The equations in Klady's article are of no interest to non-industry readers,  but you at least should be accurate as you flippantly dump on the "chumps."  </P> <P> I refer to the budget figure of "Memories of Me" (MGM), given as $12 million.  It was less than half that, namely $5.8 million! (And don't tell me your number  includes distribution expenses because there are many other picture costs  listed which obviously don't include prints and advertising.)  </P> <P> Moreover, at the $5.8-million budget, the financiers will probably not lose  when all other revenue sources are counted.  </P> <P> Neither the pictures that are unsuccessful nor the many people who make them  are "chumps." The pictures are assets, and the people could make next year's  box-office smash. The real "chumps" are you guys who rarely have an original  thought, whose major "talent" is thrashing somebody else's creative effort.  </P> <P> GABE SUMNER  </P> <P> Executive Producer  </P> <P> "Memories of Me"  </P></p>

			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Letter: Sophistication of the Polish consumer Sir, Although I am unable to devote the time necessary to refute each point James Morgan addresses in 'Poland wakes to the day of the deal' (April 13) let me bring just one of his mis-statements to light. In his attempt to characterise Polish consumers as unsophisticated and naive, Mr Morgan writes that Poland is filled with 'goods well past their sell-by dates, which are incomprehensible to most Poles. The labelling of these goods comes in any language but Polish'. For a few weeks last year I conducted an economic experiment by working as a street-side vendor in Warsaw. After all, how could I claim to offer economic advise to Poland without a real, first-hand knowledge of the nuts and bolts of the Polish economy? So I joined the crowd of Polish traders on the night train to west Berlin, stocked up with several crates of Dutch chocolates, returned to Warsaw, and set up shop on Marszalkowska Street. The first thing that virtually every potential customer did was bring my attention to the expired sell-by date. It was the worldly American who had unwittingly purchased out-dated merchandise. Likewise, with the ski jackets I was selling the next week. Although 'Made in China' does not look much like 'Wyprodukowano w Chinach', it was universally understandable - and unfortunately not much of a selling point. It is the clever entrepreneurial spirit of the Poles, not their desire to cheat and exploit, that will lead to Poland's return to 'western' Europe.

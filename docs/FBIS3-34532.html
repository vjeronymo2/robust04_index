			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, has said her  government is committed to self-reliance and indigenization of  defense production to break the shackles of dependence. She was  speaking at the roll-out ceremony of the first Pakistani rebuilt  F- 7P aircraft in the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex [PAC] at  Kamra today. The prime minister said:    [Begin Bhutto recording] Self-reliance is the key to  national security, especially in the field of defense  technology. However, we cannot increase our self-reliance,  particularly in the field of defense technology unless we  develop the scientific potential amongst the people of our  country. And, that is one of the objectives of this government  to encourage people to go into science and into the higher  elements of scientific study. Yesterday, the cabinet took a  decision that every [word indistinct] or every top scientists  who does a Ph.D in this country will be given an additional  stipend for one year to encourage the young people of our  country to choose the scientific field to develop the full  scientific potential of this country. The people's government  is committed both to self-reliance and to the indigenization of  defense production to break the shackles of dependence -- a  dependence that has cost us truly in the past wars. History  teaches us that nations who depend on others to fortify their  defense. [sentence as heard] We consider the defense of our  homeland the foremost policy. Last time as prime minister of  the people's government, I authorized this F-7P overhaul project  at PAC, Kamra, in December 1989. Therefore, it is a special  privilege for me to come here and witness the completion of this  project. [end recording]    The prime minister said let us pray to almighty Allah that  he  may grant us the strength and wisdom to make our nation  self-reliance and strong for the safety and well-being of our  people. Acknowledging the skill of engineers and technicians of  F-7P rebuilt factory, she said:    [Begin Bhutto recording] A nation is great not only because  of machines, a nation is great because of the talented men and  women who give of their best. History is the story of human  success. There is no doubt that the foundations of an aviation  industry in Pakistan has now been laid. Our achievements over  two decades bear the testimony to this fact. [end recording]    Addressing the ceremony, Defense Minister Aftab Shaban  Mirani  assured that the government is carefully monitoring the  strategic plans in the region and is fully alive to the defense  needs of the country. He said the government is favorably  inclined to the indigenous development of defense products and  the private sector is welcomed in this field.    The director general of Pakistan Aeronautical Complex, Air  Marshal Dilawar Hussain, in his welcome address said that trial  rebuilt phase comprises overhaul of three aircraft -- one  rolling out today, the second to be overhauled by the end of  this month and the third in April this year.    Later, Ms. Benazir Bhutto witnessed static display of F-7P  aircraft. She formally handed over the aircraft to Pakistan Air  Force. F-7P is the battle-honored aircraft with high  maneuverability in air combat. The aircraft in its modified and  improved version is a potent weapon system with modern avionic  fire control system and multifarious load carrying capability to  fulfill intercept and attack role.</p>

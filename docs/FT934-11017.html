			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Yeltsin urges ministers to speed reform PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin of Russia yesterday told his government ministers that they were dragging their feet on reforms and ignoring the social needs of the population. In a stiff rebuke he said that those who took part in the Moscow demonstration a month ago which culminated in armed clashes round the parliament and the TV stations were 'not just criminals and bandits, but also desperate people,' deprived of benefits and wages. The Russian president said that a separation of powers embodied in the presidency and a new parliament - to be elected on December 12 - was essential, in spite of what he described as the growing affection of some officials and ministers for an authoritarian system. It was, he said, 'a crude mistake' on their part to doubt the need for different levels of authority. Mr Yeltsin said that steps must now be taken to make the rouble convertible 'stage by stage,' building on its stable rate against the dollar in the past few months. He said, however, that the state must be actively involved in the management of the economy - instancing the need to develop an efficient mechanism of land sales following his decree last week allowing Russians to buy and sell land freely. Also speaking to the enlarged meeting of the cabinet with regional leaders, Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, said that Russia now had the 'blueprint for a market economy' - and forecast a slowing of inflation and the fall in production in the coming months. Figures in a report considered by the ministers yesterday pointed to a continued fall in Russia's gross domestic product, by 11 per cent in the first nine months of 1993 compared with the same period the previous year. Industrial production fell by 17 per cent and capital investment by 10 per cent - while inter-enterprise debt grew to Rbs11.300bn and national income fell by 15 per cent - an index of the rapid rise in poverty. The budget deficit for the year is put at Rbs17,000bn, with a fourth quarter deficit of Rbs5,500bn - Rbs4,500bn of which will be financed by central bank borrowing and the remainder by the issuing of government bonds. Mr Chernomyrdin, however, said 'the worst is now over,' and inflation - now around 20-25 per cent a month - should come down to 16 per cent by next March and end next year at around 5 per cent. The trade surplus for this year is expected to be around Dollars 21bn, after drastic pruning of imports. Both the president and the prime minister criticised - without naming names  -members of the cabinet who are now engaged in election campaigns as leaders of their various parties.</p>

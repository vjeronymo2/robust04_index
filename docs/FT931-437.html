			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Inchcape motors ahead Management gurus may preach the virtues of focused businesses these days but Inchcape puts in a strong case for the attractions of diversity. The company's broad geographic and product spread enabled it to skirt regional recessions and register a 28 per cent increase in annual profits, on a FRS 3 basis. Under new management, the sprawling trading group has evolved into a safe, yet aggressive, international investment. Many of its activities, which span water-testing services in the US to distributing Toyota cars in the UK, have a defensive feel. Yet Inchcape is one of the few UK companies with a substantial exposure to the fast-growing markets of southern China. Last year's results were boosted by acquisitions which accounted for three-quarters of the 41 per gain in operating profits. Still, the underlying profits growth was robust. The company should seemingly be a significant beneficiary of sterling's devaluation since it generates 77 per cent of its profits overseas. But this equation may not be as simple as it seems. Many Japanese companies are struggling to maintain their price competitiveness because of the strength of the yen. Inchcape is unlikely to escape its share of the margin pain. There are certainly enough opportunities to keep Inchcape motoring in the future. But, in the short term, there should be more share price excitement elsewhere. The company's shares have shot ahead since the acquisition of TKM. But Inchcape now trades on a similar rating to some of the likeliest recovery shares. Their depressed earnings should bound ahead faster if the UK's tentative economic revival is sustained.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Swift and Justified Palestinian Revenge"] </F>   [Text] The fedayeen operation carried out by the men of  the intifadah in Hebron yesterday, resulting in two Israeli  settlers being killed and a third wounded, was in retaliation to  the attacks carried out by armed settlers on the people of the  town which left at least 18 people wounded.    The striking thing is that the Palestinian retaliation was  carried out one day after the incident in question -- which  means that there is a decision not to stay silent about any  Israeli attacks in the future, whether in Hebron or elsewhere.    The Israeli authorities are responsible for these violent  incidents. Because they defied the international will and  sought to continue to humiliate the Palestinians when they  refused to remove their settlements and settlers from Hebron in  the wake of the tension that dominated the area following the  al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, which resulted in the martyrdom of  at least 100 people.    When Israeli Environment Minister Yosi Sarid says that  coexistence between the Arabs and the Jews in the town is no  longer possible, he is adding nothing new. All settlements in  the occupied territories represent for the Arabs a constant  provocation and an obstacle to any peace process.    The Rabin government wanted to use the Hebron settlements in  particular as a bargaining chip to secure some concessions from  the PLO. Because it knew that the latter was in an embarrassing  situation after the massacre. And now it is realizing just how  costly that reckless and unstudied action has proved to be.    What applies to the Hebron settlements applies to the Gaza  Strip settlements, whose population does not exceed 4,000  settlers and which do not represent any economic or security  value aside from disrupting the Palestinians' existence and  continuing to embarrass the Palestinian leadership.    In the past Israeli governments have used security as an  excuse to build and expand settlements. But since Iraq's  al-Husayn missiles landed in downtown Tel Aviv without missing  their targets even once, all these pretexts and excuses have  collapsed and the settlements have become a burden on the  security of Israel and the Israelis and the object of Arab and  international criticisms.    It is fortunate that the Israeli tide of violence and the  swift Palestinian revenge for those wounded by the settlers'  bullets should coincide with Israeli [as published] Secretary of  State Warren Christopher's visit to the region in the framework  of his shuttle between Damascus and occupied Jerusalem to  reactivate the Israeli-Syrian track. Prehaps Christopher  realizes for the umpteenth time the danger of continued Israeli  occupation and its impact on peace and stability in the region  as a whole.    Israel, which is submitting a long list of impossible  conditions and giving priority to normalization before any  positive step regarding withdrawal, is refusing to abandon many  of its aggressive aspects so that it can become a state, like  other states, that respects international law.    It is unnatural for international observers to enjoy respect  and cooperation from host states throughout the world, and  nothing but scorn, maltreatment, and spying [from Israel], as  mentioned by a Danish newspaper, quoting circles close to Danish  soldiers in Hebron.    The crisis lies in the presence of a man like Rabin, who  continues to think like a general and has no clear strategic  views for peace. This is why he and his government continue to  act haphazardly inside and outside the occupied territory. So  we must expect more surprises in Hebron and elsewhere in the  coming days and months.</p>

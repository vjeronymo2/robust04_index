			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Company News (This Week): CBS - Other Companies The boards of CBS, the US television broadcasting network, and QVC, the television shopping channel headed by Mr Barry Diller, a top Hollywood executive, will meet on Wednesday to consider the proposed merger between the two groups which was announced on June 30. Both companies seem certain to approve the transaction, which has sharply boosted their share prices. But it will take another 90 to 120 days to complete, and a hostile bid for CBS could emerge during that period.</p>

			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coal buyers face a sellers' market Japanese steel mills may reach agreement with their Australian and Canadian suppliers this week. Price rises are inevitable but the risk faced by the mills is that if no settlement is arrived at over the next few days, the rises could be large. Already one producer - Coal and Allied of New South Wales - has tabled a demand for an increase of Dollars 6.90 a tonne. This seemed to the steel producers more than a touch ambitious but in the ensuing weeks it has become clear that 1995 is going to see price rises across the whole spectrum of coal qualities. All prices set to date for next year relate to steam coal - and almost all for buyers in Europe. In contrast to previous years, when early settlements set something close to a benchmark for all European buyers, 1995 prices have steadily risen since the first agreement in October, between the Belgian power company Electrabel and South African producers at around Dollars 30.50 a tonne, fob Richards Bay. Subsequent South African sales have been struck at around Dollars 32 into Portugal and - for one customer suddenly facing a shortfall - at around Dollars 37.00 to a German utility for a high calorific value coal. While no one expects contract prices to reach the heady levels seen on the spot market, the rising trend was reinforced with some very large purchases by Enel, the Italian power company, at Dollars 32.60, fob. Two big power groups have yet to settle their South African business - Dutch buyer GKE and Danish power producers Elsam and SK Power. The South Africans are thought to expect very high levels from these customers, higher even than the Enel price, not least to balance some of the very low prices that these companies achieved for their 1994 deliveries. One South African producer has already won a Dollars 10 price rise from the Danes, although this came from a very low level, in the low Dollars 20s, for this year's business. The view that prices will rise throughout the period of settlement is backed by the strength of the spot market with the McCloskey Coal Information Services North-west Europe marker price having risen Dollars 1.49 to Dollars 42.22 between November and December. This rise is second highest ever recorded in the index - the highest, of Dollars 1.84, was in the preceding month. The rise in the MCIS index reflects not only higher fob prices but also a very strong ocean freight market. Some buyers, like National Power, saw the threat of this rise back in the early summer and booked their shipping tonnage according. Those who have waited or have still to settle, will pay dear. For the Australia coal producers, and the Australians are the most powerful selling group in the Japanese coking coal negotiations, very few settlements have been made with European power companies. Partly this reflects their very robust price rise demands of Dollars 6 - at which one piece of business has already been struck. Their efforts to sustain a rising market will receive vigorous support from the Colombian producer Carbocol, which has yet to settle any of its 1995 business. Its expectations match those of Australia, as does its belief that producers should not be in any hurry; the biggest prizes are expected to fall to those who wait. No doubt these rises, which could well be sustained into 1996 and beyond, will encourage those who have backed the RJB Mining bid for the English coal mines. The RJB assumption for international prices is of Dollars 39, cif, a tonne in 1998. But while today's international prices will close the gap with UK costs, it is one of the oddities of the UK coal market that its highest value product of house coal is in glut. This is partly a result of the mild northern winter, but also reflects increased competition from imports and from RJB's major UK competitor, Coal Investments.</p>

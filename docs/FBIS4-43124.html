			<p>BFN     [Text] Nicosia, June 12 (AFP) -- Sixteen Iranian  asylum-seekers facing expulsion from Turkey are not members of  the armed opposition People's Mujahedin, the group said Sunday  [12 June].    "The persons in question are not in any way related to the  Mujahedeen and its activities," it said in a statement sent to  AFP in Nicosia.    "The Government of Turkey is responsible for the protection  and safety of all Iranian asylum-seekers," the group said, a day  after the Turkish news agency ANATOLIA said they were being  expelled to Iraq.    "If for whatever reason it does not wish to accept them, it  must relocate them in European countries with the help of the  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees," said the  Mujahedeen.    It said the group had helped the 16 Iranians seek refuge in  Turkey for humanitarian reasons only. They had been living in  Ramadi, west of Baghdad, and some had been POWs during the  1980-1988 war between Iran and Iraq.    But ANATOLIA said the 16 had confessed to having entered  Turkey with false passports and received military training at a  Mujahedin camp in Iraq.    The Turkish Interior Ministry rejected their request for  political asylum and drove them to Silopi on the Iraqi border,  it reported, quoting a senior police official as saying the  expulsion was a goodwill gesture to Iran.</p>

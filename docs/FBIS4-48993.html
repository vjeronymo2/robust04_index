			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By L. K. Sheng and Y. C. Tsai] </F>   [Text] Asuncion, April 28 (CNA) -- The Republic of China  [ROC] and Paraguay Thursday [28 April] entered into an agreement  eliminating the need for citizens in one country working in the  other to pay income tax to both governments.    Augustin Liu, Taiwan's ambassador to Paraguay, and  Paraguayan  Foreign Minister Luis Maria Ramirez Boettner inked the accord,  which aims to promote reciprocal investments between the two  countries.    Under the agreement, which will be effective for five years,  nationals of each country working in the other country can still  be taxed by both governments on income earned from interest,  royalties, and property transactions.    This is the third such pact Taiwan has signed. It earlier  entered into similar agreements with Singapore and South Africa.    Speaking at the signing ceremony, Ramirez expressed the hope  that Taiwan investors would make more investments in Paraguay,  thereby introducing advanced technology into the South American  country.    Ambassador Liu said the agreement will help boost investment  ties between the two countries, which is the Taipei Government's  established policy.</p>

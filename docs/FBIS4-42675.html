			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Ilnur Cevik: "The Very Poor State of the </F> Press"]    [Text] Recently, we published an exclusive report on the  state of the press in Turkey and we listed the facts of the  sorrowful situation in our country. After our report was  published, we were flooded with calls both from the press bosses  and from our readers. We were congratulated by the public for  our bold stand while some newspaper publishers complained that  the report did not represent the facts.    We had said the newspaper in Turkey had turned into a "state  press" because all the leading papers were receiving state  assistance. Some publishers strongly disputed this and said  their editorial policies had reflected a pro-state stance simply  because Turkey was going through hard times and they felt they  had to defend the government "as we are all in the same boat."    Last week the public was shocked when it was revealed that  Prime Minister Tansu Ciller issued a new memorandum to state  banks that all the advertisement they gave would be subject to  the approval of the prime minister. So the prime minister will  serve as an official advertising agency. Beyond that it became  public that with such an application the prime minister is  admitting she has created a state press that will receive its  advertising money straight from her.    So whoever is pro-government can get ads from the state  banks  but if you speak the truth and try to correct the ills of the  country then you will face a boycott from the prime minister.  We have seen all this too many times before and they have never  succeeded. What is said is that now the leading newspapers with  the exception of SABAH (because we have seen in the past few  weeks that the paper does not run front page advertisements of  state banks) are all running ads of state banks on the  right-hand bottom corners of their front pages and thus the  prime minister's memorandum has cast a shadow on their editorial  policies.    It is hard to understand why the prime minister issued such  a  memorandum and by doing so admitted her guilt of trying to  control the newspapers. She was already providing heavy  subsidies to the press that support her. She was giving them  incentives and advertisements especially by state banks. So why  make it all public?    No wonder our press is being described as a "state press"  abroad and among diplomats in Turkey. What a great shame.</p>

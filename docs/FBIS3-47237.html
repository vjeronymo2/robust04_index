This is in addition to demands that North Korea comply fully  with International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections and  engage in dialogue with South Korea, they said.    Seoul and Washington share two common goals, Senators Sam  Nunn and Richard Lugar told a press conference winding up a  four-day visit to Seoul.    The goals are to preserve peace and stability on the Korean  peninsula, avoid proliferation of nuclear weapons and prevent  North Korea from becoming a nuclear state, they said.    "This challenge we face together, I believe, has to be met  with firmness, determination and calmness," said Nunn, chairman  of the Senate Armed Services Committee.    North Korea must satisfy the IAEA on inspections of all  declared and undeclared sites, Nunn listed as one of the terms  to bettering ties with North Korea.    It must also accept all legitimate demands "made by the IAEA  for the purpose of assuring the world that North Korea is in  compliance with the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and its  obligation," Nunn said.    North Korea would also have to sit down to discuss with  South  Korea denuclearizing their peninsula.    "Beyond that, there would have to be some understanding and  discussions regarding North Korea's past behavior in terms of  terrorism, and also including the case for missile technology,"  he told reporters.    Nunn described North Korea's unexpectedly frequent return of  the purported remains of missing American soldiers from the  Korean war over the past few months as "one encouraging sign"  and said solution of the nuclear problem would be a "very  important first step."    The senators' visit has been described as a field trip to  tap  all possible countermeasures to North Korea's nuclear problem.  They came to Seoul after making stops in Moscow and Tokyo.    Asked about the viability of economic sanctions and military  strikes should diplomatic efforts fail, Lugar advised the  involved parties to be "thoughtful and careful."    He repeated President Bill Clinton's words that an attack on  South Korea is an attack on the United States.    "We ought to say we are prepared for all contingencies,"  Lugar said. "But my own view is we ought to be thoughtful,  patient and persistent and that time is on our side."    It's important to apply pressure "without being provocative,  dramatic," the senator said.    Tying what he saw in Russia with North Korea, Nunn warned of  economic collapse if Pyongyang continues on its present path.    "There is a powerful lesson in here (Russia) for North  Korea," he said.    "It's apparent that a nation cannot continue to really have  an economy that sustains its people if it invests the kind of  percentage of GNP in defense that Russia did in the past and  North Korea continues to do today," he said.</p>

			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> Literary Find: Two works by Ernest Hemingway found among handwritten  manuscripts at the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston will be published for the  first time next month. The two short stories will appear in the spring issue of  the Hemingway Review.  </P> <P> The finds were made by Susan Beegel, an independent scholar, and Donald  Junkins, a professor at the University of Massachusetts.  </P> <P> Honors: Tennis star Billie Jean King and Texas politician Barbara Jordan will  be inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame Aug. 26. They were chosen  from about 1,000 nominees, Sally Parr, the hall's executive director, said  Wednesday in Washington, D.C. The other inductees are the late photojournalist  Margaret Bourke-White and Florence Siebert, a medical researcher who isolated  and purified protein.  </P> <P> Next Question: Richard Nixon still has the press to kick around. His new book,  "In the Arena," contains some examples of typical reporters' comments, and what  the former President thinks they really mean: Reporter: "You should hear what  this other guy said about you." Nixon: "This is . . . entrapment . . . . Don't  be surprised if your angry jibe appears in print and his doesn't." Reporter:  "I'm going to write the story, whether you talk to me or not." Nixon: "The  reporter might be worried he doesn't have a story at all unless you talk to  him."  </P> <P> Hospitalized: Joy Baker, wife of former Senate Republican Leader Howard H.  Baker Jr., has had a small malignant growth removed from her right lung. The  tumor was removed Wednesday at a hospital in Rochester, Minn. A source familiar  with her case, who did not wish to be identified, said the growth was "a  low-grade tumor," not a recurrence of the cancer removed from the same lung in  1982.  </P></p>

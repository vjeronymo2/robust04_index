			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou sees a simple  decrease in the ever-increasing number of Turkish provocations  behind tonight's appeasement attempt by Ankara following the  strong reaction caused by Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's  statement. Replying to correspondents' questions this evening at  the Astir Hotel in Vouliagmeni, Prime Minister Papandreou also  referred to other current issues.    [Begin recording] [Correspondent Roula Kambouryiani] Prime  Minister Papandreou sees an increase in the Turkish  provocations, despite the attempts by Turkish Foreign Minister  Hikmet Cetin and Turkish President Suleyman Demirel to calm the  situation. Papandreou talked about an attempt by Turkey to  create an artificial tension that is dangerous.    [Papandreou] As you know, a short while ago Cetin said there  was no such meaning in Ciller's statement, and what appeared  momentarily as an artificial tension with an unknown aim has  been relieved somewhat, which we welcome.    [Unidentified correspondent] Do you expect Turkish  provocations to increase following the Kurdish issue?    [Papandreou] There is already an increase. There has been a  small drop off in that increase of tension, because Demirel also  made a statement referring to President Konstandinos Karamanlis,  saying that they signed agreements together. This is an attempt  to tone down their rhetoric. We hope that this continues,  because all these problems are artificial and, of course,  dangerous.    [Correspondent] The issue of Skopje [The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] is at a new round of negotiations.  Next week Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias will meet Cyrus  Vance. What do you expect?    [Papandreou] What do I expect? I do not know. We hope that  this issue ends quickly. [FYROM President Kiro] Gligirov thinks  it will take time. We will see. Nothing is assumed.

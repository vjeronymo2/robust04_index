			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / International Company News: Bull sells part of US operations to Wang Groupe Bull, the French state-owned computer manufacturer, yesterday announced it would sell part of its US and international services activities to Wang of the US for Dollars 160m in cash, bonds and shares. The French group will take a 5 per cent stake in the US company and a seat on Wang's board. The US company will also become a distributor of Bull products, including its Unix open systems and its Data Zenith Systems personal computers. The companies described the deal as a strategic alliance. Mr Axel le Blois, chief executive of Bull Information Systems, said the agreement would give Bull critical mass in servicing clients and provide financial resources for its other US activities, including ZDS and its enterprise server business. Mr Joe Tucci, chief executive of Wang, said the accord would expand the company's customer services, solutions integration, and software activities. He said the effect of the various acquisitions would increase earnings and cash flow per share. Bull will sell a number of service activities of Bull HN, its US subsidiary. These include Bull HN's field maintenance services, which provide repairs and maintenance to customers across the US, and its operations in Canada, New Zealand and Mexico. Wang will acquire Bull's HFSI federal systems integration business, which operates exclusively with the US government. The businesses to be transferred to Wang have annual sales of about Dollars 450m, of which about Dollars 320m is in the US. Afterwards, Bull's US sales should fall to about FFr1.2bn (Dollars 220m) annually, from an expected FFr1.5bn for 1995 before the deal. Both companies are in the middle of strategic reorganisations.</p>

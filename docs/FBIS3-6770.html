Over the past thirty years more than 2,500 local industrial  factories have made their appearance throughout the country and  their modernisation level improved considerably.    Foodstuff, textile, garment, paper-making and other local  industrial factories, over twenty on an average, have been  built in cities and counties which had only a few ones thirty  years ago.    The Sakju foodstuff factory with a plottage of more than  24,000 square metres has all its production processes  streamlined.    The local industrial factories in Anju city now produce  consumer goods of more than 1,420 kinds, or twice as many as  turned out in South Pyongan Province in the initial period of  the local industrial development.    The local industrial factories throughout the country now  fully meet the material needs of the population by firmly  relying upon the raw materials available in local areas.    There are more than 42,500 hectares of raw (?materiel  cultivation) bases across the country, which produce over 8,000  kinds of consumer goods.</p>

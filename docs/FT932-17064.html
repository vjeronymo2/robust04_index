			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Labour-saving devices In theory we PR fanatics should be wildly excited at the news that the Labour party may be about to hoist the flag of electoral reform, a cause I have supported all my life. Britain's method of electing its MPs is a turn-off to many able individuals who might otherwise choose a career in politics. It has produced a disastrous succession of elective dictatorships that have shuffled us towards the despondent last decade of a century of relative decline. First-past-the-post? Phooey. That discredited mech- anism produced the dross that has governed us for most of the years since 1945. Even the Italians, who are talking about abandoning their excessively proportional system, do not appear likely to take our poison undiluted. The key words in the above little outburst are 'in theory'. If Labour goes into the next election on a platform that includes fair voting for the House of Commons (and any system would be fairer than the present winner-takes-all) it will deserve to win. This is not to say that it will do so. On present form it looks set for a fifth election defeat, ex or cum a new system of voting. A possible policy change by a natural party of opposition does not quicken anyone's pulse. Let's make it simple. Almost exactly a year ago Mr Neil Kinnock's Labour party - reformed, tarted-up, smiling and eager - scored less than 35 per cent of the vote. You may analyse the reasons until kingdom come, or, if you want a little longer, until the opinion polls are trusted once again. The answer will always be the same: Labour was perceived to be a party of the past, in hock to the trade unions, more likely to smother enterprise than to respond to the aspirations of ordinary people. The south of England and even some Scottish constituencies rejected it. If the same perception holds when the next election comes in 1996 or 1997 the party will be rejected once again. Even the present sorry lot of Conservatives will win, even if Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, cuts a deal with Mr Paddy Ashdown's Liberal Democrats. This was not how it seemed in the summer of 1987, when my simple-minded analysis of the arithmetic of Lady Thatcher's victory that year led to the conclusion that what Labour had to do to earn the electorate's trust was adopt PR. The experiment was not tried, although there was a last-minute fumble during the April 1992 campaign. Rest assured, if the PR card had been played properly it would have made little difference. Southerners would not have voted Liberal Democrat if they thought that the result would be a Labour government, alone or in coalition. Labour was not wanted, period. Mr Smith is aware of this, but insufficiently so. Labour's 'modernisers', of whom Mr Tony Blair is the outstanding example, know that what is required is a repositioning of the party in the political marketplace. This must mean severing formal ties with the trade unions, ditching the language of socialism from Labour's constitution, and, where principle permits, adopting a strategy of outflanking the Conservatives by attacking from the pro-competition, pro-consumer right. Mr Smith is a compromiser on the trade unions, indifferent to the argument about clause 4 of the party constitution (the one that implies renationalisation) and not always alive to the many opportunities that exist to dish the Conservatives with their own medicine. What Labour needs is a few pieces of theatre that break through the glass wall of resistance to politics. Mr Smith must establish a new picture of his party in the electorate's mind. For example, why not sue the government for failing to report the electricity generating duopoly to the monopolies and mergers commission? It would certainly get Labour's name in the papers. The chances are that a row over electoral reform will provide moments of drama; what remains to be seen is whether Mr Smith plays these to advantage. Lord Plant's commission on electoral reform, set up by Mr Kinnock, has voted by a narrow margin in favour of the 'supplementary vote' for elections to the commons. The second preferences of the also-rans in any constituency would be distributed among the two front-runners. In 1992 that might have returned most existing Labour MPs while throwing out a dozen or more Conservatives and putting Liberal Democrats in their place. The result would have been a hung parliament. The Plant proposals will go to Labour's national executive at the end of the month. If they are not thrown out there Mr Smith will find it difficult to avoid endorsing them. The party will then be called upon to do likewise at its conference in the autumn. Mr Smith's deputy, Mrs Margaret Beckett, may be relied upon to fight this all the way. She will have powerful allies. Reformers, perhaps led by Mr Robin Cook, will fight equally hard. The Labour boss can choose: either he acts as the soothing party manager, easing through the least disruptive package, or he stands on principle, staking his reputation on the result. He is likely to choose a neat way out. He will propose a referendum on the voting system, leaving it to the people to decide. That is a reasonable method of keeping the party united. A referendum would anyway be necessary before such an important constitutional change. Yet this device does nothing for the image of the leader or the party unless Mr Smith indicates how he himself will campaign and vote on the issue. Now for a succession of ifs. If Mr Smith makes a show of principle on fair voting for the Commons, and if Labour heavily promotes the rest of its package of constitutional reform (a PR-elected senate to replace the House of Lords, PR-elected regional assemblies and members of the European parliament, a Bill of Rights . . . ) it will have a package that would distinguish it from the Conservatives, attract some Liberals, and tempt a thin slice of voters from all other parties. We come at last to the biggest if of them all. If Mr Smith has correctly repositioned his party then all the constitutional reforms listed above would be a bonus that might tip the balance. If Labour is still seen as out-of-date, cloth-cap, the Woolworths party, the party of canals in the age of Cortinas, it will lose even if it offers a perfect electoral reform package to the accompaniment of praises sung by angels.</p>

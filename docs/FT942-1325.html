			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / UK Company News: High stock market activity helps ShareLink to Pounds 6.19m ShareLink Investment Services, the share dealing company which floated last July, almost doubled annual profits after a year of unusually high stock market activity. Immediate prospects, however, are more subdued. Pre-tax profits were Pounds 6.19m in the year to March 31, against Pounds 3.12m. The comparative figures have been prepared as if the group then existed in its present form. Turnover rose to Pounds 23.3m (Pounds 14.3m). It was bolstered by the third British Telecommunications privatisation issue, a more than doubling in the amount of personal equity plan funds under administration and rising subscriptions to information services. However, the company warned that trading volumes on the UK equity market had declined since February and that 'if these conditions were to persist throughout the current year, ShareLink's earnings would suffer'. Mr David Jones, the chief executive and biggest single shareholder, said, however: 'I don't think we'll see volumes go down. The only debate in ShareLink is when the upturn will take place.' The group announced that it was preparing moves into Europe and North America. Mr Jones talked of 'advance negotiations' but said there would be no immediate moves. He added that ShareLink was planning to enter mortgage broking and selling, although not with its own capital. ShareLink's immediate aim is the expansion of its services outside simple share transactions so that it reduces dependence on what can be a volatile stream of income. 'If we convert 20 per cent of gross turnover into fixed earnings, then we'd have 200,000 account holders and Pounds 1bn under administration,' Mr Jones said. Earnings per share rose to 26.11p (12.65p). A proposed final dividend of 6p brings the total for the year to 9p.</p>

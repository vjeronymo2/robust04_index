Among others, part 270 was removed. This order addresses eight requests for rehearing of the July 28, 1994 final rule. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Removal of Outdated Regulations Pertaining to the Sales of Natural Gas Production, 59 FR 40,240 (August 8, 1994), III FERC Stats. &amp; Regs.

That section included in the definition of first sale all sales by an affiliate of an interstate pipeline, intrastate pipeline, or local distribution company. Rehearing applicants contend that, as a result, the Commission has improperly deprived affiliated marketer sales of their status as deregulated first sales under the Wellhead Decontrol Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 2(21) of the NGPA defines a first sale. Sections 2(21) (A) (i)&hyph;(iv) and (B) set forth a general definition of a first sale that excludes sales of affiliates of inter- and intrastate pipelines and local distribution companies (LDCs) from the first sale definition unless the affiliate is selling gas it produced. However, section 2(21)(A)(v) grants the Commission authority to define, as a first sale, any sale that does not qualify under sections 2(21)(A) (i)&hyph;(iv) ``in order to prevent circumvention of any maximum lawful price established under this Act.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1979, in Order No. 58 implementing the NGPA, the Commission exercised its NGPA section 2(21)(A)(v) authority to define all sales by pipeline affiliates as first sales. That definition was set forth in 18 CFR 270.203(c). Specifically, &sect;270.203(c) provides that any sale by an affiliate of an interstate pipeline, intrastate pipeline, or LDC is a first sale under the NGPA unless the Commission determines not to treat it as such. The Commission explained that the reason for such treatment of affiliate sales was to prevent circumvention of the NGPA maximum lawful prices because otherwise an entity could avoid first sale treatment by becoming an affiliate of a pipeline. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Thus, although sales by interstate pipeline marketing affiliates generally would not qualify as first sales under NGPA sections (21) (A) (i)&hyph;(iv) and (B), they came to be defined as first sales by reason of &sect;270.203(c). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Final Rule Governing the Maximum Lawful Price for Pipeline Distributor or Affiliate Production, FERC Stats. &amp; Regs., Regulations Preambles 1977&hyph;1981 &para;30,101 at 30,722 (1979). Although Order No. 58 was overturned in Public Service Commission v. Mid-Louisiana Gas Co., 463 U.S. 319 (1983), the Commission continued the first sale status for affiliate sales in Order No. 391, FERC Stats. &amp; Regs., Regulations Preambles 1982&hyph;1985 &para;30,588 (1984). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act of 1989 repealed as of January 1, 1993, the entire Title I of the NGPA which contains the ceiling prices. However, the Decontrol Act did not remove nor modify NGPA section 2(21), including the authorization for the Commission to define as first sales those sales that would not otherwise qualify for such status. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Order No. 567 removed from the Commission's regulations certain natural gas regulations related to natural gas producer regulation that the Commission considered obsolete or nonessential in light of the decontrol of wellhead prices. These included the &sect;270.203(c) definition of a first sale. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On rehearing of Order No. 567, the petitioners urge the Commission to retroactively reinstate &sect;270.203(c). They argue that the removal of &sect;270.203(c) adversely affects marketing affiliates of interstate pipelines by placing them at a competitive disadvantage in relation to non-regulated non-affiliated marketers. They assert that the removal of the regulation means that affiliated marketer sales will no longer qualify as deregulated first sales under the Wellhead Decontrol Act and that they will become subject to Natural Gas Act (NGA) price and non-price regulation. They contend that the blanket marketer certificates that would apply under the NGA are not equivalent to deregulation and are always subject to change or termination by the Commission. They assert that treatment as non-regulated first sales is essential to continue fair competition among affiliated and non-affiliated marketers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the parties contend that the Commission has failed to satisfy the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by removing &sect;270.203(c) without public notice or opportunity to comment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

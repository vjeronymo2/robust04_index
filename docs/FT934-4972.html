			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Dawson Intl tumbles 41% to Pounds 9.2m - Interim dividend halved following poor performance at US fleece and jersey offshoot Dawson International, the Edinburgh-based textile company, cut its interim dividend by almost half as continuing problems in the US reduced pre-tax profits for the six months to September 25 by 41 per cent. Profits were Pounds 9.23m on turnover of Pounds 220.9m, compared with Pounds 15.5m on turnover of Pounds 210.7m. Earnings fell from 6.5p to 3.3p, and the interim dividend is cut from 2.9p to 1.5p. The shares fell 37p to 136p. Sir Ronald Miller, chairman, attributed the fall to extremely difficult markets for fleece and jersey garments - mainly T-shirts and sweatshirts - made by JE Morgan Apparel in the US. Losses there obscured good results from other businesses. Operating profit at the mainly US-based Dawson Consumer Products fell from Pounds 8.46m to Pounds 723,000. Turnover rose from Pounds 117.3m to Pounds 125m, but the latest figure included a benefit of almost Pounds 20m from foreign exchange movements. The company, which is closing four plants in the US, said that structural over-capacity in the sector and the need to hold stocks to meet changing demands from retailers had both built up stocks and hit margins. Losses on fleece and jersey had reached well into seven figures. Operating profits at Dawson Premier Brands, which includes Pringle and the luxury goods business, rose from Pounds 8.84m to Pounds 12.8m. But after allowing for the effect of currency translations, operating profits were flat. Turnover rose by 2.6 per cent to Pounds 95.8m. Mr Nick Kuenssberg, chief executive of the division, said Pringle was proving a main area for growth and now had 230 retail outlets. However, United Brands incurred an operating loss. Restructuring was taking longer than expected and some overseas markets were proving difficult. Interest payable rose from Pounds 1.78m to Pounds 4.29m. The increase was mainly accounted for by a rise of Pounds 1m payable on dollar-based loans, coupled with a Pounds 700,000 fall in interest received on European deposits. The remainder reflected higher levels of working capital. COMMENT It looks like the end of the American dream for Dawson. The harshly competitive environment in the US is likely only to get worse, and it would perhaps be better for the company to admit that it is too small a player in a rough game. The fundamental nature of US retailing has changed, and just-in-time delivery is forcing all suppliers to take the risk on stocks. The North American Free Trade Agreement has upped the ante with the threat of low labour cost plants in Mexico. The UK businesses look sound, but not exciting. The City, wary of more nasty surprises, has cut forecasts for the full year from Pounds 30m to as low as Pounds 18m. Until Dawson settles its US problems once and for all, the shares cannot realise their full potential.</p>

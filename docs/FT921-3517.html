			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / Management: Down at heel in Mayfair - Lucy Kellaway finds Lord Weinstock sharing the limelight with paintings of his prize-winning racehorses in an otherwise gloomy room Lord Weinstock sits slumped behind his desk. He does not get up when you come in. The office is dark, even though it is the middle of the afternoon. The dingy hanging blinds are drawn, spotlights pick out his desk and his prized paintings of racehorses on the walls. In between are pools of obscurity. The room is sweltering. The chief of the General Electric Company looks perfectly at ease in shirt-sleeves, but visiting businessman are expected to sweat into their jackets, perched on uncomfortable chairs. The headquarters of one of Britain's biggest industrial companies is so run down that it would put much smaller organisations to shame. Its ugly, modern box shape and dirty mixture of concrete, steel and glass - fashionable in the 1950s - are a blot on its Mayfair surroundings. The rounded lettering displaying the company's name and the dreary inside of the building do not seem to have been changed since GEC moved there in 1963. Upstairs on the chairman's floor, some of the flourescent corridor lights do not work, and the ceiling tiles are uneven. A ring of grease and dirt surrounds the button that calls the lift. Lord Weinstock cannot remember the last time his all-brown office was decorated. Even he agrees that enough is enough, and finally the building is to be redone. 'The place must be sufficiently bright not to depress people,' he says. A hint to the future is given by the ground floor waiting room which has recently had a face-lift with a cheap pink carpet and pink squashy sofas, which sit bleakly around the unadorned walls. Weinstock appears quite unbothered by the image that the building gets across. 'I'm not interested in image. We are what we are.' That is certainly true of Weinstock, an original, a manipulator, a chauvinist and a charmer. He does not abide by the conventions that bind the bosses of other companies. He gets into work at 9.30 or 10am and stays until late at night, locking the papers into his safe before going back to his London flat. 'Most of my life revolves around my job. It is what I am doing most of the time, wherever I am.' Even when he should be asleep, he lies awake thinking about work. He likes to be in command of his day, and only once a year - at budget time  -does he allow himself to tied down by formal meetings. 'I am not normally aware long in advance of what is in my diary,' he says. Inside the black volume, all the pages seem to be completely empty. 'This does not run my life', he says slamming it firmly shut. By contrast, both doors at either end of his office are wide open. Through one of them, Sarah Morrison, GEC's blue-stocking director of communications emerges, puts some papers on Weinstock's desk, and tells him something that she thinks is funnier than he does. His room makes few concessions to modernity. The old brown corduroy sofa and chairs are something to fill the space; Weinstock never leaves his 'nest' in the corner. There is no computer screen on his desk. 'If I want to know our share price, I can see it on this, a device which we invented.' He snatches up the remote control of his television and has some trouble getting it tuned to Teletext, and starts to shout. Eventually he manages it and calm returns. A more heavily used gadget is the telephone, on which he spends about a third of each day. He is quick to get on the phone himself, sometimes launching into a harangue before he has said who he is. Indeed, he has no fewer than 232 numbers on a short dial code, which are just the people who he speaks to often. Weinstock rejects the usual hierarchy within companies, and has no qualms about ringing up the manager of a small depot, getting him to explain himself if any complaints have made their way to head office. He has no personal staff, apart from a secretary and on his own admission, he is not much of a one for delegating. 'I don't delegate the jobs I am doing,' he says. 'If I can't do a part of a job, I delegate the thing to someone else.' Although Weinstock is a big family man, there are no pictures of his family around, indeed, no pictures of human beings at all. Instead he rattles off all the prizes won by his horses around the room, as well as the races they ought to have won. 'You have to have something on the walls and they are more beautiful than people,' he says.</p>

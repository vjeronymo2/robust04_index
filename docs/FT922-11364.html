			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Barclays chairman to stand down: Sir John Quinton told by directors on return from holiday to give up top jobs SIR JOHN QUINTON is being forced to quit next week as chief executive of Barclays, Britain's biggest bank, after pressure from its non-executive directors. He will stay on as chairman of the bank, but only until the beginning of next year. Details of his departure will be finalised at the next Barclays board meeting on Thursday. Later the same day Sir John, 62, is expected to tell shareholders at the bank's annual meeting that he will give up his post as chief executive to be replaced immediately by Barclays' managing director, Mr Andrew Buxton. Mr Buxton will take on the chairmanship as well when Sir John steps down. Unlike his predecessors among Barclays chairmen, Sir John will not remain on the board. Bankers say he feels he would be 'cramping the style' of his successor if he stayed. Sir John was confronted by the bank's non-executive directors three weeks ago, when he returned from a fortnight's holiday in Mauritius. They made it clear that he had to go. Bankers say Sir John had no idea that there was unhappiness with his performance at Barclays. The bank's non-executive directors include Sir Martin Jacomb, the bank's deputy chairman and a Bank of England director, Sir Nigel Mobbs, chairman of the property company Slough Estates, Sir Denys Henderson, chairman of Imperial Chemical Industries, and Sir James Spooner, chairman of the conglomerate Morgan Crucible. The Bank of England has been informed of the management changes. Sir John's departure is the most unexpected and sudden in a series of resignations involving senior directors at all of the UK's leading clearing banks over the past year. Last month, Mr Tom Frost stood down as chief executive of Barclays' main rival, National Westminster Bank. The non-executive directors are believed to have been persuaded that Barclays' approach to managing its huge business, which employs 111,400 people across the world, needed to be changed significantly. It was felt Sir John was too closely associated with the existing management style. Barclays' financial performance last year was worse than had been expected in the City, because its overheads rose more rapidly than those of its main rivals. In the current year, some of its big corporate customers, such as the property companies Heron International, Speyhawk and Olympia &amp; York, have run into difficulties. As a result, Barclays is likely to face big losses on loans to some of these companies. However, some Barclays executives, who are not on the board, questioned whether Mr Buxton was the best choice to replace Sir John. One senior banker pointed out that Mr Buxton was responsible for cost control as managing director. Mr Buxton's appointment would revert to a tradition that Barclays chairmen are drawn from the ranks of several families, which previously owned the regional banks bought by Barclays over the past 100 years. Sir John is not a member of the Barclays families. The Barclays board has not decided whether a new managing director should be appointed to replace Mr Buxton. Leading institutional shareholders said they had put no pressure on the board to make the changes. However, some of them have recently said they were unhappy with Barclays' performance. In 1988, they provided Barclays with Pounds 921m of new money in the form of a rights issue and they are upset that a large proportion has been used for lending to property companies.

			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FEAR AND REALITY  </P> <P> Your story was peppered with references to "Anglos." From my daily reading of  The Times, I assume you use this word to mean European-American (or its  shorthand equivalent, white) to denote people who are not Afro-American,  Asian-American, American Indian or Latino. If my reading is correct, you are  guilty of using a term that is imprecise at best and offensive at worst.  </P> <P> I can see two possible justifications for your use of Anglo. Anglo could either  refer to ethnic ancestry or to a mother tongue. In the first case, Anglo would  apply only to people with English ancestry and would be a misnomer when applied  (as in Times stories) to German-, Irish- and Hungarian-Americans and the many  other European-Americans with no English ancestry. In the second case, Anglo  would describe the majority of Asian-Americans and others of non-European  ancestry, contrary to your use of the term.  </P> <P> I am offended by your use of Anglo. On one hand, it negates my non-English  European ancestry, which includes one immigrant parent. I resent being called  Anglo just because I, like the children of many other immigrants, speak English  better than any other language. Furthermore, I have read in The Times that some  Latinos consider Anglo a derogatory term.  </P> <P> K. A. SCHMIDT, Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Engineers are urged to declare 'war on wear' A NATIONAL campaign being launched today is intended to save British manufacturing industry Pounds 1.5bn a year by encouraging greater awareness of one of engineering's more arcane 'ologies' - tribology, which is the study of friction, lubrication and wear. The Tribology Action Campaign, which comes with a self-help support package, telephone helpline and regional workshops aims to declare 'war on wear' and promote the application of the science across all areas of design, production and operation. The campaign, organised by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, is supported by the Department of Trade and Industry and sponsored by companies ranging from British Coal to RHP Bearings and Silkolene Lubricants. The aim is to reduce wear and tear in machinery through greater control of friction. The projected annual savings of Pounds 1.5bn come from improved efficiency through reduced energy, labour, maintenance and machinery costs. The Institution of Mechanical Engineers said additional benefits included reduced pollution and the potential to cut industrial energy consumption by up to 10 per cent a year. Mr Brian Halligan, campaign chairman and a member of the council of the institution, said research commissioned by the organisation showed 75 per cent of UK industry threw 'money down the drain' through lack of awareness. He added: 'UK industry spends Pounds 8bn a year on maintaining direct production assets. Yet, at any one time, 50 per cent of its machines are in need of attention.'</p>

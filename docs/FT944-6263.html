			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Tax): Landfill tax set for 1996 - Environment A tax on landfill was the most obviously 'green' proposal in the Budget. But the government will proceed cautiously before implementing a measure which could be unpopular with industry. Mr Clarke said that the tax would be introduced in 1996 and would raise several hundred million pounds a year. The tax would be collected by Customs and Excise, which means it would be added, like value added tax, to the cost of waste disposal. But to sweeten the pill, Mr Clarke made clear that the cost would be offset by other measures, such as a reduction in National Insurance contributions, meaning that its overall effect on industry would be neutral. Fuller details will be contained in a consultation document which will be published shortly. The tax would be levied on all waste going to landfill (licensed rubbish dumps). The purpose would be to make rubbish more expensive and encourage industry to minimise waste or recycle it. Mr Clarke said: 'In some cases, taxes actually do some good, by helping markets work better and by discouraging harmful or wasteful activ-ities.' Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, welcomed the proposal because it would add to a string of measures by government to deal with the waste problem. He stressed that the proposed offset meant that it was 'not fiscal, only environmental'. It was also welcomed by environmentalists. Mr Charles Secrett, director of Friends of the Earth, said this was 'the greenest Budget yet'. He particularly welcomed the chancellor's statement that a switch in taxation could discourage activities which damage the environment while helping cut the cost of employment. But industry was less enthusiastic. Mr John Cridland, environment director at the CBI, said that businessmen would need 'a cast-iron guarantee that this will not add to costs'. However, he welcomed the fact that government planned a period of consultation before going ahead with the measure. The National Association of Waste Disposal Contractors also took a cautious line. 'We are not convinced that this kind of measure will necessarily produce the promised environmental benefits,' said a spokesman. He pointed out that recent tightening of dumping regulations had already added to landfill costs, and any tax would come on top of that. A tax could also encourage illegal dumping. The UK produces about 140m tonnes of controlled waste each year of which about 100m tonnes goes into landfill. This is a higher proportion than most countries because the UK has relatively large landfill capacity and low landfill costs, ranging from Pounds 3 to Pounds 10 per tonne, depending on type. But landfill levies have been introduced in a growing number of countries such as Australia, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France and Germany. The issues for the UK are whether waste should be taxed by volume or value, and whether toxic wastes should be more highly taxed than other types. The level of the tax will also have to be decided, though judging by the chancellor's remarks it would be several pounds a tonne.</p>

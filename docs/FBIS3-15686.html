			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Galina Gridneva and </F> Aleksandr Kharchenko]    [Text] Dushanbe, 8 Mar -- It is now virtually impossible  for journalists to obtain objective information from official  sources about the situation in the former Kurgan-Tyube oblast.  In recent days, the sociopolitical situation in Kurgan-Tyube  and neighboring districts has become especially explosive.  Local observers believe that, in spite of all decisions taken  by the Dushanbe authorities on the disbanding and disarming of  various paramilitary groups, these groups do not intend to hand  over their weapons. Therefore, the possibility cannot be ruled  out that the Government of Tajikistan may resort to force within  the next few days as a way of resolving the conflict.    ITAR-TASS learned from military sources that the body of a  former field commander of the People's Front of Tajikistan,  Talat Mirusmanov, was discovered yesterday on the road linking  Kurgan- Tyube and Dushanbe. Until November last year he was  chief of staff of a special police unit deployed in  Kurgan-Tyube. Mirusmanov was shot by unknown gunmen. The  motive for the killing is being investigated by the republic's  law enforcement agencies. However, local observers do not rule  out the possibility that Talat Mirusmanov became the latest  victim of violence amongst various armed groups in the former  Kurgan-Tyube oblast. The Government of Tajikistan has virtually  no control over these groups. Ten people, including Mirzo  Saidov, chief of staff of a special Tajik defense ministry  brigade, and Zargorov, an employee of the international  nongovernmental organization, Medecins Sans Frontieres, have  already died in the violence during the past month.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The mutual payments for delivered and repaired  military equipment between the armed forces of Russia and  Belarus will be performed at prices set for the two countries'  own armies, Russian First Deputy Defense Minister Andrey  Kokoshin told a news conference in Minsk Thursday [16 June].    He said that according to a protocol signed with Belarussian  First Deputy Defense Minister Aleksandr Tushinskiy Thursday all  contracts between the two countries' military enterprises will  be concluded directly, without mediators. This will enable both  countries to significantly reduce their military expenditures.    For his part, Tushinskiy pointed to the importance of the  agreement to start bilateral consultations on the utilization of  components of the fuel used for surface-to-air missiles and  bombs. At present, Belarus lacks its own technologies and  equipment for this, Tushinskiy said.    Representatives of the two countries' commands supported the  creation of joint military enterprises and financial and  industrial groups to manufacture a wide range of products.</p>

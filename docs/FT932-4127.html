			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Soros helps the D-Mark down THE D-Mark weakened against the dollar and most European currencies yesterday after dealers were impressed by a comment from Mr George Soros, the foreign exchange operator, that the German currency was in the throes of long-term weakness, writes James Blitz. The timing of Mr Soros's comments, in yesterday's Times, helped to concentrate minds on the fertile issue of the D-Mark's potential weakness. Earlier in the week, the peseta's recovery in the wake of Mr Felipe Gonzalez's general election victory had helped to quell tensions in the European exchange rate mechanism - again lifting the veil on the weak economic fundamentals that underlie the D-Mark. By Tuesday night in Europe, when Mr Soros's comments appeared, the market was gearing itself up for another round of concerted selling of the German currency. The D-Mark dropped as low as DM1.6420 against the dollar in Europe, later closing at DM1.6380, nearly 1 1/2 pfennigs down on the day; in New York the dollar ended at DM1.6350. In London, the D-Mark opened 2 pfennigs weaker against sterling at DM2.4849. The pound still ended 1 3/4 pfennigs up from its previous close, at DM2.4825, in spite of public criticism of Mr John Major's government by his former chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont. Inside the ERM, the D-Mark dropped to minus 16 percentage points on its divergence indicator, although it has been as low as minus 23 in recent times. The French franc looked powerful, closing at FFr3.363 per D-Mark, up from FFr3.368. However, there was no reason to think that the German currency had broken below strategic barriers in yesterday's moves. The dollar has traded in a range of DM1.5630 to DM1.6730 all year. Yesterday's close roughly matched the one for the first trading day of 1993. Nor was Mr Soros clearly planning a concerted strategy against the German currency. He admitted yesterday that he was talking his own book. But, in the view of one London dealer yesterday, a serious investor does not talk his book in public. The potential weakness of the D-Mark clearly worries the Bundesbank. The repo rate, with which funds are supplied to banks, was yesterday left unchanged at a lowest accepted level of 7.60 per cent. A battle is developing between a market that wants to sell the D-Mark and a central bank that wants its value to be maintained. Sterling's performance surprised some dealers. The pound should have been undermined by political unrest in Westminster and by suspected Bank of England selling of the currency. But the outlook for the dollar and D-Mark looks uncertain and some dealers wonder whether the yen's rise has run its course. So, the pound, whose country has a positive growth rate and few inflation worries, might look attractive.</p>

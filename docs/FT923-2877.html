			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Airbreak falls Pounds 2.9m into red AIRBREAK LEISURE Group, the USM-quoted tour operator, yesterday announced a fall into losses for the six months to June 30 and warned that the full-year outcome would be significantly below expectations. Mr David Lewis, chairman, said that he was resigning as a consequence of the anticipated disappointing results, as was Mr M Linton, the finance director. The news came out after the market closed, when the company's share price was 24p, down 1 1/2 p. The pre-tax losses amounted to Pounds 2.92m on turnover of Pounds 22.7m. At the time of the annual meeting in June, Mr Lewis said he had been 'encouraged by the strong trend of advance bookings' and the 'firm prices' of the company's holidays. However, since June, the market had sharply deteriorated, resulting in 'substantial discounting' hitting the charter tour market. Airbreak was forced to cut its planned flying programme by some 65,000 seats. In addition, the company had problems at Sunsail International, which provides sailing and club holidays in the Mediterranean. Airbreak acquired Sunsail for up to Pounds 8m in shares and loan stock in January. Mr Lewis alluded to 'unexpected problems' in two of Sunsail's associated companies and to 'wholly unanticipated demands for repayments of existing and long-established overdraft facilities from Sunsail's two principal bankers'. Consequently, large amounts of Airbreak's cash had had to be 'utilised', resulting in cashflow difficulties. Airbreak planned to sell Sunsail and had received a cash offer. Mr Lewis said that a restructuring of the board would follow the resignations, accompanied, he hoped, by a further cash investment. Losses per share came to 7.18p.</p>

			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> DAVIS' 26 POINTS LEAD MORNINGSIDE GIRLS TO 69-61 VICTORY OVER LYNWOOD  </P> <P> Janet Davis hasn't made anyone forget Lisa Leslie yet, but the Morningside High  center posted Leslie-like numbers Wednesday night to lead the girls' basketball  team to its biggest victory of the young season.  </P> <P> Davis, a 6-foot-4 junior, had 26 points, 11 rebounds and nine blocked shots as  Morningside defeated visiting Lynwood, 69-61, in the championship game of the  Morningside Tournament.  </P> <P> Davis was named tournament most valuable player.  </P> <P> The Lady Monarchs (5-0) broke open a close game in the last four minutes.  Sophomore forward Tina Thompson, who finished with 12 points and seven  rebounds, hit a basket to break a 56-56 tie and later sank a three-point shot  that put the game away.  </P> <P> Senior guard Princess Murray, who has been slowed by a shoulder injury, also  played well down the stretch for Morningside. She finished with five points and  six assists.  </P></p>

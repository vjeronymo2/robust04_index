There are two options. According to the first one, Russian  counterintelligence will be renamed the Federal Directorate of  Investigations and will be part of the Justice Ministry, as in  America.    The second option calls for the transfer of the former KGB  under the control of the president. In both cases Russian  counterintelligence may lose its status as an independent  federal body and may simply become a subdivision of either one  or the other state directorate.    Some analysts see in the proposed reform an attempt by  interested parties, including foreign ones, to finally lower the  status of Russia's state security structures. According to the  source, the appointment of the head of the Federal Service of  Counterintelligence, who will most probably be Sergey Stepashin,  will be announced at the same time as a decree about the  reorganization of the former KGB.</p>

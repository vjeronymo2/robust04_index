			<p>BFN     [Text] Wuhan, June 29 (XINHUA) -- A major Chinese  "food-and-clothing" project, launched five years ago, has made  great strides in helping poor areas develop more profitable  farming ways.    The Chinese Government launched the project in 1989 in 17  provinces or autonomous regions, including Sichuan, Shanxi,  Gansu, Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, Ningxia, Hebei, Hubei, Hunan,  Guizhou and Yunnan.    It is designed to help poor mountainous counties to apply a  new farming technique: Growing hybrid maize with heat-retaining  plastic sheets covering the ground.    The new farming technique was introduced from Japan in 1978  by the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture. It helps to increase  the temperature of the earth, keeps fertilizer in place and  prevents soil erosion and water losses. The system has been  dubbed "the white revolution" or "silver revolution," and it is  highly suitable for cold mountain zones.    It has now been applied to more than 3.79 million hectares  in  483 counties, benefiting 33 million farmer households with a  total of 135 million people.    The technique has raised the per hectare output of corn by  2,511 kilograms, which represents a 56.4 kg increase in per  capita grain output in the project areas.    "This white revolution has brought about a profound change  in  the cultivation mode in the mountain areas," an official of the  Chinese Agriculture Ministry said.    In the past, only maize was grown in the fields, and now  vegetables and wheat flourish there too.    The "food-and-clothing " project has not only helped  villagers to solve their food problem, but also assisted them in  learning and using advanced agricultural techniques, he said.    To help the project along, the Chinese Government sends  agricultural scientists and technicians to the project areas to  work with the local farmers. The necessary materials and  equipments are also supplied.    By the end of last year, the project areas had also  developed  333,333 hectares of farmland for other cash crops, such as tea,  fruit trees and walnut trees, and vegetable-growing.    The per capita annual income in the areas has reached 498  yuan, 120 yuan more than in 1988.    People living below the poverty line in those areas have  been  cut to three million, from the previous seven million.    In the five years, more than 288,000 technical training  courses have been held in the project areas. Some 36.01 million  people have attended the courses.    The project has cost some 1.1 billion yuan (about 130  million  U.S. dollars).</p>

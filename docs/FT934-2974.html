			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / International Company News: Canadian banks go their different ways - A report on the disparate results produced under the same conditions It's hard to believe a group of companies in the same country doing much the same kind of business can produce such disparate financial results as Canada's big banks have in their latest fiscal year. The six banks' return on equity for the year to October 31 ranged from a low of 2.4 per cent at Royal Bank of Canada to a middling 9.9 per cent at Montreal-based National Bank to Bank of Nova Scotia's impressive 14.4 per cent. While Bank of Montreal's loan-loss provisions grew by 23 per cent to CDollars 675m (USDollars 510m), Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce reported a drop of almost 50 per cent to CDollars 920m. 'I can't easily recall - except for the time of LDC provisioning - when there was less comparability between banks,' says Mr Robin Korthals, Toronto-Dominion's president. If the stock market is any guide, the one common thread in the banks' performance is that business prospects are improving after three years of spiralling loan losses and slack credit demand. Bank of Nova Scotia's share price has risen by 27 per cent on the Toronto stock exchange this year. Despite its lacklustre performance, Royal Bank's shares have jumped from CDollars 24.62 to CDollars 28. Ms Donna Toth, analyst at Nesbitt Thomson in Toronto, says her firm has the bank sector at the top of its list of recommendations. The optimism is based on early signs that the banks' non-performing loan portfolios are starting to shrink as economic recovery takes hold. With the banks' prime lending rate at 5.5 per cent, its lowest level in 30 years, investors are banking on a revival in credit demand. Ms Toth adds that dividend yields are attractive. Mr Korthals takes a more cautious view, predicting that credit demand will be 'anaemic' for at least the next six months and stiff competition will continue to compress margins. He says: 'Borrowing is predicated on anticipation of price movement more than economic activity.' Although the North American recovery is gathering steam, inflation remains low. The wide disparity in 1993 earnings is partly explained by various charges and recoveries, whose size and timing is largely a matter of discretion. Several banks cushioned the impact on their income statements of loan losses in the hard-hit North American real estate and natural resource sectors by reversing provisions made during the 1980s on loans to then-troubled Third World borrowers, mostly in Latin America. Toronto-Dominion and Royal were hit by charges to cover the cost of integrating the operations of recently-acquired trust companies. But their accounting treatment varies. Toronto-Dominion set aside CDollars 140m as a special item for its purchase of Central Guaranty Trust, which involved closing 90 branches of the now-defunct trust company. Royal's takeover of Royal Trust will mean closing only 43 branches. But it charged CDollars 300m against fourth-quarter earnings, in the form of a non-interest expense. The writedown will probably enable the bank to report a huge improvement in next year's earnings, which Ms Toth estimates at CDollars 3.08 per share, up from 46 cents in 1993. The banking industry is buzzing with rumours that a good performance in 1994 will clear the way for Mr Allan Taylor to step down as Royal's chief executive. The banks' divergent performances may continue for several years as each responds in its own way to regulatory reforms and fast-changing markets. 'They all looked like one big homogenous glob in the 1980s,' says Ms Kathy Humber, analyst at Wood Gundy. 'They are now starting to differentiate themselves.' Royal, Bank of Nova Scotia and Toronto-Dominion have all snapped up trust companies this year to broaden their exposure to the 'wealth management' services, which are expected to be in increasing demand from an ageing population. Bank of Montreal has eschewed this strategy in favour of building on the trust business of its Chicago-based subsidiary, Harris Bankcorp. It contends that Canadian banks do not need more branches, and that much of the trust companies' business is no different from the banks. Bank of Montreal is also the odd man out in the banks' recent rush into insurance. Its attitude - at least for the time being - is that it can add little value to an insurance company, and that bank branches cannot easily handle the sale of insurance policies. Mr Anthony Comper, Bank of Montreal's president, says that his bank's main growth areas will include Harris' retail network, North American investment banking and US corporate business. In five years' time, 'we will be significantly bigger in the US than now', he says. The other banks are also keen to make a splash in the US and Latin America, especially Mexico. The three which have recently bought trust companies, however, may have their hands full in Canada for the time being.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CANADIAN BANKS - YEAR TO OCTOBER 31 1993  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                        Assets        Net income                                    (CDlrs bn)         (CDlrs m)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Royal Bank of Canada            164.9 (138.3)         300 (107) CIBC                            141.3 (132.2)          730 (12) Bank of Montreal                116.9 (109.0)         709 (640) Bank of Nova Scotia              107.6 (98.2)         714 (676) Toronto-Dominion                  85.0 (74.1)         275 (408) National Bank of Canada           42.7 (40.0)           175 (1)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                     Loan loss             Return on                          provisions (CDlrs m)            equity (%)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Royal Bank of Canada            1,750 (2,050)    2.4 (negative 0.3) CIBC                              920 (1,835)   10.6 (negative 2.0) Bank of Montreal                    675 (550)           14.1 (14.1) Bank of Nova Scotia                 465 (449)           14.4 (15.7) Toronto-Dominion                    600 (543)             5.4 (8.4) National Bank of Canada             325 (570)    9.9 (negative 2.6)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1992 figures in parentheses  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by leader Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi to Benghazi </F> citizens; date not given -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] We will not be taken for a  ride, and we will not be trifled with another time. We have  prepared, and training with weapons is taking place day and  night for youths and old people and men and women. We are ready  for confrontation in order to defend our right to live in peace,  in freedom, and in pride on our land.    O brothers, we have to get ready now with one hand carrying  weapons and the other having to carry the instruments for  construction and production. We have, O brothers, to move now  toward doing without the goods of the enemy, the equipment of  the enemy. We must close our markets to the goods of the  enemies. We must punish them economically as they have done to  us and defy them as they have defied us and declare to them our  determination that we will resist regardless of the  circumstances. [passage omitted]    We must not underestimate the anger of the Libyan people and  the people's revolt being carried out by the Libyan people these  days, and we must not underestimate the factors that have led to  the Libyan people's anger and revolt these days in all parts of  the free Libyan land. There is an infringement of which the  Libyan people are aware, and the Western alliance has gone  beyond the limits, crossed the red lines, and has blatantly  interfered in peoples' internal affairs in the name of the  United Nations--after they have killed the United Nations and  replaced it with themselves. [passage omitted]    We have offered several olive branches and have told them:  We  befriend whoever shows friendship to us. We have tried through  peaceful means and through all mediation and means and put  forward all proposals to solve any dispute between us and the  Western states because we do not want peace to be threatened in  the Mediterranean Sea or North Africa. We do not want new  collapses to take place in the Arab region.    They know that the Libyan system, which is based on direct  people's democracy, is the safety valve in North Africa and the  Arab homeland. Consequently, they do not want a safety valve  in the Arab homeland. They want to remove all safety valves so  that the Arab homeland blows up and collapses. They are now  working day and night to destroy Egypt on your eastern borders  and Algeria on your western borders. They destroyed Iraq before  that, and now the conspiracies are being hatched against Sudan,  Syria, and Libya. [passage omitted]    We will not forget this Western beast that is lying in wait  across the sea. O brothers, we will not be betrayed once more.  There is no friendship at all between us and those enemies.  They wanted enmity, so let it be enmity between us and them  until doomsday. We are separated from them by trenches and  barricades.    O brothers, they want to destroy peoples by depriving them  of  their resources, but we in Libya are not disturbed as others  whose oil has become worth less than the price of water.    We welcome the deterioration of oil prices because we want  to  get rid of oil, and we Libyans want to get used to living  without oil. Every day when the price of oil tumbles, we clap  and thank God. We want the price of oil to tumble until it  reaches nothing because they have decided to subjugate the  Libyan people using oil. They said the wound that would hurt  Libya was oil. They said the will of the Libyan people depended  on oil. They said the Libyan people would give up their  sovereignty and independence for oil.    They based all their calculations on oil. You have to pay  attention to this fact. It is the enemies who are plotting so  that Libya's revolutionary and stubborn position and its defense  of its pride depended on oil. If the West deprived Libya of  oil, the Libyan people would surrender. The Libyan people would  be vanquished, would forget their pride and independence,  enabling the West to step into their homes, to desecrate them,  and to take them into bondage and put them on the list of those  who have surrendered.    O free Libyan people, we have to understand this fact. We  have to make decisions now as if we are without oil. We have to  decide to live in ease as if we have no oil since the enemy has  based all his calculations and plots on depriving us of oil to  subjugate us.    What is required, brothers, is that even if oil production  is  not cut off, even if they do not besiege the oil, even if they  cannot do without Libyan oil, we must make provisions and  prepare ourselves. From now on, we must decide to live without  oil. We must educate ourselves individually and at the family  level to live without oil. But, brothers, we cannot live without  independence. We would die for independence. We cannot live  without dignity, honor, and pride on the land of our fathers and  ancestors. [passage omitted]    [passage omitted] We challenge them to talk about human  rights to Germany or Japan. They only talk about human rights  to you--the small, weak, and downtrodden peoples. Consequently,  these peoples must expose this falsification--this false  language and this international hypocrisy. This is a new  international hypocrisy and a new international decline behind  which are economic and military forces.    Small peoples must only get ready for confrontation. There  is nothing in front of them but relentless fighting for their  independence, sovereignty, and resources. There is nothing in  front of peoples but defense--with all their forces and by  getting ready to wage a long battle in order to safeguard the  resources, children, independence, sovereignty, and freedom on  their land. The long battle is not in the interest of the  enemies. They want a short battle and a terrorist one. They  want to terrorize us with missiles or aircraft, their bombs or  their empty threats.    Brothers, they only want to terrorize us. They want a short  battle where we will be intimidated by them, fear them, submit  to them, surrender oil, ourselves, our land, our heritage, our  future, and the future of our children and grandchildren to  them. We must resolve to face up to them and prepare for a  long battle, with perseverance and unparalleled patience and  courage. [passage omitted]    The peoples of the Arab nation are imprisoned and tied up.  They cannot go out to the streets and squares. Brothers,  repression and suppressing the breeze of freedom will not  prevent peoples from engaging in revolution. On the contrary,  the stronger the repression, oppression, and suppression of the  breeze and the sun of freedom, the more revolutionary people  become. The revolution is coming. The Arab nation is now  called upon to engage in revolution to save itself and its  future.    The Arab nation is exposed to danger these days, brothers.  Palestine has been sold in an auction sale, and so was  Jerusalem. Egypt is being destroyed on orders from the western  forces. What is happening in Egypt is a conspiracy to destroy  the biggest Arab state, and what is happening in Algeria is a  conspiracy by France and the western states in order to  undermine the Algerian revolution and the second or third  largest Arab state. Iraq was destroyed and divided while the  Arab nation was watching and listening. Iraq's destruction was  also a western conspiracy. The West had ordered Iraq to occupy  Kuwait, promising to back this occupation. When Iraq occupied  Kuwait, the West destroyed and divided Iraq. [passage omitted]    They are bent on putting an end to the Arab nation, and they  want a Jewish empire to be set up on your ruins. O Arabs, you  must know this: A Zionist empire is coming from the Ocean to  the Gulf, and not from the Euphrates to the Nile. [passage  omitted]    Brothers, the Middle East problem will be solved when the 7  million Palestinian people return their land of Palestine, when  Jerusalem is the capital of the Palestinian state, when we see  on the map the democratic state of Palestine--not Israel, or  Jacob, or Yitzhaq. The Middle East problem will be resolved  when the Zionist entity is disarmed of its arms of mass  destruction directed at every Arab state. Brothers, how can we  recognize an alien state in the heart of the Arab homeland and  armed with arms of mass destruction? [passage omitted]    O brothers, I am giving you facts and exposing the enemies'  plans. This is what had been missing in 1911. We did not know  anything about the plans of the European countries. We did not  know the plan of the Italians. [passage omitted]    Today, I am here before you to expose the plans of these  enemies, to expose the so-called international legitimacy, and  to expose the so-called peace process in the Middle East. I am  explaining the (?dangerous) conspiratorial plan against the Arab  nation. This is not taking place against Libya only--but  against Egypt, Algeria, Iraq, and Somalia. Egypt's turn will  come after Iraq. They have destroyed Iraq quickly with military  might. However, because of different conditions in Egypt and  Iraq, they are now endeavoring to destroy Egypt through a long  war of attrition aimed at finishing Egypt. The same plan that  existed in the days of Jamal 'Abd al- Nasir is still being  implemented on the Egyptian land.    The same is taking place in Algeria. It is a war of  attrition carried out by the black French hand to bring Algeria  to its knees and destroy it.    Then the turn of Libya and Syria will come. They believe  that Libya's turn came before Egypt. This is a mistake. They  started in Egypt before Libya. A war of attrition has been  waged internally against Egypt. Orders to wage a war of  attrition and to carry out operations near Egypt come from  Germany, France, Britain, and America.    We say to those who believe that Libya is in danger that  Egypt and Algeria are in a more dangerous situation than Libya.  Libya is not in a dangerous situation yet. It has awakened and  started preparing itself for confrontation. Libya will not be  taken by surprise. First, it should cease its dependency on oil  and move toward production. The people should be united with  purified ranks to remove any breaches that will enable the enemy  to infiltrate our ranks, brothers. [passage omitted]    These acts appear to be perpetrated internally by Islamic  terrorist elements. This is wrong. This is the work of western  intelligence inside Egypt.    What is happening in Egypt appears to be an Islamic,  terrorist action from inside. This is not true. This is the  action of western intelligence inside Egypt. Egypt is in danger  before Libya. What is happening in Algeria is not the work of  the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front] as they believe. This is the  plot of the French black hand, and behind it are the western  states. [passage omitted]    Libya is luckier and in good shape because, on the one hand,  Libya has awakened. On the other hand, it is because Libya has  a free people capable of taking to public squares and streets.  They are a unified people consisting of one family because the  Libyan people reject treason, eliminate treason in their ranks.  They are trained to carry arms. [passage omitted]    O brothers, I incite you to confrontation and to get ready  for the confrontation. The battle has not yet happened, but I  tell you that this confrontation and this battle must be long.  We must prepare for it so that we can make it last. If it is  long, we will triumph. If we show fear, shake, or become  terrorized from day one, we will lose the battle forever. We  will become slaves forever, and they will take all our wealth  and your wives and houses as they did in the past. They will  not take anything into consideration and will never have any  mercy on you.    I tell you brothers: Do not be afraid. Do not be  frightened. Do not tremble. Do not be intimidated. Do not fear  them. If the battle is long and led with patience and courage,  we will triumph in the end, and we will defeat the enemies. The  enemy is gambling. It is seeking a quick gain without a loss.  Your enemy is a tradesman, a capitalist seeking a market,  wealth, gold, silver, the resources of peoples. [passage omitted]    Your enemy is a greedy capitalist seeking markets, who wants  to use the power of a capitalist state, political power, and  military power to subjugate you, so that markets are opened up  for his products and consumer goods afterwards, and so that you  may become a consumer market for the products of Western states.  [passage omitted]    Do you want to have the same fate as that of the Somali  people? Do you want the same fate as the fate of the Algerian  people? Do you want to have the same fate as the Iraqi people?  Therefore, we must prepare ourselves beginning now. This enemy  will not retreat if we say to it: Peace be upon you; we want  peace, and we want friendship. [passage omitted]    What mistake was made by the Libyan people? What threat to  peace was made by the Libyan people? What crime was committed  by the Libyan people? They do not have any evidence, any  response. They have been exposed even over the Lockerbie issue.  They have bowed their heads before the world, after  organizations not belonging to a state and without a political  entity have been accused.    It might have been perpetrated by a thug, and what would the  Security Council do if they discovered that a terrorist such as  Carlos had blown up the airliner over Lockerbie? What would the  Security Council do with Article 7 in the face of Carlos. What  if it is proved that a secret, stateless organization had blown  up the Pan Am plane? What a predicament the Security Council is  finding itself in now that it has been exposed. Look at the  farce. This shows that the United Nations is finished, that the  UN Charter is finished, that the Security Council is finished.  It has now become the Western Security Council. The United  Nations has become the Western United Nations against the small  people. This is clear.    O brothers, I wish that good language, signs of friendship,  and exchanges of interests between us and them would protect us  from their evils. No, no, whatever you do, it is useless.    It is enough that we told France that we wanted to solve its  case. Even the Libyan suspects in the UTA case themselves  announced that they were prepared to stand trial in a French  court if investigations were carried out with them first and  proved that they needed to stand trial. The Libyan suspects  announced it to the world and said they were prepared to be  interrogated, and if investigations proved that they had to  stand trial in France, they--such-and-such a person--were  prepared to go.    Why has not France responded to that? France refused to  solve its problem with Libya. That French position is against  the Security Council, against the United Nations. How can the  Security Council decide that Libya did not respond to the  demands by the French investigating judge and that Libya must  submit to the French requests? When Libya said: Let us respond  to that investigation and even the suspects themselves said so,  France refused to carry out the investigation so that it would  not be humiliated. France refused to solve its problem with  Libya.    We announce to the world: France refuses to solve its  problem with Libya in support of its allies and sisters, America  and Britain. How can the Arab countries not stick together? I  am not talking about the people. The Arab peoples are wholly  with us, but why is the stance of Arab governments not like that  of the French Government? [passage omitted]    We want Arab governments to stand with their brothers, the  Libyan people, as France did with its British and American  brothers and governments. The Arab peoples are with us, are  united with us, and are standing with us. I am not speaking of  the people because they are poor, subjugated, tied up, or  helpless. No Arab peoples can come out into a square like this.  Governments are afraid of the masses, of the challenge by the  masses, of the masses coming out to express support for the  Libyan people. We challenge Arab governments to allow the  masses of the Arab nation to go out to the squares and streets  to express to the West that they are one Arab people, one Arab  nation, one Arab cause, and have one enemy.    I, O brothers, am exposing to you the enemies' plot, the new  international order that we must be aware of and in which  friendship is useless. If you surrender, they will say: Why  did you surrender? You have surrendered, now give me your oil.  [passage omitted]    Even if you get an agent and tell him to come and rule Libya  and get rid of the problem with the West, it will not work.  Why? Because the West will tell him: Since you are an agent  and you rule Libya, hand over the oil and the Libyan soil to set  up bases, as well as the Libyan people to make them slaves, and  political power and sovereignty.    That is what would happen. Therefore, why should you use an  agent. Would you accept an agent to hand you over to America to  solve your problem with the West? It would not work. It would  not work. It is useless, of course. No, a thousand no's. The  enemy is not shy. The enemy is scared, scared only of a  confrontation. [passage omitted]</p>

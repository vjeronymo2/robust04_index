			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Jaipur, January 3--The Prime Minister, Mr P.V.  Narasimha Rao, today expressed fear that in the liberalised  post-GATT scenario, crucial technologies may be withheld from  India to stunt her progress in various fields.    This was in spite of the fact that the new GATT deal  ensuring  further opening up of national economies and erosion of national  borders as a consequence of internationalisation of business,  innovation and technological development, he said.    "Yet, I foresee emergence of such trends and building of  protectionist walls, said the Prime Minister while inaugurating  the 81st session of the Indian Science Congress at Rajasthan  University here. "However, I have full faith in the genius of  Indian economists, scientists and technologists and the people  to get around such problems."    In his 40-minute speech, devoted mainly to stress the  importance of technology in the post-GATT (General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade) world environment, Mr Rao said though the new  global agreement on ensuring free trade would affect many  fields, its impact would be high only in some key areas.    Identifying these areas as textiles and clothing,  agriculture, trade-related intellectual property rights (TRIPs)  and services, including research and development services, he  said such sectors required a strong base in indigenous R and D  and science and technological capabilities.    "With our vast reservoir of S and T personnel and  comparatively lower manpower costs, it was possible to meet such  challenges through appropriate R and D inputs. To make this  happen, industry has to play a dominant part," Mr Rao stressed,  referring to the successful examples of industrialised nations.    However, private industry contributed less than 15 per cent  of national R and D investments. This should change, said the  Prime Minister, and industry should come forward to define the  goal areas and set targets for the scientific community.    While creation of wealth was important, it ws even more  crucial to ensure its equitable distribution, said Mr Rao. He  attributed increasing social tensions to the perpetuation  inequity in economic development. Quoting a Sanskrit verse, he  said prosperity for all should the purpose of our developmental  programmes.    Referring to the theme of this session, "Science in India:  excellence and accountability," he said he shall not judge the  performance of scientists in terms of conventional yardsticks  that are used to assess productivity. It will be left to  scientists' own methods of judgment.    At the same time, there can be no judgment according to  which  concrete results were ignored. He quoted noted scientist Prof S.  Chandrasekhar to stress this point: "One's place in science, as  posterity will duly assign, depends largely on one's continuous  exertion, at the edge of one's ability.    Deftly side-stepping issues of declining government  investment in the R and D sector and allocations for the  educational institutions voiced by the scientific community, the  Prime Minister said industry should step up investments in  universities too and also ensure involvement of high quality  manpower in programmes of their interest.    Prof P.N. Srivastva, in his presidential speech, regretted  "complete neglect of the education of science" and doubted  India's competence to compete with other countries.    He asked the science administrators and policy-makers to  ponder as to how the expectations and aspirations of the people  were going to be achieved if science education continued to be  neglected.    Quoting recommendations of senior scientists made to the  government in 1990, Prof Srivastva regretted programmes to  provide excellence in science education by establishing  consortia of universities to work in collaboration with higher  institutions of learning and utilising their superior human and  material resources were not initiated.    He suggested at least ten per cent of the science and  technology budget should be embarked for training of manpower in  universities and colleges. The scientific activities of the UGC  [University Grants Commission] should be supported by various  concerned agencies and the departments of science and  technology. Proper improvement will have to be made in primary  and secondary schools as well. "If we do not do this, we will  only be strengthening the tip of the pyramid, whose bottom is  weak. In such a situation, we will never be able to compete with  the world in the 21st century," Prof Srivastva cautioned.    The chief minister, Mr Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, asked the  scientists to suggest ways to solve the problem of drinking  water in Rajasthan. The governor, Mr Baliram Bhagat, also said  Rajasthan was [a] rain deficient state having two major  rivers--Chambal and Mahi. Scientists should help the policy  makers in overcoming water shortage in the state. The Union  minister of state for science and technology, Mr Bhuwanesh  Chaturvedi, the Rajasthan minister for science and technology,  Mr Lalit Kishore Chauturvedi, also spoke on the occasion.    Prof U.R. Rao, director of the Bangalore-based ISRO, [Indian  Space Research Organization], was elected president of the next  session of the science congress.    The Prime Minister today awarded nine Indian scientists for  outstanding work in science and technology at the opening  ceremony, adds PTI [Press Trust of India].    Dr A.S. Paintal of Delhi was presented the Asutosh  Mookherjee  Memorial Award for his work in medical research.    Dr M.S. Narasimham, who is associated with the international  centre for theoretical physics, Italy, was presented the C.V.  Raman birth centenary award for his research in mathematics.    The Srinivasa Ramanujan birth centenary award was bagged by  Prof R.P. Bambah of Punjab University in mathematics.    Other recipients include Dr Hari Narain, who bagged the M.N.  Shah birth centenary award in earth science and Prof P.V.  Sukhatme who got the P.C. Mahalanobis birth centenary award.    While Prof A.K. Sharma received the J.C. Bose award for  1993-94 in citogenetics and cell biology, the P.C. Ray award for  1993-94 was given to Prof C.N.R. Rao in the field of solid state  chemistry.    Dr K.C. Binsal and Dr S.L. Kothari, jointly shared the Prof  Hiran Lal Chakravarty award in the field of botany.    After the awards presentation, the Union minister of state  for science and technology, Mr B. Chaturvedi, released a book on  Science in India, Excellence and Accountability. Mr Bhagat also  released a book titled Indian Science, A Selected Bibliography.</p>

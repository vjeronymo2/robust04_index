			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Edmond Laci report: "Beatings Accompany the New Greek </F> `Cleanup'"]    [Text] Kapshtice -- Albanian refugees forcibly repatriated  by the Greek authorities are making chilling allegations. Only  one week after the harsh statement by the Albanian Foreign  Ministry condemning the murder of a young Albanian by Greek  border guards, many Albanian refugees expelled in the last few  days tell of inhuman crimes committed against them. After an  interruption in the mistreatment and mass expulsions of  Albanians, the Greek authorities embarked on a new "cleanup"  campaign on 29 March. Most of the 1,600 Albanians returned on  that day -- at a time when the average number of returnees  amounts to 200 refugees per day -- have testified to the  Albanian border authorities that they were tortured and even  obscenely baited. The statement by the Human Rights Union  deputy in the Albanian parliament on 30 March, protesting  against the police who, according to him, prevented the [Greek]  minority from celebrating 25 March, the anniversary of the Greek  Revolution of 1821, has compounded the most recent  Greek-Albanian incident.    About 1,000 refugees returned at the Kapshtice border  crossing immediately on reaching Albanian soil spoke of  previously unheard-of crimes. This contingent had fallen prey  to the special police of Kostouri, in whose cells more than 30  refugees were kept for four or five days without food of any  kind. The most chilling tales include cases of the rape of  Albanian girls by Greek soldiers, even before the eyes of other  men who were in detention alongside them. Meanwhile, other  victims of this terror confirmed at the border other cases of  extreme torture such as the use of electric shocks on their  bodies. The contingent returned on 29 March also confirmed to  the Albanian authorities that they had left dozens of other  mistreated Albanians at Kostouri, one of them in serious  condition. The baiting of the Greek soldiers with the words,  "Whose is Macedonia?" often involved beatings with rubber  truncheons. Drachmas and food were also confiscated, and  passports with valid visas for their bearers were also torn up.    This raises once again tensions between Albania and Greece  at  the very time when matters appeared to be reverting to normal.  Greece's turn as EU chairman and the recent visit of high-level  Greek Foreign Ministry officials to Tirana had given new  positive signals not only for interstate relations but also for  the delicate problem of Albanian emigrants and the regulation of  their status in Greece.</p>

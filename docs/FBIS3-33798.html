And workers demonstrate against rising prices as well as  unemployment, corruption spreads, and hardliners denounce the  abandonment of revolutionary ideals.    When the Islamic revolution triumphed on February 1, 1979 in  the name of the have-nots, it made austerity a virtue and  nationalized entire sectors of the economy.    A decade and a half later, Iran has reversed course and  headed toward a market economy, a process which has plunged the  government into an unprecedented crisis and hit the poor  severely.    The liberalization drive was launched by President 'Ali  Akbar  Hashemi-Rafsanjani, just one year after the revolution's  charismatic leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeyni, died in 1989.    Hoping to revive an economy disrupted first by the  revolution  and then by the 1980-1988 war with Iraq, Hashemi-Rafsanjani  steadily removed subsidies, started monetary reform, and backed  privatization of industry and services.    He allowed foreign products back into Iran and urged wealthy  Iranians who had fled abroad during the revolution to return  home.    Liberalization filled stores with goods, plunged the country  into a spending spree after a decade of scarcity, and brought  new life into the Tehran Bazaar, the economy's traditional  driving force.    It also led to new fortunes for those who invested in real  estate.    Tehran's relationship with Washington is a symbol of its  current pragmatism.    While the leadership and the press continue to label  Washington as the "Great Satan" and the revolution's foremost  enemy, the United States in the past few years has become one of  Iran's main trading partners.    But this "second revolution" is going through increasingly  hard times as the government fails to control it properly and  some politicians and religious figures slow it down for fear of  its social consequences.    The return to a market economy and a sharp depreciation of  the rial have produced runaway inflation and impoverished much  of the population who can no longer afford many items especially  as subsidies have been withdrawn.    Corruption, which had disappeared in the first few years  after the revolution, has returned at an alarming pace.    Uncontrolled imports combined with falling oil revenues have  placed Iran on the brink of bankruptcy.    According to western sources, Iran for the first time in its  history is unable to reimburse its debts, and has accumulated 13  billion dollars in arrears in 18 months. The figure amounts to  one year of oil revenue.    The austerity policy Iran has adopted to overcome the  financial crisis has led to a steep fall in imports over the  past year but at the same time sparked a crisis for industry  which depends heavily on imported equipment.    Many factories are currently working at half or quarter  capacity. For the first time since the revolution, tens of  thousands of workers have been laid off, which has aggravated  social tension.    The current crisis, the most serious since the revolution,  has sparked sometimes brisk debate between free-market  supporters and an increasing number who back a return to  revolutionary basics and a centralized economy.    As the debate continues, many Iranian and foreign economic  observers do not rule out that the government -- divided and  unable to assume the political price of its reforms -- might  turn inward again.</p>

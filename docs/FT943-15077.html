			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Parti Quebecois softens stance Quebec's Parti Quebecois has toned down its separatist message in a clear shift of strategy ahead of forthcoming elections in the francophone province. The PQ is currently well ahead of the ruling Liberals in public opinion polls. But party leaders appear to have heeded findings that the PQ's popularity stems more from voters' desire for a change of government than from a dream of independence from the rest of Canada. Mr Jacques Parizeau, the PQ leader, and other senior officials have recently played down their earlier pledge to begin negotiations on sovereignty with the federal government immediately after the election. Instead, they have indicated that these talks will only begin after an independence referendum, which the PQ has promised to hold within a year of taking office. Some observers predict that even this timetable may turn out to be flexible, depending on the mood of the electorate. Mr Daniel Johnson, the province's premier, is expected to call an election within the next two weeks for September 12. The Liberals have been in office for nine years. Since taking over as premier last January, Mr Johnson has tried to overcome the protest vote by projecting an image of solid competence and by identifying the PQ with the economic costs of independence. Although it is still too early to count Mr Johnson out, even some of his officials acknowledge that nothing short of a miracle can save the Liberals. One problem for the Liberals is that their support is heavily concentrated in the Montreal area. Mr Johnson received another setback last weekend when Mr Claude Castonguay, a prominent federalist and former Liberal cabinet minister, expressed disillusionment with Canada's existing political system. 'I have to realise my sustained commitment . . .to the cause of Canadian unity has brought me nothing definitive but disappointment,' Mr Castonguay wrote in an open letter.</p>

			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chile squeezes copper company's budget CODELCO, THE Chilean state copper company, is scaling down its investment programme for 1993 after receiving a much smaller budget from the treasury than it had hoped for. The world's biggest copper producer had asked for Dollars 610m this year to develop new mines, expand production at its existing divisions and clean up the environmental mess caused by its old-fashioned smelters. But the treasury has assigned Codelco an investment budget of only Dollars 450m. Mr Alejandro Hales, the Chilean Mining Minister, said the budget was insufficient. He warned that the pace of certain projects might have to be slowed down. 'It is our hope that the Treasury will release additional funds later this year,' he said. Codelco's slim budget places a question mark over its key development project: the Radomiro Tomic copper deposit close to the Chuquicamata open-pit mine in the Atacama desert. Codelco executives say they need Dollars 450m to put Tomic into production. It is expected to be a medium-sized operation with an annual output of 150,000 tonnes of refined copper.</p>

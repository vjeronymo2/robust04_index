			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Arts: Drawn back to Mantegna - Some scholarly fun at the RA A fortnight ago, fresh from Andrea Mantegna at the Royal Academy, I described it is a 'miracle' of an exhibition. (Less understandably, I sited Mantua on Lake Garda and not on the lagoon, for which aberration, mea culpa.) I also noted that museums could only have justified the loan of so many exceedingly precious paintings, drawings, and prints by this late 15th-century master, on the grounds that this was an exhibition with a heavyweight scholarly agenda. In other words, it was not going to be enough for the general public to have a perfectly lovely time. The experts, too, would have to have their field day. If I have a (mild) criticism of this wonderful exhibition it is that the general public could well miss out on the scholarly fun. It is as though two feasts of Mantegna are set before us in the Academy. Self-service is, of course, delicious, and costs Pounds 4.00 for the entry fee. However, the 'menu-cards' - the labels and the printed room-by-room guide - might have done rather more to convey the novel and, it should be said, speculative view of Mantegna's art which lies behind this exhibition. The only hint the casual visitor will have that this is a controversial exhibition, is the innocent little phrase, 'here attributed to Mantegna himself', which crops up notably often in the guide. Finding out what that involves leaves you no choice but to up-grade from self-service to high table Mantegna. The cost is Pounds 22.50 for the highly informative catalogue - and a long morning's read. What, then, seems to be the new view of Mantegna? Most strongly it comes out in the exhibition's magnificent prints and drawings. In most Old Master exhibitions, the room set aside for works of art on paper is the one which visitors with aching feet will bypass. This time, it is virtually impossible to take a painting-centred view of the artist. Collaboration between the Academy's lighting technicians and conservators have made it possible for prints and drawings to be hung beside the paintings to which they relate. This technical achievement has the effect of letting us see the world as if through Mantegna's two pairs of spectacles. There was the world he strove, with obsessive care, to image in colour. But that same world he also had the vision, as no one had ever done before, to image in black and white. David Landau, who has curated the prints, is also chairman of the exhibition's steering committee and was responsible for the initial idea for a major Mantegna show, conceived after mounting an exhibition of the artist's engravings at Christ Church, Oxford, in 1979. Landau is not only a print scholar and editor of Print Quarterly. More surprisingly, he is also joint managing editor of Loot, London's free advertising newspaper. This makes Landau an amateur among the art-historians, a status he values highly. 'I have the freedom to say what I think. People in academe and museum worlds will be more cautious, because they have got a lot to lose.' Landau's views on Mantegna as a printmaker emphasise how extraordinary it was that the artist in his 30s and busy painting the Camera Picta in Mantua, decided to experiment with engraving on copper. The technique was then in its infancy, and was used principally by German artists for small, cheap devotional images, playing cards, and the like. Mantegna, however, did not see engraving as a technique merely to multiply images mechanically. At this stage in his career he was well-enough funded by the Gonzagas not to bother with that. He looked at Donatello's bronze reliefs, and at his beloved antique carved gems and cameos of antiquity, and saw that it would be possible to create a work of art using black, white and greys to express tone and volume. It was, comments Landau, 'a tremendous leap in our visual culture'. There is no evidence Mantegna actually incised plates himself. However, Landau's study of engravings by Mantegna and his workshop leads him to add four to the canonical list of seven made by the artist. They include the 'Flagellation' and the 'Descent into Limbo'. For an artist who had trained as a miniaturist (the exhibition attributes to young Mantegna a beautiful little illumination of the infant Christ in a basket), working with tiny strokes on copper perhaps came easily , although Landau describes Mantegna as an artist experimenting, not getting the first engravings right. Mantegna, a restless genius, lost interest once he had mastered engraving - the heavenly 'Virgin and Child' represents the pinnacle of achievement. But as he grew old, he wanted prints of his paintings and hired professional engravers. Landau believes there was only one engraver, Giovanni Antonia da Brescia, although the catalogue goes for two engravers, adding in a figure called the Premier Engraver. The catalogue also reveals that one of the team of scholars, Suzanne Boorsch, disagreed radically with Landau's views, and argues that none of the engravings was actually from Mantegna's own hand. Landau stresses that there is nothing remotely whimsical in the conclusions that he, Boorsch, Keith Christiansen (paintings) and David Ekserdjian (drawings) put forward in this momentous exhibition. A condition he set the Academy, the Metropolitan in New York, exhibition's sponsors, Olivetti, was that during the three years of preparation the scholar-team should together examine as many as possible of the works which would be exhibited. This intense collaboration, Landau and Ekserdjian agree, was unique and extraordinarily valuable. Ekserdjian recognised that a drawing of 'Christ between SS. Andrew and Longinus' which he found in a box of Mantegna's prints in Munich, was no copy but an important working drawing for the print. The artist, unsure about Christ's posture, has cut out the head and pasted it back at a different angle. Ekserdjian also had two drawings uncovered, one whose ghostly existence had previously been spotted (the head of a man) and the other, a design for a candelabra, which had not. Only 30 drawings are generally recognised as being by Mantegna: adding another three is no mean achievement. As they travelled the world's print-rooms and galleries, the Mantegna team evidently generated heat as well as light. Landau speaks of 'tremendous rows', and having to argue fiercely for his four reattributions. He helped his case by developing a new technique, superimposing enlarged transparencies on a light-box to show exactly how the artist's drawings were used for engravings. I have not exhausted all the novel and controversial aspects of the team's ideas, but at least I may have suggested why this level of academic input makes Mantegna a deeply serious, as well as a beautiful, exhibition. Maybe we should have seen a little more of the scholarly tail, which certainly does not wag the dog. But if you have ever wondered whether art-historians are not merely playing a rather pointless game of attributions and reattributions, bear it in mind that without this scholarly tail we would never have seen the dog.</p>

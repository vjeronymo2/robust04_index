All the measures will be put into  effect starting this year. The Ministry of Finance believes  this move tallies with the requirements of building a socialist  market economic structure, conforms with the international  practice, and can help enterprises compete with each other on a  fair and equal footing.    Major measures are as follows:    --Rates of income tax collected from domestic-funded  enterprises will be standardized at 33 percent, while the  regulatory business tax levied on state-owned large and medium  enterprises will be abolished.    However, in consideration of the poor economic efficiency  and  inability to submit more profits to higher authorities, the  Ministry of Finance has introduced two preferential tariff  rates: Enterprises with an annual tax and profit amounting to  less than 30,000 yuan can enjoy a reduced tax rate of 18  percent, while enterprises with an annual tax and profit of  between 30,000 and 100,000 yuan can enjoy a reduced tax rate of  27 percent.    --The practice of repaying loans before paying taxes will be  abolished. Enterprises are required, without exception, to use  their own retention funds to repay the principal of loans they  have borrowed for fixed assets investment and no deduction will  be made before they pay tax.    --A system of after-tax profit distribution on state-owned  assets investment will be set up gradually, featuring  distribution of dividends in proportion to shares, allotment of  profits according to capital ratio, and submission of after-tax  profits. In view of the realistic situation in enterprises and  according to the state industrial policy, enterprises' task of  technical transformation, and other realistic conditions, the  Ministry of Finance is considering the possibility of putting  into effect in most fully state-owned old enterprises (with the  dividing line drawn at 31 December 1993) a practice by which  such enterprises will not submit profits to higher authorities  after paying income tax; at the same time, income tax paid by  enterprises with narrow profit margins will not be returned to  the paying units.    --Budget readjustment funds levied on state-owned  enterprises  by key construction foundations, including energy and  communications foundations, will be abolished. The increased  financial revenue should be earmarked primarily for the  repayment of enterprise fixed assets investment loans.    --Loans borrowed by enterprises long ago can be dealt with  on  a case-by-case basis. We need to study and resolve the issue of  "changing allocation of funds into loans" in line with the  structural reform of the investment system. Those enterprises  which really lack the ability to repay can be allowed to  postpone their repayment upon examination and verification by  the banks. Meanwhile, banks can check their bad debts through  careful examination and verification and then offset them with  reserves for bad loans according to relevant stipulations; at  the same time, they can also raise the rate of extraction of  their bad debt reserves.    --Farming [bao shui 0545 4451] of taxes as well as tax  exemptions not stipulated in the state's Taxation Law will be  abolished.    --Preferential tax policies granted to foreign-invested  enterprises will remain unchanged.</p>

			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: SAN GABRIEL;  </P> <P> SUIT OVER SCHOOL EXPANSION  </P> <P> The often-divided City Council has voted unanimously to file a lawsuit against  the Alhambra School District, charging that a plan to expand crowded San  Gabriel High School is ill-conceived and injurious to residents of the city.  </P> <P> The school, San Gabriel's primary public high school, is actually in Alhambra,  just across San Gabriel's western boundary. The district plans to build a new  cafeteria, increase classroom capacity by more than 300 students and build a  parking lot with access onto Fairview Avenue in a residential section of San  Gabriel known as the Village.  </P> <P> City Atty. Stephanie Scher said an environmental impact statement prepared by  the district gives little indication how many students would be assigned to the  school, which city officials say already has 50% more students than it was  designed to handle.  </P> <P> Village residents worry that their streets will be flooded with school-related  traffic. "The problem is that it would dump traffic onto the streets all at one  time, like opening a spigot," said City Administrator Robert Clute.  </P> <P> The council and the district have held numerous negotiating sessions on the  issues.  </P> <P> "They've turned a deaf ear on us," said Vice Mayor Frank Blaszcak.  </P> <P> Scher said the suit would be filed before the end of the week in Los Angeles  Superior Court.  </P> <P> District officials declined to comment.  </P></p>

			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Future belongs to astrologers ONCE UPON a time people read newspapers in order to read news. They wanted to find out what had happened in the world the day before. Now people read newspapers to find out what will happen tomorrow, and, in particular, what will happen to them. The astrologer has become the most successful writer in newspaper and magazine publishing, outstripping in both pay and popularity even the most esteemed journalist. Then there are those who tell readers not what will happen to them, but what they should do, to make the right things happen. These are the agony aunts, scarcely less popular than the astrologers, and scarcely less tendentious. Perhaps the most famous is 'Dear Abby', syndicated worldwide to inform Asia and Africa of what middle-aged female America thinks is the correct way to eat at table. The great masses of these continents seem to take all this very seriously: they have an inkling that the US is the world's dominant culture, and therefore worth respect, if not imitation. We, however, do not import the East's astrology and agony columns, which is a great pity. They are far more entertaining than their western counterparts. One of my favourites is Dr Paisarl, whose 'Thai astrology' column appears just underneath 'Dear Abby' in the Bangkok Sunday Post. Dr Paisarl is wonderfully clear in his answers to the most difficult questions, in sharp contrast to the wishy-washy generalisations of his western rivals. In a recent issue, one of his female correspondents (they usually are female) wrote 'I wish for you to predict when I will meet my life partner and have my own business. I was born in Bangkok on July 18th 1965, at 3.25 am.' Dr Paisarl had all the facts at his fingertips. 'Dear Madam: Against all the odds you cannot initiate any business of your own. It's only your wishful thinking. However, you will regularly get a very high salary until your retirement. Don't try to change it, except after you marry . . . Your life partner will be a widower many years your senior. He will be a smart-looking well-off man, who will always try to please you. He may have two children from his previous marriage. You will have a chance to meet him this October or by January at the latest. You will develop your super-romantic love very fast and get married next year.' To a correspondent, writing from India with the simple request: 'Could you please tell me about my future in general?' Dr Paisarl responds: 'As for your personal life, you will barely have the freedom to choose your own spouse. You will get married with the one selected by your parents. You will change your residence next year and rarely will you stay in your home town. You can settle down between 1996 and 1997 but you are unlikely to have many children.' 'Dear Abby' and the other US agony aunts seem on the face of it to come from a much saner world. On the same day as the items I quote from Dr Paisarl Dear Abby published a letter from 'Colorado mother', who wrote that: 'Yesterday my four year old daughter took a nasty spill and hit her face on our coffee table. She now has a black eye and a terrible bruise. This morning, out of fear of being accused of child abuse, I cancelled the time I had reserved for her at the day care centre. I really had nothing to hide, but these days all it takes is a whisper, a rumour and the child welfare people will be calling on you and asking a lot of questions. It is getting like the Salem witch hunts all over again.' Dear Abby replied that 'Colorado mother' should have taken her child to school, adding the rather sinister proviso 'if, as you explained, the child fell . . . and you had nothing to hide.' I imagine that most western readers would find Dear Abby reassuringly normal after the bleak lives and primitive assurances of Doctor Paisarl. But it seems to me that the middle America conjured up by Abby and her neurotic correspondents is a crazier place by far. The East might still have arranged marriages, but it has avoided the witch hunts of the West's social workers. Dominic Lawson is Editor of The Spectator.</p>

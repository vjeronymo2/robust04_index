			<p>BFN     [Text] Here is an interview given by the Russian  president's special envoy Viktor Posuvalyuk on the Middle East  situation. Viktor Posuvalyuk heads the Middle East and Africa  section in the Russian Foreign Ministry. We asked him to share  with us his opinion about the prospect of the introduction of  Palestinian self rule after the signing in Egypt of the Israeli  and Palestinian agreement relating to Gaza and the town of  Jericho. Here is the exclusive interview he granted us.    The Russian leadership and the majority of the population  are  overwhelmed with the signing in Cairo of an agreement on Gaza  and the town of Jericho. The agreement is already being  implemented. According to the Russian diplomat, the essence of  this step is that it is the beginning of a practical advance  toward a final agreement in the Israeli and Palestinian  negotiations direction and toward an autonomy for the  Palestinians [as heard]. Simultaneously, it is an advance  toward more security for the Israeli population.    Now it can be said that the Palestine Liberation  Organization, PLO, will have to assume control of the  territories from where the Israeli troops and police are pulled  out. The task here is of a multifaceted nature including the  domestic needs of the population. These problems are  particularly acute in Gaza.    Further on, the Russian diplomat said that Russia wished  that  a switch to a Palestinian administration was not accompanied  with any internal Palestinian confrontation or an escalation of  strife. Russia will expect that on the contrary there will be an  active political force in these territories that will support  the Palestinian authority in Gaza and Jericho.    We in Russia will warmly welcome it if there is a consensus  and mutual understanding between the Palestinians and the  leaders of the PLO, the leading officers of the Palestinian  policemen, and such organization as the HAMAS [Islamic  Resistance movement] and other Palestinian political figures who  hold a more radical view [as heard].    This is no time for arguments or bloodshed. This is time to  begin solving actual problems of the Palestinian people. It is  time to move toward peace. [Words indistinct] that the agreement  on Gaza and Jericho as the beginning of the implementation of  the agreement signed in Washington last year, will firmly serve  the aim of peacemaking, calmness, and toning town the pitch of  passions inside Israel itself.    Concluding his interview to Radio Moscow, Viktor Posuvalyuk  said that Russia supports the Rabin government's policy directed  at finding a political settlement of the issue and ensuring  peace in this Middle East region. At the same time, Mr.  Posuvalyuk stressed, it is necessary to mention all the other  negotiations, among which we still regard the Syrian one as one  of the (?pilots) in the Middle East peace efforts.    I can confirm here that Russia has taken and will take in  this direction a most energetic part in bringing peace to the  Middle East.</p>

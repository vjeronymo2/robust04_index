			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen, in </F> Copenhagen, by John Humphries, in London -- live]    [Text] [Humphries] Mr. Helveg Petersen, Denmark took a  fairly skeptical view over Maastricht in order to protect its  own sovereignty. Don't you therefore have some sympathy for the  British view on the voting system?    [Petersen] Well, I have a lot of sympathy for the United  Kingdom, for Great Britain; we have in many issues been in  agreement, but on this issue I think there are very solid  reasons why the predominant view inside the European Union --  that is the view of 10 out of 12 countries -- is the correct one  and I would mention at least three major reasons why it is so.  First of all, it is the historical precedent when Denmark, the  United Kingdom, and Ireland joined, we readjusted the level for  qualified majority. Accordingly it was done at the time of our  entry, it was done again with the entry of Greece, with the  entry of Spain and Portugal. All the time, it has been the  Community rule around 70 percent of the vote constituted a  qualified majority, that is, 30 percent would be a block...    [Humphries, interrupting] And the other two reasons?    [Petersen] That is the overriding interest of my country,  and  I think indeed also of the United Kingdom -- that is, that the  Nordic countries and Austria now could become members. We  should not delay that, and it will be delayed if we do not agree  on another figure than 23. And thirdly, what is really at stake  here also for the United Kingdom, for Denmark, for others, is  that the government conference in 1996, which is going to set  the rules for the community of the future, that that is an  enlarged Community taking these decisions, including the  Scandinavian countries and Austria. I think that is deeply also  in the interests of England.    [Humphries] Isn't the reality though, that when you sit at  that table in Brussels on Tuesday [22 March] with Douglas Hurd  and all the rest of you, you're going to have a lot of talk and  a lot of negotiating, and you're going to emerge perhaps a bit  bleary-eyed on Wednesday morning, the early hours of Wednesday  morning with a compromise, with a fudge, isn't that the reality?    [Petersen] Well I hope so, I certainly hope so. I think all  parties to the debate now have made their points, I've certainly  made mine, others have done so as well, and now is the time to  find solutions, and we should do that on Tuesday.    [Humphries] You say find solutions, do you mean by that find  a compromise? Are you in the first place prepared to shift on  the matter of 23 and 27?    [Petersen] I think the only realistic view is to say -- 23  that can never become an agreed position in the council...    [Humphries, interrupting] Never under any circumstances?    [Peterson] Oh no, I don't think so. That will never be a  position that could create a common position. Therefore we will  have to be looking for something else. I think Britain should  be very clear on this. There will never be an agreement on 23,  we will have to look for something else. I think there's a lot  of good sense in the proposition that has been put forward  saying it's 27, yes, but if the majority of 23 or more are  opposed it would take a period of rethinking in good faith  trying then to establish a formula that could be a consensus of  [words indistinct].    [Humphries] So what are you saying here, I'm not quite sure  about what you are saying, whether you're saying we can put off  the decision, the entire decision, or whether....    [Petersen, interrupting] No, I was talking about a  compromise, saying well it's 27, that's a blocking in minority,  but if there is any voting in council, 23 or more but not 27,  that would create a special situation up to the moment when we  have the government conference in 1996.    [Humphries] Right, so you're talking about some sort of  cooling-off period.    [Petersen] Yes.    [Humphries] For how long?    [Petersen] Of rethinking?    [Humphries] Yes.    [Petersen] One month, it could be twice one month, that's  not  so important, one could look for solutions along these lines. I  think that should be acceptable to everyone, and such a  cooling-off period -- or think-again period I would prefer to  call it -- is absolutely very valuable. It is true that it  gives a chance for national parliaments and national public  opinion to make itself felt in the debate.    [Humphries] There is no way, is there, in which you can  separate, decouple these two issues, that's to say the  acceptance of the four new members and the question of qualified  majority voting. So you say OK, we'll have the four in and then  we'll decide, we'll sort it out afterward?    [Petersen] No, that's not possible, for very good legal  reasons, after all, what we have to sign with the four applicant  countries is a new treaty and the treaty or adoption of the  treaty, so there will have to be texts in the agreement also  covering this problem.    [Humphries] Let me remind you of what you did, I think, say  earlier this week, the British position, I quote, is absolutely  untenable, this cannot be solved by another meeting, the Brits  should call us when they have reconsidered. Is that still your  position?    [Petersen] It is my position, as I said just a moment ago,  everybody including myself have made our positions clear, we  shall now seek solutions, do it on Tuesday and come up with the  result.    [Humphries] Right, and so if Mr. Hurd is not prepared to  accept the compromise that you seem now to be suggesting, no  deal?    [Petersen] Well in that case, there's no enlargement and  that  is, I think, deeply regrettable. It is not possible to have 23  and enlargement, that is very clear now.    [Humphries] Mr. Helveg Peterson, thank you very much.</p>

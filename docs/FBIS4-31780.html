			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, June 10 (ATA) -- Statements by a senior  official of the Socialist Party of Serbia, Bogdanovic, who is at  the same time deputy chairman of the Chamber of Republics in the  Assembly of the self-declared Yugoslavia, that there will be no  talks with Rugova are not only discouraging but they close all  possible ways for a dialogue between Pristina and Belgrade, the  newspaper BUJKU of Pristina writes. In one of its commentaries  entitled "With Whom Will the Serbian Party Talk?" BUJKU stresses  that if Bogdanovic's statements are the final say of the  Belgrade government, then the Serbian party has nothing to do  but to negotiate with ghosts.</p>

			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Overseas holidays expected to fall THE NUMBER of people taking an overseas holiday could fall next year in spite of an encouraging start to summer 1993 bookings, a survey published yesterday suggests. The survey, conducted for Lunn Poly, the biggest UK travel agency, revealed that 32 per cent of the 1,000 people questioned planned to take a summer holiday abroad next year. In last year's survey, 44 per cent said they planned to take a foreign holiday in summer 1992. In the event, only 22 per cent did so. In spite of indications that the recession has dented holidaymakers' confidence, summer 1993 bookings are up 5 per cent on last year according to Mr Peter Rothwell, Lunn Poly marketing director. A total of 950,000 holidays have already been sold for next summer. Lunn Poly's own sales are up by 45 per cent. Travel industry officials add that the early boost to bookings reflects the strength of the north of England economy compared with the south. As flights from regional airports are more limited than those from London, holidaymakers book earlier to ensure they can go away during school and factory holidays. Sales of this year's winter holidays are down by 12 per cent. Mr Rothwell attributed this to later booking of holidays this past summer. Travel industry sources point out that winter holidays tend to be more popular among those who, in better times, took second holidays. The survey showed, however, that 41 per cent of people would be prepared to cut other forms of expenditure to take overseas holidays.</p>

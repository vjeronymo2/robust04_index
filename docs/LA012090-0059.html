			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> OFFICIALS SAY DRUGS KEEP AIDS CASES BELOW ESTIMATES  </P> <P> County health officials say the increased use of potent drugs is slowing the  occurrence of AIDS in San Diego and keeping the number of cases below  projections made by experts three years ago.  </P> <P> The San Diego County Department of Health Services received 525 reports of new  AIDS cases last year, fewer than the 606 cases projected for 1989 by Dr.  Michele Ginsberg, the county epidemiologist.  </P> <P> But County Health Officer Dr. Donald Ramras said the number of cases of  acquired immune deficiency syndrome is not decreasing but surfacing at a slower  rate because the virus that causes AIDS is taking longer to develop into the  disease.  </P> <P> More effective medication, such as AZT and pentamidine, is being used more  widely to slow the replication of the virus and to ward off other infections  that attack a patient's weakened immune system.  </P> <P> The earlier projections estimated 728 new cases in 1990 and another 839 in  1991. Health officials now expect about 550 additional AIDS cases this year; a  revised projection for 1991 was unavailable.  </P> <P> "The projections are lower than what they were a few years ago, but that does  not mean that the epidemic is over," Ramras said. "Available treatment is  keeping people from developing the disease for a longer period of time, but  it's not curing them."  </P> <P> "There are many, many people out there who are ill and infected with the AIDS  virus, but are not ill enough to fit the case description, so we don't know  about them," Ramras said. State law requires that physicians report to health  officials only those patients who have fully developed cases of AIDS.  </P> <P> A person who has contracted the AIDS virus might not develop symptoms of the  disease for eight to 10 years, and now can remain symptom-free even longer with  the use of better drugs. But, sooner or later, those people will raise the AIDS  toll, Ramras said.  </P> <P> "Unless, of course, we find a cure," he said. "Unfortunately, I don't  anticipate that happening anytime soon."  </P> <P> Since the county Department of Health Services began tracking AIDS patients in  1981, a total of 1,702 county residents have been found to have the disease.  More than 60%, or 1,025, have died, Ramras said.  </P> <P> Even more fatalities are expected as the disease makes inroads into the  heterosexual community, according to health officials and private groups  fighting the spread of AIDS.  </P> <P> "We are seeing a dramatic rise in the number of AIDS cases among  heterosexuals," said Bill Freeman, executive director of the AIDS Assistance  Fund of San Diego County, a nonprofit group that offers a variety of services,  including providing food, shelter and emergency grants to people suffering from  AIDS and AIDS-related complex.  </P> <P> Bisexual practices and intravenous drug use are two primary reasons for the  spread of the disease among heterosexuals, health officials say.  </P> <P> "Just a few years ago, 80% to 90% of all AIDS cases nationwide were among gay  and bisexual men," Freeman said. "Now that number has gone down to about 65%,  which tells you that the disease is no longer contained within a discrete  community.  </P> <P> "There are still many people out there who believe that only certain people can  get AIDS," Freeman added. "Well, that's just not true. All of America is  susceptible. The virus doesn't discriminate. It isn't who you are or where you  are, it's what you do" that puts you at risk.  </P> <P> Some private care groups, including the AIDS Assistance Fund, have expressed  concern that the county's method of counting AIDS cases excludes hundreds who  have the disease.  </P> <P> Critics say county statistics do not take into account San Diego residents in  whom AIDS was diagnosed before they moved here.  </P> <P> According to state reporting laws, physicians are required to report only cases  that develop in their counties.  </P> <P> "We only report the cases that are diagnosed here," Ramras said. "If someone  from St. Paul, Minn., moves to San Diego and was diagnosed with the disease  before he came here, then it's the responsibility of the health officials in  St. Paul to take note of that case."  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AVIANCA PILOT DISPUTES NEED TO USE SPECIFIC EMERGENCY TERMS  </P> <P> The cockpit crew's failure to use "standard phraseology" to report a critical  fuel shortage was defended by an Avianca Airlines flight captain as hearings  continued here Thursday on the January crash of an Avianca jetliner that ran  out of fuel.  </P> <P> Air traffic controllers had testified earlier that, because Mauricio Klotz,  co-pilot of the Boeing 707, used non-standard terms such "need priority" and  "running out of fuel," they failed to recognize the gravity of the situation  and did not give the plane immediate clearance to land at New York's John F.  Kennedy Airport after numerous delays on its long flight from Colombia.  </P> <P> "I was very surprised that 'priority' and 'running out of fuel' meant nothing  to them," Avianca Capt. Saul Pertuz, a Colombian citizen, told a National  Transportation Safety Board panel on Thursday. "I am terrified."  </P> <P> Referring to an Avianca route manual used in the training of the airline's  pilots, Pertuz said there is nothing in it "that says we must use specific  words . . . ."  </P> <P> "In my country and in this country, there have been a great number of  (emergency situations) in which the pilot would not use the word 'emergen"  Pertuz said. "He would just tell them what happened."  </P> <P> However, Klotz's copy of the route manual, recovered from the wreckage of  Flight 52, shows that Avianca's pilots have been trained to "declare an  emergency . . . and report fuel remaining . . . if the remaining usable fuel  supply suggests the need for traffic priority to ensure a safer landing."  </P> <P> The crew of Flight 52 did neither in the minutes before the big jet ran out of  fuel and slammed into a wooded hillside in nearby Cove Neck, Long Island,  killing 73 of the 158 aboard. Pilot Laureano Caviedes, co-pilot Klotz and the  flight engineer, Matias Moyano, were among those who died.  </P> <P> Recordings recovered from the cockpit show that the failure to declare an  emergency may have stemmed from a misunderstanding between the pilot and  co-pilot.  </P> <P> Two languages were being spoken -- English in the conversations with the  controllers, Spanish in the conversations between the pilot and co-pilot. In  addition, Caviedes had commented earlier that he was having trouble hearing  what Klotz was saying.  </P> <P> After an initial attempt to land at Kennedy was aborted when the plane sank  below the safe glide path in heavy, gusty winds, Klotz radioed controllers,  "We're running out of fuel . . . ."  </P> <P> Caviedes instantly told his co-pilot: "Tell him we're in emergency."  </P> <P> Sixteen seconds later, the captain repeated his order: "Advise him we are in an  emergency."  </P> <P> Four seconds after that, the captain asked Klotz, "Did you tell him?"  </P> <P> Although he had made no mention of an "emergency," Klotz replied, "Yes, sir, I  already advised him."  </P> <P> About 30 seconds later, Klotz again radioed controllers that "we're running out  of fuel."  </P> <P> "Did you already advise him that we don't have fuel?" the pilot asked Klotz.  </P> <P> "Yes, sir," the co-pilot replied.  </P> <P> Then, in one of the responses that remains a mystery, Klotz told controllers  who asked him if his fuel was adequate for the new approach route they had  recommended:  </P> <P> "I guess so. Thank you very much." About 7 minutes later, its engines starved  of fuel, the plane crashed.  </P></p>

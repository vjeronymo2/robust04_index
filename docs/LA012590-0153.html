			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 3 MIAMI OFFICERS CHARGED WITH STEALING CASH, DRUGS  </P> <P> A federal indictment Wednesday charged three police officers and four other men  with stealing more than $1 million in cash, 110 pounds of cocaine and a ton of  marijuana from drug dealers.  </P> <P> A separate indictment charged two other officers in a cocaine case.  </P> <P> The cases mark the widest-ranging police corruption indictments since 15 Miami  police officers were charged in a drug rip-off ring in 1984 and 1985.  </P> <P> U.S. Atty. Dexter Lehtinen said at a news conference that the defendants  arranged for the transfer of honest officers to other assignments as they  engaged in ripping off drug dealers between 1981 and 1987.  </P> <P> "They would come into the possession of information about where drug dealers  were, where illegal drugs were, and should have engaged in proper law  enforcement activities," Lehtinen said.  </P></p>

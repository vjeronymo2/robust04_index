			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0800 GMT on 29 April carries in its  regular 6-minute newscast three reports on the military  situation in the republic.    Brcko correspondent Hamid Deronjic reports that "overnight,  the Serbian aggressor concentrated the greatest amount of  manpower and equipment since the beginning of the preparations  for the resumption of the offensive on the free Brcko territory.  Chetnik transport helicopters, flying at low altitudes, [words  indistinct] flights on the Ovcari-Brcko route. An influx of an  immense quantity of motorized [words indistinct] was also  registered from the direction of Ovcari. Up until 2200 on the  Ovcari-Brcko route, the movement of heavy transport and combat  vehicles of the Serbian aggressor could be heard. Our  reconnaissance scouts were unable to register [words indistinct]  of chetnik reinforcements outside the Brcko area. The  concentration of enemy armored- mechanized hardware was  registered last night on the central part of the Brcko front,  Cadjavac, and Bijelina Ravna. The temporarily occupied Brcko is  full of chetniks; the town is literally overflowing with chetnik  phalanxes, which are causing increasing problems even for the  citizens of Serbian nationality. According to our  reconnaissance sources, Brcko Serbs are afraid to leave their  homes for fear that they might be robbed [words indistinct]."    An unidentified correspondent reports on an extremely poor  line that "chetnik activity in the 4th Corps theater of  operations, or more precisely, on the Konjic and Bijelimic  fronts [words indistinct]. In addition to antiaircraft machine  gun and small arms fire at the defense lines and suburbs of  Konjic, Karadzic's followers early this morning fiercely shelled  the residential areas in Glavicine. At the time of filing this  report, the offensive activity has decreased somewhat. There  was no offensive activity of the Serbian-Montenegrin aggressor  on the southern part of the front, while the separation lines  between the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the Croatian Defense  Council [HVO] [words indistinct]. However, we must say that the  implementation of the Washington Agreement in this area is  progressing very slowly simply because the HVO still has not  given up on its intention to divide Mostar."    Gracanica correspondent Izudin Durakovic reports that "the  aggressor continued provocations overnight, although mainly from  a distance. Using 82-mm mortars from Besanj, 122-mm howitzers  from Jajcevac, and tanks from Sjenina, the chetniks shelled  Obric and Mujanov Mezar. They tried to use the shelling to  infiltrate small subversion groups, which the defenders  discovered in time. During the night, the chetniks carried on  regrouping their manpower and hardware, which implies that they  will today continue their offensive activity on the northern  part of the Trebava [River] front."</p>

			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Taiwan eases investment curbs Taiwan announced yesterday that it would lift all restrictions on repatriation of investment earnings by foreigners and raise the limits on foreign investment in the securities, banking and insurance sectors. Mr Chang Chang-pang, deputy finance minister, said the moves 'would bring our financial services rules closer to the spirit of the Gatt Uruguay Round' and would promote Taiwan's efforts to become a regional financial centre. Until now, foreign investors have only been allowed to invest up to Dollars 100m at a time and must wait three months to repatriate income or capital. Mr Samuel Shieh, governor of the Central Bank of China (Taiwan's central bank), said it was 'still not appropriate' to lift the ban on individual foreign investors owning more than 5 per cent of the stock of a listed Taiwan company.</p>

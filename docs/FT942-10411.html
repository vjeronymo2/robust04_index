			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Indian reserve bank aims to curb inflation The Reserve Bank of India is set to move against soaring inflationary pressures at its board meeting this Saturday. But with industry only beginning to recover from two years' stagnation, Mr C. Rangarajan, the governor, and his colleagues will be reluctant to clamp down on the supply of funds to business. 'The RBI is in a difficult position. It is worried about inflation and lack of private investment in the economy,' says Mr SL Rao, director of the National Council for Applied Economic Research, an independent think-tank. Figures this week show the inflation rate has risen to its highest level since July 1992, with the wholesale price index for the week ending April 16 showing an annual increase of 11.1 per cent. Prices have been pushed up by financial pressures and shortages in specific commodities, caused by poor harvests. The main financial pressure has been increased borrowing by the government which saw the fiscal deficit for the year ending in March rise to 7.3 per cent of GDP, against a target of 4.7 per cent. The target for the current year is 6 per cent. Inflationary effects have been compounded by the large inflow of foreign capital into India's financial markets, helping to take foreign exchange reserves to a record Dollars 16bn (Pounds 7.6bn). Mr Manmohan Singh, finance minister, said last week he expected the inflation rate to fall after the next three months, because the current rate of increase has been influenced by a round of rises in government-administered prices for fuel and other commodities early this year. Inflationary pressures tend to ease in the autumn, when crops are harvested in many regions. The authorities are under pressure from industry to keep down the cost of credit. Latest figures for industrial production at first glance appear to show strong advances, with a year-on-year rise of 6.7 per cent recorded in December; preliminary estimates indicate gains of 7.2 per cent and 7.6 per cent in January and February. But these figures, which follow marginal gains of 2 per cent or less in earlier months, exaggerate the improvement, because industry was hit by unrest following the destruction of the Ayodhya mosque in the same months in 1992-93. There was an underlying gain in output, but it was more modest. One factor complicating the RBI's discussions is that demand for credit has been generally weak. Large companies have been raising capital in domestic and international markets and using it, not for new investments, but for paying off expensive loans. The banking system is awash with excess liquidity. A tightening of credit policy, through an increase in interest rates or curbs on loans, may have little effect. The central bank's other main option is to increase the cash reserve ratio. The RBI board usually sets credit policy in six-month cycles. But because of delays in forming the present board, this week's meeting - for the period up to the end of September - is being held late.</p>

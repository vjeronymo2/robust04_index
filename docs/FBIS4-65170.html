			<p>BFN     [Text] Eutin (DPA) -- In the opinion of FRG Chancellor  Helmut Kohl (Christian Democratic Union), European unification  has to be advanced, in order to secure Germany's economic  future. "We will only be able to maintain our place in the  world if we compete together with others," Kohl said at an  European election event of his party in Eutin  (Schleswig-Holstein) on Tuesday evening [10 May]. Every fourth  job in the old laender depends on exports to countries of the  European Union, Kohl stressed. German unity and European  unification are two sides of the "same coin," Kohl emphasized.  "If we do the right thing now, peace and freedom in Europe will  be secured in the 21st century."    According to the chancellor, a single currency in a joint  Europe must, above all, be stable. The FRG Government will not  agree to a European currency if it does not have the same  stability and quality as the German mark. At the rally, in  which, according to police estimates, about 1,000 people  participated, Kohl welcomed the decision in favor of Frankfurt  on Main as the seat of the future European central bank.    In the domestic policy part of his speech, Kohl said that,  in  his opinion, the FRG has overcome the economic low. There is an  upward tendency. There are encouraging signs; a stable currency  and a low inflation rate are the "most social policy." [as  received]</p>

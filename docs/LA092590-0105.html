			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE;  </P> <P> NEW LAW EXPECTED TO HELP COMBAT FRAUD  </P> <P> A new weapon to combat fraudulent telephone-sales and investment schemes may be  coming to the city.  </P> <P> The City Council tonight is expected to pass a law requiring anyone who wants  to operate an investment or telephone-sales company in Irvine to fill out an  extra page of information about their business and themselves to receive a  business license.  </P> <P> "The form will give us more information on these companies, and it will make  them jump through the hoops, so to speak, so we can determine if they are  legitimate," Police Sgt. David Freedland said.  </P> <P> The form requires applicants to divulge whether they are registered with  various state and federal agencies regulating investment companies, whether the  owner of the business has been convicted of fraud-related offenses and whether  the business operates out of a post-office box or postal center.

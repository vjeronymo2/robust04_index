			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Speedy set-up of Channel 5 in balance Officials from the Department of National Heritage and the Department of Trade and Industry will meet today to try to finalise their position on whether a new Channel 5 that uses existing technology should be given the go-ahead. The issue is due to be raised in cabinet this week but a final decision is not expected. The Independent Television Commission wants to advertise Channel 5 and has asked whether the frequencies are still available. The DTI has been studying the implications of the launch of Channel 5 on the development of digital terrestrial television. At the moment the outcome seems evenly balanced between the immediate benefits of a channel available to 70 per cent of the population and the preservation of the maximum potential for launching digital television. Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage secretary, has not yet received the report of the Radio Regulatory Agency on the issue. Meanwhile a study commissioned by the two largest ITV groups, Carlton and Granada, was last night delivered to the government. The discussion document, produced by Spectrum Strategy, argues strongly in favour of the long-term desirability of digital terrestrial transmission. It says all the potentially available frequencies should be reserved for this purpose. The study says the long-term gains include: more efficient use of scarce frequencies; the continuation of a universally available service with broader channel choice; and a clear path for the introduction of high-definition television. Spectrum concludes that the advantages Channel 5 offers - an immediate extension of choice for viewers and greater competition for advertisers  - are outweighed by the advantages of digital transmission, even though digital could only be funded by national subscription channels.</p>

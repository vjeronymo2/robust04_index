			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Seafield incurs Pounds 11.48m deficit Seafield, the property and transport group, ran up losses of Pounds 11.48m at the pre-tax level for the 1990 year, compared with previous profits of Pounds 3.41m. The deficit, however, was struck after taking account of exceptional items of Pounds 18.65m which principally related to a property revaluation deficit. An improvement in turnover to Pounds 30.7m (Pounds 13m) reflected a full 12 months' contribution from Charterhall and the transport companies. Losses per share worked through at 15.8p (earnings 9.8p). There is no dividend for the year - shareholders received a total of 2.4p for 1989. Net assets per share totalled 73p (92p) and year-end gearing stood at 78.7 (38.4) per cent.</p>

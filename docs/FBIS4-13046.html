			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Presidential Council Chairman 'Ali 'Abdallah </F> Salih at the police academy in Sanaa on 16 April -- recorded]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] All noble patriots must remain  steadfast. They must define their position toward the elements  that seek to partition the homeland using desecrated money,  money that we would have liked to have used on development  rather than on the purchase of weapons and explosives and  disturbing public order. This money could have been better  spent building a hospital or school or treating an incurable  disease instead of [words indistinct] and disturbing the public  peace.    Dear brothers: We are absolutely confident that all unionist  patriots of all political organizations and parties -- the  General People's Congress [GPC], the Yemeni Socialist Party  [YSP], the Yemeni Reform Grouping, and others -- will place the  interests of the homeland above all narrow and selfish interests.    We would have liked for this crisis not to have been dragged  out. The struggler 'Abdallah al-Sallal was a martyr of the  political crisis that was fabricated to redivide the Yemeni  homeland. This unity was brought about through peaceful and  democratic means, in which there was no annexation or coercion.  The unity was the result of prolonged dialogue that went on for  years and culminated on 22 May 1990, the date that saw an end to  the division of a homeland into two systems of government and to  the legacies of imamism and the end of odious colonialism  throughout the land. We engaged in protracted dialogue long  enough. Things came to a head on many occasions and we battled  and conspired against each other long enough. There was the  1972 war in which the victor was the loser. Then there was the  second 1979 battle, in which the victor was also the loser. We  are now working in earnestness and dedication and a sense of  responsibility to defeat all schemes meant to fuel sedition  within the ranks of the one Yemeni family. In that effort we  are aided by all the dedicated unionist patriots of all the  political groups and parties. We should work together toward  defeating all these schemes that seek to split the national  unity and reintroduce partition. The reintroduction of division  would be a terrible ordeal. Division will not be permitted to  return. There will not be a return to the state of affairs  where there were the Democratic People's Republic of Yemen in  the south and the Yemeni Arab Republic in the north of the  homeland. That would be a disaster for all sections of this  people, especially now that we have political pluralism, unity,  and political parties throughout the country. Neither the GPC,  nor the Yemeni Reform Grouping, nor the Arab Socialist Ba'th  Party, nor the Right Party, nor the League of the Sons of Yemen  Party, nor the Democratic Nasirite Party, nor the YSP, nor any  other political faction will be custodian in one half of the  homeland or the other. The true and basic need is for these  political parties to spread across the land. No one has the  right of custodianship on what used to be known as the north of  the homeland or what used to be known as the south of the  homeland.    God forbid, if we were sucked into the schemes of the  fabricators of the crisis, who were paid to tear the Yemeni  unity asunder, and if the Yemeni people fought among themselves  throughout the land, we would have to come to an understanding  and sit at the negotiating table to solve this problem as  happened in 1972 and 1979. In other words, as political groups  and parties we must sit at the negotiating table and solve our  problems before any harm is done. I thank all brothers and  comrades who have played a positive role on the Political Forces  Dialogue Committee for their efforts. I hope that each of them  will remain a support for unity instead of secession and that  they will not take the side of any political groups directly or  indirectly, neither behind the scenes nor through the telephone,  to tell this or that party they are in the right.    In my name and on behalf of my fellow members on the  Presidential Council and the executive and legislative branches,  I ask God's mercy for the soul of Marshal 'Abdallah al-Sallal,  whose departure was a great loss to the homeland.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Customs Corridor for Macedonia Next </F> Month"]    [Text] The general director of the Romanian customhouse  Mihai Panzaru said that Romania is close to finishing the  preparations for the opening of a customs corridor for Macedonia  [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. The  realization of this endeavor is planned for the middle of next  month.    The idea for a "customs corridor" which would connect  Macedonia with the Western European countries, as it was  emphasized in Bucharest, was given by the U.S. Administration,  with the aim of helping Macedonia and carrying out its trade  deals, which has been made difficult by the Greek embargo and  the upholding of the sanctions against Federal Republic  Yugoslavia.    Mihai Panzaru said "the corridor will span from Austria  through Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, to Macedonia." He added  that Romania has already discussed this with the Hungarian  authorities, while the Bulgarian side is also expected to be  contacted these days.</p>

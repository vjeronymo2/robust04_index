			<p><P> March 31, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Rockets fired by Syrian troops in their battle with Lebanese Christian army  units hit Beirut's main fuel depot, causing fires and explosions that forced  50,000 residents to flee. Hospital officials said 53 people were injured. A  police spokesman said Syrian gunners fired at least six Katyusha rockets into  Christian East Beirut, killing two people. The casualties brought the toll to  125 killed and more than 400 wounded in the artillery duel that began March 8  between the 20,000 Christian troops commanded by Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun and an  alliance of Syrian forces and Walid Jumblatt's Druze militia. Most of the  casualties have been civilians.  </P></p>

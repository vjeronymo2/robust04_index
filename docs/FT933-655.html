			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Heron ahead on debt repayments HERON, Mr Gerald Ronson's property and trading company, is ahead of schedule on debt repayments agreed in its Pounds 1.4bn refinancing completed last Friday. But deteriorating conditions in continental European property markets mean 'the risk of not meeting both the short and long-term obligations has increased', it said yesterday. Heron said the directors 'remain satisfied that there is a reasonable prospect that the group will be able to meet its financial obligations'. Following the completion of the refinancing, Lord Boardman, former chairman of NatWest Bank, has become chairman of Heron as expected. Heron also announced the appointment as non-executive director of Mr Lionel Ross, who was finance director of Whitbread until 1990. Trading started in new securities issued to replace Heron's bonds. The senior debt opened on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange at 50 per cent and closed at 61 per cent of face value. Junior debt was quoted at 10 to 15 per cent, while the shares were quoted at 4p to 8p. Results for the year to March, published yesterday, showed that the refinancing costs had risen to Pounds 74m. At one stage in the refinancing, which took 18 months, Heron told advisers it would stop paying fees as they were mounting too rapidly. The group returned to profit at the operating level with a surplus of Pounds 30m, compared with a loss of Pounds 188m the previous year. After interest of Pounds 77m and exceptional items of Pounds 125m, there was a net loss of Pounds 174m. Details, Page 22</p>

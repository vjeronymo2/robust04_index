			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow becalmed in Columbus Day doldrums Wall Street US SHARE prices edged higher in light trading yesterday as the Columbus Day holiday depressed business activity and kept the bond market shut, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 8.67 at 3,593.41. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 0.57 firmer at 460.88, while the Amex composite was up 2.89 at 467.59, and the Nasdaq composite up 3.39 at 767.66, a record high. Trading volume on the NYSE was 183m shares, and rises outnumbered declines by 1,009 to 944. Analysts had said that the markets would be quiet because of the Columbus Day holiday (which closes the country's banks and many companies), and they were right. Trading was light throughout the day, and prices remained in a narrow trading range, rarely straying far from Friday's closing values until a late surge at the end. Sentiment remained subdued in the wake of last week's September employment report, which revealed continued weakness in the manufacturing sector and sub-par job creation growth rates. Equity investors were unable to look to bond prices for a lead because the cash bond market was closed for the day, although trading of Treasury bond futures in Chicago remained open. Activity overseas was no help either - European markets were little changed, and Tokyo was closed for a holiday. Among individual stocks, Aluminum Company of America, a leading Dow constituent, fell Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 66 7/8 after the big brokerage house, Merrill Lynch, downgraded its short-term rating on the stock in the wake of the company's earnings report last Friday. Paramount Communications eased Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 76 1/2 after the board of the entertainment group said that it would open 'informational discussions' with QVC, the home shopping network which has launched a bid for Paramount, but that it also remained committed to completing its agreed merger with Viacom, the cable television company. QVC, traded on the Nasdaq market, eased Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 56 1/4 on the news while Viacom 'A' shares rose Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 56 5/8 and the 'B' shares climbed Dollars 1 to Dollars 52 3/4 . Eli Lilly rose Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 53 5/8 in active trading after the big drugs group announced several cost-cutting measures which, the company hopes, will reduce its global pharmaceuticals workforce by 2,000, or 10 per cent, over the next year. Chock Full O Nuts rose Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 9 1/2 after the company said that it expected to achieve an 87 cents a share after-tax gain in its fiscal second quarter from the sale of its Hillside coffee operation. On the Nasdaq market, Intel fell Dollars 4 3/4 to Dollars 65 1/2 in volume of 20m shares after investors expressed disappointment at the group's third-quarter net income of Dollars 1.33 a share, which came in just below the median of analysts' forecasts.</p>

			<p><P> September 26, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> SUPPORT FOR HOUSING DEMONSTRATION SOUGHT  </P> <P> The county Human Relations Commission is urging community groups and residents  to support a national demonstration called Housing Now in Washington next week  that is aimed at the problem of homelessness.  </P> <P> The commission unanimously endorsed the event and its three major goals: ending  homelessness, providing permanent affordable housing opportunities and  restoring federal housing-assistance funds. The goals were announced by the  national spokesman for the event, Mitch Snyder, an advocate for the homeless.  </P> <P> "Recognizing that the budget for federal housing assistance has been cut 77%  over the last eight years, the commission is appalled by the thousands of  Orange Countians unable to find suitable housing," said Jean Forbath,  chairwoman of the commission. "This crisis calls for a massive demonstration in  our capital in order to bring a strong message to the President and Congress to  make housing a national priority."  </P> <P> The Housing Now event will be held in Washington Oct. 5 to 7. People interested  in joining Forbath and an Orange County delegation in the Washington  demonstration, may contact the Orange County Homeless Issues Task Force at  (714) 740-1157.  </P></p>

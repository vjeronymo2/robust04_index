			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (vii) If the exposure is to radar, television, or other microwave transmitters, the actual blasting circuit, with blasting cap included but without other explosives, shall be used to test for extraneous electricity. Personnel performing such tests shall be protected from the effects of an exploding blasting cap. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (viii) Blasting and demolition operations shall be suspended during electrical storms, approaching as well as in progress. At first sign of an electrical storm, cap wires and lead wires shall be short-circuited, and all personnel removed from the demolition area to a safe location. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ix) A galvanometer shall test the firing circuit for electrical continuity before it connects with the blasting machine. Before completing the circuit at the blasting machine or panel and signaling for detonation, the individual assigned to make the connections shall confirm that everyone in the vicinity is in a safe place. This individual shall not leave the blasting machine or its actuating device for any reason and, when using a panel, shall lock the switch in the open position until ready to fire, retaining the only key. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (x) When transported by vehicles with two-way radios, and when in areas presumed to have extraneous electricity, blasting caps shall be in closed metal boxes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) When conditions prevent the use of electrical initiators for detonation, safety fuses shall be used. At the beginning of each day's operation and whenever a new coil is used, the safety fuse's burning rate shall be tested. The fuse shall be long enough for personnel to retire to a safe distance. Under no circumstances shall the fuse length be less than that required for a 2-minute burning time. Approved crimpers shall be used to fix fuses to detonators. Only fuses small enough in diameter to enter the blasting cap without forcing shall be used. All personnel except the fuse-actuator shall retire to the personnel shelter or leave the demolition area before ignition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Servicing of destruction site.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Vehicles transporting explosive material to burning or demolition grounds shall meet the requirements of this part. No more than two persons shall ride in the cab. No one shall ride in the truck bed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Vehicles should be unloaded immediately and withdrawn from the burning or demolition area until destruction operations are completed. Containers of explosives shall not be opened before the vehicle has departed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Containers of explosives or ammunition items to be destroyed at the destruction site shall be spotted and opened at least 10 feet from each other and from explosive material set out earlier, to prevent rapid transmission of fire if premature should occur. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Empty containers shall be closed and removed to prevent charring or damage during burning of explosives. Delivery vehicles on the return trip shall pick up empty containers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;184.192  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Destruction by burning. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) No mixing of an explosive with extraneous material, other explosives, metal powder, detonators, or similar items shall occur without authorization. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Because of the danger of detonation, ammunition and explosives shall not be burned in containers or in large masses, except as directed by competent contractor authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Beds for burning explosives shall be no more than 3 inches deep. Wet explosives may require a thick bed of readily combustible material underneath and beyond to ensure that all the explosives shall be consumed upon ignition. An ignition train of combustible material leading to the explosives shall be arranged so that both it and the explosives burn against the wind. When wind velocity exceeds 15 miles per hour, no disposal by burning shall take place. For direct ignition of a combustible train, either a safety fuse long enough to permit personnel to reach protective shelter or a black powder squib initiated by an electric current controlled from a distance or protective structure shall be used. Tying two or more squibs together may be necessary to ensure ignition of the combustible train. Combustible materials are not needed for burning solid propellants ignited by squibs. The sites of misfires shall be evacuated for at least 30 minutes, after which two qualified persons shall approach the position of the explosives: one shall examine the misfire; the other shall act as backup. Watching the examination from a safe distance, with natural or artificial barriers or other obstructions for protection, the backup shall be prepared to rush to the examiner's aid should an accident occur. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Loose, dry explosives may be burned without being place on combustible material if burning shall be complete, leaving the ground uncontaminated. The ground shall be decontaminated often, for the safety of personnel and operations. Volatile flammable liquids shall not, at any stage, be poured over explosives or the underlying combustible material to accelerate burning. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Wet explosives shall always be burned on beds of nonexplosive materials. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) RDX should be burned in wet form to prevent detonation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Pyrotechnic materials in oil containers shall be emptied into shallow metal pans before burning. The open containers may be burned with the explosives. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Parallel beds of explosives prepared for burning shall be separated by not less than 150 feet. In subsequent burning operations, care shall be taken to prevent material being ignited from smoldering residue or from heat retained in the ground from previous burning operations. Unless a burned-overplot has been saturated with water, then passed a safety inspection, 24 hours shall elapse before the next burning. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;184.193  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Destruction by detonation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Detonation of ammunition or explosives being destroyed should occur in a pit not less than 4 feet deep and covered with not less than 2 feet of earth. The components should be placed on their sides or in that position exposing the largest area to the influence of initiating explosives. Demolition blocks shall be placed in intimate contact on top of the item to be detonated, secured by earth packed over them. Under certain circumstances, materials such as bangalore torpedoes and bulk high explosives may be substituted for demolition blocks. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Local regulations, atmosphere conditions, earth strata, etc., determine how many projectiles and explosives shall be destroyed at one time, both in pits and open sites. Taking these variables into account, the acceptable quantity shall be based on criteria in Subpart D of this part. The procedure should be used for destruction of fragmentation grenades, HE projectiles, mines, mortar shells, bombs, photoflash munitions, and HE rocket heads that have been separated from motors. When a demolition area is remote from inhabited buildings, boundaries, work areas, and storage areas, detonation may be accomplished without the aid of a pit, space permitting. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) After each detonation, the surrounding area shall be searched for unexploded material and items. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) In cases of misfires, the procedures in &sect;184.182(c) shall apply. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;184.194  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Destruction by neutralization. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Certain ammunition and explosives may be disposed of by neutralization. Methods of neutralization include dissolving water-soluble material and chemical decomposition. The contractor, responsible for investigation which of these is most appropriate, shall comply with all applicable local, State, and Federal requirements for disposal and contamination operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / International Company News: Record earnings at Fannie Mae THE Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) yesterday reported record fourth-quarter and full-year earnings for 1992, and forecast the US residential property market would rebound strongly during 1993. The company, which is the largest mortgage provider in the US, reported net income of Dollars 426.4m for the final quarter of 1992, the 20th consecutive record-breaking quarter for the company. In the corresponding three-month period of 1991, Fannie Mae earned Dollars 361m. The latest results meant Fannie Mae's 1992 profits reached a record Dollars 1.62bn, up 19 per cent on the Dollars 1.363bn earned in the previous year. Mr James Johnson, Fannie Mae's chairman, said 1992 had been an 'exceptional' year for the company, but added 1993 should be even better, forecasting that it would be the strongest year for home sales since 1979. A number of factors were behind Fannie Mae's earnings last year, including a big increase in the size of the company's net mortgage portfolio, which jumped 23 per cent to Dollars 156bn, and a 20 per cent increase in the balance of outstanding mortgage-backed securities (MBS) to Dollars 445bn. During the year, Fannie Mae issued a record Dollars 194bn of MBS, almost double the previous year's total. The company was also helped by record fees from sales of Remics (real estate mortgage investment conduits), which reached Dollars 87m and by its long-standing practice of issuing callable debt, which boosted earnings at a time when portfolio liquidations were running high. Net interest income for the year was Dollars 2.05bn, up 16 per cent from 1991, despite the fact that Fannie Mae's net interest margin fell from 142 basis points in 1991 to 137 basis points, primarily because of a big increase in short-term investment balances. Provisions set aside for losses were Dollars 320m last year, down from Dollars 370m in 1991 because of accounting changes. Charge-offs to the company's allowance for loan losses rose 29 per cent to Dollars 244m - the result of the growth in MBS and portfolio balances and weak economies in California and New England.</p>

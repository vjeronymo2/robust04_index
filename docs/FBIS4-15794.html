			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aleksey Aleksandrov: "Moscow As Guarantor of </F> Stability in the Caucasus, or Why People at the Georgian Embassy  Prefer a Swiss Bottle Opener to a Russian One"]    [Text] At last! That is the only way to react to the  signing in Moscow of two agreements between Georgia and Abkhazia  which have inspired hope, on both banks of the Inguri, of a  long-awaited peace.    Eduard Bruner [name as transliterated], personal  representative of the UN secretary general, particularly  stressed the peacemaking efforts by Russian diplomacy, as a  result of which a major step has been taken toward peace in an  explosive region of the Caucasus.    A press conference was held on this topic at the Georgian  Embassy in Moscow. The significance of the event was confirmed  by the number of journalists, who virtually filled the  conference hall at No. 6, Paliashvili.    Aleksandr Kavsadze, personal representative of the Georgian  head of state and leader of Georgia's official delegation to the  talks, noted at the press conference that the success of the  Moscow meeting was determined largely by Sukhumi's flexible  stance, and also by a compromise and a series of concessions by  Tbilisi.    He stressed that the agreement on the return of refugees to  Abkhazia is an amnesty for those who did fight but have laid  down their arms and promised not to take them up again.  However, according to Aleksandr Kavsadze, it does not apply to  those who committed atrocities or acts of robbery and looting,  or to those who are today entertaining plans to resume  hostilities.    The view was also expressed at the press conference at the  Georgian Embassy that those people -- in both Georgia and  Abkhazia -- who are responsible for kindling a fratricidal civil  war and who have profited by this dirty business, should suffer  the criminal punishment they deserve.    The remarks at the press conference by Vakhtang  Rcheuleshvili, vice speaker of the Georgian Supreme Council,  struck me as original, to put it mildly. After demonstrating  from the stage his unsuccessfull attempts to open a bottle of  Borzhomi [Georgian mineral water] with a Russian bottle opener,  he then, with one graceful movement, opened the bottle with a  similar, but Swiss-made, tool. That is how it is at the talks,  the vice speaker observed with irritation. And then he  explained: All the agreements between Georgia and Abkhazia  where Russia was present at the signing as intermediary, led to  no positive results -- on the contrary, they culminated in  bloody armed actions and military defeat for the Georgian side.  But the participation of Swiss citizen Eduard Bruner, the UN  secretary general's personal representative, in the Moscow talks  produced, he said, the long-awaited success. To be fair, it  must be noted that Mr. Rcheuleshvili, on failing to observe a  rapturous reaction to this nice little "joke" among the Russian  and foreign journalists present, did say, in conclusion, that  the Georgian side is grateful to Russia for the attainment of  the agreements....    Thank you for that. We are long accustomed to see Russia's  successful peace initiatives received with irritation outside  Russia's borders. The recent success for Russian diplomacy in  the Balkans is the most graphic illustration of this. Although  it should be noted that not a word was said aloud about this.  The artistic performance with the Borzhomi at No. 6,  Paliashvili, and the unequivocal remarks by the vice speaker of  the Georgian Supreme Council prompt the thought that some people  in Tbilisi would prefer to see Western representatives at the  talks in the role of peacemaker, rather than Russia. Here it  must be noted that the opposition in the Georgian Supreme  Council, according to recent reports from Tbilisi, greeted the  signing of the peace agreements in a generally hostile fashion.    Being a peacemaker is certainly a thankless task: When two  people are fighting, they are never happy with a third.  However, I would like to point out to Mr. Rcheuleshvili that if  aliens from another planet were to appear at the negotiating  table in the role of intermediaries, even they could not act as  unshakable guarantors of peace in the Caucasus. It all depends  primarily on the two warring parties and their true desire to  reach an agreement and a peace.    On the same day I met with Sergey Bagapsh, first deputy  chairman of the Abkhaz Council of Ministers. He expressed  satisfaction with the results of the Moscow talks and stressed  the beneficial influence of Russian diplomacy in arriving at the  two Georgian-Abkhaz agreements that have been signed. Without  Russia's participation the CSCE and UN representatives could not  have achieved this important task, he concluded.    For my part, let me note that I did not notice a Swiss  bottle  opener in the hands of the first vice premier of Abkhazia. Nor,  incidentally, a bottle of Georgian Borzhomi.</p>

Suggested Proposal Format  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In order to expedite the proposal review and selection process, EPA suggests that facilities use the following format to organize their proposals:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1_Table of Contents, 1 page.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 2_Executive Summary, 1&hyph;2 pages.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 3_Main Narrative, organized by the seven criteria and containing a clear statement of pilot project goals, 25&hyph;30 pages maximum.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 4_Exhibits and Attachments, 25&hyph;30 pages.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 5_Bibliography of Supporting Material, including a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> list <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of local, State, and Federal permits, and a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> list <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of applicable Federal technology-based standards, 3&hyph;5 pages. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Role of the States  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> States have been invited to work in partnership with EPA in the pilot project phase; the pilots will be more likely to succeed if EPA and States work in concert. EPA recognizes that States' level of involvement may vary according to available resources. The Agency strongly encourages candidate facilities to contact their State environmental agency as soon as possible to express their intention to prepare a pilot project proposal, and to begin discussions about the State's role, including opportunities to build on existing partnerships and programs. Strong proposals will include documentation showing that the proposal has been reviewed, sponsored, or endorsed by the appropriate State agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Recognizing the valuable role of States as laboratories for new approaches to environmental protection, EPA is eager to have significant State participation in the pilot effort. A number of States have already expressed interest in working with EPA to further develop the ELP concept. As of the date of this notice, the following States have approached EPA and offered to work as partners in the pilot project effort:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Alaska  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Arizona  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Massachusetts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;New York  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;North Carolina  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Washington  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Contact people for these States are listed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has invited  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> all <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  States to participate in the ELP, and is actively working to build additional partnerships. Facilities in States not listed here are encouraged to contact their State environmental agency as soon as possible to express their intention to prepare a pilot project proposal, and to begin discussions about the State's role, including opportunities to build on existing partnerships and programs. EPA recognizes that States may not be able to, or may choose not to, become involved in the pilot project phase. The Agency will keep all States informed of the status of the pilot projects on a regular basis, and, during the next phase of the projects, will convene a workshop to discuss the pilot experience, ideas for launching a possible full-scale leadership program, and other ideas for further expanding the leadership/excellence concept.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Role of EPA Regions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA Regions have also been invited by the Office of Compliance to participate in the pilot project effort. In this phase of the ELP, Regional involvement may vary according to available resources. At a minimum, Regions will play a role in the screening and review of proposals. Through the pilot projects, EPA hopes to more accurately gauge the level of resources necessary for Regional participation in any future full-scale program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each Region's ELP contact is listed below. Interested facilities should contact their Region as soon as possible to express their intention to prepare a pilot project proposal, and to begin discussions about the Region's role, including opportunities to build on existing partnerships and programs. More general questions about the ELP pilot project phase should be directed to the Headquarters contacts listed at the beginning of this notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

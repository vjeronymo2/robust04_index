			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Alfred McAlpine shows 61% fall to Pounds 3.6m ALFRED McAlpine, the UK construc-tion group which is still seeking a new chief executive, yesterday announced a 61 per cent fall in pre-tax profits and a cut in its final dividend of more than a third. The group's share price fell 8p to close at 131p following the announcement that the pre-tax surplus had fallen from Pounds 9.3m to Pounds 3.6m for the year ended October 31 1992. Profits would have been higher but for a Pounds 2m exceptional provision mostly to cover redundancy costs. Mr Graeme Odgers, who is quitting as chief executive to become chairman of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, said that the final dividend would be reduced from 5.8p to 3.5p making a total of 6.5p (10.3p) for the year. Earnings per share fell from 14.1p to 5.1p. Interest charges were down from Pounds 5.3m to Pounds 2.6m following a Pounds 39m 1-for-2 rights issue in 1991. Turnover fell from Pounds 620.8m to Pounds 560.7m. Mr Odgers said that the group had drawn up a short list of three highly qualified candidates for the chief executive's job and expected to make an announcement shortly. The group said that it expected profits to increase in the current year, although it would incur a loss in the first half. The UK construction market remained very difficult, which was affecting McAlpine's contracting and minerals operations. Construction profits last year fell from Pounds 13m to Pounds 1.5m, while profits from minerals dropped from Pounds 4.2m to Pounds 1.9m. Mr Odgers expected little improvement to be made in the current year. The outlook for UK housing and the US was more promising, he said. The number of house sales agreed by the group had jumped by 30 per cent since January 1 compared with the corresponding period. Housing, which made Pounds 2.6m (Pounds 1.2m loss), returned its first profit for years. US profits had slipped from Pounds 2.3m to Pounds 1.9m but were also expected to do better this year. Net debt averaged Pounds 49m during the last financial year, equivalent to 29 per cent of shareholders' funds of Pounds 170m. Net debt in the current year was expected to average about Pounds 65m, reflecting the purchase of the 40 per cent minority in the housing business, the affect of currency movements and lower cash inflows from contracting. COMMENT McAlpine under Graeme Odgers' tenure has done all the right things. Debt has been reduced, overheads cut and a clear well-defined business development strategy introduced including expansion of overseas construction interests. All of this has been recognised in the McAlpine share price, which slid yesterday on news of the dividend cut and Mr Odgers' unfavourable comments about the state of the UK contracting and building material markets. Profits nonetheless could rise to Pounds 6m this year and might even reach Pounds 7m. This would provide earnings of between 7p and 8p leaving a maintained dividend fully covered. A prospective p/e of between 16 and 18 would suggest that the stock remains fully valued despite yesterday's slide in the share price.</p>

			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Letter: Britain's narrowly educated accountants trail the international field Sir, The problem identified by Christopher Lorenz ('The sum total adds up to more than figures', March 6) is made worse in Britain because our very large numbers of accountants are much less well educated than those in other countries. Only recently have most of them been graduates; even now I would expect very large numbers of them to have given up science subjects at about 14. Engineers and others can learn about accountancy at any business school, and they do. Anyone who has done O-level arithmetic can understand accounting procedures, if not be an expert on tax avoidance, balance sheet cosmetics, takeover financing and other attributes which really account for the dominant position of accountants. That is due to the continual invention of both Labour and Conservative governments of new financial traps, tax laws and, occasionally, incentive grants of allowances involving labyrinthine processes of application. There is nowhere for accountants to learn about technology. A few years ago I realised this and ran an experimental Technology Summer School at Templeton College Oxford, with the college's full support. It was aimed at bankers and accountants. A group of front ranking scientists in their 30s was assembled and a programme of introduction to scientific and technological thinking designed. Hundreds of letters were sent to chairmen, managing directors, financial directors and others in companies, banks and accountancy practices. The first participants were all nominated by a small and select number of chairmen of their companies. If the letter got to finance directors or 'directors of human resources', they tended to reply that 'the school did not meet any of their closely targeted training needs'. However, we were offering education, not training. In fact, the school was judged by participants (in response to very detailed interrogation) to be most successful, but ran at a loss for the first year. We could not attract sufficient nominations for the second year to make it pay its way, and the idea was dropped. Attempts are being made to broaden secondary education. Engineers and technologists have plenty of opportunities to learn about finance and economics. What a pity that business schools are not in a position to broaden the education of our narrow accountants. Peter McGregor, McGregor and Associates, PO Box 93, Abingdon OX13 5JE</p>

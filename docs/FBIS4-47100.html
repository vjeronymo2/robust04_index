			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aldona Svirbutaviciute: "Those Who Are Able, </F> Don't Want To, While Those Who Want To, Aren't Able"]    [Text] While the new ministerial portfolios are being  assigned in the lobbies, Seimas managed to ratify the future  number of ministers. There will be not 18, as we reported a week  ago, but 19. A Ministry of Environmental Protection will be  established on June 15, and in the middle of July the Ministry  of Culture and Education will be divided into two -- a Ministry  of Culture and a Ministry of Education and Science. Around  autumn a Ministry of Government Reform and Local Administration  will be established. (Just last week it was said only two new  ministers would be appointed.)    Discussions are taking place in the Seimas corridors, and  not  only there, about potential candidates for the ministerial  posts. The Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party [LDDP] members of  Seimas became acquainted with several of them on Monday at a  meeting of their faction.    I interviewed faction members and asked them to answer a few  questions. Seimas member V. Petkevicius described Albertas  Vasiliauskas, the future minister of forestry, very positively.  He said that the candidate is both a scientist and a man of  practical affairs, who understands very well the problems of  both commercial forestry and nature conservation. "In the end,  the decision on ministerial candidates is not made by  Petkevicius alone or Rupeika alone. That is a prerogative of the  president and the government," said the author.    The faction may voice its opinion about the future  candidates, but it will not be they who make the decision.    In V. Petkevicius's opinion, it is necessary to split the  ministries of education and culture. He said with a laugh that  the present minister sits on two chairs; one day he sits with  education administrators, then on the next with a group of  cultural workers.    A. Lozuraitis, a member of the LDDP faction's hierarchy,  also  gave his opinion. He said that the discussion in the faction  does not constitute a final decision. It is quite possible that  other candidates exist or will appear. "It is very complicated  to talk about aspirants in advance, because there is often a  conflict of strong, passionate opinions. You can't hide the fact  that some persons are patrons of certain candidates, proposing  and pushing them, while others criticize them. So this process  does not have a clear procedure so far. Neither the faction, nor  Seimas appoints the ministers, but there is a striving to make  the search for ministers more public, respecting everyone's  opinion," said A. Lozuraitis.    A. Kuncinas, the assistant head of the faction, said that a  businesslike conversation had taken place on Monday with the  ministerial candidates, who had answered questions. According to  him, the faction does not make any decisions, it can only  express its opinion to the prime minister, who is the chairman  of the party. A. Kuncinas said that the ministers will be  discussed again in the faction and in the party presidium.    By the way, we found out that the list of ministerial  candidates is far longer than was known until now. A ministerial  post (in the Ministry of Education and Science) is being offered  to A. Lozuraitis. Asked to comment about this news, he said:    - That always flatters one's ego, but one must know one's  limitations. I took this proposal to be a humorous one... I  don't consider it serious...    - Is that possible? After all, it's doubtful that the  persons  who made the proposal did it as a joke.    - I think that they know me less well than I know myself.    A. Kuncinas, the assistant head of the faction, summarized  this mini-interview: "That's the way it is. Those who could be a  minister don't want to, while sometimes those who are pushing to  get the post are not capable of heading a ministry... "</p>

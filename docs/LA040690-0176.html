			<p><P> April 6, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> A STRIKING SUBJECT  </P> <P> What's in store for Angel fans as the team begins its seventh season affected,  in one way or another, by labor unrest? If history is indicative, it could be a  long season. In 1985, the last time there were such problems, the team ended up  just one game out of first. Before that, however, their showing was a good deal  less stellar. Here's how those labor-troubled seasons compare:  </P> <P> </P> <P> Year: 1969  </P> <P> Type of Labor Unrest: 10-day player boycott of spring training  </P> <P> Number of Regular Season Games Affected: 0  </P> <P> Angels' Won-Loss Record: 71-91  </P> <P> Rank in the A.L.

West Standings: ?  </P> <P> Number of Games Out of First Place: ?  </P> <P> </P> <P> ANGEL DUST SETTLED  </P> <P> Except 1985, when they finished a game out of first place, the Angels have  played five other seasons marred by strike, boycott or lockout since the  introduction of divisional play in 1969. They finished an average of more than  20 games behind the Western Division leaders and only as high as third (at  that, 26 games behind). In the 15 other seasons since 1969 (during which they  won three divisional titles), the Halos have finished on average 14 games out  of first.  </P> <P> * Season with labor problems  </P> <P> Source: The Baseball Encyclopedia, Joseph L.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Fayina Zlotnyk: "We Will Get $6 Million More"] </F>   [Text] The Ukrainian Environmental Protection Ministry  press center reported that Yuriy Kostenko, minister for  protection of Ukrainian environment, returned from an official  trip to the Netherlands and the United States.    During his stay in the Netherlands, a memorandum was signed  on ecologic cooperation between the Ukrainian Ministry of  Environmental Protection, and the Ministry of Construction,  Territorial Planning and Environment, the Ministry of  Transportation, Public Works and Water Management, and the  Ministry of Agriculture, Fishing and Nature of the Netherlands.    This memorandum provides for cooperation in the sphere of  ecologic management and the protection of air, water, and  wildlife. It was agreed that a working cooperation program for  1994-95 will be approved in early April.    In the United States, where Yuriy Kostenko was invited to  visit the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, he met with  officials from this agency, the World Bank, the Agency for  International Development, the Department of Energy, and the  U.S. Congress.    The U.S. officials displayed a deep interest in cooperation  between Ukraine and the United States in the sphere of ecology,  and examined a package of proposals about urgent environmental  protection measures, such as the creation of modern laboratories  monitoring radiation levels and water quality, recycling of  toxic waste, launching educational television programs, and  finally establishing an informational and educational center.  The American side is planning to allocate $6 million to  implement the above projects. This will be an addition to the  $500,000 that the World Bank granted the Environmental Ministry  last year to carry out a project called "Preservation of  Biological Diversity of Carpathians." The American colleagues  are ready to continue to share with us their experience and  technologies, and want to train our specialists and provide  financial assistance.</p>

			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Company News (This Week): Events in Japan add to worries over sector switch - Inchcape So far, 1994 has not been a happy year for Inchcape, the international motors, marketing and business services group. Its share price has fallen by a third since January, and analysts will be anxious for reassurance today when the UK-based group reports results for the six months to June 30. Currency has been the main bugbear. Inchcape does a lot of its business in and from the Far East and the strength of Japanese yen against both the dollar and sterling will adversely depress its results. The Japanese recession hit the group's marketing activities, which also suffered when the Chinese authorities last year imposed austerity measures to slow the pace of development in their southern provinces. Inchcape has also been rueing its loss last year of a tussle with the FT-SE Actuaries Industry Classification Committee, which led to the group being moved from business services sector to vehicle distributors. Following its acquisition of TKM for Pounds 383m in 1992, Inchcape group makes the bulk of its operating profits from motors importing, distribution, and retailing. However, it was concerned over being put in a sector which mainly comprises UK distributors, when only about 15 per cent of the group's total profits come from motors in the UK. Sure enough, when news of the disappointing level of new car registrations in the UK during August hit its new sector this month, Inchcape was clobbered along with companies which trade only in the UK. These concerns have wiped out the premium rating which Inchcape enjoyed in the early 1990s, when the market saw it as well placed to benefit from growth in the Pacific Rim and - through Hong Kong - the development of China. Analysts expect pre-tax profits of about Pounds 115m-Pounds 120m, compared with Pounds 130m last time, but will be more interested in the outlook for the second half.</p>

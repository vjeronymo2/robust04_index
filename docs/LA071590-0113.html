			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHY I CANNOT BEGIN, DEAR FRIEND  </P> <P> by ROBERT McNAMARA  </P> <P> Perhaps I heard nothing all those years, saw you for myself,  </P> <P> her friend and mine, joining us in food and close talk,  </P> <P> or those brilliant summer afternoons. Perhaps  </P> <P> I knew you were making love to her the way one knows that  </P> <P> the man on the bench is waiting for no one, though  </P> <P> he looks at his watch, taps his foot, folds and unfolds  </P> <P> his paper. I've wanted to kill you, and some days the sound  </P> <P> of people I love talking in the next room, talking in the  </P> <P> cautious  </P> <P> tones of the half-empty elevator, leaning so that the breath  </P> <P> and flicker of the lips arouse the listener's ear,  </P> <P> is enough. You say that you loved us both,  </P> <P> I would not trap her or another, yet who does not know  </P> <P> how resolutely we dress for hard weather, and the soft place  </P> <P> we shelter underneath? Did you think you could swallow  </P> <P> these contradictions? Love may be a crane or a sparrow,  </P> <P> this hard place, that blackness expanding, drawing us all in  </P> <P> and down. I wonder how you spoke to yourself  </P> <P> as we walked the beach, or alone in your room, looking out  </P> <P> toward  </P> <P> the wavebreak, or in. What true beginning did you compose  </P> <P> for this doubling middle? I loved you, was touched  </P> <P> by your griefs then, such as you opened,  </P> <P> joyed as I could in what happiness you allowed yourself  </P> <P> to feel or say. Asking what was there: this wound is deepest,  </P> <P> was least expected, will be last to heal. Do not imagine  </P> <P> this will change, or wait on this sky, these clouds hanging  </P> <P> an unflattering backdrop for the trees. I can't forgive you  </P> <P> this distance, wanting, this wound,  </P> <P> no more.  </P> <P> From "Second Messengers" (Wesleyan University Press: $20, cloth, $9.95, paper;  0-8195-1184-6).

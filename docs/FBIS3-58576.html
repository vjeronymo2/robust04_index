This attitude, Acarkan noted, gives a clear  indication of the desire to obtain results in Cyprus through the  use of force rather than through negotiations.    In a written statement issued today, Acarkan said that when  confidence-building measures are on the agenda and when the  world's attention is turning toward Cyprus, we are witnessing a  new example of the extent to which the Greek Cypriots differ  from the confidence-building concept. He pointed out that it  has again become evident that the Greek Cypriot-Greek side  encourages and aggravates nonconfidence, rather than creates  trust.    The contradictions contained in the statements issued on  this  subject are tantamount to poking fun at the world, unless they  are a manifestation of guilty feelings, Acarkan remarked.  Recalling that the Greek Cypriots first stated that joint Greek  Cypriot-Greek military exercises will be conducted within the  framework of the joint defense doctrine, and then they denied  this and claimed that the Greek commandos came to vacation in  Cyprus, Acarkan said this is the first time in history that  fully armed military units have been taken on vacation.    The Assembly speaker advised the Greek Cypriot-Greek side to  contribute sincerely contribute to the quest for peace and to  refrain from actions that may aggravate the lack of confidence.</p>

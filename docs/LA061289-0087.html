			<p><P> June 12, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Rock star Jon Bon Jovi's parents have started a scholarship named after their  son to help aspiring artists attending his old high school. John and Carol  Bongiovi said that the "Jon Bon Jovi Dare to Dream Scholarship" will be awarded  to artistic students at Sayreville War Memorial High School. They would not  disclose how much money was involved in the scholarship. The family will  provide initial seed money for the scholarship fund, which will be supplemented  by fund-raising events organized by students, said Jim Robinson, a school  planning board chairman. Mrs. Bongiovi said potential scholarship recipients  didn't necessarily have to be rock 'n' roll singers: "It could be a kid who  likes to hammer the piano all day long and is driving everybody nuts."

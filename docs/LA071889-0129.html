			<p><P> July 18, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Ferruzzi Releases Letters: Ferruzzi S.p.A., the Italian agricultural giant that  plans to sue the Chicago Board of Trade after being ordered to liquidate large  positions in soybean futures, released letters of protest in support of its  free-market stance from the grain buying agencies of the Soviet Union and  China. Several independent traders and firms have privately come out in support  of Ferruzzi in its dispute with the Board of Trade's directors after they voted  last week to force holders of July soybean contracts to liquidate those  positions to prevent a possible default. The exchange's order drove the price  of the July contract down sharply, prompting Ferruzzi to promise a lawsuit to  recover the losses.  </P></p>

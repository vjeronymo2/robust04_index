			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / EC aid may jeopardise established grants, MEP warns A LEADING MEP yesterday warned that the government has put European grants to older areas of industrial decline in jeopardy by also seeking grants for places such as Brighton, Bristol and Edinburgh. Mr Wayne David, Labour MEP for South Wales and vice-chairman of the European parliament's regional policy committee, said he feared Britain's traditional industrial areas could lose out under the government's 'Objective 2' area submission, sent recently to the European Commission, and due to be published on Monday. Inclusion on the map, which covers areas of industrial decline, gives access to grants from the European regional development fund and the European social fund. Between 1989-93, parts of Britain that qualified for Objective 2 grants received a total of Pounds 2.39bn, 38 per cent of the European Community total. Mr David claimed that the present UK submission included Brighton, Southend, Portsmouth, Weymouth, Bristol, Edinburgh, parts of inner London, and also Gibraltar, as well as areas such as north-east and north-west England, central Scotland, the west Midlands and south Wales. At present, nowhere in the south of England qualifies for Objective 2 grants. A map to take effect from January is now being produced. It will cover no more than 15 per cent of the EC population, but Mr David said member states' submissions total 22 per cent. The map covers just over 16 per cent at the moment. He said: 'It means the traditional industrial areas are effectively competing with these new areas the government has submitted. Some of these new areas have very real problems - that has to be recognised - but I don't believe they should be helped at the expense of the older areas. I fear that will happen.' The EC has allocated a total of Pounds 10.7bn for Objective 2 grants between 1994 and 1999. The grants cover up to 50 per cent of the cost of projects to assist economic and social regeneration. The Department of Trade and Industry received hundreds of representations from areas anxious to retain or gain Objective 2 status. The places concerning Mr David are not on the government's assisted areas map, which determines eligibility for UK government aid. EC criteria for Objective 2 status include unemployment, falls in industrial employment and substantial recent or threatened job losses. It is believed that more UK places have been submitted than are expected to qualify. The DTI refused to confirm Mr David's information but said: 'The commission will choose what areas stay on the list and what areas have to be knocked off.' The EC is also redrawing its Objective 5b map, covering rural areas experiencing transitional problems.</p>

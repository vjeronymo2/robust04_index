			<p><P> June 30, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: BUSALACCHI'S IS A BRIGHT STAR AMONG ITALIAN  RESTAURANTS IN S.D.  </P> <P> "Where do you like to go for Italian?" is a common question, the answer to  which follows easily enough. Several places come to mind, and one of them is  Busalacchi's, the Hillcrest trattoria that speaks Italian with a heavy Sicilian  accent.  </P> <P> Like Sophia Loren, Busalacchi's has mature good looks. It occupies a house of  some age that shows its years to advantage, and the small dining rooms manage  to be comfortable and intimate even when the place is bustling, which seems to  be much of the time.  </P> <P> The restaurant's chief physical attraction, however, is the canopied terrace,  heated during the evening to make outdoor dining not just possible, but  pleasant. This handsome, well-appointed terrace definitely gives Busalacchi's  some of its edge over the competition.  </P> <P> Chef-proprietor Joe Busalacchi was born in Sicily and spent his early years  there, and his menu is in many ways the only in town to emphasize the  specialties of that large, historied island in the Mediterranean. All the  typical Italian foods, such as olive oil, garlic and tomatoes are present, but  these in truth are general throughout the Mediterranean, and the Sicilian touch  shows up both in a distinctive approach to seasoning and in specific regional  recipes.  </P> <P> A bread that may not be specifically Sicilian but is decidedly delicious is  offered hot, and replenished as needed; this is focaccia, interpreted here as a  flat, relatively course dough dusted heavily with crushed garlic. The one  problem with it is that one piece invites a chaser, and so on, and it is easy  enough to fill up before the main course of the meal arrives.  </P> <P> The very first dish mentioned on the menu is at once a signature dish of  Sicilian cuisine and Busalacchi's most startling creation. This is caponata, a  kind of fresh preserve or relish of eggplant, tomato, capers, olives and celery  that can be served at any temperature but is best at room temperature, the way  Busalacchi's serves it. The list of ingredients may sound unremarkable, but  when properly combined, the result is ravishing; like many eggplant dishes,  caponata has a meaty quality and is deeply savory.  </P> <P> The appetizer list, in fact, neatly sets the tone followed by the rest of menu.  There is a strong emphasis on squid (fried or stuffed), repeated later in the  entree section, and on artichokes, also simply breaded and fried or stuffed  with a sweet-savory mix of bread crumbs, Parmesan, raisins and pine nuts.  </P> <P> Pine nuts and raisins, a very typical Sicilian combination, turn up repeatedly,  even in the bucatini con sardi, a regional specialty that tops a particularly  elegant shape of macaroni with sardines, fennel, pine nuts, raisins and a light  tomato sauce. Some of the 17 other pasta choices are more familiar -- linguine  with pesto, fettuccine Alfredo and the bolognese, or macaroni in a too  mild-mannered meat sauce -- but most are a step or more off the beaten track.  </P> <P> There is, for example, the spaghetti alla melanzane, which includes slices of  eggplant as well as tomato sauce, and the pasta al Palermo, which tosses  tubular penne with a highly aromatic sauce of capers, garlic, olives, tomato  and sausage. The pasta tossed with ricotta cheese and marinara sauce is a calm,  nicely mannered dish that sits at the opposite end of the spectrum from the  pasta genovese, an unusual (for these parts) creation of noodles garnished with  green beans and potatoes. Pungent pesto (a basil, garlic, nut and olive oil  paste) is added to bring the dish together.  </P> <P> Green beans and potatoes team again, this time with tomatoes and sliced red  onions, in the Sicilian potato salad, a dish that might sound too heavy to be  taken as a starter course. One friend of Sicilian heritage did just that,  though, chattering happily all the while about how it reminded her of her  mother's Sicilian potato salad. Oregano, rather than basil, seasons the dish.  </P> <P> The entrees sampled on two recent visits were serviceable rather than  brilliant, and the one that earned the highest favor was a simple calamari  steak piccata, or sauteed squid filet fished with mushrooms, lemon, parsley and  and a sauce of its sauteing butter enriched with white wine. This is a classic  Italian preparation that works equally well with chicken and veal (the menu  offers both) and is always a pleasure when properly done.  </P> <P> The stuffed squid, or conical torsos packed with the sweet-savory paste  mentioned above, were nice enough, but the sort of thing one might want to try  but once. The filling lacked punch, and in any case, squid prepared in this  manner tends to retain a strong hint of its innately rubbery nature.  </P> <P> The seafood listing also offers a couple of fairly typical shrimp dishes  (breaded and fried, and sauteed with lemon, garlic, mushrooms and capers) and  several fish of the day, typically finished with oil, garlic, lemon and, in  some cases, oregano.  </P> <P> The most specifically Sicilian choices among the meat entrees are the vitello  con melanzane and the spiedini, which take radically different approaches to  the basic theme of breaded veal scallops. The vitello con melanzane is much the  same as a cutlet Parmigiana, except that it includes a slice of prosciutto and  another of fried eggplant between the veal base and the cheese and tomato sauce  topping; no one ingredient really stood out, however. The spiedini method rolls  breaded veal slices around provolone cheese, scallions and salami, then breads  the bundles and finishes them on the charcoal grill. This is an excellent  recipe, but the finished product seemed dry, and the crumbs were not crisp and  brown like they would have been had they been basted with oil or melted butter.  </P> <P> The dessert tray runs to elaborate ice cream fantasies catered from  off-premises, and tiny, fragile and elegant cannoli prepared by Chef  Busalacchi's mother. These last add up to only a couple of delicious mouthfuls,  which is all one may want after one of the restaurant's copious meals.  </P> <P> BUSALACCHI'S  </P> <P> 3683 5th Ave., San Diego  </P> <P> 298-0119 (reservations suggested)  </P> <P> Lunch Monday through Friday, dinner served nightly.  </P> <P> Credit cards accepted.  </P> <P> Dinner for two, including a moderate bottle of wine, tax and tip, $40 to $75.  </P></p>

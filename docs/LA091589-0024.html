			<p><P> September 15, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> STATUE COULD BLUR MESSAGE OF BELL  </P> <P> As a former resident of San Pedro, I fail to understand how a Gargantuan  memorial depicting the horror side of war can ever possibly be a memorial that  educates people how to achieve peace, which is what (Los Angeles Cultural  Affairs) Commissioner (Alan) Sieroty has indicated he would prefer.  </P> <P> Young children tend to idolize and imitate scenes such as will be depicted and  honored, if this sculpture is placed anywhere.  </P> <P> If one really wants to educate for peace rather than war, how much better it  would be to take the ridiculous amount of money to be spent on this sculpture  (the sculptor in his own words has shown he is not altruistic about his art)  and establish an endowment fund to be used for scholarships for the study of  peace in a California college. With only the interest of the fund to be used,  the studies for attaining peace would be far more meaningful and lasting than  any bronze statue.  </P> <P> The Freedom Bell was a gift from the people of South Korea to the people of San  Pedro. It is a far more vast meaning for peace than any picture depicting war  could ever mean.  </P> <P> To dwarf that beautiful serene memorial would not only demean its meaning, but  overpower it. The bell is visible from afar. To confuse visitors would only  lessen the real reason of peace and friendship.  </P> <P> Please reconsider and get the whole war scene memorial completely out of San  Pedro.  </P> <P> MAZIE JEANNE GEORGE  </P> <P> Anderson, CA  </P></p>

			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Algiers mosque surrounded in crackdown GOVERNMENT forces yesterday tightened their clampdown on Algeria's Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), surrounding an Algiers mosque during prayers and manning road blocks on routes into the city. The weekly prayer services were the first since an army-dominated security council cancelled elections that were expected to give the FIS control of Parliament. FIS leaders claimed that 500 party supporters had been arrested since Tuesday. Although witnesses reported several arrests during a day which passed peacefully, there is no independent verification of the opposition claim. Special units of the Algerian army surrounded the Es Sunna mosque in the Bab El Oued district, one of the FIS strongholds, armed soldiers standing a few yards apart. Speaking during prayers, the provisional FIS leader, Mr Abdelkader Hachani, called for calm, urged followers to resist provocation, and reminded the government that the Front had won an election conducted under the authorities' own rules. 'They want to make us rise up, but they won't succeed,' he said. 'If they want to arrest us, arrest us. If they want to kill us, kill us. . . But the Islamic state will triumph.' With an irony that would not have been lost on followers who have heard their leaders denounce the constitution in the past, Mr Hachani told Algeria's new administration: 'We respected your constitution. . . You were the ones who violated it.' He also dismissed Mr Mohamed Boudiaf, who returned on Thursday after a 27-year exile in Morocco, to preside over a five-man collegiate presidency, as a 'foreign import'. The clampdown came just a day after Mr Boudiaf and the defence minister. Mr Khaled Nezzar, warned people not to use Islam for self-interest. Yesterday political parties continued yesterday to conduct a series of formal and informal exchanges. It emerged that late on Thursday evening Mr Hocine Ait Ahmed, the leader of one of the lay opposition parties, the Front des Forces Socialistes (FFS), met FIS leaders. He did not consult the party's ruling council before doing so, and three of its members promptly denounced their leader's action. Many of Mr Aid Ahmed's supporters appear dismayed by such contacts. Mr Abdelhamid Mehri, the secretary general of the National Liberation Front (FLN), one of the main losers of the events of the past few days, has also met FIS leaders. Several FLN militants have denounced such contacts, but the party which has enjoyed office for nearly 30 years seems prepared to go to great lengths to retain a share of power. But most observers doubt that the three main parties - the FLN, FIS and FFS  -could form any lasting alliance, given their very different aims and constituencies.</p>

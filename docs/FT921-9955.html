			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Hawks and Handsaws: Budget reaction latest LIKE A trawlerman harvesting mackerel, I hauled in a wriggling catch of pre-post-Budget quotes this week. The UK Budget is still 4 1/2 weeks away. But to stay ahead of the news I deem it imperative to strike hard and strike early. In the age of information, only those journalists who get ahead of the news, who anticipate its twists and turns with high-class speculation, stand a chance of elevating themselves above the slavering pack. So I rang various celebrities to get their Budget reactions in the hope of repeating last year's coup. Last year's Budget was on March 19. Yet on March 9, Hawks &amp; Handsaws quoted Labour leader Neil Kinnock as follows: 'The decision to . . . boost VAT was particularly sensitive, thoughtful and statesmanlike.' As I recollect, only Hawks &amp; Handsaws predicted last year's swingeing increase in VAT. But enough of dusty triumphs. Here are this year's pre-post-Budget quotes: Prime minister John Major: 'Thank you very much for ringing me on the telephone and asking me my opinion. Above all, this was a Budget of prudence and caution. There are signs, as you know, that Finland and the Maldives, to name just two, are emerging from recession, and from that we can take cheer. But it would not have been appropriate at this particular juncture to pump up the volume in the UK economy. That is why we raised most categories of indirect taxation yet left income tax alone. As a country we cannot spend what we have not earned. That is what Helmut tells me, and I repose the utmost confidence in his particular views. Thank you for telephoning me.' Neil Kinnock: 'I have to say that I found this a statesmanlike Budget, thoughtful and well-crafted, caring and finely-tuned, in short, a carbon copy of the Budget we would have presented if the Tories hadn't run scared and refused to face the country at the ballot box, stand up and be counted, 13 wasted years of Tory mis-rule and mis-management, squandering Britain's assets, if, as I say, the Tories had had the guts to call an early election then a Budget like this, caring and well-crafted, is very much the Budget that a Labour government led by me would have been proud to present.' Wing Commander Paddy Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Democrats: 'Nine out of ten. A compassionate, caring Budget. The fact that the Tories have stolen the Liberal Democrats' clothes is not something I wish to comment on.' Environment secretary Michael Heseltine: 'This was not the right Budget. I admire John Major personally, but he is like a cricket captain who takes to the field with insufficient bowlers, insufficient batting strength, no wicket-keeper, six silly mid-ons and a vague hope that rain will stop play before tea-time. Did you get that, Michael, or shall I read it to you again?' Transport secretary Malcolm Rifkind: 'Go away] Go away]]' Opposition Trade spokesman Gordon Brown: 'What a snivelling Budget. We are back where we started at the onset of the Tory Terror 13 years ago. But the tumbrels are greased, the guillotine hovers sharp. Away with these disgraced tyrants and their lip-sync charters.' As you can imagine, talking to politicians soon gets fatiguing. So I turned, once again, to the sharp end of British novel-writing for some red-corpuscled quotes: Ian McEwan: 'Did you see Norman Lamont's speech? Were you watching when he closed his eyes and breathed deeply, as though inhaling a fragrance. Then he said in a reasonable way: 'Let me re-order the facts.'' Nicholas Mosley: 'We do not want to be made better. We want to become worse, to make an end of it.' Nigel Williams, author of The Wimbledon Poisoner: 'Who expected happiness? The people with yachts and penthouses and as much sex as they want and shares and private beaches and planes constantly at their disposal and suntans and fantastic digestions are not, most of them, happy. Oh no. Happiness is a more complex emotion than that.' Gordon Burn, author of Alma Cogan: 'Reality has been digitised and broken down into megabits or bongobytes, then replayed as a kind of endless fidgeting or fluttering on the periphery of experience, at the edge of vision. Motes dancing on the air. That's what I see. That's what I seem to be constantly seeing.' Pete Davies, author of Dollarville: 'This ain't no way to run a railroad.' Helen Simpson, author of Four Bare Legs In a Bed: 'If you ask me, John Major carries a lightbulb round in his pocket to illuminate whichever room he is visiting for more than a few minutes.' Martin Amis's executive secretary: 'Hi there. Martin's tied up in conference but he'll fax you tonight. He knows you're time-urgent.'</p>

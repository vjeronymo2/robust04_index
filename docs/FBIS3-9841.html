			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Lubor Kohout: "The Long Ears of Our Secret </F> Service Might Stretch Even Further"]    [Text] The government draft law on the Security  Information Service [BIS] that was submitted recently to  parliament deputies is based on a single objective: to  reinforce the powers of the counterintelligence service.    The most important change is supposed to be that BIS  acquires  the right to actually build a unit that uses intelligence  technology. This means a unit that installs bugging devices of  various types, monitors telecommunications, opens and examines  correspondence, uses identification technology to control  movement, etc. So far, BIS has depended on the Interior  Ministry service in the performance of intelligence tasks. The  ministry used its own equipment when BIS requested it, just as  it did when the police requested it and formerly with the  agreement of the prosecutor--today, the judge--and it passed on  the results only to BIS. Of course, in this way, the Interior  Ministry was well informed about the activities and subjects of  interest of the Security Information Service. That apparently  is the main reason for the endeavors leading to BIS's having at  its disposal its own division of intelligence technology.  According to the Interior Ministry Press Department, a transfer  of these divisions from the Interior Ministry to BIS so that BIS  would provide the services using the intelligence means for the  Ministry is out of the question. That way, the situation would  turn around, and BIS would be informed about police actions,  which, in turn, quite understandably, the Interior Ministry does  not want.    So, it is most likely that two divisions with intelligence  technology will be formed, one to remain with the Interior  Ministry and the other to be formed by BIS. In addition to its  being a rather costly affair, even BIS cannot prevent the  participation of the Interior Ministry staffers in telephone  wiretapping, for instance--namely, the Interior Ministry  controls the so-called seventh chambers, which have been built  in the telephone exchanges. The wiretapping usually takes place  in these rooms. Hence, BIS will be independent only in the use  of some other intelligence tools. It must be observed here  that, in comparison with telephone wiretapping, the other  intelligence operations are used less frequently. Moreover,  despite the possible technical perfection, their application is  more demanding on the professional qualities of the secret  service agents.    Is there another solution that would not be so costly and  yet  remain effective? There is one, although it may seem rather  utopian and organizationally and legislatively demanding: to  separate the divisions with intelligence technology from the  Interior Ministry and not form them at BIS. The existing  divisions would be transferred as a special section to the  Supreme Court, the judges of which are currently deciding on the  employment of the intelligence technology, or, possibly, to the  State Attorney's Office. This unit would then, upon the  approval of the employment by the judge, conduct its own  service, including the use of the intelligence tools for both  the police and BIS. In addition to the obvious financial  saving, another thing would be achieved: a substantial reduction  in the possibility of an eventual illegal application of the  intelligence technology by the secret service and the police.</p>

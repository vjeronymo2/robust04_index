			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Arts: Greenwich observed - The re-opening of the observatory ABOUT A quarter of a million people a year visit the Old Royal Observatory at Greenwich and stand upon a brass line in the pavement outside. The line marks the Prime Meridian or Longitude Zero, and to straddle it is to have one foot in the eastern hemisphere and one in the western. If visitors have not given sufficient regard to the wider historical and scientific importance of the Royal Observatory, it is partly due to the outmoded displays and confusing information that has so far been available to them. This has now been corrected, for the observatory re-opens next week following the installation of new galleries and permanent exhibitions and the redecoration of the 17th century apartments. The observatory was founded by Charles II in 1675 to provide astronomical data for the improvement of navigation. The main building is known as Flamsteed House, after the first astronomer royal, John Flamsteed (1646 - 1719). The press release describes Flamsteed House as 'a masterpiece by Christopher Wren', although in fact Wren was, to quote the architectural historian John Summerson 'only in some degree responsible' for the design. As far as the alterations of earlier times allow, Flamsteed's modest personal apartments have been restored and furnished to give an impression of his occupancy. However, the jewel of Flamsteed house is the Octagon Room, above Flamsteed's apartments. Essentially a large belvedere with tall windows on all sides to allow for the 360 degree tracking of the night sky, this beautiful room has now been re-equipped with telescopes and astronomical instruments of the period. An attempt has also been made to restore the original decorative scheme. Flamsteed House was added to in the 18th and 19th centuries and adjacent buildings were built to contain the equipment required for positional measurements of the stars. The Octagon Room, although a showpiece and a statement of national pride, itwas never practical for accurate celestial cartography and Flamsteed himself constructed a small building behind the house for this purpose. Later astronomers made their own additions and since the result does not form an architectural whole, licence has been taken to thoroughly modernise the interior spaces of these later wings. The introductory galleries address the history of astronomy in general terms and the pioneering contribution of John Flamsteed in particular. Flamsteed's work in mapping the stars using a new and accurate system of measurement reveals him to be the founder of modern astronomy. His observations were of great help to Newton, with whom he later fell out when Newton and Halley (of comet fame) published some of his findings without his consent. Edmond Halley (1656-1742) succeeded Flamsteed as the second astronomer royal in 1720. However, even though these luminaries had made great progress in astronomy and certain related areas, their observations had not helped to solve that most obstinate and fundamental problem of navigation, namely how to determine longitude at sea. This basic inability to fix a position was the cause of so many disasters that Parliament established the Board of Longitude in 1714 to consider any suggestions that might be forthcoming. It also announced a Pounds 20,000 reward for anyone who could solve the problem. Enter John Harrison (1693-1776), the 300th anniversary of whose birth coincides with the re-opening of the observatory. For centuries the potential contribution of a marine chronometer had been recognised. Since the earth rotates through 360 degrees every 24 hours, if the mariner were to have a clock showing the exact time at a fixed meridian such as Greenwich, he could, knowing local time (which could easily be established by observing the position of the sun) translate the time difference between the two into degrees of longitude. Harrison, a Yorkshire carpenter, had produced a number of clocks with wooden mechanisms. He visited Edmond Halley at the Greenwich observatory with a proposal that he build a clock that would keep accurate time at sea, notwithstanding the motion of the ship and temperature variations. The story of Harrison's remarkable achievements from the successful completion of his first marine chronometer in 1736 to the time he received the full reward from the Board of Longitude reward in 1773 is a fascinating chronicle of dedication, despair and eventual vindication. His chronometers were the height of technology in their day, and it would be hard to better his own description of his final and most successful design: 'I think I make so bold as to say that there is neither any other mechanical or mathematical thing in the world that is more beautiful or curious in texture than this my watch or timekeeper for longitude.' Captain Cook took a copy of Harrison's final chronometer on his second and third voyages where it helped him to map the coasts of Australia and New Zealand with a precision that is still admired today. Harrison's four major chronometers are excellently displayed in the new galleries, each accompanied by a video that uses computer graphics to explain the principles and design of the mechanism. There is no sound track which means that the tick of the marvellous machines may be heard. John Redfern, an horologist turned producer of computer graphics, deserves the highest praise for these tapes. Video is also used to good effect in the chamber housing Sir George Airy's telescope, where it is obviously impossible to activate the machinery itself. Airy was astronomer royal between 1835 and 1881, and it is his telescope that defines Longitude Zero for the world. What finally clinched the argument in favour of Greenwich rather than, say, Paris, was that the new American railways had also started using Greenwich for their time zones. Another gallery is assigned to the London instrument makers of the 18th and 19th centuries who contributed to the scientific progress of the age with astonishing ingenuity and technical skill. A fine selection of instruments are on display with captions that make them intelligible to the layman. The re-development brings to prominence the most important monument to the scientific aspirations and achievements of the Enlightenment. And as an expression of the scientific confidence of our own age, the brass strip marking the Prime Meridian has been taken up and replaced with a line of pulsating lights. Such is the march of progress.</p>

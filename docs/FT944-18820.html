			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Fiat to form leading car parts maker in merger: Group set for return to profit, says chairman Fiat, the Italian car and industrial holding company, announced yesterday that it would merge Magneti Marelli and Gilardini, its components subsidiaries, to create a company with a turnover of L5,000bn (Pounds 205bn) which will become one of Europe's top three manufacturers of car parts. At the same time, Mr Giovanni Agnelli, Fiat's chairman, forecast that Fiat group's consolidated gross profit for the full year could reach Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m). 'The gross consolidated profit will be between L1,000bn and Dollars 1bn, I leave you to work out the exchange rate,' he said after the board meeting of Ifi, the family holding company. Last year, Fiat recorded a record loss of L1,783bn after tax, and decided not to pay a dividend on ordinary shares for the first time since 1947. Magneti Marelli will absorb Gilardini through an issue of new Gilardini shares reserved for Magneti Marelli's shareholders. Gilardini will then complete the process, which has already begun, of transferring its non-car activities to other companies within the Fiat group. The deal amounts to the biggest rationalisation of Fiat's activities since the group sold its holding in Italian retailer La Rinascente a year ago as part of a complex capital-raising exercise. But where that deal was part of a concerted effort to pull out of the trough of recession, yesterday's announcement came the day after Fiat published a first-half profit of L727bn before tax. Mr Agnelli warned that although 'the worst is past,(the situation) is still difficult, and one shouldn't think that everything is resolved. The auto (division) in spite of everything will still have slight losses'. He added: 'It's still too early to say if there will be dividends on Fiat ordinary shares.' Fiat owns some 60 per cent of Magneti Marelli and 70 per cent of Gilardini, but the rest of the stock is quoted in Milan. Both component companies' shares were suspended yesterday, before the announcement of the merger. Fiat's shares, which have been among the Milan market's strongest performers in recent weeks, fell L60 to close the day at L6,680. Under the terms of the deal, Magneti Marelli shareholders will receive two new Gilardini shares for every six Magneti Marelli shares held. The deal will be put to shareholders of the two companies on November 14 or 15. Fiat stressed yesterday that there would be no job losses at the combined group, which will employ 23,000 people. According to a joint statement issued by the two component companies, the enlarged Magneti Marelli will be the market leader in Europe for dashboards instruments, and number two for fuel injection systems, headlights and rear-view mirrors.</p>

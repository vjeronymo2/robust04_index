			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / UK Company News: New EFM trust comes to market THE STOCK market's current enthusiasm for split capital investment trusts continues with the Pounds 15m flotation of EFM Income Trust. There are two classes of shares in the trust, managed by Edinburgh Fund Managers. Zero dividend preference shares, with a par value of 25p, are being issued at 35p each. The trust will repay zero holders at 95p per share in the year 2000, a compound growth rate of 11.75 per cent. Although repayment at that level is not guaranteed, the trust will be able to do so, provided net asset value does not fall between now and 2000. The ordinary shares, issued at 65p apiece, will be entitled to all the income. EFM expects the yield on the shares to be above that on the FT-A All-Share Index. Net assets of the trust will need to grow at 6 per cent per annum compound for the shares to be repaid at the issue price in 2000. The trust will invest in the UK, with about 80 per cent in equities and the rest in convertibles, bonds and cash. Allied Provincial Securities is underwriting and sponsoring the issue, which consists of a placing of 15m of each class of share. Dealings are expected to start on April 29.</p>

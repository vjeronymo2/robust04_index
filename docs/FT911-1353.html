			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / Arts: Old and Masterly 'The supply of authentic Giovanni Bellinis is unexhaustible,' or so Lord Duveen used to assure prospective clients. Even then, in the 1920s, this was not strictly true, and it certainly is not today. Old Master dealers - and collectors - are in hot pursuit of an ever-dwindling supply of paintings, which tend to be increasingly less old and less masterly. Since its first exhibition a decade ago, however, Harari &amp; Johns has established a well-deserved reputation for finding serious pictures. It is symptomatic of the current market that the earliest painting in its tenth anniversary offering, Five Centuries of Old Master Paintings (12 Duke Street, SW1, until June 12), is a Madonna and Child with Saints by Pesellino. Gold grounds are virtually unobtainable now - although Christie's is selling an important Taddeo Gaddi on May 24. Relevant too that it is by Pesellino, not by his master Fra Filippo Lippi, by one of whose altarpieces in the Uffizi it is inspired. Similarly, we find a portrait by Biagio D'Antonio rather than Botticelli and a Landscape with Meleager and Atalanta from the hand of Giovanni Battista Viola and not Domenichino. Duveen, no doubt, would have sold these works as Lippi, Botticelli, and Domenichino. Only now is scholarship isolating distinct artistic personalities for 'circle of' painters such as Biagio and Viola. Sixteenth-century pictures outclass those of the 15th, even here. Outstanding among them is Dosso Dossi's half-length panel of St George, which only came to light in 1975. It is an intense portrait-like characterisation by the Ferrarese painter, who sets the saint against an atmospheric Giorgionesque landscape of dawn breaking above the sea. A bright foreground light pulls him out of the Stygian gloom, rendering his sleeve a brilliant gold, playing across his breastplate, picking out the hairs of his beard to concentrate on his troubled brow. Blocking the space between us is the severed head of the dragon, its hairy snout substantiated by bold strokes of pink and green. More spectacular still is St Mary Magdalen at the Sepulchre by the Brescian painter Savoldo, a glowing, golden variant of the even more seductive silvery treatment of the subject in the National Gallery. The Magdalen is depicted at the moment when, having visited the tomb to find it empty and set down her ointment jar, she 'turned herself back and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus'. There is no mistaking her former profession. The majority of the 17th and 18th century works are decorative and commercial, with a substantial group of Roman capricci and Venetian vedute - including a splendid Canaletto of the Colosseum - still-lifes and flowerpieces. The most delightful of the latter is a confection of pale pink roses and orange blossom by the best-known Spanish flower painter, Juan de Arellano. There is a self-portrait bust by Murillo, a half-length portrait of a gentleman by Rembrandt's pupil Govaert Flinck, and another, this time full-length, by Gerard Ter Borch, stylish but understated to the point of over-respectability. It is a relief - albeit briefly - to confront Ter Brugghen's exuberant roistering fiddler, his bottle-nose shining like a red traffic light at night. It is a marvellous picture, but hideous. An unexpected pleasure is a conversation piece by Jan Joseph Horemans the Elder, Antwerp's answer to Zoffany. Its neighbour, filling an entire gallery wall, is more interesting still. This Good Samaritan is by the little-known and short-lived Giovanni Battista Langetti, who was born and trained in Genoa and went to Rome before ending up in Venice. His style is best described as a sort of Ribera-Giordano inspired Caravaggism. Once again, the gallery has found a quota of the impressive and the unexpected for a show that, extending also to the German, French and British schools, reflects the firm's unusual breadth of interest. Old Master drawings rather than paintings are the subject of a loan exhibition at Christie's (8 King Street, SW1, until May 14). The collection was formed by Thomas Man Bridge, who travelled on the Continent in the 1830s, and bequeathed to Folkestone Library and Museum in 1924. This is the first time that it has been on public display, and Christie's is its first venue on a national tour that also takes in Dunkerque. It is a curiously disjointed and uneven collection but it boasts a handful of stunning sheets. An exquisite and richly washed drawing by Raphael's pupil Perino del Vaga, The Reception of Psyche, is the most elaborate. What a pity that its verso, represented by a photograph, could not have been shown too. A Guercino study of a boy resting his head in his cupped hand is a tour-de-force of draughtsmanship and observation, executed in that most appealing of media, red chalk. Jusepe de Ribera employs it too, for a careful and precisely outlined drawing of the Risen Christ. Bridge seems to have had a predilection for the School of Bologna, and for 18th and 19th century British watercolours and drawings. Spare a moment for John Brown's sheet of studies of heads of monks, variously scowling under their ample cowls.</p>

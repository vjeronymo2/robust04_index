			<p><P> September 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RACIAL TENSION HAUNTS A 'NICE NEIGHBORHOOD'  </P> <P> It is a neighborhood of small shops, corner delis and tidy houses and apartment  buildings with statues of saints adorning front-yard gardens.  </P> <P> On summer evenings, families lounge in aluminum lawn chairs and chat merrily  with their neighbors, many speaking in their native Italian, as kids play  freely in the quiet streets.  </P> <P> But this is also where a gang of white teen-agers, armed with baseball bats and  at least one gun, shot to death a black youth who had come to the neighborhood  with three companions to see about buying a used car, heightening racial  tensions here to their worst level in two years.  </P> <P> Like many ethnic enclaves in northern cities, Bensonhurst, a largely  Italian-American community of 152,700 residents on Brooklyn's southern shore,  has rarely, if ever, been noted for being hospitable to "outsiders" --  especially blacks and other minorities.  </P> <P> Two decades ago, as the nation sifted the ashes of successive urban riots,  academics and many government officials hoped that education and greater  integration would break down intolerance in such communities. Instead, the  situation may have worsened.  </P> <P> In New York City , for example, there has been an alarming string of violent  racial incidents in working class, white ethnic neighborhoods in recent years,  including the widely publicized death in 1986 of a black man who was hit by a  car while fleeing a gang of whites in the Howard Beach section of Queens and  the brutal killing in 1982 of a black man by whites in the Gravesend  neighborhood of Brooklyn, near Bensonhurst.  </P> <P> On the eve of a protest march today through Bensonhurst to be led by black  activists, attitudes are hard.  </P> <P> "The violence to which blacks have been subjected in New York City surpasses  the violence of the Southern cities of my youth," Herbert Daughtry, pastor of  Brooklyn's House of the Lord Pentecostal Church, said in a recent opinion piece  published in the New York Times.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Nice Neighborhood'  </P> <P> In Bensonhurst, one 59-year-old resident said Wednesday: "It's a nice  neighborhood -- just like any other place in the United States -- but we don't  care for black people."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, residents almost universally reject suggestions by outsiders that  racism is a problem in the community.  </P> <P> Many argue that last week's slaying of 16-year-old Yusuf Hawkins was a case of  jealously and mistaken identity more than racism. According to various  accounts, the gang of young whites thought Hawkins and his companions were  friends of a white Bensonhurst girl whose spurned lover had warned her not to  invite blacks and Latinos into the neighborhood.  </P> <P> "This kind of thing never happens," said Frank Adamo, 32, a newsstand owner,  referring to the killing. "This is a neighborhood where whites get along with  blacks. We all get along."  </P> <P> Yet, just two years ago on Christmas Day, two blacks were beaten by a gang of  whites in Bensonhurst who allegedly yelled: "This is our Howard Beach!" And in  1983, whites assaulted three black men on their way home through the  neighborhood to their jobs at a Coney Island hospital. None of the injuries in  either incident was fatal.  </P> <P> What is more, when a group of largely black protesters staged a demonstration  last weekend at the site where Hawkins was slain, several white  counterdemonstrators held up watermelons and shouted an epithet.  </P> <P> "They shout (the epithet) and then tell everybody they're not racist," said  Richard Wade, a professor of urban history at City University of New York's  Graduate Center. "They don't even know they're racist. That's the trouble. They  don't know what racism is."  </P> <P> Bensonhurst's latest black victim has even been blamed for precipitating the  crime. As one young white put it, referring to Hawkins: "Look, he was black.  What was he doing in a white neighborhood at 9:30 at night?"  </P> <P> The Rev. Charles Fermiglia, the 30-year-old associate pastor of St. Dominic's  Roman Catholic Church in Bensonhurst, said that racial attitudes in the  community are strongly conditioned by the constant barrage of negative  portrayals of blacks in the mass media -- newspapers, radio, television and  movies -- and the relative scarcity of any countervailing images.  </P> <P> Nearly half of Bensonhurst's Italian-American population is made up of  immigrants from Italy, many from the strongly traditional regions of southern  Italy and Sicily.  </P> <P> "The Italian-American transplanted to this community wants to live in a  neighborhood with familiars, people who share his values of family and  community and can give him meaning," Fermiglia said. "The perceptions of blacks  gained through the media, unfortunately, is that they are socially  disconnected."  </P> <P> General attitudes in society are magnified in places like Bensonhurst, said  Charles Willie, a Harvard University professor of education and urban studies.  </P> <P> "These neighborhoods are acting out the values which they have heard  articulated not just by other working-class people but by middle-class people  and others" on up the socioeconomic ladder, he said. "The people in Bensonhurst  hear the more affluent white opinion-molders talk against the encroachment . .  . that blacks and Hispanics are making, and they feel they are doing the right  thing."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Less Recourse  </P> <P> If their actions more often take a violent turn than those by whites in more  affluent settings -- such as the suburban communities or college campuses that  also have experienced a rash of racial incidents in recent years -- it usually  is because blue-collar whites feel that they have less recourse to  institutional systems to protect their interests, Willie said.  </P> <P> The Northeast's sharp decline in manufacturing jobs -- the traditional  occupational mainstay of urban, white ethnic communities -- together with the  ever increasing proportions of blacks, Latinos and Asians in city populations,  has given many of these neighborhoods the feeling, rightly or wrongly, that  their backs are against the wall, Wade said.  </P> <P> "In the simplest terms, what happens in a place like Bensonhurst is the people  who can make it, leave, while those who can't, stay behind," he said. "Those  involved in these racial incidents are people with marginal jobs or no jobs at  all, who haven't finished high school and only occasionally go to college.  </P> <P> "You have these pockets all over where you have left behind a class of whites  who may have already moved two or three times as a result of the expanding  ghetto. And now, there's no place to go. As one person in Bensonhurst was  quoted as saying in the paper: 'They keep pushing so, there's no place to go  but the water.' "  </P> <P> The association of blacks with high crime rates is another obstacle to greater  acceptance and tolerance, Fermiglia, the priest, said.  </P> <P> Bensonhurst has one of the lowest crime rates in Brooklyn. For example, only 13  murders and 15 forcible rapes were reported in the community in 1988. That  compares to 64 murders and 117 rapes in the predominantly black Brownsville  neighborhood, which has a population half that of Bensonhurst, and 128 murders  and 253 rapes in the largely black Bedford-Stuyvesant community, which has a  population of 133,800 -- 18,900 less than Bensonhurst's.  </P> <P> Fermiglia acknowledged that Bensonhurst's residents look merely at such  statistics and do not take into account the much greater unemployment and other  economic and social factors that may be behind the higher crime rates in the  black sections.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Old South  </P> <P> He also decries comparisons of Bensonhurst with the South of the Jim Crow era,  saying that unlike Dixie during that period, the public officials and civic and  religious leaders of the Brooklyn community do not condone or publicly support  racism and segregation.  </P> <P> In recent years, Bensonhurst has become home to a small but growing number of  Asians and Latinos -- chiefly Puerto Ricans -- who appear to be relatively well  accepted in the community.  </P> <P> "I've lived here for two years and I haven't encountered any prejudice. Well,  just a little bit," said Hae Soo Jeon, proprietor of Yang's Grocery-Deli on one  of Bensonhurst's bustling commercial strips. "I didn't even know this was  Bensonhurst until the murder happened. I thought I was in a place called Bay  Ridge."  </P> <P> A smattering of blacks are said to live in Bensonhurst as well, and many blacks  work in the local shops and businesses, although usually in menial jobs, and at  the local post office.  </P> <P> Although some of the blacks who work here say they have had their share of bad  encounters and don't hang around the neighborhood after work, others say their  experiences have been virtually problem-free.  </P> <P> "I've worked here for two years and never had any trouble," said Trevor Fuller,  32, who lives in Flatbush and is a delivery man for a monthly Bensonhurst  newspaper. "I don't hang around after work, but if I did, they wouldn't bother  me. Everybody knows (me). Besides, my brother-in-law is Italian."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, as a white political worker familiar with New York's blue-collar,  white ethnic enclaves says: "Brooklyn and Queens are extremely racist, no  matter what anybody tells you. I think it comes from the fact that the majority  of whites grow up in segregated neighborhoods, go to parochial schools and have  no exposure to minority people of any color, and there's just an incredible  fear of them. In a large part, it's a fear of the unknown, which seems kind of  crazy in 1989."  </P> <P> How to overcome these fears and create greater racial tolerance and harmony in  communities like Bensonhurst remains a big question.  </P> <P> "In some ways, the working class and the poor are paying the price of the  unwillingness of the society to solve the economic and social problems" that  help feed racial hatreds and animosities, said Richard Simpson, a former  Chicago alderman who is now a political science professor at the University of  Illinois at Chicago.  </P> <P> Simpson said that the North Side Chicago ward that he once represented boasted  a multiethnic and multiracial population that managed to live without the  strife normally associated with such neighborhoods because "most people were  moving up in society and weren't threatened by sliding down."  </P> <P> What is more, "we weren't threatened by a Cabrini-Green next door," he said,  referring to a deteriorating, crime-ridden Chicago high-rise public housing  project near the downtown Loop business district.  </P> <P> "We could even introduce three public housing projects of our own without only  a little flak," he said. "They were the low-rise kind with only 18 units in  each of the three buildings, but if you tried that on the northwest or  southwest sides, there would be some serious threats or even firebombs."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Stance by Leaders  </P> <P> Simpson also contends that a lot could be achieved if public officials and  community leaders took an open stance against racism and encouraged programs  and policies that promoted greater racial understanding and tolerance.  </P> <P> In Bensonhurst, tentative steps have already been made in that direction. The  Brooklyn Borough President, Howard Golden, and the superintendent of Community  School District 20 in Bensonhurst, promised at a recent news conference to  expand the human relations curriculum in the district classrooms.  </P> <P> How much further this kind of activity will go and whether it will help create  a better racial climate remains to be seen. But as Elizabeth Galarza, the  32-year-old Bensonhurst mother of four who held the dying Yusuf Hawkins' hand  after he was shot and murmured words of encouragement to him, said: "There are  more of us who believe in a positive way and that's the way we should all go in  this neighborhood."  </P> <P> Intern Silke Fett contributed to this report.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] In 1994, Russia is planning to promote and export  its military equipment, a high-ranking Russian military  official, who preferred to remain anonymous, told INTERFAX. He  said that this year, Russian military delegations would  participate in about 18 international exhibitions of military  equipment and know-how.    The biggest display of Russian weapons is to be seen at the  ILA-94 aerospace exhibition in Berlin (May and June), during the  air show in Cannes (June) commemorating the landing of allied  troops in Normandy, and during the Farnborough air show in  Britain.    To quote this military official, Russia will demonstrate its  AN-124 and IL-76M cargo planes, the IL-96M passenger liner,  MIG-29, SU-27 and SU-30 fighters, the KA-50 combat helicopter  and KA-28 anti-boat helicopter. It will also demonstrate its  latest air-defense facilities, including the Buk-M1  anti-aircraft complex, Tor-M1 anti-aircraft missile station,  Tunguska M anti-aircraft missile complex and Igla portable  antiaircraft complex.</p>

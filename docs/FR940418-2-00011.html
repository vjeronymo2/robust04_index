			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Equity Infusions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The GOI, through IRI, provided new equity capital to Terni, TAS, or ILVA in every year from 1978 through 1991, except in 1979, 1983, 1989, and 1990. Respondents have not provided any argument refuting our preliminary determination that the GOI's equity investments were provided specifically to the steel industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed above, we have determined that Terni, TAS, and ILVA were unequityworthy in each year that they received new equity capital. Therefore, these provisions of equity were inconsistent with commercial considerations and are countervailable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To calculate the benefit for the POI, we treated each of the equity amounts as a grant and allocated the benefits over a 15-year period. (Our treatment of equity as grants and our choice of allocation period is discussed in the GIA, at 37239 and 37225, respectively.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the preliminary determination, we treated a capital increase received by ILVA in the amount of 205,097 million lire in 1990 as a countervailable equity infusion because ILVA reported it as an equity infusion in its responses. At verification, we established that the amount reported as an equity infusion was, in fact, due to the transfer of residual assets from Italsider, TAS, and Finsider, which were all in liquidation. As explained in connection with the 1988&hyph;1990 restructuring, we do not consider the transfer of assets in connection with a restructuring to be an ``equity infusion'' since the transfer merely redistributes existing assets. Therefore, we have excluded the amount of this capital contribution from our calculations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the equity infusions provided to Terni and TAS, we have divided the benefit allocated to the POI by the sales of the Specialty Steels Division of ILVA. We chose this sales denominator because this division most closely resembles the former companies, Terni and TAS. For equity infusions into ILVA, we used ILVA's sales as our denominator, as benefits from these investments are not tied to any division of ILVA. On this basis, we find the estimated net subsidy to be 9.71 percent  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ad valorem  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> for all manufacturers, producers, and exporters in Italy of the subject merchandise.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. The Transfer of Lovere and Trieste to Terni in 1982  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed in the ``Corporate History'' section of this notice, Lovere and Trieste were transferred from Italsider to Terni as part of a 1982 restructuring.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We have determined that this transaction is correctly characterized as an internal corporate restructuring. No new equity capital was provided to Terni through the transfer of these assets. However, just as subsidies given to Terni and TAS continued to bestow a benefit on ILVA when ILVA received TAS' assets, subsidies received by Italsider flowed to Terni when Terni received Lovere and Trieste.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We determined the amount of Italsider's subsidies attributable to Lovere and Trieste by calculating the percentage of assets these two companies represented of the total Italsider assets. We applied this percentage to the ``untied'' subsidies received by Italsider to calculate the portion of the benefit that flowed to Terni when it received Lovere and Trieste.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The benefit allocated to the POI was divided by the total sales of the Specialty Steels Division of ILVA. On this basis, we find the estimated net subsidy to be 0.41 percent  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ad valorem  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> for all manufacturers, producers, and exporters in Italy of the subject merchandise.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Law 675/77 Preferential Financing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Law 675/77 was designed to bring industrial assistance measures from the GOI under a single system. The program had at its core three main objectives: (1) the reorganization and development of the industrial sector as a whole; (2) the increase of employment in the South; and (3) the promotion of employment in depressed areas. To achieve these goals, Law 675/77 provided six types of benefits: (1) grants to pay interest on bank loans; (2) mortgage loans provided by the Ministry of Industry (``MOI'') at subsidized interest rates; (3) other grants to pay interest on loans financed by IRI bond issues; (4) capital grants for the South; (5) VAT reductions on capital good purchases for companies in the South; and (6) personnel retraining grants. (The fourth, fifth, and sixth components of Law 675/77 are discussed below.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

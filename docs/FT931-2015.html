			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Survey of Information and Communications Technology (5): The shape of things to come? COMPUTERS are progressing to the point that they can accept a user's wish as their command, writes Peggy Salz-Trautman. Scientists at several research laboratories in the US, Japan and Austria have moved beyond the keyboard, the mouse and the joystick, and progressed to experimenting with so-called 'mind-over-cursor' technology - a by-product of the bio-cybernetics program began by the US Defense Department in the late 1970s - which enables specially trained individuals to use a computer without uttering a sound or moving a muscle. It is claimed that interaction between a brain and a computer is possible thanks to the advance of electro-encephalography, or EEC, the technique of attaching electrodes to the scalp. Signals collected by EEC, signals which are emitted by the brain as it works, can now be passed on to computers whose job it is to analyse them. In practice, a person fitted with a slew of cables and a helmet which could easily belong to either an officer of Star Fleet Command or a member of the local swim team, focuses his total concentration on a series of letters or a particular command - and the computer obeys the order. According to a recent report in The New York Times, University of Illinois psychologists have developed a way of allowing people to type, albeit at a rate of only 2.3 characters a minute, by spelling out words in their minds. Researchers at Fujitsu, Japan's largest personal computer manufacturer, take this a step further. They are developing super-sensitive brain-wave detectors, or Squids (which stands for 'superconducting quantum interference device') to interface between the silent speech of the brain and the program language of a computer. For Prof. Kevin Warwick, expert on cybernetics at Britain's Reading University, one-to-one interaction between a brain and a computer is 'not science fiction and not yet science fact.'

Police have also confiscated radio equipment from the  aircraft, saying there are no valid transportation permits for  the equipment. The grounding was authorised by the district  commissioner of Namibia's north-eastern region, Mr Ben Haingura,  after a request from Angolan authorities.    The Antonov-26's pilot, Mr Oleg Pantiuhia, denied the claims  of supplying UNITA and said his employer, Ecomex, supplied  medical equipment to "Angolan civilians".</p>

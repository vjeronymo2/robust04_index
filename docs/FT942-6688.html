			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Markets: Camelot offers refuge from bears - London Camelot here we come] At 14m to one, the odds on winning the jackpot in the new national lottery seem a lot shorter than making money in the currently miserable stock market. Only two things are required of us by the Camelot consortium awarded the lottery license this week: pay it Pounds 1 and arrange six numbers in the same order it picks. Six numbers only the glummest bears were betting to see this year were 2,800.00 on the FT-SE 100 index. But by the close of play yesterday, after the index had fallen below 3,000 for the first time in eight months, the odds on the index hitting that number had shortened considerably. The 160.9 point, 5 per cent, drop in the Footsie this week was caused by the same factors which have remorselessly driven equities back from their January peak: good news on economic growth and slightly poor news on inflation combined to wreak havoc in bond markets at home and abroad. The rot started in Helsinki on Monday when Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president, indicated that German interest rates might not fall further in the short-term. By the time the Germans had aborted a government bond auction and released another remarkably strong figure for money supply growth on Wednesday, European bond markets were convinced interest rates had nowhere to go but up. Equities, still fatally attracted to the fall and rise of interest rates, had nowhere to go but down. Is it right equities should drop back to where they were eight months ago? After all, the UK's economic recovery is firmly established with, for example, factory orders in May at their highest level in five years. The corporate results season has been even better than forecast with dividends rising 7 per cent on average. For most analysts the answer is a resounding 'no'. The sell off 'is quite ridiculous,' says Paul Walton, equity strategist at James Capel. He lays full blame at the feet of futures traders. Yesterday, for example, he says they took very bearish positions in bond futures after the latest US data was released. But their positions exaggerated the threat the data posed to US interest rates, let alone European ones. Wall Street took the news better than London. The traders aggressively sold stock futures to profitably exploit equities' slavish attachment to bonds. This forced market makers to slash stock prices rather than risk exposure over a long weekend. However, the light share trading at these lowered prices, indicated that investors are disinclined to stampede for the exits. 'The markets should not be down at these levels but the negative sentiment is still there,' says Ian Harnett, strategist at Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull. He concedes that 'there are some fundamentals to hang the weakness on' such as the high real yield on index linked gilts. But down at, say, 2,800 on the Footsie, equities offer indisputable value: a dividend yield of 4.5 per cent and a prospective price/earnings ratio of about 12.5. 'We've not seen values like this since the depths of the recession.' He says two conditions are needed to reverse the equity market's slide: a correction in over-sold bond markets; and a change in investors' focus from interest rates to earnings. 'Even if interest rates are heading upwards, this is for a healthy reason: the economy is growing and so are corporate profits and dividends.' Analysts at SG Warburg Securities concur. Rising interest rates have 'not necessarily been a bear signal for equities,' they note. For example, two recent periods of strong growth and climbing rates, 1984-85 and 1988-89, saw equities rise 17 per cent. 'The recovery which prompted the upward pressure on rates also prompted growth in earnings.' Warburgs is less sanguine than Strauss Turnbull about equities' ability to assert their attractiveness. 'The valuation arithmetic is sufficiently stretched to suggest little hope of equities de-coupling from bond market trends this summer.' The greatest havoc falling share prices created this week was in the new issues market. A number of high profile companies pulled their flotations rather than cut offering prices to encourage investors. Tele West and General Cable in cable television, London Capital Holdings in property and Murray Johnstone's smaller companies fund in investment trusts were prime examples. One float which was priced was London Clubs International, the casino operator. The news was less cheerful at Ladbroke. Its warning of a downturn in its credit betting business knocked its shares. The biggest poker game in town, the Eurotunnel rights issue, has so far paid handsomely for the houses organising it. A group of advisers led by SG Warburg Securities, Morgan Grenfell and Banque Suez will earn Pounds 42m for pulling off the Pounds 858.3m rights issue. Eurotunnel says the Pounds 1.5bn it has raised in the past week has ensured its viability. There is little room for manoeuvre, though, within the tight traffic forecasts. Shareholders who take up the rights will have to wait into the next millennium for dividends. A string of results from large companies underscored the strength of the corporate recovery: British Airways' pre-tax profits for the year to March were up 63 per cent to Pounds 300m and Marks and Spencer's profits rose 16 per cent to Pounds 851.5m. But investors wanting a surer punt on future earnings need look no further than the Camelot consortium. Smith New Court forecasts that membership of the grouping will enhance the earnings of Cadbury-Schweppes by 3 per cent, of De La Rue by 9 per cent and Racal by 22 per cent. And all that on only a 0.6 per cent profit margin, such is the sheer volume of money the British public is expected to gamble on six numbers.</p>

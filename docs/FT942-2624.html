			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / KPMG 'not told of Walker links' An accountant asked by Brent Walker to review transactions criticised in the press never learnt of close links between the property and leisure group and the other companies involved, an Old Bailey jury heard yesterday. Mr Philip Hardacre of KPMG Peat Marwick was called to help Brent Walker answer criticisms of the arms-length nature of sales of film rights by Brent Walker's film division to Universal Talent Management. The prosecution in the trial of Mr George Walker, the former Brent Walker chairman and chief executive, alleges the transactions were part of a fraud to boost Brent Walker's profits by Pounds 19m. Mr Walker and Mr Wilfred Aquilina, a former Brent Walker finance director, both deny charges of theft, false accounting and conspiracy. Mr John Quested and Mr Donald Anderson, both former directors of the Brent Walker film division, are alleged to have been co-conspirators. Giving evidence, Mr Hardacre said he discussed the transactions with the four men, but did not become aware that UTM's bank account was controlled by Mr Quested and Mr Anderson. Nor did he know that some of the money paid by UTM would be refunded by Brent Walker itself. The trial continues on Monday.</p>

			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Arts: Eden in downtown Paris - Alice Rawsthorn leaves her shoes behind and loses herself inher imagination in an urban adult playpen THERE ARE few things that are quite so soothing as walking barefoot over fine, silver sand on a steamy summer day. But you usually expect to find the sand on a seaside beach, not in an art gallery in the bustling streets of central Paris. One of the ground floor galleries at the Jeu de Paume in the Tuileries Gardens has been turned into a giant sandpit for the summer. The sandpit, otherwise known as Eden, is a replica of an installation created in 1969 by Helio Oiticica, the Brazilian artist. Oiticica saw Eden as a place where people would be tempted away from reality to lose themselves in their imagination. He built it as an adult playpen with brightly coloured tents and tepees pitched on the sand. There is even a wooden shelf where gallery goers can leave their shoes to walk inside. It is a masterstroke. The tactile experience of walking on the sand is such a shock to the senses that it makes you forget you are in an inner-urban art gallery and whisks you into Oiticica's world. Oiticica was one of the leading lights in the Brazilian avant garde until his death, at the age of 43, in 1980. He was one of a group of artists working in Rio de Janiero during the 1960s and 1970s who were trying to define a Brazilian form of modernism. He was influenced by European artists, Mondrian and Malevitch in painting, and Godard in video and installation. But he also experimented with Brazilian themes, the collective ritual of feasting and the visual rhetoric of kitsch, which he parodied in his Tropicalia installations of caged parrots and gaudy carnival costumes. At times the show verges on a hippy nostalgia trip back to groovy Rio good life, with Stockhausen and the Rolling Stones blaring out of the sound system. There is even a reconstruction of Cosmacoca, an installation where you lie on mattresses to watch slide projections of Luis Bunuel, the Spanish film maker, his face latticed with cocaine lines, to the strains of Jimi Hendrix. The overwhelming impression is Oiticica's sense of fun. The sounds, the sandpit and carnival costumes, all evoke the theatricality of Rio street life. Even his formal work, the Spatial Relief mobiles and minimalist paintings, turn the gallery into a blaze of his favourite colours of white, yellow, orange and red - so much so that it comes as a surprise when you glance out of the Jeu de Paume windows to see the splendour of Paris, the Place de la Concorde and the Tuileries Gardens. * * * Michel Verjux, like Helio Oiticica, is obsessed with trying to find a new artistic language for his era. There the similarity ends. The contrast between the gaudy gaiety of the Oiticica show at the Jeu de Paume and the cool restraint of Verjux's exhibition at the Musee de l'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris could not be greater. Verjux, a French artist in his early 40s, sees art as a means of communication and a forum for exploring the ideas of the linguistic theorists, Ferdinand de Saussure and Karl Budieresisher, who are so influential in contemporary French thought. His chosen medium is electric light. Verjux chose it partly because he sees it as a pure, irreducible form and partly because of the linguistic associations between l'illumination, the French word for light, and the power of art in communication and as a force for enlightenment. He has taken over the whole top floor of the MAM for Au Milieu, his latest installation. It consists of 16 projectors throwing perfect circular pools of light onto the white walls. The circles are eerily beautiful. Their similarity in shape and size prompts you to peer closely at the colour contrasts in the white and at the blue rims around the edge. Verjux's electric circles are also peculiarly appropriate to MAM itself. Electricity is a common theme in the work of the early 20th century artists in the MAM permanent collection, such as Robert Delaunay and Raoul Dufy, both of whom saw electric power as a force for progress. The circles also complement the Art Deco curves and geometrics of MAM's architecture and accentuate its nautical feel by evoking the portholes of 1930s luxury liners. It is brave of a publicly funded arts institution to give over an entire floor to a single installation. But MAM, under Suzanne Page's directorship, has established itself as one of Paris's most imaginative museums. Au Milieu is at its best when the gallery is quiet. Go early in the morning before the crowds arrive. * * * Another publicly funded Paris arts institution is under scrutiny at L'Institut de l'Architecture. It is exhibiting the work of Dominique Perrault, the 39-year-old French architect who has been clouded by controversy over the giant glass towers he has designed for the new national French library, the Tres Grand Bibiliotheque. Perrault, like most of the new generation of French architects reared on an era of publicly sponsored competitions, has designed many more buildings than he has built. The exhibition offers a timely opportunity to trace the development of his ideas from his first building, the Someloir factory at Chateaudun, to the library itself. Helio Oiticica at the Jeu de Paume, Place de la Concorde until August 23. (Closed Monday) Michel Verjux at Musee de l'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, 11 Avenue du President Wilson until October 4. (Closed Monday) Dominique Perrault at L'Institut de l'Architecture, 6 bis rue de Tournon, until September 27. (Closed Monday and Tuesday).</p>

They had been left in a van  while the two officers who transferred them checked their weapons.  </P> <P> The escapees were identified as Tony McGee, 21, and Jake G. Encinas, 19, both  of San Diego. McGee was serving a sentence for robbery and Encinas had been  sentenced for auto theft.  </P> <P> When the correctional officers returned to the van, the two men overpowered  them and fled on foot. One resident near the facility found two jail uniforms  on his living room floor.

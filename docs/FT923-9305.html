			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Letter: Money made available to meter but not to manage Sir, So Mr Michael Howard says that up to Pounds 3bn is estimated to be the cost of installing water meters in England and Wales ('Compulsory metering of water backed by minister for first time', July 31). Amazing the government can find such an amount to spend on installing water meters but cannot find any money to improve the way in which water is managed. I note that he says the cost would ultimately have to be borne by the consumer and that the impact of metering 'on poor families clearly needs attention'. Presumably, by his latter statement, Mr Howard has the poor homeowner firmly fixed in his mind. Bo Henderson, 30 Chatham Hill, Chatham, Kent ME4 4JE</p>

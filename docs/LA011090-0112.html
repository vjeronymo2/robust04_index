			<p><P> January 10, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRAND NAMES PUT TO TEST IN SURVEY;  </P> <P> CONSUMERS: MERCEDES-BENZ, KODAK COME OUT ON TOP IN A REPORT THAT ATTEMPTS TO  COMPARE PERCEPTIONS OF VARIOUS PRODUCTS.  </P> <P> A survey of items as diverse as candy bars and health insurance found that  consumers think Mercedes-Benz automobiles and Kodak film are tops in quality  but that Continental Airlines and the rock music video channel MTV rank near  the bottom.  </P> <P> Coke and Pepsi are dead even in terms of perceived quality, but the Pepsi  generation seems more satisfied with its cola. And while Toyota owners are  among the most loyal of any brand-name devotees, the average American says  Buick offers more quality.  </P> <P> The survey, results of which were released Tuesday, is one of only a few that  have attempted to compare consumers' impressions of brand-name products in  different market categories.  </P> <P> According to the study, done by Total Research Corp., Levi's jeans were  perceived to be a higher-quality product than Maxwell House coffee, and  Michelin tires had a much better image than Aqua-Fresh toothpaste.  </P> <P> John Morton, who developed the idea for the research, said the broad  perspective demonstrates that even products that are strong within their field  sometimes need an image boost.  </P> <P> "You get lost in your own product category and you may think you're doing  pretty well when actually you're very vulnerable," said Morton, senior vice  president of Total Research.  </P> <P> Examples of vulnerable brands, he said, are Kellogg's Corn Flakes, Holiday Inn  and Lipton Soup. All ranked relatively high on an awareness scale but ranked  lower in terms of consumers' perceptions of quality. More importantly, regular  consumers of these brands gave them relatively weak ratings.  </P> <P> One of the more surprising results of the survey was the relatively low-quality  ratings given by consumers to all fast-food restaurants. Despite its dominant  position in the field, McDonald's fared no better than Burger King or Wendy's,  the other two chains included in the survey.  </P> <P> "My feeling about the fast-food restaurants is that their primary advantage to  the public is price, convenience, speed and so forth," Morton said. "Nobody has  really tried to establish quality in that field."  </P> <P> Other poor performers included cold remedies and airlines in general, although  Continental Airlines stood near the bottom of every ranking.  </P> <P> The airline, a unit of Texas Air Inc., ranked 89th out of 91 brands in terms of  quality and 90th in terms of awareness. In a ranking of quality as perceived by  regular customers, the airline ranked last.  </P> <P> The survey also held some surprises among automobile brands, with Buick ranking  well above Ford and Dodge, particularly among consumers who owned the various  brands.  </P> <P> MTV, which ranked at the very bottom of the list of consumers' perceptions of  quality, was also considered the most controversial brand on the telephone  survey of 1,000 households.  </P> <P> Among loyal viewers, however, the music-video cable channel fared relatively  well, indicating that MTV performs well among a limited market segment.  </P> <P> The brands included in the survey, representing 33 product and service  categories, were selected in an attempt to represent what Morton called "the  entire consumer experience."  </P> <P> From the results of the survey, the Princeton, N.J.-based research company  determined that consumers can be classified in one of seven categories that can  help predict their behavior.  </P> <P> The company said consumers tend to determine quality on the basis of whether  products are sophisticated, practical, sentimental, project an image of energy,  provide relief or escape, help in the struggle for popularity or reflect a "new  traditionalism."  </P> <P> Morton said Total Research hopes to sell the survey data to corporations  included in the research or to their rivals. Subscriptions will cost $35,000 or  $60,000, depending on how much information the subscriber wants.  </P> <P> THE BEST AND THE WORST  </P> <P> According to a survey of consumer attitudes toward 91 brand names conducted by  Total Research Corp. in Princeton, N.J., the following products ranked in terms  of perceived quality. The products were rated on a theoretical scale of 0 to  100, with 100 representing a perfect product. The results were based on  telephone interviews with respondents in 1,000 households nationwide in  November and December.  </P> <P> ON THE TOP  </P> <P> 1. Mercedes-Benz automobiles 84  </P> <P> 2.

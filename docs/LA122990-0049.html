			<p><P> December 29, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GIRLS' ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> LAKEWOOD'S INSIDE GAME STOPS HUNTINGTON BEACH  </P> <P> The Lakewood High School girls' basketball team deployed its potent inside  offense repeatedly to beat Huntington Beach, 67-59, Friday night in the  semifinals of the Marina Tournament.  </P> <P> The Lancers (12-1) scored 24 points on layups or short shots, most of them by  6-foot-3 Melissa Gower (27 points) and 6-1 Charon Johnson (21 points).  </P> <P> Gower, who had 14 points in the first half, shot 60% from the field (12 of 20).  </P> <P> "They're tough to handle," said Huntington Beach Coach Nick Bartlett about the  powerful Lakewood tandem.  </P> <P> Huntington Beach (9-4) managed to stay within 34-30 at the half by converting  10 of 14 free throws while commiting only one team foul and limiting Lakewood  to a pair of points from the line in the half.  </P> <P> But Lakewood went on a 10-0 run midway through the third quarter and held a  54-40 edge at the end of the period.  </P> <P> The Oilers, the ninth-ranked team in Orange County, pulled to within nine  points on a layup by center Jen Johnson with 5 minutes 26 seconds left to play,  but couldn't narrow the margin. Guard Jana Davis led Huntington Beach with 20  points. Johnson scored 15 and sophomore forward Clare Walker had 13. Johnson  also grabbed 18 rebounds.  </P> <P> Huntington Beach didn't help its cause by shooting 32% from the field. The  Oilers hit five of 16 shots from the field for their only points of the third  quarter, a period during which Lakewood scored 20 points. FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ  </P></p>

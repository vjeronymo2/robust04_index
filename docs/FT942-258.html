			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / European military aviation setbacks Cross-border co-operation in defence aviation suffered a twin setback yesterday, with Germany going slow on the Eurofighter aircraft and the UK reaffirming its unwillingness to fund a new European military transporter. A meeting of the German parliament's budget committee, the last before the summer recess, failed to approve the extra funds that were viewed as necessary to complete development work on the Eurofighter on schedule. The committee did make a small award of about DM200m (Pounds 80.6m) to ensure that work on the project will continue in the coming months, but it did not earmark the funds needed to keep the project on schedule until the end of the decade. The main reason for the delay is a dispute between the German Defence Ministry and Deutsche Aerospace, the German industrial partner, on how the extra development costs should be split between government and industry. With German elections due in October, Germany's partners in the Eurofighter consortium - Britain, Italy and Spain - were understood to be resigning themselves to some delay in the project. The four governments had until recently hoped to sign a memorandum of understanding this summer on completing the Pounds 30bn project. In London, the Defence Ministry confirmed that it saw no reason to allocate public money to the development of the Future Large Aircraft, a project to meet Europe's strategic airlift needs which France and Germany are strongly backing. Britain is studying two options - the C130J made by Lockheed of the US and the proposed FLA - as it considers ways to replenish its ageing fleet of Hercules military transporters. British Aerospace is urging the government to play a part in developing the FLA, arguing that that it could bring Pounds 12bn worth of work to the UK and create 7,500 jobs. Yesterday's statement upheld the view London has taken since 1989, which is that there are no grounds for putting UK government money towards the FLA. It said the government would keep open the option of buying some FLA 'off the shelf'. Defence industry experts believe it might be possible for the UK private sector to come up with development funds - and therefore stake a claim to a share of the aircraft's production - if the government commits itself to buying some of the new transporters.</p>

			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / A tough act to follow: Japanese business is hoping for monetary relaxation under a new central bank governor In a deserted Tokyo, at midnight, a huddle of people gathered last week for an out-of-hours announcement. Mr Yasuo Matsushita, a former bureaucrat and commercial banker, had been selected as Japan's next central bank governor. The late-night timing could hardly have heightened the interest in the appointment: few are the Japanese businessmen and financiers who have not hoped for a softening in monetary policy with the ending of the dramatic tenure of outgoing governor Mr Yasushi Mieno. The current restructuring of the Japanese economy owes much to Mr Mieno's vision, and the slowness of the recovery something to his discipline. He moved to curb the unbridled growth of the 1980s, and has since held to a policy designed to squeeze Japan's corporate sector. Mr Matsushita's task will be to steer the economy through the fallout from this process: refining the balancing after the overhaul. Such an agenda is unlikely to prompt a change of course on the scale witnessed by Mr Mieno, but it may prove as controversial. When Mr Mieno took office five years ago Japan's wild financial party of the late 1980s was at its high point. Financial liberalisation, rapid economic growth and easy money had given birth to a bubble economy. What began as an explosion in land prices, in cramped conditions of tight supply and ballooning demand, had quickly spread to embrace equities, bonds, and even golf-club memberships. By the time of Mr Mieno's accession, land prices had risen fivefold in a little over three years, and the stock market had tripled in four. Appalled by the lack of financial control, Mr Mieno, something of an ascetic said never to have bought a share in his life, acted quickly to burst the bubble. Within three weeks he had cut financial sector liquidity and over the next 15 months he raised the discount rate five times, taking it from 2.5 to 6 per cent by the end of 1990. The recession that followed proved the most serious in Japan since the second world war. Share prices collapsed by more than 50 per cent in four years, and land prices fell by up to 70 per cent. As domestic demand fell, corporate Japan was hit by overcapacity. The rise in the yen, prompted by rising interest rates, the large and rising current account surplus and a slowdown in Japanese overseas investment, led to declining demand in export markets. The underlying inefficiency of much of Japanese industry was exposed. The central bank responded to the recession with increasingly urgent cuts in interest rates, taking the official discount rate to a record low of 1.75 per cent last autumn. In the year since, the first signs of sluggish recovery have emerged, with the economy expected to expand by about 1 per cent this year, accelerating slowly thereafter. But the weakness of the recovery presents the new governor with a challenge as difficult as the one that faced his predecessor: he must find the right mix of monetary policy to meet an exacting set of demands. In addition to the usual need to sustain non-inflationary growth, policy must deal with the continuing financial consequences of the collapse of the bubble - corporate indebtedness and the banking system's bad loans. It must also address the longer-term transformation of the economy into an efficient, deregulated market system. So far under Mr Mieno, the bank's approach has been a surprising one - a gentle tightening of monetary conditions. Since July, overnight call rates have been allowed to drift upwards - from 2 per cent in July to 2.3 per cent last week. 'Since the summer the bank has moved gradually to tighten liquidity, which has pushed up short-term interest rates,' says Mr Richard Werner, chief economist at Jardine Fleming in Tokyo. Many economists are puzzled by the bank's tactics. If the slow upturn had been accompanied by the merest hint of inflation, monetary tightening would have been comprehensible. In fact the opposite has occurred. The recovery is so weak that it has failed to counteract the prevailing deflationary forces at work. Wholesale prices are falling at a rate of 2 per cent a year and consumer prices are stable. So the bank's tightening, though gentle for the moment, seems unnecessary. The risks associated with it also appear to be unbalanced. There is an infinitesimal risk of inflation if policy is relaxed, but a significant risk of renewed economic slowdown if policy is tightened. Confronted with this choice the bank has elected to tighten. Mr Toshio Koyano, economist at DKB Research in Tokyo, says: 'The BoJ's move in the past few months has been premature - restraining monetary growth now carries a risk of endangering the recovery.' Most central bankers have a weakness for what Lord Healey, chancellor in the last British Labour government, called sado-monetarism. But in the Bank of Japan's case, there seems to be a more rational explanation for the strategy, based on Mr Mieno's increasingly bullish view of economic prospects. The bank's official judgment is that the economy is 'in the early stages of recovery', a much less cautious view than one espoused by other public bodies. Believing this, the bank's behaviour has differed in this cycle from its policies in previous cycles. In the last two recessions of the 1980s, interest rates were still allowed to fall even after the output gap - the difference between actual output and potential output - had started to narrow. Interest rates began to ease upwards only when inflationary pressures had clearly returned to the economy. This time, the bank is tying monetary policy to its perception of the performance of the real economy, rather than price levels. It has acted to raise interest rates as soon as the output gap has started to close - even though inflation is falling. The bank 'has placed overwhelming emphasis on the pace of economic recovery  -not inflation - as the key policy determinant,' explains Mr Feldman, chief economist at Salomon Brothers. The reason appears to be that the bank is determined to use monetary policy to promote the restructuring of the economy. The long recession and the rise in the value of the yen have forced companies to begin to reduce the overcapacity produced during the bubble. According to Mr James Vestal, chief economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Tokyo: 'By allowing the economy to work through the excesses of the second half of the 1980s on its own, the bank will ensure that the momentum for deregulation, restructuring and change remains intact.' Mr Matsushita may wish to follow the policy of squeezing the corporate sector. But as former chairman of Sakura, a bank with one of the largest portfolios of bad loans, he will be more aware than most of the significant risk of a crisis in the financial sector. Japanese banks have not moved quickly to rid themselves of the problem loans collected in the bubble years. The leading banks have made provisions of just Y3,000bn out of as much as Y30,000bn. Years of sluggish economic growth, however cathartic for manufacturers, would be difficult for the banks, for which it means weak demand, continuing asset problems and poor profitability. Worse, the present monetary tightening is potentially ruinous for them. Already the upward drift in short-term rates has pushed up banks' funding costs. As interest rates rise, banks' interest costs rise more quickly than their income, because of the structure of their assets and liabilities. That is already putting pressure on margins and will limit further their scope to dispose of bad debts. Financial markets are speculating that Mr Matsushita, with his direct experience of the banking sector, might adopt an easier monetary policy to assist the banks. But more likely, the other, longer part of his experience - as a bureaucrat in the finance ministry - will incline him towards a middle course. Macroeconomic policy is likely to be geared towards restrained growth to maintain the pressure on corporate Japan, while banks will be nursed back to health by micro-management. 'The focus will be on case-by-case problem solving of particular banks' balance sheet problems,' says Mr Jesper Koll, of JP Morgan in Tokyo. 'The governor will act as a hands-on manager of these issues. Interest rate policy will not change for the time being.' The implications of that strategy are far-reaching. Policy will not be dictated by the fear of a banking collapse. Instead, some banks may be allowed to fail if they do not represent a risk to the banking system. Mr Matsushita will need to draw on all the credit that his years in the banking sector have given him if he is to achieve that.</p>

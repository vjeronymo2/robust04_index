			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 22 (KCNA) -- A national seminar on  the chuche idea was held in Helsinki on the occasion of the  birthday of the great leader President Kim Il-song.    Pekka Rantala, chairman of the Finnish National Committee  for  the Study of the Chuche Idea, made a report, followed by  speeches.    They noted that President Kim Il-song authored the chuche  idea during the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle and has  applied it in all fields of the revolution and construction and  built Korea to be a model country of socialism as today.    They said Korea is making a great progress in the revolution  and construction under the banner of socialism, not wavering in  face of the pressure and provocations of the imperialists,  because it is guided by the chuche idea authored by President  Kim Il-song.    The chuche idea now serves as the undisputed guiding idea in  the building of socialism and communism and the most universal  guiding idea from which the world people learn, they added.    A congratulatory message to President Kim Il-song was  adopted  at the seminar.    DPRK book, photo and handicraft exhibitions and film shows  for April 15 took place in Montevideo, Uruguay, Almada City,  Setubal Province, Portugal, and Islamabad, Pakistan, and at the  Madagascan metropolitan special police headquarters, the Lagos  Liaison Office of the General Film Bureau of Nigeria and the sky  line company of Thailand.</p>

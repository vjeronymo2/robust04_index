			<p><P> October 24, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> ROCKETS' STAR MAY MISS OPENER  </P> <P> Rockets center Akeem Olajuwon may not be ready to play at full speed in the  regular season opener Nov. 3, Rockets Coach Don Chaney says.  </P> <P> Olajuwon has been restricted to conditioning drills because of a blood clot in  his leg. He cannot participate in contact drills until he stops taking blood  thinners.  </P> <P> "If he comes back two days before the season opener, I'm going to treat him as  an injured player who's coming back," Chaney said Monday. "If they take him off  the medication the night before we play, I might not start him.  </P> <P> "It would be unfair to put him out there 30 or 40 minutes in the first few  games if he hasn't been able to practice fully for a week before the season  starts."  </P> <P> Olajuwon was hospitalized for a week in July when the blood clot was discovered  in his left calf. Doctors say his recovery is progressing on schedule. "We plan  to take him off medication next week," Dr. David Rothschild said.  </P></p>

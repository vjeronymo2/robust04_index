			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Strike shuts Companies House head office THE NATIONAL headquarters of Companies House, the government's company information agency based in Cardiff, was closed yesterday by a one-day strike by several hundred employees. The action followed an announcement last month by Mr David Durham, chief executive, that the agency would reduce its 1,150-strong workforce by between 70 and 80 this year in an effort to save Pounds 3m. Mr Kieron Hill, officer for Wales of the NUCPS Civil Service union, said about 150 staff picketed the agency. 'We don't want to destroy Companies House but we took this action to show our lack of confidence in the chief executive and the fact that there is strong feeling over the cuts,' he said. Mr Jeff Evans, the regional officer of the CPSA Civil Service union, said: 'Senior management of Companies House do not have the confidence of staff. Staff will have to be convinced that the chief executive has the best interests of the agency at heart.' Members of the two unions had voted by 341 votes to 111 to hold a one-day strike in a ballot in which 65 per cent voted. The other regional offices of Companies House remained open during the day, but services requiring contact with the Cardiff office were severely curtailed. Mr Durham said that the cost-cutting was necessary to meet the financial objectives set down by ministers at a time when Companies House was experiencing weak demand for its services. He added that an anticipated upturn in the workload this year had not materialised. However, Mr Hill said work had started to increase again since May and that there was also a substantial backlog of work. 'If there is a recovery, obviously having the staff to meet the services is important,' he added.</p>

			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / 'Foreign investment' fuelled China boom China said yesterday that its boom had been fuelled by a record Dollars 27bn (Pounds 18bn) of foreign investment last year and that it was confident measures to slow the economic growth rate were proving effective. The investment total made China 'the country attracting the largest sum of foreign capital in a single year,' said Mr Chen Yuan, deputy governor of the People's Bank of China, the central bank. He gave no breakdown of the figure, which compared with an inflow of Dollars 11bn in 1992, itself more than double the total of 1991. Mr Chen said steps taken last year, including higher interest rates and curbs on bank lending to finance real estate speculation, had been intended to produce 'structural adjustment, not an across-the-board retrenchment. 'We aimed at a 'soft landing.' We think we are getting there,' Mr Chen said in a speech delivered by Mr Ma Yuzhen, China's ambassador to Britain, to a London conference organised by Thornton, the fund management group. Mr Chen was detained by meetings in Beijing. He was unusually candid about the debate in Beijing over the need to slow growth, admitting that 'there are still dissenting views on whether we prescribed the right medication, at the right time, with the right dosage.' Business people and high growth regions of China felt the measures were too harsh, while 'the IMF people and World Bank people warned of the dangerous and unpleasant consequences of not being firm against inflation or other maladies of the economy,' Mr Chen said. Mr Zhu Rongji, vice-premier in charge of the economy and central bank governor, indicated that moves to restore financial order would be maintained. Problems such as over-investment in fixed assets and rapid money supply growth 'had not been basically solved,' he said on state television yesterday. 'The pressure for inflation could rise at any time.' China is aiming to slow the economy to a 9 per cent growth rate in 1994 from 13 per cent rates in each of 1992 and 1993, and to cut inflation to about 12 per cent from about 17 per cent. Mr Chen said, however, that the slowing measures were only intended as a 'stop-gap' while China tackled the 'root cause' of its problems, which he described as the slow pace of reform of state enterprises and of the means of macro-economic control. 'Controlling economic growth rates is easy, we have done that before more than once, but we cannot solve the underlying problem and bring economic development on to a rapid, sustainable and healthy course without tackling the root cause,' he said. Under way were reorganisation of the corporate system into limited liability companies, with amalgamations encouraged and unworkable enterprises allowed to go bankrupt. Banking, tax, financial market and currency reforms were also in progress. Under new tax reforms, enterprise taxes were unified at 33 per cent, personal income tax rates were also unified, and VAT introduced. The treasury in Beijing would receive tariffs, consumption taxes and state enterprise income taxes, while local governments would receive business and local enterprise taxes, personal income taxes and land taxes.</p>

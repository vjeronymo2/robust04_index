			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Disgraceful Behavior of Flunkeyist Traitor" -- KCNA </F> headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, April 1 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim  Yong-sam at "talks" with Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa a few days ago raved that his group "has striven to  find a peaceful solution through dialogue" with the DPRK, that  there "is a limit to patience" and that "the young people who  are not swayed by the sentiments of the past should take the  lead" in "upgrading the relations" between Japan and South Korea.    MINJU CHOSON today brands this as a mean behavior of the  flunkeyist traitor who tries to maintain power in league with  outside forces, estranged from the nation.    The analyst says:    Still more intolerable is that the traitor Kim Yong-sam  tried  to completely cover up the crime-woven history of Japan, closing  his eyes to it.    Last year the traitor Kim Yong-sam invited Hosokawa to Seoul  and assured the latter that he would make a clean sheet of the  crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists against the Korean  people in the past in reward for Japan's intensified clamor over  the nuclear issue and cried for the "development of new  future-orientated relationship". This time, he flew to Japan  and flatteringly proposed it to promote from a new angle the  "development of relations", not allowing Japan's crime-woven  past to "affect the future."    The humiliating act of the traitor Kim Yong-sam is an  intolerable challenge to the unanimous demand of the Korean  people that Japan properly liquidate its past.    Far from asking the past crimes of the Japanese  imperialists,  he voluntarily proposed that they should no more be brought  forward. This reveals the sinister intention of the traitor, a  pro-American stooge, to carry his anti-DPRK scheme into practice  at any cost, with the "help" of Japan. In other words, he  intends to inveigle Japan with the United States into the  "international cooperation system" by all means and step up his  treacherous acts with the patronage of his U.S. and Japanese  masters.    History shows that those who committed treacheries, clinging  to outside forces, are sure to face a stern judgement by the  people. The destiny of Kim Yong-sam, a despicable flunkeyist  traitor, cannot be otherwise.</p>

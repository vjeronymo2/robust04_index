			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / UK Company News: ABF buys manufacturing base in US from Karlshamns Associated British Foods has bought the US operations of Karlshamns, the Swedish foods group, giving the UK company its first manufacturing presence in the US. ABF will use the subsidiary, to be renamed Abitec Corporation, as a base for making a wide variety of food ingredients. These will include stabilisers and emulsifiers which it already sells in British and continental markets to makers of bread, ice-cream, soups and other foods. 'We've been looking for a way to get into food ingredients in the US because they are more remunerative than some packaged foods,' Mr Garry Weston, ABF chairman, said. In common with other UK bakers, ABF has come under severe pricing pressure from supermarkets' own-label breads. ABF, the UK's leading baker, produces under its own brands such as Allinson's as well as supermarkets' brands. The assets being bought include a plant in Columbus, Ohio, and one in Janesville, Wisconsin, which process vegetable oils to produce food ingredients and products for healthcare. It makes a small profit on annual turnover of Dollars 150m (Pounds 95m). ABF had been negotiating with Karlshamns for more than a year. It declined to disclose the purchase price. The Swedish group, which had over-extended by expanding rapidly overseas during the last decade, has had to retrench by selling some subsidiaries. 'Over the next four or five years we will have invested about Dollars 100m' in US manufacturing, Mr Weston said. Turnover of Abitec Corporation could double over the same period.</p>

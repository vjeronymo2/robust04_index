			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR COINS: FRACTIONAL GOLD MET CURRENCY CRUNCH  </P> <P> Question: Could you give me some information about two gold coins I have  inherited from my 95-year-old mother? You can see how small they are from the  photocopy I have enclosed. The date on the circular one is 1857; the date on  the octagonal is 1859. On the reverse side there is an olive branch encircled  with the inscription "California Gold." These so-called coins are very thin and  have been kept in a gold locket my mother's entire lifetime. -- M.M.  </P> <P> Answer: Even using a magnifying glass, I can't make out the detail on your  coins, but the extremely small size is consistent with California fractional  gold, sometimes called California pioneer gold. The round and octagonal shapes  are also reflective of California gold.  </P> <P> Due to a variety of historical circumstances, the need for money in Gold Rush  California was filled by privately made gold coins in denominations of 25  cents, 50 cents and $1. Some of these unofficial coins from many different  minters had a Liberty head design, others had an Indian design. Most were  crudely made but they served the purpose of facilitating commerce in a region  short on -- and distrustful of -- cash but rich with gold.  </P> <P> For some reason, this is a rather neglected area of numismatics. While  California gold was widely circulated from 1852 to about 1882, it is estimated  that only about 5,000 pieces still exist. And these are in various sizes,  shapes, denominations, designs and varieties. Unfortunately, many look-alike  copies also exist. The telltale clue here is either a bear or the word Eureka,  which makes them worthless numismatically. Genuine pieces -- yours will have to  be authenticated -- are in the $50-to-$75 range and up.  </P> <P> Q: Please estimate the value of the following proof and mint sets we want to  evaluate for our children. The U.S. proof sets are: 1969, '70 and '71. The mint  sets are: 1963, '64, '65, '68 and '69. Also, there's a special mint set, 1966,  an American Revolution Bicentennial Washington piece, 1976, and an American  Revolution sterling silver medal (Adams-Henry). -- R.C.  </P> <P> A: Later-date U.S. proof and mint sets do not command a great premium at this  time. Perhaps it is still too soon for them to appreciate. Perhaps there are  just too many on the market. In any event, the 1969 proof set is $5, the '70 is  $10 and the '71 is $4. The 1963 mint set is $20, the '64 is $15, the '65 is  $10, the '68 is $6 and the '69 is $8. The 1966 special mint set is $7. Your  Washington piece has little or no collector value; the silver medal is worth  its silver content, about $5.  </P> <P> Q: I just came across a U.S. $5 bill, 1934 Series. Printed across the back is  the word Hawaii. Also, in two places on the front the numbers are in red, as is  the seal. Could you let me know if it has any value? -- N.S.  </P> <P> A: Your bill is a Hawaii overprint, made for use in the Islands. It's probably  worth about $7 or $8.  </P> <P> Q: I came across a stack of bills that were printed by the Japanese government,  presumably during wartime. They are in Mexican denominations ranging from 5  centavos to 100 pesos. Could these possibly be worth anything? -- J.P.J.  </P> <P> A: What you have is occupation currency. It was probably made for use in the  Philippines, not in Mexico, as you suggest. There are collectors of occupation  money, but the premium is not great. You'd have to shop around for the best  price.  </P> <P> Coin News  </P> <P> A commemorative medal honoring both the Bicentennial of Congress and the  inauguration of the first President is being offered by the United States  Capitol Historical Society. The 1989 medal (pictured) was sculpted by Marcel  Jovine and features John Adams, first president of the Senate, and Frederick  Muhlenberg, first Speaker of the House, on the obverse. The reverse depicts  George Washington's inauguration. Medals are $9 in 1 1/2-inch bronze, $34 in  3-inch bronze, $50 in 1 1/2-inch sterling silver proof, $300 in 3-inch sterling  silver, and $700 in 1 5/16-inch 18-karat gold. Order from the United States  Capitol Historical Society (chartered by Congress), 200 Maryland Ave. N.E.,  Washington, D.C. 20002, or telephone (202) 543-8919.  </P> <P> Coins commemorating the Bicentennial of Congress will be struck Wednesday  morning at the East Front of the Capitol Building in Washington. This will be  the first time since 1792 that official U.S. coins will be struck outside of a  Mint facility. Proceeds from the sales of this coin series will be used to  restore and preserve the Capitol Building. It is estimated that $22 million  will be raised.  </P> <P> Paper money collectors will be interested in a souvenir card featuring a Series  1907 $5 United States note. The note is distinguished by a portrait of Andrew  Jackson engraved by Alfred Sully and a red V with a banner draped across the  left side of the note. It is being issued by the Bureau of Engraving and  Printing in conjunction with the International Paper Money Show in Memphis,  Tenn., on June 23-25. The souvenir card (No. 972) is $5.50 by mail; postal  cancelled (No. 973), the card is $5.75. Order from the Bureau of Engraving and  Printing, Mail Order Sales, Room 602-11A, 14th and C streets S.W., Washington,  D.C. 20228.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Alpert cannot answer mail personally but will respond to numismatic questions  of general interest in this column.

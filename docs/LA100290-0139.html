			<p><P> October 2, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MICHEL LEIRIS; POET, SURREALIST LEADER  </P> <P> Michel Leiris, a writer who helped lead the surrealist movement in the 1920s  and later authored innovative studies of ethnic groups, has died at his country  home, associates said Monday. He was 89.  </P> <P> He died Sunday in the town of Saint Hilaire, southwest of Paris. The cause was  not disclosed.  </P> <P> Leiris published his first work at the age of 25 -- a collection of poems. He  became involved with surrealist writers and artists, and was a contributor to  the movement's journal, "The Surrealist Revolution."  </P> <P> He broke with the movement in 1929, and two years later joined a two-year  research mission across central Africa. Upon returning to France, he published  an account of the mission, "Phantom Africa," combining poetry and  stream-of-consciousness prose with more traditional ethnological analysis.  </P> <P> He also accepted a post at the Musee de l'Homme (Museum of Man) in Paris as  head of its section on sub-Saharan Africa.  </P> <P> Later works included "L'Age d'Homme" (The Age of Man) and "La Regle du Jeu"  (The Rule of the Game).  </P></p>

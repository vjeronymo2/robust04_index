			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): The fast way to a Japanese stomach - Emiko Terazono explains why Pillsbury succeeded where others failed in a challenging market Cracking the Japanese market is daunting enough for foreign food processing companies at any time; doing so in a period when demand is sluggish is even more challenging. Pillsbury Japan, the Japanese arm of the US food processing company, has managed to clear both hurdles by forming business relationships Japanese-style and introducing innovative products at lower prices. The company has seen strong growth in Japan at a time when most domestic and foreign food companies are struggling amid a sluggish economy and increasing competition. Building on its 'Green Giant' brand canned corn, Pillsbury Japan has carved itself a niche in the canned and frozen vegetables market, and sales have grown from Y2bn (Pounds 13m) in 1987 to Y10bn last year. Part of the success, says Toshi Mitamura, president of Pillsbury Japan, has been in maintaining good relations with its Japanese partners, businesses involved in product distribution and PR companies. It is essential to form a strong relationship with a company's management - even if it means late night drinking sessions and karaoke  - and to involve them in marketing plans from an early stage, he says. This aspect of doing business in Japan has been the Achilles heel for many foreign food makers. Forays into the Japanese market by companies which tried to go it alone such as Borden, the ice cream maker and Campbell Soup, have failed. But while establishing a favourable relationship with QP, which handles its canned vegetable line, and Nissui, a frozen foods company, which distributes Green Giant frozen vegetables, Pillsbury says it was careful to retain control of product development and the marketing of its brands. Another important factor, says Mitamura, is empowerment to the local head from the parent company. 'Japanese companies will not take you seriously if the local president is not given full authority over decisions.' Mitamura, who gained his expertise in the food industry at Morinaga, a Japanese dairy goods maker, and Mister Doughnuts of the US, adds that knowledge of the complex distribution system, the speed of introducing new products and knowing how to handle red tape at the Ministry of Health and Welfare is also important in the food business. Once in the Japanese market, expanding business has also been a challenge. Although Japan's Y32,152bn food processing market is one of the world's largest, growth has stagnated over the past few years. Pillsbury has tried to overcome this by introducing frozen vegetable products designed for the Japanese market. One product which other frozen food companies have followed is the burdock and carrot vegetable mix, often used in Japanese cooking. The research and development has paid off and the company now has 43.5 per cent of the frozen vegetable market. 'Product development is always necessary,' says Mitamura, adding that there is danger in total reliance on the parent company and the brand name. Mitamura says foreign food companies have an advantage over domestic companies because they can offer cheaper imports. With discounting already a trend in the Japanese retail sector, foreign companies can attract consumers without hurting profit margins by bringing in low-priced products processed in their manufacturing bases abroad. Lower import prices as a result of the yen's recent rise have therefore helped Pillsbury expand its product range in Japan. This month it will start offering its Dough Boy baking products, and last month it opened a food research and development centre - its first overseas technology centre outside the US - to target the Japanese and Asian markets. The expansion in the region comes at a time when growth in the US food market, Pillsbury's core market, is slowing and companies are being forced to look for earnings growth overseas. The fast-growing Asian economies present profit opportunities because a company can develop products in Asia and then offer them to the growing Asian population in the US Some analysts point out the danger in rapid expansion in new areas at a time when the Japanese economic recovery is at an early and tentative stage. 'Although market research may show demand, many foreign food companies have found themselves in trouble when trying to introduce new products,' says Patricia Horvath, foods analyst at brokers UBS Securities in Tokyo. At the same time this is a good moment to invest, says Mitamura. Most Japanese companies are reducing capital investment. Construction orders and property prices are on the decline, which made it easy for Pillsbury to find a contractor to build its new technology centre. However, he adds that the environment surrounding food manufacturers in Japan is becoming increasingly tough because of the rise in retailers' low-priced, private-brand labels. 'In order to survive, food manufacturers have two choices. Either become a sub-contractor for a retail group, or become a manufacturer with brands that offer innovative products at competitive prices,' he says.</p>

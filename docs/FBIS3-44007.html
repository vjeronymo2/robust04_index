It was on occasion of  the opening of the electoral campaign for the legislative  elections slated from 6 to 24 February. In his message, the  head of state recalled the promise he made solemnly after his  election as first president of the Fourth Republic to rally  together all Togolese within the new democratic institutions.  President Eyadema also recalled that the legislative election  campaign should be the framework of a debate that would  guarantee transparency in all proceedings. President Eyadema  called on all sides taking part in the parliamentarian election  to respect the freedom of one another, to abide by the principle  of non-violence, and the acceptance of differences.    Recalling his responsibility as guarantor of national unity,  the head of state called on voters and through them, on all  Togolese to make their differences an asset and not a liability.  He called on all sides to strictly abide by the rules of  democracy and called on Togolese to contribute to the success of  the legislative elections.    General Eyadema further said that Togolese were all equal  before the laws of the Republic, laws that are imposed on them.  The head of state recalled the consensus spirit that prevailed  during the preparation of the vote and recalled the difficult  trip of our country on the path towards democracy and that was  marred by an unprecedented sociopolitical and economic crisis.  He called on all Togolese to get down to work with courage and  to work with a spirit of sacrifice in order to relaunch our  country on the path of development. The head of state expressed  his gratitude to the workers who, despite the difficulties from  all fronts, continued to go to their work. That is why Gen.  Eyadema called on all the sons and daughters of the country to  initiate forgiveness and reconciliation and he then solemnly  pledged to respect the will of the people, that is, to bow to  the results of the forthcoming elections.</p>

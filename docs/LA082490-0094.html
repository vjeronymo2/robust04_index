			<p><P> August 24, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRADLEY SENDS SIGNAL TO END TRAFFIC RED TAPE  </P> <P> Residents of the city of Los Angeles seeking to slow the flow of traffic  through their neighborhoods had better prepare themselves for long waits.  </P> <P> At a special meeting of top officials in the city's Department of  Transportation on Thursday, Mayor Tom Bradley decried the red tape delaying  installation of crosswalks and traffic signals.  </P> <P> It takes 198 days just to consider requests for new traffic signals downtown,  Bradley said. Slow as that seems, it's better than in West Los Angeles, where  bureaucrats ponder such requests for 267 days.  </P> <P> In the San Fernando Valley, requests for new traffic lights take 225 days to be  decided upon.  </P> <P> And in the East San Fernando Valley, the department takes 272 to study requests  for a crosswalk.  </P> <P> "These kinds of delays are unacceptable," Bradley said. "I don't know what the  reason is. I hope you don't tell me you need more personnel."  </P> <P> In an effort to reduce the delays, Bradley said he will hold similar meetings  in the future and demand monthly or quarterly reports from transportation  officials.  </P> <P> The people of Los Angeles, he said, shouldn't be told "it will take eight or  nine months" to review a crosswalk.  </P></p>

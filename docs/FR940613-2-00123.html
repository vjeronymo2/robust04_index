			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (iii) If funds remain available in either category and there are unmet needs in the other category, the excess funds will be reallocated to the category in which additional funding is needed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) If applications from CGP agencies are not fully funded, those agencies will be required to revise their vacancy reduction plans and budgets to indicate which items will be funded with the amounts reserved for the CGP agency under this program and state alternative plans for unfunded vacancies. To the extent that funds are prorated for its units averaging more than $8,000 in costs, each CGP agency receiving program funds under paragraph (1)(a)(ii) of that definition of ``eligible unit'' in Section I.D, ``Definitions,'' will be required to commit a portion of the funds the agency had agreed to commit from independent resources if those units had been funded in the full amount requested. This portion will be determined by applying (to the total commitment made in the application) the ratio of funding received for those units to funding requested for those units. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Remaining funds.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If funds remain available after funding all eligible activities under paragraphs (a) and (b) of Section I.J(3), ``Funding Decisions,'' of this NOFA, a PHA may be reimbursed for costs, or a portion of costs, associated with rehabilitating certain occupied units. The PHA must have fewer vacancies on the date of its application than it had on September 1, 1993, and must have expended funds on those units in reasonable anticipation of reimbursement from Vacancy Reduction Program funds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> K. Implementation of Plan and Other Programs <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) An applicant's vacancy reduction plan must be approved before an application is funded under this NOFA even though, in most cases, the plan will cover the physical treatment of many units that are not eligible under this NOFA. The PHA is expected to implement the plan using available funds, including the operating budget and CGP funds, and by requesting funds under discretionary programs, including CIAP and the Severely Distressed Public Housing Program. HUD will monitor implementation of the vacancy reduction plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Eligible units that a PHA originally planned to fund with CGP funds may also be funded under this NOFA, as long as they are not currently under contract. The PHA may then reprogram its CGP funds to other work set forth in the Five-Year Action Plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II.

			<p>BFN     [Text] On Wednesday morning President Boris Yeltsin might  have a meeting with the chairmen of the two chambers of the  Russian Federal Assembly Vladimir Shumeyko and Ivan Rybkin. The  draft agreement on civic accord is expected to be the main item  of discussion.    On Monday evening the document was reportedly sent by the  president to the State Duma. The draft has been circulated  among parliamentary groups for discussion.    The text submitted to the State Duma does not in fact differ  from the version Yeltsin [submitted] to the speakers of the  houses last Thursday. The only amendment made by Yeltsin was the  exclusion from the section on the social and economic policies  of the recognition of the need to raise salaries and wages with  due account to inflation, to guarantee their timely payment, to  hold back the prices of key food stuffs, to take steps to  guarantee employment and to help territories where the threat of  unemployment is the greatest.    Interfax has been informed of Rybkin writing a letter to the  president requesting to replace the section on the security of  individuals and the state by a more detailed version approved in  advance by the working group that drafted the document.</p>

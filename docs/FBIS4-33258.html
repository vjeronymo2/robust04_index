			<p>BFN     [Text] On 1 June, Israeli Ambassador Shmu'el Merom stated  he personally was doing everything he could to stop the closure  of his country's embassy in Asuncion, and he mentioned that this  possibility had no links with an alleged "irritation" with the  Paraguayan Government. "On the contrary, our bilateral relations  are getting better and better every day through cooperation  agreements," he said.    He also pointed out the fact that Paraguay has decided to  open an embassy in Israel is a demonstration of the excellent  bilateral relations. "With this, President Juan Carlos Wasmosy  has kept his word," Merom stressed.    The diplomat also indicated that the probable closure of his  country's embassy is being evaluated by an Embassy Section  Commission and that within two weeks a final decision will be  made, and he emphatically rejected the fact that the decision  could be linked to alleged Israeli "irritation" over military  matters, as it had been given to understand.    Merom also indicated that there is not a large Jewish colony  in Paraguay, some 900 people. He also mentioned that his  country's important decisions were made in Jerusalem, the  capital, and not Tel Aviv.    He reiterated that if the embassy's closure is approved, the  appropriate steps will be followed and the announcement will be  made in the formal manner. He pointed out that cultural and  other types of cooperation agreements will follow their normal  courses through a concurrent ambassador or a permanent one in  Asuncion. "The current excellent relations between Paraguay and  Israel will continue to progress for the satisfaction of both  parties," the ambassador said.    Merom also clarified that an eventual decision by his  government has nothing to do with the United States, and he also  denied that his government is an "unconditional ally" of the  United States.</p>

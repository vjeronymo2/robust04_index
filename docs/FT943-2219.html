			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Fall in UK sales pushes Magnolia to Pounds 0.3m loss Following its warning in June that first half performance would be disappointing, Magnolia, the picture frame and reproductions company, turned in a loss of Pounds 309,000 against a profit of Pounds 76,000 last time and announced a rationalisation in its UK operations. Turnover for the six months to June 30 was down from Pounds 9.05m to Pounds 8.41m. This was largely as a result of a decline in the UK market for traditional wooden mouldings, said Mr David Wallrock, chairman. Demand had been in steady decline throughout the recession and continued to be suppressed by the flat housing market and increasing competition from plastic frames. As a result, the group is to rationalise its UK wholesale business through a writedown of stocks. The costs are expected to have little impact on borrowings. The plastic moulding side, established last year, now accounts for 50 per cent of production and the group is also looking overseas for growth. Lira, the Czech picture framing company acquired in June, has been trading above budget but has not contributed to these results. There were losses per share of 5.39p (earnings 0.92p).</p>

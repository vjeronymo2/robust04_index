			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / World News in Brief: Icy meeting for Kerrigan and Harding Rival US skaters Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding were together on the ice for the first time since Kerrigan (pictured in white) was hit on the knee by a man hired by Harding's ex-husband. The skaters were practising in Norway in preparation for the Winter Olympics. The attack, in January, was purportedly aimed at injuring Kerrigan so she would not be able to compete in the event, and Harding is under investigation for her alleged role. She has denied planning the assault but admitted not going to the authorities after learning about the plot.</p>

			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Chemring makes Pounds 4.8m offer for Kembrey Chemring, the maker of anti-missile chaff, distress rockets and waterproof clothes, has made a recommended offer for Kembrey valuing the group at Pounds 4.8m or 17.6p per share. Irrevocable undertakings have been received by directors of Kembrey, representing about 27.5 per cent of the share capital. As a consequence of its acquisition policy and through developing core activities, Chemring's indebtedness at July 15 1994 stood at some Pounds 4.4m. Consequently it plans to raise about Pounds 5.4m before expenses, via a placing of 1.97m new ordinary shares at 272p each, subject to a 1-for-10 open offer to shareholders. Chemring yesterday also forecast that it would pay a final dividend of 6.56p for the year to September 30, making a total of 9.8p (9p). Kembrey is principally engaged in the manufacture of marine survivor location products, as well as consumable refractory materials and precision components. Kembrey shares added 4p to 16p. Chemring shares were unchanged at 299p.</p>

			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Reuters revises Globex contract Reuters, the UK information company, has agreed to continue its loss-making venture into electronic futures trading by revising its Globex operating contract with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. However, the revised contract has not been endorsed by the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), the world's busiest futures exchange, and Reuters' other partner in the Globex venture. The new arrangement promises to shore up the flagging system, which was designed to supplement daytime futures trading at the world's biggest exchanges by providing after-hours electronic markets. Reuters invested an estimated Dollars 100m (Pounds 68m) to develop Globex, which carries futures and options products listed on the CME, the CBOT and Matif, the French futures exchange. However, since its launch two years ago, the system has drawn lower volume than forecast, and no other exchanges have joined it. This year, with volatile financial markets boosting derivatives contracts of all kinds, Globex volume has risen, but still remains below target. Wednesday's agreement provides a fallback two-year management plan for Globex in case the current contract collapses next month. In April either of the two Chicago futures exchanges or Reuters have the option not to renew the existing contract. The CBOT, wary of the threat electronic trading poses to its daytime markets, and unwilling to carry expenses related to Globex operations, has criticised the system and is not expected to renew its participation. Under the new plan, Reuters releases participating futures exchanges from having to guarantee large numbers of Globex terminal placements or pay compensatory fees. The plan also relieves other financial obligations to the exchanges, and creates a management consortium that gives any participating exchange equal voice in governance. Globex executives expected the new plan to appeal to other world futures exchanges. In particular, they hope the terms will prompt a speedy consideration of a 'new Globex' by London's Liffe. Liffe is considered crucial to the long-term success of the project, and would compensate for the absence of the CBOT. Globex executives are continuing to try and preserve the the CBOT's participation in some form.</p>

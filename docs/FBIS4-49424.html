			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 5 (XINHUA) -- Chinese copyright  violators will henceforth be faced with imprisonment of up to  five years, detention, and/or fines.    This has been provided in a draft decision on punishing  criminals who violate copyrights submitted to the Standing  Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), China's  legislature, for deliberation today.    The draft decision also designated that all reproductions  that violate copyrights, illegal income from them, and  materials, tools, facilities and other property used for this  purpose will be confiscated no matter whether they belong to an  individual person or a work unit.    Director of the Legislative Affairs Work Committee of the  NPC  Standing Committee Gu Angran explained to the legislators that  piracy of books, audio and video tapes, and computer software  has become quite rampant in recent years, in illegal attempts to  reap huge profits.    "This has infringed upon the rights of the authors and  destroyed the normal order of the socialist cultural market and  economic activities," said the director.    "It has also affected foreign trade of the country and its  cultural and scientific exchanges and cooperation with foreign  countries," he said, adding that perpetrators of this kind of  activity should be severely punished.    The legal expert stressed that the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade (GATT) also demands judicial punishment in  domestic laws for such crimes violating intellectual property  rights.    The draft decision also provides that those who sell illegal  reproductions with clear knowledge of their origin and have  illegally reaped large sums of money will be punished with two  years' imprisonment, detention and/or fines; if their illegal  profits are especially big, they will be punished with two to  five years' imprisonment, together with fines.</p>

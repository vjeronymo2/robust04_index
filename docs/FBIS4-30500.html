			<p>BFN     [Text] A senior UN official reported that Australia,  Canada, and the United States expressed their desire for a  quicker repatriation of Hmong refugees to Laos by creating  industrial jobs in LPDR for them. Those Hmong hilltribesmen  have been living at refugee centers in Thailand for almost 20  years and have become urbanized. It is not enough to just  arrange for those people to return and settle down in the  countryside of Laos.    UNHCR Representative to Thailand Ruprecht von Arnim proposed  that an industrial zone be established in Laos where those  refugees can make goods like garments or shoes. The UNHCR  representative to Thailand and senior officials of Laos and  Thailand are meeting in Bangkok on 27-28 June to discuss the  repatriation of Lao refugees. The Thai delegation is led by  Khachatphai Burutphat, deputy secretary general of the National  Security Council. The Lao delegation is led by a director  general from the Lao Foreign Ministry.    The meeting will try to find ways to speed up repatriation  of  Lao refugees in accordance with the wishes of Thailand.  Thailand reiterated its plan to close Ban Na Pho center by the  end of this year. There are at present about 12,000 refugees at  the center which is in Nakhon Phanom. It is believed only 3,000  will leave for Laos in the next six months.</p>

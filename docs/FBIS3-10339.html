Ferrera accused members of the Armed Forces who have managed  Hondutel of committing acts of corruption, although he clarified  that there are some honest soldiers. Ferrera questioned those  opposed to Hondutel's privatization, because he believes it is a  profitable enterprise. He added that an enterprise should be  sold when it is profitable in order to receive good offers and  not when it goes bankrupt.    With regard to the fears of Hondutel employees, he said  those  who are working efficiently should not worry but noted that "in  the private sector inefficient workers are fired."    He suggested that the privatization process be handled  openly  in order to avoid returning to the practice of "state  enterprises that belong to all Hondurans ending up in the hands  of a few opportunists."    He said some appraisals have been made to determine the sum  that will be asked for this enterprise, adding that in his  opinion it needs new management to give it the modern techniques  demanded by the telecommunications world. In Ferrera's opinion,  international telecommunications enterprises such as AT&amp;T and  Motorola will have to participate in the process. He stressed  that there will be various offers in view of Hondutel's  profitability, despite its bad administration and a scandalous  theft that was detected.    He added that the profit, more than the result of a good  administration, is due to the administration's decision to raise  the tariffs paid by its users. He said that in Hondutel there  has been "a scandalous theft; when the best mechanisms are not  used to manage an enterprise, there is corruption; it cannot be  described any other way."    Ferrera said the Armed Forces have been part of that  corruption. "If any Honduran can show me that there has been no  corruption in Hondutel's management, I will resign my post as  finance minister," he stressed. "They (the soldiers) are  involved in corruption," he said, but noted that just as there  are corrupt soldiers there are also some honest ones.</p>

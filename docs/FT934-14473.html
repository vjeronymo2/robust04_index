			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Leeds and N&amp;P terms still unclear LEEDS Permanent Building Society said yesterday that it still had to resolve a number of 'difficult issues' with National &amp; Provincial in order to produce a business plan for a merged society by the end of this month. The two boards are scheduled to meet in the first week of next month to approve a business plan that would allow the largest ever building society merger to take place. However, senior managers are still trying to decide terms. Leeds said it did not believe that differences would be enough to block a merger, and that it was normal in so big a merger to encounter some obstacles. 'It is not an easy task, and no one expected it just to sail through.' Some senior managers of the Leeds are thought by some of its middle managers to be unhappy at aspects of the merger, including the fact that Mr David O'Brien, chief executive of N&amp;P, will take the same role in the merged society. The Leeds' board is due to meet on November 2 and N&amp;P's board on November 4 to consider the joint business plan. It would then go forward for approval to the Building Societies Commission, which supervises the industry. N&amp;P said that it believed the merger process was proceeding as expected, but that the merger of two large and complex organisations was bound to raise issues, and so lead to speculation about whether it faced difficulty. The planned merger, announced in August, will eventually have to be approved by the 3.3m members of the two societies. The societies have not yet decided whether to offer their savings members a bonus in order to win approval. The business plan is being drawn up by teams of managers of the two societies, which are analysing various aspects of the businesses. These include the mortgage lending side of their activities, and retail savings operations. The merger is intended to create the UK's third largest society, just behind Nationwide. It would combine the Pounds 18.3bn assets of the Leeds, currently the fifth largest, with the Pounds 12bn of N&amp;P, the eighth largest.</p>

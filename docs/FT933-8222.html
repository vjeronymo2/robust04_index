			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Aminex heads for Siberian oil fields THE Russian government has taken an indirect stake in a small Irish oil exploration company in a move designed to open up Siberian oil fields frozen by years of neglect. Aminex, the exploration tiddler which recently lost its hostile battle for fellow exploration group Tuskar Resources, said yesterday it expected to announce within weeks a deal to rebuild a Siberian oil field. The group's shares rose sharply on the news, defying the market trend, and closed 25 per cent higher at 37 1/2 p. It also emerged yesterday that Zarubezhneftj (Russian Foreign Trade Corporation), a state-owned body, indirectly owned 17 per cent of Aminex through its 49 per cent stake in East West Oil. East West, a private company controlled by Russian shareholders, owns more then 34 per cent of Aminex. Mr Brian Hall, chairman of Aminex, said he thought it was the first time the Russian body had invested in a western company. Zarubezhneftj is responsible for procuring oilfield equipment for the Russian Ministry of Fuel and energy, and oversees the government's foreign exploration. Aminex has appointed Mr Alexander Sarukhanov, deputy director general of Zarubezhneftj and a petroleum engineer, as a non-executive director. Mr Sarukhanov was closely involved with Russia's oil production joint venture with the Vietnamese government. Mr Hall said Aminex would not be exploring in Siberia. Instead, it would rebuild the infrastructure of existing fields relying heavily on subcontracting. 'So much production has been shut in through neglect,' Mr Hall said.</p>

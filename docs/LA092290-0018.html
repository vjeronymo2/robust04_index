			<p><P> September 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LET RICKEY RENEGE BEFORE RENEGOTIATION  </P> <P> Baseball owners should smarten up and discontinue any renegotiating. If Rickey  Henderson isn't satisfied with $3 million a year, let him take his bat and  glove and go home.  </P> <P> Then they should prosecute him for not honoring a contract he freely signed.  Take it for what it's worth, Rickey. Play ball, collect your $60,000 a week and  shut up.  </P> <P> MARK CRITTENDEN  </P> <P> West Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / As They Say in Europe: Free votes in an ideal election For those interested in Europe or elections, European elections are a dead loss. There is no meaningful result and people 'don't know what they are voting for'. For the political philosopher, however, they are a goldmine. The cryptic cartoon in El Pais last Monday showed a book written by Rousseau and other savants entitled 'All elections are general'. The International Herald Tribune said all elections were local. In fact, the European poll provided the platonic ideal of an election. How would you vote if you were not constrained by fears of the result? How would you vote if greed and self-interest played no role and your sole aim was to reward virtue and punish vice? Thus the British were able to do what they told the country's credulous opinion pollsters they would do in 1992. They voted for the party that promised more money for the National Health Service, and against the government. The Dutch voted for the party they chucked out last month because it wanted to curb the country's bloated welfare services. The Germans, unimaginatively, used the occasion to vote as they always do; the Italians to express their faith in their new Duce and his 'post fascist' hangers on. The Spanish showed that they really disapprove of corruption and the Belgians chose their esoteric mosaic of parties which ensures every government in Brussels is the same. As usual the British, modestly, and the French, spectacularly, provided the drama. The French, however, took most advantage of the unusual opportunities offered by Euro-voting. As Liberation remarked: 'The European elections are always more exciting after the vote than before.' There was huge support for symbolic candidates. Thus Phillipe de Villiers and Sir James Goldsmith gained an eighth of the vote for their anti-Brussels, anti-free trade campaign which suggested that peace, prosperity and full employment would reign again in France once prohibitive tariffs were placed on imports of Indonesian underpants. Bernard Tapie, the businessman arraigned on corruption charges and master of the Marseilles football team, also did well, largely thanks to the under-25s. As Liberation pointed out, Tapie represented the divisions between the official left and ordinary voters while de Villiers 'chewed up the heart of the electorate of the right'. So the Euro-vote in France resurrected ancient reflexes and anointed the fashionable rebel. There is little room in a normal, general election for Bonapartism and glamorous rascals. Such attractive opportunities do not exist in any election in Germany. There the occasion was taken seriously, but not seriously enough, and the Frankfurter Allgemeine had to issue its standard indictment: 'The difficulty of direct elections to the European Parliament is as always that the voters have no basic understanding of what they are voting for. There are not the usual alternatives of 'government and opposition'.' It lamented the lack of what it called 'European parties'. The trouble with such a notion is that it would allow no room for diversity. Anti-Euro forces are powerful in most countries but in each case they resent different aspects of the Union - usually those which make membership acceptable to sceptics elsewhere. A cross-border Eurosceptic party would make as much sense as a cross-border Nazi party. It would exist to fight itself. German gloom was taken to its logical conclusion by the Suddeutsche Zeitung: 'The Social Democrats lost, the Free Democrats lost, the Bonn coalition lost. The Red-Green Alternative lost no less and finally Europe lost. For Europe was discussed, before the poll and afterwards, as little as in a domestic election.' This was a universal complaint. But the paradox is that the day is coming when European issues will dominate domestic elections. As people catch on to how much Brussels and the European parliament matter they will look more to their national governments to defend their national interests. I look forward to reading diatribes on the way national issues have become 'submerged in ill-informed debates about the 'future of Europe'.'

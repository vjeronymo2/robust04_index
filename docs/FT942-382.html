			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Granada merges two sales units Granada Group yesterday moved to unite the two television advertising sales houses brought under one roof when the company acquired London Weekend Television. The Time Exchange - a joint venture with Scottish Television and Laser, the old LWT company - will be replaced by a new operation to be known as Laser. It will sell the airtime of Granada, LWT, Yorkshire-Tyne Tees and Border Television - a total of just under 25 per cent of all UK television advertising, the maximum permitted. Mr Mick Desmond, currently managing director of The Time Exchange will be chief executive of the new company, which will begin operations on September 1. Granada said yesterday it would be the biggest television advertising sales house in the UK. Significant benefit is expected from the savings that will flow from putting the two together and from Laser's extra clout in the market. Mr Ron Miller, chief executive of Laser Sales, will leave at the end of July. He was offered, but declined, the chairmanship of the new sales house saying he did not wish to take on such a workload at this stage in his career. Mr Miller, who is 58, made some Pounds 9m from the LWT management share scheme. The Time Exchange will be eventually wound up and Scottish is already in negotiations to join another sales house.</p>

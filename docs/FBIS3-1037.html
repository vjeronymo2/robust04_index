			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The opposition Union for Democracy and Social  Development of Equatorial Guinea [UDDS] has once again expressed  itself in very strong terms. It has called on the Spanish,  French, and U.S. Governments, and all democratic governments not  to receive the delegation which the Equatorial Guinean president  sent out on a lengthy tour of Western capitals yesterday. It  also called on them not to trust the demagogic speeches of the  delegation as President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo continues  to stifle the democratic process and daily violates human rights.    The opposition cited the closure two weeks ago of all  opposition party offices, the multiple arrests and torture of  opposition activists and members, and last week's assassination  of Gendarmerie Corporal Eliza Ngomove Abata. Furthermore, UDDS  appealed to the international community and Amnesty  International for urgent intervention in Equatorial Guinea on  behalf of political prisoners and for the respect of human  rights.</p>

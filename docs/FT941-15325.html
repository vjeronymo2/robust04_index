			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Fitzpatrick for market via reverse takeover One of the UK's largest cable television duct layers, JP Fitzpatrick (Cable TV), is coming to the market through a Pounds 8.75m cash and paper reverse takeover by Baillie Gifford Technology, the shell investment trust whose shares were suspended at 31p late last month pending an announcement. BGT, which appointed City dealmakers Mr Luke Johnson and Mr Stephen Hargrave to its board in November, plans to acquire the specialist cable ducting group and its sister company, JP Fitzpatrick Construction. Mr Johnson said yesterday: 'The acquisitions will provide BGT with the opportunity to enter the fast expanding cable television market. It provides the company and its shareholders with a dynamic new business in a growing market.' The purchase price will be satisfied through the issue of 39.4m shares to the vendors, Pounds 4.7m of loan notes and Pounds 110,000 of cash which will be funded from the proceeds of a placing and rights issue. BGT plans to raise a total of Pounds 7.6m after expenses through a placing by Greig Middleton of 48m new ordinary shares at 10p each and a 3-for-2 rights issue of 33.3m shares at the same price. The rights issue is underwritten by Hill Samuel. The balance of the new funds raised will provide working capital for the enlarged group which will have a market capitalisation of about Pounds 14m at the rights issue price and which plans to change its name to Utility Cable.</p>

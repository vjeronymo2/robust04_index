			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: UK insurance Last week's merger of the Australian subsidiaries of Royal and Sun Alliance  -just like General Accident's purchase of the Pru's Canadian non-life business a day earlier - can be seen on one level as a mere footnote to empire. UK composites simply cannot afford poor performing overseas activities these days, even where they just represent a small part of their revenues. As the two deals just announced illustrate, the search is on for ways to make more profitable the hodge podge of businesses - often based in former British colonies - inherited in the UK insurance merger wave of the 1950s and 1960s. Sun appears to have taken the initiative in Australia, but the move fits in neatly with Royal's avowed long-term strategy. Given the company's relatively weak solvency ratio - brought about largely by its huge recent losses on mortgage guarantee business - it is easy to jibe that such joint ventures are primarily defensive. But that is a little unfair. Capital is scarce throughout the sector - and management talent thin on the ground in many overseas operations - so it surely makes sense to combine forces to achieve critical mass where local conditions allow. Royal's attempt to implement this thinking closer to home - through its Epic network with Germany's AMB and Fondiaria of Italy - may so far be proving a bit avant garde for its continental partners. But with the risks of outright takeover demonstrated in Scandinavia this year, Epic may yet prove a more durable European solution. All this raises the question of whether the UK composites should co-operate more in their own backyard. The conventional industry view is that further concentration would raise monopoly problems. But one wonders whether the real problem is a lack of boardroom will.</p>

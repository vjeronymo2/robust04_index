			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Investment and Saving): A shock before buying  -Bids Browning-Ferris Industries, confident of winning its hostile Pounds 391m bid for Attwoods of the UK, received a rude shock yesterday morning. Just five hours before its bid closed, a white knight entered the fray with the promise of a higher offer. Ikotek, a subsidiary of an unknown private Canadian group, Sieber, pledged to pay shareholders 130p in cash, plus the 3.25p final dividend, if BFI's bid failed. The new offer valued Attwoods at about Pounds 433m. The details and certainty of the bid were unclear, however. Ikotek's was not a firm offer and, according to the company's own advisers, it could walk away at any time. As a result, most shareholders opted to back the bid on the table and BFI held about 55 per cent when the offer closed at 1pm, London time. Fewer than 10 shareholders, representing significantly less than 1 per cent of Attwoods, withdrew their acceptance of BFI's bid. British Aerospace and GEC took a breather in their battle for VSEL. Neither side changed its offer or tried to buy VSEL shares in the market-place and all eyes are now on Michael Heseltine, the Trade Secretary, who is due to announce by December 7 if either bid will be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Arbitrageurs, however, were busy buying VSEL shares in the expectation of an increased offer by GEC. As neither bid is expected to be referred, BAe and GEC will have to slug it out in the market. GEC has until December 17 to make a final offer. Emerson Electric's agreed 525p-a-share bid for Powys-based Control Techniques was hardly a surprise since the two companies announced early last month they were involved in negotiations. Nevertheless the bid, which values the electronic drives specialist at Pounds 204m, offers Control's shareholders a reasonable deal. The offer price represents a premium of more than 36 per cent over the share price immediately before the announcement of take-over talks, as well as an historic multiple of 26.6 and about 18 times prospective earnings. Emerson, a US group which already held a 29.4 per cent stake in Control, picked up a further 3.07m shares in the market on Thursday. Including irrevocable acceptances, the US group either holds or has agreed to buy a total of 20.4m shares, representing 52.5 per cent of the company.</p>

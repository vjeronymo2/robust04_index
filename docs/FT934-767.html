			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / Bombay scam puts minister under threat India's health minister was under pressure from the opposition to resign yesterday after being heavily criticised in a parliamentary report on the Rs40bn (Pounds 850m) Bombay securities market scandal. The report, published on Tuesday, said Mr B. Shankaranand, when oil minister and chairman of the Oil India Development Board, a state enterprise, had violated prudential norms in his personal supervision of the board's investments. The board deposited Rs2.08bn with investment companies which have since defaulted on repayments. The joint parliamentary committee's report was a comprehensive indictment of India's financial system, including the ministry of finance, the Reserve Bank of India (the central bank), stockbrokers and commercial banks, particularly foreign banks. It urged the government to suspend the banking licences of ANZ Grindlays of Australia, Standard Chartered Bank of the UK, and Citibank and Bank of America of the US. Standard Chartered, which suffered a Pounds 305m loss from the scam, said it was 'surprised and disappointed' by the report's conclusion that foreign banks originated the scam and were the 'biggest players'. 'We would strongly dispute that,' a spokesman in London said, adding that the contention was at odds with the evidence laid out in the report itself. The spokesman said: 'It would be very unjust for foreign banks to be singled out for possible stringent penalties unless similar action is taken against Indian banks which are proved to have been involved in similar irregularities.' Yesterday, shares in Australia and New Zealand Banking Corporation, the Melbourne-based institution whose ANZ Grindlays operation was one of four foreign banks slammed by the committee, fell about 2 per cent. Mr Don Mercer, ANZ's chief executive, said it was difficult to comment without having seen the report, but added: 'Early indications are that it contains no new material'. He said the bank was concerned by 'the apparent implication that foreign banks behaved in any way differently from local banks in relation to market practices at the time'. Citibank's Bombay office said it now complied with all internal and external regulatory requirements. The Indian parliament will debate the report today. The Bharatiya Janata Party, the right-wing Hindu opposition party, urged the government to take action against Mr Shankaranand. In Bombay, India's commercial capital, reaction to the report was muted. Commercial bankers said the central bank would be under pressure sooner or later to respond to the report, which condemned it for lax supervision of the markets. On the Bombay Stock Exchange, there was no trading for a seventh day because of a strike by brokers protesting against a planned clampdown on forward trading by the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the markets watchdog. A senior BSE official said the exchange would follow up the criticisms made in the parliamentary report. MPs reserved some of their toughest comments for the stock market which they said was racked by insider trading, poor transparency and routine flouting of regulations. The parliamentary committee spent over a year investigating the affair, which erupted in April 1992 when evidence emerged that money was being illegally siphoned out of banks and into the stock market. The scandal resulted in a cabinet minister's resignation and the arrest of leading businessmen and brokers.</p>

Washington has refused to extend immediately the 16-nation  Transatlantic alliance's security umbrella to Central and  Eastern European nations, but offered verbal solace instead.    "The security of the states that lie between Western Europe  and Russia affects the security of America," said Vice President  Al Gore in a speech today at the Institute of World Affairs in  Milwaukee, Wisconsin.    But words are far from formal and quick membership in NATO  that countries such as Poland, Hungary, the Czech and Slovak  Republics are desperately seeking.    Washington's "partnership for peace" proposal, which Clinton  will formally present to the NATO summit next week in Brussels,  Belgium, only gives the applicants a "junior membership."    Under the U.S. plan, any Central and Eastern European  nation,  including republics of the former Soviet Union, can become a  "partner for peace" in NATO and participate in military training  and political cooperation.    Polish President Lech Walesa described the Washington  proposal as "short-sighted and irresponsible." The criticism  was echoed by other Eastern European leaders.    It is unclear whether John Shalikashvili, chairman of the  U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Madeleine Albright, Washington's  ambassador to the U.N., will be able to convince the leaders  when they visit the area, starting today.    Shalikashvili and Albright will join Clinton in Prague next  week in meetings with leaders of the Czech Republic, Poland,  Hungary and the Slovak Republic.    Clinton had planned to deliver the Milwaukee speech himself,  but his 70-year-old mother's death earlier today prompted the  change.    However, he will depart for Europe Saturday [8 January]  night  as scheduled.    This will be one of his three planned trips to Europe this  year. The other two occasions are the celebration of the 50th  anniversary of D-Day in the Second World War in France and the  Group of Seven's annual economic summit in Italy.</p>

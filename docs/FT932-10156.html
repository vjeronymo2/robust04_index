			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / UK comes close to wide-screen TV pact BRITAIN yesterday came closer than ever to agreeing a European strategy for developing advanced cinema-quality television, but blocked a deal after a funding dispute. EC ministers will discuss the issue again on June 16. Failure to agree then could kill the Commission's seven-year-old ambition to back European advanced television against US and Japanese competition. Over the past 18 months, Britain has argued for changes in Commission plans to kick-start the EC market for wide-screen television, and constantly sought justification for proposed spending. It agreed yesterday that a Danish compromise met many objections. Brussels will thus start work on amending earlier legislation in line with the proposed new strategy. It will also begin examining how to develop European digital high-definition television, the technology Britain believes will supersede EC-backed standards. Mr Edward Leigh, British industry minister, indicated earlier that the UK would oppose any funding plan which cost the EC more than Ecu150m (Pounds 118m) between now and the end of 1996. The other countries said they could only agree to Ecu285m, against the Ecu850m first proposed by Brussels last year. All but the Netherlands said they could even accept an Ecu226m plan. Under the plan backed by 11 member states, the Community would put up Ecu200m to develop programmes in the new wide-screen format, conditional on equal industry funding. A further Ecu85m (to be boosted by Ecu21m of industry funding) would be held in reserve for projects submitted later by countries with less developed audiovisual sectors.</p>

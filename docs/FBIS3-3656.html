The region, including Sichuan, Yunnan and Guizhou Provinces,  Guangxi Zhuang and Tibet Autonomous Regions, and the cities of  Chengdu and Chongqing, established an economic coordination  committee 10 years ago.    The seven partners aimed to build a mutual market in the  area  and open to the markets in Southeast and South Asia. They  removed barriers from among the provinces and opened their  markets to each other.    In the past decade, they held more than 100 commodity fairs  and trade talks, which succeeded with a total business volume of  40 billion yuan.    More than 30 banks in this area have also joined hands to  support the economic development. In the past six years, they  poured loans of more than 60 billion yuan into local enterprises.    With an 8,800-km border, the southwest China economic  coordination zone has established more than ten border economic  development areas and opened more than 40 border trade ports.  Thus the export volume in this area has increased quickly in  recent years. The total foreign trade volume last year reached  five billion U.S. dollars and its border trade volume amounted  to five billion yuan.    These provinces and regions also organized several  investment  promotion fairs in southeast and south Asia and introduced  billions of dollars in overseas investment.    They organized economic activities in accordance with market  needs. Since they established the economic coordination zone 10  years ago, they have signed more than 11,000 economic  cooperation projects among which more than 6,000 have been put  into operation.    They jointly invested over 200 million yuan to build 49  trans-provincial roads, which have now extended to a total of  more than 20,000 km. Some railways, post and telecommunications  projects and satellite communication stations are now under  construction.    A fund of more than 1.3 billion yuan has been collected to  build power plants and chemical fertilizer factories in the area.    At the beginning of the 1980s, however, the total industrial  and agricultural production value per capita in this area was  320 yuan lower than that in other areas although the region  covers a total area of over 2.5 million sq km and is inhabited  by 225 million people.    By 1993, the total industrial and agricultural production  value tripled that of 10 years ago.    A few days ago, the seven partners held a liaison meeting in  Chengdu, capital of Sichuan Province, and inaugurated a  publicity organizing committee, which will focus on promoting  the image of southwest China.</p>

			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Moskvich car plant closes THE Moskvich car plant, one of the giants of Russian industry, has closed because it lacks parts and funds. The vehicle plant named after Lenin's Young Communist League and known as AZKL, shut its car production line yesterday after supplies of engines from the Ufa plant in the Russian republic of Bashkortostan dried up. The engine plant is facing a deficit of Rbs14bn in the first quarter of this year, and has written to Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, demanding a subsidy to cover it. The Ufa lines stopped on Tuesday when they ran out of raw materials and parts. Mr Yuri Borodin, Moskvich's general director, yesterday blamed the 'complete absence of state regulation in this basic branch of engineering.' Moskvich cars, whose most recent model is the Aleko five-door hatchback, have for more than two decades been one of the principal vehicle exports of Russia. The plant has been seeking foreign investors. The main problem for Ufa is its dependence on the military, which takes four-fifths of its engines. Military spending was cut dramatically last year. However, the draft budget before parliament includes a 32 per cent rise. Another, smaller car plant in Izhevsk is also threatened with closure because of the lack of engines.</p>

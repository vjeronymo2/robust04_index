			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Cajnice, 7 Apr (TANJUG) -- After the seven-day  Muslim offensive on the Gorazde battlefield was completely  crushed, units of the Herzegovina Corps [of the Srpska army]  launched a counterattack which began on Tuesday afternoon and  penetrated deep into Muslim territory. Last night they reached  the river Drina near Vitkovici, 4 kilometers south of Gorazde.    According to a statement of the command of the united Serb  forces, the last Muslim units are being driven out of the  Oglecevo area, which consists of a dozen villages, and it is  only a question of time before the area is completely liberated.    "The continuing operation in the Cajnice-Foca-Gorazde  triangle is of immense importance for the people in that area  because it creates conditions for the Serbs to achieve their  centuries-old right to live on the river Drina," Colonel Nikola  Segrt, member of the command of the united Serb forces, said  this morning.    Following a brief lull last night, fierce infantry and  artillery battles resumed today in almost all sections of the  Gorazde front. In the fighting yesterday, one Herzegovina corps  fighter, Miodrag Budjen from Trebinje, was killed and four  members of the Serb forces were wounded.    According to the command of the joint Serb units, over 50  members of the forces loyal to Alija Izetbegovic were killed in  the battles yesterday; 12 bodies were found in the vicinity of  Uhotica Brdo alone.    According to Serb fighters, cries of women and children were  heard overnight from Vitkovici. It is believed that the Muslims  are in the process of liquidating the remaining Serbs from  Gorzade or are forcing them to serve as a shield in their  onslaughts on the Herzegovina corps positions.

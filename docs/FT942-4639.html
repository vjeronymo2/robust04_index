			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / EU poll issues that have guided Twelve campaigns: Germany Voting Sunday. On the issues of political and economic union, the main German government and opposition parties share many views. They favour strengthening European institutions, including giving more power to the European parliament to counter-balance the council of ministers. They want to reinforce common foreign and security policy, and more common action on crime-fighting and immigration. All agree on the need for eventual enlargement to bring the democracies of central and eastern Europe into the EU. However, the opposition Social Democrats say this can only happen after further reform within the Union - not least to bring agricultural spending under control. They argue for 'deepening' before further 'widening' of the EU. On monetary union, the parties say the economic convergence criteria are more important than the precise timetable. On social policy, the differences are clearest. The SPD favours Europe-wide social standards. The Christian Democrats stand for minimum standards of protection, without excessive regulation. The Free Democrats tend towards deregulation to improve labour market flexibility. LIKELY RESULT: The latest opinion poll, published by Focus magazine, shows the SPD and CDU neck-and-neck on 38.5 per cent, with the FDP failing to make the 5 per cent needed for seats in the parliament.</p>

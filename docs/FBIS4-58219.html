			<p>BFN     [Text] In Copenhagen, senior Israeli and Palestinian  officials this afternoon signed a mandate for an unarmed  international observer force in Hebron. Representatives from  Norway, Denmark, and Italy are due to arrive in Israel on  Thursday [5 May], and they will be stationed in Hebron by  Sunday. The document was signed by Yohanan Bein, the Foreign  Ministry's deputy director general, and Zuhdi al-Tarzi, a  foreign policy adviser to Yasir 'Arafat. Bein, talking to  No'omi Segal about the observers responsibilities:    [Begin recording] [Bein] Their job is exactly defined, and  that is to help promote stability and an appropriate environment  conducive to the enhancement of the well-being of the  Palestinians in Hebron and their economic development; and to  monitor the efforts to restore safety of the Palestinians and  events effecting it, and the return to normal life in the city  of Hebron.    [Segal] Will the observers be armed?    [Bein] No, they will not be armed, although in the original  agreement they may be armed with pistols for their self-defense.  But it was agreed among the three participating countries --  Norway, Denmark, and Italy -- that they do not want to be armed.    [Segal] What is Israel's response to that? Do security  forces feel that in addition to being responsible for the  security of Jewish and Palestinian residents of Hebron, they  will now also have to be responsible for the observers?    [Bein] Well, there is no question about it that the only  ones responsible for any security aspect in the area is Israel.  That is very clear, we are there and the Civil Administration  and the military authorities are responsible for security. But  these countries feel that those observers walking around with  white uniforms and with arm bands and in cars which are clearly  marked, they will be safer without pistols than with pistols.    [Segal] How can their presence deter any kind of clashes  between Jewish settlers and Palestinians there? Do you have any  assurances that those sides will respect their presence and that  they will be a factor in preventing any kind of clashes?    [Bein] Well, their presence cannot prevent clashes. For  that there are security forces there, and they are going to  prevent it. What they are going to do is to report on any  incident, and that's the only job of an observer. He reports,  he doesn't interfere. Mainly the Palestinians, but we too,  believe that the very presence of some observers, and clearly  when they are with a white uniform, standing there with  binoculars, and maybe with a camera, and writing down the  details, the very presence of people like this in the area might  induce tranquility.

			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / World Bank lends less to developing countries The World Bank's lending commitments to developing countries in the year to June fell from Dollars 23.7bn to Dollars 20.8bn (Pounds 13.6bn), the lowest figure for three years. Disbursements were also down sharply, the bank's operational results show, falling to Dollars 15.9bn against Dollars 18bn the year before. The biggest fall was at the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the bank's main component which lends at close to market terms, where loan commitments amounted to Dollars 14.2bn against Dollars 16.9bn the year before. Commitments by the International Development Association, which lends to the poorest countries at concessional rates, dipped to Dollars 6.6bn from Dollars 6.8bn. Bank officials attributed the decline in IBRD lending to the increased availability of private capital to developing countries. This has contributed to a sharp drop in adjustment lending as countries have not required the balance of payments support from the bank that has normally accompanied reform programmes. More funds have also been available from the regional development banks following replenishment of their resources, the officials said. Within the totals, the level of IBRD and IDA lending commitments to Africa was unchanged at Dollars 2.8bn. The bank said it was extending support for economic reform and protection of social services targeted at the poor in francophone Africa, in the wake of the devaluation by the CFA franc zone. East Asian and Pacific countries saw an increase in commitments to Dollars 6bn from Dollars 4.4bn. The four sectors in the region receiving the most support were transport, agriculture, power and education, the bank said, with an emphasis on sustainable development. Commitments to Latin America fell to Dollars 4.7bn from Dollars 5.8bn as many counties moved beyond the need for large structural adjustment loans. South Asia also got less, with commitments dropping to Dollars 2.4bn from Dollars 3.4bn. The bank noted that India had continued its economic reform programme and strengthened its foreign exchange programme and no longer required loans to pay for its imports. George Graham adds: The Republic of Congo has paid up all of its Dollars 101m in arrears to the World Bank and the IDA. Congo had been more than six months overdue on its payments to the World Bank since 1991. By clearing its arrears, Congo becomes eligible for new bank loans.</p>

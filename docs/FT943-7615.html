			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / International Company News: Wal-Mart to open outlets in Hong Kong Wal-Mart Stores, the US discount store group and the world's biggest retailer, its planning to expand into Asia by opening stores in Hong Kong and China. The company says it will carry out the expansion through a joint venture agreement with Ek Chor Distribution System, a Hong Kong company owned by Charoen Pokphand, the multinational conglomerate and Thailand's biggest business group. The joint venture expects to start by opening three or four Value Clubs in Hong Kong this autumn. At between 10,000 sq ft and 20,000 sq ft per store, the Value Clubs will be a smaller version of Wal-Mart's membership warehouse clubs, which operate as Sam's Clubs in the US. Later, the joint venture plans to enter mainland China with discount stores and membership warehouse clubs similar to Wal-Mart's US discount stores and Sam's Clubs. The move into Asia marks a significant departure for Wal-Mart, as it is the company's first move outside the Americas, where it has 2,091 Wal-Mart discount stores, 87 Supercenters (discount stores and supermarkets combined), and 434 Sam's Clubs. The company began its expansion outside the US in 1991, when it signed a joint venture agreement with Cifra, Mexico's largest retailer. In March this year it acquired 122 Woolco discount stores in Canada from Woolworth, the US retailer, and started converting them to the Wal-Mart format. Also in March, Wal-Mart established its first Asian links when it signed a deal with Ito-Yokado, the Japanese supermarket chain, to start supplying its own-brand products to the Japanese retailer. With the US retail market suffering from saturation, Wal-Mart has gone the way of other large US retailing groups, which are tending to look outside their domestic market for growth.</p>

			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Larger customer base lifts SW Water A rise in the number of new customers helped South West Water, the privatised utility, to announce a 3 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 50.3m. The outcome, largely in line with expectation, was struck on sales up 30 per cent to Pounds 125.7m for the six months to September 30. The increase in profits was due to a strong performance in the core regulated water and sewage business, which benefited from the addition of 2,500 new customers, cost savings and price increases. Mr Ken Hill, finance director, said the group had returned 'good sound results' in the first half. Operating profits were 32 per cent higher at Pounds 54.9m, helped by a Pounds 1m contribution from the non-core businesses. The pre-tax return increased at a slower rate due to interest charges of Pounds 4.8m, against gains last year of Pounds 7.6m. South West, which received a Pounds 266m dowry from the government at flotation to help pay for its substantial capital expenditure programme, is expected to have gearing of between 25 per cent and 30 per cent by the year end. The non-core business moved ahead on the back of three acquisitions. These accounted for about half of the increase in group sales. Two of the three businesses were profitable after interest costs. The third, Haul Waste, incurred losses of less than Pounds 1m after interest. The interim dividend is raised by 7.7 per cent to 8.4p. Earnings per share were 3.5 per cent higher at 38.4p. COMMENT South West is about one third the way through its disproportionately large capital expenditure programme and has another Pounds 1.3bn which it must spend. Although so far it has been allowed substantially higher price increases than its colleagues to fund the expenditure, this status may well come under pressure in next year's review. Furthermore, even though South West has been pretty acute in spotting cost cutting opportunities, these may be increasingly more difficult to achieve in future. Forecasts for full year profits of Pounds 95m give a prospective p/e of 8. The company's main attraction seems to be its yield which stands out in an otherwise dull sector.</p>

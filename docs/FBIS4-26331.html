			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By special reporter Ching Chi (5428 2765): "Beijing </F> Recruits College Graduates To Replenish Police, Which Are of  Poor Quality and Short-Handed"]    [Text] At present, graduates from the public security  schools and colleges in the mainland can hardly meet the needs  of the police service in all localities. The poor quality of  the police force, which is also short-handed, has become one of  the major reasons for the failure to effectively contain crime.  This year, the public security departments of Beijing and some  other big cities, for the first time, will recruit police  officers openly in society, and this will meet with a positive  response from graduates of colleges and secondary vocational  schools.    At a recent job orientation meeting for 1994 college and  secondary vocational school graduates in Beijing, the Beijing  Municipal Public Security Bureau, for the first time, openly  recruited a number of policemen and policewomen from among  applicants in society. Beyond many people's expectations, many  college graduates showed interest in joining the police force.  At the meeting, some 2,500 college and secondary vocational  school graduates made inquiries, and 870 people -- including 440  female college students -- filled in forms to show their  interest.    The practice of the police in Beijing showed that they were  in need of competent personnel, and police in all parts of the  country also face the same situation. According to statistics,  the proportion of policemen and public security personnel to the  national population now is greatly lower than in other  countries. In particular, a large part of the police force in  China is the armed police force, responsible for domestic  security, and the proportion of the police force directly used  to manage public order and check crimes is even smaller. In  addition, the police force is prominently short of officers who  know foreign languages and have mastered modern skills in police  work.    In Beijing, the number of policemen and the proportion of  the  police troops to the local population are slightly higher than  in other provinces and municipalities, but the police force in  Beijing shoulders much heavier tasks than its counterparts in  other localities. They not only have to maintain law and order  in the capital and guarantee the security of major conferences,  important visitors, and large cultural and sports events, but  also have to guarantee the safety of foreign visitors. The  image of the police in Beijing also reflects, to a certain  degree, the image of the nation. Therefore, in addition to  replenishing the police force in Beijing, the overall quality of  the police force there also must be enhanced so that it can  match Beijing's status.    According to statistics, however, only 14 percent of the  policemen and policewomen in Beijing are college or secondary  vocational school graduates, and the percentage is six points  lower then the national average. As Beijing now is becoming a  modern international metropolis, this quality of the police  force often causes embarrassment to the capital city. When some  foreigners want to seek help from policemen, this may embarrass  most policemen, who even do not know the simplest English words.  In addition, the police force now still cannot proficiently  operate the modern communications system, make scientific  arrangements, and carry out effective management. A modern  metropolis needs a high-quality guardian.    The responsible officials of the Public Security Ministry  also are clearly aware of the hidden crisis in the quality of  the police force. Zhu Chunlin, deputy director of the Political  Department of the Public Security Ministry, said that it is  necessary to enhance and improve the overall educational  background and structure of the public security personnel and  police officers. In particular, in order to modernize the means  of public security, it is urgently necessary to recruit people  who have received better education. The proportion of college  graduates in the police force, especially that in Beijing, will  be getting larger. The general educational condition of the  police also will be raised.    At present, however, the public security schools in all  parts  of the country still cannot provide sufficient graduates to meet  the needs of the police department. On the other hand, the  educational background of the policemen and policewomen  recruited openly in society remains at a comparatively low  level, and the recruits must first receive a certain amount of  training. Therefore, police recruitment must be linked with the  competitive job market in order to attract more competent  personnel, and should be opened to college graduates first.  However, it is still unknown how many college students will  have an interest in joining the police force.    This time, the job orientation meeting for the college  graduates in Beijing brought unexpected gratification to the  police in Mainland China. Applicants on that occasion included  college graduates majoring in 63 branches of learning, including  law, Chinese language, computer science, and foreign languages.  There also were doctorate candidates, postgraduate students for  master's degree courses, and college graduates holding double  bachelor degrees. As the police recruitment action also was  opened to females, this attracted a large number of female  college students.</p>

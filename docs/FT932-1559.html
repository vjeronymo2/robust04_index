			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Personal View: An antidote to financial distress Against a back-ground of profound changes in recent years in the scope and nature of government involvement in economic activities, the idea of a partnership between government, banking and business to help stimulate economic recovery is gaining increasing attention. Such a partnership was recently advocated by Brian Pearse, Midland Bank chief executive (Personal View, May 14), as being capable of addressing three key areas where financial distress is most likely to affect small enterprises. These were their overdependence on short-term, fickle and often expensive liabilities, the shortage of equity funds and long-term debt, and their vulnerable cash flows. This idea of a partnership, in the grey area where there is still scope for private initiative and public involvement to come closely together, echoes one of the themes debated at the meeting of European heads of state in Edinburgh last December. On that occasion, there was a unanimous recognition both of the need to alleviate the impact of the recession on small businesses and of the fact that this would be more efficiently and economically achieved through a pooling of public and private initiatives and resources. As a consequence, on top of temporary measures designed to stimulate economic growth, it was decided to create the European Investment Fund (EIF), an alliance among Europe's banks, the European Commission and the European Investment Bank (EIB). Initially, the main activity of the EIF will be to provide loan guarantees both to European small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and to trans-European networks projects, the latter mostly in the fields of telecommunications, transport and energy. At a later stage, the interventions of the EIF may be extended to include equity finance. The initial subscribed capital of the EIF will be Ecu2bn (about Pounds 1.6bn at current exchange rates), of which 30 per cent is to be supplied by European banks, 30 per cent by the Commission and 40 per cent by the EIB. The amounts of investments and commitments the EIF can take on could eventually be as much as eight times its subscribed capital, or some Pounds 12.8bn worth of guarantees and investments. The EIF's activities will be conducted entirely on the basis of market principles, and will include the duty to seek an adequate remuneration to the capital employed by its shareholders. The necessary preparatory work is well under way, and we hope to start operations by year-end. Though not the first attempt at marrying private financial institutions with public agencies (a few similar cases have successfully been implemented in the US in the field of mortgage guarantees for residential housing), it is nonetheless an innovation in the European financial landscape. The expectation is that it could go some way towards alleviating two enduring market 'failures', or 'market needs'. The first of these market failures is the lack of long-term guarantee mechanisms capable of drawing sufficient private funds to the infrastructure projects so vital to a well-functioning European single market. This will be the main area of activity of the EIF, at least in its initial phase. There are two main objectives. One will be to facilitate an increased involvement of traditional providers of funds, such as banks, by reducing their capital requirements or transferring risk exposures. The other will be to attract new investors by relieving them of certain types of project risks or by adding liquidity to the financial claims backing infrastructure projects. Either way, the intervention of the EIF would aim at enhancing existing market mechanisms and widening the pool of funds directed at these projects. The second market need that the EIF will try to address is the thin and often highly volatile flow of long-term debt and equity funds to Europe's small companies, a key component of the Community's productive sector. Here, the EIF would complement the existing public loan guarantee schemes and other market mechanisms by offering loan guarantees to financing facilities which support investments by SMEs. It would thereby ease smaller companies' access to long-term finance, and make available better and cheaper terms and conditions. To pick up Brian Pearse's theme again, the EIF will represent exactly the kind of co-operative action between government, banks and businesses that he advocates. In taking it forward, the EC member states and the founding members of the EIF will aim to help get Europe's economies back on their feet and make them better able to respond to the competitive challenges of increasingly open world markets.

			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Observer: Relocation Talk about charity beginning at home. Yesterday's Independent illustrated its report on the restored dividend at estate agents Savills with a picture of a country house. The caption read: ' . . . Lower Roundhurst near Hazelmere, Lancashire, is priced at Pounds 1.8m.' What wasn't mentioned was that the property belongs to one of the Indy's columnists who'll no doubt welcome the publicity for the sale - share-tipster Jim Slater. Even so, the paper stopped short of putting potential buyers directly on the scent. The house is not in Hazelmere, Lancashire, but Haslemere, Surrey.</p>

			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / International Company News: United Airlines' unions in offer THE THREE biggest unions at United Airlines, one of the largest US carriers, yesterday said they intended to offer the company a package which would cut employee costs significantly in exchange for a substantial equity stake in the company. The carrier said yesterday it 'will be in a position to respond after receiving and evaluating a direct and specific communication' from the coalition. The proposed offer from the pilots, flight attendants and machinists has strong parallels with a scheme at Northwest Airlines, where the main unions are negotiating to help the carrier save nearly Dollars 900m and avert a bankruptcy filing. Under the terms of an agreement with the pilots' union, employees at Northwest will have the option of being repaid for their concessions within 10 years of receiving as much as 37.5 per cent of the company's common stock. Similarly, unions at TWA, which hopes to emerge from Chapter 11 later this summer, have made big concessions in exchange for a large equity stake in the reorganised airline. The coalition of United's unions said its proposal would include significant employee participation in the governance of the carrier. It would also consider a new competitive action plan which would help United respond aggressively to the challenges now facing the airline industry. United's unions have attempted to gain control of the carrier four times since 1987, including a Dollars 4.38bn buy-out bid by pilots in 1990. Although the terms of the latest proposal have not been finalised, it is unlikely to be structured as a leveraged buy-out. The coalition has not specified the size of the equity stake it would request from the company, nor did it specify expected labour cost savings. UAL, United's parent com pany, recently said it would make deeper than expected capacity cuts on its US routes in reaction to grim industry conditions. It also warned that overseas growth would be more modest than planned. In January, the Chicago-based company said it hoped to cut annual costs by around Dollars 400m by axeing 2,800 jobs and not going ahead with plans to hire 1,900 people this year. Mr Stephen Wolf, United chairman, warned that the 'fundamental flaws in our industry are still pervasive and threaten our long-term financial health'. Some analysts suggested that yesterday's announcement was a sign that the unions recognise pressure in the airline industry and might be willing to negotiate.</p>

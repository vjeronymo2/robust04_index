This comes about in the  wake of the Cairo talks and the deliberations which took place  at the prime minister's bureau today. Our political  correspondent Shlomo Raz reports that the first stage reference  is to policemen who will have no enforcement powers, but will  come to study the area. According to the agreement that is being  consolidated, the Palestinian policemen in Hebron will supervise  facilities, including the town hall and the university. Israeli  forces and the Palestinian police will also conduct joint  patrols, under Israeli command.    As for the Norwegian observers, it has been reported that  Israel demands that they number between 50 and 60, while the  Palestinians want to have about 150. Our correspondent adds  that the negotiations which will resume in Cairo on Tuesday are  slated to end by 12 April.    According to plans, the agreement will be signed by Prime  Minister Rabin and PLO leader 'Arafat. Further meetings between  'Arafat and Foreign Minister Peres may take place before the  signing.    The prime minister will hold another discussion early next  week, prior to the resumption of the Cairo talks on Tuesday.</p>

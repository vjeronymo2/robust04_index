			<p><P> February 28, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> STILL IN CRITICAL CONDITION  </P> <P> The shuffling at Cal State Fullerton has been going on for some time, as the  athletic department works to correct inequities between men's and women's  sports at the school.  </P> <P> The women's basketball program and the women's softball program have moved from  cramped offices into larger ones.  </P> <P> Maryalyce Jeremiah, the women's basketball coach, now drives a courtesy car, as  does men's basketball coach John Sneed.  </P> <P> But the critical issue at Fullerton, as usual, is money. The success of  Fullerton's well-intentioned efforts to improve its support for women's  programs will be difficult to judge until late this week, when the university's  Athletics Council is expected to approve a budget recommendation to be  submitted to University President Jewel Plummer Cobb for her approval.  </P> <P> The challenge is to find a way to add $145,000 to the budgets of women's sports  in an athletic program that already reaches a financial crisis point almost  every year.  </P> <P> This year, the department has a deficit of $236,000, and has responded with  actions as serious as a staff salary cuts.  </P> <P> Cobb has pledged her support to the additional funding for the women's  programs. In order to reach a workable budget for next year, it may require  cutting as many as three sports from Fullerton's 17-sport program, school  officials have said. Football is not being considered.  </P> <P> And although a department report says it is not "a wise solution" to take money  from already minimal men's budgets to resolve the situation, that seems very  likely to happen.  </P> <P> That, in turn, could create another sort of inequity. Fullerton might find that  its women's sports are funded competitively with the schools they compete  against, while the men's programs compete against programs that operate on much  larger budgets.  </P> <P> The figure of $145,000 is from a department study that was undertaken at the  urging of a group of women's coaches. That study showed that Fullerton was not  in compliance with Title IX, the federal law that prohibits sex discrimination  in education and requires spending for women's programs to be proportional to  the number of women participants.  </P> <P> For Fullerton to be in compliance, thereby avoiding the potential for a  lawsuit, the women's budget must be 31% of the total, the approximate  percentage of women to men athletes at the school, according to the study.  </P> <P> The additional money might mean marked changes in the women's programs.  </P> <P> In the past, some men's teams flew to Northern California, but comparable  women's teams traveled by bus or van. Recruiting budgets for men's sports have  been eight times greater than women's recruiting budgets. In basketball, the  men's recruiting budget has been 20 times the women's.  </P> <P> At the same time, coaching salaries in women's sports at Fullerton are among  the highest in the nation. The full-time women's coaches -- Jeremiah, softball  coach Judi Garman and gymnastics' Lynn Rogers -- each make about $65,000, the  same as Sneed, the men's basketball coach. Gene Murphy, the football coach, is  paid $65,000 plus an unspecified supplement.  </P> <P> The women's coaches who have sought additional funding have sought only what is  already guaranteed by law. How the athletic department responds to the budget  crisis created by that request won't be known until a final budget is  submitted.  </P> <P> Leanne Grotke, associate athletic director, said the department is proud of its  efforts to achieve equity, saying Fullerton had not been "seriously  discriminatory" in any practices and is implementing standards more rigid than  those required by law.  </P> <P> Football Coach Gene Murphy has been given the go-ahead to hire two assistants,  bringing his staff back to the NCAA standard of nine by the beginning of spring  practice, Athletic Director Ed Carroll said.  </P> <P> Fullerton lost two assistants in recent weeks. Ed Donatell resigned to take an  assistant's job with the New York Jets last week, and Preston Dennard said he  lost his position because of budget problems.  </P> <P> Carroll would not comment on both coaches being replaced in spite of the budget  problems, but speculation is that the two positions will be filled at a lower  salary level.  </P> <P> Heavyweight wrestler David Jones is getting better. Coach Dan Lewis is certain  of it.  </P> <P> "Fortunately or unfortunately, I can tell," Lewis said. "I'm his workout  partner."  </P> <P> Jones, ranked ninth in the nation by Amateur Wrestling News, is expected to  qualify for the NCAA championships March 22-24 at College Park, Md.  </P> <P> "The way he's been wrestling lately, he could win the nationals," Lewis said.  </P> <P> Jones is back in form again after missing several weeks of the season with a  kidney problem. He was held out of wrestling as a precautionary measure on a  doctor's advice, but was cleared to participate after consulting a specialist.  </P> <P> "Since then, he's been training real hard," Lewis said.  </P> <P> The baseball team warmed up for the Big West Conference season with a 16-2  exhibition victory Monday over Waseda University, the Japanese collegiate  champion.  </P> <P> Fullerton, concerned about its offense during the preseason, had 23 hits in the  game, including two home runs by Phil Nevin, who had hit two against U.S.  International Saturday.  </P> <P> The Titans have had at least 10 hits in their past nine games going into a  weekend series against the University of the Pacific.  </P> <P> Titan Notes  </P> <P> The wrestling team was forced to forfeit its final match of the regular season  to Cal Poly San Luis Obispo after the NCAA ruled the Titans had broken a rule  by practicing with another team. Fullerton held practices with Minnesota for  two days in January following a meet with Minnesota. Although Coach Dan Lewis  said NCAA rules do not explicitly prohibit joint practices, Lewis said the  sessions were ruled to be scrimmages, thus violating a rule that limits the  number of scrimmages and matches. . . .  </P></p>

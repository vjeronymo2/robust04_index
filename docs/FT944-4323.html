			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / International Company News: SBC begins SFr121m rescue of canton bank Swiss Bank Corporation, Switzerland's third largest bank, today begins an agreed SFr121m (Dollars 16.1m) rescue takeover bid for Solothurner Kantonalbank, the first Swiss cantonal bank to be fully privatised. The way for the bid was cleared on Sunday when a majority of the voters of the canton of Solothurn supported privatisation rather than face the uncertain costs of restoring the bank to health. Other cantons are expected to follow the Solothurn example, as competition in Swiss banking intensifies. The bank's SFr170m share capital, entirely owned by the cantonal government, is being completely written off. SBC, however, is paying a net SFr113m for goodwill. Holders of the 400,000 dividend participation certificates issued to the public in 1987 at SFr220, and in 1989 at SFr200, are being offered SFr20 in cash for each certificate, or a two-year option worth SFr22 to buy SBC registered shares. SBC is also offering each certificate-holder the right to open a savings account up to SFr50,000 in the successor bank, to be known as Solothurner Bank. These accounts will carry an interest rate 1 per cent above that on a senior citizen's account for two years. SBC estimates the value of this offer at SFr70 per certificate. Solothurner Kantonalbank has SFr1.2bn in uncertain loans, against which it has SFr475m in provisions. The canton has agreed to pay SFr34m towards interest provisions in 1996 and in 1997, and then guarantee a further SFr125m after 1998. Its overall guarantee on the bank's affairs will stand until the end of 1996, or until the expiry of existing term deposits. SBC will operate the new bank, with its 22 branches and 460 employees, separately from its own retail network.</p>

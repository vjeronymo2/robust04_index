			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Letter: Engineering job cuts are those Britain cannot afford to make Sir, On Wednesday, February 12 1992, British Aerospace announced 2,350 redundancies - 900 in the regional aircraft company and 1,450 in military aircraft. Redundancies of that amount are always significant, particularly in Britain's largest manufacturer and exporter. What was even more significant, however, was that about 70 per cent were managerial and technical staff, including about 1,000 professional engineers. The trend in recent redundancy announcements in high-tech manufacturing is for white-collar job losses to outnumber those of manual workers. While any job lost is a tragedy for the employee concerned, the type of jobs now being cut are those which neither the employer nor the national economy can afford to lose. It was only a short time ago that companies like BAe, Rolls-Royce, GEC and British Nuclear Fuels were scouring the universities and polytechnics of Britain, promising bright, long-term careers for engineering graduates. Now they are sacking them in large numbers. It is a well-publicised fact that Britain has a shortage of qualified engineers; it should not be thought, however, that those displaced will readily find alternative work. Geographical factors, family, lack of retraining opportunities and, above all, the UK recession, make it extremely unlikely that other jobs will be available. It is certain that many of the new unemployed will be sceptical of Britain's engineering future and will look for other career paths. Some will drift into casual types of work merely to have an income. In towns around the manufacturing sites, Britain may be able to boast some of the best educated and qualified mini-cab drivers who were previously professional engineers. One of the latest absurdities to emanate from Michael Howard, Secretary of State for Employment, is that employees should be required to repay the cost of training if they move to another employer. What message would he have for the highly skilled employees of BAe who have sacrificed time and money to achieve professional qualifications, only to be dumped into the ever larger pool of the unemployed? The government believes that random market forces will resolve the problems but they cannot and will not. We elect governments to manage the economy. This government stands on the sidelines wringing its hands and reciting incantations about worldwide recession, recovery just around the corner and that it would be worse under Labour. How much worse can it get? Tim Webb, national officer, MSF, Park House, 64-66 Wandsworth Common North Side, London SW18 2SH</p>

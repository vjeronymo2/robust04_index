			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / International Company News: Israelis open tender for bank sale Israel yesterday opened the tender for the sale of 20 to 40 per cent of the shares in Bank Leumi, the country's second-largest banking group, marking a critical turning point in the government's plans to sell off the banks. The move came as four international and local consortia met a government deadline to submit plans to participate in the sale of United Mizrahi Bank. MI Holdings, the Israeli body charged with selling off the country's banks which were taken into public ownership after a share manipulation scandal in 1983,said local and foreign investors interested in buying Bank Leumi would have to submit proposals by the middle of April and deposit Dollars 20m. In 1992, Bank Leumi reported consolidated net profits of Dollars 76m from total consolidated assets of Dollars 28bn. Last year the government began selling off shares in Leumi and other banks. The government still owns 73 per cent of the shares, with the publicand Leumi employees holding almost 23 per cent and the original owners, the Jewish Colonial Trust, almost 5 per cent. The government says it welcomes bids from single investors, holding groups and foreign banks and will follow the Leumi offer with the sale of a controlling stake in Bank Hapoalim, the country's largest bank. The investors will have to be approved by banking authorities in the US, UK, Switzerland and other countries in which Leumi has operations. In the Mizrahi sale, four groups are bidding to buy between 25.1 and 51 per cent of the share in a sale expected to be completed by April. The leading group isbelieved to be the La Nationale Insurance consortium which includes prominent Israeli businessmen, a Swiss bank and Swiss mutual fund and Israel Aircraft Industries. In 1992 Mizrahi reported profits of Dollars 40m.</p>

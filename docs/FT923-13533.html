			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Tube extension plan to be revived LONDON Underground is to revive plans to double the length of the East London line by extending it at surface level northwards to Highbury and Islington and southwards to East Dulwich. This autumn it will seek government permission to build the extensions at a cost of Pounds 100m. It hopes at least some of the cost will be met with contributions from the private sector, local authorities and the government. London Underground wants to extend the East London line to take it into areas at present badly served by public transport. A longer line would also help to regenerate some of London's less well-off inner-city areas. The scheme is said to offer exceptional value for money because nearly all of it can be carried out by using existing railway alignments, either derelict or in use. It would involve almost no property demolition. London Underground last sought permission to build the extensions at a cost of Pounds 121m two years ago when the developers of the former Bishopsgate goods yard offered to contribute Pounds 50m towards the scheme. In return, the developers wanted a station next to their planned development. This time London Underground is going it alone with a cheaper scheme. If permission is given, London Underground hopes to start construction in 1994 and open the first stage northwards to Dalston in 1996. The other stages would follow over the next year and a half. Mr Denis Tunnicliffe, managing director of London Underground, emphasised that the project was not a substitute for the planned extension of the Jubilee line, at present blocked by the private sector's failure to deliver a promised contribution towards the construction cost.</p>

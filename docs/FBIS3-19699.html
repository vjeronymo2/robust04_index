The financial subsidies from Bonn that  had been applied for and approved arrived much too late for its  startup. Not until the 800,000 German marks [DM] finally arrived  were the company founders able to decisively increase the tempo  of expansion, according to Friedrich Luecking, Parsytec's  marketing chief. Today, the manufacturer of parallel computers  has 150 employees and--only eight years after startup--sales of  nearly DM30 million. Sales specialist Luecking is certain that  without government money "we would not have achieved such rapid  growth." Other financiers--such as the big banks--kept aloof. At  the time, only the Aachen City Savings Bank granted the founders  of the enterprise a loan.    The experience of the Aachen electronics tinkerers is not an  exception. Whoever has ideas but no capital and wants to  establish a company in Germany has a rough time of it. Private  financiers are a scarce commodity, banks insist on collateral,  and government grants are to be landed--if at all--only after  nerve-deadening struggles with forms and long waiting periods.  It is understandable that Erich Haeusser, head of the German  Patent Office, laments: "No one in Germany really risks capital  for innovations." If, in the management suites of industry and  the banks, the people with reservations continue to maintain the  upper hand, according to the top guardian of patents, "German  business and industry will be throwing jobs away."    To date, it has been primarily too costly workers, sleepy  managers, and regulation-crazy politicians that have been held  responsible for Germany's malaise as a location for business and  industry. On the other hand, it was not only Mannheim economics  professor Wolfgang Buehler who consistently included the banking  system among the "assets" of Germany as a place to do business.  No wonder: The German financial houses have remained spared of  crises such as the savings and loan scandal in the United States  or the real estate debacle in Japan. Even during the deepest  recession the major banks in Frankfurt have achieved record  profits--proof for Manfred Weber, general executive manager of  the National Association of German Banks, of the "stabilizing  effect" of the universal banking system. Because German credit  institutions are permitted to engage in all types of financial  business and are allowed to accumulate undisclosed reserves  almost at will, they can consistently show profits.    But Ingo Walter, a professor at New York University and at  INSEAD [European Business Management Institute] in Fontainbleau,  believes that it is often the case that "success is a sign of  failure" because "great stability" has a reverse side to it--"a  lack of growth." The cost to the German economy, according to  bank expert Walter: "too high capital costs" and "too little  receptivity to innovation." The close relationship between  credit management and industry--resulting from links to house  banks, equity interests, and directorships--that once made the  economic miracle possible, is now increasingly acting as a brake  on growth. Dieter Wolf, head of the Cartel Office, also lamented  during the latest hearings before the Economics Committee of the  Bundestag on the subject of "the power of the banks" that the  strong influence of the banks "has a tendency" to act in a way  that is "inimical to innovation."    Germany's managers have thus far not been heard uttering  such  sharp criticism--no one would like to ruin things with his house  bank during a recession. Yet when the Munich IFO Institute  [Institute for Economic Research] was commissioned by  WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE to sound out 702 companies, the managers, under  the protection of anonymity, dispensed with their reserve: Some  59 percent complain about too little competition among German  banks and 63 percent regard their willingness to undertake risk  to be too low when compared to international standards.    New York expert Walters believes that, in contrast to the  Americans, the British, and even the French, the Germans have  apparently not grasped the "principle of diversification"--harsh  criticism since, after all, every economics student today learns  portfolio theory that teaches that a combination of speculative  investments can entail lower overall risk than the respective  individual risks. Yet the Germans, bank researcher Walter  observes, are still always looking at things on  project-by-project basis rather than looking at entire  portfolios. The unfortunate consequences: There is too little  risk capital for innovation and establishing new companies.    For all that, it looked in the 1980's as if the banks were  awakening from their lethargy. Under the sponsorship of  financially strong institutes, holding companies were springing  up everywhere. The successes in California's Silicon Valley  invited imitation: The average return on capital of American  venture capital companies reached 20 percent. The Germans tasted  blood and from 1982 through 1987 the volume of investments grew  from DM785 million to just under DM1.6 billion. When quick  success was not forthcoming, things went downhill again. Instead  of investing in risky, innovative projects, the holding  companies preferred to buy into established medium to  small-sized companies. Holger Frommann, managing director of the  National Association of German Financial Investment Companies,  does not like to use the terms "venture capital" or "risk  capital" any more because of their "negative sound." True  venture financing, according to Hans-Joachim Hass, chief of the  Economic Policy Department at the BDI [Federal Association of  German Industry], "hardly exists any more."    The extreme aversion to risk on the part of German banks has  proven to be particularly unfortunate for reconstruction in  eastern Germany. It helps little that Federal Chancellor Kohl  repeatedly makes a personal appeal for the promised "bank  billions." Bad consequences of the lack of risk capital: Most  east German inventors and companies are facing the threat of  losing their patent rights. Only 18 percent of former GDR  patents had acquired full legal patent protection by the end of  1992; the Patent Office estimates that about 50 percent of them  are usable, however, yet the money is only sufficient for the  registration of individual inventions. Consequence: For  companies, the innovative potential is lost.    Whether in the east or the west--there is enough money,  complains Klaus Bregger, chairman of the Christian Democratic  Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] Association of Small  Businessmen, but it is just "being put in the wrong place." The  big banks have given "the cold shoulder" often enough to the  founders of software companies and biolabs: "The banks are  lacking in expertise and intuition."    The conservative predominance of the established money  houses  has created a climate that leaves little room for venture  capital. For the minority of risk-loving investors in Germany  there are few opportunities to invest in expanding companies  because young firms are a scarce commodity on the stock  market--underwriting is handled almost exclusively by the banks  and their creditworthiness requirements are far more stringent  than the legal regulations. Whereas more than 800 firms were  launched on Wall Street last year, precisely nine new companies  made it to the stock market in Germany.    Whether the Bonn government's plans for the registration of  a  "small joint stock company" can make a decisive difference  remains yet to be seen. No doubt about it: The German equity  market is underdeveloped and, in addition to restrictive  regulations and fearful investors, it is the leisurely banks  that are primarily responsible for it. Moreover, for a long time  foreign investors were not enthusiastic about Siemens,  Daimler-Benz, or Mannesmann stock because, in contrast to the  Anglo-Saxon world, the financial markets hardly play a role in  the control of companies in Germany.    Unimpressed by short-term capers, members of the board of  directors from banks and friendly companies saw to the  reconciliation of interests among workers, managers, and  shareholders. Yet what for a long time had been a "mainstay,"  the British magazine ECONOMIST groused, is now developing into a  "burden" because the conflicts of interest are becoming  critical--the conflict between the desire of employees for  lifelong employment and that of shareholders for better return  on capital, for example.    According to American professor Walter, the scandal  surrounding the metal company [as published] causes doubts about  the German system to continue to grow. The very thing happened  in that case that bank participation on boards of directors was  supposed to prevent: "The theory was good but the practice of it  was not very successful." The New York economist hopes that the  affair of the metal company could--certainly in a way similar to  that of the insider scandal involving IG Metall [Industrial  Trade Union of Metalworkers] boss Franz Steinkuehler--initiate  reforms in the German system. The Federal Government's second  Capital Market Development Law, after all, provides for stricter  regulations concerning insiders and the establishment of an  independent regulatory authority for securities. Werner Seifert,  head of Deutsche Boersen AG [German Stock Exchanges, Inc.], is  citing the emergence of an "equity culture" in Germany. But  banking official Weber warns against "exaggerated expectations:"  "We have a long road ahead of us."    Innovative company founders can hardly muster that much  patience and the call for state intervention is thus rapidly  becoming louder among Bonn economic policy makers: The CDU wants  to create tax breaks for high-tech investors, and Jenoptik chief  Lothar Spaeth wants to entice private investors, banks, and the  government to join together in a collective innovation fund--a  proposal that makes Minister for Economics Guenter Rexrodt  shudder. He is not at all in favor of the government "jumping  into"--of all places--that most noble discipline of the free  market economy: the allocation of risk capital.    The Aachen Parsytec Company has already drawn its  conclusions  from the stunted venture capital market in Germany: It wishes to  sell shares on the stock market--not in Frankfurt or  Duesseldorf, however, but rather directly to risk-loving  investors--in the United States.</p>

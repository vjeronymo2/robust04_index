			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lima, 10 Jan (EFE) -- According to a report  published today in the Lima magazine SI, the terrorist violence  that persists in Peru is led by Oscar Ramirez Durand, alias  "Feliciano," who has rejected the leadership of Abimael Guzman,  the founder of the Maoist Shining Path who is in favor of a  peace agreement.    The rejection by Ramirez Durand of the orders of Guzman, who  is the top leader and is considered the "guiding thought" of the  terrorist organization, has led this group to a schism which is  analyzed by the political weekly publication. The report states  that while Guzman seeks to put an end to the "people's war" with  his petitions for a peace agreement with Peruvian President  Alberto Fujimori, "Feliciano" and his followers advocate a  continuation of violence.    Ramirez, who is considered the number three man of the group  after Guzman and his mistress Elena Iparraguirre -- who are both  sentenced to life imprisonment -- has become the leader of those  who follow him and who now disavow the leadership of the Shining  Path founder. According to the magazine, the dissidents today  recognize "Feliciano" as the new "president" of the Shining  Path. For them, Guzman no longer is "President Gonzalo," and he  has become "just another prisoner."    The attacks that took place in Lima during the last week of  December and the first week of January -- including the  detonation of car bombs in the Prefecture (Civil Government) of  Lima that left over 20 injured and considerable damage -- are  attributed to this radical group.    The weekly publication feels that this "recalcitrant" group  of Shining Path was formed by the union of the People's Aid of  Peru -- a Shining Path group that supported armed actions and  provided all types of assistance to the activists -- with the  Metropolitan Committee that has formed a Regional Directorate.  According to the report, this directorate would come under a  central committee that has been reorganized under the leadership  of Ramirez Durand.    The report adds that in Lima, four special detachments have  been organized by the veterans in the terrorist struggle, and  that only one of them -- the one in the eastern area of the city  -- is reportedly engaging in military actions, while the others  are conducting political activities to recruit new militants.    In October of 1993, three weeks after Abimael Guzman sent  the  first letter from prison to the Peruvian president asking him to  hold talks for a peace agreement, in more than one town of Puno  Department, southeast of Lima, there appeared signs that read:  "Viva President Feliciano."    The weekly adds that, later, in the jungle region of Tingo  Maria, a Shining Path column stopped a passenger vehicle and one  of the members told them that "Feliciano" had assumed leadership  of the organization because "Guzman is no longer President  Gonzalo, because he is a traitor to the revolutionary cause."  "We do not agree with the letter of surrender. To the  contrary, we will continue to struggle," the Shining Path member  reportedly said.    SI states that the reports show "two lines, two directions,  two currents," and that the other one is that made up of 2,500  Shining Path members, who are being held in 10 prisons in the  country. Abimael Guzman exercises control over them. It adds  that Guzman has managed to retain the loyalty of that group, due  to a project begun three months ago when the two letters in  which he asked Fujimori for peace were made public.    The magazine states that the Shining Path leader obtained  the  transfer from Yanamayo Prison (in Puno) to Lima of several  leaders, including Osman Morote, Martha Huatay, Victor Zavala,  and Maria Pantoja. Guzman instructed the imprisoned militants  at a meeting in the Naval Base where he is being held to  persuade the imprisoned members to accept the request for peace.    Shining Path members who are being held in the prisons of  Santa Monica and Canto Grande of Lima and Yanamayo Prison in  Puno have expressed support for Abimael Guzman's peace request.</p>

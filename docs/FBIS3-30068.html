			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Thailand is calling on the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade to stop linking trade issues to environmental  concerns. The deputy minister for science, technology, and  environment, Pricha Musikun, made the request at an informal  meeting on trade and the environment in Geneva, Switzerland,  attended by more than 20 nations.    The gathering was organized as a brainstorming session ahead  of the signing of the new Uruguay GATT agreement in April.  Thailand and Malaysia attended the meeting as representatives  of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN. Mr.  Pricha said developed nations should not make environmental  demands as part of any trade negotiations with developing  countries. He said it is important that all nations be allowed  to develop at their own pace.</p>

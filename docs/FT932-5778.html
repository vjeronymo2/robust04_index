			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: BAe British Aerospace's new management is developing a happy knack of delivering on its promises. The deal to sell its corporate jet business to Raytheon is just the latest step in BAe's rehabilitation. Indeed it is encouraging that through a range of deals the company stuck so closely to the development plans set out by Mr John Cahill shortly after he became chairman. That corporate jets have been sold now also underlines the new-found strength in BAe's negotiating position. Last autumn sale talks collapsed when Raytheon pushed too hard on conditions. The UK's lower exchange rate has increased the sterling price Raytheon can pay, but BAe's tough stance shows that assets will not go at fire sale prices. Of BAe's remaining businesses, the turboprop aircraft operation is likely to go into a joint venture eventually - possibly with Aerospatiale. A better tone to the property market may allow disposals which release cash, even though much of the paper profit has already been taken to offset rationalisation costs. On a larger scale the valuable Hatfield airfield may be re-developed as a business centre on the M25 with parking for the busy executive's corporate jet. Rover, however, is likely to remain within the group for some time. BAe still has to manage the net worth of its balance sheet carefully, and Rover would not fetch anything near book value yet. With the company making market share gains and a UK car market recovery in prospect, there is little reason to sell now. BAe's new management may have had its share of luck, but at least it has ridden it well.</p>

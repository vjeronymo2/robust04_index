			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 27 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa intends to continue efforts throughout this week to  pursue timing for a cabinet reshuffle that is expected to focus  on removing Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura from that  key post, political sources said Sunday.    Hosokawa said Sunday he will deliver a policy speech to the  Diet probably on March 7 instead of Friday as earlier planned.    The remark appeared to mean that the prime minister will  continue talks on a cabinet shake-up with leaders of seven  coalition parties by the end of this week.    The Social Democratic Party [of Japan, SDPJ], the Democratic  Socialist Party and Takemura's Sakigake, however, remain opposed  to an early cabinet reshuffle.    Takemura, appearing Sunday on NHK-TV's "Political Debate"  talk show, said he thinks a reshuffle is desirable around two  months later from now after seeing the fiscal 1994 budget pass  the Diet around early May. But Takemura said it is finally up  to the prime minister to decide whether to shake up the cabinet  and that he will not oppose Hosokawa's decision.    Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), a core party in the ruling  coalition, which has pushed for an early cabinet reshuffle,  indicated having second thoughts on the reshuffle, political  sources said.    On the same NHK-TV program, senior Shinseito official Kozo  Watanabe said, "it's one idea that the present cabinet should be  in office until the passage of fiscal 1994 budget through the  Diet," expected in May. Watanabe, however, reiterated  Shinseito's position to support Hosokawa if he decides to  reorganize the nearly seven-month-old cabinet.    Shinseito leader and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, speaking  at a news conference in the central Japan city of Matsumoto,  Nagano Prefecture, said Hosokawa should swiftly reshuffle the  cabinet if he really thinks it necessary. "It is a problem for  us to continue lengthy discussions like this," Hata said.    Hata, also deputy prime minister, said, "it should be done  as  early as possible if Prime Minister Hosokawa judges it necessary  at any cost."    Meanwhile, a top official of the Social Democratic Party of  Japan (SDP) said Sunday "a cabinet shake-up may be physically  difficult" because of tight political schedules ahead. The SDPJ  official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said "a reshuffle  cannot be done in one day even if the prime minister wants to do  so."    Hosokawa has said that he may reshuffle the cabinet after  the  passage of a third supplementary budget for fiscal 1993 and the  enactment of amendments to political reform legislation.    The 2.19 trillion yen extra budget became law on Wednesday,  while the amended package for political reform laws is expected  to pass the Diet as early as Thursday.    On Friday, the cabinet will submit to the Diet the 73.08  trillion yen budget for fiscal 1994. Hosokawa and three cabinet  ministers will give policy speeches to both houses of the  legislature on March 7.    Many sources in the coalition have said the planned cabinet  shake-up is aimed at removing Takemura from the post of chief  cabinet secretary which serves as the top government spokesman  and chief of staff for the prime minister.    Since the close of last year, Hosokawa and Takemura have  differed over several important political themes, first on the  partial opening of Japan's rice market, then on the handling of  political reform bills, and on the imposition of a 7 percent  "national welfare tax" in place of the 3 percent consumption  tax, political sources said.    SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi Murayama, speaking on "Political  Debate" and on TV Asahi's "Sunday Project" talk show, called for  a summit among leaders of the seven ruling parties before  Hosokawa reshuffles the cabinet. "It is natural to seek  consensus through talks among the parties to strengthen the  foundation of the coalition government," Murayama said.    The head of the largest party of the coalition reiterated  that a reshuffle targeted at a specific minister "smells  something like a power struggle" and that "this is not the time  to carry out a cabinet reshuffle."</p>

			<p><P> September 1, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> OBITUARIES;  </P> <P> DR. ARTHUR CARLAN; CHIROPRACTOR  </P> <P> Dr. Arthur Carlan, a longtime Northridge chiropractor and Canoga Park resident,  has died in North Hollywood. He was 71.  </P> <P> Carlan died Aug. 24 from complications of lymphoma, said his son, Robert  Carlan.  </P> <P> Born in Brooklyn, N.Y., on Oct. 29, 1918, Carlan attended the Pratt Institute  in Brooklyn for a year following high school, studying graphic arts and pen and  ink drawing. He served for five years in the U.S. Army during World War II,  achieving the rank of first lieutenant. After he was discharged, he graduated  from the Logan College of Chiropractic in St. Louis.  </P> <P> He moved to California in 1951 and received his chiropractor's license, but  instead went to work in the computer field. He held positions as a programmer  and a systems analyst at Lockheed Corp. in Burbank and the Marquardt Co. in Van  Nuys. In the late 1960s he was appointed director of education at the  now-defunct Computer Training Institute in Encino. He later worked in a systems  analyst at Litton Industries in Woodland Hills.  </P> <P> In 1970, he opened a chiropractic office in Northridge, where he worked  full-time until two years ago when he cut back his hours to part-time.  </P> <P> Family members said Carlan will be remembered for his humor, and his knack of  having a joke for every situation. He wrote humorous rhymes that he complied  into a 1983 book titled "If the Shoe Fits."  </P> <P> He had a variety of interests including table tennis, bowling and billiards and  helped start a Toastmasters Club in Northridge in the mid-1970s. He also  enjoyed swing and ballroom dancing and was a member of the Tuesday Senior Dance  Club, based in Sun Valley.  </P> <P> He is survived by his wife of 47 years, Etta Carlan; a son, Robert Carlan of  Beverly Hills; a daughter, Marlene Carlan of Los Angeles; and a sister, Lynn  Ribakove of Brooklyn, N.Y.  </P> <P> A funeral service was held Wednesday with burial at Eden Memorial Park in  Mission Hills. Groman-Eden Mortuary in Mission Hills handled the arrangements.  Donations can be made in Carlan's name to the Jewish National Fund in Los  Angeles, which plants trees in Israel, or to the General Israel Orphans Home  for Girls, 132 Nassau St., N.Y., N.Y. 10038.  </P></p>

			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Price war is forecast for life policies Commission disclosure in the life insurance industry will quickly trigger a price war as banks and building societies take advantage of their lower distribution costs, says accountancy firm Coopers &amp; Lybrand. The ability to price products differentially to reflect the costs of selling through various distribution channels will lead life companies which use more than one channel to concentrate on their core method of distribution, it forecasts. Differential pricing is to be allowed in the new regime for disclosing more information about commissions and costs. The regime, which requires the new disclosure rules to be met by the start of next year, has been demanded by regulators. A Coopers analysis of the costs of companies operating mainly through one of three distribution channels - banks, independent financial advisers and a direct sales force - suggests that a significant price differential exists for the banks and building societies. The estimated average costs of acquiring new business as a percentage of annual premium equivalent (regular premium income plus 10 per cent of single premium income) range from 60 per cent for banks and building societies to 89 per cent for those using independent advisers and 95 per cent for companies using a direct sales force. Mr Angus Hislop, a senior financial services partner at Coopers, said yesterday that the analysis also highlighted the scope for cost savings. In each category, the highest expense ratio in the range was at least 25 percentage points higher than the average. Among companies using mainly independent advisers it was more than 50 percentage points higher. The Coopers forecast points in the same direction as research last month by the Securities and Investments Board which suggested that commissions would fall by about 20 per cent as a result of the new regime. Mr Hislop said that he would expect the move to have the worst impact on smaller, non-specialised sales forces. It would not affect independent advisers so badly because there had already been a shake-out in that part of the sector. He added that, while distribution through banks and building societies was clearly the cheapest method, the life-product proportion of overheads for bank and building society branch networks should rise. That would happen as more space in branches was devoted to selling and less to processing transactions.</p>

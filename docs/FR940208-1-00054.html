			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The only potential secondary impact involves solid waste disposal, which may result in cases where carbon adsorbers are used to comply with the emission standards at bulk terminal loading racks. Spent activated carbon from these units is normally reclaimed for reuse during the carbon's useful life, and then discarded when it is no longer effective (usually 10 years) or reactivated in a furnace. If the average annual solid waste impact of this disposal (assuming no reactivation) is spread over the estimated life of the carbon, an overall environmental impact of about 230 megagrams per year (0.7 megagrams per terminal) results. Consequently, the magnitude of the adverse solid waste disposal impact occurring from the implementation of any of these alternatives is considered small.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> 8. Consideration of Energy Impacts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> There is a beneficial nationwide energy impact associated with implementation of each of the alternatives. Implementation of LDAR programs and installation of secondary seals on storage tanks both result in energy savings, since additional gasoline is kept in the tanks and lines, and remains available for sale rather than being allowed to escape to the atmosphere. Only a small amount of electrical energy would be required for most flares that may be installed at bulk terminal loading racks for emission control; however, assist gas may be necessary for some systems. Where thermal oxidation, refrigeration condenser, or carbon adsorption systems are installed to achieve compliance for loading racks, however, a moderate amount of electrical energy will be required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As mentioned earlier, vapor recovery (noncombustion) systems would recover gasoline from vapors collected at bulk terminal loading racks; LDAR programs, storage tank monitoring, and vacuum assist vapor collection all operate to reduce evaporation and improve leak prevention, so they result in gasoline savings. Assuming that 25 percent of the emission reduction at bulk terminal loading racks would be accomplished using recovery devices (the remainder would be the result of combustion devices) and subtracting the energy used by the recovery devices from the energy in the recovered product, the savings resulting from implementation of each of the alternatives are as follows: Alternative IV results in recovery of approximately 16 million gallons of gasoline per year, Alternative IV&hyph;Q saves almost 18 million gallons per year, and Alternative IV&hyph;M recovers slightly more than 19 million gallons per year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> 9. Selection of the Proposed Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In accordance with Clean Air Act section 112(d), the Administrator is required to set emission standards for new and existing sources of HAP's from source categories listed pursuant to section 112(c) [see the source category list proposal of July 16, 1992 (57 FR 31576)]. In doing so, the Administrator must require the maximum degree of reduction in emissions of HAP's that is achievable, taking into consideration the cost of achieving the emission reduction, any nonair quality health and environmental impacts, and energy requirements. Having given full consideration to these directives, the Administrator has selected Alternative IV&hyph;Q as the basis for the proposed standards for gasoline distribution major sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All three alternatives discussed earlier (IV, IV&hyph;Q, and IV&hyph;M) satisfy the Act's criteria. Alternative IV achieves the least HAP emission reduction and is the least stringent possible alternative allowed by the Act statutory language. However, the Act provides for setting standards above the floor. As a result, Alternatives IV&hyph;M and IV&hyph;Q contain control levels more stringent than the floor for existing sources (monthly and quarterly leak detection and repair of pumps and valves, respectively). Results of emission reduction calculations show that Alternative IV&hyph;M achieves greater HAP emission reductions than IV&hyph;Q or the floor Alternative IV. Additionally, analysis shows that Alternative IV&hyph;Q and IV&hyph;M would have minor economic and nonair quality environmental impacts, and beneficial energy impacts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although Alternative IV&hyph;M would achieve the maximum reduction in HAP emissions, there is uncertainty in the calculation of emission reductions for leak detection and repair (as discussed in section 4). Due to this uncertainty in emissions and the increased cost of Alternative IV&hyph;M, Alternative IV&hyph;Q was chosen over the more stringent Alternative IV&hyph;M.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> D. Selection of the Format of the Proposed Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 112(h) of the Act requires that standards be promulgated in terms of a numerical emission standard except when it is not feasible for the pollutants to be emitted through a conveyance or it is not practicable to apply measurement methodology due to technological or economic limitations. In these cases, the Administrator may promulgate a design, equipment, work practice, or operational standard that is consistent with the intent of section 112.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed under Section B above, there are four distinct categories of emission sources at bulk gasoline terminals: (1) Displacement losses when gasoline tank trucks or railcars are loaded at loading racks, (2) fugitive vapor losses from leaking tank trucks or railcars during controlled loading operations, (3) losses from storage tanks, and (4) vapor leaks from equipment components. The latter two emission sources also occur at pipeline breakout stations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

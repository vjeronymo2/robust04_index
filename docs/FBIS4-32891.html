			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Maria Lilibeth Dacorte in the Caraballeda Parish; </F> from the "Union Radio News" newscast; broadcast in progress]    [Text] ...after the meeting, the secretary general of the  Democratic Action Party, Luis Alfaro Ucero, officially announced  that Carlos Andres Perez, twice nominated and elected president  of the Republic, had been expelled from the party.    [Begin recording] [Alfaro Ucero] After meeting at length  with  many party members, [words indistinct] more than 80 percent of  those attending the meeting voted to support the decision  adopted by the National Executive Committee [CEN]. You know what  the CEN had decided. The other....    [Reporter, interrupting] [Words indistinct] he has been  definitely expelled from the party?    [Alfaro Ucero] Yes. I ratified the decision made by the CEN  regarding Carlos Andres Perez. The other decision made by the  CEN -- this decision was read at this meeting and it was signed  by all the secretaries general [words indistinct] -- was to give  ample and solid support to the secretary general and  organization secretary.    [Reporter] Claudio Fermin and [words indistinct] charged  that  no one voted on this decision. Please explain this to us.    [Alfaro Ucero] That depends on how you view this. It depends  on how one wishes to present to the public the way the meeting  was conducted. [end recording]    AD Secretary General Alfaro Ucero denied there is division  within the party, and he said the party is being strengthened.  He said decisions such as this one are normal within the party.  According to Alfaro Ucero, time will decide which path the party  should take.    As expected, Alfaro supporters and Perez supporters gauged  their strength within the CEN, and, judging from the outcome, it  is obvious that the Alfaro supporters had a majority of votes.  According to Claudio Fermin, the rank and file do not support  this decision.</p>

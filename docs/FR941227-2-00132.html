			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Finally, the Commission believes that the SROs' decision to ``grandfather'' the capital structure <FOOTCITE>31</FOOTCITE>  of all listed (or qualified for inclusion in the Nasdaq System) companies that have taken action inconsistent with the new Policy is reasonable and, for the reasons discussed herein, consistent with the purposes of the Act. First, the Commission believes that it would be unduly burdensome upon issuers to require them to go back in time and unwind transactions in order to come into compliance with the Policy. Second, the Commission believes that the Policy is a forward looking proposal to prevent disenfranchising transactions and that it would not be equitable to force issuers to try to undo transactions previously effected. Finally, the Commission believes that the grandfather provision of the Policy is necessary to avoid unfair discrimination between issuers, in that issuers will not be required to change their capital structures in order to come into compliance with rules to which they were not subject when creating such a capital structure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 31 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Under the Policy's grandfather provision, issuers can continue to issue additional amounts of any security which is a part of the capital structure being grandfathered. This would include super voting stock, time phased voting plans, and capped voting plans so long as the characteristics of such stock remains unchanged. For instance, if pursuant to an existing time-phased voting plan, the trigger date is four years, the issuer could not issue a new class of stock with a different trigger date or change the trigger date of the existing class. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Statutory Requirements Applicable to Securities Exchanges and Associations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As noted above, the Commission has reviewed the proposed rule changes to ensure that they ``are not designed to permit unfair discrimination between *&blank;*&blank;* issuers'' pursuant to Sections 6(b)(5) and 15(A)(6) of the Act and ``do not impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of [the Act]'' pursuant to Sections 6(b)(8) and 15A(b)(9). <FOOTCITE>32</FOOTCITE>  In addition, the Commission finds that the proposed rule changes are appropriate in the public interest, and necessary for the protection of investors. For several reasons, the Commission believes that the Policy fulfills these requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 32 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78f(5)(5), 78o&hyph;3(b)(9) (1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> First, the Policy is not designed to permit unfair discrimination among issuers. As noted above, the Policy will be applicable to all Section 12 registered securities listed or quoted on the respective markets. On Nasdaq this includes both Nasdaq NMS and Nasdq Small Cap companies and on Amex this includes EM listed companies. In addition, although an issuer participating in a violative transaction may no longer be listed on any of the three markets, this is not the result of unfair discrimination. The nature of a listing or eligibility requirements is to set standards with which all issuers must comply in order to have ready access to the market. Indeed, the Act recognizes that U.S. securities markets will develop their own eligibility standards for securities traded on their markets and duelist those companies which do not comply. Thus, the Commission believes that the adoption of the Policy as a listing or eligibility standard for the respective Eros does not unfairly discriminate among issuers and thus is consistent with the provisions of Sections 6(b)(5) and 15A(b)(6) of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, the Commission believes that the Policy will enhance the ability of the Exchanges and the NASA to fulfill their responsibilities under Sections 6(b)(5) and 15A(b)(6) of the Act. In particular, the Commission believes that the Policy is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practice, and to promote just and equitable principles of trade. Moreover, the Policy is designed to protect investors and the public interest. <FOOTCITE>33</FOOTCITE>  As discussed above, the Policy protects investors from disparate voting rights plans that result in disenfranchisement, which eliminates a shareholder's right to have any effect on future corporate decisions through transactions that are not fully subject to market discipline. At the same time, however, the Policy is crafted to permit disparate voting rights plans that do not disenfranchise existing shareholders and assure that the creation of shares with lesser voting rights are subject to market discipline. This avoids unduly rights are subject to market discipline. This avoids unduly burdening issuers and allows for flexibility in devising a corporation's capital structure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 33 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5), 78o&hyph;3(b)(6) (1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Third, the Commission also believes the Policy will not pose an inappropriate burden on competition among markets because the Policy only sets a minimum threshold standard common to all three SROs. Each SRO is free to adopt a stricter standard in competing for listings, if it chooses to do so. Further, the Policy still permits the SROs to compete for listings based upon a variety of other factors such as the quality of their markets, services offered, and fees charged. Finally, in regard to competition among issuers, the Policy only restricts issuers to the extent that they act to disenfranchise shareholders but allows them to adopt a panopoly of non-disenfranchising structures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg June 2 SAPA -- One of eight AWB  [Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging; Afrikaner Resistance Movement]  suspects being sought by police in connection with a series of  bomb blasts on the Witwatersrand handed himself over to  authorities on Wednesday [1 June], SAPS [South African Police  Services] spokesman Col Dave Bruce said on Thursday.    The suspect would appear in the Johannesburg magistrates  court at 2PM on Thursday (today) to make a bail application, the  colonel added. The suspect, a member of the AWB's so-called  "ystergarde" (iron guard), was as yet the only one of the eight  outstanding suspects to have been arrested, Col Bruce said.    Several other rightists have already appeared in court in  connection with the blasts. Most have been granted bail.</p>

Abbasov reported that his government had drafted a plan on  joint bazaars, and the republican leadership had been doing all  it could to open such markets.    The project provides for stimulating the delivery of food  and  other prime necessity items to Azerbaijan from Iran. There will  be primarily barter trade to keep Azerbaijan's currency reserves  intact. Proceeds from market sales will be exempted from taxes.    Abbasov spoke highly of Iran's humanitarian relief to  Azerbaijani refugees and welcomed Iran's proposal to set up a  chain of Iranian shops in Azerbaijan.</p>

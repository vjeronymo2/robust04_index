			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Alejandro Bolanos Davis] </F>   [Text] Minister Antonio Lacayo appeared on Carlos Briceno's  program, "Why Nicaragua Matters to Us." As he is a public figure  subject to criticism, and as he openly expressed views affecting  the nation and individuals, I will now express my opinion of his  behavior.    In listening to Minister Lacayo it was obvious that his  unconscious betrayed him several times. On this occasion I will  mention only two such moments.    In answering a question about the problem of property  rights,  Lacayo said that "property belongs to the one who has it" and  added: "What can be done is confisc...(then he  corrected himself) compensate..."people who have been unjustly  affected. Obviously, the truth came out unintentionally: that  his government is confiscating from many people  unjustly hurt by the Sandinist regime in favor of the Sandinists.    He also mentioned being struck on his "two faces" instead of  saying his "two cheeks." Here another great truth also escaped  from him unintentionally: the autocratic face he displays inside  the government and the face of a democrat that he unsuccessfully  tries to show in public.    In this program we could see what the minister is and what  he  is not. We again saw the arrogant and defensive man who  intellectualizes his contradiction-laden answers. We saw him try  to justify his mistakes without actually admitting them and  without expressing any regret. We heard him say there was  progress when what there is is unemployment and extreme poverty,  and that the violators of the government program (the  "reactionaries") were the members of UNO [National Opposition  Union] and not Lacayo himself. We heard him say that he relies  more on what people like Jimmy Carter, the "chinos" [not further  specified], and international bankers say than on what his own  Nicaraguan compatriots say. He said Violeta Chamorro is in  charge, but he is the one who makes the decisions, who lives in  close contact with the FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation  Front], and that he makes concessions to the FSLN so  "governability will be feasible," but this is not a  co-government. He said he wants democracy, but will be happy to  keep the totalitarian Sandinist Constitution until 1997, and he  repeated many other contradictions as well. It is very easy for  the subconscious to betray a person full of contradictions and  manipulation. That is what happened to Minister Lacayo on Carlos  Briceno's program.    Antonio Lacayo is trying to construct a false political  "center" based on erroneous situational ethics. He is trying to  concoct an agreement between kidnappers and their hostages,  between executioners and prisoners, between looters and the  looted, as if nothing had happened. He wants to impose a  reconciliation with injustice. He wants people to pardon their  aggressors without the aggressors repenting for their crimes and  without returning what was stolen. And to top it all, he wants  the aggressor to retain a license to continue committing crimes.    This "center morality" which Lacayo advocates is downright  immorality. Minister Lacayo cannot be unaware that there are  basic laws of life or universal principles that operate  independently of the individual. Everyone has these laws and/or  principles imprinted on his conscience. This internal voice  tells us if what we are doing at any given moment is right or  wrong.    The minister should try to listen to the voice of his  conscience. He will have to pause for a moment so he can  concentrate on it, and reflect and meditate on what it is saying  to him. One impediment he might have is the insane level of  activity that has overwhelmed him, along with his pro-Sandinist  political and cultural conditioning. These obstacles deaden his  sensitivity to heed the voice of his conscience and so to  comprehend how out of step he is with life's basic laws.    I congratulate Carlos Briceno for being able to put his  finger on the sore spot and for his skill as an interviewer.</p>

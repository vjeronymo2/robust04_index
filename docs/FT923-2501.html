			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / InterCity to offer bistro-style service BRITISH RAIL'S InterCity sector launched a vigorous campaign yesterday aimed at luring back passengers lost because of the recession. Innovations include cut-price first-class tickets for leisure travellers, a bistro-style restaurant car service and the introduction of customer welcome teams at main InterCity stations. Mr Chris Green, InterCity's managing director, said revenues were heading for a Pounds 50m shortfall in the present financial year because of a downturn in business and leisure travel. Costs had been cut and all non-essential investment postponed. But new customers had to be attracted to rail if InterCity was to stay in the black this year. One part of the campaign will aim to tap the budget end of the travel market with cut-price offers. Airline-style Apex tickets, which offer low-price fares to those booking a week in advance, will be extended to all InterCity journeys of more than 150 miles. The new Leisure First ticket, aimed at the leisure market, will offer half-price first-class travel provided the time away includes a Saturday night. A London-Bristol return will cost Pounds 43.50 instead of Pounds 87.</p>

Yi conveyed the  message while speaking at the commencement ceremony for the  reserve officers' training corps held at the students' Central  Military School in Seongnam, a satellite city on the outskirts  of Seoul.    He said, "North Korea should solve the common problems of  South and North Korea by showing a more sincere attitude."    The North is delaying progress in inter-Korean talks  intentionally, asking for things having nothing to do with the  heart of the talks at a recent working-level contact on  exchanging special envoys, Yi said.    "In order to win the unlimited competition in the world, all  Koreans should concentrate on strengthening the nation's  international competitiveness. For this, it is most important  for the military to keep a water-tight national security  posture."</p>

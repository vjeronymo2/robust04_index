			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Cannabis Found in 10 Percent of </F> Driver Samples"]    [Text] Traces of cannabis were found in blood tests taken  from almost 10 percent of drivers stopped by Reykjavik police on  suspicion of drunk driving during the second half of 1992 and  the first six months of 1993.    This was revealed recently at a press conference held by the  Department of Pharmacology at the University of Iceland, where  during the period in question, 200 samples were tested; 19  contained traces of the drug and 171 showed an alcohol content  below the legal limit of 0.5 percent.    As the research team, headed by Professor Thorkell  Johannesson and operating in close cooperation with the police  forces with the Reykjavik conurbation and the Traffic Safety  Council, was originally concerned only with alcohol levels, 17  of the first 171 drivers tested who later proved to have traces  of cannabis in their blood will not now have to face prosecution.    Since cannabis is a banned substance in Iceland and its  possession and use punishable by law, no special provision is  made in the road traffic laws regarding driving under the  influence. Technically, therefore, anyone convicted of doing so  does not run the risk of losing his license.    Each year from 2,000 to 4,000 drivers are stopped by police  on suspicion of drunk driving, and it is estimated that alcohol  is involved in some 50 accidents every year, with drivers under  the legal limit in 10 percent of those cases. This latter group  has received particular attention from the team.    Speaking to national media, Johannesson and Reykjavik Police  Chief Bodvar Bragson said there was now an urgent need to  investigate the presence of other drugs, particularly  amphetamine, in blood samples taken from drivers.</p>

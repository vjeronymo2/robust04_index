			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / Mexico slims peso The Mexican government will cut three zeros from its currency today in a move to simplify monetary transactions which often run into trillions of pesos, writes Damian Fraser in Mexico City. A dinner for four in a top Mexico City restaurant that costs around 1,000,000 old pesos (Pounds 213) will fall to just 1,000 new pesos from January 1. Alternatively, the minimum daily wage of 12,000 old pesos will be a mere 12 pesos. Old and new pesos will both be accepted in a transitional stage. Prices will be posted in both units, and old and new notes will look alike, to prevent shops using the change to raise prices.</p>

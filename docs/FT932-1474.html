			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets: Well-heeled Palestinians boost equities in Amman - Share price growth in Jordan Although Jordan has one of the smallest economies in the Arab world (GDP last year was Dollars 4.8bn at current producer prices), its stock market is one of the most developed and profitable. Buoyed by real GDP growth of 11 per cent last year and the arrival of around 300,000, mostly well-heeled, Palestinians from the Gulf, the Amman Financial Market (AFM) climbed by nearly 30 per cent in 1992, making it one of the fastest growing emerging markets in the world. With 120 listed companies, the AFM's equity market capitalisation stands at around JD3bn. This year, its general share price index had risen by a further 26 per cent to 164.34 by yesterday, making a gain of nearly two-thirds since it was based at 100 in December 1991. Stock market turnover, since January 1, had risen to JD460.5m by mid-June, up 26 per cent from JD370.9m in the same period last year. And, on the basis of earnings so far in 1993, the market is selling on a price/earnings ratio (p/e) of 20. Trading has been prolific this year, with daily volumes running well above levels previously seen. In May the share price index advanced by 9.7 per cent, and on certain days in June the value of trade peaked at as much as JD16m compared with a daily average of JD6m in May. Last week the central bank was forced to reduce credit to speculators in an attempt to cool down the bullish bourse. But this has done little to diminish growing enthusiasm in the market. Although the government and its agencies own substantial stakes in many Jordanian companies, particularly in tourism and the minerals sector, the Amman market still has a relatively large float. Approximately one-half of the total market is available for trading, and it is estimated that more than 100,000 Jordanians are active in the stock market, a higher number than in any other Arab country. Non-Arab foreign investors have to obtain appproval from the government before trading (a formality which should normally take no more than a few days through a local broker). Then their only restriction, at the moment, is that foreigners are not allowed to own more than 49 per cent of most businesses. Capital and dividends can be repatriated through a bank as long as foreign currency brought in was declared for the original investment. The market's success is a flattering reflection of the country's economic fortunes. In spite of the cataclysmic events in 1989, when the Jordanian dinar was forced to devalue by 45 per cent, and in 1990 at the initial stages of an International Monetary Fund adjustment programme when Iraq invaded Kuwait, the kingdom's economy has bounced back to achieve record growth rates. The Gulf returnees brought with them an estimated Dollars 1.5bn which fuelled a major construction boom in the kingdom and increased liquidity. Fat corporate profits in many sectors last year, particularly banking, buoyed confidence in the market. And stockbrokers say optimism over the Middle East peace talks is also encouraging investment. In light of the recent spate of market activity, however, there are fears in some quarters that certain shares are overvalued. Mr Saed Nabulsi, Jordan's central bank governor, says he is worried about the level of equity appreciation, especially with shares in the services and industry sector. And there is concern that the market euphoria is currently driven by short term investors with hit-and-run tactics. But Mr Umayya Toukan, the AFM's director general, claims he is happy with the overall p/e of 20 in comparison with other markets worldwide. A daily price ceiling of plus or minus 5 per cent currently operates on individual shares as a market stabiliser. Whatever the outcome of the market's present apparent overheating, the AFM does seem to have a bright future. The Jordanian dinar has been stable at its present level for the past 30 months or more (Dollars 1:JD0.689); GDP is predicted to grow steadily by around 5 per cent for the next few years; and as business confidence becomes the norm, Jordan can expect to see the steady trickle of repatriations increase. Estimates of funds held by Jor-danians overseas range from Dollars 5bn to Dollars 10bn. Moreover, given a peace settlement with Israel or a lifting of sanctions on Iraq, then Jordan could become another Singapore in the desert.</p>

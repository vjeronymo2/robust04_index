			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yonis Garcia] </F>   [Text] Upon leaving Miraflores, Finance Minister Julio Sosa  Rodriguez asserted that his office estimates the country will  earn additional income of approximately 6 billion bolivares from  PDVSA [Venezuelan Petroleum] thanks to an increase in oil prices  in May.    According to the minister, this income will help efforts to  balance the budget deficit. "But I don't have too many hopes. I  believe we will earn enough foreign exchange to be able to meet  the country's needs--I mean, all its exports and the debt  servicing. I should point out that the increase in the price of  oil is due to an increase in demand for oil and the improving  U.S. economic situation."    The minister reported the government has collected 3.1  billion bolivares in bank debit taxes. "We have not had any  problems in collecting those revenues. The system has worked  satisfactorily, and the banking sector has not had any computer  problems."    Regarding the concession law approved by the Council of  Ministers, Sosa Rodriguez said the legal mechanism for  construction of public works will attract foreign investors to  the country and will provide economic compensation for the  budget cuts made to several national interest projects.    Referring to the sales tax law, the finance minister  affirmed  that this law will be approved by the executive on Wednesday.  When he was asked if they planned to extend the tax on banking  debits, he replied: "I don't think it's right to extend this  tax."    The IMF visit to Venezuela has triggered public expectations  regarding the economic conditions and programs it plans to  suggest to the government. In this respect, Sosa stated: "From a  psychological point of view, it would be good for the IMF to  officially prop up the level of our reserves and make a public  statement on the situation. This would have a positive impact on  our economy and deter the negative influence of speculators and  rumors about our currency. In conclusion, it would make it more  difficult for speculators who work in our markets."    Likewise, he added that the only point the IMF could  question  is the suspension of the value-added tax (VAT). "Everyone knows  this tax had to be lifted because the country was neither  prepared nor organized to collect this kind of revenue. The  methodology was used for commercial speculation to the detriment  of the citizens."    On the same subject, the minister said: "Another thing the  IMF could ask is why we have not increased the price of  gasoline. On this point, I have always said we are going through  an economic crisis, an inherited chaos, and to straighten things  out we need to grant several administration subsidies to the  collective transportation sector."    On another topic, Sosa Rodriguez asserted that he is still  studying the possibility of requesting support or other types of  help from the IMF. "For the time being, however, both the IMF  and the government, as had been planned, will work together for  two weeks to study the economic situation and come up with a  joint assessment."    Another international financial organization that recently  visited Venezuela was the World Bank. Julio Sosa Rodriguez said  that the World Bank officials met with President Caldera. "They  came to help us with the subsidized banks, and I believe their  observations have been very positive. They offered to send us  this week, a group of technicians to help Fogade [Deposit  Guarantee and Banking Protection Fund] and the Banking  Superintendent's Office in solving management and financial aid  problems."    Sosa reported the executive had requested credits, which are  fully justified, for 156 billion bolivares from Congress. This  money includes the resources for paying all government  employees, including those in the Judiciary Council. "The only  observation the Congress's Finance Commission had on my request  was that I had not included allotments for corresponding social  benefits."</p>

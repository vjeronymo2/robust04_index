A criterion and method for VISSR focusing are  proposed and the experimental results for frequency-spectrum  analysis using fast Fourier transforms (FFT) on stretched  digital cloud images received from the Japanese GMS-4 satellite  are given. The tests show that this method is useful and  practical for in-orbit focusing control of a GMS's VISSR.    Figure 1, not reproduced, is a flow chart for VISSR  focusing.  Figure 2, reproduced below, depicts the system equipment. There  are no tables.   References    1.

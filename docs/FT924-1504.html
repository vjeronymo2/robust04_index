			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Survey of Zambia (1): Fresh start for Africa's newest democracy - While the government is bravely implementing radical reforms, more help is needed to combat a severe drought and to overcome the legacy of the Kaunda years AFTER more than 25 debilitating years of mismanagement and regional wars, Zambia is making a fresh start. Peaceful elections in October 1991 marked the collapse of one party rule. A country once synonymous with African socialism has embarked on a reform programme as radical as any undertaken in Africa, which is being implemented at an unprecedented pace. Fourteen months after his overwhelming victory in Zambia's first multi-party elections in two decades, President Frederick Chiluba has won plaudits from donors and endorsements from the IMF and World Bank. Yet although aid and debt relief have been substantial Africa's newest democracy is under strain. The worst drought in living memory has contributed to a 10 per cent fall in gross domestic product fall. Government and private sector management is weak and daily depleted by Aids. Inflation is running at more than 100 per cent, on a year-on-year basis. Infrastructure is frail, social services are impoverished and industry needs re-equipping. Export receipts and aid flows may be enough for bare survival, but fall far short of what is needed for sustained recovery. Further painful reforms lie ahead and the impact on Zambia's social and political fabric will be severe. 'To make democracy work we need a sound economic base, and that we are unable to provide without more help,' said President Frederick Chiluba. Last October Mr Chiluba, a former trade unionist, led the Movement for a Multi-party Democracy to a sweeping victory. The MMD won 125 of the 150 National Assembly seats and Mr Chiluba secured 81 per cent of the presidential poll. For the first time since 1972, when Zambia became a one party state, the country had a choice. The electorate could hardly have been more emphatic in its rejection of the country's founding president, Mr Kenneth Kaunda and the United National Independence Party, in power since independence in 1964. In the weeks that followed the new government began tackling the legacy of Mr Kaunda. Executives of state owned corporations created under a late 1960s nationalisation programme were sacked. Subsidies were cut, the kwacha was soon to be further devalued, the agricultural marketing system liberalised. Fresh impetus was given to the privatisation of 130 state-owned companies including Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines, responsible for more than 90 per cent of export earnings. It was as rude a shock as any African economy has experienced, but shock therapy was necessary, argued Mr Emmanuel Kasonde, the finance minister, when he delivered the MMD's first budget address in January. 'Our bitter experiences of the past have shown that piece-meal or half-hearted implementation of reform will get us no-where,' he told the National Assembly. The MMD inherited a disaster with roots that go back many years. When Zambia won independence from Britain in 1964 it had one of the highest per capita incomes of any black African state. By the time Mr Kaunda ceded power, Zambia had become - in per capita terms - one of the world's most indebted nations, its 8m people owing external creditors more than Dollars 7bn. Mr Kaunda's own inheritance was not easy. Zambia's colonial era ended with about 100 university graduates. From the start of independence, landlocked Zambia was in the front line of southern Africa's battles, at considerable cost: transport routes were disrupted, defence spending soared. To Mr Kaunda's credit, Zambia remained stable in a region at war, but far from resolving the problems he inherited, he compounded them, nationalising the country's two copper mines in the late 1960s, along with much of the rest of the economy. Agriculture suffered from too much state regulation and too little investment. Millions of kwacha were spent on white elephants, such as the Tika steel project. In 1975 came a blow from which Zambia has yet to recover. The price of copper, accounting for over 90 per cent of export earnings, plummeted for the second time in five years. By 1977 ZCCM's contribution to government revenue had fallen from nearly 55 per cent of the total to nil, while nearly two thirds of the foreign exchange earnings were taken up by the cost of production. The next 14 years saw a succession of failed recovery plans. The most serious obstacle to reform proved to be Mr Kaunda himself, reluctant to relinquish his socialist vision, presiding over a corrupt and authoritarian party. By 1990, when he buckled under domestic and international pressure and reluctantly accepted multiparty elections, Zambia's fortunes had reached their nadir. Most donors had frozen aid, arrears in repayment to the IMF had reached Dollars 1.2bn and the outgoing government had spent millions of kwachas of state money in an attempt to buy victory. The MMD, a broad coalition bringing together labour leaders, Unip defectors, prominent businessmen and a new generation of politicians and technocrats, has achieved much. Its efficient response to the drought has been widely praised. ZCCM output has risen under the new management, a markedly improved business environment is more conducive to foreign investment and the privatisation programme is proceeding apace. But long-suffering Zambians face more pain. The price of the staple food, maize, which has soared 500 per cent in real terms, rose again this month. Turning overstaffed state owned companies - notably Zambia Airways - into commercially viable organisations means more job losses. Cutting inflation - the aim is an annualised rate of 20 per cent by end-93 - requires further spending cuts and reductions in the civil service. In last month's local government elections the MMD won a comfortable victory but the percentage turn-out barely reached double figures, reflecting the weakness of the opposition rather than a mandate for the MMD, whose honeymoon with the electorate is over. A flawed constitution inherited from Mr Kaunda, now under review, encourages an authoritarian streak in some ministers. It allows bans on freedom of assembly and fails to guarantee press freedom. Nor has the MMD's status been enhanced by national assembly members' decision to award themselves tax-free salaries of Dollars 1,000 a month. All this not only angers Zambians, it also undermines Mr Chiluba's plea for further assistance to help democracy take root. Yet for all the shortcomings, Mr Chiluba leads what is 'probably one of the most modern, open and forward-looking governments on the continent,' says Mr Mike Hall, editor of the Weekly Post. This new dimension to Zambia's leadership offers hope for the country's future, tempered by the conclusion of a 1989 World Bank paper analysing Zambia's record: 'When reform efforts finally got into high gear, the initial position was one of acute disequilibrium. The economy had no cushion and no safety net. Successful reform under these circumstances required nearly perfect foresight, technically valid policy packages, strong political commitment, uninterrupted implementation and good luck.' This might yet serve as warning that unless Zambia can rely on donors for further expertise and additional resources. President Chiluba warns: 'If we lose this opportunity, I see no way out of the quagmire.'</p>

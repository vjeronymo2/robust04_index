			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PONTIFF GREETS FELLOW POLE WITH BROTHERLY EMBRACE;  </P> <P> WALESA CALLS POPE SYMBOL OF SOLIDARITY  </P> <P> Celebrating the rebirth of Poland's free labor movement, a visiting Lech Walesa  made an emotional pilgrimage to the Vatican on Thursday to thank a white-robed  countryman who he said was the living symbol of Solidarity.  </P> <P> "I greet you with all my heart," exclaimed Pope John Paul II, wrapping Walesa  in a brotherly embrace.  </P> <P> The high-spirited Pope whisked Walesa into his private library for a half-hour  chat. There followed a patriots' lunch prepared by Polish nuns who learned  their cooking while John Paul was still Karol Wojtyla, bishop of Krakow, and  Walesa was an obscure shipyard electrician in Gdansk.  </P> <P> "My batteries are recharged. I can lift any weight," Walesa said after his  papal audience.  </P> <P> Spying a television crew from Gdansk, where Solidarity was born, the Pope  joked: "Gdansk. Ah, I remember Gdansk. The light comes from Gdansk."  </P> <P> Walesa's three-day Italian visit is intended to woo international political and  economic support for Polish reforms, and organizational and financial help for  Solidarity from well-heeled Italian unions that are his hosts.  </P> <P> In their talk, Walesa thanked John Paul for his support for Solidarity, caught  him up on details of events at home and noted that the once-again legal union  is rooted in the church's social doctrine, according to papal spokesman Joaquin  Navarro.  </P> <P> John Paul told Walesa that reforms give Poland the chance for "social,  political and economic transformation," Navarro said.  </P> <P> When Walesa and the Pope last met in 1987 on a papal visit to Poland,  Solidarity was illegal. On Monday, after months of delicate negotiations, in  which the church served simultaneously as a referee and a cheerleader, a court  registered Solidarity as a legal union. In the aftermath, Walesa left  immediately for Rome to thank a pontiff whose public and private support for  Solidarity never flagged in nearly eight years of official repression. "Save my  country, save Solidarity," the Pope prayed repeatedly during the dark days of  martial law in Poland.  </P> <P> Speaking after a standing ovation of doctors and medical students at Rome's  Gemelli Hospital Thursday, Walesa left no doubt of the Polish Pope's impact on  events in his homeland. John Paul spent five hours in emergency surgery at the  hospital in 1981 after being wounded by an assassin's bullets.  </P> <P> "Here the life of Solidarity was saved, because here the life of a great Pole,  the Holy Father, was saved," Walesa said.  </P> <P> For Walesa's first visit to Italy since 1981, there was constancy in the warmth  of his reception at the Vatican, but a dramatic change in his more temporal  welcome. When the longtime harassed underdog stepped from the Warsaw flight  Wednesday, the Polish ambassador to Italy was on hand to welcome him with a  spray of red and white roses.  </P> <P> Like the Vatican, the Italian government is treating Walesa almost as though he  were a head of state. Walesa, who is accompanied by his wife, Danuta, five  aides and the archbishop of Gdansk, meets today with President Francesco  Cossiga and Prime Minister Ciriaco De Mita in search of aid for a nation he  said is enduring "an economic disaster."  </P> <P> The union leader, who has an avid Italian following, will also confer today  with Italy's three top industrialists. Italian newspapers speculate that  economic initiatives for Poland from both the Italian state and the  export-hungry private sector may be in hand in time for a scheduled state visit  to Poland by Cossiga next month.  </P> <P> For his part, the Pope, who also met Thursday with Irish President Patrick J.  Hillery and renewed his call for a cease-fire in fighting between Christian  factions and Muslim and Syrian forces in Lebanon, begins intensive preparations  today for the first of four scheduled trips abroad this year. He leaves next  Friday for nine days in Africa, with stops in Madagascar, Malawi and Zambia, as  well as the French Indian Ocean island of La Reunion.  </P></p>

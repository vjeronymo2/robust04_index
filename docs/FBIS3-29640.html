The full lower house is expected to pass the supplementary  budget later in the day and to immediately send it to the House  of Councillors for further deliberations.    The budget is expected to become law Wednesday after  obtaining approval from the second chamber, Diet sources said.    The extra budget calls for a spending increase of 2,185.2  billion yen over the second supplementary budget, covering the  largest-ever economic stimulus package of 15.25 trillion yen,  and an increase of the overall general account budget for the  current year ending in March to 77,437.50 billion yen.</p>

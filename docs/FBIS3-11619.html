At a news conference in a Mexico City hotel today,  47-year-old Camacho Solis said he will not be a candidate in the  21 August presidential elections. He also said he will not be a  candidate for senator or deputy. "Yes, I would like to be  president of Mexico, but not at any price," Camacho Solis  stressed when he reiterated that he will not be a candidate in  the next electoral period, although he did not rule out that he  might run in the elections in the year 2000.    Camacho Solis said that "between seeking a presidential  candidacy and the contribution I can make to the peace process,  I choose peace. The decision might disappoint some, but I would  reproach myself if I placed another decision above peace."  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOME QUESTIONS FOR THE SERIOUS CYCLIST  </P> <P> The novice cyclist can buy all the right equipment and wear all the right  clothes, but it will take lots of time on the road to build endurance . . . not  to mention, conversational savvy.  </P> <P> Talking intelligently about cycling can be tough.  </P> <P> And you certainly want to say the right things between pulls off the water  bottle, right?  </P> <P> Just so you'll know what concerns the serious cyclist, here's a sampling from a  recent questionnaire in Bicycling magazine:  </P> <P>  -- What's the best food before a long ride?  </P> <P>  -- What's the best food after a long ride?  </P> <P>  -- Where's the worse place on your body to get road rash?  </P> <P>  -- What's the best-tasting sports drink?  </P> <P>  -- What's the worst make of car that can pass you on a narrow road?  </P> <P>  -- What's the best way to get grease off your hands?  </P> <P>  -- What's the best cure for chain suck?  </P> <P> This all may sound intimidating, but after you put in a few hundred miles,  you'll have opinions -- and probably first-hand experiences -- to relate.

			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FRAME FAME;  </P> <P> PACOIMA BIKES GO WORLDWIDE  </P> <P> It's not the kind of neighborhood that conjures up images of bicycling.  </P> <P> This section of Pacoima looks like a model for bad zoning laws. Small  wood-frame houses are mixed in with factories, warehouses and discount auto  dismantlers. The cement streets are cracked from the weight of big trucks. The  air has a chemical sting. It's the kind of place bicyclists find themselves  when the ride has gone bad and they're hopelessly lost.  </P> <P> "It's not the end of the world," John Slawta said, "but you can see it from  here."  </P> <P> However, it's in this end of the Valley that the 28-year-old Slawta has chosen  to make some of the most sought-after bike frames in the world. These frames go  from Pacoima to the Tour de France, to Italy for the Giro d'Italia and to  Montana for Harrison Ford. These are Landshark bikes -- custom-made and very  custom painted.  </P> <P> "Today is definitely ugly," Slawta said as he stands in the doorway of the  850-square-foot industrial space on Montague Street that he rents for $595 a  month. The low-slung multitenant building could be mistaken for a personal  storage company.  </P> <P> "You see that power plant over there? I figure how smoggy it is by how much  detail I can see on it. Today is definitely ugly."  </P> <P> Ugly day or not, Slawta has six bikes to get ready to ship this week. "I keep  it at six," he said. "It gives me goal and it's a reasonable number to get  done."  </P> <P> Because he makes and paints the bikes himself, six of the $760 frames -- this  is just for the frame, serious cyclists add their own wheels, brakes, gears and  other components -- are more than enough to keep him busy for the week.  </P> <P> He crosses the cement-floored room strewn with the odd, specialized tools of  the bike-makers trade. On the wall are postcards and letters racers have sent  him from around the world. A letter written in 1988 on the cheap stationery of  a hotel in Belgium is from Andy Hampsten, now one of the top American riders.  It begins, "Thanks for the bitchin' bike" and ends "my season is coming." Later  that year he won the Giro d'Italia riding one of Slawta's bikes.  </P> <P> The centerpiece of all this casually placed machinery is an $8,500 frame  fixture, which doesn't look very impressive. It's a holding device that  precisely aligns the tubing while it is being joined together, but it's so  basic it could have been designed in the 19th Century. The frame-builder's art  doesn't rely on high-tech computerized gizmos. It's the work of the seasoned  craftsman who combines mechanical talents with the right artistic touch.  </P> <P> "This is the quality control over here," Slawta said as he bends the rear part  of an almost-finished frame, measuring with oddly shaped tools as he goes  along. "You get them straight -- or straight enough."  </P> <P> Straight enough must satisfy the professional riders and fanatic amateurs who  are Slawta's clients, including actor Michael Nouri, Olympic volleyball  superstar Karch Kiraly, ex-Laker Billy Thompson and former San Francisco 49er  Dwight Clark. Getting the frame aligned perfectly is something they -- and  Slawta -- take extremely seriously.  </P> <P> The Prestige tubing he uses in making the frame is tricky to handle. The center  parts of the tubes are thinner than the ends, to make it lighter. The ends are  thicker where the tubes are brazed together (the metal is too heat-sensitive  for welding). As he tinkers with the rear part of the triangular frame the  metal seems to have a life of its own. He pushes it, it bounces back.  </P> <P> "These frames have a lot of spring in them," he said. He is surrounded by an  assortment oddly shaped tools, all of which have some specialized purpose in  measuring frame alignment.  </P> <P> "This is a frame-builders scale," he said as he attaches the frame to the  hand-held device. "You know a fisherman's scale makes everything weigh more,"  he said, "this one makes it weigh less."  </P> <P> Joking about frame weight would be heresy to his clients. In the world of  top-level bikes, less is definitely more. Racers are looking for the tiniest  edge. In last year's Tour de France, Greg LeMond made a phenomenal comeback on  the last day, winning by a few seconds. Some credit the victory to a new type  of handlebars he used that allowed him to lean forward and be more aerodynamic  as he pedaled. The tradition-bound French had dismissed the bars as just  another American gadget.  </P> <P> Slawta walks next door to a shop that makes fluorescent lights for the movie  industry to use their photocopying machine. While he's there he picks up an  order that's been faxed from Canada. At the rate of 300 bikes a year selling  for $760 each it's easy to figure that one of these days he's going to be able  to afford his own fax machine.  </P> <P> Placing the fax on the rack on which he's just been straightening frames, he  mulls over the numbers of the frame geometry -- how long the customers wants  the top tube, the seat tube, the angle of rake for the front wheel forks. All  of this is critical in deciding how the bike will ride.  </P> <P> Bikes used for touring are a little more slung out, like a large car with a  generous chassis. Racing bikes are tighter, stiffer, sometimes even a little  "twitchy" -- too responsive, like a sports car with a too tight suspension  system.  </P> <P> There's a strong scent of paint in the shop that's beginning to irritate his  visitor's throat. When it's brought to his attention Slawta looks up from the  fax, said he doesn't notice any paint smell, then looks up again. "That's kind  of scary, isn't it?" he asked.  </P> <P> Slawta has been around paint so much that he's become oblivious to it. In fact,  it was painting that originally brought the Landshark much of its fame. Slawta  once planned to attend Pasadena's Art Center College of Design. He now  expresses himself artistically with his bike frames. At a time when most bikes  were in staid, traditional colors, his frames looked like a modern art show on  wheels.  </P> <P> "My goal is to get people to react," Slawta said. "I like people to see the  bikes and have to respond."  </P> <P> Some frames are done in a pattern of Jackson Pollock-style drips, others evoke  the bright patterns of surfing clothes. There are amoebas and patterns that  wouldn't seem out of place on a Amazon Indian's face.  </P> <P> "I like people to look at my paint jobs and not know how I did it, even though  it only took minutes to make," Slawta said. "It's one of those things that to  do it right you have to do it quickly."  </P> <P> Slawta has spent almost his entire life in the Valley, but by the end of the  year he plans to move to southern Oregon. He does not know anyone there, he  said, but he feels the rural atmosphere will be a more creative place to work.  And since four out of five orders for his frames come from out of state, he's  not tied to Pacoima.  </P> <P> "I'm going to miss the convenience of living here," he said, looking out the  door at the power plant. "But if you've a chance to do things better, do it  now. The meter's running."  </P></p>

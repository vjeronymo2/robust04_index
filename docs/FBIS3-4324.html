			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Ren Kan: "Bank Trade To Centralize Most Foreign </F> Exchange"]    [Text] The People's Bank of China has issued a set of  provisional regulations on the selling, buying and payment of  foreign exchange to ensure smooth sailing for financial reform.    The regulations require all foreign exchange  receipts--except  those held by foreign-funded enterprises and domestic  individuals-- to be sold to designated banks. Foreign loans and  foreign exchange for debt repayment must also be handled by the  banks.    If foreign exchange is needed for import, export and other  purposes, it can be purchased at the banks.    The regulations, which take effect on April 1, are aimed at  consolidating the country's foreign exchange in the banks to  ensure sufficient supplies for converting renmenbi under current  accounts.    The official reaffirmed that the country will keep the  foreign- exchange swap market, where foreign funded ventures can  continue to buy and sell their foreign exchange instead of at  the banks.</p>

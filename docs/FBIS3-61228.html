How do you assess the results of the economic  reforms in 1993?    2. What, in your opinion, should we expect in 1994?    These questions are answered by leaders of the leading  economic-analytical centers of Russia. The materials will be  published in full in the international journal DELOVYYE LYUDI  (No. 12, 1993 and No. 1, 1994)  <H3>  Yevgeniy Saurov, Director of the Center for Information and  Social Technologies under the Government of the Russian  Federation: "Pouring Dollars into Mercedes Is Not Farsighted" </H3>   1. The experience of two years of reforms convinces us that  we have climbed onto an "economic roller coaster." In the  winter, by compressing the monetary mass we slow up the rates of  inflation. In the spring, by advancing credit we return to our  previous positions. Depending on the rates of inflation, the  level of production increases somewhat or, especially during  August-September, its decline increases. This is the second year  in which we have been living in such a cycle.    The amplitude of the fluctuations is somewhat less this  year.  It is still unrealistic to speak about putting an end to  inflation. 1993 was a year of in-depth study of the market by  enterprise leaders. While last year everyone went through what  might be called the introductory course, now they feel like  sophomores. There are more enterprises which are not certain  whether they will survive or not. Those that are not viable, of  course, do no good for the economy. They must be reprofiled,  showing concern for retraining the people. This work is already  underway during the process of privatization. This is a  gratifying phenomenon. There are also points of great  tension--the coal industry, for example.    I have my doubts about the published data on the decline of  production. It is fairly great. But it is linked primarily to  the reduction of military orders. To the reduction of the  "self-consuming" production of machine building. To the  reduction of the output of poor-quality products. While a year  ago there was a plethora in the viable branches, in 1993 signs  of a positive structural change appeared during the slump. Thus  things were not bad in the construction materials industry.  There was a very slight growth in housing construction, mainly  because of the individual sector. But the situation with  electric energy is alarming: With all the problems of the  economy, the consumption of kilowatt-hours is not decreasing.  The country has forgotten about economizing on resources. What  prices must we have for energy resources so that consumers will  finally begin to be concerned about economizing on them?!    It is bad that the dollar is not being put to work in the  country. Entrepreneurs, as before, prefer to keep their hard  currency abroad. There is a great disparity between exports and  imports. This is evidence of a prolonged poor condition in the  economy. The result of distortions in legislation and political  instability. Measures of law enforcement organs cannot solve  such economic problems. Russia can obtain a significant influx  of currency not from foreign investors but from "their own,"  those who are keeping their dollars abroad. Putting them into  circulation in the West, our ill-starred entrepreneurs have a  poor idea of the rules of the game in local markets and are not  aware of the immense risk to themselves. Incidentally, the risk  in Russia is even greater. This means that we must seriously  create conditions for business at home.    The fact that domestic prices are coming close to world  prices threatens to strike a blow to exports. Only high-quality  products can be moved. The game involving cheap raw material and  a cheap work force is coming to an end. But high quality  requires expenditures: the purchase of new technologies and so  forth. Pouring dollars into Mercedes is shortsighted. A new  reality will be clearly manifested in the forthcoming year.    The year 1993 was marked by development of reforms. It  proceeded as though of its own accord, with less participation  by the government, and with a smaller degree of state  regulation. The year showed that a fairly serious, aggressive  business has appeared in the country although, true, it is not  very civilized yet. It is in a state of development.    2. It is difficult to predict the situation today purely  economically: a great deal depends on political decisions. In  the absence of a pro-inflation parliament the government might  possibly be able to hold down the mass of money better  throughout the winter. But inflation could be significantly  encouraged by campaign promises and difficulties in relations  with the regions.    We will not manage to reduce inflation significantly in  1994.  The other danger--unemployment--might become serious. Not  catastrophic, but in any case it is very undesirable. It is  necessary to make the designation of social protection more  specific. As one of the developers of the new housing system I  am particularly against the same low payment for service for  privatized apartments for low-income families and for Konstantin  Borovoy. The income level must not be ignored.    The year will not bring the country out of its crisis. But I  hope that there will be more appreciable outcroppings of hope  than there were this year.  <H3>  Stanislav Shatalin, Academician, President of the  International Fund for Economic and Social Reforms, and Sergey  Fateyev, Chief of the Department of Reform Strategy of the Fund:  "It Will Not Be Possible To Compensate for the Collapse of the  Social Sphere" </H3>   1. It is not easy to give an assessment during a transition  period. There are at least two groups of criteria that lie on  completely different planes. The first are the directly  macroeconomic indicators of current development, and the second  are the institutional changes (since we are speaking about  reforms).    As for the first group of criteria, regardless of what has  been said about signs of "stabilization" in the economy, a sober  analysis of the results of three quarters of 1993 (there were no  statistical data for the fourth quarter by the time this text  was written.--Ed.) shows the opposite. The decline (as compared  to three quarters of 1992) in the majority of productions did  indeed slow up, but stabilization as a condition of steady  equilibrium and the appearance of signs of upsurge did not  occur. As a rule, the slowing up or even termination of the  recession in certain months in certain branches was then  replaced by a drop in production. Based on seasonal and random  factors it is still impossible to draw a conclusion about  stabilization. Taking into account the real condition of  production capital in the majority of branches, and the  continuing imbalance in the national economy, one can state that  the "low point" has not yet been reached. Incidentally, if one  considers the situation in retrospect it is not inappropriate to  recall that government representatives have already repeatedly  reported "signs of stabilization," but the time frames for it  are constantly being moved back.    The same thing can be said about inflation, the budget  deficit, etc. The reduction of the monthly rates of inflation by  the summer of 1993 from 25 percent to 17-19 percent was replaced  in August by an increase almost up to 30 percent, and then again  a certain slowing down. The reduction of the budget deficit was  again followed by an increase.    The standard of living of the population has continued to  decline. According to our estimates, the inflation index from  September 1992 through September 1993 was 1,254 percent, while  the growth of monetary incomes of the population during the same  period was 1,037 percent. The instability of economic  development during 1993 was accompanied by a collapse of the  social sphere, which it has not been possible to compensate for  in recent years even with the active formation of new principles  of social policy.    In general, economic development throughout almost all of  1993 proceeded under conditions of a keen political struggle,  and this fact alone could in no way contribute to economic  stabilization.    As for constitutional changes, that is, reformation as such,  here without any doubt there have been certain advances. The  number of privatized enterprises has increased significantly and  privatization has indeed become irreversible, although it is  frequently of a formally legal nature. The structure of property  is changing, all the new elements of the market infrastructure  are being created, and production is beginning to react to  demand. Nonetheless, since these processes are taking place in  an extremely unfavorable general economic situation in which a  high degree of monopolization is retained in many cases, the  changes are occurring randomly and without control.    Unless there are positive structural changes, under  conditions where price disproportions remain there is still the  probability of the creation of a pseudo-market with all the  consequences that ensue from that. Therefore, in our opinion,  although 1993 brought certain positive changes on the industrial  plane, they are still clearly not sufficient to enable us to  speak about the success of the reforms even in this area.    2. Naturally, there is no justification for speaking of any  economic advancement in 1994. As we know, the future of the  economy is being set today and yet the investment climate  throughout 1993 remained extremely unfavorable for the majority  of branches--the enterprises do not have the reserves for  successful operation.    What features of development in 1994 can be predicted as the  most probable? The overall decline of production will continue,  although at slower rates. At the same time the decline in  certain branches will begin to be partially compensated for by  advancement in others. There will be increased differentiation  in the economic position of the regions. The high level of  inflation will remain. It will be practically impossible to  reduce it to less than 10 percent per month. The task will be to  learn to pursue an industrial and social policy with a high  level of inflation.    On the whole, there should be no economic catastrophe next  year. At the same time, if 1994 does become the beginning of  stabilization (which is not very likely), the completion of this  process will take an extremely long time and can by no means be  done within a year even with the most optimistic predictions.    It is extremely likely that we will manage to stop the  decline of the standard of living of the population. Problems of  employment will be aggravated, but unemployment will not develop  to the point of a national catastrophe.    The problem of bankruptcy will definitely make itself felt  in  1994, including, probably, among enterprises that have undergone  privatization. Moreover, it is likely that some of the  bankruptcies will be caused by shortcomings and mistakes that  occurred during the period of reforms and flaws in the market  infrastructure that is being formed. It is impossible to rule  out a series of financial failures in the security market. On  the whole, 1994 will more likely show a readiness to overcome  new difficulties rather than the possibility of really "seeing  the light at the end of the tunnel."  <H3>  Yakov Urinson, Acting Minister of the Economy of the Russian  Federation, Director of the Center for Economic Market  Conditions and Prognostication under the Russian Federation  Ministry of the Economy: "The Results are Contradictory, But the  Balance Sheet Is Positive" </H3>   1. The results of the reform in 1993 are extremely  contradictory. On the one hand, the elimination of the  plan-distribution system has been completed and the process of  liberalization (of prices and domestic and foreign trade) and  privatization has continued. Goods, although they are much more  expensive, have filled the shelves of stores and wholesale  warehouses. Although the ruble has lost value, the functions of  the main means of payment in cash and noncash settlements lost  at the beginning of the reform have been restored. At the center  of public interest directives of the state plan have been  replaced by finances and budget, monetary circulation and  credit, hard currency exchange rates, and customs tariffs.    People have stably accepted the higher cost of living, the  weakening of state paternalism, and the economic instability.  Some have changed the structure of consumption and begun to  spend most of their income on food, while others have changed  their employment and found additional earnings, and still others  have entered into entrepreneurship.    After the decline of the gross domestic product by 20  percent  in 1992, in 1993 it decreased by no more than 12 percent. In  1993 investments are decreasing by 10 percent (as against 40  percent in 1992). A positive foreign trade balance is forming in  Russia (true, mainly because of a reduction of imports). After  the sharp reduction in 1992 (approximately twofold) the actual  monetary incomes at the disposal of the population this year are  expected to increase somewhat (so far only in the range of 5  percent).    But on the other hand, against the background of the already  low standard of living, there has been an increase in the  differentiation in the well-being of groups of the population at  opposite poles. There have appeared not only legal millionaires,  but also people who are officially registered as unemployed.  Certain defense plants have been left without government orders  and there has been no effective demand for the products of many  state enterprises. It has turned out to be necessary to interact  with republics of the former Soviet Union in the economic sphere  as with foreign states, that is, on a mutually advantageous  basis, and the maintenance of a ruble space without regulating  and formalizing monetary-credit relations among the countries  included in it disorganizes the economy of Russia.    In addition to this, subjective factors have manifested  themselves in a certain way as objective processes, having a  negative effect on the reformation of the economy. The "gift"  financial resources aimed at eliminating the consequences but  not the causes of the nonpayments, cheap credit for state  enterprises, subsidies for agriculture and the coal industry,  subsidization of regions, and "technical" credits for republics  of the former Soviet Union--all these served as an impediment to  the formation of a mechanism for feedback between production and  demand. Under conditions of inflation the enterprises began to  transfer their relatively free monetary funds into a consumption  fund or to apply for freely convertible currency. The former  increased the mass of money in the hands of the population and  stirred up inflation even more while the latter prompted a  decline in the exchange rate of the ruble on the foreign  currency market. The situation was exacerbated by the  unjustified social payments (higher pensions and labor  compensation in the budget sphere) and a random growth of wages  (including under pressure from strike ultimatums).    It is especially dangerous that in 1993 institutional  changes  regulating the behavior of commodity producers slowed up  drastically. As long as they do not bear real property liability  for the results of their activity and as long as unviable  enterprises of the state enterprise continue to receive support  from the budget, the inflationary process will apply more and  more pressure to the economy. The consequences of inflationary  financing of the economy: retardation of the structural  rearrangement, increased energy and material-intensiveness per  unit of GDP, growth of the budget deficit, and a new  (August-fall) cycle of inflation.    But still the overall assessment of these positive processes  and negative phenomena is clearly positive. The country will  enter 1994 with a significantly altered economy.    2. In 1994 it will be necessary to restore a strict  financial  policy on a qualitatively new level, consistently reduce the  state budget deficit to a tolerable level, and hold back the  growth of the mass of money. As calculations show, this will  make it possible to limit inflation to 500-600 percent (as  compared to 1,100 percent in 1993). By regulating the bank  interest rate at the same time it will be possible to create the  necessary preconditions for invigorating the capital market and  stimulating private savings, and in the next cycle--investments  as well. Such measures must be conducted resolutely, but in a  balanced way. It is also necessary to give a new impetus to the  process of privatization and overcome the obstacles that have  been artificially erected on its path. At the same time it is  extremely important for enterprises remaining in the state  sector of the economy to revise the legislative base for their  economic activity in reduced periods of time. The finances of  these enterprises must be clearly separated from state finances.    Within the framework of the strict restrictions that are  dictated by the requirements for financial stabilization,  support (through government orders, preferential credit, and  direct budget financing) must be given to enterprises with all  forms of ownership selected in keeping with strict criteria and  nationwide priorities.    During the course of the market transformations there will  inevitably be an increase in unemployment (in 1994 it will be  necessary to find work for about 4 million able-bodied citizens)  and an aggravation of problems of social protection. This means  payment for structural rearrangement and increased effectiveness  of the economy. The task of the federal government and local  authorities is to minimize this payment and render  special-purpose social support to segments of the population  that objectively need it, granting capable citizens the broadest  possibilities of manifesting initiative, increasing labor  productivity, and participating in entrepreneurial activity.    With the implementation of the aforementioned parts of the  economic reform in 1944 the budget deficit will decrease to an  acceptable level. The decline in production will not exceed 5-7  percent and it will assume a structural character. There will be  some increase in the incomes actually at the disposal of the  population. The population and enterprises will gradually begin  to form natural savings. With the achievement of a positive rate  of bank interest, investment activity will increase. During the  process of structural rearrangement of production there will be  new "points of growth" and within two or three years there will  be a period of stabilization of the economy in its renewed form.  <H3>  Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, Chairman of the Board of the Center for  Economic and Political Studies (EPITsENTR): "The Situation Will  Remain Difficult for Entrepreneurs" </H3>   1. On the whole the process of economic reforms was not  marked by the achievement of any significant positive results.    Inflation (the consumer price index) remained steady at the  level of 20-25 percent per month. And this is in spite of the  fact that the government made certain efforts to restrict the  growth of the mass of money (the issuance of credit,  expenditures from the state budget). Measures aimed at limiting  the aggregate demand were relatively successful. But a result of  this policy was a further decline of industrial production and  not a reduction of the rates of inflation, whose development was  generated by inflation of expenditures, against which the policy  of restricting the aggregate demand had no effect. Therefore the  Russian economy in 1993 experienced almost constant price shocks  in various sectors. In the macroeconomic sense the situation was  exacerbated also by the practice of monopolistic price setting  and the failure of the antimonopoly policy, in whose  implementation the government is experiencing many difficulties.    As compared to 1992 the decline in industrial production  slowed up (especially during June-August) but one must keep in  mind that the recession in 1992 was very severe. All government  announcements made during February-March 1993 about  stabilization of the volumes of industrial production ignored  the seasonal nature of this phenomenon and, as usual, during  May-June there is a traditional reduction of the volumes of  production, while August-September is a time of seasonal  upsurge. On the whole as compared to 1992 the decline in the  volumes of industrial production amounted to approximately 13-14  percent.    In the area of privatization of industrial enterprises the  results of the 1993 policy may be characterized by the word  "collectivization." In essence we are seeing the appearance of  enterprises that are in the hands of collective owners. The  result of this kind of privatization is obvious: great  difficulties in finding investors. For one must keep in mind  that the position of Russian industry is very  difficult--underinvestment has become extremely widespread and  the condition of the equipment in many branches is terrible and  must be replaced.    In trade, privatization has led to the creation of  monopolistic markets in many cases. These monopolies exist  because of the fact that trade enterprises are connected to the  local authorities. Hence all the "charm" of the unregulated  monopoly: price support to the detriment of the consumers,  outlays increased because of the absence of competition and a  high profit norm, sales volumes below those on the competitive  market, and closing off of access to the market for other  sellers.    In spite of the fact that in 1993 there were successes that  may be characterized as partial (a large positive trade balance  and a certain stabilization of the exchange rate of the ruble),  nonetheless for the entrepreneurial sector of the economy the  situation remains very difficult. This is largely the result of  the political uncertainty, the lack of clear guarantees for  private property, the imperfection of legislation, corruption in  all echelons of power, an increased number of crimes against  entrepreneurs, and the impossibility of engaging in business on  the basis of honest competition.    2. Government actions will have a large impact on the  condition of the economy in 1994. Nonetheless there are  macroeconomic variables that are relatively unaffected by any  actions of state power.    Under today's conditions this is primarily inflation. In  1994  it will be high as usual--high and unpredictable enough so as to  impede the development of the medium- and long-term credit  market, and this means that we have little hope of modernizing  industry relying on the mechanism of positive interest rates.    In the second place, this means a decline in industrial  production. Even according to the most optimistic version, the  slump will continue. True, apparently it will not be as deep as  in 1933, and the more so in 1992. But one should keep in mind  that even if stabilization is achieved at the end of the year  (which is not very likely), it will occur at the level of only  50 percent of the physical volume of industrial production of  1989!    A great deal depends on the policy the government pursues in  the area of demonopolization and control of monopolies and  whether or not it decides to recognize in both word and deed the  adaptation of economic institutions to the conditions of high  inflation without abandoning the cautious fight against  inflation through restricting aggregate demand, and also on the  reform of economic legislation. Within the designated framework  it is possible to have a broad choice of measures of economic  policy. And the results of 1994 could vary a great deal  depending on the decisions that are made.</p>

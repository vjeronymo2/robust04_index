			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Inchcape weak Inchcape, the vehicle distributor, continued to slide, the shares losing 17 to close at 415p. The long-term strength of the yen, which has driven up Japanese import prices, has hit Inchcape sales. Analysts forecast that the results due on September 26 will be below last year's. One leading analyst forecast pre-tax profits for the first half of Pounds 115m, down from last year's Pounds 130m, and there is City sentiment that the group may have to regain a good deal of ground in the second half. Prudential shares performed well, closing a penny up on balance at 314p after good turnover of 5.6m. The interim figures came in above most estimates and there was satisfaction with the 9 per cent increase in the dividend. Legal &amp; General lost 8 to 453p ahead of this morning's interims. P&amp;O retreated 14 to 660p on profit-taking in thin volume. Better than expected half-year profits from Associated British Ports pushed the shares up 9 to 272p. Airports group BAA put on 2 at 495p as traders digested August's strong passenger flows which, showing a rise of 6.4 per cent, have further underlined the trend to weakening market share at British Airways, where passenger volume could only gain 5.2 per cent for last month. BA dipped 4 to 393p. Eurotunnel slipped a penny to 270p, perilously near to the 265p price of May's rights issue. Shell Transport moved in the opposite direction to BP, the shares slipping 11 to 722p, with dealers noting renewed switching out of the stock and into BP, in spite of the prospect of a good interim dividend increase being announced this afternoon. Most analysts are looking for Shell to lift the interim payment by around 10 per cent. Calor Group came in for good support after revealing better than expected first-half figures. Dealers are looking for a healthy increase in the group's final dividend and the shares moved up 7 to 294p. 'A yield premium of 45 per cent is just about right for Calor, which is not a growth stock,' said one analyst. There were no shocks with Lasmo's interims, and the shares dipped 4 to 155p. British Gas failed to hold on to an early modest rise, easing to close a net 4 off at 290p ahead of tomorrow's analysts trip to Hinckley. Biotech group Celltech held steady at 206p as a huge overhang of stock was removed after the administrators of residual shareholder British &amp; Commonwealth offloaded most of its stake into the market. Celltech announced that Cazenove had placed 12.5m shares in the market at 200p each, 11m of which came from the B&amp;C administrators and took their stake down to 4.3 per cent from 19.9 per cent. Blenheim, Europe's largest conference organiser, dropped 28 to 215p after warning that tough trading in its key French market meant full-year profits would come in below budget. Media and communications group Aegis declined 2 to 30p on disappointing interims. Retailer Marks and Spencer recovered from a day's low of 402p to end a net 1 1/2 higher at 406p after bargain hunters were encouraged by elements of the latest UK inflation data. Some analysts pointed out that a 2.2 per cent gain in clothing and footwear would benefit the high street chain. They said M&amp;S had avoided much of the increase in raw materials prices by buying forward. Half-time figures from sausage skin manufacturer Devro International failed to please and the shares dropped 19 to 230p. British Aerospace stood out among a number of sharp engineering share price movements, sliding 16 to 478p in nervous trading ahead of next week's half-year results. British Steel edged ahead a half-penny to 149p against the market trend. Trading volume was a heavy 11m, with the shares acquiring something of a refuge stock tag. There were steep declines in some of the smaller market capitalisations, notably Ransomes, best known for its lawn mowers and down 7 at 57p, and controls and compressed air specialist Siebe, 15 weaker at 536p for a drop this week of 29.

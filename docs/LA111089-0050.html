			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOXING;  </P> <P> SWITCH MAKES SCORING LESS OF JUDGMENT CALL  </P> <P> The computerized scoring system introduced recently at amateur boxing's World  Championships in Moscow didn't exactly draw rave reviews, but preliminary  protests notwithstanding, the sport has probably been fundamentally changed  forever.  </P> <P> Protests over judges' scoring at the Seoul Olympics -- one decision  precipitated a riot -- put the International Amateur Boxing Federation (AIBA)  against the wall. The president of the International Olympic Committee, Juan  Antonio Samaranch told AIBA, in effect, "Clean up your act or we'll eliminate  boxing from the Olympics."  </P> <P> AIBA president Anwar Chowdhry of Pakistan decided it was time for  long-discussed computer scoring. The Soviet Union volunteered to design a  system, since it hosted last September's World Championships. And when judges  arrived in Moscow, they found a panel of switches at their desks, the two most  important of which registered scoring blows, one for the boxer in the red  corner, the other for the blue corner.  </P> <P> Their scoring during the bouts was viewed on terminal screens by the AIBA  president and the chairman of the appeals jury.  </P> <P> According to U.S. officials, the Soviet system will be improved upon by a U.S.  system.  </P> <P> "The Moscow system had a lot of problems, many of which we were able to iron  out during the tournament," said Jim Fox, executive director of the USA Amateur  Boxing Federation. "But the fact is, if we'd had even the Soviet system in  Seoul, we wouldn't have had that Roy Jones decision."  </P> <P> Jones is the U.S. middleweight deprived of a gold medal in a controversial  decision in Seoul. Another decision, which went against U.S. light-flyweight  Michael Carbajal in another gold-medal bout, was thought to have been only  slightly less outrageous by U.S. team officials.  </P> <P> "No one in Moscow was completely happy with the Soviet system, but everyone was  happy we'd taken the step," Fox said. "We're trying to find a computer company  now that will design a better system, hopefully with a four-sided display  screen above the ring so that everyone in the arena can see how a bout is being  scored during the bout."  </P> <P> That element was lacking in Moscow, where only officials seated at two ringside  tables could see the scoring.  </P> <P> Fox said he hopes that the first U.S. computer scoring system will make its  debut at Seattle's Goodwill Games next summer. No one can say if computers will  eliminate charges of biased scoring at future Olympics, but one thing is sure,  according to Fox:  </P> <P> "Computerized scoring for the Olympics and other major international amateur  boxing events is here to stay," he said.  </P> <P> Jorge Paez might have been a hit with the crowd in his Forum debut last month,  but the California Athletic Commission didn't care for his act.  </P> <P> The International Boxing Federation featherweight champion, Paez came into the  ring for his non-title fight wearing a sequined outfit that looked more suited  for a wrestling show, performed a brief dance that some interpreted as  suggestive, taunted his opponent during the fight and followed the ring-card  women around the ring between rounds.  </P> <P> Commission inspector George Yoshinaga went up on the ring apron after one  between-rounds act and told Paez to knock it off.  </P> <P> Commission President Raoul Silva of Los Angeles said Paez will attend a lecture  before his next fight here. The Forum wants to bring him back to defend his  title.  </P> <P> "If he intends to fight in California again, we'll make sure he understands  what we expect," Silva said. "There will be no obscene gestures, no carrying on  with the ring girls. He's going to sit in his corner between rounds."  </P> <P> Notice which organization among boxing's alphabet soup told Don King his  heavyweight champion, Mike Tyson, would be stripped of his title if he didn't  get cracking on a defense with everyone's No. 1 contender, Evander Holyfield?  </P> <P> Was it Jose Sulaiman, who will preach at the drop of a sanction fee that the  World Boxing Council stands for integrity in boxing? No, it was the World  Boxing Assn., which told King that if Tyson beats Razor Ruddock on Nov. 18,  Tyson will have 120 days to fight Holyfield or be stripped.  </P> <P> That directive was subsequently put aside, of course, because Tyson-Ruddock was  postponed when Tyson came down with a lung ailment. The point is, however,  while the WBA's Elias Cordova was coming down hard on King, Sulaiman was busily  moving James (Buster) Douglas from sixth to third in the WBC ratings.  </P> <P> Douglas has been designated by King as a future opponent for Tyson, and never  mind that he looked positively awful in winning a decision against Oliver  McCall on the Tyson-Carl Williams undercard.  </P> <P> Boxing Notes  </P> <P> Michael Dokes, who gave Evander Holyfield his toughest fight last February, has  signed for a Forum fight Monday against Lionel Washington. . . . Jorge Paez  defends his International Boxing Federation featherweight crown at Reno on NBC  Dec. 9 against tough Lupe Gutierrez. . . . Flyweight Michael Carbajal, biggest  surprise as a professional of the '88 U.S. Olympic team, meets Puerto Rican  Pedro Feliciano Nov. 17 in a Telemundo TV network show. If he keeps knocking  people out, Carbajal may get a flyweight title shot this summer, according to  his promoter, Bob Arum. He's 9-0 and has knocked out seven opponents.  </P> <P> Ricky Romero's state super-flyweight title fight with Martin Cardenas has been  postponed to Dec. 5 at the San Diego Sports Arena. Romero suffered a slight  neck injury while training for the original date, Nov. 2. . . .  Superstar-in-the-making: Cuba expects big things from its 17-year-old  middleweight, Ramon Garbey, since he won a world juniors championship in Puerto  Rico. The Cubans, by the way, are still steamed over several decisions at the  Moscow World Championships favoring Soviet boxers over Cubans.  </P> <P> Rick Kulis says he's serious. The Southland cable TV boxing impresario wants to  match Michael Nunn's mother, Madies Nunn, against Minna Wilson, mother of  British fighter Tony Wilson. Both moms had scrapes with the law recently --  Nunn's in Davenport, Iowa, when her son, the IBF middleweight champion, wound  up in the slammer after a scuffle with police. Wilson's mom charged into the  ring during her son's most recent bout and began whacking his opponent with her  shoe. . . . Caesars Palace will have a twin title fight show Nov. 18, Julio  Cesar Chavez-Sammy Fuentes and Julian Jackson-Troy Wortham.  </P> <P> A boxing writer wrote the following: "There are no good boxers today. At least  if there are, I have not been able to find them. . . . Boxing is a lost art. .  . . Boxing instructors who know the fine points of the game and who are  qualified to teach them to others are very scarce. During over 50 years of  experience I have known of no more than 10." The author was L.A. Times boxing  writer Frank A. Garbutt, and that's an excerpt from his column published on  Feb. 17, 1935.  </P></p>

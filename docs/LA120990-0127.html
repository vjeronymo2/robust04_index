			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREP FOOTBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> FUMBLE RETURN GIVES ARLINGTON CHAMPIONSHIP IN DIVISION IV  </P> <P> Theron Conner of Riverside Arlington picked up a fumble and ran 89 yards to  score the decisive touchdown in the Lions' 10-6 victory over Baldwin Park in  the Southern Section Division IV championship game at Ramona High Saturday  night.  </P> <P> In a defensive first half, Arlington took a 3-0 lead on a 34-yard field goal by  Ryan Bradford with 4:02 left in the second quarter.  </P> <P> Baldwin Park dominated early in the second half. The Braves drove inside  Arlington's 20-yard line before Fernando Arredondo's fumble was recovered by  Conner, who ran untouched down the Baldwin Park sideline for the score to give  the Lions a 10-0 lead.  </P> <P> "I knew that he fumbled and it was just laying there," Conner said. "The ref  even said that he was wondering when I was going to pick it up."  </P> <P> Conner's play turned out to be crucial in the fourth quarter after Baldwin  Park's Jerry Sims returned an interception to the Arlington seven-yard line,  setting up a five-yard touchdown run by Arredondo to cut the Lions' lead to  10-6.  </P> <P> Following an Arlington punt, Baldwin Park threatened late in the fourth quarter  with an 11-play, 56-yard drive that began on its own nine. But Arlington  stopped the Braves on downs to preserve the victory.  </P> <P> "We really held together as one unit at the end," Conner said. "We knew that  the game was on the line."  </P> <P> Arlington, which finishes with an 11-3 record, earned its second Southern  Section title. The Lions defeated Riverside Rubidoux, 23-8, in 1981. Baldwin  Park finished the season with a 10-3-1 record. LONNIE WHITE  </P></p>

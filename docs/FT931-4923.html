			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Arts: Back to the figurative Though one would hardly think it, to look at the artists promoted abroad by the British Council, or supported by the Tate Gallery or our other major domestic institutions, figurative painting continues to flourish to a remarkable extent in this country. By that I mean painting founded in the direct response to the visible world, to landscape, the figure and still life, as in the Beaux Arts tradition. Until a generation ago, it was the staple of all training in the fine arts, for sculptors, too, were brought up in the observation and modelling of the figure. But to speak of such things today is to speak a foreign language so far as most artists under the age of 50 are concerned. If the tradition still flourishes, it does so at the hands of artists of a certain age. Sargy Mann is in his mid-fifties, a product of the Camberwell School under the old, unreformed dispensation. He is a painter of landscape, but the landscape neither of great distances nor of particular scenes, details or effects. His subject is rather the near and middle ground: the studio interior or, as in this exhibition, the comparatively close and oddly enclosed spaces near his home at Bungay in Suffolk; the village street, footbridge and river bank, farm buildings. The wonder is that he is able to paint at all, for he is now nearly blind, with no more than peripheral vision in one eye. This is not to make allowance for the work, but to remark upon its nature. The over-coming of the disability has had a profound and clear effect upon what the work actually is, both in its process and its result. Unable to consider the subject-scene in its entirety, he is forced to examine it point by point and even to walk into it himself, to look more closely, to pace and feel and measure. And the surface of the painting is the record of this process, with its scribbled chalk notation of registration and confirmation, its loose atmospheric suggestions and the final, solid, monumental simplicity of the forms themselves: the buildings, roofs and objects by which the true pictorial space is established. The sense is of the painting never stopping, a continuous and living process, with every day a new start, from which the sense of place,lively and authentic, is teased at last. Mann's is indeed an aesthetic of process and physical commitment, quite remarkably so. Hans Schwarz is now 70, a refugee from Vienna and the Nazis before the War who has made his life in England ever since. He too is a painter of landscape, but no local loyalist, for he is as likely to be taken by the visual excitement of a zebra crossing as by the view across the Thames to St Paul's, or a French village street, or a Somerset duck-pond. He is also one of the most forceful and lively painters in water-colour at work in this country, which is not at all intended as the back-handed compliment it might seem. The conventional hierarchy of media, by which oil on canvas rates as something inherently more serious and valuable than work on paper, was always something of a nonsense. Serious artists use whatever medium and material are appropriate to their particular and immediate needs, and the portability of paper and the speed and flexibility of water-colour make their own case. Schwarz is no narrow specialist, but that his large water-colours should be so cheap is merely to make the point with a nice irony. He uses body colour to some extent, which sacrifices something of the natural luminosity of true water-colour, but he gains infinitely in the richness of his effects, both physically on the surface, and in his colour, for he is an instinctive and adventurous colourist, with his dense oranges and purples, greens and ochres. He shares this current show with the much looser, more abstracted landscape water-colours of Jenny Ryrie, a young painter from Scotland having her first proper showing in London. Ben Levene, again, is in his mid-fifties, a product of the Slade School under Coldstream, but no dot-and-carry methodist. He paints still-life, flowers in pots for the most part, and the landscape as though seen through the window, the view high across the fields to dark hills beyond. The drawing is close enough to be positively descriptive, as opposed to the merely suggestive, but a closer view shows it also to be quite crude in its sophisticated way, graphically firm and purposeful rather than more subtly accommodating. The effect is oddly emblematic, most especially in the flower pieces, a quality often reinforced by the use of a gold-leaf ground, setting the image up in an almost hieratic isolation. Presented so simply and directly, the paintings seem so much the more charged with colour, and it is indeed as a colourist that Levene is most interesting. He is no strident colourist, but within the cool range of his greens and reds, golds and blacks, he does achieve a remarkable control, the brightest viridian that is a field a mile or two away sitting quite properly in its pictorial place, keeping its distance. And with Matisse and Manet, Levene knows, what most artists do not, how rich and various a colour black can be. Sargy Mann: Cadogan Contemporary, 108 Draycott Avenue SW3, until March 27. Hans Schwarz: Thackeray Gallery, 18 Thackeray Street, Kensington Square W8, until March 26. Ben Levine: Browse &amp; Darby, 19 Cork Street W1, until March 2</p>

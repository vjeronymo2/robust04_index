			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Italicized passages recorded] </F>   [Text] The Supervision and Control Commission [CSC] met in  Maputo today. It discussed incidents at assembly areas and  freedom of movement throughout the country. At the end of the  meeting, we spoke to Deputy Minister Tomas Salomao, who headed  the government delegation.    [Salomao] The CSC approved a timetable on the closure  of assembly areas. The government intends to complete the  demobilization of its on troops on 15. [sentence as heard]  The government will decide what assembly points should be  closed down.    On the freedom of movement in Renamo [Mozambique  National Resistance] areas, yet another appeal was made to  do away with rhetoric and adopt practical solutions. We ought  to be pragmatic. Renamo leaders have already said the areas have  been opened. So citizens and election registration teams must  not face problems. As a whole, this has been a constructive and  positive session.    [Unidentified correspondent] At the end of a Cease-Fire  Commission [CCF] meeting yesterday, it was reported  that the government would confine its troops by 28 June. That  would represent an average of 700 men daily. Do you think the  government can do that?    [Salomao] It is possible. As you know, we have a  proposal in that regard. One should take into consideration  that there are assembly points in (?areas where troops are  based).    Raul Domingos, head of the Renamo delegation, says his  movement has once again reiterated its commitment to UN  resolutions on the confinement and demobilization of troops.    [Domingos] Specifically, the meeting discussed and  ratified a number of documents that had been dealt with by other  commissions -- namely, the confinement and demobilization of  troops and closure of assembly points. Renamo remains committed  to fulfilling UN resolutions in terms of which troops should be  confined by 1 June and demobilized by 15 July. All our troops  have already been confined to assembly points. Our troops will  be demobilized by 15 July [words indistinct] it is up to us to  issue the lists. So far, the names of over 3,000 men have  already been selected for demobilization.    UN Secretary General representative Aldo Ajello says the  adoption of a timetable on the closure of assembly points was an  important step in the timely completion of the peace process.    [Ajello] It has been a very positive meeting. It has  been decided to adopt a timetable [words indistinct].  The timetable sets dates for the closure of assembly  points. That is a very important step in the completion of the  peace process as scheduled.    [Correspondent] The government says it will confine its  troops by 28 June. That means the government will have to  confine 700 men daily. Do you think the government will be able  to meet the deadline?    [Ajello] It is possible. If they want to do it, then  it is possible. If logistical conditions permit, I think it  will be possible. I think the accord that has been signed  reflects a commitment to confining troops as scheduled.    Over the past weeks the commissions did not meet  because the government was meeting with its internal organs to  discuss the implementation of the last phase of the peace  process. Important decisions have been made. There is a new  element which is very positive. The process had slowed down,  but as of now we will see it moving rapidly. I think it will be  possible to comply with the timetable.    [Correspondent] The CSC session dealt with the eternal  problem of Renamo areas and the freedom of movement. What are  the developments?    [Ajello] The information we have on freedom of movement  in Renamo areas, particularly by electoral registration teams,  says Gaza Province is the only area facing problems. There are  several logistical problems -- not political problems -- in  other parts of the country. The question of Gaza Province was  discussed by the commission. I will gather all the necessary  information (?from the) Renamo delegation to settle the  dispute.</p>

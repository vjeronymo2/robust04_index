			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Details: Banks give cautious welcome BANKS AND other financial institutions gave a cautious welcome to the Autumn Statement, predicting that it would help to take some of the pressure off bank balance sheets and give a lift to trading in the securities markets. Mr Phil Nunnerley, assistant general manager for retail banking at Lloyds Bank, said the banks welcomed the government's measures to stimulate the housing market by allocating Pounds 750m for buying empty properties. He said the banks were in a better position than building societies because they had fewer repossessed properties. Mr Geoff Ellerton, product director for branch banking at Midland, said the cut in base rates would make saving less attractive. The banks were already noticing a downward pressure on savings accounts, which could lead to increased consumer spending. Securities houses looked forward to continuing interest in equities - and thus higher commissions - from falling UK interest rates.</p>

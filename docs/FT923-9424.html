			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / Hurd backs UN chief as 'man of stature' THE British government yesterday publicly expressed its support of Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the United Nations secretary-general, who has been the subject of critical articles in the press, particularly in the UK. Mr Boutros Ghali, a former senior Egyptian diplomat, who has recently been involved in an open dispute with the UN Security Council and Lord Carrington, the chairman of the European Community's peace conference on Yugoslavia, suggested in an interview that racism might be at the root of the criticism directed at him. 'Maybe it's because I'm a wog,' he told the New York Times. Ignoring the allegation of racism, Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, said on radio yesterday that Mr Boutros Ghali was 'a man of stature and style.' 'I reckon he's going to be a very effective secretary-general. He's taking over at a time when the UN is having to face great burdens. The queue of trouble outside his door grows all the time. I'm not surprised that he feels occasional exasperation, but we are on his side and we will work with him.' It is not the first time Mr Hurd has attempted to placate Mr Boutros Ghali. Last month, he made an unscheduled stop in New York on his way to Manila after the UN secretary-general had complained about not being properly consulted on an EC request for UN monitoring of heavy weapons in Bosnia. Mr Boutros Ghali said the UN did not have the resources to carry out such a task and accused the international community of showing more concern about 'the rich man's war' in former Yugoslavia, than the humanitarian disaster in Somalia. Though the secretary-general appears to feel that Britain and its permanent UN ambassador, Sir David Hannay, are primarily responsible for critical articles about him in the British press, adverse comment has not been confined to the UK. Members of several UN delegations have been taken aback by what some consider to be the secretary-general's aloof style and his preference for going over their heads to deal with members of governments directly. Nor is his penchant for calling a spade a spade appreciated by practitioners of a profession dedicated to a more circumlocutory mode of expression. Behind the whole affair lies an obvious conflict of priorities in the UN. Developing countries consider Mr Boutros Ghali should be devoting more UN resources to Third World problems instead of Yugoslavia. That causes stresses in an organisation already grossly over-stretched, which are reflected in the attitude and manner of its top executive official. Editorial Comment, Page 12</p>

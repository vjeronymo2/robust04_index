			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / The Long View: Getting high on drugs they beat the stock market. It is a trick far more often claimed than achieved. If you look at the performance figures published by Caps, a firm which measures the investment returns of pension funds, you will find that the median return on UK equities in 1992 was 22.4 per cent whereas the return on the All-Share Index was 20.6 per cent. Over ten years, however, these pension funds have only performed just about in line with the All-Share, and have underperformed foreign equity markets by about 2 per cent a year. Have fund managers at last got their act together? In fact it looks as though their gains resulted from favourable patterns in the market rather than from bursts of new inspiration. There are detailed explanations, one of which is the pharmaceuticals effect. Briefly, Glaxo and Wellcome together account for a significant percentage of the aggregate value of UK equities (about 5 1/2 per cent at the end of 1992, down from 7 per cent 12 months earlier). They have a detectable influence upon the UK market indices but many of their shares are owned by foreigners or in Wellcome's case by the Wellcome Foundation. In the jargon, UK investment institutions tend to be underweight in pharmaceuticals. It follows that when drugs shares are strong the British fund managers mostly fail to keep up with the market indices, but when Glaxo and Wellcome tumble, as they did in 1992, and have continued to do in 1993 so far, British fund managers can hardly help beating the market. If you meet a fund manager he may prefer to describe this effect more positively but opaquely as 'stock selection' or 'sector rotation'. In fund management things are rarely quite what they seem. Investors spend too much time chasing the impossible and too little pursuing achievable, if duller, objectives. Such thoughts are stimulated by a re-reading of Charles Ellis's book Investment Policy: How to Win the Loser's Game, in its new US-published second edition. Although Ellis, a top US investment services consultant, originally wrote the book for a professional audience he has added a chapter for private investors. He says, for instance, do not add up your wealth more than three or four times a year or you may get too caught up with what the crowd are doing. Choosing stocks to beat the market is the classic case of hope triumphing over experience. Between 1970 and 1990 over 75 per cent of professionally managed funds in the US underperformed the broad measure of the US stock market, the S &amp; P 500. Of course, some managers appear to do well: over the past five years the best UK pension fund managers have outperformed the average fund by about 3 per cent a year. But will they do so over the next five years? It would be very surprising. Fund managers have manoeuvred themselves into the strange position of offering almost guaranteed disappointment. Other professionals do not fall into this trap: your doctor and lawyer do not promise to beat their peers, just that they will do a competent job. But the competent fund manager who does an average job will underperform his over-ambitious benchmark and will eventually be sacked. The only reliable way to achieve higher returns is to invest in higher-risk assets - in equities, say, rather than fixed interest bonds, or bank deposits. But this only works in the long run. And it only works if you can tolerate a sudden market setback without being forced to sell at the bottom. British pension funds are valued on a smoothed-out actuarial basis, and can accept a lot of risk, so can have a high equity exposure. US funds are valued at market prices, are less risk-tolerant and must therefore have a high proportion of fixed interest securities. Thus, creating the right framework is much more important in the long run than picking an ace investment manager who promises to perform better than all the others (he may well produce some historical figures to back up his claims). Risk is often ill-understood by professional investors, let alone by amateurs. Private investors live in dread of another 1987 crash, although from a long-run perspective Black Monday's collapse was just one of those temporary misfortunes which must be expected from time to time. Retail investment institutions are currently doing a roaring trade in guaranteed products which offer downside protection against a stock market setback. Often these make ingenious use of the futures markets. But is there really any point? The market pays equity investors to accept risk. These fancy products often lose four or five points of gross annual return, of the same order as the extra return available on equities compared with bonds. Moreover there are early surrender penalties, plus an unquantifiable risk that the guaranteed returns will not actually be delivered because of market failures in a crisis, as happened in the US with so-called 'portfolio insurance' during the 1987 crash. It might be better to opt for lower-risk non-equity products in the first place. Private investors, Ellis points out, also usually fail to understand the risks involved in high stock market valuations. For the long-term investor it is best that share prices stay low, so that the future stream of dividends can be bought more cheaply. However, private punters prefer to buy into a rising market which creates a glow of prosperity but offers poorer and poorer value. On the other hand they shun a weak stock market even though it offers greater future rewards. It is, of course, difficult to avoid mixing up short-term valuations with long-term objectives: we all like to make a quick paper profit. In any case, your friendly fund manager will generously offer to take your money and beat the market for you. After all, look at what he did last year . . .</p>

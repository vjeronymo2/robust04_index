The Russian diplomat admitted, however, that Moscow has not  officially refused to pull out its troops.    Churkin said the Russian Foreign Ministry has adopted a new  tactical line, that of ignoring Baltic diplomats' critical  statements. "At the recent sessions of the Council of Europe  Security Council and the North Atlantic Cooperation Council  (Russian Foreign Minister Andrey) Kozyrev didn't say a word  about his Baltic colleagues, although we don't see eye to eye  with them on a number of issues, including observance of human  rights," he said.    Churkin assured that, as an official in charge of relations  with the Baltic states at the Russian Foreign Ministry, he has  "no evil intentions" with regard to those countries, and  promised to do his best in seeking concrete solutions to the  problems that have cropped up.</p>

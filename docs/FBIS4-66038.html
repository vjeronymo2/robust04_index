			<p>BFN     [Text] Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis today  stressed that the Cypriot Government will not negotiate the  confidence-building measures. He said this week was  disappointing because the UN secretary general -- unjustifiably  -- did not submit his report to the Security Council. The  spokesman added: Butrus-Ghali now has the report to finalize  and it is up to him to decide.    Referring to Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas' actions,  the spokesman said they are part of his delaying tactics. He  concluded: He is making fun of the UN secretary general and the  Security Council.</p>

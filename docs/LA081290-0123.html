			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> IN AFRICA, DEMOCRATIC SYSTEMS OF GOVERNMENT SLOWLY REPLACING PERSONALITY CULTS  </P> <P> When a new member of the parliament called President Robert Mugabe "the only  other Son of God," Mugabe joined a galaxy of African leaders who have been  showered with fanciful honorifics.  </P> <P> Mugabe already had been dubbed "the most authentic, consistent and  revolutionary leader" in the ruling ZANU PF Party's newspaper advertisements.  </P> <P> His Kenyan counterpart, Daniel Arap Moi, is known as "The Glorious" (Mheshimiwa  in Swahili). The octogenarian Hastings Kamuzu Banda is "The Lion of Malawi" or  "Savior" (Mkango waMalawi or Ngwazi in the native Nyanja.)  </P> <P> Praise-singing, once an important feature of the reverence accorded to African  rulers, is being challenged more and more by a critical public demanding  political freedom.  </P> <P> For placing Mugabe on a par with Jesus Christ, Tony Gara was accused of  professional sycophancy and blasphemy. Angry letters to the local press  denounced him for saying that "(Zimbabwe) and its people should thank the  Almighty for giving us his only other Son -- by the name of Robert Gabriel  Mugabe."  </P> <P> The local Catholic magazine Moto protested that Zimbabwe did not need a  personality cult such as that supporting North Korea's President Kim Il Sung,  who is known as the Great Leader.  </P> <P> According to Jonathan Moyo, a University of Zimbabwe political science lecturer  and outspoken critic of Mugabe, the bestowing of accolades on leaders is a  precolonial African tradition.  </P> <P> "Traditional chiefs in precolonial societies enjoyed these praises as they  sought to build centralized structures of authority and coercion. Some of the  leaders who inherited power at independence have continued to rule like  chiefs," Moyo said.  </P> <P> "Because most African countries are colonially created states, hero worshiping  . . . has always been justified on grounds of consolidating nationhood. That is  where you get that concept of one country, one leader."  </P> <P> Many of the attributes heaped on African leaders by their subjects compare  their powers to those of God or of a dangerous animal.  </P> <P> President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire rules under the self-proclaimed title "The  one who is and shall always be," derived from a name he gave himself in the  1960s, Kuku Ngbengu Wasa Banga.  </P> <P> "God the Almighty is an attractive comparison, because he expects absolute  loyalty and obedience," Moyo said.  </P> <P> Banda has suppressed all opposition since he came to power in 1964. Officials  insist that he be addressed as "Ngwazi, His Excellency the Life President,  Mkango waMalawi, Dr. Kamuzu Banda."  </P> <P> When Banda is seated, his chief of protocol kneels to address him. Malawians  must invoke Kamuzu's name in all official statements.  </P> <P> On a trip to Malawi early this year, Banda gave Mugabe a leopard skin, a symbol  of power in Africa.  </P> <P> No recent African leader has followed the example of the Central African  Republic's Jean-Bedel Bokassa, who declared himself emperor in the 1970s.  </P> <P> Moyo said the habit of hero worshipping is fading: "The ordinary man is now  aware that once he treats his political leader like a traditional chief, the  leader wants to hold onto power till death."  </P> <P> It is not just the titles that have lost their appeal. African symbols of power  worn by some leaders, mostly postcolonial nationalists of the 1950s and 1960s,  are also under scrutiny.  </P> <P> Mobutu's trademark is a leopard-skin hat. Banda carries a fly whisk; Moi sports  a short staff. President Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia is never without a white  handkerchief in his hand.  </P> <P> Moi's predecessor and Kenya's first president, Jomo Kenyatta, also carried a  fly whisk.  </P> <P> Some younger African leaders have managed without the titles and symbols, among  them Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, Mozambique's Joaquim Chissano  and presidents Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and Ali Hassan Mwinyi of Tanzania.  </P> <P> "Public respect for praise names and power symbols is declining as fast as the  pressure for democracy on the continent is building," said Chengatai Malumo of  the University of Zimbabwe.  </P></p>

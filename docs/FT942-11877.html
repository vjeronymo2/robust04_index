			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Western Cape will prosper, says Kriel Mr Hernus Kriel, who will head a National party government in South Africa's Western Cape province, believes most money in any post-apartheid economic boom will be attracted to his administration, Reuter reports from Cape Town. Mr Kriel, law and order minister in the the outgoing white parliament, said in an interview that investors would be drawn to the Cape by his commitment to law and order and by the white-led NP's commitment to a free market. 'People will invest where they feel their property and profits are safe,' said Mr Kriel, who is likely to be the only white provincial premier. Mr Kriel dismissed speculation that the Cape could become a white homeland or volkstaat, but he said investors would be drawn by the stability of NP rule following the repeal of anti-apartheid sanctions that deepened the country's four-year recession. Economic analysts said, however, that growth would be due to the natural advantages of the Cape. Mr David Bridgman of Wesgro, a regional economic initiative, said the Cape was already the country's most attractive venue for new manufacturing investment. 'There is a threat - and it would be very bad news  - that we could face a race with the National party going all out to make the Western Cape work and the ANC going all out to prove it a disaster,' he said. 'There is already a perception of the Cape as being high on lifestyle and low on violence, which is attracting a lot of people.' Mr Rob Lee, Board of Executors portfolio manager, said Mr Kriel would have only limited powers to put the Western Cape on a different economic course from the policy adopted by the central government. However, 'the National party will want to make the Cape its showcase, so they'll put everything into making it look better than the rest of the country.' He said South Africa's post-apartheid growth would be fuelled by tourism and manufactured exports and the Western Cape was favourably placed to take advantage of both.</p>

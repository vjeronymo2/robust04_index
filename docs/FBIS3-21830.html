Governor Ernesto Ruffo Appel said that authorities are  searching for Higuera Guerrero, a lieutenant of the Arellano  Felix brothers, well-known drug trafficking bosses in the city  of Tijuana, for his involvement in a shoot-out on 3 March in  which four people were killed. The Baja California governor did  not mention the amount of the reward, which will be discussed at  the state's congress.    The Attorney General's Office [PGR] said yesterday that the  best U.S. and Mexican narcotics agents will be part of a special  group to fight drug trafficking activities on the border between  the countries, where tons of drugs circulate.    Ruffo pointed out that Higuera is a key element in the  shoot-out that took place between federal and state agents in a  Tijuana shopping center, which resulted in four persons being  killed, including Alejandro Castaneda, chief of the Federal  Judicial Police [PJF]. Five agents were also injured in the  incident.    According to the PGR, the shoot-out occurred when state  agents and a Lebanese gunman were providing protection to Ismael  Higuera Guerrero, well-known drug trafficking boss from that  border city. The PGR added that the incident took place when  members of the State Judicial Police (PJE) were escorting Ismael  Higuera Guerrero, alias El Mayel, in a vehicle.    The PJF, which is investigating the activities of the  Tijuana  Cartel, initiated the pursuit of a vehicle in which El Mayel was  allegedly traveling, which led the state judicial agents to  shoot at the federal agents.    The Lebanese gunman, an unidentified man, Castaneda, and a  PJE member who was protecting the alleged drug trafficker, were  killed in the shoot-out.    The PGR said that the assistant state attorney general,  Sergio Ortiz Lara, and the state prosecutor for special affairs  were arrested by the federal authorities for their alleged  responsibility in the incidents. According to the PGR, Ortiz  ordered the federal agents to turn over to him one of the  alleged drug traffickers, who was arrested following the  shoot-out but was later released.    Even though Ortiz claims he is innocent, the PGR has  denounced the involvement of certain state judicial police  members with the drug traffickers, which could explain why the  Arellano Felix brothers have not been arrested yet. Governor  Ruffo Appel said he believes Ortiz is innocent because he says  he has known him since childhood and he had no reason to get  involved in drug trafficking activities.</p>

			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Italy extends privatisation plan THE Italian government's privatisation plans are more sweeping than first announced, according to Prof Guiseppe Guarino, the new industry minister. The government has set no limit on the shareholdings in individual companies that can be sold to private investors, he told the Financial Times yesterday. But the government is limiting to 45 per cent the stakes to be sold off in two special holdings - containing the assets of the state industrial and financial entities brought under the wing of the Treasury as a result of last Friday's emergency budget. 'Since last Friday, we are now thinking differently,' he said. The public sector deficit meant the state could not bail out industry and even if it could this was against Italy's commitments to the EC, he added. As at Monday, the following concerns have come under the control of the Treasury and have become joint stock companies; IRI, the main state holding company; ENI, the state oil company; ENEL, the electricity authority; and INA, the insurance institute. IRI, ENI and ENEL employ 650,000 people and have a combined turnover of nearly L160,000bn (Pounds 70.3bn), with debts close to L80,000bn. The Treasury under Mr Piero Barucci, a former banker, will be responsible for financial control and the Ministry of Industry for industrial strategy. However, the team co-ordinating privatisation includes the Christian Democrat and former finance minister, Mr Giovanni Goria, and Prof Franco Reviglio at the budget ministry. Mr Reviglio is a former finance minister and head of ENI. Within the next two weeks the government will create two 'mother holdings'. These will combine the four joint stock companies plus the Treasury's holdings in the commercial bank, BNL, and the banking and finance group, IMI. It will be decided this week whether the holdings will be divided between industry and financial interests. Much depends on whether IRI's controlling interests in the banks Comit, Banca di Roma and Crediop are hived off. But the aim is to have the total assets, provisionally estimated at L60,000bn, in broadly similar quantities in each of the two holdings. Prof Guarino insists they will be debt free but it has yet to decide how to treat existing liabilities. Before the end of 1992, the two new holdings will issue bonds to be underwritten by a consortium of banks. These should be convertible into shares with tax incentives on a sliding scale. Private stakes in the holdings will be limited to 45 per cent. But Prof Guarino insists there is no limit on the percentage of shares to be sold in subsidiaries. This will be determined by the companies themselves. A possible administrator of the two 'mother holdings' is Prof Romano Prodi, former head of IRI but the government recognises the private sector will be sceptical as long as the state keeps a controlling interest. Prof Guarino accepts that many of the state companies are under-capitalised. and fresh capital can only come from the domestic and international markets. A significant constraint will be the ability of the domestic market to absorb some L12,000bn a year of privatisations. The heads of IRI, ENI and ENEL have welcomed the measures, although previously strong supporters of public sector enterprise. If market criteria are to prevail it is unlikely that the politicised boards of the companies can remain as before. The boards have also reflected the dictates of the main political parties. Unlike previous industry ministers, Prof Guarino rejects the idea of strategic sectors. He says the single European market and increased competition have rendered this outdated. In a remarkable turnround for a government which previously viewed Sir Leon Brittan, the EC competition commissioner, as a scourge, Prof Guarino claims: 'We ought to be thankful to Mr Brittan because he has made us realise we have to change'.</p>

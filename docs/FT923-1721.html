			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Yard denies 'dirty tricks' reports SCOTLAND YARD last night denied reports that it believed MI5, the security service, was behind a 'dirty tricks' campaign over the leak at the weekend of the appointment of Commander David Tucker as the new head of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist branch. The appointment was planned months ago as part of a reorganisation of the security operations against IRA units active on the mainland, spearheaded by Ms Stella Rimington, the MI5 chief, according to police sources. It was not, Scotland Yard said, a way of hastening the retirement of Commander George Churchill-Coleman. 'There is no MI5 dirty tricks behind this,' it said. The move came amid fears that any public escalation of a row between Scotland Yard and MI5 might be exploited by the IRA. However, anger within Scotland Yard continued to be widespread yesterday at the way the leaking had in effect forestalled any chance of an uncontroversial succession, due to take place in November, to one of the most sensitive public posts in the country. According to one Scotland Yard official, the Home Office was under pressure to identify those responsible for the leak, while Mr Churchill-Coleman was said to be 'furious' at the way the announcement of his departure has been pre-empted by the media. In spite of official denials, Mr Brian Hilliard, editor of the usually well-informed magazine Police Review, said that the 'grassroots' feeling within the force was that Mr Churchill-Coleman had been moved 'at the request of MI5'. Mr Tucker was avoiding the public eye yesterday, hoping that the controversy would eventually subside and allow him to get on with the job he has apparently been groomed for behind the scenes. Officially, Scotland Yard's SO11, the unit he has headed for the past two years, has focused on non-terrorist criminal activity. But it emerged yesterday that the unit has also been closely involved in covert anti-IRA operations. It is that activity which has reportedly earned Commander Tucker a good reputation among senior officials of MI5. It also became clear yesterday that Commander Tucker had accepted the post as head of the anti-terrorist branch in preference to an appointment linked to Europol, the planned European intelligence agency which is due to become operative in January. He has experience of liasing with other European police agencies as a former head of Scotland Yard's Interpol unit. The very nature of SO11 has meant that Commander Tucker has been one of the least well-known senior officers in the Metropolitan Police. Close colleagues of Commander Tucker say that he owes his relatively rapid promotion to a proven track record as a skilled operator in surveillance work and as a conciliator between the various agencies involved in anti-terrorist work.</p>

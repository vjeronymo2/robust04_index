			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WESTERN DIGITAL, IBM WILL SHARE TECHNOLOGIES  </P> <P> Western Digital said Wednesday that it has signed a cross-license patent  agreement with International Business Machines Corp. that will give the Irvine  computer products company access to a broad range of IBM technology.  </P> <P> Under the agreement, Western Digital will pay undisclosed royalties to IBM for  the right to use IBM technology for five years in products such as computer  chips, disk and video controllers and computer circuit boards. Western Digital  will be licensing its technology to IBM as well.  </P> <P> "We are pleased to have reached this agreement with IBM because it further  strengthens our relationship with this important industry leader," said Roger  W. Johnson, chairman, president and chief executive of Western Digital. "The  agreement gives us access to IBM's extensive patent portfolio and includes  patents covering leading process and product technologies in the semiconductor  and computer industries."  </P> <P> Financial terms for the deal were not disclosed.  </P> <P> Western Digital stock closed Wednesday at $12.375 a share, up 37.5 cents, in  American Stock Exchange trading, continuing the stock's recent bull run on Wall  Street.  </P> <P> IBM, which is based in White Plains, N.Y., has a reputation for tough  enforcement of its patent rights, but it has been aggressively pursuing  licensing agreements with suppliers since the summer of 1987. Robert Blair, a  Western Digital spokesman, said the agreement was not reached under threat of  litigation. He added that payments to IBM will not have a material impact on  his company's earnings.  </P> <P> Wall Street analysts welcomed the agreement, saying that a cooperative  relationship between IBM and Western Digital bodes well for both companies.  </P> <P> "This kind of agreement is becoming typical in the industry," said analyst  Steve Ossad with Montgomery Securities in San Francisco, "and it's consistent  with an improved business relationship."  </P> <P> Raj Rajaratnam, analyst with Needham &amp; Co. in New York, said that the  agreement signals a close working relationship between IBM and Western Digital  that could enhance Western Digital's prowess in the technology marketplace.  </P> <P> He also said the license agreement reinforces the rumor circulating on Wall  Street that IBM has granted Western Digital a major contract to supply parts  for a notebook-size laptop computer that IBM is expected to announce that it  will make. Both Western Digital and IBM have declined to comment on the rumor.  </P> <P> However, Mark Matheson, an analyst with Cruttenden &amp; Co. in Newport Beach,  cautioned that the license agreement by itself is not an indication that  Western Digital has won the contract to supply parts for the IBM laptop or that  that contract would be lucrative.  </P> <P> Rajaratnam said Western Digital's strategy for becoming a broad supplier of  parts and systems for personal-computer makers is coming together. He said the  company has strong product lines in its "intelligent" disk drives, storage  controllers and communications offerings.  </P> <P> Western Digital will report its earnings for the third quarter on April 20,  Blair said. contracts  </P></p>

			<p>Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by KRASNAYA ZVEZDA correspondent Sergey Knyazkov </F> under the "Events and Comments" rubric: "Explosion Occurred  After Midnight"; first paragraph is KRASNAYA ZVEZDA introduction]    [Text]  <H5>  Who Benefits from Skrunda Radar Station Sabotage? </H5>   As reported in the 2 March edition of KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, on 28  February a concrete support of a 110-kilovolt power transmission  line was destroyed by an explosion occurring in Ranskaya Volost  of Latvia, 5 kilometers from the Skrunda Radar Station. This  high-voltage line supplies the Skrunda Radar Station with power.    According to Edgar Birkans, director of high-voltage  networks, power transmission from Brotseny was cut off at 00.25  just after midnight on 28 February due to a damaged support. The  RLS [radar station] was not affected, however, since it is  provided with its own standby power system. The installation is  supplied with power via two high-voltage networks emanating from  Brotseny and Tukus. The damage was found during a morning  troubleshooting foot tour. Birkans states that the damage, which  affects only Latvia, is estimated to exceed 4,000 lats.    The scene of the occurrence was inspected by a commission  consisting of representatives of Latvenergo, Latvian criminal  police, and the Skrunda Radar Station. According to the Press  Center of the SZGV [Northwestern Troop Grouping], SZGV Commander  Colonel General Leonid Mayorov discussed the incident with  Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis. A letter requesting an  investigation of the incident was sent to Yanis Skrastinsh,  general prosecutor of Latvia.    Laymonis Liyepinsh, chief of Criminal Investigation of the  Police Department, said the occurrence will be investigated by  the Kuldigskiy Rayon Prosecutor's Office. Bomb specialists have  been dispatched from Riga. In addition, the Ministry of Defense  and ZEMESSARGA is conducting a separate investigation. Their job  of apprehending the offenders will not be an easy one.    Laymonis Liyepinsh considers that a political flavor  attaches  to the explosion. At a 1 March press conference, representatives  of the Tevzemey uk Brivibay, the nationalistic faction of the  Latvian Sejm, were unanimous in describing the incident as a  "provocation with far-reaching consequences." At the same time,  Mr. Yakobson, consultant to the faction, went a step further by  saying that "the explosion was arranged by Russia, or at least  by those who stand behind her or wish to help her." Well, this  sounds like the same old tune: Laying the blame on someone else.  As for the explosion, the SZGV Press Center actually made a  statement in the Latvian newspapers to the effect that the  commission inspecting the scene has arrived at the official  conclusion that the damage caused the transmission line  constitutes an act of sabotage.    Finally, Latvian specialists performed a very rapid,  high-quality job restoring the damaged transmission line support.</p>

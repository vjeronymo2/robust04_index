It has also been learned that reduction or abolition of tariff  and customs duties on certain items decided to be traded under  this arrangement has not been done, although the time limit  fixed for this purpose has already expired. Diplomatic sources  said that Pakistan did not attend several meetings of the  committee formed to finalize the structure of the SAPTA. On one  such occasion, Pakistan said that it was unable to attend the  meeting as it was busy with the general elections and added that  the government of Prime Minister Moin Qureshi cannot make any  decision on SAPTA as it is a caretaker government. After the  election of Benazir Bhutto as prime minister, another meeting of  the SAPTA committee was held in Sri Lanka last November.  Pakistan abstained from attending this meeting also but did not  give any reason for it. Diplomatic sources said that the  government of Benazir Bhutto believes that if the SAPTA accord  is implemented then Indian products will capture the markets of  the SAARC [South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]  member countries. Apart from this, Pakistan is not interested  in SAPTA, as it has found markets for its products in the West  and Central Asian countries following the launching of the  Economic Cooperation Organization [ECO]. For this reason,  Pakistan is gradually losing its interest in SAPTA.    A Foreign Ministry source, who preferred to remain  anonymous,  disclosed that Pakistan was never interested in SAPTA. It has  just complied with the requests made by other SAARC member  countries to agree to the formation of the SAPTA. During the  last SAARC summit held in Dhaka so many differences surfaced  over the proposal for the launching of this trading forum that  it was about to be dropped. The SAARC foreign ministers failed  to reach a consensus on the issue. Later, the leaders of the  SAARC countries who came to Dhaka to attend the summit managed  to convince Pakistan to agree to the launching of the SAPTA  during their river cruise on the Buriganga River in Dhaka.    However, after the SAARC summit, several countries,  including  Iran, Pakistan, Turkey, Afghanistan, and the newly emerged  Muslim states of the former Soviet Union, took up large-scale  programs for greater economic cooperation among them. As a  result, Pakistan gradually became more inclined toward the ECO.  It has been learned from a reliable source that the Iranian  foreign minister during his visit to Dhaka last year invited  Bangladesh to join the ECO, but it refused to accept the  proposal.    It has been reported that when talks were being held in  Dhaka  regarding formulating the draft of the SAPTA, some of the  members pointed out the economic disparity among the countries  of the region. They cited that the level of economic and  technological development was not the same in these countries,  as the gap was very wide. Pakistan and India are at par, taking  into consideration the economic growth rate and technological  development in these two countries, but the level of economic  development in the other SAARC member countries including  Bhutan, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Maldives is much below that of  India and Pakistan. Bangladesh has nothing to trade with these  two countries. Observers feel that the over-enthusiasm of  Bangladesh to maintain its South Asian identity will make it  totally dependent on India.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Dividing Lines" column by Samir Rajab] </F>   [Text] What happened yesterday over the regions that are  under international protection in northern Iraq is very  embarrassing for the United States, which is trying to appear to  the whole world as the sole holder of all the keys to modern  technology.    Is it possible that U.S. fighter planes downed U.S.  helicopters?    Frankly, had such an incident taken place in a Third World  country, the United States would have screamed and shouted,  cried and mourned over the souls of the victims who are  worthless and priceless.    If the catastrophe had been the fault of a state other than  the United States, the world would have been up in arms.  Washington would have called for a Security Council meeting and  demanded the international community's intervention to punish  the wrongdoer, even if the mistake had been committed  unintentionally.    There are numerous examples of this kind of U.S. behavior.  However, because the United States is the one who made the  mistake, the issue will not go beyond forming a committee that  will look into the circumstances and justifications of the  incident.    Of course, Britain also reacted calmly to the catastrophe,  despite the fact that it lost two of its officers working with  the UN forces. But it is a friendship that cannot be forfeited  very easily. To put it another way, Britain was afraid of U.S.  anger if it protested the incident and accused the United States  of negligence.    On the other hand, Iraq quickly issued a statement in which  it denied involvement in the incident so that it could avert  further sanctions that might have been imposed on its people,  but this time for no reason.    At any rate, with every passing day there is further  evidence  that the aura with which the United States surrounds itself,  thanks to its famous and distinctive media, does not agree with  reality. Once again I repeat that had the incident been caused  by any other country, demonstrations would have erupted in the  whole world condemning the backward people who fail to use the  inventions of our age and do not appreciate the value of a life.</p>

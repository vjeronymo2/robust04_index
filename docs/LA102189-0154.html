			<p><P> October 21, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NORTHWEST;  </P> <P> BUENA PARK;  </P> <P> WORKERS BURNED IN POWER LINE ACCIDENT  </P> <P> Firefighters rescued two workers who were injured by a jolt of electricity from  a power line while working on the roof of a one-story Buena Park building  Friday.  </P> <P> The workers were painting on the roof of the KDI Composite Technology building  in the 6000 block of 8th Street when an extension pole they were holding struck  the 440-volt incoming power line, a Buena Park fire spokesman said.  </P> <P> "The surge (of current) through the pole burned the palms of their hands and  their fingers and knocked at least one of them to the ground," said Buena Park  Battalion Chief Donald Tully.  </P> <P> Norberto Angiano, 35, and Miguel Contraras, 38, suffered second- and  third-degree burns on their hands, Tully said. Contraras also suffered burns on  his side and abdomen.  </P> <P> KDI employees who heard the men's screams for help called the Buena Park Fire  Department about 9.30 a.m. Firefighters used an aerial platform and a hydraulic  basket to lower the injured men from the roof. The men were then taken to the  UCI Medical Center burn unit. Tully described their condition as satisfactory.  </P></p>

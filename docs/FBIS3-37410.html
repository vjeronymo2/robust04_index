			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Yan Ulanskiy report in the "Scandal" column: "Divorce in </F> the Family of V.V. Zh.," with commentary by Mikhail Shchipanov]    [Text] Speaking at a State Duma plenary session yesterday,  Viktor Kobelev, who was number two on the Liberal Democratic  Party [LDPR] slate, announced his disagreement with the ways of  V.V. Zh. [Zhirinovskiy], as well as his decision to leave the  faction. He was joined by another LDPR member, Aleksandr Pronin.    V.V. Zh. would not put up with such an escapade from his  associates, saying that the "scoundrels and scumbags Kobelev and  Pronin have already been expelled from the party and the  election slate for conduct impermissible for a deputy, and also  for criminal offenses."    Kobelev, however, dismissed these accusations as false,  noting that if V.V. Zh. does not calm down, he (Kobelev) would  match each of these strikes with ten. "I remain in the LDPR  Supreme Council because the question of my expulsion may be  decided only by a party congress." Nonetheless, Kobelev has not  so far decided whether he will create his own faction with his  supporters in the LDPR, stressing, however, that many of them  are ready to follow his suit and leave V.V. Zh.'s faction.  According to Kobelev, V.V. Zh.'s extremist tricks, unauthorized  by the LDPR congress, do not fit into the party program or  rules. Therefore in the very near future one can expect not  only the disintegration of the Zhirinovskiy faction, but also a  split within the LDP.  <H5>  Afterword </H5>   The departure of two dissident liberals can be the thin end  of a wedge that bodes no good for Zhirinovskiy. Indeed, there  is nothing sensational in the mere fact of factional desertion:  there have been plenty of precedents while small factions and  groups, anxious to expand their base, are dead set against the  principle: either you are loyal to your party commitment in the  State Duma, or put your membership card down on the table.  Moreover, to V.V. Zh.'s shame and humiliation, there is no  mechanism for recalling a deputy. And therefore all of his  threats to throw the fugitive out into the street are just as  menacing as this promise to send five Russian divisions to the  Balkans.    It is another matter that the great leader envisioned his  "flock of falcons" lining up solidly behind him, and now this  nuisance. Why? Have they finally seen the light? But this is  simply ridiculous: Don't V.V. Zh.'s closest associates already  know his true colors? This "recovery of sight," however, can be  other than ideological. The people who have come into  parliament on the LDP slate have been rumored to express their  discontent with V.V. Zh.'s insufficient clout in distributing  parliamentary posts and portfolios: apparently he has secured  too few comfortable chairs in committees and subcommittees for  his associates. Obviously, trust in Zhirinovskiy's omnipotence  has been shaken. Moreover, some of his followers began to  realize that in the leader's shadows one can easily catch a  cold. At the same time, it was clear that the first person to  challenge Zhirinovskiy on his own turf could immediately emerge  from obscurity into the limelight, launching his own  parliamentary career with a noisy scandal which has attracted  the attention of the press and colleagues.    The design is fairly accurate. It is only that it speaks  about the true motives of Zhirinovskiy's "falcons" a little too  plainly.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik and Deputy </F> Prime Minister Roman Kovac by Robert Matejovic; place and date  not given: "Are We Going to Cut Ourselves Off From the European  Future?"]    [Text] On 23 April there will be a merging congress of the  Alliance of Democrats of the Slovak Republic and the Platform  for Political Realism. Following the congress, a new political  entity should be established--the Democratic Union of Slovakia.  We are going to discuss with Slovak Prime Minister Moravcik and  Deputy Minister Roman Kovac certain aspects that proceeded this  process. Both men also represent the leadership of the Platform  of Political Realism.    [Matejovic] Both entities are supporting liberal ideas. Why  is the new party not going to assume a name like the Liberal  Party or the National Liberal Party? What is the Democratic  Union of Slovakia?    [Moravcik] We have been contemplating for a long time what  name to give to the newly established political entity. We have  based our considerations on the fact that liberalism may not  have strong traditions in Slovakia but is needed because it  corresponds, to a certain extent, to the centrist thinking of  the Slovaks who do not like extreme positions. We were afraid,  however, that, if we called the entity "Liberal Party," people  would not understand us. We want to convince people by  implementing our policy program and not impress them by our  name. We believe that in Slovakia we still have to constantly  stress the democratic nature of the institutions we establish  and that they are in harmony with the liberal program. This is  why we, too, had to put the adjective "democratic" in the name  of our union.    [Kovac] We have founded the Democratic Union of Slovakia as  a party of the center. We were slightly inspired by the French  Democratic Union that developed, after several years, into a  loose confederation of liberally oriented parties. Our original  idea was to provide a space for an association of parties that  would act as a union externally but internally would keep the  structure of individual parties. We are open to fusion with  other parties.    [Matejovic] To what extent can the post-November syndrome  based on political entities, which were established as various  movements or unions involving a wide spectrum of opinions, pose  a threat to the prospects of Slovak liberalism? Even the name  of your organization indicates that this is an association of  liberal streams and not a party that is a full and clear  crystallization of the intensifying liberal tends in Slovak  policy....    [Moravcik] I believe that the threat you indicated does not  stem from the name of our party but from other facts. We have  to eliminate it by presenting a clear orientation of our program  that will be consistently implemented. The name "union" shows  that all of the streams in the center should unite because they  are scattered. We will try to persuade small parties to join us.    [Matejovic] In the subconsciousness of the people, you are  anti-Meciarites, who lay stress on the education and awareness  of the nation.    [Kovac] We have adopted the idea that educated people make  an educated nation, which is very important, particularly for  young people. Our concern is not to secure a large quantity of  educated and qualified people but, rather, to properly evaluate  their work. We are also embracing the idea that, in the 21st  century, the most important ownership will be intellectual  ownership, knowledge, and skills. If we do not set up this trend  now and if the Slovak nation does not understand it now, we are  bound to cut ourselves off from the European future.    [Matejovic] Hagyari's Democratic Party is exerting efforts  to establish something similar....    [Moravcik] I do not believe we are in a situation where we  need to make it clear, as regards the Democratic Party, what the  domain of our joint actions are. Their program is conservative,  ours is liberal.    [Matejovic] Apart from the Democratic Union of Slovakia, the  Hungarian Civic Party is also supporting liberal ideas. This  party has already become a member of the Liberal International.  What kind of cooperation is there between the Slovak and the  Hungarian liberals?    [Moravcik] So far, we have not established contacts. I  personally believe it is very important for the Hungarian  political parties in Slovakia to integrate or at least cooperate  more closely with the Slovak parties that have a similar  program. It makes little sense to organize parties on the  ethnic principle.    [Kovac] Much will depend on what position the Hungarian  Civic Party takes on the proposed triple coalition of Hungarian  parties. We will certainly cooperate with liberals from the  ranks of ethnic minorities. Among them, the Sub-Carpathian  Germans are the closest to us.</p>

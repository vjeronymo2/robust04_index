			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Strike hits Peruvian copper mine TWENTY MONTHS of labour peace at Southern Peru Copper Corporation, producer of two-thirds of all of Peru's copper, came to an end yesterday when blue-collar workers from all four company unions and white collar workers at the Cuajone mine went on strike. The smelter at Ilo, which produced a record 300,117 short tons (2,000 lb each) of blister last year, was still functioning, according to SPCC. About 40 per cent of operators had turned up for work as normal. A senior company official commented, 'We are maintaining production at near normal levels - we have contingency plans for this sort of situation'. Surprise was expressed in the local mining sector over the SPCC strike, scheduled to last 48 hours. SPCC workers are among the best paid in Peru's mining industry. A 'labour peace' pact for 1992 is still under discussion by the striking unions. The motive for the strike - a technicality for calculating wage rises - 'seems inexplicably trivial,' said one mining industry source in Lima. 'This looks more political than anything else.' SPCC recently announced investment plans totalling Dollars 300m over the next five years. The US-owned company is to build electro-winning plants at both its huge open-cast mines of Cuajone and Toquepala, and a partial capture acid plant for the Ilo smelter. Metal workers blocked traffic and disrupted rail services here to protest at the threatened closure of the 90,000-tonne capacity lead works of Sociedad Minera y Metalurgica de Penarroya Espana, a wholly-owned unit of Franco-German multinational Metaleurop, Reports Reuter from Cartagena.</p>

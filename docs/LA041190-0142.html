			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> CRA policies -- A headline in a Times story March 31 may have created the  erroneous impression that accounting firm owner Deborah Morrisette had  criticized the Community Redevelopment Agency during a workshop for minority-  and women-owned businesses. Additionally, a sentence in the story implied that  Morrisette was critical of practices that permitted Bishop H.H. Brookins and  other influential members of minorities to get city contracts. Morrissette made  no such statement regarding Brookins.  </P></p>

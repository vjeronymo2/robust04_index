			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Oil prices rise sharply - At a Glance Oil prices have risen sharply since the February low of just under Dollars 13 a barrel. The benchmark Brent blend rose above Dollars 17 a barrel at one point this week for the first time since the end of September last year. The most recent rise is caused by a number of factors including concern over tensions with North Korea while Wednesday's decision by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries to cancel its September meeting was taken as confirmation that Opec will stick to its present production ceiling of 24.52m barrels aday until the end of the year. Worries over fighting in Yemen and a raised forecast of world oil demand from the International Energy Agency have also helped the bullish sentiment.</p>

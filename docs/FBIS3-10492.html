			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Maria Helena Tachinardi in La Guaira, Venezuela] </F>   [Text] Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim described as  very positive the visit U.S. Vice President Al Gore will make to  Brazil on 21 March, when he will be received by President Itamar  Franco. On the night of 3 March, Amorim confirmed here to  GAZETA that Gore will meet Franco.    After visiting Argentina, Gore will come immediately to  Brazil, where he will discuss topics such as the environment,  sustainable development, and the U.S.-Latin American summit to  be held in Washington this year.    Amorim said Gore will visit Brazil in an atmosphere of  positive bilateral relations as a result of the U.S. decision to  refrain from imposing trade sanctions on Brazil as part of its  quest for ensuring protection of intellectual property rights.  Commenting on this issue -- which was resolved on 25 February,  Amorim noted that Brazil benefited from the new framework  created on the subject, that is, the wording of "TRIPPS"  (Trade-Related Intellectual Property Protection System)  negotiated under the GATT Uruguay Round.    Amorim also noted that Brazil has made progress in this area  and that his willingness to go to Washington on 16 February just  to discuss the matter with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey  Kantor -- during a 90-minute meeting -- created a good  impression in the United States. Speaking to this newspaper,  Amorim said: "They felt that we have shown interest." Amorim  said a new positive stage has started in our relations that is  "very favorable for cooperation in sustainable development and  investments. Potential issues of conflict have been eliminated."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Eduard Rossel, the ex-governor of Sverdlovsk Oblast,  has been elected chairman of the oblast Duma. Eighteen out of  28 deputies voted for him. Rossel was dismissed from his post  as governor by an edict of the Russian president in November  1993 for overstepping the limits of his powers in connection  with the proclaiming of the Urals Republic. Rossel considers  switching over to a regional policy in the real sense the main  priority of his work as the Duma chairman. This means the  oblast being able to decide independently what to do with its  material and financial resources and being the owner of its  natural resources.</p>

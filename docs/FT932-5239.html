			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / International Company News: Telmex stock falls on warning SHARES in Telefonos de Mexico (Telmex), Mexico's monopoly telephone company, fell sharply in New York and Mexico yesterday as investors reacted to a veiled profits warning from the company's finance director, Mr Adolfo Cerezo. After falling at one point by more than Dollars 2, Telmex's New York-listed American Depositary Receipts closed at Dollars 46 1/4 , down Dollars 1 1/2 . The Mexican stock market was pulled down by Telmex, the exchange's largest stock. Mr Cerezo told investors at a conference organised by the brokerage Smith Barney that 'the second quarter is not going to be easier than the first quarter'. He added that Telmex would not buy back a chunk of its shares as it had previously announced, because it had been unable to obtain a suitable price. First-quarter results were affected by slow growth in the Mexican economy, with revenues and traffic growth lower than analysts had expected. Mr Cerezo said Telmex would continue to suffer from low growth in the second quarter. Trading in Telmex shares is generally higher in New York than in Mexico City. This makes the company particularly vulnerable to the perceptions of US investors, who tend to be more short-term oriented than their Mexican counterparts. Analysts expressed surprise at Thursday's fall in Telmex stock, since Mr Cerezo's comments were made early Wednesday morning. 'The reaction is overdone,' said Mr Jorge Suarez of Nomura Research. 'I'm very surprised that news about the second quarter is having an impact now.' Mr Suarez said he understood that fund managers who were not present at the Smith Barney conference had sold Telmex stock on reports of Mr Cerezo's comments. Another broker described the fall as 'retail-led panic'.</p>

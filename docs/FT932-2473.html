			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / BAe reshapes to protect its dividends BRITISH AEROSPACE is implementing a reorganisation of its businesses that will protect its ability to pay dividends and give greater scope for joint ventures. If the necessary banking approvals are received, BAe's operating businesses will be put into subsidiary companies and BAe plc will become an industrial holding company. The changes are set to take effect from July 1. The move will protect BAe's ability to pay dividends by sheltering the company's reserves from losses in operating subsidiaries. Last September, BAe was forced to apply to the courts for a capital reduction to allow it to continue to pay dividends because losses in its regional jet business left it with insufficient reserves. BAe (Operations) Ltd will be the largest subsidiary and will contain the defence, Airbus and aero-structures manufacturing businesses. The Jetstream aircraft operations and Dynamics missiles division will go into separate subsidiaries, making it easier for joint venture partners to be found for these businesses. BAe intends to merge its Hertfordshire-based missiles operations with the French company Matra. The company is also thought to be talking to several overseas regional airliner manufacturers about possible tie-ups for the Jetstream commuter and regional turboprop business which has been consolidated into one manufacturing site in Prestwick, Scotland. The reorganisation was being done in a tax-efficient way, according to BAe. The company generated significant tax losses when it wrote off Pounds 1bn against its regional jet business last September. Banking approvals may be required for the reorganisation, which BAe says will not affect the security of the banks or of employees. BAe told staff that their terms and conditions will remain unchanged. When BAe was originally vested in 1978 all of its activities were within the parent company, BAe plc. Acquisitions such as Rover, Royal Ordnance and Ballast Nedam under the leadership of Professor Sir Roland Smith created some subsidiaries. 'The hiving down of the remaining businesses will create a more rational modern structure which should not affect banks or employees,' according to Mr Richard Lapthorne, BAe's finance director.

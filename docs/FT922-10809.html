			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Survey of The Isle of Man (4): 'Potential for expansion' - Captive insurance 'The traditional marketplace for insurance is in turmoil. Lloyd's is under severe pressure; some providers are withdrawing from the marketplace; reinsurance capacity is under strain - if not withdrawn - and in some lines of business prices are on an upward spiral. The rapidity of such environmental change verges on the unprecedented, yet in its face the marketplace for the captive, in satisfying a niche insurance need, has been upwardly mobile.' THIS ASSESSMENT comes from Dr Bill Hastings, the Isle of Man's insurance supervisor. Manx-based captive insurance companies continue to increase in numbers, currently 117, and Dr Hastings and the industry feel there is much potential for further expansion. A captive is a wholly-owned subsidiary that ensures some or all of its parent's risks. It may be administered by its own staff or by a captive management company. Captive insurance companies are recognised as being a more economically efficient method of insuring corporate risks, and generally produce better risk management within the parent. By placing them offshore, the company also benefits from a low-tax regime. The parent eliminates brokerage commission and can raise cover on some risks that are difficult to place in the normal market. 'Management is increasingly aware of the economic benefits that such a subsidiary brings to bear upon its organisation,' said Dr Hastings. 'Closer lines of communication and a richer identification by management with what is a rightful management tool can only enhance the control of risk and thereby wealth. 'Beneficial awareness by management, the increasing pervasiveness of risk and the failure of traditional market places to satisfy niche needs mean that the demand by parents to form such insurers from traditional areas such as the UK will continue - and worldwide.' The island was particularly pleased last year to welcome the first captive to come out of the former USSR. This was the Northern Shipping Insurance Company. Its parent is the Northern Shipping Company of Archangel, which has a fleet of about 130 ships. This captive will provide hull and machinery insurance for Northern. Previously, the Soviet mInistry of merchant marine met the cost of damage or loss to the companies' ships. But the changes in that part of the world meant that shipping companies had to look elsewhere for cover. The captive is managed by Isle of Man Insurance Management; and Mr Peter Vick, a director, regarded it as an exciting development which opened up possibilities for further business from that part of the world. Within a few months, a second captive from the former USSR, Baltic Shipping, was formed under management by Isle of Man Insurance. A third, Azov, is expected shortly. There are 27 managers in the Isle of Man, including major companies, such as Sedgwick, Willis Coroon, Alexander and Bowring. Managers feel there are still many UK companies that could form captives, but also expect the continental Europeans to begin to recognise the advantage of having their own insurance company. The experience and expertise exists within the island's financial services community to handle more captives than are currently registered there. The diversity of financial services available in the island add to its attraction as a location for captives. All the ancillary needs of a company can be met there. 'There can be no doubt, worldwide awareness is on an upward surge,' said Dr Hastings. 'Significant maturing of attitude is to be found in many foreign jurisdictions; demand is on the increase, and in response we find many more potential offshore jurisdictions entering the arena. 'The danger in such growth, of course, is one of dilution, and it is for this very reason that the Isle of Man will seek not only to retain its forward position but also to set the trend.'</p>

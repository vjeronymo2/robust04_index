			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by V. Ruiz de Azua and L.R. Aizpeolea: "Aznar and </F> Arzalluz Normalize Relations With Their Second Meeting in Two  Months"]    [Text] The People's Party [PP] and the PNV [Basque  Nationalist Party] are continuing with the normalization of  their relations. Their two chairmen -- Jose Maria Aznar and  Xabier Arzalluz -- held a meeting lasting almost two hours in  Madrid yesterday, on the former's initiative. Aznar invited  Arzalluz to his home and then accompanied him to a shopping mall  so that his companion, nationalist leader Juan Maria Ollora,  could buy a book on the fall of Mario Conde. According to  sources in the two parties, the conversation was cordial, and  occurred "irrespective" of the political differences.    The PNV does not share the PP's stance of censuring the  government, while Aznar holds the PNV and its chairman jointly  responsible for the impossibility of submitting a censure  motion. However, the two leaders have held a meeting for the  second time in two months, and, also for the second time,  Arzalluz has stated that Aznar seems to him "a good person," and  that he would trust him to conclude an agreement. The previous  meeting took place secretly around Easter Week in Burgos, midway  between Madrid and Bilbao.    On this occasion, however, Arzalluz agreed to visit Aznar in  the morning in his office at PP headquarters, at 13 Genova  Street in Madrid. When the date of the meeting became known the  day before yesterday, the PP chairman offered him the  possibility of going to his home to avoid being hounded by  cameras.    The normalization of relations with the PP enables the PNV  chairman to reaffirm his independence from the Socialists, with  whom he is governing in a coalition in the Basque Country. It  enables Aznar to show that, despite the disagreements, he is  keeping channels of communication with other parliamentary  parties open, and that the current disagreement does not mean  isolation.    The conversation was attended by Basque PP Chairman Jaime  Mayor Oreja and PNV leader Juan Maria Ollora. The two men, with  other leaders of each party, will undertake to study over the  next few weeks the PNV's autonomy proposals, which Arzalluz had  already handed to his interlocutor in Burgos, contained in  several documents.    Mayor Oreja stated in the afternoon that everything was  discussed a little without prior order, without trying to seek  any commitment or change of stance by either side. The PNV  emphasized to the PP its intention to shun extremist stances  with respect to the Socialist government, intimating that it  will not take part in a destructive strategy or one of all-out  resistance.    In this connection, Arzalluz asked Aznar to tone down the  political strategy of tension maintained by the PP, using the  corruption scandals. The PNV chairman told his host that the  strategy that "seeks to erode leads to nothing good," according  to nationalist sources.  <H5>  Joint Study </H5>   The PP and nationalist leaders took up again some of the  matters that were discussed in the conversation held 29 March in  Burgos. On that occasion, the possibility of setting up a kind  of committee to study together the implementation of the Gernika  Statute was raised. This idea of PP Deputy Secretary General  Mariano Rajoy caught on at yesterday's meeting in producing a  response from another of those attending the meeting -- Juan  Maria Ollora. Both Mayor Oreja and Ollora will hold contacts  and extend them successively with contributions from [Basque  autonomous government] Councilor of the President's Office  Joseba Zubia and Councilor of Finance Juan Luis Larrea -- both  belonging to the PNV -- who are the negotiators on autonomy with  the central administration.    The nationalists believe that this interchange is necessary  in view of the uncertainty of the political scene that is  developing not only in Spain but also in the Basque Country  itself. Next fall's autonomous community elections leave the  scene open, in the nationalists' opinion, and although the most  likely outcome is that the current government coalition of  Socialists and nationalists will continue, a result leading to a  new government combination in which the PNV's new partner would  be the PP is not ruled out.    But the central aim of the meeting -- arranged last week  before Deputy Prime Minister Narcis Serra's appearance in the  Congress [of Deputies] to answer questions on the Roldan affair  -- was to relax relations between the two parties. "We are  experiencing a time when we should all discuss everything, and  not just in parliament," Arzalluz said yesterday, shortly before  his meeting with Aznar. Later, nationalist sources close to the  participants stated that the meeting was "cordial and relaxed."  "Discussion between the leaders moderates language. The PNV is  not at the eye of the PP's storm, nor is the PP at the eye of  the PNV's storm. This meeting will help to calm the general  political scene," the same sources said.</p>

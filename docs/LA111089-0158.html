			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> MORMONS TO BUILD NEW CHURCH CENTER  </P> <P> The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints will hold a ground-breaking  ceremony at 10 a.m. Saturday for a 45,074-square-foot center on Greenville  Street, north of MacArthur Boulevard, in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> The $8-million, two-story brick building will include two chapels, several  classrooms, administrative offices, a stage and a full basketball court. Called  the Santa Ana Stake Center, the structure will serve 4,000 Mormons from five  wards in the Santa Ana area. There are three Spanish-language wards, Tongan and  Samoan wards, and Cambodian, Korean and Vietnamese branches of the church in  the area.  </P> <P> Construction, scheduled to begin Dec. 15, is expected to take one year.  </P> <P> Unlike many other Orange County congregations, whose building projects have  been stymied by skyrocketing land costs, the Mormons were able to draw on  resources from members worldwide, who are required to tithe 10% of their gross  income.  </P></p>

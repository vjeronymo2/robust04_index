			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vladislav Borodulin in the "Russian Government </F> Session" column incorporating commentary by the economic policy  department: "The Premier Has Called on the Government to Work  with Its Head, Not Its Feet"]    [Text] A feature of yesterday's session of the Russian  Government was its extremely jittery atmosphere. Calls from  some ministers to keep calm gave way to apocalyptic predictions  by others. At times presentations turned into a bitter  squabble. Meanwhile the premier, who had just returned from  leave, appealed to his subordinates to put first the interests  of Russia, not their departments. Government "back-benchers" --  apparatus officers -- tired by the stuffiness of an overcrowded  room, did not particularly try to fight off an overpowering  drowsiness.    The reason for this situation, generally uncharacteristic of  the Viktor Chernomyrdin cabinet, was the issue discussed at the  session. Putting aside all other items on the agenda, the  participants concentrated on summing up the results of the first  half-year. Strictly speaking, there was no particular need for a  report by First Deputy Economics Minister Yakov Urinson:  Exactly a week ago the government examined the economic  situation. However, having returned from his leave, the premier  decided to familiarize himself with the situation.    According to Urinson, the industrial recession has reached  26  percent in the first six months of this year, nearly halving  compared to 1991. An analysis of the decline pattern done by  the Economics Ministry for the first time is noteworthy.  Ministry experts attributed 35 percent of this slump to cuts in  military spending; another 15 percent, to cuts in budget  investments; 10 percent is linked to falling demand for oil in  the CIS countries (caused by high prices), and 10 percent is due  to declining effective demand among the Russian population. The  remaining 30 percent has been caused "by the effects of market  mechanisms, poor adaptability among enterprise managers, and the  breakdown of economic links."    The gist of the conclusions made by ministry experts is  this:  A basically new economic situation has emerged in Russia. Its  signs include the weakening of nonmarket factors and the effects  of demand constraints, which has brought about a sales crisis.  Urinson stopped short of calling this state depression.    There is no particular point in recounting the content of  subsequent reports by sector ministers: a standard (with rare  exceptions) set of excuses and a minimum of sensible  propositions. Viktor Chernomyrdin's reaction to these  presentations surprised even the veterans of the government  apparatus. One of them recalled Aleksey Kosygin, usually a very  discreet premier in the USSR Government, who yelled at his  subordinates only once: When he lost patience with immoderate  sectoral claims by then ministers and their total disregard for  state interests.    Viktor Chernomyrdin yesterday chose a similar vocabulary and  tonality. "We shall not give anything to anyone for free";  "ministries must reflect the interests of the entire state, not  just of their own enterprises"; and "we will not be bossed  around by anybody" are quite happy expressions of gratitude to  the president for his determination "not to ditch Chernomyrdin."    The premier also reacted to the president's criticism of the  government's performance. "Well, enough is enough; we shall not  put up with this any more" and "I shall have enough political  will for everything" -- these words are apparently to be one of  the last warnings to the sluggish intermediary government level.  True, weekly public sermons to subordinates have now been  practiced for more than a month.  <H5>  Commentary </H5>   The draft presidential edict "On Amendments to the Russian  Federation President's 23 May 1994 Edict No. 1004 On Certain  Questions of Tax Policy", moved by the Russian Social Insurance  Fund for government consideration, was taken off the agenda at  the very beginning of the session. The draft envisioned  revoking instructions to the government to submit to the State  Duma a draft law on reducing the rate of payments to the social  insurance fund to 3.6 percent from 5.4 percent. Apparently,  serious substantiation will be needed to encourage the president  to cancel one of his proposals to alleviate the tax burden. So  far the fund's case boils down to a shortage of funds: Revenues  in the second half will fall by 2 trillion rubles, as a result  of which the fund will not have enough money to pay even the  benefits stipulated by the law. True, temporary disability  allowances, for example, are paid out of the fund's money held  in enterprise accounts. If the fund's figures are correct, this  will primarily affect the poor, who get their benefits through  social security bodies, which is promises an aggravation of  social tension.    The fact that the draft edict was taken off the agenda does  not mean anything: Even if the government insists on reducing  the rate, the same can hardly be expected from the State Duma.    Meanwhile, unless the Duma remembers, in the very near  future, about the need to establish a new rate for contributions  to nonbudget funds (or extend the old one), beginning with 1  July they may not be paid at all.  <H5>  Main macroeconomic indicators in the first half of 1994 </H5>   Gross domestic product in current prices will total 248  trillion rubles. At constant prices GDP will fall by 18 percent  compared to the same period last year.    The volume of industrial output will decline by 26 percent  compared to the first half of 1993.    Exports will grow by 3.6 percent, reaching $20 billion.  Imports will grow by 18 percent to approximately $15 billion.  The balance of trade will be $5 billion (a fall of 24 percent).    The exhange rate of the national currency will fall by 60  percent compared to December 1993, exceeding 2,000 rubles per  $1. The purchasing power of the ruble, compared to the dollar,  will increase by 18 percent.    Real estimated monetary incomes will grow by 14 percent.    The number of officially registered unemployed is estimated  at 1.4 million, which is 0.6 million people more than at the  beginning of the year.</p>

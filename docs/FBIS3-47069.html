			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Zagreb, Yugoslavia, Jan. 9 KYODO -- Yasushi Akashi,  the Japanese national who heads peacekeeping operations in  former Yugoslavia, asked Saturday [8 January] if Japan could  send personnel to the United Nations mission in the region, a  Japanese delegation said.    The head of the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in former  Yugoslavia suggested parts of Macedonia and Croatia as sites for  Japan's possible participation.    Akashi made the request during a meeting with an 11-member  fact-finding mission which arrived in the Croatian capital of  Zagreb from Japan earlier in the day, officials said.    He did not specify if he sought military or civilian  peacekeepers. The Japanese team did not give an immediate  response, the officials said.    Akashi told the delegation that the situation is relatively  stable in parts of Macedonia and Croatia.    He noted that some Asian states like Nepal and Malaysia are  joining the U.N. Protection Force in former Yugoslavia.    In an interview with Fuji TV of Tokyo, delegation head  Shunji  Yanai said Akashi did not ask Japan to send peacekeepers to the  Balkan region.    Yanai, speaking by telephone from Zagreb, said Akashi merely  told the team that he hopes Japan will positively engage in a  personnel contribution.    Yanai told Fuji's news report 2001 program that Akashi did  not specify if the contribution meant dispatch of peacekeepers  or sending medical or communication teams.    The Japanese delegation left Tokyo on Friday and arrived in  Zagreb on Saturday via Amsterdam and Vienna. Members are there  to study possible roles for Japan in the U.N. operation. They  will stay in former Yugoslavia through January 16, visiting  Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia and the new Yugoslavia.  The mission returns home January 16.    Yanai, head of the Foreign Ministry's Foreign Policy Bureau,  played a key role in realizing Japan's legislation in June 1992  on cooperation in U.N. peacekeeping missions. He was then  director general of the ministry's Treaties Bureau which  supervises treaties and laws under its jurisdiction.    Under the U.N. Peace Cooperation Law, Japan sent two  600-member engineering teams in rotation from the Self-Defense  Forces (SDF) to join U.N. operations in Cambodia between the  fall of 1992 and the fall of 1993.    A smaller SDF transportation support team is helping a U.S.  peacekeeping mission in Mozambique.</p>

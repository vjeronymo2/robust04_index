			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Property: Good faith can sometimes wobble - How estate agents may run into trouble over payment of agency fees OWNERS of less-expensive houses pay up and owners in the north of England tend not to quibble about the costs of a sale. But in the rarified world of million-pound houses, flats and even country homes in the south-east, the practice of 'skipping' fees is becoming a potentially-crippling feature of the market for estate agents. A random sample of sales agencies, from Carlisle to Nottingham, suggests that fee loss is not a significant problem outside the south-east. Sale values tend to be lower and agency clients hold by their deals. But the picture is different in London. In the late summer and autumn last year, Antoine Lurot, of mews property specialist Lurot Brand, highlighted an evident change of attitude by vendors to agency fees. He revealed that he had been forced to seek asset-freezing injunctions to stop former clients leaving the country without paying their bills. At the time, his public comment inspired only a limited response from other agents. But the sales market was so quiet at the time that examples of non-payment were few and far between. Since the New Year, as asking prices subside steadily to reflect real recessional values, sales volume has started to pick up. And with more completions being achieved, the 'sell for free' problems are growing. Take Winkworth's franchised offices around London. Spokeswoman Hilary Wade says there now are 'lots of problems collecting fees. You get people who are refusing to pay and others who just cannot pay.' She adds: 'If they genuinely cannot pay, the office may try to come to an arrangement.' But she notes: 'It is the more expensive homes - the top end, not the bottom - that try to get away with it.' Among high-value properties in central London, for example, the amounts some vendors try to avoid paying are substantial. When you take into account a 2-2 1/2 per cent sale fee for a Pounds 1m property, plus perhaps a further 1 per cent of the value for advertising costs, you are looking at a respectable-sized cheque, even for a wealthy owner. A classic example of the problem comes from agent John D. Wood and Aylesford, which had reason to break out the champagne after the successful sale of a London town house a few weeks ago. At Pounds 2.2m, the agency had achieved full value for the property after months of trying. The vendor should be delighted. Within 24 hours of completion, however, the agent was told there was no money for its fees. The bank mortgage on the property, plus legal costs, had absorbed all the sale proceeds. George Pope, of John D. Wood, says that incorporating a clear contract for eventual payment of fees, at the time an agent is instructed on a property, is not worth the paper on which it is written if the vendor does not have any cash left over after the sale. Calling on the client's solicitor to ensure that agreed sale fees are held out of the completion money tends to be an equally futile exercise. In provincial towns and cities, the local sales agents and solicitors have to get along together and tend to co-operate. In London, though, agents find solicitors deeply reluctant to respond to requests to put aside some part of their client's funds for someone else's fees. In the heavily-international central London residential market, client identity can be a problem in itself. Savills' Noel De Keyzer says: 'You do have to be incredibly careful these days to make sure you know who your client really is. Is it the person you see the house with and arrange the instructions? Is it the wife? Is it a company?' Having identified the client, Andrew Langton of Aylesford makes the point that 'there is a certain element of good faith' in the relationship between agent and client which does assume that fees will be paid. Recently, however: 'We have had to start looking out for people who are hiding behind companies and individuals who might be even mildly 'wobbly'.' Langton recalls when it was normal for estate agents, rather than solicitors, to hold the deposits on property sales, and when fees could be deducted from that cash. Now, he accepts that any attempt to wrest back that deposit-holding role from the lawyers looks like a lost cause. A more worrying development for agents is the rise of the would-be discretionary fee-payer. Simon de Boinville deals with country-house sales for John D. Wood from its Winchester office. He tells of clients sending in cheques for a proportion of the agreed sale fees which are marked as if 'in full settlement' of costs. De Boinville, and a number of his counterparts in other agencies dealing with town sales, also report the arrival of a breed of client who expects to be able to re-negotiate fees downwards after the completion of a sale. The partial payers, the re-negotiators, and those who simply refuse to pay and tell their agent: 'Sue me,' know full well that estate agents' rely more than most service businesses on the good faith of their clients. Up among high value properties it is evident that this good faith is in increasingly short supply.</p>

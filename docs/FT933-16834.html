			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Weather havoc sends US soya futures higher still RELENTLESS RAINS in the maize and soyabean-growing regions of the US are wreaking havoc on many grain farms and trimming US harvest prospects by the day. Some desperate farmers are attempting to seed soggy fields by air, but others have abandoned the effort. Crops planted after the beginning of July, they said, would shrivel in the late summer heat. The heaviest rainfall in 18 years has also stalled barge traffic on 500 miles of the upper Mississippi river, the primary transport corridor for grains export from the Texas and Lousiana coasts. Rising water has impeded navigation and lock operation. Planting delays have sparked the biggest soyabean rally in four years at the Chicago Board of Trade. Soyabeans for harvest-time delivery rallied by 14 per cent from June 15 to a high of Dollars 6.60 1/2 a bushel yesterday. Mr William Biedermann, vice president of Allendale, an agricultural research company, expects soyabean prices to reach Dollars 7 before the rally ebbs. 'We're forecasting fewer planted acres and lower yields,' he said yesterday. 'There is no doubt the crop is in trouble.' The US Department of Agriculture planned to release its latest survey of farmer's planting intentions yesterday afternoon. But the survey, which was conducted early in June, will not reflect subsequent planting delays and private crop forecasters will trim 2m to 3m acres off the government's estimate to take account of these. Last year the US harvested 55 million tonnes of soyabeans, nearly three times the amount of the next biggest producer, Brazil. This year the US soya crop could be as small as 50m tonnes, Mr Biedermann said. With rising exports and a smaller crop, the margin between supply and demand could narrow to a dangerously thin 65m bushels (60 lb each), or less than two week's supply, he added. Ending stocks in the US have averaged 324m bushels over the last five years. While maize planting is also lagging, maize prices have not exploded like those for soyabeans. Healthy carryover stocks from last year's record crop will cushion domestic and export buyers from a smaller crop, grain dealers say. Mr Mike Espy, the US agriculture secretary, who yesterday surveyed the four states most affected by the rains, may release federal disaster payments to the hardest-hit farmers. Fifteen Iowa counties have already been declared state disaster areas.</p>

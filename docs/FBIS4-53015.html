			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 16 (KCNA) -- The Political Bureau of  the Congolese Socialist Party on May 5 published an appeal on  the grave situation created in the Korean peninsula.    Recalling that the United States has turned South Korea into  a nuclear depot filled with mass destruction weapons including  more than 1,000 nuclear weapons, grossly violating the Korean  Armistice Agreement, the appeal said:    "The DPRK's proposal for negotiation to replace the nominal  Armistice Agreement by a peace agreement and establish a new  peace- keeping arrangement is a most fair measure for removing  the hostile relations between the DPRK and the United States and  realising negotiation."    Expressing the hope that DPRK-USA negotiation would be  realized in a short time and measures be taken for bringing a  lasting peace on the Korean peninsula where the situation has  reached the brink of war, the appeal urged the U.S. Government  to substantially contribute to world peace.</p>

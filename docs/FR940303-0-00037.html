			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Manner of verification <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . An Agency may verify that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taxpayer has incurred more than 10 percent of its reasonably  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expected basis in a project by obtaining a certification from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the taxpayer, in writing and under penalty of perjury, that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the taxpayer has incurred by the close of the calendar year of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the allocation more than 10 percent of the reasonably expected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis in the project. The certification must be accompanied  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by supporting documentation that the Agency must review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Supporting documentation may include, for example, copies of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> checks or other records of payments. Alternatively, an Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may verify that the taxpayer has incurred adequate basis by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requiring that the taxpayer obtain from an attorney or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certified public accountant a written certification to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency, that the attorney or accountant has examined all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligible costs incurred with respect to the project and that,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based upon this examination, it is the attorney's or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accountant's belief that the taxpayer has incurred more than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10 percent of its reasonably expected basis in the project by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the close of the calendar year of the allocation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Time of verification <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . An Agency may require that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis certification be submitted to or received by the Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prior to the close of the calendar year of allocation or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within a reasonable time after the close of the calendar year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of allocation. The Agency will need to verify basis in order  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to accurately complete the Form 8610, Annual Low-Income  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Housing Credit Agencies Report, for the calendar year. If  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification is not timely made, or supporting documentation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is lacking, inadequate, or does not actually support the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification, the Agency should notify the taxpayer and try  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to get adequate documentation. If the Agency cannot verify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before the Form 8610 is filed that the taxpayer has satisfied  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the basis requirement for a carryover allocation, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allocation is treated as if it had not been made and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carryover allocation document should not be filed with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Form 8610.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Requirements for making carryover allocations <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In general <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Generally, an allocation is made when an Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issues the Form 8609, Low-Income Housing Credit Allocation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Certification, for a building. See &sect;1.42&hyph;1T(d)(8)(ii). An  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency does not issue the Form 8609 for a building until the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> building is placed in service. However, in cases where  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allocations of credit are made pursuant to section 42(h)(1)(E)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (relating to carryover allocations for buildings) or section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 42(h)(1)(F) (relating to carryover allocations for multiple-building projects), Form 8609 is not used as the allocating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> document because the buildings are not yet in service. When  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an allocation is made pursuant to section 42(h)(1) (E) or (F), the allocating document is the document meeting the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of paragraph (d)(2) of this section. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, when an allocation is made pursuant to section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 42(h)(1)(F), the requirements of paragraph (d)(3) of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section must be met for the allocation to be valid. An  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allocation pursuant to section 42(h)(1) (E) or (F) reduces the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> state housing credit ceiling for the year in which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allocation is made, whether or not the Form 8609 is also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issued in that year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Requirements for allocation <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . An allocation pursuant to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 42(h)(1) (E) or (F) is made when an allocation document  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containing the following information is completed, signed, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dated by an authorized official of the Agency_  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

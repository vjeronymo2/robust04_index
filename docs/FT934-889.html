			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Wessex Water It was hard luck that Wessex chose to release its interim figures on the day the latest bull run in water shares came to an end. A 20 per cent increase in pre-tax profits and a 10 per cent dividend increase were hardly excuses for yesterday's sell-off in the sector. Holding operating costs steady in the regulated water business for the third year running, due to the introduction of flexible working practices and performance related pay, is especially impressive. Yet it is the success of Wessex's joint venture in waste management that underpins the dividend. A doubling of half-year profits in waste is a welcome contrast to the red ink being spilt elsewhere in the sector. That said, the heady pace of acquisitions - another five were completed in the last six months - makes the underlying progress difficult to judge. Without an improvement in landfill prices, any margin gains will be hard won. With cash still in hand from January's rights issue, Wessex could easily finance its portion of another large acquisition in waste. If the prospects are as good as it says, it would do well to move sooner rather than later. Keeping rights money in the bank at current rates of interest will do nothing to improve earnings per share.</p>

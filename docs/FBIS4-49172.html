			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 4 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-President  Rong Yiren expressed the hope here today that Sino-U.S. ties  would be further improved and developed.    He told Frank Zarb, vice-chairman and executive officer of  the Travelers Company of the United States, during their meeting  that since the two countries play important roles in the world,  the improvement and development of their bilateral ties would  not only serve the interests of the two peoples, but also  benefit peace and development in the world.    He hoped that the existing differences should not damage  normal political and economic exchanges between the two  countries, and that the differences could be solved through  discussions and exchanges.    He said that the meeting between Chinese President Jiang  Zemin and U.S. President Clinton in Seattle last year was  beneficial to the improvement of bilateral relations, and he  hoped that the favorable tendency of development could be  maintained.    Zarb agreed with Rong's views and said that in the United  States many people now enthusiastically hope that U.S.-China  relations will improve.    Zarb and his party are here as guests of the China  International Trust and Investment Company.    The Travelers Company is one of the largest insurance  companies in the United States, with total assets valued at over  101.3 billion U.S. dollars, and the turnover in 1993 stood at  6.8 billion U.S. dollars.</p>

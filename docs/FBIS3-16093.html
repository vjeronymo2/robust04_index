He  made the statement in Tunis on the results of the meeting with  the chairman of the PLO Executive Committee. During the meeting  Yasir 'Arafat was handed a personal message from Russian  Federation [RF] President Boris Yeltsin. Kozyrev pointed out  that the decision of the Palestinian side demanded great  political courage on the part of the PLO and of Y. 'Arafat  personally.    The Palestinian leadership is counting on the swift and  complete carrying out of the resolution, the draft of which was  drawn up at the UN Security Council in connection with the  massacre at El-Khalil, the head of the RF foreign political  department noted. The PLO is hoping that Russia and the United  States as co-founders of the Arab-Israeli peace talks will  guarantee the implementation of this document.    In the opinion of the Russian minister, the priority task at  the present time is the fastest possible implementation of the  Palestinian-Israeli agreement on the Gaza sector and Jericho,  which was signed in Washington in September last year. Russia,  stressed A. Kozyrev, will promote the implementation of the  provisions of this agreement and the UN Security Council  resolution as far as possible, "which everyone is expecting".    The Russian side is also in favor of the resumption of the  talks between all the Arab states and Israel for the purpose of  acceleratingn progress towards an agreement in all the  directions of the dialogue, Kozyrev stated. He said that he  intended to discuss the question of the role of the co-founders  of the Near East peace process at the forthcoming stage during  the meeting which is soon to take place with U.S. Secretary of  State Warren Christopher in Vladivostok.</p>

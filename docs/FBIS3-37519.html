			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow--In an exclusive interview with a UNIAN  correspondent on 16 February, Yevgeniy Saburov, director of the  Center for Informational and Social Technologies under the  Russian Federation's Government--who intends to take up the  performance of his duties as the Republic of the Crimea deputy  prime minister [as received] in the very near future--said the  principal aim of his activity at the new post, in his view, was  to set up an effective economic mechanism that would make the  life of the peninsula's population considerably easier.    "I will also seek to make the Crimea an open republic that  will not secede from anyone. I am a man of well-considered  views, and I think that politics must serve the people rather  than making things difficult for them," Saburov said.    Under Ukrainian legislation, Saburov cannot be appointed to  a  state post because he is a Russian citizen. Answering a  question from the UNIAN correspondent about his possibly  obtaining Ukrainian citizenship, the Crimea's future deputy  prime minister said he had not seen any relevant documents that  would make it enforceable. This, in his words, is up to Crimean  President Yuriy Meshkov, who proposed that he should form and  lead the republican government. "I accepted his proposal, so the  Crimean president--as a lawyer--must put it into practice. Of  course, one can recall similar precedents in Estonia and Armenia  where other states' citizens head government structures,"  Saburov noted. The wish of those concerned with their country,  in his view, is to attract professionals to manage the economy.    On the subject of the Crimea's purely economic problems--in  particular, introducing the parallel use of the Russian ruble  and the Ukrainian karbovanets on the Crimean peninsula and the  possible self-financing of this autonomous republic--Saburov  added: "Telling representatives of the Russian mass media about  agreeing with Kiev on the issue of the Crimea's `rublization', I  quoted Yuriy Meshkov as saying this on his visit to Moscow.  This step would be beneficial both to the Crimea and Ukraine.  As for self-financing of the autonomy, this question is still  to be studied. Everything depends on the taxation basis and  budgetary regulation."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Today's appearance by Aleksandr Rutskoy at the  All-Russian Exhibition Center partly satisfied the old interest  of journalists in the person of the ex-vice president. He  commented on the rumors of a coup in preparation in his own way:    [Begin recording] [Rutskoy] The Supreme Soviet got in the  way  so they destroyed it, they shot up the parliament. Now  something else has to get in the way. But who? What? You have  to distract people's attention. Nobody was ever even dreaming  of any coups. The coup has already happened, the coup d'etat has  already happened in this state. So what coups are there to talk  about?    [Unidentified correspondent] The idea of civic accord is not  an undisputed one for Aleksandr Vladimirovich.    [Rutskoy] Agree with who? With those who plundered the state  and destroyed it? With those who shot up the parliament? You  want me to agree with them? [end recording] [passage omitted]    [Moscow Radio Rossii Network in Russian at 1900 GMT on 22  March carries the following voice recording of Rutskoy at the  Russian Exhibition, answering reporters' questions: "Industrial  instability, rocking the boat, playing games, agreements,  money-centrism -- all of this will end badly. One cannot play  games with laws. Laws exist to be fulfilled. When we learn to  obey the laws we shall live well. Otherwise there is no  democracy, there is anarchy."]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["News Analysis" by Teng Wenqi: "Crucial Week for S. </F> African April Elections"]    [Text] Johannesburg, April 11 (XINHUA) -- A showdown might  come out this week among South Africa's chief political players  over the situation in the eastern South African province of  Natal, the kwaZulu homeland in particular.    President F. W. de Klerk, African National Congress (ANC)  President Nelson Mandela, Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini and  Inkatha Freedom Party President Mangosuthu Buthelezi held a  crisis summit on April 8 on the situation in Natal and the  adjoining kwaZulu homeland.    The Zulu king declared independence of the `Zulu Kingdom' on  March 18 and called on the Zulu people to boycott South Africa's  first non-racial elections scheduled on April 26-28.    The government and the ANC tried to persuade the king to  drop  his claim in exchange for a guarantee for the accommodation of  the Zulu king position in the new constitution.    However, they did not reach any agreement at the summit  except establishing a working group to deliberate on various  proposals and report back to the respective leaders on April 14.    This week is considered crucial for the April 26-28  elections  as the time is short for more talks and various preparations.    Observers here are suspicious very much on the results of  the  second meeting of the four leaders due this week.    They do not believe the Zulu king, with the support of  Buthelezi, who is also chief minister of the kwaZulu homeland  government, will change his position in such a short period.  And, his demands are far beyond the government or the ANC to be  able to meet.    On the contrary, the observers believe the kwaZulu homeland  might face an intensified security crackdown if the last gasp  talks this week fail to produce a breakthrough in the electoral  impasse.    There are widespread fears that violence in Natal Province  might soar if the working group fails to produce any concrete  result.    There is deep pessimism in both the government and the ANC  circles over the prospects of this week's talks between the four  leaders.    `Even if we manage to reach agreement in the working group  --  which is possible -- it appears that it will be blocked by the  Inkatha Freedom Party leadership,' said a senior government  official.    Mandela expressed his intention to meet with the Zulu king  again after their talks on April 8. But the king has not  responded by now.    With the failure of the four-way crisis summit on April 8,  it  is understood that security measures will be considerably  intensified in Natal Province if tension there continues to lead  to bloodshed.    This week is also crucial to the kwaZulu homeland and the  Zulu monarchy. The low-key civil war raging in the region could  escalate and become out of control.    Constitutional Development Minister Roelf Meyer said  yesterday about 60 percent of Natal's inhabitants would be able  to participate freely in the elections, but the Inkatha Freedom  Party supporters are scaring people away from the elections.    Meyer warned that if the elections were postponed, the  future  of the country would be determined by radical elements of the  left and the right, and that a Bosnian-style situation would  appear in South Africa.    People in South Africa are watching the development of the  situation in the country with great concern and care.</p>

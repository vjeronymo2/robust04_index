			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (32): PostScript Fading short-term fortunes are visible pretty well across the whole range of unit trusts and investment trusts. With markets around the globe turning dreary to poor in the second quarter of the year, it is very hard to find unit trusts that have achieved a return of 30 per cent over a year. Our list three months ago contained dozens of such funds, especially in the Far East and continental Europe. This time there are only six or seven, led by Providence Capitol European with an impressive 48.5 per cent. The much more typical picture is that of a fund which has shown a slightly negative return over 12 months. All the sector averages for the UK and North America are in this position - although this is a harsh test, because the one-year figures bear the full burden of the gap between bid and offer prices (usually about 6 per cent). The outlook for the short-term performance numbers during the remainder of 1994 remains poor, because most stock markets around the world were rising strongly during the third and fourth quarters of 1993. Unless unit prices make very good progress from here, they will be slipping further and further behind their year-earlier values. Does it matter? Not in the sense that unit trusts (and investment trusts, too) should normally be regarded as long-term investments. Over periods like five years (and certainly over 10 years) nearly all funds are showing decent profits. But short-term timing can still be important. Last year was the biggest year ever for net sales of unit trusts to investors, at Pounds 9.1bn, and there was a surge of new investment trust issues, too, amounting to Pounds 3bn. Most of the money that went in during 1993, certainly in the later months, is likely to show a loss over one year. Investors who subscribed back in 1992 did a great deal better. The average unit trust returned about 27 per cent during 1993. The trouble is, only Pounds 0.7bn was invested in unit trusts in 1992, a particularly poor year for sales. The old problem of feast and famine is being seen again. Investors dither when the stock market is cheap, and are then lured in near the top. Another generation of investors becomes disappointed. The one-year investment trust figures are looking healthier than the unit trust equivalents, with most sectors showing a positive return of 10 per cent or so. However, the figures strictly speaking ought to be reduced by 3 or 4 per cent, reflecting initial dealing costs and spreads, to make them comparable with the unit trust performance. Meanwhile pressure from the continuing wave of new investment trust issues, which has pulled in another Pounds 3bn in just the past six months, is beginning to weaken the average discount to asset value for the sector, though the damage has been modest so far. Private investors, in fact, have still been buying collective funds on quite a heavy scale in recent months, and the causes of the weakness in stock markets have originated elsewhere, in the gyrations of international bond markets. If savers are learning the lesson that it is better to buy into weakness rather than into a heady bull market, then they may improve their long-term results.</p>

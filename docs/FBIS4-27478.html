			<p>BFN     [Text] Fiji's prime minister, Sitiveni Rabuka, says he is  grateful the Australian Government has joined Fiji in bilateral  cooperation in the Southwest Pacific. He was speaking during a  visit to Western Australia where he was attending a handing over  ceremony near Fremantle of the newest Pacific patrol boat to the  Fijian Defense Forces. The boat is the 17th built in Australia  under a project involving 11 Pacific island nations.    Mr. Rabuka says the patrol boat program has a direct bearing  on endeavors to strengthen Fiji's economic security, its fight  against illicit drugs and contraband, and protection of its  marine resources. The Fiji prime minister says the handing over  of the boat is a significant event in the bilateral and  cooperative approach that Australia and Fiji are adopting in  developing their region. Mr. Rabuka says it also symbolizes a  firm and abiding commitment by Canberra and Suva to continue to  build on a strong friendship based on common and mutual  interests in the South Pacific.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Major General Herzl Budinger, the Air Force  commander, disclosed that in the wake of the F-15I deal, the IDF  [Israel Defense Forces] and the Air Force in particular are  postponing the implementation of several plans. For instance,  the procurement of Black Hawk helicopters is being put off until  1998.    Gen. Budinger told a news conference called to mark the deal  with McDonnell Douglas Corporation that it would be  inconceivable for rival Lockheed to cease all purchases in  Israel immediately. He believes such threats were not made by  the company's management in the United States but by Elul, which  represents McDonnell Douglas in Israel. He sharply attacked the  company representatives, saying that they had conducted a  personal campaign against him.</p>

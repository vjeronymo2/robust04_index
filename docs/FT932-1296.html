			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Arts: Glyndebourne on the South Bank - Summer opera Something rather odd is going on at the Royal Festival Hall. Glyndebourne, heavily occupied with the building of its new theatre down in Sussex, is this summer attempting to console patrons with three concert performances each of three operas - Berlioz's Beatrice et Benedict and Fidelio this week, The Merry Widow a month hence, all with (as usual) the London Philharmonic Orchestra in attendance. The advertising and programme book have traded liberally on the name of the festival. But what unfolded in the hall on Monday and Tuesday evenings did so little credit thereto that I was tempted to think I imagined the whole Glyndebourne connection myself. Nothing wrong with the original idea. In the past, indeed, some of the most rewarding examples of London operas-in-concert have derived from this source. Glyndebourne visits to the Albert Hall Proms, with intelligently potted versions of one of the season's productions, are justly prized. Even in the less convivial surroundings of the Festival Hall I recall similar triumphs: a few years ago Haitink's Nozze di Figaro company, having just completed an EMI recording, gave so mercurial an account of the piece that one was briefly moved to wonder why Mozart comic opera ever needed theatrical rendition at all; and the 1991 Jenufa which brought together Andrew Davis and three of his 1989 cast achieved a gut-wrenching summary of what made that Janacek production great in the first place. But all of those events sprang out of 'real' performances, reviving live-wire ensembles already formed. The current choice of repertory - the Berlioz opera has never been performed at the festival, the Beethoven not for a decade - was not geared to striking such a re-creative spark. Nevertheless, accurate casting and fine preparation might still have achieved it. These are, after all, areas in which the festival is supposed to demonstrate supreme expertise. Alas, not much of that has been in evidence. Both casts have an 'all-purpose international' look about them, with several principals previously unknown in Sussex: the suspicion that they may have been tailored by suggestions from EMI (who were rumoured to be recording all three shows) is doubtless unworthy, but I cannot suppress it. Neither Andrew Davis's conducting of Berlioz nor Roger Norrington's of Beethoven produced the impeccable, 'lived-in' orchestral playing that comes from long, purposeful rehearsal. The reliance of the Berlioz cast on their scores was in some cases worryingly intimate. But then, in artistic terms the whole evening veered at times close to disaster. Berlioz's speech-song mixture can work very well in concert (as in this hall Simon Rattle and Neville Marriner have already proved), yet Glyndebourne has chosen to intersperse the numbers with a narration of brain-numbing witlessness by John Wells, delivered by the author himself in a uniquely embarrassing collection of schoolboy-comic 'funny voices'. This cast a pall over the proceedings that only a company of Berlioz Titans could have lifted. Andrew Davis is not that: too soft-edged. Neither - thus far, at least - are Anne-Sofie von Otter and Jerry Hadley in the title roles or Dawn Upshaw (Hero), though all three hinted at qualities to make one optimistic about future development. Jean Rigby's Ursula showed her experience and the sumptuous beauty of her mezzo. The guying of Somarone's comic chorus by means of exaggeratedly bad tuning was shaming. There was more life in the Fidelio. As we know from his Kent Opera production, Norrington's conducting of it is original, energetic, exciting: he seats the orchestra in correctly 'classical' figuration, and bright, dramatically pertinent contributions from wind and brass were his (and our) continual reward. Unfortunately, his was not a view of the opera that sat comfortably on most of the cast - routined, lacklustre heavyweights with (in some cases) distinctly worn voices at their disposal. (The conductor was a late replacement for Klaus Tennstedt, who had been forced by illness to withdraw a few weeks ago.) Peter Seiffert's youthfully strong Florestan and the appealing Marzelline and Jacquino of Barbara Bonney and John Mark Ainsley were the exceptions to that disappointing general vocal rule. Berlioz and Beethoven performances at Royal Festival Hall until Saturday; Merry Widow July 18, 20, 22</p>

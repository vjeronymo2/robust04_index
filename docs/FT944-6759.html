			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / World Bond Markets: Borrowers cash in on tumbling prices - Syndicated loans Underwriters for the jumbo Dollars 5bn loan for the Kingdom of Sweden should be lined up this week, and the deal will then go out to syndication. To judge by recent events in the syndicated loans market, it will receive an enthusiastic response, even at the keen price of 8 basis points over London interbank offered rate (Libor), and should be signed by Christmas. Sweden is the latest beneficiary of tumbling prices in the lending market, where margins have fallen by up to 50 per cent in the past year. It has moved early to refinance two outstanding loans, both maturing next year and costing 15 to 25 basis points over Libor. Ms Christine Holm of the Swedish National Debt Office said: 'Pricing in loans has come down and that on bonds has increased since the beginning of the year. For us it is an excellent opportunity as it gives us cheaper finance than we have outstanding.' International borrowers are not alone in exploiting current low pricing. East Midlands Electricity, the UK power utility, moved early and asked Chemical Bank to arrange the refinancing for a loan maturing next September, and obtained a price of 15 basis points over Libor for the Pounds 350m, five-year deal. Although the low price raised eyebrows in the syndicated loans market, in the end the deal was oversubscribed but not increased. Mrs Lesley Hamer, treasurer of East Midlands, said: 'We were oversubscribed a fair amount and had to scale back. Obviously, there are banks prepared to lend at that level, and we are very pleased with the group of banks we have got.' She said there are 13 banks in the loan, 'three European, two US, and eight Japanese'. East Midlands may have set a benchmark with the deal, which replaced a loan taken out at 15 basis points over Libor in September 1990, just days before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait sent pricing up. Intense competition among banks for assets has since driven pricing back down, which in turn has sparked a rush to the loans market. This has been charted by the Bank for International Settlements' latest quarterly report on financial market trends*. The BIS report details the seemingly inexorable rise of the syndicated loan. While rising from Dollars 136.7bn in 1991 to Dollars 221bn in both 1992 and 1993 and Dollars 177.6bn in the first three-quarters of this year, syndicated loans remain behind bonds but are increasing in popularity as bond markets become more turbulent. Globally, bond issuance remains larger than loans, with Dollars 333bn of completed bond deals in 1992, Dollars 438bn in 1993 and Dollars 309.7bn in the first nine months of this year. More specifically, in the US and the UK, syndicated loans remain streets ahead of bonds. The total of international bonds by UK and US issuers was the equivalent of Dollars 53bn in 1992, Dollars 59bn in 1993 and Dollars 51.8bn for the first three-quarters of this year. In the US and the UK, loans were the equivalent of Dollars 117bn in 1992, Dollars 105bn in all of 1993 and rose to Dollars 121.5bn in the first three-quarters of 1994. The increasing popularity of loans stems partly from the fall in the price of bonds and the consequent rise in the interest paid on them, or their yields. Earlier this year, Lloyds Bank brought a loan to the market for 3i, the UK investment group, at close to the pricing of 3i sterling bond issues. As well as low pricing, borrowers are also attracted by the flexibility of loans. Much of the financing for the Foinaven oilfield in the Atlantic off the Shetland and Orkney islands will be arranged through a Dollars 250m syndicated loan, being arranged by Chase and Chemical Bank, which have agreed to underwrite it. The loan will finance the production of a floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) system. Bankers met on Thursday to discuss the loan, which is expected to be for seven years priced at some 100 basis points over Libor. Mr Kaare Gisvold, president of Golar-Nor, the Norwegian company behind the FPSO, said: 'Apart from pricing, it is flexibility that makes bank funding more attractive for this kind of thing.' However, when it comes to choice between a bond and a syndicated loan, pricing is undoubtedly behind the return to favour of lending. One driving force behind the fall in pricing is the presence in the market of Japanese banks, which have turned aggressively to overseas lending in the face of a weak domestic market. It may be no coincidence that eight Japanese banks are in the syndicate that provided the keenly-priced loan to East Midlands but to judge from the current crop of bank results from Tokyo, Japanese banks seem to be enduring a grim period. Rival syndicated loans teams may be searching Japanese banks' accounts for signs that trouble at home will lead to less of an appetite for foreign adventures. Whether company treasurers will take the same attitude is debatable. * International Banking and Financial Market Developments, by the Bank for International Settlements, Basle.</p>

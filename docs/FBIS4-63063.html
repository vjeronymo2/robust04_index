			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Demidetskiy] </F>   [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau] May 19 TASS -- The Moldavian  [Moldovan] leadership "will do everything in its power to expand  friendly and cooperative relations with democratic Russia, which  considers Moldovia to be an equal, proper, and responsible  partner," Moldavian Foreign Minister Sergey Popov stressed in an  interview broadcast over Kishinev Radio on Thursday [19 May].    However, Popov expressed his regret that the agreement on  the  basis of inter-governmental relations between Moldavia and  Russia, which was concluded three years ago, has still not been  ratified by the Russian parliament. "At the present time, the  parliamentary foreign affairs commission is searching for ways  out of this dead end together with colleagues in the Russian  parliament."    The foreign minister confirmed that his country's official  stance regarding the 14th Russian Army, stationed in Moldova,  has not changed. "We are for the unconditional, complete, and  immediate withdrawal of that Army from the Republic's territory."    The next round of the Moldovan-Russian talks on the  withdrawal of the 14th Army is scheduled to be held at the end  of May or the beginning of June, ITAR-TASS was told by the  Moldovan Foreign Ministry.    The membership of the Moldovan delegation has been  significantly altered. The former delegation head, Moldavian  Ambassador to Russia Anatoliy Tsaran, resigned his post, and so  will probably be replaced by Deputy Foreign Minister Nikolay  Osmokescu.    ITAR-TASS learned from reliable sources that government and  other departmental representatives will also be replaced. This  may have a significant effect on the negotiations, which have  not witnessed any progress for the past several months, the  sources noted.    The Russian delegation has tied the withdrawal of the 14th  Army with the resolution of the Dniester armed conflict and the  granting of special legal status to the Tiraspol-based  rebellious region.    Reliable sources in the Russian delegation told ITAR-TASS  that the previous Moldavian delegation did not have a  particularly constructive attitude and was callous towards the  Dniester representatives, who were present at the talks as  observers.</p>

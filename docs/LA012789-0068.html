			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRIVATE CARE FOR THE RETARDED  </P> <P> As a parent of a retarded child in Lanterman State Hospital, I would like to  thank Hurst for his well-researched, informative series. We have always  believed our daughter received excellent care there. Many of the staff on her  ward have been there 8 to 10 years and longer, which indicates to me that  working conditions must be decent. In addition, our daughter is happy and well  cared for and healthy.  </P> <P> They take her outings, buy her new clothes (with her SSI money), and take  pictures of her various activities. They take great pride in her ward, painting  and wallpapering during their off-hours and are now beginning a parents' group.  </P> <P> But each year at our annual evaluation, the subject of community care comes up.  We have always believed she is not a good candidate for this as she is very low  functioning (about 3-year-old motor IQ -- and profoundly deaf). After reading  Hurst's descriptions of community placement, which confirms what we had already  heard, we shall continue to hold out strongly for keeping her where she is  indeed "blossoming."  </P> <P> CLAIRE MARMION  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

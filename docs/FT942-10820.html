			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Survey of Biotechnology (2): Location a high priority - Local facilities and regulations are important For such a young sapling of an industry, biotechnology has already rooted itself firmly in specific locations, and today's thriving centres will probably continue to dominate in the future. The US holds the lion's share of the business, with more than 1,500 biotechnology companies. Europe, in contrast, has less than 250 operations, including university research programmes and pharmaceutical company subsidiaries. A handful of firms also dot Canada, Australia and Japan. Within countries, too, biotechnology tends to cluster in specific regions. The areas around San Francisco and Boston are the undisputed capitals of the sector in the US. A research corridor also extends along the eastern seaboard from Rhode Island to North Carolina, and spots along the West Coast, including Los Angeles, San Diego and Seattle, have attracted a number of firms. In Europe, Britain is emerging as the biotechnology king, with centres in Oxford, Cambridge, Scotland and London. Industry executives predict that future growth will be focused in these areas. 'After a while, the business begins to feed on itself,' says Kenneth Bate, head of sales at the Boston-based group Biogen. 'Biotechnology firms want to be where the other biotechnology firms are. Scientists like to talk with each other, and there's a lot of cross-fertilisation that goes on.' The attractions which drew the biotechnology sector to these locations will continue to act as magnets in the future: a friendly regulatory stance, access to capital, proximity to universities and hospitals, the presence of a skilled labour pool and nearby airports and highways. Regulatory procedures are the most changeable of these factors. Overly bureaucratic requirements can put a death seal on a developing biotechnology centre. Germany's antagonistic stance toward the sector has seriously limited its ability to compete as a biotechnology contender, for instance. Citing overly zealous regulatory restrictions in Germany, Bayer, Boehringer Mannheim and Hoechst have all established biotechnology operations in the US. 'It would take us at least two years to get permission to build a lab in Germany,' says Dieter Bauer, expert on biotechnology research and development at Hoechst. 'In the US, we got approval for the building in about five weeks, and everything else happened very quickly.' The development of biotechnology in Britain has also been hurt by regulatory restrictions. Companies in the sector complain that until two years ago, flotation requirements for the London Stock Exchange included a five-year track record and three years of profits. Since the rules changed, life has become much easier for UK firms. British Biotechnology floated in mid-1992 and a number of other companies have followed the group to market. 'We negotiated criteria more appropriate to a biotechnology group,' says Keith McCullagh, chief executive of British Biotechnology. Biotechnology companies usually do not show profits for years after their inception. The UK sector now seems ready for growth, and executives hope the new, friendlier climate will halt the brain drain of British scientists to the US. But many believe it will take the country years to overcome the damage done by the previous regulatory structure. 'The environment in the UK has changed tremendously, but we're still at least eight years behind the US in terms of developing a biotechnology industry,' Mr McCullagh says. Regional and local regulations can also make a difference. A few years ago, the state government of Massachusetts became concerned that a slow permitting process was undermining its status as a biotechnology mecca. The biotechnology company Genzyme was threatening to leave the state, and other groups were filing similar complaints. In the end, Massachusetts succeeded in keeping Genzyme in the state by allocating ombudsmen to take biotechnology companies swiftly through the regulatory procedures. 'We wanted a commitment from the government to work together with us on the permitting and approval process,' says Geoffrey Cox, senior vice-president in charge of world operations at Genzyme. 'This is a big issue and can have an enormous financial impact on a firm. If it's your first product, for instance, all the months you're waiting for approval for a plant you're not selling anything.' Massachusetts also sweetened the Genzyme deal with tax breaks. Indeed, financing issues have become crucial in siting decisions. British company Celltech, for example, decided to build a US manufacturing plant in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, after the state made the group an offer its says it could not refuse. 'We got tremendous financial assistance from the state of New Hampshire,' says Peter Fellner, Celltech's chief executive officer. 'It was far more than we could have got in Europe, and a better deal than other regions in the US were offering.' Biotechnology groups also like to be near their investor bases and their market, two factors favouring growth in the US. 'Most biotechnology groups will have to set up branches in the US at some point,' said Mark McDade, chief operating officer for Boehringer Mannheim Therapeutics. 'We set up here because we needed to address the needs of the largest, most profitable pharmaceutical market in the world.' British Biotechnology says it established a branch in the US in part because it wanted to be near investors. 'About 18 per cent of our shareholders are in the US, so it's good for investor relations for us to be here,' says McCullagh. Other factors weigh into companies' decisions about where to locate. The availability of a skilled labour pool for instance, easy access to air and road transportation and quality of life, which helps firms attract the best people, are mentioned as important considerations. Because these factors are often slow to change, industry executives believe a growth bias will favour existing centres. 'Regulatory structures, being near universities, all these are important in making the decision about where to locate, probably more important than which places are the cheapest,' says Mr Cox of Genzyme. 'That's why I think that the south-west and north-east of the US, even though they are relatively expensive places to do business, will continue to be magnets for the biotechnology industry.'</p>

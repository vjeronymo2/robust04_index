			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Argentina plans car export drive Argentina's six car and truck manufacturers plan sharply to increase exports to about Dollars 650m (Pounds 351.3m) a year and invest Dollars 1.6bn over the next three years as part of a mandatory investment and modernisation plan, writes John Barham in Buenos Aires. Six months ago, the government told the companies it would relax import barriers as part of a new export-oriented policy. It also instructed manufacturers to draw up detailed investment plans showing how they would adapt to liberalisation. The policy includes requirements for each company to run a positive trade balance by 1994, reduce its range of models and concentrate production on modern vehicles for export.</p>

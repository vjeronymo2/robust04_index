			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CD CORNER: COMPILATIONS SPOTLIGHT CLASSICS  </P> <P> Ever wonder what the pop hit parade sounded like just before the rock 'n' roll  explosion?  </P> <P> "Radio Classics of the '50s," just released by Columbia Records, wasn't  designed to answer that curiosity because Elvis Presley and Little Richard were  already dominating the pop charts by the time several of these 14 selections  (including Johnny Mathis' "Chances Are" and Johnny Horton's "The Battle of New  Orleans") were on the charts.  </P> <P> The reason the 40-minute package -- whose other selections range from Tony  Bennett's "Rags to Riches" and Rosemary Clooney's "Hey There" to Doris Day's  "Whatever Will Be, Will Be (Que Sera, Sera)" and Frankie Laine's "High Noon" --  serves as a sampler of pre-rock pop is that Columbia Records didn't begin  signing rock acts until the early '60s.  </P> <P> There are some other noteworthy moments in "Radio Classics" (including Marty  Robbins' "El Paso" and Louis Armstrong's "Mack the Knife"), but the only record  with a trace of the raw intensity of rock was Johnnie Ray's R&amp;B-influenced  "Cry," a highly influential 1951 hit that is often overlooked in discussions of  the evolution of rock.  </P> <P> "Radio Classics" is part of a new budget series of nostalgic albums from  Columbia. Each package contains colorful liner notes that detail the histories  of the records involved, though the dividing line between pop and rock in some  of the collections is fuzzy.  </P> <P> The other Columbia budget collections available in CD: "Pop Classics of the  '60s" (34-minutes, ranging from O.C. Smith's "Little Green Apples" to the  Byrds' "Mr. Tambourine Man"), "Rock Classics of the '60s" (41 minutes, from  Santana's "Evil Ways" to Bob Dylan's "Rainy Day Women . . ."), "Pop Classics of  the '70s" (44 minutes, from Toto's "Hold the Line" to Dr. Hook's "Sylvia's  Mother"), "Rock Classics of the '70s" (52 minutes, from Mountain's "Mississippi  Queen" to Janis Joplin's "Me and Bobby McGee).  </P> <P> Another new compilation from RCA Records focuses on the Broadway pop tradition.  </P> <P> "Showstoppers" is a generous, 64-minute sampler of Broadway tunes, mostly from  the '20s and '30s. The selections range from Fanny Brice's "Second-Hand Rose"  and Paul Robeson's "Ol' Man River" to composers Cole Porter and Harold Arlen  offering their own vocal interpretations of their respective "You're the Top"  and "Stormy Weather."  </P></p>

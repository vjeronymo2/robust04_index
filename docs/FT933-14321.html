			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Italy shocked by demand to recall general THE ITALIAN government yesterday reacted with a mixture of astonishment and wounded pride at the demand by the United Nations for the recall of General Bruno Loi, commander of Italy's 2,400-strong contingent in Somalia. The call for the general's withdrawal promised to set Italy on its most public diplomatic row with its major allies in recent years. In parliament there were demands for an immediate response and further questions about the possible recall of the entire Italian peacekeeping force in Somalia. Mr Beniamino Andreatta, the foreign minister, said he was 'astounded' by the behaviour of Mr Kofi Annan, the official in charge of all UN peacekeeping operations, who demanded the removal of Gen Loi in a New York press conference. The foreign minister indicated Mr Annan spoke in direct contradiction to an understanding agreed with Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general. Mr Andreatta told parliament he had discussed the position of Gen Loi in a telephone conversation with Mr Boutros Ghali on Tuesday. He said it was clear the UN secretary-general wanted to bring forward the rotation of Gen Loi, and they had both talked about this being done in August. This would then give the Italian government time to study the situation, Mr Andreatta told parliament. However, the Ciampi government was last night being forced to choose between obliging the UN and the US, the main power behind the peacekeeping operation in Somalia, and closing ranks behind Gen Loi and behind the increasingly divergent Italian view of how to handle matters in the former colony. On Tuesday, the government indicated that Italian forces should be withdrawn from Mogadishu, the Somali capital. This was to avoid being seen as an 'occupation force'. The Italian authorities insist that the operation in Somalia has lost sight of its original humanitarian and peacekeeping mission. At the same time the Italian troops are not fully equipped for combat roles in peace enforcement. Gen Loi was quoted as saying: 'I am perfectly at ease with my conscience. I have acted according to the spirit and letter of the UN mission.' In private, there is some admission from officials that Gen Loi may not have acted in consultation with the UN command, Unisom. But they also point out the Americans themselves have consulted little. The Italian government is also sensitive to international criticism of the role of its troops since this is their first combat mission since the second world war. So far three Italian soldiers have been killed and more than 20 wounded.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] LITERATURNAYA ROSSIYA is in danger!    Deprived of state subsidies, with no other means of  financial  support, and put in the position of a "blockade-raiser,"  independent LITERATURNAYA ROSSIYA is experiencing severe  financial difficulties. The editorial team has done everything  within its power to weather the constant rise in the exorbitant  prices of printing services, newsprint, and so forth. Whatever  cost thousands yesterday already costs a million today, and  whatever used to cost a million now costs 8-10 million.    We are appealing for aid from all those who grew to love and  need LITERATURNAYA ROSSIYA in the last few years. The  disappearance of a newspaper which has consistently defended the  principles of Russian statehood and state dignity, and which is  now in the midst of a fierce confrontation with all those who  are disgracing and destroying Russia, will be an irretrievable  loss.    This loss would be another example of the annihilators'  skill  in dislodging the strong props of Russia's substructure and the  foundation of our common Russian home.    We hope we can rely on the support of entrepreneurs and  businessmen in Russia and on the empathy of our readers.    The commercial account of the editorial offices in the  Business Commercial Bank is MFO 201638 IPO Writers (with the  notation: for LITERATURNAYA ROSSIYA).    Our readers in any part of Russia and the CIS can transfer  whatever amount they can spare to that account. Muscovites  should transfer funds to the following: Business Commercial  Bank, MFO 44583478, acct. 74, 129110 IPO Writers (indicating:  for LITERATURNAYA ROSSIYA).</p>

			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / CBI reports poor prospects for manufacturing PROSPECTS for a recovery in UK manufacturing remain weak, with only two regions expecting a 'slight' improvement in orders and output during the next four months. Only the north-west of England and the west Midlands - one of the regions worst affected by the recession - expect a small rise in orders, while manufacturing companies elsewhere expect production to remain flat or to deteriorate. The lastest findings of the Confederation of British Industry and Business Strategies survey of regional industrial trends add to the bleak picture of the UK economy painted by the Bank of England in its Quarterly Bulletin earlier this week. The Bank admitted the economy was still in recession and did not predict when an upturn would occur. Although little change in output or demand was expected over the next four months, the CBI survey points towards a reshuffle in the fortunes of the 11 regions. Scotland, which has appeared to withstand the manufacturing recession comparatively well, expects a sharper than average fall in orders and output. The survey said Scotland was helped by the boom in North Sea safety and technical work but now appeared to be slipping into a weaker position. Scotland also recorded the biggest fall in optimism about prospects. Along with the north of England, the south-east and the west Midlands, this severe pessimism reflected the gloomy outlook for exports, the survey said. Overall optimism, which rose marginally in the previous survey, declined. The steepest fall in new orders in the past four months was in the west Midlands, Scotland and Wales. Total orders fell in every region - a finding at odds with expectations expressed in the last survey. The CBI said the sharp fall in demand caught many companies by surprise, one reason being the failure of export orders to live up to expectations. One result of the recession has been a striking change in the distribution of manufacturing activity. Before the recession, levels of capacity utilisation were lowest in Scotland and the north. Now they enjoy the highest rates while the south-east, Wales, East Anglia and the west Midlands are more likely to have companies working below full capacity. The survey predicted declines in investment in plant in all regions bar the east Midlands, where little change was expected. All regions expressed positive intentions to invest in training.

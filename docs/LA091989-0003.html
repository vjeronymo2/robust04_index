			<p><P> September 19, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> REACTION TO PENDLETON PRESERVATION PLAN MIXED  </P> <P> An attempt by a volunteer urban-planning and environmental group to protect  Camp Pendleton from private development, both for the sake of wildlife there  and so the land will continue to serve as a buffer to Orange County's urban  sprawl, has won at least one supporter in Congress.  </P> <P> Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego) has said he will introduce legislation to preserve  the area as open space by requiring that, "if and when the United States Marine  Corps ever vacates" any or all of the 125,000-acre base, the land will remain  under federal control and be dedicated as a national park or wildlife preserve  for several endangered species.  </P> <P> However, the proposal was met with apprehension from the Marine Corps and was  downright criticized by another member of San Diego's delegation in Washington  who believes it would be counterproductive to the goal of keeping the base  under federal ownership.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hates the Mere Suggestion  </P> <P> Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad), whose district includes the sprawling base, said  through a spokesman that he opposes Bates' bill because of its mere suggestion  that Camp Pendleton might one day be abandoned by the military.  </P> <P> Packard "doesn't feel there's any need for this kind of legislation," said  David Coggin, his chief of staff. "He has long said that Camp Pendleton will be  a Marine base well into his great-grandchildren's lifetime. If we start doing  bills like this, it gives people the notion that maybe it should be closed. It  would establish a fait accompli to developers or others who want to put an  airport there.  </P> <P> "The congressman is very adamant that he would not introduce, and would not  support, legislation in this regard, because it's totally unnecessary."  </P> <P> Bates' reply is:  </P> <P> "I don't understand his logic at all. The bill makes it clear that the base  would not be developed with residential, commercial or industrial uses.  </P> <P> "I don't anticipate anything ever happening to Camp Pendleton, and I don't  think this bill is a signal that we're pushing them out. But, given the  changing military needs in our country, if, in the distant future there should  be a change, we want to be ready for it. This bill simply lays the groundwork  to ensure that this land remains in public hands, for use as a park and for  wildlife."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Continuous Swath  </P> <P> The legislation is sought by the San Diego group Citizens Coordinate for  Century 3, or C3, which fears that the forces of rampant growth are so great in  Southern California that, in time, corridors between San Diego County and the  counties of Riverside and Orange will be a continuous swath of housing tracts  and commercial development.  </P> <P> The group maintains that Camp Pendleton serves as both a physical and  psychological barrier in preventing the so-called Los Angelization of San Diego  and a worst-case scenario that all of Southern California may one day be  integrated as a suburb of that city.  </P> <P> Don Wood, president of C3, said last week that he is delighted by Bates'  proposed legislation and confused by Packard's opposition.  </P> <P> "There are already piecemeal attempts by developers and others to pull out  pieces of the base -- for oil drilling, for toll roads, for airports," Wood  said. "The base has an entire office dedicated to encroachment problems like  these.  </P> <P> "If this bill passes, then anytime the Marines declare any portion of the base  as surplus, it would not be available for developers to rip off for private,  commercial development," he said. "Passage of the bill would decrease the  number of attempts to encroach there. It strengthens, not weakens, the Marine  position because it takes away the incentive for private interests to try to  rip the base off.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'We Like the Marines'  </P> <P> "We want to make it very clear that we like the Marines being there," Wood  said. "They have the current ability to keep developers off their land because  they have guns. But what if the Marines ever do leave?"  </P> <P> Wood said he hopes Packard "will turn around when he sees the value this bill  would have to the Marines, whom he purports to support."  </P> <P> Today, San Diego County Supervisor John MacDonald, whose North County district  includes Camp Pendleton, will ask other board members to adopt a generic  resolution echoing Bates' position on the base's future.  </P> <P> Bates himself has not decided when he will introduce the bill; in the meantime,  he is circulating drafts of it to environmental groups for reaction.  </P> <P> He said some environmentalists have told him that it is not worded strongly  enough and that it should stipulate that Camp Pendleton automatically become  national parkland or a wildlife preserve.  </P> <P> Bates said he backed down from the stronger wording in favor of first calling  for a review by the Department of the Interior.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Congress Has Final Say  </P> <P> The legislation would require the Secretary of the Interior to make a  recommendation to Congress that "will provide for the maximum preservation of  the Camp Pendleton property" under the management of Interior, Bates said.  Congress would make the ultimate decree under terms of the bill.  </P> <P> "I think the bill has a better chance of passage with that review process  included in it," he said.  </P> <P> U. S. Sen. Pete Wilson (R-San Diego), according to his staff, will not  introduce his own legislation in the Senate, but is willing to support Bates'  bill.  </P> <P> "Pete Wilson's position is that the base is not going to ever be closed,  period. It's a vital key to our national military interests and to the local  community," said Wilson spokeswoman Lynda Schuler. "No one has ever talked  seriously of closing it, and we see no reason why it would change, unless we  establish world peace tomorrow. It's a critical base, and it will be there as  long as we need the U. S. Marine Corps.  </P> <P> "He doesn't object to the proposal (by Bates), but we have no plans to follow  suit," she said.  </P> <P> Wood, of C3, said he is confused by Packard's position because "we were told  earlier by his staff that they could see their way to support the bill if the  Marines did, too."  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Busy Place  </P> <P> For its part, the Marine Corps said Bates' proposal "is a well-intentioned and  appreciated effort to preserve valuable environmental resources."  </P> <P> But Camp Pendleton spokesman Lt. Col. John Shotwell noted that the base is the  busiest training facility of any Defense Department installation. "We don't  envision a time when Camp Pendleton, with its unique and ideal features for  amphibious and other types of military training, would not be vital to our  nation's defense," he said.  </P> <P> "Further, we think it speculative at best to legislate a destiny for the  property during some future unknown era when some other use may be in the  public's best interest.  </P> <P> "We are also apprehensive," Shotwell said, "that such legislation could  potentially hamper our current use and activities at Camp Pendleton. We are  concerned there may be activities under way here, or facilities planned for  construction, that could themselves be challenged as being incompatible with  what a national park should have. We're also concerned that there may be  additional layers of bureaucracy placed on us, as far as our own future plans,  growth and development, in order to get our own projects approved."  </P> <P> He noted, too, that a 1972 federal law already gives Congress control over the  disposition of the base.  </P> <P> Camp Pendleton, which stretches along 17 miles of oceanfront and backs up 10  miles inland to the Cleveland National Forest and the Santa Margarita  Mountains, is the only Marine base in the country where the military can  simultaneously practice amphibious assaults, troop maneuvers and aircraft  bombing runs with live ordnance.  </P> <P> The base also serves as a host to a herd of 50 bison and such endangered birds  as the California least tern, the light-footed clapper rail, Belding's savannah  sparrow, California brown pelican and the least Bell's vireo.  </P></p>

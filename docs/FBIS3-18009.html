			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Premier Carl Bildt was today on a brief visit to  Riga, the capital of Latvia, and his aim was to try to speed up  the agreement on the Russian withdrawal of troops from Latvia.  [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] The agreement exists on paper, but the  Latvian Government has not taken a final decision on it and  there is strong opposition in the parliament to some of the  points in the agreement. One stumbling block has been the  Russian radar base in Skrunda in west Latvia, but that is  allowed to remain during a dismantling period of approximately  five years. Bildt said that Sweden can think of economically  assisting the dismantling. [passage omitted on Latvia's problem  with retired Russian military personnel]    During his visit to Riga, Bildt held meetings with President  Guntis Ulmanis and Premier Valdis Birkavs and representatives of  the opposition. Russia is not treating its former obedient  Latvia with enough respect. The Latvians for their part must  understand that Latvians have most to gain from an agreement  with the Russians -- that was Bildt's message. This is what  Bildt said on what was discussed in Riga today:.    [begin Bildt recording] We have discussed the continuing  process and this means both the process toward Russia -- where a  meeting between President Ulmanis and President Yeltsin is  currently being prepared, where certain outstanding questions  will be solved -- and the process which must continue when we  are creating increased understanding both in Latvia and in  western countries for the Latvian security situation and  concerns.

			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / World Bond Markets: Tokyo The breakdown of last Friday's trade talks between Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japanese prime minister, and Mr Bill Clinton, US president, may be good news for the Japanese bond market. The yen, which closed in Tokyo at Y108.25 on Thursday, jumped to Y106 against the dollar in New York following the failure of the US-Japan talks on anticipation that US officials will support a stronger Japanese currency to try and curb Japanese exports. This may lead to lower Japanese interest rates, as the Bank of Japan will want to avoid the negative impact of the higher yen on the stock market ahead of the March book closing and will ease short-term money market rates. With traders looking for excuses to buy bonds now that concerns of over-supply from the income tax cut and economic stimulus package financing are finally discounted into prices, the market may be set for a mini-rally. The No 157 10-year benchmark, which closed at 3.46 per cent last Thursday, may fall to 3.3 per cent. Although some banks and corporate investors will continue to take profits on their holdings to supplement their earnings ahead of the March year-end, the outlook on the economy still looks gloomy and long-term bond yields may fall along with short-term interest rates.</p>

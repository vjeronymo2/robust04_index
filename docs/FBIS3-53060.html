			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "A Positive Step on a Long Path"] </F>   [Text] We receive the Jordanian-Palestinian agreement with  much optimism, hope, and confidence in the future. We also look  forward to further clear and strong relations based on  confidence and cooperation between two peoples who have the same  aspirations, objectives, and march. This march is embodied in  unbreakable ties linking our kinsfolk on the eastern and western  sides of the River [Jordan].    The success that has been achieved comes to crown and  respond  to His Majesty King Husayn's directives, calls, and wise views  regarding the need to establish clear, firm, and serious  Jordanian-Palestinian relations. It also comes as a response to  King Husayn's eagerness that bilateral coordination should  actually be entrenched on the ground and not on paper, and that  the sons of our one people should feel both the results and  positive aspects of this agreement in their practical daily life  and not in words and wishes.    The current formula of this agreement affirms that the  Jordanian and Palestinian leaderships wish to outline the  features of joint cooperation in the face of developments, and  that they also want to confront the challenges and dangers of  this phase. This agreement fulfills our masses' aspirations for  preserving the elements of their existence and safeguarding a  free future and a decent life for their generations. Such a  life would put the interests of Jordanians and Palestinians  within a bilateral framework and give them a pan-Arab dimension  away from the Israeli attempts to control the destinies of the  two peoples and confiscate the free and independent Palestinian  decisionmaking.    The common interest of both peoples requires circumventing  all the residues and repercussions of the previous phase. It  also requires removing the seeds of doubt and mistrust which the  Israelis are trying to plant in a clear Arab soil. This fact,  whose political and economic dimensions were affirmed by His  Majesty King Husayn last week, has imposed itself on the  atmosphere of the talks and disappointed all those who wagered  on the inability of both sides to overcome obstacles. It has  also disappointed those who believed that bilateral dialogue and  interpretations would develop into a state of estrangement and  differences, so they would realize their dreams, ambitions, and  conspiracies.    The Jordanian-Palestinian agreement--along with the economic  and financial cooperation issues it addresses--constitutes a  step on a long path. However, it is a large and serious step  and is part of a larger framework which would pave the way for  agreement on all issues that are being raised and that concern  the supreme interests of both sides such as Jerusalem, the  refugees and displaced people, water, borders, and security in a  spirit of joint responsibility and concern for the principles of  coordination, solidarity, and cohesion in the battle of peace in  order to regain both the occupied territories and the usurped  rights.    The Jordanian leadership and people have always stood  alongside the Palestinian brothers in their just and legitimate  struggle to regain their territories, rights, sovereignty over  their national soil, and free self-determination. Moreover,  King Husayn's affirmations of continued adherence to this  pan-Arab principle as part of Jordan's policy on the Palestine  question will increase confidence that the march will proceed.  This is because the agreement greatly embodies the fateful  solidarity which links Jordan and Palestine. This solidarity  also prompts the sons of our one people to champion the brothers  and kinsfolk in the occupied territories and holy Jerusalem.  The agreement also increases confidence that this cohesive  march will continue and be enhanced despite all obstacles,  challenges, and pressures on various levels and in all fields.  It is hoped that the framework of this march will expand under  a more comprehensive Arab coordination and on all fronts of  confrontation with the enemy as part of the battle for peace and  survival.</p>

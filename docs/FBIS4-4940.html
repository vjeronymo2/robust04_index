			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Kim Ik-hyon and Kang Yong-chin] </F>   [Text] Security-related ministers held a six-hour long  emergency meeting at the prime minister's residence in  Samchong-tong, Seoul on 5 April to discuss countermeasures on  the North Korean nuclear issue following the U.S. request that  the ROK concede on the issue of exchanging North-South special  envoys, a precondition for the third round of North Korean-U.S.  talks, in an effort to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue.  Failing to reach any consensus, however, the government is  having trouble coming up with a clear position on this issue.    A righ-ranking government official disclosed that Prime  Minister Yi Hoe-chang, Yi Yong-tok, deputy prime minister and  unification board minister, Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, Kim  Tok, National Security Planning Agency Director, and Yi  Chong-uk, senior presidential secretary for foreign and national  security affairs, gathered at the prime minister's official  residence and extensively discussed measures regarding nuclear  negotiations with North Korea from 1600 [0700 GMT] to 2200 [1300  GMT] that day, but failed to reach any conclusion.    Following Foreign Minister Han's briefing on his trip to the  United States, discussion centered around the U.S. suggestions  for concession on the issue of exchanging North-South special  envoys, and resumption of the Team Spirit military exercise.    According to a source, two very different views conflicted  with one another at the meeting: While some argued that  conceding on the issue of exchanging North-South special envoys  so that North Korea- U.S. talks can proceed and, North Korea can  be lead to receive nuclear inspections was a realistic way to  resolving the nuclear issue, others insisted on not giving up on  North-South dialogue.    It was learned that those in favor of conceding, noted the  atmosphere in the international community and the United States  of placing more importance on the realization of North  Korea-U.S. talks as they feel that the UN action resulted from  the International Atomic Energy agency's [IAEA] inspections and  not the lack of progress in North-South dialogue.    Those opposed to any concession argued that conceding would  appear as though our side were being dragged along by North  Korea's tactics to delay talks and warned of public criticism of  the government for repeated concessions to North Korea.    In a recent letter in the name of Kang Sok-chu, vice foreign  minister and senior delegate of the North Korean side to North  Korea-U.S. talks, to Robert Gallucci, U.S. Assistant Secretary  of State and U.S. side's senior delegate, the North Korean side  said that "if the United States does not link the holding of a  third round of North Korea-U.S. talks with the exchange of  North-South special envoys, which was put forward as a  precondition for the talks, North Korea will accept additional  inspections by the IAEA." Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher pointed out that "acceptance [of North Korean  demand] is the only realistic method to breaking the current  situation," and asked the ROK side to consider it.    Citing domestic sentiments, however, Foreign Minister Han  reportedly expressed an opposing view.    Discussing how the situation must appear to the public with  the confusion within the government pertaining to the  negotiation strategy on the North Korean nuclear issue, another  source revealed that the security-related ministers agreed on  the need to fine tune the government's position, and decided to  adjust flexibly to developments in the situation while adhering  to existing policies.    Participants at the meeting also voiced concern over the  possibility of Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong's recent  remarks on the possibility of considering a plan to withdraw the  demand to exchange North-South special envoys, upsetting  government policy.</p>

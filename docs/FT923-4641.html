			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Share prices fall in turbulent trading ATTEMPTS at a more considered reaction in UK equities to the British government's Pounds 3.75bn plan for sterling support were overwhelmed yesterday by new developments on the global currency stage. Share prices ended the trading account sharply lower after an extremely erratic session. The lead came from currency and futures markets, as they grappled with an increase in Italian discount rates and alarming unemployment figures from the US which sent the dollar sharply downwards. The sterling support plan announced on Thursday was seen as, at best, buying time until the Maastricht referendum in France on September 20. But a No vote in France would still imply pressure on the pound and revive fears that rates will be forced higher if intervention cannot sustain the currency. Equities opened higher yesterday as sterling topped the important DM2.80 level but peaked early at FT-SE 2,396.4. By then, the generally cautious response to the funding plan was taking effect and sentiment was further discouraged by the 1.75-point rise in the discount rate in Italy. However, the hardest blow came at mid-session with the disclosure that jobs in the US had fallen by 83,000 in August; 'a disaster,' said US watchers. Sterling wilted on the cross rates as the dollar fell away and the Footsie soon showed a loss of nearly 30 points. Later, when Wall Street opened relatively calmly, London rallied to give a final reading on the FT-SE Index of 2,362.2, a loss of 19.7. Volatility in share prices reflected similar trends in stock index futures and in the short sterling contract. Dealers said that the institutions had again stayed on the sidelines, and that trading had been very difficult, with marketmakers struggling to avoid taking stock on their books. However, gilts opened slowly turning higher later as the market took a favourable view of the near term outlook. At the close, long gilts were around up. Seaq turnover of 546.7m shares compared with 551.3m on Thursday when retail business was worth Pounds 978.5m. Market sentiment was jolted yesterday when SG Warburg withdrew from dealing in 362 smaller company shares. At Strauss Turnbull, Mr Ian Harnett cut UK growth and earnings forecasts and commented that the outlook must now depend heavily on a Yes vote in France and no change in UK interest rates. Retail business has remained exceedingly volatile as currency uncertainty has kept the institutions on the sidelines.</p>

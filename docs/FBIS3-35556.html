The text of  the statement is as follows.    In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful. The  cabinet of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran  strongly condemns the brutal atrocity by the Zionists in the  shrine of His Holiness Ebrahim-e Khalil, peace be upon him,  which ended in the martyrdom and wounding of hundreds of fasting  Palestinian Muslims. It considers the slaughter to be the  foreseeable result of the unquestioning support given by the  world arrogance and American imperialism to the policies of an  illegal and illegitimate regime, which is an agent of tension  and crisis in the region and the instigator of the suppression  and massacre of the Muslims and free minded individuals who wish  to live in their own homeland.    The cabinet of the Government of the Islamic Republic of  Iran, categorically supports the justice seeking struggles of  the Palestinian nation, and in sympathy with those people and  the families of the martyrs and injured in that horrific  disaster declare a general day of mourning throughout the  country on Saturday 7 Esfand [26th February].

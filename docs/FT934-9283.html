			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Arts: Han Ong's 'The LA Plays' - Theatre According to a programme note for the new play at the Almeida, there were 36 arrests of male prostitutes under the age of 18 in the city of Los Angeles last year. I have been wondering what that figure means. Is 36 a lot or a little? Should there have been more arrests, fewer or none at all? Is it the age figure that is significant? What happened after the arrests and, while we are on the subject, what are the numbers for female prostitutes, and the changes over time? On the basis of other figures in the programme, 36 seems rather small. The population of Los Angeles County grew by 50 per cent to just over 9 million between 1960 and 1990. There are 31,753 actors and directors living in LA, not including dancers, models, singers and game show hosts. Equity, the actors' union, has a membership of 9,000 in the Los Angeles area. The conclusions from the statistics are not clear. On the other hand, Han Ong has the good sense to keep the figures off the stage. The LA Plays are an effective piece of theatre at least until about two-thirds of the way through. They tail off when they enter into a bout of repetitive four letter words, but before that there is much to entertain and to instruct. The quality of the acting and the direction is uniformly high throughout. The difficulty, for the author as much as for the audience, is trying to determine what the piece is about. Three strands compete. One is what it is like to be an Asian-American; another is what happens if you are a male drug-pushing prostitute to boot; and the third is the special nature of Los Angeles in particular (the pursuit of stardom) and America in general - 'a big country', as one of the characters says, 'but a lonely place'. There is also Aids. All of which is a lot to put into a piece of 21 short scenes lasting barely two hours including an interval. To a European, not resident in Los Angeles, quite the most interesting aspect sociologically is the absence of blacks. Here are whites, Hispanics and Asians: no wonder the blacks in the city sometimes rebel. The Asian 18-year-old, beautifully played by Francois Chau, and oddly called Greg, is universally described as 'smart'. He is frequently asked by Caucasians about his ethnic origins - American Indian, Japanese, Chinese or what? (In fact, his family is from Taiwan.) All that he takes in his stride. He does not seem to have any doubt that American is what he has become, but he prefers to use his smartness on homosexual affairs, a bit of travel to New Mexico, while making enough money from peddling drugs and hiring himself out. He is rather a striking, attractive figure even when the inevitable Aids sets in. Other characters stand out less, though I greatly admired the performance of Ramon Tikaram as Greg's friend, Nicholas. Ong says his play is as much about geography as about people, and one can see what he means. A young white arrives in LA from Iowa, and seems more out of place than Greg from Taiwan: he, too, takes to male prostitution, but tends to call his clients 'sir'. For the most part, this is a haunting production with some very terse dialogue. It is directed by Matthew Lloyd and cleverly designed by Julian McGowan. Almeida Theatre. (071) 359 4404</p>

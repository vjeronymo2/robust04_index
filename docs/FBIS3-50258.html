			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Ion Cristoiu editorial: "A Scandal That Cannot Be Ignored"] </F>   [Text] The last issue of the weekly ROMANIA MARE devotes  almost a whole page to an article entitled: "The Establishment  and Functioning of an Organized Group, Under the Direction of  Certain Foreign Secret Services, That Penetrated High Official  Positions." Such a title is not surprising in the least for the  magazine headed by [Greater Romania Party President] Corneliu  Vadim Tudor. As one can see, the paper expresses the obsession  of Corneliu Vadim Tudor, Ilie Neacsu, and other native  nationalist-communists who see everywhere smaller or bigger  spies that have come to Romania from all parts of the world, by  ship or by plane, to be discovered and seized by our brave and  well-fed patriots. In this respect it is easy to notice that  the title strikingly reminds us of the reports devoted by the  SCINTEIA [official organ of the former Romanian Communist Party]  of the fifties to the trials of "certain saboteurs, spies, and  agents of English-U.S. imperialism."    Under this sign of the Stalinist spy-game that disappeared  in  the early days of the Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej [first Romanian  post-war leader] regime and reappeared and is flourishing in the  Iliescu regime, the ROMANIA MARE weekly accuses some of the  current state officials of being spies. The respective  officials are the following: Adrian Nastase, president of the  Chamber of Deputies and executive president of the ruling party  [Social Democracy Party of Romania]; Minister of State Dan  Mircea Popescu; Ioan Mircea Pascu, secretary of state at the  Ministry of National Defense; and Ioan Talpes, head of the SIE  [Foreign Intelligence Service]. Together with others, the  aforementioned persons are revealed as belonging to an organized  group that has infiltrated the structures of our country's  leadership in order to promote the policy and interests of  foreign powers. In the Romanian press that appeared after the  1989 December revolution, many stupid things were published on  the issue of certain public figures having been members of  various spy networks that were established in Romania.  Unfortunately, the so-called revelations have not appeared only  in the pages of the nationalist-communist press, but also in the  pages of the independent press. Therefore, without any proof,  the members of the leadership and of the opposition were accused  of being members of the CIA, KGB, and Mossad. At first glance,  the ROMANIA MARE article should be counted as another proof of  journalistic dilettantism, seriously influenced by the cheap  thrillers read by their authors. That is how, I believe, the  officials accused by ROMANIA MARE viewed the respective article,  because, although quite some time has passed since the  publication of that article, they still keep silent and pretend  that nothing has happened. I believe that this position of  ignoring things adopted by the respective personalities is  erroneous. The scandal has much greater proportions than what  the accused ones believe or allow to be believed. The  respective article was not published in just any publication,  but in the weekly whose owner and director is the leader of a  party that is part of the government coalition. Had the  accusation come from the opposition or independent press, there  would be no need to notice it. It has already become a nervous  tic of Corneliu Vadim Tudor to denounce the opposition and the  independent press as being full of English and U.S. spies.  However, the article is talking about members of the current  leadership. And this leadership makes a great fuss about the  issue of the fierce battle that it wages to defend the  independence and sovereignty of the country. Within this  context, the denunciation by the Greater Romania Party leader  (that is, the leader of a party that is a member of the  government coalition) of an espionage network that penetrated  the leadership, at such a high level of the government, Chamber  of Deputies, the Romanian Foreign Intelligence Service, and the  Army should provoke a rapid and firm stance by those who are  involved and the respective institutions that are in charge of  watching over national security. Needless to say that had a  foreign espionage network penetrated the structures of our  leadership, that would be one of the most serious attempts  against the sovereignty and independence of our country. The  stand of those public figures should make things clear to the  public. Either what Corneliu Vadim Todor published in the  ROMANIA MARE weekly is true, and in that case the accused  persons should not only be urgently removed from office but also  brought to justice, or the accusations included in the  respective article are completely erroneous, and in that case,  the Social Democracy Party of Romania and Ion Iliescu must  definitively break the alliance with Corneliu Vadim Tudor. The  act of launching false accusations against high officials of the  state proves the completely irresponsible attitude of the PRM  leader. And the presence of such an irresponsible person in the  structures of the country's leadership -- thanks to the alliance  with the PDSR and thanks to Ion Iliescu -- is just as serious an  attempt on the national security as the existence of an  espionage network that penetrated Romania's top leadership.</p>

			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / Peruvian business to issue Eurobonds A consumer goods and pharmaceuticals group plans to become the first Peruvian company for over a decade to make a Eurobond issue, marking a big step in the nation's financial rehabilitation. The Rodriguez Group hopes to raise Dollars 40m (Pounds 27.3m). It will part-finance the group's Dollars 67m acquisition two weeks ago of Cementos Yura, a formerly state-owned cement producer. Lead manager for the issue is VestcorpPartners Group, a Latin American investment bank with offices in Miami and London. VestcorpPartners is underwriting the issue and taking a 15 per cent stake in Cementos Yura. Peru has being largely marginalised from the international financial community for 25 years, with predominantly statist and protectionist democratic governments succeeding a long period of rule by left-wing military. But since the election of President Alberto Fujimori in 1990, it has mended its fences with international creditors. Arrears with multilateral organisations have been settled and it is following an IMF-monitored economic programme.</p>

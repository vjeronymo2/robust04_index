			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Viola Herms Drath: "Problems of Calculation"] </F>   [Text] Washington's foreign policy experts still disagree  on whether President Bill Clinton's balancing act in his policy  toward China and Korea, Bosnia, Haiti, the CIS, and the Middle  East -- to name just a few crisis spots -- is more a result of  promises made during the election campaign or of weak leadership  that has become more apparent through the Whitewater scandal.  The experts agree, however, that the Clinton Administration's  foreign policy, which has been criticized for its zigzag course,  does contain a pragmatic element of willingness to compromise.    However unsuccessful Secretary of State Warren Christopher's  Beijing talks that made human rights the precondition for  renewing the most-favored-nation clause may seem, there is  little doubt that Clinton's team will find a way out of the  dilemma. The positive signals by Secretary of Commerce Ronald  Brown and Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen indicate that Clinton  does not want to become a prisoner of his election campaign  promises.    In these calculations, the nuclear potential of North Korea,  which is still resisting inspections, still plays an important  role. In a Security Council debate on sanctions, China's veto  could still bring about a decision.    In view of the great number of Iranian "defense attaches"  discovered by the South Koreans in Pyongyang, nuclear  nonproliferation remains a crucial topic for the White House.    The Chinese are not the only ones encouraged to take a  tougher course by the noticeable power vacuum in Washington.  The Russians are claiming power in Bosnia and the Middle East.  The recent blocking of stricter sanctions against Iraq by  China, Russia, and France has shown that Security Council  decisions opposed to U.S. interests may face opposition as well.    Meanwhile, Washington is trying to get the disrupted  Israeli-Palestinian autonomy talks going again by a number of  security policy compromises and to keep the reins of this  complex peace process in hand by roping in Syria's Hafiz  al-Asad, Jordan's King Husayn, and Lebanon's president.    Clinton and his team concentrating on social reforms have  had  to learn that foreign-policy developments are hard to control.  The fact that debates on regional conflicts, which have often  been regarded as nuisance, are very well suited to diverting  attention from the Whitewater scandal is something that even  people from the depths of Arkansas have realized.    With "pragmatic partnership," Clinton's new defense  secretary, William J. Perry, is trying to find a basis for  America's Russia policy that is more acceptable to Congress  because it is geared to security policy, not so much on reform  assistance as it used to be. This policy might be consolidated  by Moscow's participation in the "Partnership for Peace."  Recently, Clinton was able to bask in the light of the Bosnian  Croat-Muslim confederation ceremony. What is also certain,  however, is that a U.S. President taking a pragmatic course  makes U.S. foreign policy difficult to assess for a world that  is waiting for someone to take the lead.</p>

			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / World Trade News: Europeans scramble for crumbs It is a familiar Brussels tale. European support for a Gatt world trade agreement will depend less upon grand political calculations but rather on behind-the-scenes deals aimed at appeasing aggrieved parties, of whom the most powerful remains France. As foreign ministers yesterday debated the merits of the US-European Union trade pact, now within an ace of completion, it became clear that at least four or five member states sought 'compensation'. Thus Portugal is looking for special aid to restructure its ailing textile industry; Greece wants compensation for potential losses to its maritime shipping industry; Spain is worried about Mediterranean fruit; and Ireland is concerned about its farmers. Paris is leading the pack, using all-or-nothing tactics. As a veteran EU diplomat put it, with both distaste and admiration: 'The French have realised they have squeezed as much as they can expect out of the Americans, now they are looking to do the same with their European partners.' Late on Monday night, Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, insisted that France was still unsatisfied on agriculture; industrial tariffs, particularly on textile imports to the US; films and broadcasting; and new global trade rules. First, Paris wants a guarantee from its EU partners that French farmers will not suffer any more loss of production under the revised EU-US Blair House accord than it has already agreed under the May 1992 reform of the Common Agricultural Policy. Second, France is pressing for tougher European trade weapons such as anti-dumping measures to match American measures. This would include a 'market opening' instrument similar to US Section 301 legislation. 'They want a nuclear balance,' said one German diplomat. By far the most serious problem centres on agriculture. France's demands put her at odds with her traditional ally, Germany. If French pressure translates into lower prices to compensate for Blair House curbs on production, this would allow its comparatively efficient cereal producers to capture market share in Germany at the expense of German farmers. French pressure for financial compensation is a potential EU budget-buster. Several diplomats doubted yesterday whether spare cash existed within the seven-year Delors II budget package, agreed last December at the Edinburgh summit, mainly because a 'weasel' provision allowing 'appropriate steps' to meet exchange rate turbulence had been exhausted. Germany is in a weak position. Traditionally a supporter of budget restraint, Bonn makes an exception with its farmers. Hence its insistence that the so-called 'switchover' mechanism to protect German farmers from D-Mark revaluations remains intact - a demand which has grown louder after the collapse of the ERM last August and the decision to float all currencies within a 15 per cent band. In better times, Chancellor Helmut Kohl would have slipped into his familiar role as the reluctant paymaster. But with a steep budget deficit and sliding popularity, Mr Kohl no longer has the same margin of manoeuvre. The assumption yesterday was that the internal wrangle would have to be resolved at the European summit on Friday. The billion Ecu question is whether Mr Kohl will cough up, once again, for his French ally.</p>

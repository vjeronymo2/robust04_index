			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 'WE WILL GET MARK DAVIS,' LAWYER FOR PADRES SAYS  </P> <P> Fred Lane, the Chicago-based attorney retained by Padre owner Joan Kroc to  handle negotiations with free-agent pitcher Mark Davis, said Wednesday that the  Padres will sign Davis.  </P> <P> But there has been no progress in Lane's negotiations with Alan Hendricks,  Davis' agent, and Wednesday Hendricks was more interested in the deals of other  players such as Minnesota's Kirby Puckett.  </P> <P> Lane also said he has been in touch with Arn Tellem, Mark Langston's agent, and  expects to be in a position to make an offer to Langston sometime next week.  </P> <P> As for Davis, Lane and Hendricks talked earlier this week, but Lane didn't make  an offer. Lane said he now figures to make one toward the end of next week.  </P> <P> "I think we're going to get Mark Davis . . . we will get Mark Davis," Lane  said. "We will get him, and it will be a fair arrangement for both of us."  </P> <P> Why?  </P> <P> "Because we want him, and he wants us," Lane said. "We'll work it out."  </P> <P> Said Hendricks: "I'm happy they feel that way. That's nice. Somebody is going  to get him. I'm not pulling for or against the San Diego Padres. But I have to  worry about what's best for Mark Davis and his family. If that's concurrent  with what's best for the San Diego Padres, I'd be happy."  </P> <P> Lane originally planned to make an offer to Hendricks Monday but didn't.  </P> <P> "I can only make a deal with people who are prepared to listen," he said. "They  need to do more shopping."  </P> <P> With every new player signing this winter, that shopping list becomes more  complicated for the Padres. Puckett, who wasn't eligible yet for free agency,  agreed to a three-year, $9-million contract Wednesday. The Yankees signed  free-agent pitcher Pascual Perez, 9-13 for Montreal last season, to a  three-year contract worth $5.7 million Tuesday. Friday, Kansas City signed  pitcher Bret Saberhagen, the American League Cy Young award winner, to a  three-year contract extension for $8.9 million.  </P> <P> "They (the Padres) can make their proposal any time they want," Hendricks said.  "They seem to want to wait until they see what the market is. Puckett and Perez  have signed in the last 24 hours, and Saberhagen, (Nick) Esasky and (Kevin)  Bass have all signed. That's what the market is to me."  </P> <P> Two free agents were signed last week: Atlanta signed Esasky, a first baseman,  to a deal reported to be worth $5.7 million over three years, and San Francisco  signed Bass, an outfielder, to a three-year package worth $5.25 million.  </P> <P> Saberhagen and Perez, both starting pitchers, are most relevant to Davis, the  National League Cy Young Award winner.  </P> <P> "I read last week where a reliever won't command as much money as a starter,  but that viewpoint isn't shared by very many clubs," Hendricks said. "As a  matter of fact, some clubs have told me that a reliever is worth more than a  starter because he's in more games and has more opportunities."  </P> <P> Davis is seeking a four-year contract for what sources have said is as much as  $10 million.  </P> <P> "The contract's length is important, and that has been well-chronicled,"  Hendricks said. "We've got to solve that. I'm of the opinion that Mark Davis is  as valuable as anybody on the free agent market."  </P> <P> A New York newspaper reported last week that the Yankees had made an offer for  Davis, but Hendricks wouldn't confirm that.  </P> <P> "I'm not going to say anything publicly that will help or hinder the process,"  Hendricks said. "All I will confirm is that we have a lot of interested teams,  and that shouldn't be shocking news to anybody. They know we have a stated  asking price, and whoever meets it will get him. Period."  </P> <P> Hendricks said he would like to have Davis signed by the end of the winter  meetings, which are Dec. 2-7 in Nashville, Tenn.  </P> <P> As for Langston, Lane said he and Tellem discussed terms Tuesday, but the  Padres will not make a formal offer until next week.  </P> <P> "Men who have top-flight pitchers seem to be checking the market out  thoroughly," Lane said.  </P></p>

			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norwegian oil find put at 440m barrels NORWAY HAS announced its biggest oil discovery in eight years, made in the remote northern region of the Norwegian Sea where relatively limited exploration has been undertaken. The find is likely to encourage industry interest in exploration in the region, particularly when awards for acreage in the country's 14th licensing round are announced later this year. Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, which made the discovery, believes it could be bigger than the find recently made by British Petroleum west of the Shetland Isles, which is estimated to contain 250m to 500m barrels of oil. 'We are very excited by the promise of the discovery and are working hard to enable the field to be developed. The discovery increases the faith we have in the future of the Norwegian continental shelf,' said Mr Johan Nic Vold, group executive vice-president. Statoil's preliminary estimate of the new oil reserves is 70m cubic metres, or 440m barrels. A third well is planned to be drilled in the north-western part of the structure where Statoil believes reserves could be boosted substantially. The field also contains about 10bn cu m of gas, which could be reinjected into the reservoir during the early stages of production. Ms Wenche Skorge, a Statoil spokeswoman, said because the discovery is situated in 400 metres of water, which is considered very deep by industry standards, an integrated floating production platform is likely to be one of the main solutions to be studied for the development of the as yet unnamed field. Statoil intends to lodge a plan for development of the field in 1994 and to bring it on stream in 1998. Industry analysts suggest development costs could be between NKr20bn and NKr25bn (Pounds 1.95bn and Pounds 2.45bn), depending on the chosen scheme. The field is about 85 km (53 miles) north-east of the NKr24bn Heidrun field, at present being developed by Conoco Norway to come on stream in the third quarter of 1995. Heidrun contains 750m barrels of oil. Ms Skorge said the new field could be the size of Heidrun, but at any rate it is the largest discovery on the Norwegian continental shelf since Heidrun was found in 1985. The Norwegian Petroleum Directorate's provisional reserves estimate of the field is 50m cu m, or about 315m barrels of oil, but Statoil says the NPD's estimate is far too conservative. The NPD says several wells will have to be drilled before reserves can be estimated with certainty. The partners in the field include Statoil, with a 50 per cent stake of which 25 per cent is the Norwegian state's direct interest; Norsk Hydro and Saga Petroleum, each with 15 per cent, and Norsk Agip and Enterprise Oil Norge each with 10 per cent.</p>

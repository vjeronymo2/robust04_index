			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / International Company News: Share issue to cut state stake in Valmet Valmet, the Finnish paper machinery and engineering group, yesterday announced plans for an international offering of up to 7m new shares. The move, which could raise around FM700m (Dollars 129.6m), continues the government's privatisation programme and would cut state ownership in the group from 73 to 61 per cent. The size of the issue and pricing will be finalised after an international roadshow later this month. If demand exceeds 7m shares, the state has agreed to sell 1m Valmet shares, reducing its holding further to 59 per cent. The shares have recently been trading at FM100. Valmet is one of the world's leading suppliers of paper machinery. Last year profits after financial items amounted to FM100m on sales of FM10.7bn. A further improvement is expected this year. Valmet's share capital will rise to FM851m from FM711m if the share offer is fully subscribed. Merrill Lynch International is global co-ordinator to the offering and Mandatum &amp; Co is domestic lead manager.</p>

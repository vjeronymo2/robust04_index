			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> OVERCROWDING IN COUNTY JAILS IS NOT AN EASILY RESOLVED ISSUE  </P> <P> During the last few days, I have read with interest your articles on inmate  overcrowding within the Orange County jail system.  </P> <P> The reporting correctly describes the dire need for additional jail facilities  to house the ever-increasing number of inmates.  </P> <P> I agree the need is real and expanded facilities must be built. However, what  is very disturbing to me is that your reporting serves to incite rather than  help resolve a critical urban problem in Orange County.  </P> <P> Everyone has to assume a responsibility based on facts and knowledge of the  problem and that includes the County Board of Supervisors, the media and the  residents of Orange County. We need the media's participation to give the  public the full and accurate scope of information on this issue. This is not  being done.  </P> <P> I take exception to the implied criticisms of the Board of Supervisors and,  contrary to the tone of the articles, this board does recognize the need for  additional jail beds and has worked aggressively to acquire them.  </P> <P> I believe your newspaper and its readers realize, however, that one cannot  simply say, "There's a big canyon; let's build a new jail in it." The issues  that surround acquisition, construction and operation are complex, and often  years of court challenges and public opposition must be overcome before a new  jail becomes a reality.  </P> <P> One of the biggest problems faced by the Board of Supervisors (and all state,  federal and local governments responsible for correctional facilities) is NIMBY  (the "Not In My Back Yard") syndrome. It seems that everybody in Orange County  recognizes the need but will support only jail facilities that are built far  away from where they may live or work. That's a pretty tall order for an urban  county.  </P> <P> By a majority vote, this board has designated a remote jail site at Gypsum  Canyon and has had preliminary facility designs already completed. However, as  soon as the environmental impact report was certified, its adequacy was  immediately challenged in court by local jurisdictions who wanted a jail  anywhere except their "back yard."  </P> <P> Other obstacles exist that add to the difficulties inherent in building new  jails. In Orange County, the enormous cost involved in first constructing and  then operating a new facility creates a grave financial burden that this board  is working diligently to overcome.  </P> <P> General obligation bonds can be issued (with voter approval) to finance the  acquisition and construction of jail facilities, but they cannot be used for  personnel and operating costs. With an estimated price tag of more than $100  million annually, ongoing operational costs will result in a significant  negative impact to the county's general fund.  </P> <P> I hope that your articles will work in a way that you had not expected -- that  is, to provide the beginning of a public consensus to get a new, larger jail  facility built and operating as quickly as possible. This can happen only if  the public is willing to put aside NIMBY and work toward a common goal.  </P> <P> HARRIETT M. WIEDER, Supervisor, Second District  </P></p>

			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Lawson scorns plan to beat boom-bust cycle Lord Lawson yesterday derided the government's plans to end the UK economic cycle of boom and bust, arguing that economies always move in cycles irrespective of attempts to abolish them. In a thinly veiled rebuke of Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, Lord Lawson said: 'The plain fact is that the economic cycle is endemic - which means that all the talk of no return to boom and bust is somewhat premature, to say the least.' Mr Clarke recently pledged that the government would not steer Britain's economic recovery into a new boom and bust cycle. However, Lord Lawson, in a lecture organised by the Social Market Foundation and the London School of Economics, said: 'I have no sympathy whatever for the more ambitious notion that the objective of macroeconomic policy should be to iron out the business cycle.' Lord Lawson, Britain's longest-serving postwar chancellor, until his resignation in 1989, said all attempts by governments to steer economies 'along an impossibly straight line' by macroeconomic policy had failed. His comments angered the Treasury, but it declined to comment publicly. However, in private senior officials suggested Lord Lawson was wrong to argue that 'the government could not and would not end the boom-and-bust cycle that had bedevilled past governments'. Lord Lawson went on to say that recent events demonstrated the power of financial markets to impose their will on national governments suspected of financial imprudence. Instead of focusing on the short-term vagaries of the business cycle, about which policymakers could do very little, he urged the government to concentrate on boosting long-term performance by improving the supply side of the economy. He suggested a significant extension of the UK family credit system to provide top-up payments to all those in work on very low pay, fitting in with a system of workfare  - making the payment of benefit conditional on community work. Lord Lawson also repeated his criticism of the government's determination not to grant independence to the Bank of England. 'The half-way house alighted upon by the present government, of publishing the minutes of the regular monetary meetings between the chancellor and the governor, is an interesting innovation,' he said. But when it came to raising interest rates, if the minutes represented an honest account, they could have a detrimental effect on the credibility of the authorities' decisions in the financial markets. That, he argued, would outweigh any advantage derived from the new arrangement.</p>

			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Asians upset over textiles - Change in US rules of import origin 'will disrupt trade' Asian textiles and clothing exporters and US retailers and garment importers are protesting at a proposed change in US rules of origin for textiles imports which, they say, could seriously disrupt international trade and investment. The proposal, which has received backing in Congress, would rewrite US customs rules by defining products' origin according to the country where they were 'assembled', instead of where they were cut. Hong Kong, one of the exporters which is most at risk, said yesterday that the change conflicted with US commitments under the Uruguay Round trade deal. It also challenged the recent agreement to phase out the Multi-Fibre Arrangements, which restrict world textiles trade. The Hong Kong government has joined the governments of Australia and of members of the Association of South East Asian Nations in writing to senior Clinton administration officials and congressional leaders to express their concern. They are lobbying in close co-op-eration with the US Association of Importers of Textiles and Apparel, whose members include jeans manufacturer Levi-Strauss, fashion house Liz Claiborne and The Limited, a leading retail chain. Ms Laura Jones, the association's executive director, condemned the proposal yesterday as a protectionist measure which would raise the cost of US textiles imports by several hundred million dollars a year. The proposal, strongly supported by US textiles and clothing makers, has been approved in principle by the House of Representatives' powerful ways and means committee as part of its draft Uruguay Round implementing legislation. The Senate finance committee is considering a similar amendment. Officially, the US administration has adopted a neutral stance towards these moves. However, critics say some senior officials have appeared to indicate support for the change. Though the detailed effects of the proposal are hard to predict, it could upset existing arrangements under which textiles produced in one country are shipped to another to be made into clothing and then exported as a product of the first country. Opponents fear that would require exporters abruptly to switch output between national quotas imposed under the MFA and could lead to higher tariffs on some US imports. Ms Jones of the US importers' association said the proposal would particularly affect Hong Kong, which sends large amounts of textiles to be processed in China, whose US textiles quota is already filled to capacity. Hong Kong said that as well as threatening existing commercial arrangements, the proposal called into question the basis of the agreement in the Uruguay Round to phase out the MFA. It also challenged pledges by Gatt members to refrain from new trade restrictions before the round took effect. Comitextil, a leading organisation of European clothing and textiles manufacturers, said the proposal could affect some of its members' exports to the US. However, the organisation was not protesting because the proposal would move US rules of origin closer to those used by the EU. Unlike the EU, the US at present uses different rules of origin for different types of products. The US Treasury is currently considering plans to standardise its rules, though it is unclear how this move would fit in with the proposals in Congress. Gatt members also agreed as part of the Uruguay Round to discuss ways of harmonising their definitions of rules of origin on a worldwide basis.</p>

			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: Intervention helps reduce borrowing requirement THE likely impact of UK government borrowing on prices in the gilt-edged market has changed sharply in the space of a fortnight. The borrowing requirement for 1992/93 has been greatly reduced, due to the level of intervention in the currency markets in the days before sterling was hauled out of the European exchange rate mechanism. Also, in the immediate future the Bank of England appears more likely to issue short-dated and index-linked stocks. So far this week, the bank has issued a total of Pounds 1.1bn in index-linked gilts responding to strong demand due to concern that inflation could rise. Estimates of how much the bank spent on intervention vary widely. Mr John Kendall, economist at Baring Sterling Bonds, estimates that more than Pounds 10bn spent on intervention will count towards this year's funding requirement. The bank's official reserves figures for September will be released on October 2, which should provide a more accurate indication of how much was spent on defending the pound. Intervening to support the currency helps the government's funding on the one hand, while running down its foreign currency reserves on the other. Mr Nigel Richardson, economist at Warburg Securities, calculates that about Pounds 5.5bn of borrowing remains to be done this financial year, assuming a public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) of Pounds 33bn - against the government's forecast of Pounds 28bn - and intervention amounting to about Pounds 10bn. The figure also takes into account the latest index-linked issues. Some analysts say that the funding for 1992/93 has already been completed. Even if the government has already hit its target, however, there is a strong possibility that the bank will continue to issue gilts in the current financial year - if market conditions are conducive - to fund some of next year's PSBR in advance. This is likely to be as big, if not larger, than that for 1992/93. Following sterling's exit from the ERM, the shape of the gilt yield curve has changed: yields on short-dated issues have fallen while those on long-dated stocks have risen with the result that the yield curve is no longer inverted. This has important implications for further gilt issuance, making it cheaper for the government to borrow at the short end of the yield curve. The sharp rise in yields on long-dated issues reflects concern about the prospects for inflation now that the UK no longer has the discipline of ERM membership to determine its economic policy. The reduced funding requirement should help to ease some of this pressure on yields. Inflation worries have prompted renewed demand for index-linked gilts, as investors see them as an effective means of obtaining a real return. On Monday, the bank sold Pounds 500m of its new index-linked stock - the 4 5/8 per cent gilt due 1998 - within a few hours, and yesterday Pounds 600m of the 4 3/8 per cent index-linked gilt due 2004 was issued to take advantage of the rally in the sector. Dealers report a surge in turnover in the index-linked sector over the last fortnight. So far this year, the bank has issued Pounds 2.4bn of index-linked stock in small tranches, compared with Pounds 15.5bn in conventional gilts (where most of the issuance has been in medium-dated and long-dated issues). The fact that the last two gilt issues have been index-linked suggests that the government is keen to demonstrate confidence in its ability to keep inflation down: however, it also indicates that the bank is issuing in those areas where demand is seen to be strongest.</p>

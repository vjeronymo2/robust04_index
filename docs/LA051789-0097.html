			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Afghanistan's Marxist government said that Muslim rebels have abandoned their  quest to capture the eastern city of Jalalabad and have opened a major  offensive against the southern border town of Khost. A Foreign Ministry  spokesman said at least 1,193 guerrillas have been killed since the Khost  attack began over the weekend. Afghan armed forces responded with heavy  artillery and air strikes to a frontal assault by 9,000 guerrillas and fired  dozens of Scud-B missiles from bases in Kabul, the capital, about 250 miles  north of Khost, he said.  </P></p>

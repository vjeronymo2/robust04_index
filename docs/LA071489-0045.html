			<p><P> July 14, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ONLY 1 OF 6 ALIENS TO BE CHARGED IN PARK STABBING  </P> <P> Criminal charges will not be filed against five of the six men arrested last  week in connection with the stabbing death of a man in Balboa Park, officials  said Thursday.  </P> <P> The sixth man, Javier Garcia Gutierrez, 19, will be arraigned today on one  count of murder and one count of robbery, said Linda Miller, a spokeswoman with  the San Diego district attorney's office.  </P> <P> "We didn't have the evidence on the other five," Miller said, explaining the  decision not to press charges. Miller declined to elaborate on the evidence  against Gutierrez.  </P> <P> She said she believes the investigation is still continuing. The police  investigators handling the case could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Gutierrez was being held without bail in the County Jail downtown, a jail  spokesman said. The other men have been turned over to the Immigration and  Naturalization Service, Miller said.  </P> <P> Gutierrez and the others identified themselves to police as Mexican nationals  who entered the United States illegally.  </P> <P> The group is believed to have been living in the canyons of Balboa Park, police  said. The men were taken into custody July 5 in connection with the death  earlier that day of Franklin James Black, 34, an unemployed and disabled San  Diego resident.  </P> <P> Black was found dead of multiple stab wounds after an apparent robbery attempt  near Balboa Drive and Maple Street, police said. He was wearing only athletic  shorts and shoes.  </P> <P> Officers found Black's wallet and the weapon believed used to kill him close to  where the men were apprehended.  </P> <P> Some of the men arrested had blood on their clothing at the time they were  taken into custody, police said.  </P> <P> Arrested last week besides Gutierrez, were Juan Sanchez Valenzuela, 18; Arnulfo  Garcia Gonzales, 21; Jamie Valdez Villareal, 22; Angel Munoz Espinosa, 18, and  Jose Lopez Montaina, 21.  </P></p>

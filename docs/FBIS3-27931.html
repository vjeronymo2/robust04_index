Touching on the question of Japan's sending personnel  to the former Yugoslavia to participate in UN Peacekeeping  Operations (PKO), Hata said: "From an official standpoint, the  overall situation has not met with the five principles on PKO  participation (such as a cease-fire accord) yet. We will have  to clarify this point." Thus, he indicated his view that the  current situation in the former Yugoslavia does not fulfill the  five principles.</p>

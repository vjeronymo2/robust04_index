			<p><P> August 3, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COURT REJECTS EFFORT TO ALTER BOUNDARY OF STATE COASTAL ZONE  </P> <P> A California Court of Appeal has rejected a legal challenge to the state  coastal zone boundary that, if successful, would have exempted a large area of  the Santa Monica Mountains from tough development controls.  </P> <P> In a 31-page ruling, the appellate court upheld the dismissal last year of a  lawsuit that sought to invalidate the coastal boundary on grounds that state  Coastal Commission staff drew it farther inland than lawmakers intended.  </P> <P> The ruling was cheered by a homeowners coalition that intervened in the  original lawsuit on the Coastal Commission's side.  </P> <P> "This is one of the most spectacular areas in this part of the state, and I'm  glad it won't be left to the tender mercies of Los Angeles County," David  Brown, vice president of the Las Virgenes Homeowners Federation, said after the  decision was handed down late last week.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Good News'  </P> <P> Chuck Damm, director of the commission's south coast district that includes Los  Angeles, Orange and San Diego counties, called the ruling "good news, because  our job is to protect . . . the resources within the coastal zone, and  specifically within the Santa Monica Mountains."  </P> <P> Sherman Stacey, lawyer for one of the landowners who brought the challenge,  maintained that lawmakers never meant to "take properties in for coastal zone  regulation" that are as far from the coast as those of his client. Stacey said  no decision has been made on whether to appeal to the state Supreme Court.  </P> <P> Coastal zoning places more restrictions than local zoning on development,  limiting grading, visual impact and disturbance of vegetation and wildlife  habitat. The boundary realignment sought by the lawsuit would have removed  hundreds of parcels and thousands of acres of land in the Santa Monicas from  the coastal zone.  </P> <P> At issue was language in the 1976 Coastal Act defining the coastal zone as  "that land and water area" on Coastal Commission maps, and went on to describe  how the maps should be drawn. In environmentally sensitive areas such as the  Santa Monicas, the zone was to extend inland "to the first major ridgeline  parallel to the sea, or five miles from the mean high tide line of the sea,  whichever is less."  </P> <P> In the process, the suit maintained, the staff hoodwinked lawmakers who did not  review final versions of the maps before approving the Coastal Act.  </P> <P> In defending the current boundary, the commission maintained that the "first  major ridge" should be defined as the ridge that creates a watershed -- not  merely the first topographic uplift inland from the coast, as the suit  maintained.  </P> <P> The ruling by the 2nd District Court of Appeal, dated July 26, upheld last  year's decision by Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Miriam Vogel, who rejected  the challenge.  </P> <P> "The plain language of the statute does not support the contention the  topographic standard is superior to the maps," the appellate court said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Suit Filed in 1987  </P> <P> Moreover, the court noted, legislation twice was introduced to change the maps,  but lawmakers did not see fit to pass it.  </P> <P> "This history shows the Legislature twice has had the opportunity to set the  coastal zone boundary at the first topographic elevation, but has chosen to  leave it as placed in the map," the court said. "It is reasonable to infer the  Legislature based its failure to modify the boundary, at least in part, on the  commission's view that the watershed is the critical ridgeline, not the first  topographic elevation."  </P> <P> The lawsuit was filed in 1987 by Rossco Holdings Inc. and Michel T. Ghosn, who  own three properties in Calabasas near Malibu Creek State Park that are three  to five miles from the beach. The Coastal Commission has approved housing  developments on all three tracts but has allowed fewer lots than the owners  sought and imposed other restrictions.  </P> <P> Rossco, owned by Beverly Hills attorney-businessman Leonard M. Ross, has  approval for 22 lots on its 102-acre Piuma tract on Piuma Road and was allowed  up to 34 lots on its 272-acre Quaker tract on Mulholland Highway in the Las  Virgenes Valley. The commission approved 23 house lots on Ghosn's 160-acre  tract. None of the tracts have been developed.  </P></p>

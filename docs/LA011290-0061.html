			<p><P> January 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES : LA CIENEGA AREA  </P> <P> In Roy Dowell's latest paintings billboards have as much to do with figuring  out the meaning of life as fine art ever could. He makes that blatantly clear  by layering pieces of greatly enlarged commercial color separations into chunks  of Cubist space and plugging in other pieces of a painterly vocabulary like  various appliances on a power strip.  </P> <P> Compositions that resemble game boards take on some significance with titles  like "Truth or Consequences." Visually, however, there is just enough  information to be vague. Oddly enough the painting's insistence on meaning  eventually wins and understanding quickly becomes its own perceptual game --  one where reason and order come through as random assignments. That's a lot to  get out of disparate patterns, spliced together into a dense arrangement of  razor sharp, geometric shapes. Yet perhaps clued to the modern, megabyte mind  set, they work. Together the paintings form a loose contemporary text on  abstraction that, with typical pluralist acceptance, directs thought to a  myriad of possible conclusions -- any and all of which are right.

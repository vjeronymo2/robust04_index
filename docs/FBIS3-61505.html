Karapetyan, A.A. </F> Galoyan, Biochemistry Institute at Armenian Republic's Academy  of Sciences, Yerevan; UDC 575.1]    [Abstract] The genus specificity of the human  adrenocorticotropic hormone (AKTG)--a peptide consisting of 39  amino acids which is produced and secreted in the hypophysis and  which stimulates biosynthesis of secretion of corticosteroids in  the adrenal cortex--and the desire to avoid unnecessary immune  reactions as well as the expense and tediousness of chemical  synthesis of the human adrenocorticotropic hormone prompted a  study of the expression of the human adrenocorticotropic hormone  in the form of a hybrid with S. aureus protein A.  This hybrid protein can be easily isolated from  Escherichia coli proteins. This system was used to  obtain the insulin-like growth factor IFH-I and to produce the  bovine adrenocorticotropic hormone. The plasmids containing most  of the S. aureus protein A gene as well as the  plasmids containing the bovine adrenocorticotropic hormone pUC  19/1, pUC 19/7, and pUC 19/Pro were used to construct  recombinant plasmids. The experiment procedure is outlined. The  hybrid gene sequence constructed as a result contains the  sequences which encode protein A of S. aureus and  human adrenocorticotropic hormone located in the same reading  frame. Synthetic adapter sequences whose specific cleaving will  eventually make it possible to isolate the end product from the  fused protein are built in between these sequences. The fused  protein synthesis detection procedure is described and the  possibility of protein A secretion by E. coli cell  derivatives is established. The conclusion is drawn that the  constructed plasmids direct the human adrenocorticotropic  hormone-containing fused protein synthesis in E.  coli. The authors are grateful to A.A. Shulga for help with  mutagenesis. Figures 1; references 9: 4 Russian, 5 Western.</p>

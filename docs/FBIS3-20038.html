In a communique issued after an EU foreign ministers'  meeting  failed to agree on changes to voting procedures after four new  member states are admitted to the Union, Andreatta said "I  believe that at the basis of the solution there must be a  compromise between those members which, like Italy, wish to see  a gradual political and economic integration between member  countries and, on the other hand, an acceptance of some nations'  concern to not allow the isolation of a minority which  represents a significant part of Europe's citizens."    EU foreign ministers will gather in northern Greece this  weekend for further talks on the voting procedure, which is  holding up entry to the Union for Austria, Sweden, Norway and  Finland.    With the four new members, who now seem unlikely to enter  the  Union on January 1, 1995 as planned, the number of votes in the  council of ministers would rise from 76 to 90. Some nations,  including Spain, want the blocking minority to rise from its  current 23 votes to 27 votes, to reflect this increase.    The Europarliament, which would have to ratify the new  memberships before they go to referendums in the countries  involved, has already said that it will not accept a blocking  vote of less than 27. The Parliament will be dissolved shortly,  to allow for elections in June.</p>

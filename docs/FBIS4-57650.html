			<p>BFN     [Text] The government has extended the state of emergency  until 19 July in the Paruro, Acomayo, Chumbivilcas, Canas, and  Canchis Provinces, Cusco Department. Houses may be searched  without a warrant and restrictions are imposed on peoples' right  to move freely from one place to another and to assemble  peacefully. Arrests cannot be made without a warrant issued by a  court or by the police unless a criminal is caught red-handed.    The supreme decree, published in EL PERUANO, states that the  state of exception seeks to expedite antiterrorist operations in  that region.</p>

			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / International Company News: Unitas pulls out of Skopbank talks UNITAS, the Finnish holding company of the Union Bank of Finland, has abandoned negotiations to buy Skopbank from the government's bank guarantee fund. The news leaves Skopbank's fate looking increasingly uncertain. Unitas was the last of those which had shown in interest in buying the bank still to be in discussions. The move also surprised banking analysts, who had believed the talks were going well as recently as last week. Unitas declined to say why the talks had broken down. The banking group had hoped that the proposed purchase would eventually lead to a broader collaboration with some of Finland's savings banks, as Skopbank is the central bank in the savings bank system. Skopbank, which was the country's fourth-largest bank, had to be rescued by the Bank of Finland in September 1991 to prevent it collapsing. In June, the Bank of Finland sold its holding in Skopbank to the government guarantee fund.</p>

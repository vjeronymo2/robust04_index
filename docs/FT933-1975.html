			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Technical trading pushes cocoa still higher LONDON COCOA prices yesterday built on last week's strong rise, as buyers pushed the December futures contract to a peak of Pounds 922 a tonne. The spur came from last week's push through the psychological barrier of Pounds 900 and the market yesterday was dominated by investment fund buying and technical trading, with no fresh news and cross trades accounting for more than 7,000 lots out of a total of just over 16,000. The second position eased back on profit-taking to close at Pounds 917, still up Pounds 14 on the day. The market's recent sharp rise to levels last seen in the summer of 1990 began in mid-August, fuelled by expectations that the next harvest, which starts in October, will bring a shortfall in world supply compared with demand for the third year running. The rally is attracting buying from financial institutions not usually interested in commodities, according to traders. With interest rates low and profits from traditional areas of activity being squeezed, more fund managers are turning to commodities that still appear relatively cheap, they say. The weekend agreement by producers and consumers on an orderly disposal of the International Cocoa Organisation's 230,000-tonne buffer stock has also removed a source of uncertainty hanging over the market, analysts said. The meeting, which ended late on Saturday, agreed the stock would be released on to the market over a maximum of four and a half years, starting in 1993-94. The disposal will take place at a rate of 51,000 tonnes a year, in equal monthly instalments, unless the ICCO council revises that amount at the end of the first year. The buffer stock was built up under the 1980 and 1986 International Cocoa Agreements as a way to stabilise the market. But its future has been unclear since it was frozen after market support operations collapsed in 1988. The gradual rundown of the stock will enable producer countries in arrears to pay off their debts. The start of the new cocoa pact, due at the end of this month when the 1986 agreement expires, has meanwhile been postponed until the end of February because most countries have not yet passed legislation enabling them to sign and ratify it, said an ICCO official. 'We still hope to bring the new agreement into force before that, if we get sufficient signatures,' she said. The last agreement covered 18 producing and 22 consuming countries. The new pact must have membership of at least five exporting countries, representing 80 per cent of exports, and consuming countries accounting for 60 per cent of imports. So far only the Ivory Coast, which produces just under 35 per cent of the world's cocoa, and Ecuador, producing 4.5 per cent, have signed.</p>

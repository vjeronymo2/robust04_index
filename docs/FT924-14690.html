			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Money Markets: Rate cut hopes build A STRONGER performance by sterling and hopes of a cut in German interest rates caused rates to ease on the UK money market yesterday, writes Neil Buckley. Actions by the Bundesbank put further downward pressure on German money market rates. German call money closed down at 8.90 per cent from a recent 9 per cent. With the Bundesbank injecting a net DM2.8bn into the German banking system - more than expected - via a 14-day securities repurchase pact, one dealer said it was 'actively pushing rates down'. 'It could be heralding a German rate cut,' he added. With sterling building on Tuesday's rally against the D-mark, there was renewed optimism in the UK market that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, might be able to reduce UK base rates. 'Hopes of a rate cut will not disappear from the market now unless sterling really does come down very sharply,' one London dealer said. Traders were also encouraged by reports that Mr Lamont was preparing to make a statement on the government's new economic policy at the Conservative party's conference in Brighton today. The key three month interbank rate - the best indicator of the future direction of interest rates - fell to 8 15/16 per cent from a previous close of 9 1/8 per cent, showing dealers' confidence that a base rate cut is in the offing before the end of the year. One-month money also eased to 9 3/16 per cent from 9 5/16 per cent. The December short sterling contract closed up three basis points at 91.85, although it had earlier touched a high of 91.90. Dealers said, however, they would expect the contract to be considerably above 92.00 if a rate cut was thought to be imminent. There were few problems with day-to-day funding. The Bank of England initially forecast a shortage of Pounds 800m, but this was twice revised, to reach Pounds 1bn. An early round of help injected Pounds 630m into the system, in the form of bills for resale to the market on November 2 at 8 15/16 per cent. Later purchases totalling Pounds 352m of band 1 bank bills at 8 7/8 per cent took the daily total to Pounds 982m - only Pounds 18m below the target. Overnight rates fell as low as 8 per cent but firmed to 9 per cent at the close.</p>

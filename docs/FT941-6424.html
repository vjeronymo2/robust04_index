			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Argentina wins loan of Dollars 509m The World Bank board yesterday approved a loan of Dollars 508.5m (Pounds 348.2m) for an innovative project to develop Argentina's capital markets. The Washington-based development institution agreed to lend Dollars 500m for a 'backstop' facility that will guarantee Argentina's commercial banks a source of liquidity if interest rates rise in the future, and will thus encourage them to lend money for longer periods to small and medium-sized businesses. The backstop fund will be owned by the Argentine government and managed by an internationally recognised financial institution. It will undertake to buy bonds from the commercial banks if interest rates rise beyond a fixed level, to allow them to refinance loans made for periods longer than six years. The hope is that the facility will help strengthen the balance sheets of the top 15 or 20 Argentine banks if interest rates turn upwards. Argentina is one of the World Bank's biggest borrowers, with loans totalling Dollars 3.6bn since the current government took office in 1989.</p>

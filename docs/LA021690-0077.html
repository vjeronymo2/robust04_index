			<p><P> February 16, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> UNSTABLE CLIFFS MAY KEEP HIGHWAY CLOSED;  </P> <P> LANDSLIDE: A COASTAL COMMISSION GEOLOGIST MAY DECIDE THAT EXCAVATING FARTHER  BACK INTO THE BLUFFS IS NECESSARY FOR A SAFER SLOPE.  </P> <P> Crumbling bluffs over El Camino Real, where an endangered plant species was  removed to a safer location last weekend, might cause the highway to be closed  for months rather than weeks, officials said Monday.  </P> <P> Although emergency repairs may be finished in two to three weeks, a state  Coastal Commission geologist will decide Friday whether more permanent work is  needed, officials said.  </P> <P> "With the danger of falling rock from the excavation," City Engineer William  Cameron said, "we would have to keep the whole road closed."  </P> <P> The highway from Avenida Pico to Camino Capistrano was shut down a week ago  when city workers clearing a small landslide after last week's rains noticed  deep chasms, some as wide as six feet, cutting into the 50-foot cliffs.  </P> <P> Although city officials originally predicted that El Camino Real would be  reopened in a few days, geologists determined over the weekend that simply  pulling down the precariously balanced sheets of rock and earth would be a  "Band-Aid" solution.  </P> <P> "It's a two-phase project," said Bill Brasher, project manager for the Lusk  Co., a development firm which owns the 250-acre site beside the highway.  Repairing the immediate danger would make the cliffs safe for up to three  years, he said.  </P> <P> But geologists hired by the city and the Lusk Co. agree that a second phase of  repair is needed, Brasher said. That repair would consist of contractors  excavating farther back into the cliffs to provide a safer, less severe slope.  </P> <P> Although he declined to estimate how long a second phase would take, the Lusk  spokesman said it would be longer than the two to three weeks predicted for  emergency repairs.  </P> <P> Any extensive cutting into the cliff face would require the permission of the  Coastal Commission. A geologist from the state agency will inspect the  ridgeline on Friday, Brasher said.  </P> <P> "He will be the key to how we can go with this," Brasher added.  </P> <P> The Lusk Co. overcame another potential delay last weekend when it arranged to  transplant from the cliffs a plant which is on the state's endangered species  list.  </P> <P> Known as Dudleya blochmanae, the tiny succulent grows only on cliff tops, where  it remains buried and dormant until a steady rain, said Mike Evans, co-owner of  the Tree of Life nursery in San Juan Capistrano.  </P> <P> About 18 flats containing thousands of the small green plants were transported  to the nursery on Saturday, Brasher said.  </P> <P> Resembling a miniature ice plant, the succulent was a subject of controversy  during discussions over failed plans to build a Richard M. Nixon library on the  250-acre site.  </P> <P> San Clemente has suffered from a series of landslides over the past 16 years,  including a rock fall in 1979 which closed a section of Coast Highway for  several months.

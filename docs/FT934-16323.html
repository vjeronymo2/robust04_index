			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Bermuda keeps faith with UBP BERMUDA'S ruling party was re-elected on Tuesday night with a majority of just four seats, retaining the grip on power it has enjoyed since the British dependent territory became self-governing in 1968. The United Bermuda party won 22 of the 40 seats in the island's House of Assembly, against 23 seats in the last election in 1989. The Progressive Labour party took all the remainder, with an independent incumbent and the only member of the country's National Liberal party losing their seats. The UBP's share of the vote remained unchanged at 50 per cent, but two of its cabinet ministers lost their seats; Sir John Sharpe, minister of delegated affairs and a former premier, and Mr Gerald Simons, the environment minister. The election was fought against a backdrop of anxiety that a PLP victory would threaten the island's future as an offshore centre. The opposition had pledged accelerated 'Bermudianisation,' but said it would do nothing to harm international business. Local issues dominated the campaign, particularly the future of the US Navy's air base on the island, which Washington has threatened to close as part of its defence cuts. Sir John Swan, the premier, said yesterday that with his new mandate he was re-opening talks with the US and would also be holding discussions with European Community and Canadian officials. The PLP, which draws its support predominantly from Bermuda's majority black population and blue-collar voters, saw its share of the vote rise from 37 per cent to 46 per cent in spite of a UBP campaign which questioned the opposition's ability to govern. Mr Frederick Wade, leader of the PLP, said: 'We accept the result. Bermuda has spoken. We intend to be on the case.' In spite of heavy rain during much of the day, voter turnout rose to 78 per cent, up from 74 per cent in 1989.</p>

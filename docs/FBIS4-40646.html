			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Belarusian Deputy Defense Minister Aleksandr </F> Tushinskiy by Captain A. Lebedev; place and date not given:  "Conversion Needs a Strong Legal Base"]    [Excerpts] [Lebedev] Since the definition of conversion by  some media is pretty vague, could you specify the meaning of  this word? What are the goals of conversion and since when has  it been under way?    [Tushinskiy] Speaking about conversion, it is very important  that we distinguish between changing the profile of defense  industry enterprises and exploiting their capacity -- as a  result of trimming the Belarusian Armed Forces potential -- for  civilian needs. Both are otherwise connected with the Army.    Of course, the goals of these two directions of conversion  are different. Conversion in the defense industry enterprises  is designed to reduce military production and reorient their  capacity and employees, which were left without any work, toward  civilian production. On the other hand, conversion of military  potential is aimed at consistently engaging the Army's part of  scientific and human potential, available as a result of  military scale-downs, in the social sphere of industry.    Both directions began in 1991 and are proceeding in several  stages. This year marks the beginning of a transitional period.  Today, the scientific and technical support of conversion is on  the agenda.    [Lebedev] Do those conversion programs have specific  managers?    [Tushinskiy] We established conversion departments at the  State Industrial Committee and the Ministry of Economy, as well  as the Department of International Security and Disarmament at  the Foreign Ministry. Their role is limited to providing expert  judgment concerning proposed programs. Legally, all  enterprises, including those working for the military, are  independent; so they bear single-handed responsibility for  conversion, as well. Our ministry has the Conversion of  Military Facilities Department.    Technically, the "pie" of responsibility for conversion  seems  to be carved up. However, the industry covered by conversion is  very important as it is closely linked with national security.  This is why this industry has no place for the provincial  mindset. Conversion must be managed by a single center which  would coordinate efforts of all links of the conversion chain,  including the Defense Ministry and enterprises. For this  purpose, we have already sent the Cabinet of Ministers a  proposal to set up the State Commission for Conversion and  Military Industrial Questions that could become such a center.  [passage omitted]    [Lebedev] Conversion of defense industry enterprises reduces  military orders. The intention is clear: One is supposed to  live by his means and spend money wisely. I am wondering,  however, where are the limits beyond which a drop in production  is inadmissible? After all, we are putting at risk our national  defense potential.    [Tushinskiy] Of course, one should not live beyond his  means.  However, the fact is that more than half the industrial capacity  of developed countries is dedicated to the defense of their  states, compared with only 4 percent in Belarus. Unfortunately,  we have long overstepped those limits.    There are many reasons for this. The reduction of military  orders was caused by the collapse on the domestic market of  Russia's Defense Exports Committee, with which we cooperated.  However, we must not let conversion devour something that we  will need tomorrow to maintain our combat readiness -- our high  technology and the expertise of our professionals. The military  industry needs orders. To get them, our state should make bolder  efforts to enter those foreign markets where our technology is  more advanced.    However, some of our politicians do not think about it. The  most important thing for them is to play their political card  and make a career. Take, for example, Deputy Lukashenko, who  said that by trading in arms Belarus discredits itself as a  neutral country. He is doing a great disservice to his country  and its combat readiness. I do not know about his professional  skills, but he does not seem to understand the principles of a  market economy and conditions that are vital for our combat  readiness. If anyone, a deputy must understand this. [passage  omitted]    [Lebedev] As we know, the Belarusian conversion plan is  carried out with the help of U.S. investments as part of the  U.S. Nunn-Lugar act. Can you say a few words about its goals  and advantages?    [Tushinskiy] In the opinion of U.S. Defense Secretary  William Perry, the financing of our conversion plans removes the  nuclear threat to the United States on the part of Belarus. The  Americans have earmarked $20 million for this purpose. However,  this aid does not come in the form of money. They directly put  their investments into the reequipment of our enterprises and  retraining of our personnel. The joint conversion plans  primarily cover Minsk defense giants, such as "Integral," the  "Computing Equipment" Science and Production Amalgamation, and  BelOMO. This promotes the integration of Belarusian enterprises  into the world market. So it is to each side's advantage. This  year, Belarus will receive a total of $100 million.    [Lebedev] America called upon its allies to join the  Belarusian conversion program. Did it receive any response?    [Tushinskiy] Yes, as of today, we have received a response  from Japan. Our governments signed an agreement securing $5  million for Belarus to conduct a number of measures preventing  the proliferation of nuclear weapons, including the installment  of ecologically safe storage conditions for radioactive  substances.    [Lebedev] Defense enterprises in all countries are closed to  unasked eyes, especially foreign. In Belarus, foreign  specialists were invited to work at these kind of facilities.  Do we not fear for our super-advanced technologies?    [Tushinskiy] Let me disagree with you on only one thing.  Western defense enterprises are open, even to foreign eyes. I  myself had the chance to visit a couple of them as a member of  military delegations. The production process at such sites is  exactly the same as at civilian enterprises. The time of  "underground plants" is long past.    Presently, enterprises protect only the most advanced  technologies, which you cannot see with a trained eye.  Generally speaking, so-called intellectual property should be  protected by law. Belarus has not yet developed such a law. So,  we will guard our national "know-how" with a package of  administrative measures.    [Lebedev] The collapse of the Soviet Union introduced  substantial corrections into the material and technical support  of the Belarusian Armed Forces. But we still need weapons,  equipment, ammunition, and production. Do the national  conversion programs take this into account?    [Tushinskiy] By all means. For example, the Minsk  Automobile Plant is finishing development work on two models of  transportation vehicles for our Armed Forces.    [Lebedev] Has the conversion of Belarusian defense  enterprises and the military potential of the Belarusian Armed  Forces produced any specific results?    [Tushinskiy] I think it would be more correct for me to  simply point to a number of enterprises which have successfully  changed their profiles. These are first of all our leaders,  BelOMO and "Integral." The Homel Radio Equipment Plant has also  succeeded in this. What should be noted about this plant is  that until recently, it turned out 90 percent of all military  production. Now, it manufactures the same amount of civilian  products.    As part of the conversion process, the Lida Optics Plant now  manufactures glass lenses instead of optical equipment for space.    The U.S.-Belarusian "Belkonvers" joint venture can also be  called a fruit of conversion. Based on U.S. technology, it  recycles conventional ammunition. Also deserving of attention  is the experience of the "Transaviaeksport" company, which  employs IL-76 transportation aircraft to train military crews  and fill commercial transportation orders serving the Republic's  interests.

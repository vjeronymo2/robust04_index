			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Hong Kong issues fall sharply The London market's heavily traded Hong Kong orientated stocks were given the roughest of rides in a generally uncomfortable equity market yesterday as dealers responded to the 2.5 per cent slide in Hong Kong share prices. Worst affected of the front line stocks was HSBC Holdings, which followed Monday's gradual post-results deterioration in its share price in London with a substantial retreat. Marketmakers said there was little support for HSBC shares throughout the day, with the stock price dropping to a low for the session of 868p at the close to leave a fall of 77p, or 8.1 per cent, after turnover of 6.4m shares. The Hong Kong-registered stock settled 80 off at 892p. NatWest Securities was one broking house to emphasise worries about quality of earnings at the bank which it said could hold the shares back in the short term. Upgrading its current-year numbers, NatWest said it expected a declining bad debts charge because of recovering economies in the UK and US, scope for growth in net income, and a high level of asset disposal profits. For 1994, the broker lifted its forecast from Pounds 2.7bn to Pounds 2.8bn, and for 1995 to Pounds 3.07bn. It also forecast a 13 per cent increase in the 1994 dividend to 26.5p and is looking for a dividend total of 29p for 1995. The fallout from HSBC impacted on other Hong Kong and Pacific Rim stocks such as Standard Chartered and Cable and Wireless. The former plunged 56, or 4.6 per cent, to 1159p in turnover of 928,000 shares, with one of the London market's biggest securities houses said to have tried to unwind a big long position in the stock just before the close of trading. C&amp;W, the telecoms group, held up well compared with HSBC and Standard, finishing only 13 down at 460p on turnover of 5.4m shares.</p>

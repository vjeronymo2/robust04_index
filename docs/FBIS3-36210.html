Permission was issued  by the Fishing Industry's Sakhalin Oblast Department on approval  from the Russian Federation Committee on Fishing in connection  with a shortage of funds to provide the islands with fuel oil,  gasoline, and diesel oil. According to Aleksandr Medvedev, head  of the Sakhalin administration fishing department, the Kurils  thus will be able to get from Japan and South Korea 45,000  tonnes of diesel fuel and 15,000 tonnes of fuel oil, quite  sufficient to solve these islands' energy supply problem.</p>

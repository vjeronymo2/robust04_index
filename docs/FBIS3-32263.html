			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for November 1993  rose by 1 percent, more than the 0.7 percent recorded for the  previous month.    The categories that make up the CPI basket are shown in the  following table, [table not reproduced] where it is clear that  the greatest increases occurred in health care (2.5 percent),  clothing (2.2 percent), education, reading, and entertainment  (1.7 percent), personal care (1.3 percent), and transportation  (1.1 percent).    Given the different weights attributed to each category,  however, it can be seen in the contribution column that the  categories of food, clothing, housing and home upkeep, health  care, and education, reading, and entertainment were the ones  that exerted the greatest influence on the growth of the CPI  this month, with figures of 0.4, 0.2, 0.1, and 0.1, respectively  [as published]. They account for 90 percent of the total  variation.    The sum of the contributions by category is not necessarily  equal to the total, because they are approximations.    The goods and services that had the greatest impact on the  variation in the CPI are listed below: [list not reproduced]    The products and services named in the above chart represent  a net contribution of 0.5, and together they account for 50  percent of the total variation in the CPI.    Marginal inflation (November 1992-November 1993) amounted to  13.4 percent, higher than the 5.8 percent reported for the same  period of the previous year.    The average index for January-November of this year rose by  10.5 percent, higher than the figure for the same period of last  year, 9 percent.    Cumulative inflation for December 1992 through November 1993  was 12.3 percent, a greater percentage than that recorded for  the previous period, 5.5 percent.    The average variation in the last 12 months (December  1992-November 1993) was 10.2 percent, compared to 9.9 percent  during the previous period.</p>

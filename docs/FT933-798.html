			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Sharon hits at Netanyahu MR ARIEL SHARON, the former Israeli defence minister, attacked Mr Benjamin Netanyahu, leader of the opposition Likud party, in a series of interviews at the weekend for failing to consult party colleagues before coming out so steadfastly against the Palestinian peace accord. Mr Sharon, by no means a supporter of the deal, says the Likud ought to have agreed to some alternative proposals to try to amend 'the most dangerous aspects of the deal' rather than to have flatly opposed an agreement that plainly cannot be stopped. Mr Netanyahu's energetic cross-country campaigning and his mastery of the television sound-bite helped him to a landslide victory in winning the Likud leadership last spring. Now, though, critics are hitting back. Three Likud Knesset members abstained in last Thursday's vote on Israel's autonomy deal with the PLO, helping Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister, to an easier than expected 61-50 victory, and Mr Sharon is among several Likud figures who are blaming Mr Netanyahu. Protests from other party figures concern issues of policy. Mr Netanyahu has steered the Likud further right, says Mr Meir Shetreet, to ground occupied by extremist parties which oppose all peace dealings with the Arabs. Internal Likud divisions look set to deepen in the next few days, with Mr Netanyahu's supporters pressing to expel Mr Shetreet and the two other abstainers.</p>

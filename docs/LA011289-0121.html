			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMNESTY SEEKERS RELIEVED TO FIND TEST EASIER THAN EXPECTED  </P> <P> Blanca Quintero has lived nervously in this country for 15 years.  </P> <P> Afraid that she was "not smart enough" to become a legal resident, the Mexican  native avoided the government for years and lived quietly and anonymously with  her two children.  </P> <P> Quintero, who has worked as a housekeeper for five years for John Gavin, former  U.S. ambassador to Mexico, said, "I was afraid to go out because I thought the  police were going to get me and send me back to Mexico."  </P> <P> But Wednesday, Quintero said she was "set free" -- and it was much easier than  she expected.  </P> <P> She was one of 15 amnesty applicants to earn permanent residency by passing a  15-question exam, administered by the Immigration and Naturalization Service at  its Wilshire Boulevard office for phase two of its amnesty program.  </P> <P> More than 800,000 immigrants applied for amnesty in the Los Angeles area under  the first phase of the program from May, 1987, to May, 1988. In the second  phase, these applicants must demonstrate a knowledge of English, civics and  U.S. history in order to obtain permanent residency status.  </P> <P> INS officials said they expect 300,000 of the applicants to follow Quintero's  lead by taking the multiple-choice exam at one of the 16 INS offices throughout  the area.  </P> <P> Others may choose to prove their English proficiency by taking INS-approved  classes at one of 300 schools in the area and thus would not have to take the  test. Applicants younger than 16, or 65 years and older, are exempt, officials  said.  </P> <P> Harold Ezell, INS Western regional commissioner, said his staff is negotiating  with religious and community groups in hopes that they will become licensed to  administer the test.  </P> <P> "It is going to be tough to find enough space for everyone to take the test, so  we are hoping to get Catholic charities, local schools and other groups  involved to help out," Ezell said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Appointment Needed  </P> <P> To take the test, immigrants must fill out an appointment card, available at  all INS offices, and the agency will notify applicants of the time and date of  their exam through the mail. Applicants have 18 months from the time of earning  their temporary residency card to complete the second phase of the program.  </P> <P> The test, to be given on Thursday nights starting Jan. 19, will be administered  by videotape to groups of immigrants. Applicants must sign a statement at the  top of the test that says they have studied at least 40 hours of English and  U.S. history, and then they have to answer nine of the 15 questions correctly  to pass.  </P> <P> "If they fail the test the first time, they can take it as many times as they  need to pass, free of charge," Ezell said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Most Pass It  </P> <P> But if the applicants who took the test Wednesday are any indication, passing  is not going to be a problem. Fifteen of the 16 test takers passed -- five with  perfect scores.  </P> <P> "It was so easy," said Quintero, who has taken night classes for the last year.  "They asked questions that you hear every day, like, 'Who was the first  President of the United States?' and 'Who can declare war in this country?' "  </P> <P> Maria Lafarga and her husband, who both got perfect scores on the test, agreed.  </P> <P> "I can't believe how easy it was. I was so nervous when I came in here," said  Lafarga, who hopes to work as a supermarket cashier. "I feel like a new  person."  </P> <P> </P> <P> WHERE TO TAKE TEST  </P> <P> These are the centers in Los Angeles County where amnesty applicants can take  the written exam. Applicants need an appointment before taking the test.  </P> <P> 300 N. Los Angeles St., Los Angeles  </P> <P> 1671 Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles  </P> <P> 1241 S.

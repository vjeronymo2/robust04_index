			<p><P> September 5, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOSANNAS HEARD FOR RICHARD THOMPSON  </P> <P> If Richard Thompson keeps doing shows like this, he could be in danger of  losing his standing as a "cult hero."  </P> <P> Though hailed by Rolling Stone as the creator of two of the best albums of the  last 20 years, and heavy with the hosannas of his musical peers, the British  singer-writer-guitarist is far from household-name status.  </P> <P> Yet, at Seattle's Bumbershoot Festival Friday, Thompson played to a packed  field of hard-core fans that was augmented by several thousand Thompson  novitiates. And by show's end you couldn't tell them apart, as, by way of a  third encore call, they sang the chorus refrain of Thompson's "Tear Stained  Letter" for minutes after he had left the stage. Earlier in the show, when he  asked for a throat lozenge, he'd been inundated with a Beatle-like hail of the  things. Can Shea Stadium gigs be far behind?  </P> <P> It has been two years since Thompson's most recent, typically wonderful and  practically unheard album, "Amnesia" was released, but he hardly has been  taking it easy since. Along with several solo tours -- including one that  brings him to the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano tonight -- he has:  composed and performed the soundtrack to an upcoming Taylor Hackford film;  assembled the soundtrack for a British TV documentary, "Hard Cash" (the album  is available domestically on the Green Linnet label); recorded a second avant  garde John French-Fred Frith-Henry Kaiser-Richard Thompson album (out soon on  Windham Hill); guested on albums by Maria McKee, Crowded House and others, and  written a musical he has since decided he doesn't like.  </P> <P> The Hackford film proved the most demanding. Interviewed last Friday before his  Seattle gig, Thompson described the film as "a lovable, wacky, Australian  romantic comedy," though the creation of it was evidently a bit less carefree.  Indicative perhaps of the second-guessing that goes on in the high-stakes film  world, "Sweet Persuasion" is the fifth title given the flick so far, and  Thompson wouldn't be surprised if it changes a few more times before its  release next March.  </P> <P> Unlike director Hackford's recent music bios -- "La Bamba" and "Chuck Berry --  Hail! Hail! Rock and Roll!" -- this film called for an original, acoustic-based  score, which the 41-year-old guitarist is singularly equipped to provide. Best  known for his terrifyingly emotive and intense electric work, Thompson was also  a founding member of Fairport Convention, the '60s band that pioneered the  exploration of centuries-old British folk styles. On acoustic guitar -- also  the chosen instrument for his solo gigs -- he has a command of styles ranging  from transposed 16th-Century Scottish pipe tunes to modern jazz. For the film  he also played mandolin, which he's none too feeble on either.  </P> <P> Though he reports he's "fairly pleased" with the result, Thompson wasn't  particularly enamored of the experience of doing a film. Whether recording for  independent labels of the majors, he has always held control over the integrity  of his musical visions. It was a new experience to be overruled at times on  those musical choices. "It's very difficult, especially when you think you're  right. It was overall a long and difficult experience, which I don't think I'd  take on again until the next millennium, which gives me 10 years.  </P> <P> "I'm not sure how the soundtrack will hold up as music. Very much with films,  the music is determined by what's required of the picture, which is why 'It  sounds like film music' can so often be a derogatory phrase. It's often so  boring, unless it's (Ennio) Morricone, Sir William Walton or Prokofiev. This  will be coming out on an album, so judge for yourself," he said with a laugh.  </P> <P> Though he is due to go in the studio next month to record his next Capitol  album, that project is still unsettled. He plans to team again with "Amnesia"  producer Mitchell Froom and will probably draw again from the "usual unusual"  crew of musicians who peopled that album. Beyond that, he said, it could go in  any number of directions, one being a divergent "concept album" he is loath to  go into much detail about. "David Byrne might read it and steal my ideas," he  joked.  </P> <P> If the final direction allows, he'd like to commit the new songs he's been  performing live to disc. Those include: "I Misunderstood," another of his  seemingly endless supply of heartbreakingly sad songs; "1952 Vincent Black  Lightning," a tale of motorcycle romance; "Why Must I Plead," described by  Thompson as "a kind of Celtic Aaron Neville thing," and "I Feel So Good," a  song that sounds uncharacteristically jubilant until one realizes its narrator  is a released convict contemplating new mayhems.  </P> <P> Though he likes nothing better than to have a free month in which to write, he  said songwriting is a non-stop process for him.  </P> <P> "It starts with anything: words, music, riffs, hooks, lines and sinkers --  ideas, concepts, television, telephone directories, it doesn't matter. I think  if you're going to write, you have to keep your ears and eyes open. When you're  hit with an idea you're always looking for other bits of that idea. You're  walking down the street and suddenly light bulbs go off and you take out your  little notebook.  </P> <P> "It's a full-time job, but the tax man doesn't believe that. I think I should  be allowed to write off everything in my life, because everything in my life is  relevant to my work, but they won't have it."  </P> <P> One thing that isn't particularly relevant to his work is contemporary pop  music. He doesn't listen to much of it, both because he wants to avoid copying  others and because: "I really like to be thrilled by music, so I try not to  listen to too much of it. When I do hear it, then it becomes more special."  </P> <P> His recent tastes run toward baritone sax-man Gerry Mulligan's older work,  opera and Madagascarian music. Whether listening to music or playing it, he's  looking for the same thing.  </P> <P> "It's the moments where the composer, player or players somehow just take off.  They loose themselves and the music just flies. Those are the great moments.  Playing, I think you aim to get lost in the music. You aim for excellence, even  if you never achieve it. But sometimes it gets that way despite you. Sometimes  with an audience you're able to communicate something, almost without  interfering with it. Something just flies from here to there, flies around the  room, and it's wonderful," Thompson exclaimed, adding with a laugh, "Then it's  gone."  </P> <P> "But I think there are moments where a performer touches an audience or when  there's a mutual raising of spirits or something. I think musicians have a  responsibility to tell the truth, to propagate ideas, to challenge people, if  you like, and to create beauty. Music is such an elusive thing, I think talking  about it is incredibly difficult, as I've just proved."  </P> <P>  Richard Thompson and Tuxedo Cowboy play at 8 p.m. at the Coach House, 33157  Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. Tickets: $17.50. Information: (714)  496-8930.  </P> <P> </P></p>

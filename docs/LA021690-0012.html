			<p><P> February 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DID THEY DO THE RIGHT THING?  </P> <P> All right, all right, so maybe it's not as important as perestroika or global  warming, but we live here and we take the Academy Awards seriously. Well, sort  of seriously. Seriously enough to be a little worked up about what our  President might call this Spike Lee thing.  </P> <P> Now, when director-writer Lee's brilliant exploration of American race  relations, "Do the Right Thing," was passed over by the jury at Cannes in favor  of the equally brilliant exploration of yuppie sexuality, "sex, lies and  videotape," we weren't surprised. After all, if you ask a Frenchman to choose  between a story of techno-seduction and one about a race riot at a pizza  parlor, you don't have to be Roland Barthes to know which way he's going to  jump.  </P> <P> On the other hand, the cultural imperatives operating in the deliberations of  our own Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences are a trifle murkier.  Surely, the academy cannot have been influenced by the fact that Lee's deal  with Universal Studios virtually forced him to make his film as a nonunion  production. Nor could any of the academy members have been turned off by his  sometimes rather abrasive personality. Heck, if tact were the price of  admission to Hollywood, Morton's would be empty every night. Similarly, no one  could have been offended by the assertive social attitudes expressed in Lee's  movie. If that were the standard, nobody would ever sit through another Wagner  opera or read a poem by Ezra Pound.  </P> <P> No, it's got to be something else. Race? Well, Danny Aiello was nominated as  best supporting actor for his role in "Do the Right Thing." Of course, he was  the white guy. Then there's the fact that "Glory," one of the finest films ever  made about the American Civil War, also was snubbed by the academy.  </P> <P> As Cardinal Newman said of his conversion: Cumulative probability leading to  subjective certainty.  </P></p>

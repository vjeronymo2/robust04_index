			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> LIONS CHEW UP SANTA CLARA'S WCAC HOPES  </P> <P> The West Coast Athletic Conference baseball race has apparently been whittled  to a two-team affair after Loyola kayoed Santa Clara in two seven-inning games  Saturday, 4-3 and 8-2, at Loyola.  </P> <P> Saturday's victories gave the Lions three straight over the 19th-ranked Broncos  and probably knocked third-place Santa Clara out of WCAC title contention.  </P> <P> The Lions, 17-1 in the WCAC and 35-18 for the season, have won 16 straight  conference games and 13 straight overall. Santa Clara fell to 11-8 in the WCAC  and is 36-19 overall. The teams conclude their series with a 1 p.m. game today  at Loyola, the Lions' last home game.  </P> <P> The Lions' dousing of Santa Clara sets up next week's season-ending series at  Pepperdine, which is 16-3 after sweeping USF Saturday.  </P> <P> In the first game, each team scored a run in the first inning. Loyola took a  3-1 lead in the second by bunching two walks, two hits and a sacrifice fly.  </P> <P> However, Loyola 10-game winner Kalani Bush again failed to make it through four  innings. The Broncos tied the game with two runs on three hits and a walk  against three pitchers in the fourth.  </P> <P> The game then settled into a pitchers' duel. Darryl Scott, the fourth Lion  hurler, came out of the bullpen to pitch the sixth and seventh innings, and  earned the victory when Loyola finally scratched out the winning run in the  sixth.  </P> <P> The Lions, who had been three-hit to that point by Broncos curveball pitcher  Vince Fultz, scored on an inning-opening walk and stolen base by Rick Allen and  a single by Brian Turang.  </P> <P> Scott improved to 5-6 with the win, while Fultz fell to 3-3.  </P> <P> The Lions collected nine hits in the nightcap, but the second game belonged to  sophomore left-hander Jon Willard, who was overpowering for five innings.  </P> <P> Loyola took advantage of Bronco starter Burch Boehner's wildness and some  shoddy defense to build a 8-1 lead after four innings.  </P> <P> Deuces were wild in the second as Loyola used two hits, two walks and two  errors to score four times. Outfielder Robert Cannon had the key hit, a two-run  single.  </P> <P> The Lions scored three more times in a nightmarish third inning for Santa  Clara, which made two more errors and saw reliever Tom Hotchkiss injure his  arm.  </P> <P> Loyola's eighth run came in the fourth when Cannon singled, stole second and  third and scored on Travis Tarchione's single.  </P> <P> Willard struck out five and allowed only five hits before being lifted with two  outs in the sixth. The victory raised him to 2-0. Boehner, who surrendered four  walks and three hits in 1 2/3 innings, fell to 5-5.  </P></p>

			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Aspirin for a lingering ailment: Venezuela's economic crisis will prove difficult to resolve Those who follow the world's emerging stock and bond markets often mince their words. But they are almost unified in their despair at the developments in Venezuela since the government of President Rafael Caldera took office in February. 'The Caldera administration has, (since) taking the reins of power, succeeded in shooting itself in the foot . . . and blowing away most of its good leg,' Mr Victor Galliano of LatInvest, a London-based stockbroker specialising in Latin American markets, told the firm's clients. According to Mr Peter West, an economist with West Merchant Bank, the London subsidiary of Germany's Westdeutsche Landesbank: 'The rapid deterioration in the country's economic situation this year under the Caldera government can only be seen as the unfolding of the worst case scenario.' In international financial circles, where Venezuela was until three years ago viewed as one of the most promising prospects in Latin America, the Caldera government is reckoned to have inherited an economy in bad shape and succeeded in making it worse. The financial markets now price Venezuela's Brady bonds, issued as part of the government's 1990 debt agreement with international banks, at levels comparable with Nigeria's. The view of foreign financiers may be the least of Mr Caldera's worries as he grapples with the crisis which, if it continues, may threaten the country's already fragile social and political fabric. Yet the country's fall from grace underlines the difficulties of managing an economy dominated by a single commodity, in this case oil. As the three biggest Latin American economies, Mexico, Brazil and Argentina, face presidential elections in the next 12 months, it may also demonstrate to other countries in the region the risks of authoritarian and populist responses to economic problems. With justification, the 78-year-old Mr Caldera blames others for the genesis of the crisis he now faces. Announcing wide-ranging new controls on the economy last month, he said: 'This crisis was not created by us. It is a crisis that is the product of a long period of corruption, of a long period of serious mistakes made in the life of the nation. We have tried to confront this crisis using all ordinary means, but we have arrived at the point where we feel the urgent need to use . . . extraordinary means.' These measures, announced on June 27, included the abolition of six constitutionally guaranteed economic freedoms, controls on foreign exchange operations and on the prices of many goods and services, an official pledge to push for lower interest rates, and the obligatory payment of a monthly 'bonus' to most government and private sector employees. Together, they constituted the most significant attempt to impose state control over an economy in Latin America since the 1980s. The government almost immediately put some of its new powers to work. Police, national guard soldiers and state security officers launched a series of raids aimed at apprehending criminals in the massive slums - barrios - around Venezuela's main cities. They jailed 'price speculators' and confiscated food products held by 'hoarders', as well as investigating individuals believed by the security police to be planning destabilisation efforts against the government. The measures were prompted by the worst banking crisis to hit Latin America since the collapse of the Chilean banking system 11 years ago. It was triggered by the failure of the country's second-largest bank, Banco Latino, in January - the culmination of years of lax regulation and doubtful lending. The state now owns a significant minority of the banking system and controls the rest. The knock-on effects threaten other enterprises - and some well-known business dynasties. Foreign exchange transactions formally restarted yesterday at a government-set fixed exchange rate of 170 bolivars to the dollar - after being forbidden for nearly two weeks. This followed near-collapse in the free-market price of the bolivar, which has fallen by half since the start of the year. As the government pumped in money to shore up the banks, the budget deficit widened, according to an International Monetary Fund document quoted in a Venezuelan newspaper, to 17.5 per cent of GDP this year. Inflation is rising  -to a forecast 70 per cent or more this year, from 46 per cent last - though, if price controls hold, inflation may be curbed. Overall, the economy is expected to contract for a second successive year - economists' expectations range between 3 per cent and 10 per cent. The roots of the problem, as Mr Caldera says, go back a long way. Oil made Venezuelans the richest citizens of Latin America, but encouraged them to view themselves as shareholders owed dividends by a rich enterprise. The country's latest period of democracy, which dates from 1958, survived by the judicious distribution of oil wealth. The oil boom of the 1970s brought an epoch of government extravagance and corruption. Throughout most of the 1980s, the government continued in this vein, failing to adjust to the collapse of oil prices. By the time Mr Carlos Andres Perez assumed power in 1989 for a second term as president, the state-dominated economic model, with high inflation and heavy government deficits, appeared to be in its death throes. Mr Perez initiated a series of market reforms. After price controls were abandoned in February 1989, 300 people were killed in food riots. The rentier mentality encouraged by oil wealth meant Venezuelans were always likely to find free-market medicine more unpalatable than other Latin Americans. Moreover, in retrospect, Mr Perez was ill-suited to the task of demanding economic sacrifice from his people. His 1970s government was regarded as one of the most venal in Venezuelan history. Last year, after facing two military uprisings in 1992, he was forced to step down early to face corruption charges and is now in jail. Mr Caldera's reputation is as austere as Mr Perez's was flamboyant. His victory in last December's elections followed a campaign emphasising energetic measures against corruption, inflation, and devaluation, and a rejection of market reforms. Some viewed it as a vote for nostalgia - Mr Caldera entered politics in the 1940s and his first term of office from 1969-74 seems a golden age in retrospect. But now he faces the problems of shortage, not the plenty of the 1970s. Like most Latin American politicians of his era, he is of an authoritarian cast and appears to have overruled his ministers on many occasions. 'The clearly interventionist nature of the new measures points strongly to Caldera himself as the architect of these misguided populist policies,' said Mr Galliano of LatInvest. The efficacy of the price and currency controls are widely doubted. Mr Francisco Vivancos, professor of economy at Andres Bello Catholic University in Caracas, says controls on prices and foreign exchange 'are like an aspirin that doesn't attack the illness'. Many economists believe the best hope lies in the statements from government officials that the measures will be 'temporary', and that price controls and the other actions could end in December. While controls are likely to be popular initially - as will the boost to salaries - if they last too long, hoarding, shortages and a high-priced black market could develop, causing popular dissatisfaction. The hopes that the policies will be reversed somewhat lies with a group of supposedly more market-oriented ministers - perhaps including Mr Julio Sosa, the finance minister. Mr Caldera has lost four cabinet ministers and the governor of the supposedly independent central bank, Mrs Ruth de Krivoy. According to Mr George Philip of the London School of Economics, the government now needs to take decisive fiscal measures to close the budget deficit. This will mean taking a tough line with depositors of the failed banks, higher taxes and public spending cuts. This, he argues, will bring about real political conflict, something Mr Caldera has avoided so far. Yet if he avoids this conflict, the alternative is hyperinflation. That is only likely to worsen the country's deep social and military tensions.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Availability of NPRMs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 94&hyph;NM&hyph;191&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Direction G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC), which is the airworthiness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority for France, recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain Airbus Model A310 and A300&hyph;600 series airplanes equipped with certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SOGERMA&hyph;SOCEA pilot, co-pilot, and third occupant seats. The DGAC advises that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> report has been received of failure of the bracket of the backrest recline control lock on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seat after the airplane accumulated 21,762 total flight hours. Investigation has revealed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the cause of this failure has been attributed to fatigue-related cracking. Fatigue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cracks and/or distortion of the bracket of the backrest recline control lock, if not detected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and corrected in a timely manner, could result in failure of the seat backrest attach  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fittings, and the subsequent uncommanded 50 angle recline of the pilot or co-pilot seat;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this situation could lead to the temporary inability of the pilots to control the airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> SOGERMA&hyph;SOCEA has issued Service Bulletin 25&hyph;229, dated November 26,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1993, which describes procedures for repetitive detailed visual inspections to detect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distortion and/or cracks on the attachment brackets of the backrest recline control locks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This service bulletin also describes procedures for replacement of both of the brackets  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and their associated attachment fittings with new parts, which would eliminate the need  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the repetitive inspections. The DGAC classified this service bulletin as mandatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and issued French airworthiness directive 94&hyph;188&hyph;162(B), dated August 17, 1994, in order  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in France.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> This airplane model is manufactured in France and is type certificated for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operation in the United States under the provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the DGAC has kept the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the DGAC, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would require repetitive detailed visual inspections to detect distortion and/or cracks on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the attachment brackets of the seat backrest recline control locks. This proposed AD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would also require replacement of both of the brackets and their associated attachment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fittings with new parts; this replacement would constitute terminating action for repetitive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspection requirements. The actions would be required to be accomplished in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordance with the service bulletin described previously.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> As a result of recent communications with the Air Transport Association (ATA)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of America, the FAA has learned that, in general, some operators may misunderstand the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> legal effect of AD's on airplanes that are identified in the applicability provision of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AD, but that have been altered or repaired in the area addressed by the AD. The FAA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> points out that all airplanes identified in the applicability provision of an AD are legally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to the AD. If an airplane has been altered or repaired in the affected area in such a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> way as to affect compliance with the AD, the owner or operator is required to obtain FAA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approval for an alternative method of compliance with the AD, in accordance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph of each AD that provides for such approvals. A note has been included in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice to clarify this requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> The FAA estimates that 49 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed AD, that it would take approximately 4 work hours per airplane to accomplish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour. Required parts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be supplied by the manufacturer at no cost to the operators. Based on these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $11,760, or $240 per airplane, per inspection cycle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Docket at the location provided under the caption  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> The Proposed Amendment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

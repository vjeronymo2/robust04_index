			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The terms ``agricultural solid waste,'' ``residential solid waste'' and ``leachate,'' are defined as they are in the regulations that govern solid waste under the authority of the Resource Recovery and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6901  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) and implemented at 40 CFR part 243, Guidelines for the Storage and Collection of Residential, Commercial, and Institutional Solid Waste. The term ``hazardous waste'' refers to the definition of such solid waste prescribed at 40 CFR part 261, Identification and Listing of Hazardous Wastes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Natural resources'' is defined here so as to provide a comprehensive inventory of the inherent attributes of National Park System units that may be affected by solid waste disposal sites. The detailed listing of resource attributes is designed to enable the agency and the regulated community sufficient consistency and specificity to evaluate potential effects to the parks. The Report of the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs (House Report 98&hyph;1069) that accompanied the Act said, ``the conditions of noise, air pollution, waste disposal in surrounding lands, rat and other pest problems, and area disruption due to heavy truck use that are created by these waste disposal sites have resulted in a deep concern over the degradation of park values.'' In another section, the Report stated ``The Committee notes that the operation of solid waste disposal sites within units of the National Park System causes deterioration of air and water quality, increases levels of mechanical noise, and has the potential to degrade land and water areas that are in relatively natural condition and areas containing significant cultural values, and that the operation of such disposal sites renders adjacent lands, and waters, unfit for full public use and enjoyment.'' In light of the Committee's broad findings concerning what may constitute natural resources affected by solid waste disposal sites, the drafters have chosen to provide a broad definition for this term. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The definition of the term ``National Park System,'' mirrors the statutory language of 16 U.S.C. 1c. The purpose in including it here is that the term is used in the statute. Defining it in the rule clarifies the applicability of the rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The definitions of the terms ``PCBs and PCB items'' and ``post closure care'' is the same as used by EPA. The terms ``PCBs and PCB items'' are defined by regulations at 40 CFR part 761, Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) Manufacturing, Distribution in Commerce, And Use Prohibitions. The terms ``closure'' and ``post closure care'' are described at 40 CFR part 258. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the heart of this regulatory package are the management and control of ``solid waste.'' The National Park Service defines the term similarly to that used in RCRA regulations at 40 CFR part 258. The broad definition of solid waste included here is intended to ensure that all potential sources of adverse effects to National Park System units from such sources come under the purview of the final rule. The rule also defines two classes of solid waste_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agricultural and residential_that may be exempt from the rule under clearly delineated circumstances. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the statute severely restricts the establishment of new ``(solid waste) disposal sites'' within units of the National Park System and because the term is central to any regulatory activities under the framework of the statute, it is defined in the rule. The definition is based on the statutory language in RCRA for the term ``disposal.'' The definition explicitly states that such sites include land or waters where such solid waste may be placed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final rule governs solid waste transfer stations but not recycling centers, sewage treatment plants, septic systems, or facilities for managing compostible materials. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 6.4&blank;Solid Waste Disposal Sites Not in Operation on September 1, 1984 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The regulation permits establishing new solid waste disposal sites after September 1, 1984, within units of the National Park System,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> only <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  with the approval of the Regional Director. This section does not apply to solid waste disposal sites in operation on September 1, 1984. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Regional Director may approve a permit for a new solid waste disposal site only under the stringent conditions outlined in the rule that are derived from the statute. The Act states that any new sites must be ``*&blank;*&blank;* used only for disposal of wastes generated within that unit of the park system *&blank;*&blank;*'' This is the basis for the first approval condition. The drafters have included the phrase ``solely from National Park Service activities'' in recognition of the fact that the Congress acknowledged that the National Park Service might need to operate solid waste disposal sites for its own management and associated activities. The Service believes that the statutory language ``wastes generated within that unit of the park system'' was meant to convey a nexus between the disposal sites and activities of the NPS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

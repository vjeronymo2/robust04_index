			<p>BFN     [Text] The Palestinians have announced that they do not  intend to induct into the police force Fatah Hawks and wanted  men who are not sanctioned by Israel. Our army affairs  correspondent Karmela Menashe reports that Brig. Gen. Yom-Tov  Sami', the liaison with the Palestinians, sought to check  reports that Uri Magidish's assassins had been inducted into the  Palestinian police. He was told that Fatah Hawks had been  concentrated in a classification camp, and that those who are  found to be qualified to be policemen would be inducted only  after Israel approves it.    Meanwhile, it has been learned that the policeman who banned  Brig. Gen. Doron Almog from traveling freely on roads in the  Gaza Strip has been brought to trial and sent to jail. IDF  [Israel Defense Forces] sources this morning expressed  satisfaction about the way Palestinian police roadblocks  checking Palestinians at the border crossings with Israel have  been working.</p>

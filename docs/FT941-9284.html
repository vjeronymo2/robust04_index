			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / FT Guide to the Winter Olympics (7): Age of the high-tech mini-camera - Television Technology / On the ski slopes, a miniature cable-car, running down rails parallel to the skier, gives vividly exciting side-shots of the competitor leaning into bends as the landscape rushes by Extraordinary technical effort goes into the creation of the Olympics on television. For every well-groomed presenter, grinning affably across a flower-laden coffee table, a dozen cameramen, sound recordists and unsung heroes are out in the snow giving their all for the pictures on your screen. Add to that the almost overwhelming complexity of the control rooms, communications networks and graphics systems at the International Broadcast Centre in Lillehammer and one understands why some old hands in sports broadcasting still refer to the show as 'the daily miracle.' Mainstream coverage at each event is the responsibility of NRK, the Norwegian state broadcaster. However, TV activity at some centres is delegated to partners with the depth of experience and innovative capacity to manage the task. At the luge and bobsleigh tracks, for example, the BBC is charged with getting the pictures to billions of viewers. Although Britain's gentleman Alpinists invented the bobsleigh at St Moritz, this is the first time the BBC has attempted to cover snowland's equivalent of Formula One motor racing. 'We've spent a lot of time learning and we anticipate having around 28 cameras to cover the two tracks,' said the BBC's executive producer Jim Reside. 'With so many curves in the two runs, there are places where a single camera can only catch the competitor for a second or two, but you must have that shot. 'We've also been experimenting with a high-speed camera which will 'run' down the track as the bob team accelerates.' Other broadcasters have been running trials with the winter equivalent of the miniature cameras mounted on Formula One race cars. Problems have arisen, ironically, because of the extreme environmental care with which the bob and luge tracks at Hunderfossen have been constructed. The overhanging branches of the protected pine trees obscure and break up the microwave links from the miniature camera to the helicopter overhead. One possible alternative source of pictures is the blimp which CBS plans to have overhead during the Games. Equally radical are CBS plans for 'cap-cam' in the ice-hockey stadium. If all teams agree, with the assent of the sport's ruling body, each goalkeeper will have a miniaturised TV camera broadcasting from within his helmet. Whether or not it will carry sound remains a secret. Perhaps now the armchair hockey fan will discover what it is the goalkeepers say to themselves while awaiting a penalty shot. On the ski slopes, the viewer is promised the advent of yet another 'cam': this time it is 'rail-cam'. A miniature cable-car, running down rails parallel to the skier, gives vividly exciting side-shots of the competitor leaning into bends as the landscape rushes by. It gives a sense of speed undreamt of by the conventional camera looking up and down the hill. At the ski-jump, a big concession has been made to the aesthetic considerations of television. Producers and directors claimed that the chairlift in the background, normally used to ferry competitors to the summit, was ruining picture composition. Following lengthy consultations, the chairs and cables will be removed for the duration of the Games and competitors will be taken to the start line by army lorry. For the BBC, Lillehammer represents another significant technical first. Via satellite, World Service Television will broadcast the BBC's version of the Olympics to a considerable new audience outside the UK itself.</p>

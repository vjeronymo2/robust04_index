			<p><P> October 14, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> EL CAMINO QUICKLY SHOCKS NO. 4 SAN PASQUAL  </P> <P> San Pasqual Coach Mike Dolan said he tried to simulate El Camino's quickness in  practice this week. Immediately Friday night, Dolan realized that was a foolish  proposition.  </P> <P> "We don't have anybody as quick as they do on our whole team," Dolan said after  his No. 4-ranked and previously undefeated team was outscored, 27-0, and  outgained, 330-39, at San Pasqual.  </P> <P> The victory gave No. 6 El Camino sole possession of first in the Avocado League  at 3-0. San Pasqual dropped to 1-1.  </P> <P> San Pasqual's defense never could seem to catch or find El Camino scatback  Brian Madlangbayan (5-feet-6, 165) or quarterback Joe Malek (5-4, 160). And its  offense could never come close to blocking El Camino's small-but-quick  linebackers, Peau Atoe, Dwayne Webb and Dennis Duren.  </P> <P> Madlangbayan ran for three touchdowns and 101 yards in 14 carries, and Malek  ran for 48 yards and a touchdown in nine rushes.  </P> <P> While the defense was searching high and low for them, fullback Von Robinson  was busting up the middle for 95 yards in 13 carries.  </P> <P> Madlangbayan said his team was playing with a little extra intensity.  </P> <P> "Last year they beat us twice; that just really stuck with me," Madlangbayan  said.  </P> <P> One of those two losses came in the 2-A playoff semifinals.  </P> <P> Webb, Atoe and Duren spent much of their evening in the San Pasqual backfield,  holding the vaunted San Pasqual rushing game to 30 yards in 23 carries -- more  than 200 yards under its average.  </P> <P> "You come out here, and you blink, and all of a sudden, he's doing chin-ups on  the quarterback's face mask," Dolan said of Atoe. "Those are the three quickest  linebackers we've seen.  </P> <P> El Camino played a nearly flawless in the first half, scoring on three of its  four drives and never punting.  </P> <P> El Camino outgained San Pasqual, 179-15, in the half and held San Pasqual  fullback Cullen Owen (100 yards a game) to four yards in four carries, one of  which was fumble that led to Madlangbayan's second touchdown, a 19-yard run.  Owen finished with 13 yards in five carries. San Pasqual's furthest penetration  was the San Pasqual 38 early in the fourth quarter. DAVE McKIBBEN  </P></p>

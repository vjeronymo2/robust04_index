			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Albert Kochetkov] </F>   [Text] Tbilisi April 20 TASS -- Georgian Deputy Interior  Minister Georgi Gulua, 38, who headed Georgian Transport Police,  fell another victim of terrorist acts this morning. He and his  two subordinates were riddled with bullets when they were  driving to his office. Terrorists escaped from the place of  crime unidentified.    This is the eighth terrorist act in Georgia against a  high-ranking government official over the past few months. Law  enforcement bodies could not identify executors of  assassinations even once.    Head of the State Security Service Igor Georgadze told  journalists at a recent news conference that Georgia is living  through a period of fierce struggle between mafia clans, and  that terrorist acts are inevitable.</p>

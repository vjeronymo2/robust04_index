			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Technology: I'll pay by hologram - Cheque security has entered a new dimension Just a few years ago, holograms were cheap and glitzy, a promotional gimmick on a cornflakes packet or decoration on a toy. But today, holograms - known to the initiated as optically variable devices (OVDs) - are proving increasingly popular as a means of preventing theft and fraud. Already widespread on rigid plastic credit cards, the Association for Payment Clearing Systems in the UK is drawing up standards for the shimmering slivers of foil to be used on cheques. The extent of cheque fraud is difficult to calculate. In 1990, Apacs believes it totalled about Pounds 17.7m, although that dropped in 1991. But many say the figure is far higher, with individuals and companies unaware they have been defrauded - or unwilling to admit it. Guy Johnson, of the West Midlands Police cheque squad, says this kind of theft is widespread and is replacing the traditional 'smash-and-grab'. The police face two problems. First, counterfeiting, where the name or value on a cheque is changed. Second, forgery where the basic document, such as a cheque, is copied. Forgery has become increasingly easy as colour photocopiers and colour scanners have enabled the dishonest to replicate cheques, tickets and vouchers. 'These are dangerous things because they are getting quite ubiquitous,' says Philip Hudson, managing director of De La Rue Holographics. 'They're also very difficult because the police can't trace the cheques: there are no tell-tale signs.' Ian Kellett, chief accountant with mail-order company Grattan, which plans to use cheques incorporating holograms from the new year, believes his company was quick to recognise the risks of such advanced technology because they themselves are users of it. 'We related to desktop publishing because we use it in our business for catalogue creation. We wanted to take the cheque out of this printing environment.' While complex patterns, fluorescent inserts and water marks have all failed to deter the dedicated forger, hologram makers believe their products will succeed because they are difficult to replicate. 'They can't be copied or photographed. To replicate them you would need the same technology as we have,' says Hamish Shearer, technical director of Applied Holographics. Producing a hologram requires clean rooms similar to those involved in semiconductor production. In brief, the hologram pattern is created by splitting a laser beam in two: half falls on a photographic plate; the other half shines on to the art work before reaching the plate. The way in which this pattern interferes with the pure beam determines the final hologram. After further processes, the plates are coated with molecules of pure silver, then topped with nickel. The plates are then used to build up a printing cylinder for mass production. Stephen Adams, divisional director of the security print and systems division of Kenrick &amp; Jefferson, believes OVDs should be used with other techniques to prevent fraud. 'We never advocate a single security feature,' says Adams. 'It has to be a more and more covert system to track the fraud down the line.' Johnson believes otherwise. He argues that the banks should spend their money on a single technology which cannot be copied and which is easily recognisable by everyone likely to handle the cheque - from the banker to the shopkeeper in the local store. 'Unless the receiver of the document knows what the document looks like, how can we stop counterfeiting?' asks Johnson. 'If the counterfeited document is rarely seen, such as a building society cheque, how do you know whether it is counterfeit or not?' Two obstacles had to be overcome to put holograms on cheques. The first was to ensure that the hologram stuck and could not be removed. The paper used for cheques is highly textured so adhesion can be difficult. And the heat and pressure needed to apply the OVD has to be carefully controlled so that it does not destroy other security features. The second was to ensure the integrity of automated cheque processing. If the hologram had been thick - it is just 2.5 microns, or millionths of a metre, deep - 'piggybacking' could occur, where the build up of a 'bump' in the pile of cheques results in some of them slipping through the automated process without being read. Estimates for the market growth of holograms for security and anti-counterfeiting vary widely. But Morris Weissman, chief executive officer of United States Banknote, one of the biggest hologram suppliers, reports market-growth of 75 to 80 per cent over the past year. 'We expect the same kind of growth in the coming year,' he adds. Manufacturers say this is because several drawbacks have been ironed out. Now the devices can be easily incorporated in factory production lines - just like a stick-on label. And prices are falling. The cost of putting holograms on cheques works out at less than 1p per cheque - conventional cheques cost three or four pence each. On top of that is the cost of designing the hologram - anything from Pounds 2,000 upwards. Other documents have already been given the hologram treatment. Wembley Stadium tickets contain holograms, as did all the tickets for the 1992 Olympic Games. Season tickets on the Illinois mass transport system in the US also bear an OVD as do postal stamps in several countries. Another big growth area is in packaging to ensure that seals on prescription drugs, software or video cassettes are not broken. Whether a company is distilling whisky or making jeans, holograms can help it protect its label. Appropriately, even Batman is in on the act. Every licensed Batman product sold in the US last year incorporated a hologram in the packaging.</p>

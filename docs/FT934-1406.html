			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Property: Treat yourself to a festive forest - Gerald Cadogan suggests that acquiring woodland makes sense as an investment this Christmas Why buy a Christmas tree when you can buy a forest? As a bulk purchase, they are cheaper. They can give pleasure and profit for generations to come. They are free of income and capital gains tax and qualify for 100 per cent business property relief from inheritance tax. And, if they are conifers, you have Christmas trees in perpetuity. A voucher for a forest is a gift with a difference. It means a minimum investment of Pounds 50,000 in Britain, says management firm Fountain Forestry, or Dollars 250,000 to invest in hardwoods in the United States. Around Dollars 95m will buy a whole 400,000-acre (160,000-hectare) forest in the US from agent John Clegg. Thanks to the influence of the Gulf Stream, Britain's climate is ideal for growing trees, especially such softwood varieties as pines. Native deciduous (or broadleaf) hardwoods take at least twice as long to mature but look better and belong in the British countryside - besides which, they attract higher goverment grants. These are paid under the woodland grant scheme. Planting grants for conifers range from Pounds 615 a hectare (one hectare equals 2.47 acres) for more than 10 hectares, to Pounds 1,005 for less than one hectare. For broadleaves, the grants range from Pounds 975 to Pounds 1,575, paid 70 per cent on planting, 20 per cent after five years and 10 per cent after 10 years. Then, the woodland management grant takes over for conifers 11-20 years old (Pounds 10-Pounds 15 a hectare per year), and broadleaves 11-40 years old (Pounds 25-Pounds 35). For woods of special environmental value, annual management grants offer Pounds 35-Pounds 45. An alternative scheme pays for natural regeneration. Two extras are the better land supplement (Pounds 400 or Pounds 600 on planting) for using arable land or improved grassland, and the community woodlands supplement of a flat Pounds 950 for woods close to towns or cities that are open to the public for recreation. These two grants can apply also to the farm woodland premium scheme. This has similar planting grants but its annual payments (Pounds 60-Pounds 250 a hectare) are for using farmland. If more than half the trees are broadleaves, the payments run for 15 years; if less than half, for 10 years. That explains the many newly-planted (usually hardwood) spinneys in the corners of fields which give cover for game to shoot and for other wildlife, make the farm look 'natural' and will, eventually, produce timber. The years are over of planting swathes of sitka spruce in straight lines over the hills of Scotland with no regard to the contours - 'carpets of Scandinavian gloom,' as they were called by the late Hugh Fraser MP. Certainly, a British timber supply was a top priority after both world wars (indeed, the Forestry Comission was founded in 1919). That is why it had such remarkable reliefs against tax, and still offers good pickings. But official wartime attitudes - aimed at planting lots of trees, quickly, without much regard to sensitivity - continued afterwards. Only now, spurred by environmental groups, do foresters have to mix the types and ages of trees and follow natural boundaries. The return on timber depends on the likely future price. While that is hard to assess, there are long-term bullish factors. Fountain Forestry says UK prices follow the changes in gross domestic product and that the present forestry yield, in real terms, beats real interest rates. Timber prices are on the up. Then include the tax exemptions, which make it attractive to buy woods planted after the war that are now ready for felling in order to harvest a tax-free income; or to plant broadleaves for future generations of family to look after, while enjoying the IHT relief. To qualify, the woods must be 'in hand,' which includes managed woods but not let woods (which have 50 per cent relief). Future markets are certain, provided the felled trees can be moved easily to the processing plant (grants for forest roads are one proposal before the government's Forestry Review Group, due to report early next year). Or, the plant should be brought to them. Huge investment in UK plants by Scandinavian and north European companies is a high mark of confidence. Since 1988, however, when the government ended a system whereby the wealthy could save tax by buying woodland and setting forestry expenses against all other income, new plantings and grants for them have been less than hoped. The target was 33,000 hectares a year, but it was 29,500 in 1988/89 and has fallen steadily - doubtless affected by the recession - to 17,300 hectares in the year ended March 31 1992, the last available figure. Another reason for this could be that the present system of farm grants under the EU's common agricultural policy makes a lot of land seem too valuable for mere trees. Take away farm grants and it would be a different story. A further reason - and a major grumble in forestry - is that you cannot plant trees in set-aside land - that which is taken out of use by farmers in return for payments from the EU. To new investors, broadleaves look best. But to ensure they reach perfection in 150 years needs planning down the family line, plus faith. And Pounds 50,000 buys few of them, with a price for 20-year-old semi-mature trees of Pounds 900-Pounds 1,000 (Dollars 1,350-Dollars 1,500) an acre. In the US, however, hardwoods cost about Dollars 250-Dollars 300 an acre, and they abound in the north-eastern states. Black cherry, especially, flourishes in these forests - an excellent wood for furniture which gets good prices, especially if it is veneer quality (the best). Hardwood prices In the US have risen 50 per cent recently and, with the difficulties of managing broadleaves of such quality or quantity in Europe, Fountain advises European investors to go west. It manages forests for them from its office near Concord, New Hampshire, and also runs a hardwood forest in eastern Kentucky. But it will find you a forest in Britain, too. Clegg has several UK forests for sale, mostly in Scotland. Since its recent British sales have tended to go for above the guide price, be bold and pop some woodland under the Christmas tree now.

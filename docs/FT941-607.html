			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / International Company News: VIB to take over competitor VIB, the third-largest bourse-listed property investment fund in the Netherlands, is to acquire its next-biggest rival, Innovest, through a share swap. The takeover will create the second-biggest Dutch property company with property assets of more than Fl 2.7bn (Dollars 1.42bn), well behind the market leader Rodamco and slightly ahead of Wereldhave, which is ranked second. VIB, with market capitalisation of around Fl 1.6bn, is to offer five of its own shares for every four shares of Innovest, which is capitalised at around Fl 640m. The two companies said in mid-December that they were investigating a merger.</p>

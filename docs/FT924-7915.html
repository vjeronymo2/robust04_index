			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Timber side behind decline at Rexmore Rexmore, the Liverpool-based contract furnishing and timber group, saw pre-tax profits tumble to Pounds 202,000 in the 27 weeks to October 3. The fall from last time's Pounds 639,000 came on turnover of Pounds 20.1m (Pounds 22.7m). Directors said the decline was mainly attributable to the discontinuance of the Albert H Letheren business and difficult conditions in the rest of the timber operations. The division incurred an operating deficit of Pounds 103,000 against profits of Pounds 300,000. Turnover was Pounds 5.27m (Pounds 5.95m). In contrast, the contract furnishing side held up well with operating profits of Pounds 829,000 (Pounds 863,000) from turnover of Pounds 13.5m (Pounds 13.1m). Earnings per share dipped to 0.95p (2.69p). The interim dividend is maintained at 0.7p.</p>

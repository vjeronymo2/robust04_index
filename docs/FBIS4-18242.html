			<p>BFN     [Text] The long-awaited meeting between Forza Italia and  Northern League delegations is reportedly under way at an  undisclosed location. Berlusconi and Bossi are expected to come  to an informal agreement over the formation of the next  government. This will not be easy because Bossi has already said  that he wants a Northern League politician [Roberto Maroni] to  be prime minister, while Berlusconi is himself bidding for the  job.    Berlusconi's spokesperson reports that the meeting is  proceeding well, while Maroni has said that a joint communique  will be issued at the end of the talks.</p>

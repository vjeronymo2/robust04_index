			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / Observer: Declasse It's not the best of new years for the World Bank's globe-trotting staff. In a cost-cutting drive by its president, former J P Morgan boss Lewis Preston, first-class air travel as a matter of course has been restricted to vice-presidents and above. For lesser mortals, it's business class on flights of under 12 hours, which covers nearly all Europe and Latin America. Preston's move will be popular in Washington where few officials enjoy comparable perks. But it could be embarrassing for Michel Camdessus, boss of the World Bank's sister organisation, the International Monetary Fund. His staff still take first-class travel for granted.</p>

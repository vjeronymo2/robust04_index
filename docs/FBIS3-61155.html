However, the  second congress of commodity producers of the country, which was  held in Krasnoyarsk, did more than just confirm it. Read the  article on page 2.    It appeared that it would be difficult for delegates to the  congress to avoid the temptation of getting embroiled in  political battles there. The situation in the country has become  too complicated, too "hot." However, the following appeal came  in the very first words spoken by Yu. Skokov, chairman of the  organizational committee for conducting the congress, which was  attended by representatives from 41 regions of Russia and eight  federation-wide delegations: Enough of finding out who is "Red"  in the audience and in the country, and who is not quite "Red,"  and of finding out what should be demanded first of all from the  powers that be. Russia has come to the point beyond which there  may only lie a national catastrophe. The domestic production of  commodities is the last stronghold, the last bastion of the  state.    Before the congress, documents were handed out to the  delegates, of which one deserves the closest attention. It is  "The State of the Economy of Russia (Analysis and Projection)"  prepared by the analysts of the Federation of Public  Associations of Commodity Producers of the country. It differed  greatly from government assessments which have been voiced  recently. For example, the decline in production in the year now  ending has exceeded the planned level by more than a factor of  two, and has been only slightly smaller than that of last year.  Investment in the production assets, which had been weakened to  begin with, continued to decline. Millions of people live below  the poverty line. Specialist-analysts estimate that this year  alone, $12 billion-$15 billion have been taken out of the  country both legally and illegally. A paradoxical situation  occurs: on the one hand, the stabilization of exports has been  registered, with imports falling by a factor of two; the  positive balance of foreign trade may reach $23 billion. On the  other hand, the foreign debt of Russia continues to grow: Russia  is not in a position to discharge even the reduced debt payments  (reduced by agreement with Western creditors).    Yu. Skokov built on this analysis in his report at the  congress: "Against the background of steady cutbacks in  production in virtually all sectors, zones have emerged in which  the slump has become particularly threatening. For example, the  reduction comes to about 50 percent in electrical engineering,  instrument making, machine-tool production, and light industry.  It is not reforms in the economy that are under way, but rather  the destruction of national commodity production. However, the  state and society must understand that by destroying the  domestic commodity producer, they are destroying themselves."    Similar assessments, even more sharply worded than Skokov's,  were voiced in presentations "from the field" made by the  largest industrialists of the country: managers of the  standard-bearing enterprises of the domestic machine building,  metallurgy, and the mining industry....    "I have rubbed shoulders with all reformers in Russia, up to  the president of the country. I queried everywhere: Are we  moving on the course that we want? However, all I heard in  response was: There is no alternative to the program of reforms  being implemented. To what program, who has seen it? Chubays  came to us in Omsk, and also said: Is this not  stabilization--credit is not being taken out at banks, there are  no lines in stores, the exchange rate of the dollar is not  changing.... However, the best stabilization is when everything  is at the zero mark--both consumption and production. This only  happens at a cemetery." (This is from a presentation by a  representative of the Omsk delegation).    This is an excerpt from another presentation, that by a  representative of commodity producers from Yekaterinburg, the  native city of the Russian president: "We are being deliberately  and very expertly destroyed. I recently met Gaydar in  Cheboksary. He was surprised: How come, are you still in  operation? I thought that you had shut down already.... They,  the present-day reformers, indeed miscalculated: they did not  take into account the survivability of the director community,  its ability to resist the deindustrialization of the country.  Could it be that the time has really come for us to `help' the  government? For example, if the volume of production at an  enterprise falls 50 percent, half the people are thrown out into  the street. Let them appeal to the reformers then rather than to  us, and complain about a drop in the standard of living and  delays in the payment of wages...."    A. Volskiy, president of the Russian Union of Industrialists  and Entrepreneurs, stressed in his presentation to the congress  in particular: "The fact of fragmentation of the industrialists  of the country, their splintering based on narrow corporate  interests, deserves to be condemned. Here is Gaydar creating his  association of private business which, for example, such  domestic giants as the Uralmash also joined. Why? Who would not  sell out for easy credit, for weighty sops from the boss? There  is the notorious Shumeyko, organizing his so-called  confederation of entrepreneurs of Russia, which nobody in the  Russian `backwaters' has got the foggiest notion about.  Apparently, it was also organized so that the branch of this  confederation in the United States could be headed by people who  are not strangers to Shumeyko--his daughter and son-in-law.  Gentlemen reformers, are you not something else? Meanwhile, here  we are wondering and wracking our brains over this issue: How  come the confused Russian people voted for Zhirinovskiy? As  always, we are looking for `scapegoats'--the press, television,  the absence of funds.... Who were the people to vote for? One  may have his hopes dashed, one may engage in wishful thinking,  finally, one may believe in yet another vain dream. Nobody has  ever succeeded in deceiving 100 million people all at  once--ever!"    I sat in the overcrowded auditorium of the Palace of Culture  of the metallurgical plant, in which the congress was held, and  could not help thinking: Who needed this--the destruction and  the virtual bringing to its knees of the domestic economy? Just  the way it was seven and a half decades ago. At that time,  Russia was also getting on its feet and growing stronger every  year--there were Putilov's enterprises, Morozov's textile mills,  and Tereshchenko's plants.... The Russian people have built all  kinds of things, having received the desired sip of freedom! Was  this not the foundation upon which it was possible to move ahead  quickly, turning the country into a truly prosperous region?    I would be less than truthful if I maintained that the  entire  two days of the proceedings of the congress in Krasnoyarsk were  devoted solely to the assessment and analysis of the situation  that has emerged in domestic commodity production. A proposal  was made in virtually each presentation at the congress: What  should be done in order to save the economy from ultimate  destruction, in order to save Russia?    Speaking at the congress, Arkadiy Volskiy responded to a  question with another question: "What did Roosevelt begin with  when he came to power? He immediately closed down all banks that  existed in the country. Only one-third of them were reopened as  long as two weeks later after auditing. Incidentally, they  operate in the United States to this day."    In Volskiy's opinion, the industrialists of the country need  their own political organization; the last election proved this.  Russia should be led by people who have a vested interest in its  prosperity.    However, there were other "points of view": For example, in  the opinion of A. Stepanov, chief of the Teplovodokanal  administration of the Vorkutaugol production association, the  creation of such a party is an issue for the remote future.  Right now they should immediately embark on utilizing the  potential of deputies elected to the State Duma. To be sure,  this will not be easy to do.    There were other opinions, which on certain points even  mutually refuted one another. However, the delegates were  unanimous on one point: a force capable of uniting all who are  interested in the genuine rather than illusory rebirth of the  Motherland should finally appear in Russia. The Federation of  Public Associations of Commodity Producers of Russia, which was  finally legally constituted in Krasnoyarsk, should become such a  force. Yu. Skokov was elected its first chairman. Commodity  producers have gotten the long-awaited opportunity, just as in  all states of the world, not just to assess the processes under  way in the country, but to influence the development of an  economic policy and the determination of strategy and tactics of  domestic commodity production. This will be facilitated by the  revised statute of the federation and the Declaration of Rights  of Russia's Commodity Producers, adopted at the congress, as  well as the mood in which the delegates went home. A telegram  addressed to the president and prime minister of the country, in  which the delegates demanded the suspension of the effect of the  Edict on the Taxation of Legal Entities on 1 January, became the  first "harbinger" of collective actions. Otherwise, it will only  be possible to refer to industrial production in Russia in the  past tense.    After the congress, I asked the first chairman of the  federation: Is he satisfied with membership in the federation  being for now structured on an utterly voluntary basis? If one  wants to, one belongs to the federation, and if not, there is no  helping it.... For example, in Japan or Germany nobody will  engage in business unless he joins the league of entrepreneurs.  The law would not let them....    Yuriy Vladimirovich responded: "We are already moving in  this  direction. We have invited the Chamber of Commerce and Industry  of the Russian Federation to become one of the founders. In the  already mentioned Germany, it is precisely a similar chamber  that issues entrepreneur licenses. If we fail to revive the  production of goods in the immediate future, nobody from abroad  will help us. Who needs us over there? In our country people  became rich not at all because they benefited Russia somehow,  but rather as a result of redistributing the national, people's  wealth in their favor. This is a typical Bolshevik technique: To  take everything away and....appropriate it right away. Of  course, it is easier to steal than to do something yourself.  However, can something significant be created if you keep  stealing from someone else shamelessly all the time?"    I agreed--of course, it cannot. And I thought that Russia  did  not get just the Federation of Public Associations of Commodity  Producers during the two days of the congress in Krasnoyarsk,  but possibly also a new national leader.</p>

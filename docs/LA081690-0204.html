			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> HOMEOWNERS DEFEAT APARTMENT COMPLEX  </P> <P> Arguing that their older West Anaheim neighborhood has been overrun by  apartment developments in recent years, members of a homeowners association  persuaded the City Council to reject a proposed 334-unit complex.  </P> <P> Members of the Orange Avenue Homeowners Assn. cited increased traffic, noise  and other ill-effects of overcrowding as reasons to retain the single-family  orientation of the area.  </P> <P> "We're talking about density. We're not against people making money on their  project," said Ruth Good, a member of the group who is also a Magnolia School  District board member.  </P> <P> The council voted 5 to 0 against the project, which would have placed a three-  or four-story building on 9.2 acres on Magnolia Avenue just north of Lincoln  Avenue. The council also voted unanimously to rezone the property so that fewer  housing units per lot will be allowed in the future.  </P> <P> The group is now gearing up to fight the next major project that residents say  threatens the quality of life in their neighborhood: a condominium complex that  would place 17 units on four acres.  </P> <P> "We've got so many apartments. Our area is getting so built up," Good said.  "Things have just snowballed. I just want my little piece of the pie to still  have a nice feel to it."  </P></p>

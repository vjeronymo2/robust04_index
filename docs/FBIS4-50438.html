			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Gao Shangquan, member of the </F> Preliminary Working Committee of the Preparatory Committee of  the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, by Henry Cheung;  place and date not given: "Breaking the Taboos of the Jobs  Market"]    [Text] Last December, when Chinese leaders raised the  banner of a "socialist labour market" in their grand reform plan  through 2000, few outside observers seemed quite sure what it  really meant. "It is an important breakthrough in the taboos of  the past," said Gao Shangquan, China's all-time champion of the  concept of a labour market, in a recent interview with Window.    Gao was deputy minister of the State Commission for  Restructuring the Economy from 1982 to 1990 and has been a key  member of the team which is designing China's market economy.  He is also China's chief economist on the Preliminary Working  Committee (PWC) for the future Hong Kong Special Administrative  Region.    The major breakthrough or, as the official press called it,  the most "earth-shaking" reform, has been to let the formerly  permanently employed workers in state-owned enterprises flow  into the marketplace--to trade their services and skills for  their "rice bowl" (instead of earning it by just being in  possession of an urban resident's card).    Workers in the state sector did get the message, even though  few of them would have cared to read the long-winded 50-point  official document. The document was released shortly after a  Beijing company manager returned from a business trip to the  prosperous Pearl River Delta where he had sold his firm's  assembly lines to a buyer in the south.    This meant his company would cease to exist and its staff  would join a former rival firm, under an arrangement with the  municipal authorities, even if only temporarily. But the  manager himself had made up his mind already; he had chosen  early retirement at the age of 50. Women workers in his factory  were entitled to early retirement at 45. "Next year I will go  down south on my own business trip," the electrical  technician-turned manager said. "I'll set up a small workshop  with a few friends of mine."    For years, the very concept of labour market was taboo in  China's "workers' paradise" economy. In the earlier reform  years, all kinds of euphemisms such as "service market" were  used for labour market which still remained an ideologically  unacceptable concept.    Things began to change last November when Gao urged in the  official press that it was time to call a spade a spade. This  was just several weeks before the concept of a labour market was  written into the official policy paper. Gao said it would be  unimaginable for a market economy not to have a labour market.  It would be "weird" economics if there was a market economy but  the door remained shut for people to prove what they could do  best by changing jobs.    Protection: [previous word published in boldface] But a  labour market should trade only labour, not the personal  freedoms of workers. And that was exactly the role to be played  by the government, he suggested, not by closing down the labour  market but by protecting workers' rights.    If workers lost their freedoms, the labour market would be  inefficient, he warned. What the government should do during  China's economic transition was to concentrate on building up  its market facilities and maintaining their orderly function,  instead of continuing to assign goods and jobs arbitrarily.    This would remove one major ideological distortion of the  economy. Observers of China's state-owned enterprises have long  claimed their managers are either saddled with too many  responsibilities (running factory kindergartens, for instance)  to concentrate on business or, because it takes so much hassle  for them to get rid of even one undisciplined worker, a  prerequisite for effective management, they seem to feel  entitled not to be responsible at all. Now, however, the latest  reform will provide enterprises with a competitive supply of  labour, enabling them to find whatever skills they need and  encourage workers' devotion to their work and sense of  discipline.    At the same time, as Gao noted, there has been a de facto  labour market in China since at least the mid-1980s. Even  outside farming, the state sector provides just 43 per cent of  job opportunities; the market's "the invisible hand has already  arranged jobs for more than half of China's off-farm labour.  Gao also pointed out that the market provided 60 per cent of  the work force for the transportation and telecommunication  industries, 67 per cent for hotels and restaurants and 77 per  cent for the building industry.    He believes that recognising this reality would help the  government make a more serious effort in looking for solutions  to problems, such as the shortage of jobs and the potentially  large number of lay-offs from state-owned enterprises. "The  most pressing problem right now is our state sector's welfare  reform." he said.    China's industrial welfare system is still to a large extent  factory-based, and pensioners are paid by their former  employers, for instance. A society-wide safety net is still an  experiment purely at the government's initiative.    The terms that the Beijing manager mentioned above received  after his factory's merger are perhaps of the best kind. In an  early retirement scheme, a worker (or a manager) is paid about  70 per cent of his former monthly income, along with most  medical bills. But if he possesses certain skills, he can set  up his own shop or work as an independent contractor.    This is part of the welfare reform experiment in which the  merger, or sometimes the government, takes care of the welfare  of laid-off workers. "There are still a lot of details to be  worked out in the state sector's welfare reform," Gao explained.  "This year, according to last December's reform plan, is meant  to be a year of reform in China. But how much reform we can  actually make will depend on the economy's health in the middle  of the year." This period could be an extremely difficult time  for workers in state-owned enterprises.    Gao was born in 1929 and graduated from St John's University  in 1952 as an economics major. Apart from his appointment on  the PWC, he also holds a number of other important positions  including vice- chairman of the Chinese Society for  Restructuring the Economy and honorary professorships in some of  China's best universities.</p>

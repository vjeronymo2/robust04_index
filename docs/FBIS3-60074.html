One of the country's most wanted men, Chavez  arrived in Lima last night, 15 hours after he was captured and  deported from Colombia. He was immediately taken to the  Dirandro cells, where he will remain for 15 days under  investigation, according to existing laws.    It was reported no ad hoc prosecutor has been named to file  the corresponding charges, although the drug trafficker has  claimed innocence. Dirandro said Vaticano faces five summons on  drug-trafficking charges. He will be presented to the media  once the police investigation concludes.</p>

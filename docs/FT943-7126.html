			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Lloyd's agent in Bermuda link A Lloyd's agent is teaming up with a Bermudian securities house to raise fresh capital for the insurance market. Venton Underwriting Agencies is turning to Butterfield Securities, a subsidiary of Bermuda's Bank of Butterfield, to raise up to Pounds 25m from UK, Bermudian and international investors. The agency aims to increase business written by its three syndicates - numbers 376, 1038 and 1183 - but does not plan to list the fund on the London Stock Exchange immediately. The new initiative is one of a number of so-called 'dedicated' vehicles that are under consideration by managing agencies. Lloyd's is tipped to raise up to an additional Pounds 250m in corporate funds, allowing it to increase corporate capacity - the ability to accept premiums - by up to Pounds 500m for the 1995 underwriting year. Institutional investors raised more than Pounds 800m for the market last year, with most of this capital invested in investment trusts supporting a range of agents and syndicates. Venton syndicates have a combined capacity of Pounds 185m. Syndicate 376, which writes non-marine reinsurance, more than doubled its capacity this year, increasing from less than Pounds 49m to more than Pounds 100m. Separately, the Association of Lloyd's Members, the biggest organisation of individual Names, yesterday forecast that Lloyd's would make profits of between Pounds 900m and Pounds 1.15bn from business underwritten in its 1993 underwriting year. The forecast, based on work by Financial Intelligence and Research, the insurance analyst, is more optimistic than that of its rival Chatset, which earlier this week predicted profits of Pounds 800m. Both, however, expect 1992 to produce an overall loss of about Pounds 1bn. Lloyd's will report its results for 1992 and 1993 over the next two years in line with its three-year accounting system.</p>

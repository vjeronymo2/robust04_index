			<p><P> June 28, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STRIPPING AWAY THE QUOTA BARNACLES;  </P> <P> COURT HAS REAFFIRMED COMMITMENT TO CIVIL RIGHTS FOR ALL  </P> <P> The Supreme Court is closing the 1988 term with a ringing reaffirmation of  America's unyielding commitment to civil rights for all its citizens, whatever  their race, gender, religion or ethnic background. The principle of  nondiscrimination, for which so many marched in the 1960s, has at last been  stripped of the quota barnacles that became an encrusted feature in the 1970s  and is once again restored atop the equal- opportunity pedestal.  </P> <P> To be sure, the court has struggled to reach this point, speaking more often  than not with multiple voices, and, in some instances, even with forked tongue.  But a solid and reliable majority has emerged to provide the kind of clarity of  thinking and purpose needed to fulfill Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream of a  nation that will one day judge its children "not by the color of their skin but  by the content of their character."  </P> <P> What the Supreme Court held in its series of civil rights decisions can be  simply stated: All who have a claim of discrimination, whether it moves in  forward gear or reverse, shall have access to the courts (Martin vs. Wilkes).  Once through the courthouse door, plaintiffs must prove their case, not simply  by reference to statistical imbalances or numerical under-representation  (although statistics are certainly an acceptable "starting point"), but also,  and most important, with hard evidence showing that the disproportionate  numbers are indeed the result of discriminatory conduct (Ward's Cove Packing  Co. vs. Atonio). The remedy that then follows must be "narrowly tailored" to  fit the proven wrong and cure the identified injury, not cast more broadly to  provide group-oriented relief in the form of racial quotas or minority  set-asides, except as a rare last resort measure (Richmond vs. J.A. Croson).  </P> <P> The court's message is unmistakably clear. Discrimination, whether labeled  benign or pernicious, will not be countenanced. This includes remedial programs  that favor some but disfavor others because of race. The negative preference  has at last been expunged from affirmative action. No more is race to be pitted  against race for openings in the workplace or the classroom. Latinos,  Asian-Americans, blacks, whites and all others are to be treated equally; none  can use skin color or ethnic background for advantage, or turn to those  characteristics to disadvantage others.  </P> <P> No one loses under these court decisions; everyone is a winner. The promise of  equality means nothing to anyone if it does not mean the same thing to  everyone. What once was almost exclusively a black-white issue is that no more.  Asian-Americans are outperforming other minorities in college admissions exams  in such numbers that some universities have placed a quota limit on the number  to be admitted under their so-called "affirmative action" programs (shades of  an earlier discriminatory quota used against Jewish students seeking college  admission). Latinos, too, often face employee preferences that benefit only  blacks and women; there is nothing very "affirmative" about that action.  </P> <P> We can now put such racially inspired programs behind us. The Supreme Court has  said that all must play by the same rule and can expect the same intense  scrutiny. Affirmative action in its traditional sense -- active recruitment,  outreach and training programs to ensure a wide open selection process based on  individual talent and worth -- is back in vogue, cleansed of the negative  preference that has for too long needlessly and cynically divided society along  racial lines. It is the content of one's character and quality of performance  that must now determine who gets into and through school or is hired or  promoted. No longer must minorities live with the nagging self-doubts that come  with the certain knowledge that their "affirmative action" selection was under  a more relaxed standard that devalued their achievement. Success will have to  come the hard way: It must be earned. Is that not what equal opportunity and  civil rights are all about?  </P> <P> That is the question that will now be put to Congress as some disgruntled quota  advocates take their cause to the Hill. The public-policy debate is one that  should be waged. Stripped of all its polemical rhetoric, it reduces to a most  straightforward question: Are we for or against resurrecting the negative  preference of affirmative action?  </P> <P> Do we want enforcement of our civil rights to depend on whether racial  proportionality has been achieved or will be maintained? If so, Congress will  have to legislate that employers run afoul of the civil-rights laws on no more  than a statistical showing of racial imbalance in their work force. And if the  "racial quota" is indeed to be the public-policy preference in this country for  correcting under-representation -- if we are really intent on buying into  "benign" discrimination as the corrective for that which is pernicious -- then  it is for Congress to make that legislative judgment specifically.  </P> <P> The Supreme Court has declined such an invitation. It has recognized -- as  should we all -- that the principle of nondiscrimination is indeed colorblind.  For that ideal to be compromised, in whatever fashion and for whatever reason,  is to lose the principle, perhaps forever, to the poorer compromise. I agree  with the court's majority: We have fought for civil rights too often and too  long to allow so ignoble a surrender of so important and so cherished an ideal.  </P></p>

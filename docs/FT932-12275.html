			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Gas companies urge wider competition THE UK gas market could become fully competitive by 2000, which would cut 10 per cent off the cost of most residential gas bills and lead to savings of Pounds 400m in the entire market, a plan put forward by three independent gas marketing companies suggests. Alliance Gas, Utilicorp UK and Total Gas Marketing propose in a report drawn up by accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand a timetable for the introduction of competition to the domestic market by 1995 and a stringent system of licensing for suppliers to households. The three companies say they would be willing to agree to a price cap similar to that of British Gas and to set service standards. Mr Kristoffer Maroe, managing director of Alliance Gas, a joint venture between British Petroleum and Norway's Statoil, dismissed claims by British Gas that as many as 12m households would pay higher bills in a more open market as propaganda. 'There are only winners,' he said. Mr Peter Bryant, deputy chairman of Utilicorp UK - the UK arm of the US utility, said: 'It's absolutely clear that the industry as a whole is very dissatisfied with the current debate on gas. What is needed is a new approach and a change of thinking.' Total Gas Marketing is an offshoot of the French Total oil group. Between them, the three companies have joint ventures with most of the UK's regional electricity companies. The Coopers report is to be submitted to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, which is looking at the structure of the gas industry and is due to make its report by the end of July. Mr Bryant said the commission's inquiry had not taken into account the way in which competition could be introduced to households. The three companies want to see a separation of British Gas's pipelines network and marketing, but do not necessarily advocate a break-up of the company. Sir James McKinnon, the industry regulator, said the report 'demonstrates that competitors are willing and able to shoulder the responsibilities of serving a fully competitive market'. He called on British Gas to open up a new dialogue on the future of the industry. British Gas said that the right forum for debate was the MMC.</p>

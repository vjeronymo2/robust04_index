			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Colonel A. Nizhalovskiy, candidate of </F> historical sciences and docent, under the rubric "From the  Directorate of the Chief of Engineering Troops of the Russian  Federation's Ministry of Defense" : "An Assembly of  Administrative Personnel of the Engineering Troops"]    [Text] In accordance with the plan for training the Russian  Federation's armed forces a special operational assembly was  conducted at the end of August 1993 under the supervision of  Colonel-General V. Kuznetsov. This was the first such assembly  on this level in the Russian Army.    More than two years had gone by since the last assembly,  that  one was in the Soviet Armed Forces. During that time a  considerable portion of the engineering troops transferred to  the armies of the independent states, former republics of the  USSR, to industrial enterprises and design offices.    Russia's engineering troops have now taken shape, and the  administrative personnel have been 40-percent renewed. There  have been large changes also in the nature, the scope and the  organization of engineer support missions. There are new weapon  models and ammunition, and the conditions surrounding their  safekeeping and operation have become more complicated. That is,  there have been fundamental changes in the conditions for the  functioning of the engineering troops and in views on their  combat employment and path of development.    The first day of activity was devoted to theoretical issues.  In his report Col-Gen Kuznetsov summed up the results of the  first stage of the development of Russia's engineering troops  and told about prospects for their development and the main  missions which must be accomplished in the immediate future. He  also touched upon problems arising as a result of the altered  geopolitical circumstances, the collapse of the USSR and the  transition to market conditions. These were further developed in  reports and speeches by deputy chiefs of engineering troops of  the Russian Federation's Ministry of Defense, the chiefs of  leading departments at the Military Engineering Academy imeni  V.V. Kuybyshev and a representative of the General Staff  Military Academy.    The assembly participants were particularly concerned about  the fact that the scope of engineer support missions is tending  to grow. The periods allowed for their execution is being  reduced or remains the same, but the size of these forces is  dropping considerably in the situation of reform of the Russian  Army. This is reflected primarily in the fortification equipment  of lines and positions, the establishment of engineer obstacles  and the performance of operational and tactical camouflage  measures.    It is obvious in this situation that it would be expedient  to  revise the deadlines involved and the extent of the  fortifications, making protection of the personnel against  weapons the keystone. In setting up the system of engineer  obstacles we need to switch decisively from the mining of areas  to the mining of specific facilities, the laying of most mixed  minefields in the course of combat operations, on revealed  sectors of enemy operations. Success in the execution of  engineer measures will depend to a large extent upon the use of  the latest facilities and the improvement of camouflage  measures, and the enlistment not just of engineering subunits  but also, and primarily, subunits of the troop army and branches  of the armed forces for the performance of these missions.    Considerable problems are arising in the course of  establishing new groupings of engineer troops. The withdrawal of  a large number of formations and units of troops and their  settlement within Russia, with a simultaneous reduction in  numerical strength and the lack of vacant military posts,  particularly housing, are making it impossible to set up  groupings of engineer troops in the classical sense. This  requires a great deal of effort not just of the command element  of the engineer troops but also the commanders of the military  districts.    Assembly participants considered such urgent problems as  moral and psychological support for the operations of the  engineer troops and indoctrination of the personnel at the  modern level of their functioning.    Recently, given the withdrawal of troops and the large-scale  removal of ammunition from the groups of forces, we are faced  with a drastic exacerbation of the crime situation in the  nation, with the problem of safeguarding the weapons and  ammunition moving to the fore. The latter was the subject of  discussion on the second day of the assembly. Classes were held  at one of the arsenals of the engineer troops. Specific  recommendations were worked out for safeguarding special  ammunition in the districts and armies, and ways to solve the  problems were outlined.    The third day was equally repleted and useful. For six hours  the participants were acquainted with new models of engineering  equipment and ammunition, prospective directions for the  development of engineer weapons were discussed, and experience  in their employment in various areas of the nation and at hot  spots was exchanged. The assembly participants learned with  great interest about the extent and the organization of  engineering missions and the specific features of engineer  installations on the Tajik-Afghan border. After all, matters of  fortifying the border sectors, coverning the sectors with the  greatest mine danger and provisioning the troops with water  following the tragic July events at the 12th Border Post have  moved to the forefront.    A class on means and methods of operational and tactical  camouflage was equally interesting and instructive. It was set  up at the training center of the Military Engineering Academy  imeni V.V. Kuybyshev. The entire complex of means of camouflage  and simulation--from the simplest of fire arms to a missile  complex--was graphically represented there. The assembly  participants were further convinced of the multilevel nature and  complexity of camouflage measures.    Unquestionably the new models of engineer equipment, the new  engineering ammunition and the prospective means of camouflage  are all making it possible to raise the techniques and the  organization of engineer support missions to a higher  qualitative level. Due to difficulties with financing, however,  the production of many new models not inferior to their Western  counterparts in efficiency and originality of technical  solutions is becoming a big problem.    At the conclusion of the assembly the chief of engineering  troops of the Russian Federation's Ministry of Defense summed up  the results and set missions for all areas of activity of the  engineer troops, taking into account existing economic, social  and financial circumstances. The objectives set for the assembly  were met in their entirety. Its participants were not only  enriched with new knowledge but also took with them into the  forces numerous reference books and aids, and recommendations  for carrying out the missions in the new circumstances.

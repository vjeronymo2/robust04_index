			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / China imposes freeze on pay in state enterprises: Austerity drive targets loss-making public sector CHINA has imposed a wage freeze on employees of bloated state enterprises as part of its austerity drive to regain control of a runaway economy. The authorities have also warned that state enterprises which make no effort to pay off their debts - a widespread problem - would gradually lose their subsidies. Mr Zhu Rongji, senior vice-premier in charge of the economy, called yesterday for an accelerated programme of economic reform to deal with the country's overheating economy. 'We should carry out the rectification by means of reform, accelerate the reform on the basis of rectification and lose no time in promoting reform,' he told a meeting of Chinese bankers. The latest measures to curb waste in the loss-making and overmanned state sector indicate that China may at last be preparing to tackle one of its biggest economic challenges. But problems in this area are so deep-rooted that even if a determined start is made now, it will take the authorities years to bring the situation under control. An official in China's labour ministry was quoted yesterday in the English-language China Daily as saying that the payment of wages, bonuses, allowances, subsidies and commissions had 'run out of control'. Urban employees' wages have risen by 21.7 per cent in the first six months of this year, compared with the same period last year. State-owned industry paid out Yn41.29bn (Pounds 4.87bn) in bonuses, during the first six months of this year, 38 per cent more than the same period in 1992. China's economy grew by 13.9 per cent in the six months to June. The cost of living rocketed by more than 17 per cent in the same period, panicking the leadership into a severe programme of retrenchment, including a credit squeeze and a crackdown on speculative real estate development. Western economists in Beijing estimate that more than 50 per cent of China's state enterprises are losing money. Total annual losses are estimated at around Yn100bn. There are more than 10,000 small, medium and large state enterprises. Mr Rongji who was appointed to head the People's Bank, China's central bank, last month, is responsible for a wide-ranging economic stabilisation programme that aims to bring inflation down below 10 per cent within the next six to 12 months. The programme's other objectives include restraining money supply growth, curbing investment in fixed assets and combating rampant speculation in real estate and commodities.

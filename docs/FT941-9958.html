			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Uncertainty reigns in absence of a transaction - The greatest concern over Lloyds Bank: what it will do with its money No bank which made a Pounds 1bn profit last year, as Lloyds Bank is expected to announce this morning, can exactly be said to be in trouble. Yet Lloyds' mantle as the most successful and profitable of Britain's banks shows signs of slipping. The clearest evidence of this is in its share price, which although it outperformed the FT-SE-A All-Share index last year, rising 23.6 per cent, lagged behind the rises of other banks. As investors bought the shares of banks with the most obvious recovery potential, Lloyds was gradually de-rated. It is appropriate that Lloyds should lead the results season for the big UK clearers, for it is already demonstrating the challenges that others could face in the next two years as they recover. Investors question whether it will hand back its strong capital in dividends, or expand by acquisition. 'People wonder about what Lloyds will do next, and some of that uncertainty is reflected in the share price,' says Mr Rod Barrett, bank analyst at Goldman Sachs. But he argues that the underperformance is due mainly to growing confidence that other banks can replicate Lloyds' past successes. Lloyds' manoeuvres under Mr Brian Pitman, chief executive, have been both negative and positive. Negative ones were to exit from poorly-performing businesses such as international banking and merchant banking in the 1980s, and to refrain from selling its portfolio of problem country debt. Mr Pitman's achievement was to focus earlier than others on domestic retail banking, and its spread into the French model of 'bancassurance.' He did so by acquiring a 60 per cent stake in Lloyds Abbey Life, and rooting a life insurance business within it. These moves helped raise return on equity to 21.3 per cent in the first half of last year. The release of problem country debt provisions smoothed the effect of the UK recession. Some Pounds 122m was released in the first half, and Pounds 80m of interest arrears is expected to be written back in the second half. Yet analysts point to the underlying sluggishness of the core retail banking business. Lloyds is expected to report virtually flat operating profits before bad debt provisions because its margins are under pressure, and it will not have the gains enjoyed by other banks from buoyant securities trading. The results are expected to show a continuing slackness of UK loan demand, which is holding back the revenue growth of all banks. Lloyds Abbey Life also faces difficulties selling products to Lloyds customers because of controversy over the selling of life insurance products and pensions. Mr Barrett argues that Lloyds is unlikely to repeat its early growth. 'The idea of bancassurance will be questioned. Banks thought that it was an easy way of making money through branches, but it gets harder as they sell more complicated products to sophisticated customers,' he says. For all that, Mr John Leonard, a banks analyst at Salomon Brothers in London, says that Lloyds still has 'further to go' in cutting costs and raising revenues in its core business. He believes it is also likely to gain more than other banks from recovery in the south-east of England. The problem with simply continuing to squeeze profits from Lloyds' existing network and products is that analysts expect a further fall in margins as other banks rebuild their capital and are able to compete aggressively. This could mean pressure on Lloyds' historically high equity returns. This problem bears on what remains the greatest uncertainty over Lloyds: what the bank will do with its money. Since its failed attempt to acquire Midland Bank in 1992, there has been speculation over which financial services operation it might buy to expand its customer base and squeeze unit costs. There are two difficulties in doing so. One is that it has set a high return on equity hurdle for an acquisition in order to prevent a dilution of its own shareholder returns. A second is that other banks have become much more expensive in the past two years, and would now test Lloyds' purse. The first difficulty may have been eased by the fact that its target return on equity for an acquisition may have to fall because of reductions in interest rates. The second difficulty means that Lloyds may be more likely to take on a building society, despite the regulatory barriers. Mr Leonard believes that Lloyds feels under no immediate pressure to do anything. 'I have not got the sense that they feel themselves to be in a strategic box.' Yet Mr Pitman has said that Lloyds would become over-capitalised if its ratio of equity to assets rose above 6 per cent. Other things being equal, this could happen by 1995, which is also the year in which Mr Pitman is due to retire. This is itself becoming a pressing issue, because he has no obvious successor. Unless a clear signal emerges today, questions over the future are only likely to increase.</p>

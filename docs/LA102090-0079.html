			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FAILED TWO-POINT CONVERSION ATTEMPT SAVES ESTANCIA  </P> <P> Estancia High School linebacker Taro Miyazawa led the right side of a defensive  line that stopped Laguna Beach running back Jason Levinson a yard short of a  two-point conversion Friday night, ending a fourth-quarter comeback by the  Artists and sealing the Eagles' 21-20 Pacific Coast League victory at Laguna  Beach.  </P> <P> Keith Perry had scored on a one-yard touchdown run with 2:20 to play, all but  eliminating Estancia's 21-7 fourth-quarter lead, and Laguna Beach Coach Lyman  Olney decided to go for two points and the victory.  </P> <P> But Levinson's off-tackle run was stopped short, and Estancia ran out the clock  after recovering Laguna Beach's subsequent onside kick attempt.  </P> <P> The Artists' comeback was led by wide receiver Eric Fegraus, who caught a  76-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Morgan Lanchantin to cut the deficit to  seven points with 10 minutes left and a key 37-yard pass from Lanchantin during  the 80-yard drive that ended with Perry's touchdown.  </P> <P> Bill Sandro and David Hong led the Eagles (2-5, 1-1). Sandro ran for 158 yards  and a touchdown in 27 carries, and Hong gained 95 yards and a touchdown on 10  carries.  </P> <P> Laguna Beach is 2-5, 0-2.  </P></p>

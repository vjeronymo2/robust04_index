			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / Arts: Today's Television First work in BBC Proms Live (7.30 BBC2 and Radio 3) is '(K) ein Sommernacht straum' or '(Not) A Midsummer Night's Dream' by Schnittke, played by the Oslo Philharmonic under conductor Mariss Jansons. They also play Richard Strauss's outsize 'Alpine Symphony', beginning at about 8.40. In between comes Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto, with Japanese soloist Midori. She began her career as an 11-year-old prodigy, recorded this concerto at 15 and now, at 21, is making her Proms debut. World In Action has had a neat idea: after all the accounts of British tourists' misfortunes abroad, they have sent a reporter undercover to see how tourists fare in Britain. The answer seems to be: ripped off by minicabs and ticket touts (8.30 ITV). A former ticket tout is central to the ITV drama series Frank Stubbs Promotes (9.00). The opening series ends today with Stubbs, played by Timothy Spall, turning himself into a literary agent. Come Dancing ends its series with a Dutch/British contest (11.05 BBC1).</p>

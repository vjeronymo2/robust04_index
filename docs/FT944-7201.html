			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / International Company News: Toronto Dominion doublesearnings Toronto Dominion Bank more than doubled earnings in its latest fiscal year, and has raised its dividend. The bank, Canada's fifth largest, lifted earnings to CDollars 683m (USDollars 497.5m), or CDollars 2.14 a share, in the 12 months to October 31, from CDollars 275m, or 82 cents, a year earlier. The quarterly dividend has been increased to 22 cents from 20 cents a share. Fourth-quarter earnings soared to CDollars 195m, or 62 cents a share, from CDollars 82m, or 25 cents. The bank said it was especially pleased with the improvement in its loans portfolio. Loan losses, originally forecast at CDollars 450m, totalled CDollars 345m, in spite of an extra general provision of CDollars 38m. As a result, fourth-quarter write-downs were only CDollars 32m, down from CDollars 150m last year. Non-performing loans dropped to CDollars 727m on October 31 from CDollars 1.22bn a year earlier. The bank forecast a further improvement in 1995, based on continued economic recovery and momentum in new businesses such as expanded discount brokerage and credit-card activities.</p>

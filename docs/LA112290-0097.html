			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> EDUCATION;  </P> <P> PASS THE WORD -- A STRONG VOCABULARY IS THE KEY TO SUCCESS  </P> <P> The importance of a strong vocabulary for children cannot be overstated.  Students with the best vocabulary perform the best in college entrance exams  and job interviews, and well-spoken people also have the upper hand in almost  every imaginable social situation.  </P> <P> Grade school is the best time to start helping your child develop language  skills. There are many ways that you can do this while having fun and  strengthening your bond with your grade-school child.  </P> <P> The easiest and most important way to enlarge your child's vocabulary is by  taking turns reading out loud, said Ilene Rotenberg, a teacher at Westminster  Computer Magnet School in Venice. "It sounds obvious," Rotenberg said, "but so  many parents don't do it."  </P> <P> Before reading together, pull out all of the words that you think your child  may not know and go over them. This way the student will read smoothly and  confidently without stumbling over unfamiliar words.  </P> <P> To find out which words you can expect your child to know, ask his or her  teacher for a copy of the Dolch List, which contains 220 words that are most  vital for reading in primary grades. The list contains 76% of the words used in  first-grade books, 69% of those in second-grade books and 62% of the words in  third-grade books.  </P> <P> The list of 300 "Instant Words," edited by Edward Fry, is also useful because  it has about 65% of words read by children and adults. Amazingly, just the  first 10 words on the list represent about a quarter of all printed English  words.  </P> <P> Make sure you have age-appropriate reading materials in the home. There are  many magazines published just for children, but a favorite among Rotenberg's  fifth- and sixth-graders is "Stone Soup."  </P> <P> "It's all written by children, all the articles, stories and poetry, and the  art as well," she said. "Highlight" and "Cricket," which carry stories and word  puzzles for elementary school children, are also popular.  </P> <P> One of the best resources for expanding your child's vocabulary is the  newspaper. It offers a variety of topics that children like, such as comics,  horoscopes, sports play-by-plays and album charts. "You can make a game out of  the newspaper," Rotenberg said. "I have my students read the want ads and I ask  them to find me a new car or a job."  </P> <P> To help your student decipher words, keep a children's dictionary handy.  Bookstores usually carry a variety of colorful and widely differing  "beginner's" dictionaries, so choose the one your child seems most interested  in.  </P> <P> Computer software is a powerful tool for vocabulary-building, and there are  dozens of inexpensive educational packages. Many adventure programs are also  good linguistic workouts because they make the child learn to follow  directions, recognize word clues, and detect double or hidden meanings.  </P> <P> Kristin Cady, a fifth-grader at Grant Elementary School in Santa Monica, has  learned more than a hundred words from the "Reading Rabbit" software program,  which features word games. "It's fun and it makes me more interested in reading  and learning words," Kristin said. "If you do things right, the little rabbit  dances and it's really funny."  </P> <P> "If you want kids to learn words, it has to be a game," said Kristin's father,  Patrick Cady, a teacher at Santa Monica High. "Words have got to be seen as  friends and tools, as well as academic." He suggested playing some simple word  games with your child to make new words seem more friendly.  </P> <P> Crossword puzzles are probably the most popular word game in America, and are  very easy to find. Bookstores carry volumes and weekly magazines are full of  them, and The Times provides one every day. Crosswords are great for learning  synonyms and spelling.  </P> <P> Finally, "Wheel of Fortune," minus Vanna's evening gowns and Pat's jokes, is  actually a good exercise in vocabulary-building. Along with the contestants,  your child can guess and spell the secret word or phrase. "Wheel" can help your  kid practice spelling, separating vowels from consonants and classifying words.  </P> <P> Educators and business leaders agree that vocabulary can affect your child's  ability to get good grades, admission to college and the right job. Make sure  your child develops a vocabulary that provides him or her with a competitive  edge.  </P></p>

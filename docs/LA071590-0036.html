			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WASHINGTON IRVING'S 'TALES OF THE ALHAMBRA' RELIVED ON ROMANTIC TOUR OF GRANADA  PALACE  </P> <P> Give him alms, woman, for there is nothing in life, nothing, so sad as to be  blind in Granada.  </P> <P>  -- Francisco de Icaza  </P> <P> Washington slept here. Washington Irving, that is.  </P> <P> Irving, the author and diplomat, left Madrid in 1829 and traveled south to the  Andalusia region. Accompanied by a Russian friend, he ventured to Granada on a  solitary mountain road then controlled by bandits.  </P> <P> A century ahead of Ernest Hemingway, Irving wrote of his travels in Spain.  Inspired by his book "Tales of the Alhambra," my husband and I visited Granada  and the Alhambra as part of an Andalusian holiday.  </P> <P> The Alhambra, a palace and fortress high above the city, was the last Moorish  bastion on the Iberian Peninsula and residence of the Spanish Christian  royalty, Ferdinand and Isabella.  </P> <P> In the early 1700s, the palace started to decay and the city remained pretty  much ignored by travelers for the rest of the century.  </P> <P> During the romantic l9th Century, Granada attracted artists such as Claude  Debussy, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas. But it was Irving's writings that had  the strongest impact on Granada's fame. Thousands of travelers come daily to  visit this town in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada Mountains.  </P> <P> Searching for the spirit of Irving's tales, we walked up to the Albacin. This  old Moorish quarter is a cluster of whitewashed houses and winding streets.  </P> <P> A horseshoe arch, piercing the remnants of an ancient wall, opened into a long,  green plaza. Families sat on benches. An old man, leaning on his cane, raised  his head. "Welcome to the Albaicin," he said.  </P> <P> A ball rolled by, with a child in pursuit. Two girls in tight-fitting skirts --  one orange, the other bright green -- leisurely swayed by, arm in arm. All the  men turned their heads, including the old man. Water splashed behind us. It was  an old woman, emptying a bucket in the gutter. The sound of laughter, music and  plates clanking from a cafe attracted our attention. The smell of food invited  us in.  </P> <P> Inside, flamenco music poured from a cassette player. My husband, a flamenco  aficionado, asked a regular about the singer and the conversation immediately  turned to the popular dance form.  </P> <P> "Oye, Pepe!" shouted our new acquaintance, to a slender, sharp-featured man.  "Give us a song."  </P> <P> As if only waiting for the invitation, Pepe came over and began to sing. He  kept the rhythm by softly clapping his hands. His concentration was total.  Conversation came to a halt. His voice rose, clear and sharp. Pepe's friends  encouraged him. With a clap and a stomp he finished, and everyone cheered.  </P> <P> After we left the cafe, Antonio, a local we had met in the cafe, took us to see  examples of Moorish architecture. A contractor, he grudgingly remarked, "Old  heritage is all very well, but a man can no longer put up a board, much less  tear down a brick in his own home, before the city inspectors come running to  check that it's done right."  </P> <P> Speaking fast, with a classic Andalusian accent, Antonio said: "Since you like  old houses, I'll give you a tip. You simply have to see Dar-al Horra Palace.  It's precious, and right here in Albaicin, too."  </P> <P> Following Antonio's directions, we ended up in a narrow street running parallel  to the ancient city wall. A small sign marked the entrance. An older man opened  it and peeked out, seemingly surprised to see visitors. His wife joined him to  guide us around.  </P> <P> In the center of a cool patio, a dormant basin reflected sun rays to the wall.  Lush, green plants filled every corner of the cool oasis. The rooms had  decorated walls, beautiful arches and carved woodwork.  </P> <P> Dar-al Horra, explained the caretaker, meant "House of the Queen." It once  belonged to the mother of Boabdil, the last Moorish king of Granada. In the  15th Century, the palace was one of the centers of power in the city.  </P> <P> From a tower, we overlooked luxurious gardens and pools of rich, modern homes  literally clinging to the city wall.  </P> <P> "See the white church, up in Sacromonte?" asked the caretaker's wife, speaking  to my husband, who is a photographer. "That's San Miguel El Alto. You can take  pretty pictures from up there."  </P> <P> Farther up the hill, heading to the Sacromonte, Gypsies accosted us with offers  to see "authentic" flamenco. Climbing past the last houses, we ventured into a  winding path, bordered by thorns and uninhabited caves. The view from the  church was breathtaking. A green valley separated the Albaicin from the  Alhambra.  </P> <P> Alhambra is an Arabic word that describes a reddish color. True to its name,  the palace glowed with the afternoon sun against a backdrop of snow-covered  mountains.  </P> <P> Fat, yellow letters by a hole in the wall caught my eye: "Ojo ladrones" (watch  out for thieves). I was struck by the solitude of the spot. Heeding the  warning, we retreated, past caves and shacks. Perhaps the descendants of the  smugglers who frightened Washington Irving still lurked about.  </P> <P> Plaza Nueva, at the foot of the Alhambra, is busy in the morning. The outdoor  tables at Cafe Lisboa were filled. Behind us, two businessmen discussed a trip  while dunking churros in hot chocolate. Another man gulped his espresso in one  sip, put down the payment and rushed off. He stopped at the corner, picked up a  paper and ran across the busy street. Waiters in white jackets and black pants  darted between tables, elegantly balancing their shiny metal trays.  </P> <P> Finishing the morning coffee ritual, we were ready for the climb up the narrow  Cuesta Gomerez to the Alhambra. Guitar makers and souvenir shops dotted the  street. Copies of Irving's book, in several languages, were displayed in every  window. Taxis zoomed past. I wished we had taken one. A bus barely squeezed  through the narrow Gate of the Granadas farther up the hill.  </P> <P> It was at this gate, I had read, that Irving met Mateo Jimenez, a Gypsy who  called himself "Son of the Alhambra." In Irving's account, Jimenez negotiated  for a room with the squatters who had taken over the palace and became the  American's guide, storyteller and valet.  </P> <P> We were welcomed to The Alhambra by a Gypsy woman who gave me a red carnation.  "Toma guapa, te la regalo (here you are, honey, it's a gift)," she said.  Seconds later, she began to ask me for money. Annoyed, I returned the wilting  flower.  </P> <P> Walking under a soft canopy of trees, we reached the entrance, the Gate of  Justice. Above the outer arch of the Moorish tower, a large hand is carved into  the stone. A key also appears over the inner arch.  </P> <P> These symbols of Moslem faith were given a different meaning by popular belief  in Irving's days. The founder of the palace was a magician who cast a spell on  the buildings. On the day when the hand would reach down and grasp the key,  legend had it, the spell would break and the palace would crumble to ruins,  revealing all the treasures hidden by the fleeing Moors.  </P> <P> I was first impressed by the extraordinary carved walls inside the Nazaride  palace of the Alhambra. Twisting passages and steps disoriented me. Through a  small door I came out into the light. Next to an oblong pool, past an  elaborately adorned colonnade, is the Hall of Ambassadors.  </P> <P> The walls shine with colorful tiles and meandering Arabic inscriptions. Ornate  arches support an immense wooden cupola.  </P> <P> I entered a small doorway, walked a few steps and was bombarded by golden light  and patterns of shadow. A forest of slender columns with intricately decorated  capitals created a feeling of weightlessness. I was in the Courtyard of the  Lions, named after a fountain supported on the backs of a dozen stone lions.  </P> <P> A basin in the adjacent Hall of Abencerrajes reflects the columns and gardens  outside. The space suddenly filled with a tour group. Their English-speaking  guide related Irving's tale of the 36 knights who were decapitated here by the  jealous and vengeful Boabdil.  </P> <P> A Spanish group came in, followed by a French group. Their voices, multiplied  by the echo, rang in my ears. I found myself staring at a red spot on the  floor, pointed out by a guide. Before my eyes it seemed to transform itself  into a dark pool of blood. I rushed out to get some air.  </P> <P> We were shown Irving's quarters, normally closed to the public. Above the door,  a plaque commemorates the creation of his tales. Originally built for King  Charles V, the rooms are fully furnished, including a piano supposedly used by  Irving.  </P> <P> He had an excellent view over the white Albaicin. In the city far below, the  bells of the cathedral rang for Mass. Next to the immense Renaissance church is  the Royal Chapel, mausoleum of Ferdinand and Isabella.  </P> <P> The grand interior is centered around their reclining marble statues.  Underneath, in the narrow crypt, simple coffins momentarily reduce the  legendary kings to ordinary mortals.  </P> <P> At 6 p.m., the streets filled with people taking an afternoon paseo, or stroll.  Most cafes and bars were packed. On the sidewalks, people stood in groups  talking, with beer or Coke in hand. Weaving our way through the crowds, we  entered the nearest bar.  </P> <P> While we ordered tapas, a young man asked us where we were from. In a natural  Andalusian manner, he invited us for unas copas (glasses of wine) and  introduced us to his friends, all students at the University of Granada.  </P> <P> The sun set the skies ablaze. From a terrace at the Albaicin, we watched the  Sierra Nevada and the Alhambra take warmer tones with the setting sun.  </P> <P> The white walls of the Generalife, the royal summer retreat above the Alhambra,  were surrounded by lush, green gardens. In Irving's "Pilgrim of Love," a king  built the palace to shelter his son from the temptations of love.  </P> <P> I, too, found it difficult to leave, and was reminded of something Irving once  wrote: "A little further and Granada, the Vega and the Alhambra, were shut from  my view and thus ended one of the pleasantest dreams of a life which the reader  perhaps may think has been but too much made up of dreams."  </P></p>

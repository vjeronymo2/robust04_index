			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: Pierson expands in UK options PIERSON GROUP, the Dutch merchant bank owned by ABN Amro, is making further inroads into the UK futures and options business. It is taking over Citioptions, the options clearing house owned by Citicorp, and becoming a minority shareholder in a new London-based futures and options broker. Pierson, through its London subsidiary, International Clearing Services, last year acquired the clearing business of LIT Futures to add to that of Anglo-Dutch Options which it already owned. The move thus gives it a leading position in options clearing at the London Traded Options Market, ahead of the market's planned merger with the London International Financial Futures Exchange. It will take a 30 per cent holding in the new broker, Monument Derivatives, with a further 30 per cent being held by Cygnus, a UK investment consortium owned by 48 international companies and institutions. The remaining 40 per cent is being held by management, led by Mr Martin Burton, a former director of Citicorp Scrimgeour Vickers. The broker will work on an agency basis and will not take positions for its book. According to Mr Burton, the existence of clearers such as Pierson, backed by a highly-rated bank, makes it possible for small groups to establish derivatives businesses with the strong capital base of the clearer providing essential support for the transaction. This could help to unwind the trend towards larger, more integrated houses seen in the 1980s. Monument will be a member of the London Stock Exchange and the LTOM, and will apply for Liffe membership.</p>

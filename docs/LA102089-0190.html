Barney Frank (D-Mass.) today denied a published report that he engaged in  sexual misconduct in the House gym and predicted that any ethics committee  investigation of the allegation would support him.  </P> <P> The Washington Times reported in today's editions that the committee has  evidence of sexual misconduct by Frank and several other members in the gym, in  the sub-basement of the Rayburn House Office Building.  </P> <P> In a statement, Frank called the allegations "completely untrue . . . and I am  confident that the ethics committee will concur."  </P> <P> The conservative newspaper quoted a male prostitute, Stephen Gobie, as saying  he and Frank performed sex acts "on a couple of occasions" after hours in the  private House gymnasium. The newspaper also said it had confirmed that Frank  had brought "a number of young men" to the gym.  </P></p>

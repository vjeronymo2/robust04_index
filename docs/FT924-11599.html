			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Letter: Responsible lending Sir, It seems a very odd response to a problem created by lending too much, to permit even more to be lent ('Borrowing rule change for housing market', October 21). It may be the expedient answer in the present situation - expedient for the lenders, that is - but unless it is made impossible in the future for lenders to look beyond the value of the property for repayment, the problem will persist. It is naive but understandable that borrowers rely for advice on those in whose interest it is to lend the maximum. . If liability is limited to the value of the mortgaged property, lenders will take their position more responsibly. Steven T Slaughter, Henfield Place, Henfield, Sussex BN5 9PH</p>

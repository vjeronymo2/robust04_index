			<p>BFN     [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 26/4/1994 -- The military  delegation of the Republic of Moldova, which had been invited to  today's reunion of the heads of major general staffs of NATO  countries and partner states, did not leave for Brussels,  announced to BASA informed sources from the Minister of Defence  (MD) from Chisinau. Anatol Cosciug, the chief of the military  policy and treaties section of the MD of Moldova, said that the  fact that the Moldovan delegation did not attend the reunion in  Brussels is not connected with the refusal of Russia to sign the  "Partnership for Peace" NATO program. Cosciug, excluding any  political aspect, indicated that the Embassy of Belgium in  Moscow didn't manage to issue the necessary visas. The Moldovan  delegation was to be headed by Pavel Chirau, the chief of the  General Staff of the Military Forces of Moldova.</p>

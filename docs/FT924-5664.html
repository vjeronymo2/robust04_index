			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: News from the US brings share rally A TUG-OF-WAR in the London stock market ended in a victory for the bulls yesterday afternoon when share prices regained ground rapidly on good news about the US economy. Less convincing was the sudden rash of rumours that European central banks had put pressure on the Bundesbank to cut German interest rates. Earlier trading had seen the FT-SE Index fall by more than 18 points to within five points of the 2,700 mark against a background of continued turmoil in the currency markets and new signs of recessionary pressures in the UK. The recovery came late in the afternoon and was sparked by Wall Street's positive response to a sharp rise in US consumer confidence disclosed by the Conference Board; the Board's confidence indicator registered 65.5 for November, compared with a readjusted 54.6 in October, and the Dow Industrial Average was 26 points ahead in London trading hours. Led by a sharply extended premium on the Footsie December futures contract over the cash market, equities rallied quickly and moved into positive territory in the final minutes of the somewhat erratic trading session. The final reading showed the FT-SE Index at 2,727.1 for a net gain of 4.2 on the day. Trading volume, sluggish at first, increased smartly as the market turned higher. The day's Seaq total of 578.4m shares compared with 461.3m on the previous day when the value of retail business slipped to Pounds 855.2m. Equity strategists were not over-impressed by the late upturn in yesterday's market, preferring to remain somewhat cautious. Several leading securities houses were believed to be warning clients that the UK stock market might have moved 'ahead of events'. Mr Ian Harnett at Strauss Turnbull said that fund managers appeared unwilling to buy the London market on fundamental valuation at present, noting also that the yield relative of gilts to equities had returned to about two times this week. At the start of trading, equities refused to respond to an urgent call for interest rate cuts in Germany from Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the exchequer. Any hopes of such a move were later discouraged by the fall in the Frankfurt stock market on news that Germany's money supply rose sharply in October. News from the corporate trading front remained relatively negative for equity investors. Shell disclosed that it was making heavy redundancies at an oil refinery in the north of England, and the Dutch chairman of Unilever was quoted as seeing no improvement in trading conditions. International blue chips and other US-orientated stocks rallied sharply with Wall Street and Shell managed to close higher on the day. Hopes that the European countries will make every effort to reduce interest rates despite the uncertainties in currencies helped to keep most store and retail issues firm. But the stock market, although evidently determined to hold firm above Footsie 2,700, remained well short of the peaks recorded last May. Several strategists repeated the view that only an imminent cut in interest rates would be likely to drive equities further ahead at present.</p>

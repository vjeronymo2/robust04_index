			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "Improved Relations Between Ankara </F> and Tel Aviv"]    [Text] President Ezer Weizman arrived in Ankara for a  four-day visit to Turkey on 24 January. Effective security  measures have been taken to protect him. Weizman was invited by  President Demirel. His arrival in Ankara is regarded as his  first visit to a foreign country after he was elected to serve  as Israel's president.    The officials in Ankara and Tel Aviv have described his  visit  as vital. Meanwhile, Weizman has said that his first visit to  Turkey is very important for Israel.    It is common knowledge that the relations between Ankara and  Tel Aviv have improved noticeably in the economic and military  fields during the past few years. It is also common knowledge  that the Zionist regime and the Turkish Government have  maintained high-level relations for a long time. Turkey was the  first Islamic country to officially recognize Israel on 28 March  1949.    President Demirel has said that the objective behind  Weizman's visit is the improvement of relations between Ankara  and Tel Aviv, which have existed since 1948. Several experts  have linked the improvement of relations between Turkey and  Israel to their common interests, stressing that the  geopolitical conditions in the Middle East after the agreement  the PLO reached with Israel have given momentum to the relations  between the two countries.    Meanwhile, the Zionist officials believe that the  strengthening of the Islamic movements in the Middle East pose a  threat to Israel's security. In fact, Prime Minister Rabin has  recently described the Islamic movements in the region as a  threat to the Middle East peace process.    Tel Aviv is convinced that Turkey plays an important role in  the region not only because it supports the Zionist regime but  also because it is an Islamic country governed by a secular  administration and has significant water resources and advanced  technology, which enables it to manufacture F-16 aircraft. As  such, Turkey can meet Israel's vital needs. For example, it can  supply water to Israel.    It has been reported that Demirel and Weizman have held  talks  on the joint use of water resources in the region, developments  in the Middle East, the agreement between the PLO and Israel,  and the improvement of bilateral cooperation between the two  countries.    However, considering a possible reaction by Turkey's Islamic  people, the Turkish officials must try to find a logical  explanation for the recent improvement of relations between  Ankara and Tel Aviv.</p>

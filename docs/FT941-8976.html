			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Tory chiefs aim to heal splits in party Conservative managers plan a drive to rally the party behind Mr John Major before a triple campaign for local, parliamentary and European elections starts in earnest. Party strategists are concerned that the political fall-out from Mr Major's troubled Back to Basics initiative is being compounded by a festering split on Europe. They fear that internal divisions could undermine hopes of avoiding humiliation in the local elections, three Commons by-elections in May and the European poll in June. Mr Major was given a significant boost last night by Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, in a speech to the rightwing 92 Group of Conservative MPs. His speech, to an audience which has frequently been hostile to Mr Major, amounted to an attempt to dispel suggestions that cabinet rightwingers were not giving Mr Major full support. Mr Lilley praised the 'clarity' of the prime minister's views on Europe and insisted that Mr Major was 'the only person who can lead a united party to victory in the next general election'. Party officials are concerned, however, that a split on federalism may burst into the open next week when the European People's party publishes its European election manifesto. Tory strategists plan to use speeches by cabinet ministers at the weekend to distance the party from the federalist EPP, which includes several conservative delegations in the European parliament. The speeches will stress that the EPP manifesto is not binding on Conservative candidates in an attempt to forestall criticism from rightwing Euro-sceptics such as Lord Tebbit. Officials say the intention is to link Britain's sustained economic recovery to the opt-out which Mr Major secured from the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty. The prime minister is expected to stress the need for party unity during the second of a series of regional tours - a two-day visit to Scotland starting tonight. On his return from Moscow last night Mr Major was presented with a difficult decision on whether to fight rebel Conservative peers who have virtually wrecked the government's controversial police bill. An escalation of the row over parliamentary business was headed off yesterday when Tory MPs on the Commons trade and industry committee decided against pressing ahead immediately with their threatened coup against Mr Richard Caborn, the committee's Labour chairman. The MPs - who form a majority on the committee - passed a motion giving Mr Caborn a two-week stay. They expect him to use this period to take 'appropriate steps' to halt what they regard as 'unacceptable interference' with the committee's freedom of action. Mr Caborn said last night he would make 'appropriate representations' to carry out the terms of the resolution.</p>

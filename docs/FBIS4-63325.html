			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Anatoliy Yershov report: "Nizhniy Novgorod Governor </F> Rumored Dismissed"]    [Text] Nizhniy Novgorod -- Over the past few days Nizhniy  Novgorod newspaper editorial offices and the radio and  television have been sent on official oblast administration  notepaper copies of a letter from Governor B. Nemtsov asking the  Russian president to relieve both him and Ye. Krestyaninov, the  president's representative in Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast, of their  duties.    The reason for this resignation is that economic reform in  the oblast has allegedly been a disaster, a wave of  anti-Semitism is on the rise, and, under these conditions,  "people must not be fooled any longer...." Whereas before there  were sometimes rumors about Governor B. Nemtsov's possibly  transferring to work in Moscow, this time the "resignation  question" regarding the two oblast leaders has turned out to be  a crude forgery.    IZVESTIYA was told by Ye. Krestyaninov that the appropriate  organs will now be investigating just who sent these letters to  the mass media.</p>

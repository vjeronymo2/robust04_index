			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: UP AGAINST A BERLIN WALL IN SEARCH FOR THE FACTS  </P> <P> Christmas comes to San Diego. Or: Ich bin ein consumer.  </P> <P>  Suddenly Santa is everywhere.  </P> <P> In Mission Beach, Santa rides a 10-speed and wears cutoffs. In Encinitas, Santa  appears at a Ralphs store and gets a Brie break every hour.  </P> <P> In Del Mar, Santa rides a red Kawasaki. He's a land appraiser delivering  presents to real estate firms.  </P> <P> I am at May Co. in Mission Valley. I have come to check on sales for a  late-starting novelty: 1-ounce chunks of the Berlin Wall, $10 each, complete  with tiny pouch and declaration of authenticity.  </P> <P> The store is thick with shoppers. I hear the rocks before I see them.  </P> <P> "Look, Gloria, there they are," Amy Sherwood, 76, who lives in Santee, says to  her friend and neighbor Gloria Atkinson, 63. "It's a rock of history."  </P> <P> Sherwood and Atkinson look but do not buy. Sherwood drifts off to inspect a  Euroshaver with vibrating twin blades for her grandson, a Carlsbad contractor.  </P> <P> That's common. What was once the coldest symbol of a divided Europe is now a  come-hither item, luring shoppers who end up buying ties and bulky-knit  sweaters and ski goggles.  </P> <P> Marydell McQuillen, 37, office manager for a computer firm in Kearny Mesa, buys  a rock for her husband. She bought one last week for her brother-in-law.  </P> <P> "It's truly for the person who has everything," she explains.  </P> <P> I ask a clerk how many rocks have been sold. I have bumbled into Checkpoint  Charlie.  </P> <P> "You'll have to talk to corporate headquarters in Los Angeles."  </P> <P> I sneak away and ask another clerk. This time I do not offer name, rank and  affiliation.  </P> <P> "Sales are good."  </P> <P> "Who's buying the rocks?"  </P> <P> "Mostly just average people."  </P> <P> The clerk thereby fulfills the first rule of Christmas retailing: Give the  reporter what he wants.  </P> <P> Keep Reading . . .  </P> <P> Here's some more.  </P> <P> * Sagon Penn has changed his name, resumed his martial arts career and broken  up with the woman who gave birth to his child.  </P> <P> He also danced briefly with a male go-go group at Saxx, a nightclub in  Southeast San Diego. G-strings only.  </P> <P> * I said a Bush Light.  </P> <P> The Volunteer Project, a nonprofit group that recruits and trains volunteers  for social service projects throughout San Diego, has received a Point of Light  award for community service from the President.  </P> <P> * Libertarians don't win many elections, but they do have fun.  </P> <P> Take Dennis Thompson, owner of a San Diego computer firm who is running for  governor as a Libertarian.  </P> <P> Thompson doesn't like Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp's proposal to tax candy. So  he sent Van de Kamp a box of sourball candies to show his displeasure. No  response yet.  </P> <P> "I'll probably hear from his dentist," Thompson said.  </P> <P> Supremacy and 1st Amendment  </P> <P> The Oregon chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union is considering a  request from Fallbrook white supremacist Tom Metzger for legal help in a damage  suit filed against him in Portland.  </P> <P> The suit claims Metzger's rhetoric incited three skinheads to beat an Ethiopian  man to death in 1988. Metzger says the suit has a "chilling effect" on his  First Amendment rights.  </P> <P> The suit was filed by the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith in New York  and the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala.  </P> <P> Stevie Remington, executive director of the Oregon ACLU, says her group  probably won't represent Metzger but might file a "friend of the court" brief  in his behalf.  </P> <P> Remington is chagrined that news of Metzger's request leaked to Portland's  Oregonian newspaper. She remembers how support for the ACLU nationwide dropped  after it represented Nazis in Skokie, Ill.  </P> <P> "We could take a hit again just like Skokie," Remington said. "But that  shouldn't deter us: our client is the First Amendment, not Mr. Metzger."  </P></p>

			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Fury over pit closures plan MINERS' LEADERS last night expressed fury over British Coal's plans to announce a sweeping programme of pit closures and job cuts as early as next week to clear the way for privatisation of the state-owned company. The National Union of Mineworkers called on Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, to resign and accused him of making inaccurate comments. A senior member of the moderate Union of Democratic Mineworkers called for a national strike to defend the industry. The government is determined to proceed with restructuring of British Coal although more than 25,000 jobs would be lost. An announcement next week would pre-empt the reconvening of parliament on October 19. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade secretary, said the announcement should not be made when ministers could not be called to account in parliament. Mr Heseltine refused to confirm the timing of the announcement, but told an interviewer: 'Everybody knows we are facing extremely difficult decisions.' According to documents leaked this month from the Trade and Industry Department, British Coal intends to shut 30 pits, with the closures announced 'in one go'. The NUM was angry about reports that Mr Heseltine had said decisions were being forced on the government because of the industry's lack of performance. Mr Frank Cave, the union's vice-president, said Mr Heseltine's comments were 'quite simply untrue'. He added: 'Either he is seeking deliberately to mislead the public or he is appallingly ignorant about the coal industry. In either case, those remarks on a question of such great importance raise serious doubts about his stewardship of the coal industry and he should resign.' The NUM said the closures would cost Pounds 2.1bn, a total of 50,000 jobs would be lost in related industries and unemployment benefit and lost taxation would cost Pounds 600m a year. Mr Neil Greaterex, Nottinghamshire president of the UDM, said: 'What we need is a general strike. It is not just miners' jobs at stake here.' The restructuring will add to the government's economic woes but Mr Heseltine believes shrinking British Coal to a commercially viable size remains the overriding objective. British Coal relies on artificially priced sale contracts to maintain its size. Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, has indicated he will press ahead with a coal privatisation bill even if new contracts, being negotiated with the electricity generators, are not agreed soon.</p>

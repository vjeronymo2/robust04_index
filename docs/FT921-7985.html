			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Survey of Contracted Business Services (6): Cost-cutting in the air - Travel Expenditure THE 1980s was the decade in which business travel got out of hand, says Mr Charles Parry, a senior London-based consultant with Arthur D. Little. 'It was the era in which the airlines competed with each other to pamper the business traveller, making him feel he was in first class when he wasn't, really,' he says. Frequent business travellers and travel agents agree that the last year has been a period of relative austerity. Company employees who need to travel to meet colleagues and customers are still doing so. But their organisations are paying much more attention to how much they spend on their air fares and hotels. During times of recession, companies frequently contract out services which were previously done in-house - from cleaning to security to data processing. Business travel is different because most organisations have always relied on outside travel agents to make arrangements for their employees. Only the largest organisations have tended to make their own travel bookings. What companies do during hard times is take a greater interest in the work of their travel agents, urging them to find cheaper airline and hotel bookings for their staff. Some insiders say that the real change in company attitudes was brought on by the Gulf War rather than by the recession. Senior company executives began to review employees' travel plans. Many started to think about the cost and purpose of business travel in a more systematic way than in the past. 'The Gulf War enabled companies to bring in some legitimate measures to control travel,' says Mr Clive Adkin, the director in charge of business travel at Thomas Cook. 'Nobody likes to have to toughen up travel policy. In a way, companies hid behind the Gulf War to gain control of travel and many have never gone back to the old ways.' Mr Parry, a frequent traveller, concurs. 'It was inevitable that at some stage companies would wake up to the fact that there were essential savings to be made.' The result has not been to stop business people travel- ling. The increasing volume of business many UK companies are doing in continental Europe means frequent travel is as important as ever. 'But what companies are trying to do is insist people travel economy rather than business class,' Mr Parry says. A recent survey by American Express confirms that companies have not abandoned business travel as a result of the Gulf War and the recession. The survey of 2,000 companies in Germany, France, the UK, Switzerland and the Netherlands revealed that spending on business travel and entertainment accounted for 5 to 6 per cent of total company costs and was rising faster than inflation. The average European expenditure per employee was about Dollars 2,000, compared to Dollars 2,121 in the US. Although companies are taking a greater interest in what their employees spend on travel, the survey showed that many organisations have yet to appoint senior executives to deal with the issue. Only 40 per cent of the European companies had appointed an executive to handle travel expenditure. Fewer than 60 per cent of the companies had a written policy document dealing with travel. However, a separate American Express survey of the UK appeared to reveal a determination to cut travel costs. Of the UK companies surveyed, 68 per cent were economising on business travel expenses. They were still allowing employees to travel but examining more carefully whether the trip was really necessary. The survey found that 43 per cent of the UK companies were reducing the number of trips taken by employees and 65 per cent were downgrading the class of travel and hotel.</p>

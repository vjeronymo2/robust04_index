			<p>BFN     [Text] The head of state, General Gnassingbe Eyadema, this  morning received Rwandan Planning Minister Augustin  Ngirabatware, who was accompanied by his Togolese counterpart,  Yandja Yentchabre. After the audience, the Rwandan emissary told  the media that he bore a message from Rwandan Interim President  Theodore Sindikubwabo to Togolese President General Gnassingbe  Eyadema on the current political and military situation in  Rwanda.    [Begin recording] [Ngirabatware] I have just been received  by  President Eyadema to whom I delivered a message from the Rwandan  president. Our discussions centered on the current political  and military situation in Rwanda. On 1 October 1990, Rwanda was  attacked from Uganda by an army composed of Rwandan refugees.  We later negotiated a cease-fire with them and signed the  Arusha peace agreements. On 6 April, President Habyarimana and  his Burundi counterpart were killed in a plane crash by the  Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] and its supporters. Since then,  the country has been in flames and the transitional government,  which was formed in accordance with the Rwandan Constitution, is  doing everything to stop the interethnic conflict.    The Rwandan Government's second ultimate objective is to  sign  a cease-fire agreement with the RPF as it is convinced that the  RPF can never seize power in Rwanda. The people do not support  it. The Rwandan Government is convinced that all sons and  daughters of Rwanda, both Hutus and Tutsis, must live together  on the national territory in peace. This is the subject of the  message I delivered to the president. I also answered President  Eyadema's questions on the possible restoration of peace in  Rwanda.    [Unidentified correspondent] On the military situation, what  exactly is happening in your country?    [Ngirabatware] The military situation is very, very  difficult  to describe because of the RPF's method of fighting. The  situation is really difficult to describe but on the whole the  Rwandan Armed Forces are in the process of controlling the city  of Kigali. RPF soldiers are scattered in pockets around Kigali  but according to the latest information, it is time for mopping  up operations. The RPF has made slight advances from the  Ugandan border to the southeastern part of the country where the  fighting is going on but the Rwandan Armed Forces are very alert.    [Correspondent] On the diplomatic level, taking current  initiatives into account, is there any hope for the rapid  restoration of peace in your country?    [Ngirabatware] Concerning hope, I, personally, am always  optimistic. Even if the recent interethnic conflicts in Rwanda  have scared me, I am, by nature, optimistic and I nourish the  hope that Rwanda can overcome this crisis.    On the diplomatic level, the Rwandan Government appeals to  all powers, both African and Western, to convince the RPF that  the cease-fire is an obligation and a necessity, because the RPF  does not care if human beings continue to die. Taking Rwanda's  political structure into account the RPF cannot, in any way,  seize power in Rwanda. The RPF is in the minority, but it is a  strong minority, a minority that the Hutu majority in Rwanda  must absolutely compose with. The two sides will certainly gain  nothing from constant war, so the government is doing everything  possible to ensure the implementation of a cease-fire. Of  course, as usual, the RPF is not showing any clear desire for  the implementation of this cease-fire but we will continue to  demand its implementation. [end recording]</p>

			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Burgers, booze and Bull: Guy de Jonquieres examines GrandMet's strategy and seeks common ground between its food and drinks divisions For much of the past seven years Grand Metropolitan, the large consumer products and services group, has insisted that it is no longer an unpredictable maverick and has acquired a clear and purposeful sense of direction. Its challenge now is to show that it knows not only where it wants to go, but how to get there. From next Wednesday, there will be a new pair of hands on the wheel. They belong to Mr George Bull, who moves from heading GrandMet's food division to become chief executive and heir apparent to Sir Allen Sheppard, the group's flamboyant and hyper-active chairman. Long an acquisitive conglomerate, GrandMet has re-shaped its operations since the mid-1980s. It has sold a string of mostly unrelated businesses including hotels, betting shops, brewing and much of its pubs estate. It has also entered new ones, notably by buying Pillsbury, the US food and restaurants company, for Dollars 5.8bn in 1988. Though the torrent of deals bewildered some observers, the group says that, unlike its previous wheeling and dealing, they were all part of a master plan. Its central objective is to become a tightly focused concern, dedicated to international leadership in branded food, drinks and retailing. Yet old ghosts continue to haunt GrandMet. For all its repeated statements that it is committed to a coherent strategy, Sir Allen admits that many investors remain uncomfortable. 'Just under the surface, they are still ill at ease,' he says. The choice of Mr Bull has been widely interpreted as a sign that GrandMet's board believes a change of management style - if not of corporate direction  -is needed. All the more so, since Mr Bull was promoted over Mr Ian Martin, the chief operating officer long considered favourite for the top job. Unlike Mr Martin, who has a reputation for abrasiveness and is best-known for his skill in reorganising troubled businesses, Mr Bull is a suave marketing man to his fingertips. A fruity-voiced old Etonian and former Guards officer, he affects an amiably bumbling manner, calling himself 'a simple drinks merchant'. The pose fools nobody who knows him well. In reality, he is respected as an astute, demanding and independent-minded manager, who inspires strong loyalty among staff. He also has an impressive record in building businesses  -not traditionally regarded as GrandMet's strongest suit. As chief executive and then chairman until last year of International Distillers &amp; Vintners, Grand Met's drinks division, he helped make the business the world's largest spirits company and the main engine of the group's growth. IDV's compound annual profits growth exceeded 20 per cent in the five years to 1992, when it contributed 56 per cent of GrandMet's total. Despite recession, it continues to churn out cash and is estimated to have raised profits by at least 10 per cent in the year to September. The 57-year-old Mr Bull strikes a more conservative tone than the group has sometimes done in the past. Shunning breathless rhetoric about global goals  -'I hate the word global' - he talks instead of a stepping-stone approach to international expansion. He is also said to be less preoccupied than Sir Allen with maximising short-term financial returns. His personal style is unusually austere by the standards of senior GrandMet executives. While the group's headquarters occupy a large and sumptuously furnished mansion in London's St James's Square, Mr Bull made a point of having his utilitarian quarters at IDV's Regents' Park offices re-decorated only infrequently. A strong believer in decentralised management, he has already set about chopping back an elaborate network of committees which sprang up under Mr Martin. 'George wants less interference from the centre. We are going back to the good old days when decisions were taken quickly,' says Mr John McGrath, chief executive of IDV. GrandMet is proud of its entrepreneurial culture, inherited from Sir Maxwell Joseph, the mercurial financier who founded it 31 years ago. Indeed, the group believes the freedom it gives managers is one of its greatest assets. 'We have a very strong history of being a bundle of energy, a get-up-and-go, doing company,' says Mr Bull. Like Sir Allen, he says GrandMet's competitive advantage is rooted in a proven set of marketing and brand-building skills, which can be transferred across frontiers and between businesses. Mr Bull, who has run GrandMet's food division since July last year, argues that its main businesses also operate in much the same market: 'All our consumers are identical. They all eat and drink added-value branded products. They are also international - they are the same consumers everywhere.' But these arguments do not convince everyone - and some wonder how firmly Mr Bull believes them. 'Much of the international branding strategy is hype,' says a former GrandMet executive. 'It grew out of a search for a credible concept which investors would buy, not from any deep-rooted corporate philosophy.' Even sceptics agree that the group has a talent for attracting and motivating able managers. But they also argue that its sometimes uneven past performance and history of free-wheeling individualism make it hard to be sure exactly what its enduring core skills are. Some executives also concede that food manufacturing and alcoholic drinks are much less alike than the company claims. Capital-intensive and directed largely at the mass market, the former business calls for management, marketing and distribution methods very different from the latter, which involves few fixed assets and is geared to luxury brands. The dissimilarities were further underscored last year, when a collapse in US fresh produce prices pole-axed profits at Green Giant, the processed vegetable business which is Pillsbury's biggest division. Nor is there much obvious strategic common ground between food manufacturing, drinks and Burger King, the fast food division, which is primarily a franchised service operator. To date, IDV, which has operations in 48 countries, is the only part of Grand Met to have achieved broad-based international success. The division, which is jealously protective of its operational autonomy, has increased its share of mature western markets by a blend of acquisitions, skilful marketing and aggressive product innovation. But though IDV believes its performance can continue to defy a steady decline in alcohol consumption in the west, reduced scope for acquisitions require it increasingly to look elsewhere for volume growth. Its prime target is eastern Europe, where opportunities - but also risks - are large. GrandMet's retailing record is more mixed. Burger King has been turned from a lame duck into a highly profitable growth business, thanks largely to the efforts of Mr Barry Gibbon, who has run it since it was acquired five years ago. By contrast, Pearle, the US eyewear chain which is the group's only pure retailing operation, has performed dismally. It is being extensively restructured in an effort to stem losses and is likely to be sold if a buyer can be found. But the acid test of GrandMet's strategy is its food business. Sir Allen says he still thinks it can be as successful internationally as IDV. But he concedes that GrandMet faces 'a hard slog'. 'We're very much a come-lately. It's a great pity we didn't begin our strategy a decade earlier,' he says. Pillsbury owns some long-established brands, and its efficiency and marketing have been sharpened up since it was acquired. However, the company is beset by price competition in US groceries, which it is seeking to offset by faster cost-cutting and new product development. Furthermore, Pillsbury is only medium-sized by food industry standards, with few sales outside North America. The markets in which it is strongest, such as chilled dough and processed vegetables, are also relatively mature. Mr Paul Walsh, its chief executive, says the company needs more growth businesses. Building up Pillsbury's position in North America must take priority over international expansion, he says, 'because if we miss a beat in the US, we won't have the cash flow to develop abroad.' So far, Pillsbury has been cautious about moving outside the US, concentrating principally on a handful of developing countries such as Mexico, China and South Africa. Its preferred method of market entry is through joint ventures with local partners, Mr Walsh says, because they require fewer management and financial resources than do wholly-owned operations. The boldest international foray has been by Haagen-Dazs, Pillsbury's premium ice cream brand. Expansion in Europe and Japan has helped double annual sales to about Dollars 500m in five years, and is the most striking advertisement of GrandMet's claims to expertise in taking food brands across frontiers. But Haagen-Dazs has yet to show a profit. Some observers, even inside GrandMet, also fear it may become vulnerable to more powerful competitors such as Unilever and Nestle, which both plan rival 'super-premium' ice cream brands. The liveliest debate, though, is what to do about Europe, where GrandMet is little more than a marginal player, with interests in baking, canning and food service. Efforts to turn Brossard, its cake subsidiary, into a Euro-brand have made little headway, and an exhaustive search for suitable merger or takeover candidates has yielded little. Some executives have begun to question whether it is worth persevering. They argue that Europe's economic prospects are so unexciting, its food markets so fragmented and local competition so well-entrenched, that the group should concentrate on Asia instead. Much may depend on acquisition opportunities. Sir Allen says mega-bids are 'less the flavour of the decade than in the 1980s', while Mr Bull is believed to be cautious about their virtues. But Sir Allen is also widely thought eager to make one more big takeover before he retires in early 1996. Whether GrandMet's balance sheet would allow that is another matter. Though gearing has fallen sharply since the late 1980s, it is still estimated at more than 50 per cent when the value of its acquired brands is included, and about 180 per cent without them. To afford a really juicy target, the group might need to make a big disposal. The only obvious candidate is Burger King. Some observers think GrandMet may in any case have to consider selling the business eventually if it is to mobilise the resources needed to become a serious world player in food manufacturing. Meanwhile, shareholders may need to wait longer to enjoy tangible rewards from GrandMet's much-trumpeted strategy. The group has forecast a 5 per cent increase in pre-tax profits before exceptional items for the full year, to be published on December 1, and says trading conditions remain tough. At 385p yesterday, its shares are well below their peak of 512p 18 months ago. Sir Allen is jauntily philosophical: 'One day, doors will open, clouds will roll back and our shares will be dramatically re-rated.' However, he adds: 'It will probably take a new chairman to make that change.'  ----------------------------------------------------------            GRANDMET: A MIXED BAG OF BUSINESS  ---------------------------------------------------------- Turnover from continuing operations: Pounds 7.045bn Profit before exceptional items and taxation: Pounds 871m  ---------------------------------------------------------- MAIN INTERESTS  ---------------------------------------------------------- International Distillers &amp; Vintners Sales: Pounds 2.86bn.

			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / International Company News: Tenneco income advances to Dollars 33m TENNECO, the US conglomerate in the throes of a restructuring, yesterday reported a Dollars 32m improvement in first-quarter net income. It also announced the loss of 2,250 jobs in Europe with the closure of three plants run by its troubled Case equipment subsidiary. The Houston-based company reported net income of Dollars 33m, or 20 cents a share, compared with Dollars 1m or a loss of 3 cents per share last year on revenues flat at Dollars 3.3bn. Operating income rose from Dollars 113m to Dollars 215m. The figures were a little ahead of most analysts' forecasts, but the shares dipped Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 43 1/2 . Mr Michael Walsh, the new president and chief executive, is pushing through a plan to restore the company to what he calls 'respectable levels of profitability' and sharply cut the debt on its balance sheet. The results included improved operating performances by all Tenneco's divisions, although Case, which makes agricultural and construction equipment, still lost Dollars 77m. That figure compares with a loss of Dollars 147m a year ago, when the subsidiary took a Dollars 32m charge for job cuts. Case, which has been hit by a downturn in its markets and excessive inventory levels, announced as part of its restructuring the closure of its plants in Carvin, France and Zaragoza, Spain. It would no longer manufacture high capacity excavators made at Carvin and would source its wheel loaders and hydraulic cylinders made at Zaragoza. It said it had also sold selected assets of its Vibromax compaction equipment business and would close its plant in Dusseldorf, Germany, later this year. These actions, which will reduce its European plants from 12 to nine, form part of a previously announced two-year plan to cut Case's employment from 30,000 people at the end of 1990 to about 20,000 at the end of this year. Mr Walsh said Case had met its performance targets for the quarter but refused to be drawn on when it might return to profit or whether he might sell the business. Operating expenses were significantly lower, while the subsidiary's worldwide production dropped 25 per cent from a year ago and dealer inventories fell Dollars 900m.</p>

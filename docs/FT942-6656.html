			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: New insurer, same cover I live in a leasehold flat. Up to now, the landlord has insured the building with Commercial Union. Now, presumably because it is cheaper, he has suggested cover with the IGI Insurance Company Ltd, of which I have never heard. Is it a reputable concern? The Association of British Insurers says IGI is part of the ACI UK Holdings insurance group and is an authorised British insurance company. You and your fellow lease-holders are, therefore, getting the same protection as you had with Commercial Union. As you say, no doubt the policy was transferred because of cost. (Answer by Murray Johnstone). CGT indexation factors The example accompanying the April CGT indexation factors on page IX of the Weekend FT last week may have confused some readers. It should have read: 'Suppose you bought some shares for Pounds 6,000 in September 1985 and sold them in April 1994 for Pounds 13,000. Multiplying the original cost by the September 1985 figure of 1.511 gives a total of Pounds 9,066.' No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

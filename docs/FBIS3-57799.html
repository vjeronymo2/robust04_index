In his New Year's message, President Konstandinos Karamanlis  stresses that it is about time that we all realize our mistakes  and search, with compromising procedures, for the national  policy which will get us out of the current impasse. Referring  to the situation in the Balkans, the president stresses that the  imprudent intervention of elements outside the Balkans is added  to the innate political and economic problems of the region.  The president notes that with their groundless and  inconsistent initiatives, these outside elements aggravate the  disputes among the peoples in the Balkans. The president said  that an example of the above is the continuing drama of  Bosnia-Herzegovina and the indirect encouragement of Skopje's  provocations against our country. In this unstable and  inconsistent world, the president notes, our country should live  and prosper. The president concluded: I believe that despite  the difficulties we are called upon to face, we will make the  new year the beginning of our country's exit from its current  impasse.    In his New Year's message, Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou  notes the broad crisis that marked 1993 at the national,  economic and social level by taking the country to the verge of  collapse. He stresses that this trend toward destruction was  interrupted with the election on 10 October and the triumph of  the Panhellenic Socialist Party. The prime minister notes that  for the Greek people, 1994 could be a year of greater hope and  feeling of security because today we have firm bases for  recovery, progress and development. The government and I, Prime  Minister Papandreou adds, are optimistic that with  responsibility, maturity and wisdom, with will, determination  and continuous dialogue with the social forums and the people,  we will proceed with the national reconstruction and productive  direction.</p>

			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Cricket boosts dish sales: FT SatellLte Monitor INTEREST in World Cup cricket led to a surge in satellite dish sales in March, taking the total of homes with satellite television to just under 2.4m - one in nine households, Raymond Snoddy writes. According to the FT Satellite Monitor, the number of new installations rose from 78,000 in February to 94,000 in March, taking the total to 2.372m. Mr John Clemens, chairman of Continental Research, the market research company that produces the monitor, said: 'Sports, and maybe getting away from over-exposure to election broadcasts, made March another remarkable month for dish sales.' There are 1m more dishes in place than 12 months ago and the number of people saying they would get satellite television is also increasing. A year ago, 1.4m homes had dishes and a further 2.1m people said they would definitely or probably install a dish. Now a further 2.2m are interested in satellite television, with 289,000 saying they definitely will get a dish and 1.88m saying they probably will.</p>

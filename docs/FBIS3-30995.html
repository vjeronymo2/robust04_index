			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Martin Bartisek asked Vladimir Meciar, Movement for  Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] chairman and prime minister, late  this morning to assess the situation brought about by  yesterday's publication of an alternative proposal by the  deputies and HZDS members.    [Bartisek] Ten members of the HZDS club of deputies to the  Slovakian National Council see a certain new solution to the  current crisis in an option to create a government of reason, a  so-called government of broad coalition. Mr. Prime Minister,  people from the HZDS, the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL],  the Christian Democratic Party [KDH], the Slovak National Party  [SNS], and the Alliance of Democrats are being considered for  this--however, without leading figures of those parties.    You will give your view on participating in the government  only following tomorrow's session of the HZDS caucus.  Nevertheless, could you give us your view now on this proposal?    [Meciar] There are two matters here. One concerns the  content of the proposal, and the other one is the way it came  about.    At yesterday's session, under the weight of evidence, Mr.  Roman Kovac and Jozef Moravcik finally admitted that, without  the knowledge of the Movement's political bodies, without the  knowledge of the government members, they had held talks with  opposition political parties about a different alternative  solution.    As they were not strong enough, they attempted to gain  support within the HZDS club, and, so far, they have been joined  by 10 deputies. This does not mean that all those 10 deputies  would vote against the government during a vote of no-confidence  in the government. Some of them would, and some would not.    The way they acted contradicts the principles of democracy,  it contradicts the HZDS's principles. It is immoral because,  during talks, they looked their colleagues straight in the eye,  pretending to be friends, and, in fact, they were working for  the fall of this government. They must assume political  responsibility for this.    The proposal itself assumes the following solution. The  first part is to remove political heads from the leadership.  This means the political heads of the HZDS and the SNS.  Logically, those others are not in the government. And we are  in the government not illegitimately but on the basis of  election results.    The second part is the formation of such a broad coalition.  What will be keeping them together besides material interests?  Nothing. This does not have any chance of surviving. Some  assume that elections might take place in a year's time--it is  not to be expected [passage indistinct]. They would settle  their personal, material, and group interests and then would  hand over the ransacked state to those who win the elections.    Third, it is the matter for the HZDS bodies to decide  whether  such a coalition would be viable. All its district congresses,  with the exception of one--and that was more a technical  matter--expressed their support for the government. This means  that, if deputies are taking such a stance, they are acting  against the resolutions of their district congresses, which are  binding for them. There is yet another factor here: The HZDS  did not express its interest in participating in any such  government. My personal view is not to participate in such a  government, not to participate in something that is being  prepared under the pretext of the government's reconstruction if  we want to have clean hands for the next elections.    [Bartisek] The Party of the Democratic Left admits the  possibility of a broad coalition. However, this has to be  discussed by the political entities concerned. We have learned  that, following your departure from Papiernicka [where HZDS  deputies held session] yesterday, you held a telephone  conversation with Mr. Weiss [SDL chairman], above all about the  amendment of the privatization law. However, a proposal was also  voiced about taking a vote of confidence in the government at  the same time. What is the reason for such a link?    [Meciar] This involves several things. First, this concerns  system measures in the sphere of privatization that are to be  implemented. Second, all of the opposition parties insist that  we do not enjoy support in the parliament. They criticize the  government and deprive the government of tools to carry out  economic policy. This is like someone giving you a job but  keeping the purse in his hands. This is nonsense. The  government is expected to take responsibility, but the tools of  responsibility are held by someone else. So, if they want to  cripple the government economically to prevent government  activities, let them to do it immediately. If the government  enjoys confidence, they should not deprive the government of  tools it can use in the sphere of politics.    Regarding the linking of confidence in the government to the  adoption of the law on privatization, no final decision on this  matter has been made so far--roughly 50 percent are in favor and  50 percent against. Let us wait until tomorrow to see the  decision made by the HZDS leadership.</p>

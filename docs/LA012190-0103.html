			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REMODELING: TIPS TO GETTING A GOOD CONTRACTOR  </P> <P> Many homeowners planning to remodel make a common mistake: They spend more time  gathering ideas for their remodeling project than checking out the contractor  they hire to do the work.  </P> <P> Because your home usually is your most valuable asset, make the best remodeling  investment by selecting a reliable contractor.  </P> <P> Keep in mind that remodeling is a service, not a product. It's easy to buy a  product. We can evaluate one item against a similar item, comparing price,  features, appearance, etc., before making our selection.  </P> <P> While remodeling a kitchen involves many different products, appliances and  materials, it is really a service. The remodeler is not offering you a kitchen  out of the box, direct from the manufacturer. He is offering the expertise,  experience and reputation to build a kitchen that meets your family's needs and  wants.  </P> <P> Finding a good remodeler requires diligent investigation before signing the  contract and handing over a check for the deposit.  </P> <P> You must decide, before price becomes a factor, that the remodeler has the  credentials to deliver the professional service you have a right to expect.  </P> <P> Here are some guidelines to follow in doing your homework:  </P> <P>  -- How long has the company been in business? It usually takes at least five  years to establish a financially sound business.  </P> <P>  -- Is the contractor licensed? Remodelers in California must have a general  contractor's license if they perform work (labor and/or material) valued at  $300 or more in any trade for which the Contractors State License Board  requires a license (such as electrical, plumbing, heating/air conditioning,  etc.).  </P> <P>  -- Does the contractor have a permanent business location and a phone where  you can reach him or her? Don't accept a business card as proof.  </P> <P>  -- Does your local consumer affairs agency, the California Contractors State  License Board or the Better Business Bureau have a record of unsolved  complaints against the company or the principal of the firm?  </P> <P>  -- Does the remodeler have proof of workmen's compensation and general  liability insurance? If not, you may be liable for any construction-related  accidents or damages on your premises.  </P> <P>  -- Will the contractor provide you with names of previous customers? Ask for  references of completed jobs similar to the one you are planning. If the  company specializes in decks, you probably don't want to hire them to do their  first room addition. Ask previous customers if they would hire the same  contractor again.  </P> <P>  -- Have you seen the contractor's work in person, both in progress and  completed? Check for quality of workmanship and materials.  </P> <P>  -- Are you able to communicate easily with the contractor? Misunderstandings  during a project can cause delays and cost overruns.  </P> <P>  -- Do you feel comfortable with the contractor? Remember, your family will be  in close contact with him and you will share your home with the crew until the  project is completed.  </P> <P>  -- Will the contractor provide you with a complete and clearly written  contract that you can understand (without needing an attorney to interpret it  for you)? See if the contract includes a written warranty that covers  workmanship and materials.  </P> <P>  -- Never overpay your contractor. Never advance your contractor more dollars  than the value of work he has performed. Pay only for work that has been  completed or materials that have been delivered.  </P> <P> This is a state law. Beware of a contractor who wants more than 10%, or $1,000  (whichever is less), as a down payment or one who asks for a larger draw than  the work completed to date.  </P> <P> Credentials that indicate a remodeler's reliability are membership in a trade  organization such as the Building Industry Assn. of Southern California  (BIA/SC), professional certification such as the certified graduate remodeler  (CGR) or certified kitchen designer (CKD), and an insured warranty such as the  home owners warranty (HOW), which covers the completed job up to five years  against construction defects and failures.  </P> <P> It might seem like a lot of work just to check out a remodeler, but doing your  homework pays off in the long run.  </P> <P> Dieckmeyer is president of the Remodelers Council of the Building Industry  Assn. of Southern California (BIA/SC). While readers' questions cannot be  answered individually, those of general interest will be addressed in this  column. Please send your remodeling questions to BIA/SC Remodelers Council,  1571 Beverly Blvd., Los Angeles, Calif. 90026.  </P> <P> </P> <P> NEW COLUMN Homeowners in greater Los Angeles spent almost $1 billion on  remodeling, home improvements and repairs in 1989. To meet the increasing  demand for consumer information on remodeling, the Real Estate section  introduces today a monthly remodeling column written by Jim Dieckmeyer, the  president of the Remodelers Council of the Building Industry Assn. of Southern  California. The column will address major topics of interest to homeowners  considering a minor or major remodeling project and will answer general  questions.  </P></p>

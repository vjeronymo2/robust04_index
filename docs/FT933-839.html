			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Attempts to reduce civil service staff levels fail: Rising crime and EC changes force up numbers GOVERNMENT efforts to reduce civil service numbers appear to be failing, according to figures to be published by the Treasury later this year. The figures show that most civil service departments have increased their payrolls in the last year, some by more than 5 per cent. Numbers released to the Commons Treasury and Civil Service committee show a slight increase in the number of staff in the civil service. The figures show 554,212 civil servants on April 1 1993, compared with 565,319 a year earlier, a fall of 11,107. However, 6,320 of this decrease is accounted for by the transfer of the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment into commercial management. Employees are no longer classified as civil servants. Another 5,100 staff left the civil service during the year as part of the privatisation of PSA services, the government's property services agency. If these two organisations are excluded from the comparison, the number of civil servants in the rest of the service has risen by just over 300 in the last year. In the previous year, the number rose by almost 11,500. The biggest increase was in the Department of Social Security, up 6,547 to 84,824 staff. The department said it could not explain the 8 per cent rise after three years in which staff numbers fell. Rising crime is a factor behind increases at departments connected with law and order, such as the Home Office, the Lord Chancellor's department and the Crown Prosecution Service. The Home Office said that many of the extra 1,631 staff on its payroll were employed in new prisons. There have also been increases in regulatory departments such as Oftel and Ofwat, and changes in the European Community's Common Agricultural Policy are blamed for temporary surges in staff at the Ministry of Agriculture and the Scottish Office. The rise in civil servants will almost certainly fuel calls for the government to tighten public spending controls. Several departments whose staff had increased in 1991-92 recorded falls last year. These include the Education and Environment departments and the Inland Revenue, which managed to cut more than 2,300 staff. The Institute of Directors is calling for a 5 per cent reduction in public service staff as a contribution towards cutting Pounds 20bn a year from government spending. Mr Quentin Davies, a Conservative backbencher on the Treasury and Civil Service Committee, said the figures showed that ministers needed to set targets for reducing the numbers of civil servants in their departments He said: 'At a time when the private sector has made unprecedented progress in increasing productivity, the civil service as a whole has actually maintained constant numbers.' Private pay rises 'set to reach 4 per cent', Page 11</p>

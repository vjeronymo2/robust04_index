			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Observer: Word perfect Spare a thought for Alex Ibru, who publishes the Guardian, Nigeria's leading newspaper. Its independent liberal stance has annoyed General Abacha's military regime and last week it was closed. This leaves the affable Ibru in an awkward spot since he doubles up as Nigeria's minister of the interior. It is not easy to resign from a military regime and there is not much point in trying to sell the Guardian as long as its presses are silent. Suggestions on a post-card, please, to Alex Ibru, c/o Guardian Newspapers, Rutam House, Lagos.</p>

			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Letter: No end to fundamentals of Swedish Model Sir, Robert Taylor's statement that 'popular support for the all-party agreement (in Sweden) suggests that the end of the old Swedish Model will not be a cause for national mourning' ('The ERM and Maastricht: Sweden unties welfare apron strings', September 23) cannot go unchallenged. The most striking aspects of the agreement are that it is a collective agreement which reflects consensus that all groups in society must share the costs of tackling the nation's economic problems. It is also striking that most Swedes lay the blame for the crisis at the feet of bankers whose activities in the 1980s have been followed by a banking crisis in the 1990s. These men (sic) are perceived to have been not only incompetent, but also immoral in their greedy pursuit of speculative wealth. The Swedish decision to pursue a collective solution to problems perceived to stem from individual greed hardly suggests an end to the most fundamental aspects of the Swedish model. Rather it suggests a decisive rejection of Thatcherite-Majorite policies of individualism based on political confrontation and economic and social polarisation.

			<p><P> February 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR AFFIRMATIVE ACTION, RICHMOND DECISION IS A DETOUR, NOT A DEAD END  </P> <P> The Supreme Court's action in striking down a program for minority business  contracts in Richmond, Va., has been called a disaster for affirmative action.  We disagree. The court did not prohibit affirmative action generally or  minority-business programs specifically. Rather, it spelled out steps that a  state or local government must follow to establish a bona fide program of  minority-business access to contracted work. The decision will not harm  affirmative action in the long run. In the short run, it will result in another  round of unnecessary hearings and litigation, and may very well discourage many  minorities and women from starting their own firms.  </P> <P> Minority-business enterprise programs, like other affirmative-action plans, are  voluntary efforts by public or private institutions that earmark benefits for  minorities or women. While often justified as a means of overcoming past  discrimination, they also serve the beneficial purpose of closing the divisive  gap between minorities and white males in our society. The Supreme Court has  upheld affirmative-action programs in cases involving private employment,  teacher hiring, state job promotion and university admissions -- the latter in  part because students learn better in an environment of cultural diversity.  None of these rulings are called into question by the Richmond decision.  </P> <P> Government efforts in this area began with the Nixon Administration's effortsto  develop minority-owned business. Congress enacted a 10% minority set-aside  requirement for federally funded public-works contracts in 1977, which the  Supreme Court upheld in 1980. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger's majority opinion  cited congressional findings of disparities between the significant minority  population and the minuscule number of public contracts given to minority  firms, and held that race-conscious legislation was appropriate.  </P> <P> The minority-contract program in Richmond was modeled on the federal statute  affirmed in the 1980 decision. The Richmond City Council had relied on the  congressional findings of a national problem and did not hold hearings  specifically concerning Richmond. The only statistical evidence was in this  startling disparity: Minority contractors had received less than 1% of  Richmond's public contracts, although the population was more than half  minority.  </P> <P> The court's majority opinion, consistent with the approach of earlier  affirmative-action opinions, set forth formal steps that would result in a  valid set-aside program. While deferential to federal legislation, the court  announced that it would strictly scrutinize state and local programs. These  would survive strict scrutiny if there was a strong factual basis that the  program was needed and if the program was narrowly tailored.  </P> <P> The court found that in Richmond there was no proper evidence of local need for  the program. There was no statistical evidence of the availability of qualified  minority contractors or the number of minority firms that received subcontracts  from white prime city contractors. As to narrow tailoring, the lack of  statistical evidence of a shortfall between minority firms available and those  awarded subcontracts meant that there was no evidence of any fit between the  program's requirements and the conditions that gave rise to it.  </P> <P> The opinion, although formalistic, is unexceptional in light of the court's  earlier cases. The need for a proper factual predicate is not new or unique.  States and cities with such programs must now follow the decision and hold the  necessary hearings.  </P> <P> The decision's failing is more fundamental. The court ignores that the problem  Richmond addressed was not local, but national. As the Burger court recognized  in 1980, minorities and women throughout the nation have been excluded from the  construction industry for years. The Richmond program was only a local version  of the program upheld in 1980. It has long been recognized that state and local  governments have a role in enforcing national policies.  </P> <P> In the Richmond case the majority itself observed that Congress, under the 14th  Amendment, may authorize "state action that would be foreclosed to the states  acting alone." Richmond was not acting "alone"; the statute that the earlier  court upheld established a national policy in favor of programs to encourage  minority-business enterprise. Moreover, the city of Richmond, like almost every  other state or local government, operates programs with federal grants that  require conducting such programs alongside locally funded programs. Under the  court's overly strict analysis, these must be unnecessarily justified on a  local basis.  </P> <P> There is a way to avoid the cumbersome city-by-city, state-by-state proceedings  that the court now requires. Congress has ample authority (under the 14th  Amendment and the Commerce Clause) to permit states and localities to adopt  minority-business enterprise programs without the restrictions of the Richmond  decision. Congress should address the failure of the court to recognize the  national scope of the specific evil to which these programs are directed.  Congress should expressly declare that state and local governments are  empowered to establish minority-business enterprise programs on the same terms  as the federal government itself.  </P></p>

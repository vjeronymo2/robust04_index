			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / International Company News: Seagram splits stock and pays more on peak result SEAGRAM, the international drinks group, has notched up record sales and operating profits and plans a four-for-one share split and dividend increase. The quarterly dividend initially will be 14 US cents per share on the new split stock, up 12 per cent from the present level. On an annual basis Seagram will pay 56 cents a share, against the equivalent of 50 cents now. 'Economic conditions in many markets could be improved but we make decisions for the long term,' said Mr Edgar Bronfman, chairman and chief executive. 'We have enormous confidence in our brands and we will continue to invest and expand our business.' Sales for the year ended January 31 rose 3.6 per cent to Dollars 6.35bn and operating income before special items was up 7.3 per cent to Dollars 760m. After gains on asset disposals, operating income was Dollars 961m against Dollars 708m a year earlier. Including dividends from its 25 per cent interest in Dupont of the US, and including its share of Dupont's unremitted earnings, Seagram's final net profit was Dollars 727m, or Dollars 7.67 a share, down nearly 4 per cent from Dollars 756m, or Dollars 8.03, due to lower unremitted earnings from Dupont, which was severely hit by the recession in 1991. Seagram's spirits and wines group posted a 9.5 per cent gain in operating income, with higher margins and lower overheads. A strong performance in Asia and Latin America was offset by a fall in the US and the effects of a higher US dollar. Fourth-quarter final net profit was Dollars 197m, or Dollars 2.07 a share, against Dollars 175m, or Dollars 1.87, a year earlier. Revenues were Dollars 2.06bn against Dollars 1.93bn.</p>

			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Untried hands reach for global levers - David Dodwell assesses trade talks as time for agreement runs short NOT for the first time in the past six years, the plight of the Uruguay Round of talks on world trade liberalisation lies in inexperienced hands. Different this time, however, are the sheer number of untried hands - chief trade negotiators for both the European Community and the US have come into office within the past three weeks - and the very limited time for them to learn the ropes. Critical decisions which might grasp belated success, or damn the Uruguay Round to inconclusive and damaging drift, will be made within the next month. Mr Arthur Dunkel, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), said: 'We are critically short of time. We must conclude now, or risk drifting into the sands.' Officials in Geneva, who have overseen the past three months of progress towards an agreement that could add Dollars 300bn a year to world trade by the end of the century, were adamant this week that a settlement was within reach. Sir Leon Brittan, the EC's new trade commissioner, appears to agree. He plans top-level meetings for the next 10 days in Washington, Geneva, and at the Davos summit, aimed at an agreement. 'Every week we don't have an agreement costs the world dear in money and jobs,' he said early this week. But it is unclear that the new US administration shares this view - nor is there confidence in Washington that agreement is within grasp. Part of the problem is uncertainty over future US trade policies or priorities. Confusion has been compounded by the fact that Mr Mickey Kantor, the new US trade representative, was among the last officials appointed by President Bill Clinton. He remains in learning mode. None of Mr Kantor's deputies has yet been chosen, nor is it clear whether his authority will be unchallenged as 'Mr Trade'. Other senior members of the Clinton administration have indicated a close interest in trade policy. Lobbyists point out that Mrs Carla Hills, Mr Kantor's predecessor, took two years to stamp her authority on the brief. There is doubt over the priority being given by Mr Clinton to trade policy. He is strongly committed to put domestic political and economic issues first. It is uncertain what space there will be for the Uruguay Round in his programme for the first 100 days - particularly in that politicians and lobbyists abound in Washington who say the Bush administration had made unacceptable concessions, which should neither be endorsed nor extended. Even if trade attracts attention, completion of the North American Free Trade Agreement may take precedence, along with bilateral US trade relations with China and Japan, and sectoral issues such as trade in steel, motor vehicles, and timber. According to Mr Gary Hufbauer, at the Institute for International Economics in Washington, the critical question is: 'Will Mr Clinton allow the Uruguay Round to atrophy on his watch without one last try?' He argues that doing nothing 'is a decision in its own right - a strong decision for drift', and he predicts that there is very little time for the administration to pause. The president's 'fast-track' authority to present a take-it-or-leave-it trade package to Congress expires in March. Whether or not Mr Clinton opts for 'one last try' may depend on briefings from leading Bush trade negotiators such as Mr Jules Katz, Mr Warren Lavorel and Mr Rufus Yerxa, all temporarily in place until Mr Kantor's deputies have been chosen. Officials in Geneva remain convinced a success is possible. They say the settlement in December of the EC-US dispute over reform of farm trade, and progress made in the past six weeks on trade in services, and in tariff cuts on manufactured exports, have greatly reduced outstanding disputes. 'Countries clearly have the flexibility to do the deal, but they won't show their hands until they are certain we are playing the true end-game,' one senior Gatt official said. 'Then the trade-offs will fall into place simultaneously.' This is not to ignore that these last trade-offs involve pain and controversy. For the EC, binding open its audio-visual market, and commitment to reform of national telecommunications monopolies, will arouse fierce opposition, particularly in France. So will cuts in tariffs around the ailing electronics industry, and in non-ferrous metals, pulp and paper, and chemicals. For the US, a hard decision will be to offer deep cuts in the tariff protection given to the textiles industry, and to accept restraints on the use of unilateral sanctions against 'unfair' trade. It will need to back away from demands to re-open negotiations on anti-dumping rules. Most critical of all, Mr Clinton will need to resist pressure to introduce new issues - such as labour and environmental laws - since this would almost certainly lead to an avalanche of demands from other countries to reopen areas of concern to them. As a senior trade negotiator from Latin America pleaded: 'Let's finish what we set out to do in Punta del Este six years ago. We know there are other items of business that have emerged since then, but let's tackle those after.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                             SHARING THE PAIN  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Where the US and EC concessions will be needed  ----------------------------------------------------------------------              US                                 EC  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Services     Maritime Services                  Audio visual services              Use of unilateral sanctions        Telecommunications  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Market       Bigger tariff cuts in              Bigger tariff cuts in access       *Textiles                          *electronics              *ceramics                          *non-ferrous metals              *glass products                    *paper and wood products  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Other        Opening up State government        Opening up government issues       procurement                        procurement              Rein in demands for              revision of draft Uruguay round    Consider sacrificing the              Drop demand for changes to         Multilateral Trade              anti-dumping text                  Organisation  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

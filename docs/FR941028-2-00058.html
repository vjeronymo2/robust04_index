			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> As provided in the October 9, 1991 municipal landfill rule, EPA's national Subtitle D standards took effect on October 9, 1993. Consequently, any remaining portions of the Federal Criteria that are not included in an approved State/Tribal program apply directly to the owner/operator without the flexibility that would be present in an approved State/Tribal program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has been approving and intends to continue approving State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs prior to the promulgation of STIR. EPA interprets the requirements for States or Tribes to develop ``adequate'' programs for permits or other forms of prior approval to impose several minimum requirements. First, each State/Tribe must have enforceable standards for new and existing MSWLFs that are technically comparable to EPA's revised MSWLF criteria. Next, the State/Tribe must have the authority to issue a permit or other notice of prior approval to all new and existing MSWLFs in its jurisdiction. The State/Tribe also must provide for public participation in permit issuance and enforcement as required in section 7004(b) of RCRA. Finally, EPA believes that the State/Tribe must show that it has sufficient compliance monitoring and enforcement authorities to take specific action against any owner or operator that fails to comply with an approved MSWLF program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA Regions will determine whether a State/Tribe has submitted an ``Adequate'' program based on the interpretation outlined above. EPA plans to provide more specific criteria for this evaluation when it proposes the State/Tribal Implementation Rule. EPA expects States/Tribes to meet all of these requirements for all elements of a MSWLF program before it gives full approval to a MSWLF program. Various components of authority and capability were submitted by New Jersey in its application for partial program approval, and the revisions and amendments thereto.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA also is requesting States/Tribes seeking partial program approval to provide a schedule for the submittal of all remaining portions of their MSWLF permit programs. EPA notes that it intends to propose to make submission of a schedule mandatory in STIR.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Not all States/Tribes will have existing permit programs through which they can ensure compliance with all provisions of the revised Federal Criteria. Were EPA to restrict a State/Tribe from submitting its application until it could ensure compliance with the entirety of 40 CFR part 258, many States/Tribes would need to postpone obtaining approval of their permit programs for a significant amount of time. This delay in determining the adequacy of the State/Tribal permit program while the State/Tribe revises its statutes or regulations could impose a substantial burden on owners and operators of landfills because the State/Tribe would be unable to exercise the flexibility available to States/Tribes with permit programs which have been approved as adequate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a State's/Tribe's regulations and statutes are amended to comply with the federal MSWLF landfill regulations, unapproved portions of a partially approved MSWLF permit program may be approved by the EPA. The State/Tribe may submit an amended application to EPA for review and an adequacy determination will be made using the same criteria as for the initial application. This adequacy determination will be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  summarizing the Agency's decision and the portion(s) of the State/Tribal MSWLF permit program affected and providing an opportunity to comment for a period of 30 days. The adequacy determination will become effective sixty (60) days following publication if no adverse comments are received. If EPA receives adverse comments on its adequacy determination, another  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice will be published either affirming or reversing the initial decision and responding to the public comments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> B. State of New Jersey  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On March 3, 1994, the State of New Jersey submitted an application for partial determination of adequacy of its solid waste landfill permit program. Certain revisions and amendments were submitted on July 21, 1994 and September 6, 1994. The application addressed all components of 40 CFR part 258 and discussed New Jersey's enforcement authority, provisions for citizen participation, and the current status of the universe of landfills within the State. EPA reviewed New Jersey's application and tentatively determined that the State's program meets all requirements necessary to qualify for a determination of partial approval of adequacy to ensure compliance with the Federal Criteria with the exception of Subpart E_Ground-Water Monitoring and Corrective Action. Upon appropriate adoption of revisions to its existing ground-water regulations, it is expected that New Jersey will become eligible for full approval which will include subpart E. On September 6, 1994, New Jersey provided a schedule as called for in its application, which indicates that all proposed regulatory revisions are expected to be adopted by October, 1995, at which time the revised regulations will be fully effective.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection has the responsibility for implementing and enforcing solid waste management regulations, including a permit program, inspection authority and enforcement activities. The State has determined that at present, 12 regional and 2 municipal sanitary landfills are subject to all components of the Federal Criteria. Twenty-two other existing sole source landfills as well as those landfills that closed prior to the effective date of the Federal Criteria, while not subject to the provisions of 40 CFR part 258, are still subject to the laws and regulations of the State of New Jersey, including those pertaining to closed and unpermitted landfills. New Jersey has identified a significant number of such sites, which may be classified as ``open dumps'' pursuant to 40 CFR part 257 and which are subject to regulation and enforcement by New Jersey under existing state law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To ensure compliance with all of the revised Federal Criteria, New Jersey needs to revise existing regulations concerning groundwater monitoring and corrective action so that the revised regulations are aligned with part 258, subpart E. As noted previously, New Jersey has submitted a schedule indicating that such regulatory revisions will be effective by October, 1995. To allow Jersey to begin exercising some of the flexibility allowed in States/Tribes with adequate permit programs, EPA is proposing to approve those portions of New Jersey's program that are ready for action today. These include criteria for location, operation, closure and post-closure care, and financial assurance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The public may submit written comments on EPA's tentative determination until December 14, 1994. Copies of New Jersey's application including revisions and amendments are available for inspection and copying at the location indicated in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  section of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / International Capital Markets: Loan for Oman fully subscribed A Dollars 300m sovereign loan syndication for Oman was more than 100 per cent subscribed, Reuter reports from Manama. Bankers described the response as a measure of the confidence bankers have in the oil producer. The arrangers for the five-year deal were Gulf International Bank, Chase Manhattan Bank, Commerzbank and Bank of Tokyo. As Oman was repaying debt, it created room for banks to take on new paper, a banker said. Japanese banks were said to be particularly interested in the deal, perhaps trying to re-establish their presence having taken a lower profile during the 1990 - 91 Gulf war.</p>

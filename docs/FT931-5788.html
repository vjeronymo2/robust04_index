			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Arts: Crazy for You - London Theatre I don't want to spoil anyone's pleasure, but large parts of Crazy for You struck me as absolutely dreadful: practically all the parts indeed that do not consist of songs and lyrics by George and Ira Gershwin. Since the songs are relatively few, that means that about two thirds of the show is dross. There is a supreme irony half way through the first act when Ruthie Henshall as Polly sings the wonderful 'Someone to Watch Over Me'. Ms Henshall sings well. Her voice can fill the very large Prince Edward Theatre. Some of the lines in that song, you may remember, go: 'Won't you tell him please, Put on some speed, Follow my lead.' How she can utter the words 'put on some speed' with a straight face is beyond me. For anything resembling speed in Mike Ockrent's production is conspicuously lacking. There are other gaps. Crazy for You does not have much of a plot, unless you count an excursion from New York to Deadrock, Nevada. It is rather thin on jokes. Only two stand out: the arrival of the founder of the Michelin Guide in Deadrock and the Deadrock citizen who, asked if he has any views on drama, suddenly begins a lecture on Chekhov and Stanivslaski. For the rest, the comedy is at the level of: 'I'm not down here to be insulted.' 'Oh, where do you usually go?' And 'Madame, if you don't like it here, I can show you the wide open spaces,' followed by the response, 'I have no desire to look inside your head'. The book is by Ken Ludwig, and there is an awful lot of it. Unless you are addicted to tapdancing, there is not much to be said for the choreography either. One ensemble song and dance scene relies heavily on men sliding down small sheets of corrugated tin and waving primitive saws. The same goes for the physical scenes without musical accompaniment. It is presented as a great feat that someone can fall downstairs without breaking a leg or prance about the stage with a chair on his head. This sort of thing belongs to Blackpool pier where it might be better done. I should add that Crazy is also entirely without characterisation. There is no Annie, no Eliza, no Henry Higgins, no band of brothers and sisters from the Salvation Army to stir it up. All the characters in Crazy seem equally flat and forgettable. That leaves the Gershwin songs and lyrics. No show that contains 'Embraceable You' and 'They Can't Take That Away From Me' as well as 'Someone to Watch Over Me' can be a complete disappointment. When Kirby Ward as Bobby sings of 'the way you wear your hat . . . the way we danced till three' and so on, he is quite as effective as Ms Henshall. Even here, however, there is something odd. Not all the songs are nearly as good. The rendering of 'Stiff Upper Lip', for example, is enthusiastic, but as a lyric or a tune it is not much of a piece of work. The biggest failing even with the best songs is that they are not integral to the show. They occur almost at random. Quite the best moment comes when two songs follow each other: Bobby's 'They Can't Take That Away From Me', immediately succeeded by Polly's short 'But Not For Me'. Such a rapid response happens only once. Otherwise, this is a ramshackle show punctuated by bad dialogue and people with silly voices. The sets are designed by Robert Wagner. One of them - of the Deadrock theatre - is well above average. For what is meant to be a spectacular show, the rest are undistinguished. A Rolls Royce appears on stage, chorus girls clamber out of it, but the standards of (say) the National Theatre when it comes to showing off have made us expect something more adventurous than that.

			<p>BFN     [Text] On Wednesday the State Duma faction Russia's Choice  and the unregistered deputies group Union of December 12 reached  a preliminary agreement to coordinate their activity on issues  submitted to the Federal Assembly's lower chamber for  discussion, Russia's Choice leader Yegor Gaydar reported to  Interfax. In his words, they have reached the same preliminary  agreement with the faction Yabloko.    Gaydar reported that during his meeting with the leader of  the Union of December 12 group Boris Fedorov and other members  of this deputies group they discussed the issue regarding  "creation of a coordinating mechanism which would allow to  coordinate their positions beforehand." The meeting of the  Russia's Choice faction scheduled for Thursday, to quote Gaydar,  will finally fix this agreement. Gaydar also pointed out that  the representatives of the Union of December 12 group again  raised the issue concerning rendering assistance to them with  people. This issue concerns that fact that the Union of  December 12 group needs six more people to be registered; now  there are 29 members in the group instead of 35 in accordance  with the State Duma's regulations. Gaydar believes that the  Russia's Choice meeting will find a positive resolution to this  issue.    Meanwhile, in his interview with Interfax leader of the  Union  of December 12, Fedorov, refuted Gaydar's assertion stating that  members of the group asked him to help in staffing the group.  "We raised the issue so that Russia's Choice did not hinder its  members who expressed their wish to join the Union of December  12 group by different means," stressed Fedorov.    Fedorov also pointed out that they had reached an agreement  with Russia's Choice "to jointly discuss the tactics on the  agenda of the State Duma "without any mutual obligations and  without creation of any blocs or coalitions." He reaffirmed  that such an agreement had been already reached with the Yabloko  faction.</p>

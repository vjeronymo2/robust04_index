			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Ruhe proposes scrapping EFA for cheaper jet THE German defence minister, Mr Volker Ruhe, yesterday proposed that the controversial European fighter aircraft (EFA) should be scrapped and replaced with a cheaper, lighter aircraft. His compromise plan to save money, and yet still provide jobs for the German aerospace industry and a European aircraft for the Luftwaffe, is likely to be put to the parties in the ruling coalition next week. The original plan for the coalition partners to decide for or against German participation in the multi-nation project yesterday was put back until June 30, apparently at the instigation of Chancellor Helmut Kohl. He is known to be concerned to reach a decision acceptable to Britain, Italy and Spain, the other participants, and to the Christian Social Union (CSU), the Bavaria-based conservative party which is his closest ally in the government. The idea of a cheaper, lighter aircraft was first mooted in press reports yesterday. It was greeted sceptically by the industry which saw it as a political face-saving measure rather than a serious technical proposal at this stage. Mr Ruhe's plan appears to be to use technology developed for the EFA, together with parts bought off-the-shelf from in some sort of modular-assembly concept. 'We are talking about a new aircraft,' Mr Ruhe said as he arrived to attend a parliamentary meeting of the Christian Democrats (CDU) and CSU. 'First there must be a decision to say no to production (of the EFA). That will open the way to using the development costs in the 1990s for a different European aircraft that would be considerably cheaper.' A spokesman for Deutsche Aerospace, the Daimler-Benz subsidiary which has a 33 per cent stake in the EFA project, said that any new aircraft would mean virtually 'going back to the drawing board'. British Aerospace has 33 per cent in the project, Italy's Alenia 21 per cent and Spain's CASA 13 per cent. Germany's opposition Social Democrats yesterday tabled a formal amendment to the constitution, which would in future allow German soldiers to serve in UN peace-keeping operations anywhere in the world. The move, which clearly excludes 'peace-making' operations like the Gulf War, is likely to be put to the vote in September, when it will require a two-thirds majority in parliament to take effect.</p>

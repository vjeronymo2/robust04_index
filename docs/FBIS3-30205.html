[passage  omitted].    Zhirinovskiy has, in the meantime, already rebuffed the  accusations of the Slovene authorities and said that he would  not leave our country early.    The Russian Foreign Ministry in Ljubljana [title as heard]  has stated that it would not get involved in the matter and our  authorities should, thus, treat the offenders against public  order in accordance with internal Slovene legislation and  international norms. They have also expressed belief in the  correctness of the incumbent Slovene organs regarding the  punishment of the Russian citizens.</p>

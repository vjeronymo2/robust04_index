The central organ of the Mongolian National Democratic Party  (MNDP) "ERH CHOLOO" puts the statement of the General Council of  the party on its pages.

The committee on ensuring order of the MNDP has taken a  decree on the necessity to improve the activities of the General  Council and other central bodies of the party reproving strictly  the leader of the party D. Ganbold and the General Secretary E.  Bat-Uul. Touching upon the visit paid by the Chairman of the  ruling Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party B. Dash-Yondon to  Japan the newspaper is wondering whether the Japanese side  decided to give political and moral support to this party.</p>

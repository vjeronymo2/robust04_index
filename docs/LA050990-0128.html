Kitsuta, a Newport Beach attorney who met last week with executives  from Japan's top companies in Tokyo and Osaka, said she noticed "a tremendous  interest in Orange County by Japanese companies" during her visit.  </P> <P> "They are extremely knowledgeable of the county, which to them is the new  Silicon Valley," she said.  </P> <P> Kitsuta said the Japanese executives were particularly interested in acquiring  or investing in companies in the biotechnology, supercomputer and semiconductor  fields.  </P> <P> And while Japanese companies' appetite for U.S. real estate has been dampened  by upheavals in Tokyo's financial markets and a weakening of the yen against  the dollar, Kitsuta said there remains strong interest in Orange County real  estate.  </P></p>

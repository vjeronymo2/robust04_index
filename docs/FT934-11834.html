			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Management: How to bend the chancellor's ear - There's still time to lobby the Treasury before next month's Budget. Peter Marsh looks at the best tactics In what no doubt made a pleasant change from poring over economic data, two UK Treasury officials flew to Scotland earlier this year for a day's tour of whisky distilleries. The visit was part of an orchestrated campaign by the Scotch Whisky Association to maintain contacts with the UK's economic policymaking department ahead of next month's Budget. Lobbying for the Budget is - as this anecdote illustrates - an around-the-year affair. None the less the next few weeks will see a particular flurry of contacts between the Treasury and the outside world as a range of groups attempt to bend the ear of Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, before he delivers his Budget strategy on November 30. Anyone hovering outside the department's London headquarters overlooking parliament next Tuesday will see people from an array of organisations trooping in to argue their case. On that day, for example, officials from the Brewers' Society (a trade group representing the beer industry), the Trades Union Congress and the Chamber of Shipping (which represents shipowners) are having sessions with Clarke. Ahead of the Budget - the first to cover tax policy and public spending - about 10 organisations have won a personal audience with the chancellor. On these occasions he sees people with a small group of important officials. Other groups pencilled into his diary include the Confederation of British Industry, the Institute of Directors and the Housebuilders Federation. At all these gatherings, the main aim of lobbyists is to convey the importance to the UK economy of a particular sector - with reasons why it should either be helped out by a particular dollop of special support (such as capital allowances for investment) or should be treated favourably in the area of tax policy. The importance of such meetings - a traditional feature of all UK Budgets - is questioned by some of the most experienced people in the lobbying businesses. Mark Boleat, who recently took over as director general of the Association of British Insurers after seven years as head of the Building Societies Association, says the importance of the sessions is 'over-rated'. He believes a prolonged period of contacts with the Treasury over a course of months or years is more likely to bear fruit. Among lobbying groups highly regarded within government circles - though this November they have not been given a date in Clarke's diary - are the British Film Institute, the Country Landowners Association and the British Road Federation. These organisations - and senior managers in companies tempted to act independently - should consider the following guidelines: Maintain contacts. Send in literature about your sector - and the policies you are advocating - to Treasury officials throughout the year. If you have a special reason to invite civil servants to your factories or offices - perhaps basing your case around the Treasury's new-found interest in sending its civil servants out of the office more to talk to industrialists - then follow the lead of the Scotch Whisky Association. If you have someone famous in your circle - the film institute in the past has been adept at introducing people at the Treasury to well-known actors - this might help your case. Understand the Treasury mind. One person who knows the department well says: 'I think of Treasury officials as stamp collectors. They are keen on collecting pieces of knowledge and arranging them in nice piles and feel fairly passionless about the result.' Bear this maxim in mind when producing the literature, which should be concise and not contain too many jazzy illustrations. Do not overdo the hospitality. Most Treasury officials are difficult to corrupt. On their visit to Scotland the two Treasury employees - with one Customs and Excise official - paid their own airfares and were given a far from lavish lunch. 'We wanted to illustrate the effect of whisky on the economy, not on the palate,' says Tony Tucker, the association's public relations manager. Use economic models. Hire outside economic consultants to work out what impact the tax or policy changes you are advocating will have on demand and supply. Even if Treasury officials do not agree with your reasoning, they will at least follow your arguments better on the grounds that many are comfortable with models. The Centre for Economics and Business Research, a London consultancy, has been used by the Chamber of Shipping to work out the likely effects of changes in the tax regime on the shipping industry. Try not to hypothesise a big drain of tax revenue from the Treasury. If there is one thing that will dissuade Treasury officials from a particular policy it is a large net negative stream of tax revenue - even if the policy actions you are advocating have the potential to deliver an overall economic boost. Therefore, always try in your economic reasoning to introduce some extra tax revenues for the government. This could, for instance, be in five years' time when the impact of a specific policy action - say a tax break for a specific sector which over a longer period will lift economic activity and so boost tax intake - has worked through. Target others apart from the Treasury. It is important to maintain contacts with MPs who can put pressure on ministers for policy changes and also cultivate journalists who might write stories with a favourable 'spin' which can help your cause.</p>

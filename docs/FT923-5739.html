			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Arts: Dreams from a Summer House Alan Ayckbourn the playwright reminds one of Ian Botham the cricketer. Their great days may be over, but they are not finished yet and they retain the capacity to surprise. This is Ayckbourn's 45th full-length play in just over 30 years. The surprise is that it is not really a play at all, but more a musical. Many of the familiar ingredients are there: the none-too-happy family, a well-off, but amiably stupid father, a mother who tends to lose her grip, a slightly manic child, mismatches all over the place. This is Leatherhead, Surrey, and a Home Counties summer party around the off-stage swimming pool. There is also a less wordly strand. The piece is woven into the story of Beauty and the Beast and, this being Ayckbourn, there is a twist. Both Belle the Beauty and Baldemar the Beast (a splendid hulk of a man played by Anthony Venditti) can communicate with ordinary mortals only by singing and if the mortals reply in kind. The start of the singing is the first surprise: the second is when it goes on. At first, it seems a good Ayckbourn joke. Well before the interval, however, we realise that this is quite an ambitious attempt at a musical in its own right. What begins as pastiche develops a style of its own. Not even the multi-talented Ayckbourn, who also directs, could write the music as well. This is provided by John Pattison who has long produced musical accompaniments for straight plays and now becomes at least an equal partner. It would need a better musical ear than mine to detect every musical allusion. South Pacific seems an initial and recurring theme, but that is not the tenth of it. Sondheim, whose Into the Woods also relied on fairytales, is there in the background. Yet one of the great pleasures of the evening is trying to pick out the rest of them. There is a touch of Don Giovanni and Rigoletto, Franz Lehar, Ivor Novello, Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber and Leonard Bernstein. The plot thins as the music goes on. Leatherhead diminishes into the distance and the Ayckbourn text, although he wrote the words for the songs, almost disappears. This is Ayckbourn having fun, and allowing others to do it for him, but it is still Ayckbourn exploring new uses for his Scarborough Theatre-in-the-Round. Whether Dreams would translate to the West End I doubt. It may be too slight and too musically precious for a larger stage. All the cast can sing, especially Jan Hartley as the Beauty.</p>

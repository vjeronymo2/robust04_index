			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS BRIEFS: WOULD LI'L ABNER FEEL AT HOME IN LAWNDALE?  </P> <P> In spite of warnings that it will turn Lawndale into the South Bay equivalent  of Dog Patch, Li'l Abner's hillbilly home town, the City Council has voted 3 to  2 to loosen city restrictions on front-yard parking, sending the ordinance to  the Planning Commission for review.  </P> <P> "This ordinance is an attack on every single person's property values in this  city," said Randy Brendia, who raised the specter of Dog Patch. Other  residents, including Steve Mino, have lobbied for an ordinance that would let  them widen their driveways to allow an extra parking space on the front lawn.  </P> <P> The city's present ban on front-yard parking was adopted in 1984. Planners  generally view the practice as an eyesore in residential neighborhoods, said  Mark Winogrond, a former Lawndale planning director who now heads the West  Hollywood Planning Department.  </P></p>

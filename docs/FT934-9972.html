			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / IBM replaces strategy chief IBM chairman Mr Lou Gerstner has replaced his chief strategist in a move that signals accelerated change at the world's largest computer company, as it struggles to regain profitability. Mr Jim Cannavino, IBM executive vice president and head of the personal computer business, will take the place of Mr Bernard Puckett, who had been appointed to the post of strategy director just four months ago, shortly after Mr Gerstner's arrival. IBM said that Mr Puckett was leaving the company after 26 years of service 'to explore opportunities to go into business for himself'. Analysts noted the IBM statement did not include the customary words of gratitude to a long-serving employee. Mr Cannavino describes himself as a 'change agent'. Colleagues say he is a 'strategist by nature', also known for his dislike of IBM's bureaucracy and his irreverent wit. 'When Gerstner joined us he thought there needed to be a lot of changes. I believe I can take some of his urgency and translate it into actions,' Mr Cannavino said yesterday. Mr Cannavino brings to the task 30 years' experience with IBM. He has restructured the personal computer business, which is making a strong comeback after losing ground to competitors for several years. Like Mr Gerstner, he does not favour the break-up of IBM. However, Mr Cannavino has strongly advocated change in the structure of the huge sales force. He has also pushed for IBM to use its Risc (Reduced Instruction Set Computing) microprocessor technology, currently employed in workstations, as the foundation for a new generation of products ranging from portable PCs to mainframes. Mr Cannavino will identify new directions and opportunities for IBM. 'We have areas of technology in which we don't currently have initiatives, areas that are not covered by any division, and I will have to figure out if they are going to be important to our company.' IBM must also make more of its technology resources, he said. 'We invented Risc but we didn't initially identify it as a market opportunity.' Mr Cannavino also acknowledges, however, that he must identify areas where investment can be cut.</p>

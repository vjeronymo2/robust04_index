Xiamen has, since reform and opening to the outside world  began 14 years ago, approved 2,400 foreign-funded items with a  total value of US$7 billion. Some 1,000 of the items were  invested by Taiwan businessmen involving US$2 billion while the  industrial output value of three-type foreign-funded enterprises  made up 61.2 percent of the total in the municipality.    With the scale of foreign capital introduced into Xiamen  growing rapidly, matters related to laws and regulations  emerging from economic activities, especially the investment  process, are tending to increase. The current laws and  regulations can no longer meet the needs of the adminstration of  foreign investment. Laws and regulations on bankruptcy,  settlement, notes, banking and mortgages have not yet come into  effect, resulting in an adverse impact on the administration of  enterprises and imposing direct obstacles to foreign investment.    Mr Huang pointed out that with economic exchange and trade  between Xiamen and Taiwan growing continuously, Taiwan  businessmen hope for the availability of a corresponding legal  environment to meet their business development. With regard to  laws and regulations involving Taiwan, much time is needed to  make legislation possible in the national legislature. The  setting-up of Taiwan-funded enterprises, settlement of disputes  and administration of these enterprises have long been had no  specific laws and regulations to govern them, causing many  difficulties to Taiwan- funded enterprises.    Mr Huang believes that the authorization of legislation  given  to Xiamen by the current NPC session will enable the  municipality to work out proper corresponding laws and  regulations of its own to meet the needs based on observation of  the Constitution and other relevant laws and regulations.  Backwardness in legislation seen in Xiamen can be improved  gradually and the municipality can move forward in promoting the  use of foreign and Taiwan capital.</p>

This was a proud event in which the chuche idea was declared  a great guiding idea of the socialist cause in the present time,  the author of a NODONG SINMUN article says.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is quoted as saying:    "...The idea, theory and method of chuche founded by the  great leader are the most correct ones for the guidance of the  building of socialism and communism in our time."    The article continues:    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il developed and enriched  the chuche idea with his energetic ideological and theoretical  activities, comprehensively reviewed the history of the  preceding revolutionary thought of the working class and  scientifically analysed the rich experience of the Korean  revolution and the historical lessons of the socialist movement.  On this basis, he formulated the chuche idea in an integral  system so that it could shine as the guiding idea of our time.    He proclaimed the programme of modelling the whole society  on  the chuche idea and made the chuche idea the flawless guiding  idea of the age of independence. This was a great event which  brought about a new turn in the development of socialist thought  and its cause.    This was also a historic milestone in heralding a new epoch  in the history of human thought and a historic turning point in  placing our socialism on a firmer ideological and theoretical  basis.    The proclamation of programme by Comrade Kim Chong-il is a  great exploit which makes it possible to successfully build  socialism on the basis of the chuche idea.    It is a programme of advancing the revolution with the  revolutionary idea of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, the  chuche idea, as the guiding principle and build and perfect  communist society on the basis of this idea. With this  programme declared, it was clarified for the first time in  history that the course of building socialism and communism is a  course of implementing the leader's revolutionary idea and  modelling the whole society on it.    In the history of the communist movement spanning one  hundred  and dozens of years, no party had ever raised the modelling of  the whole society on the leader's revolutionary idea as the  programme of building communism. This great revolutionary  programme could be propounded only by Comrade Kim Chong-il who  has a chuche outlook on the revolutionary cause of the working  class and unfailing loyalty to the leader's cause.    Definite priority should be given to the remoulding of  people  in order to raise their consciousness of independence and  creative ingenuity and, on this basis, nature and society be  transformed. This is the true path of building communism  indicated by the chuche idea and that is what the modelling of  the whole society on the chuche idea means.    The programme of modelling the whole society on the chuche  idea is a most scientific programme clarifying the way of fully  realising the independence of the popular masses, the makers of  history, and an immortal revolutionary banner under which to  resolutely defend the socialist cause and bring it to  accomplishment under any circumstance.    The unity of our society in ideology and purpose on the  basis  of the chuche idea has been immensely strengthened, a true model  of socialism based on singlehearted unity been built, the  ages-old idea of the popular masses been put into reality and  their independent life been ensured through the transformation  of all spheres of social life as required by chuche. These are  great achievements made in the course of modelling the whole  society on the chuche idea.    The programme of modelling the whole society on the chuche  idea is a historical cause which can be successfully  accomplished only by Comrade Kim Chong-il who has intense  loyalty to the chuche cause, iron will and faith to carry out  the revolution with chuche-based ideas and theories and  clairvoyant wisdom and outstanding leadership ability.    He was the first in history to propound the perfect  revolutionary programme embodying the guiding idea of the time  and wisely guide the efforts to implement it, setting a  brilliant example of socialist construction. This is a great  and imperishable exploit of his for the people's cause of  independence.</p>

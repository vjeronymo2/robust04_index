			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Survey of Malaysia (16): Dr. Teh's rapid rise - Company profile: ENG hardware engineering CHINESE physician Teh Ah Ba set up ENG hardware engineering in 1974, with just MDollars 500 (Dollars 200). Last month, the ENG group was listed on the second board of the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange with a market capitalisation of around MDollars 120m. In less than 20 years, the group has established itself as one of Penang's leading computer components and precision engineering suppliers, employing 250 people in a MDollars 20m purpose-built factory. Penang's transformation may have been built on foreign investment, but ENG is typical of a growing breed of local companies that have flourished in the wake of the multi-nationals. 'In Malaysia, we are pioneers. If we see a challenge, we meet it,' says Alfred Teh, group executive director and son of the founder. But it is the scale of ENG's success that makes it unusual. Mr Teh believes that at least part of the reason for that has been his father's determination to prove that a physician can succeed as an industrialist. Teh Ah Ba still works in the medical profession today, although mostly on a charity basis. Manufacturing, not medicine, has long since been the elder Teh's main career. He saw his chance with the arrival in Penang of the multi-national semiconductor producers in the early 1970s. 'They provided the market for local producers. It was up to local producers to match up, in terms of investment and quality,' says Alfred Teh. 'That was our mission - man, method, money and market, that is what you need, and we had them.' In a climate of strong government encouragement of local sourcing, ENG began in a small way, by servicing the multinationals' needs for engineered spares and parts. But it quickly developed into something of a specialist as a vendor to the semiconductor industry, concentrating on high-tech strong carbine tooling and machining, and robotic automated systems. By the mid-1980s, 30 per cent of ENG's sales revenue was coming from direct exports: to Hyundai in Korea, Intel in the US and semiconductor assemblers in Singapore and Thailand. The next target was the disk drive industry. 'We were already meeting the challenges of high value added precision engineering, and were looking for further diversification. We also wanted to move from jobbing into manufacturing,' Alfred Teh says. 'We got our first break with Maxtor, of the US, which was assembling disk drives in Singapore, just an hour away. Then, Maxtor moved to Penang.' Maxtor was followed by other disk drive manufacturers and support industries, and ENG had broken into another market. Since then, it has gone on to become the largest producer of E blocks for disk drives in Malaysia, and one of the world's top 10 producers, supplying four of the six leading multi-national disk drive manufacturers. Growth in the group's sales over the last five years has left little room for doubt about the scale of this breakthrough. Turnover of MDollars 6.035m in 1988 had reached MDollars 17.736m by 1992. And with pre-tax profits in 1992 accounting for more than 40 per cent of turnover, and a 'pioneer' status exempting the group from corporate tax, the group's performance ahead of its listing was impressive. Alfred Teh places much of the credit for this success with the family ownership and style of management, which he says has acted as a strong binding force. 'But this is a capital-intensive industry. If we wish to develop as the local equivalent of a multi-national, we must look to the capital markets,' he says. Another consideration in ENG's decision to go public has been the political sensitivity attached to the domination of Malaysian business by the ethnic Chinese. 'As good local Malaysian corporate citizens, we want to comply with the government plans for the sharing of wealth. It is very fair that we should structure the company so that it can be shared by the local Malays,' he says. Locals are also uppermost in Alfred Teh's thoughts as he grapples with the labour shortage that has come with Penang's success. 'There is no denying that it is a problem,' he says. ENG's solution, at least for now, has been a greater commitment to training. 'Every human resources department must play its part when labour needs to be as skilled as it is here.' ENG recruits 20 school leavers a year as apprentice technicians, tending towards long-term contracts as a means of retaining staff. 'I think in this respect, as well, we are something of a role model for local industries,' he says. Although the group's main thrust to date has been as a vendor company to the electronics industry, its plans are for further diversification. Its sights are already set on the aerospace, automotive and telecommunications industries. 'Our strength from the beginning has been our ability to evolve,' says Alfred Teh. 'We have one of the best ranges of capital investment in Malaysia, as well as the design capabilities, for a whole range of micro-parts. All we need from elsewhere is the end-requirement.' Even that is an area where ENG sees scope for development. It makes no bones about its increasing involvement in initiating the development of products for its customers, and its longer term aims are to attract more professionals still, so that it can move into the higher-technology end of the market. 'The point is that we are no longer just selling technical services, we are selling our brains,' says Alfred Teh.</p>

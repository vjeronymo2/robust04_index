			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by State Councillor Li Tieying at cadre meeting of </F> the State Commission for Restructuring Economic System on 14  October 1993: "Opportunity, Understanding, Framework, and Work"]    [Text] Reviewing history, whether of the international or  domestic situation, today is conducive to China's development  and reform, and a rare historical opportunity. It is imperative  for us to understand and grasp actively, comprehensively, and  correctly, Comrade Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics, to seize the opportunity and accelerate  reform as well as development.    The issue of development today is in essence one of reform,  and an issue of what we should reform and how. A high growth  rate is brought along by reform, and only through reform will it  be possible for us to master the "high technology" of control  over the macroeconomy in high-rate economic operation.    Stability can only be relative; stability cannot be  sustained  for long without reform and development or by seeking stability  at the cost of reform and development; only social progress  brought along by reform and development is the foundation of  stability.    To give full play to the initiative of the central  authorities as well as localities is the principle that we have  adhered to for a long time, as well as summation of historical  experiences. In the course of reform, we will not consider  taking the initiative in one aspect, while jeopardizing it in  the other.    In the present phase when reform enters the stage of  tackling  bottlenecks, should we overstress being gradual, sure and  steady, we will miss the opportunity. Generally speaking, the  basic way of pushing China's reform should be "making gradual  progress in entirety, with phased breakthroughs."    From breaking up the old strucuture to building the new,  from  dismantling the "old house" to setting up the "new building" it  is a process of the conversion from breaking up to setting up.  Setting up the "new building" of the socialist market economy  calls for meticulous design of the main pillars, and drawing the  blueprint of the whole framework.  <H3>  Seize the Opportunity, Accelerate Reform as Well as  Development </H3>   The Central Committee attaches great importance to seizing  the opportunity, accelerating reform as well as development. In  recent years, Comrade Xiaoping has on several occasions said:  "It is imperative to seize the opportunity; now is a good  opportunity. I am just worrying about losing the opportunity.  If we fail to seize the opportunity, then the opportunity before  us will be lost. Time waits for no one." "It seems that in our  development, we should seize the opportunity in a certain phase  and pursue high growth for several consecutive years." "Today  the world is undergoing a major turning point, it is precisely  an opportunity." His series of important remarks were made by  standing high and viewing far, and they are his understanding of  contemporary China as well as the world today. It is imperative  for us to deeply understand the spiritual essence of Comrade  Xiaoping's repeated emphasis on seizing the opportunity. The  general spirit of General Secretary Jiang Zemin's speech  delivered at the Central Party School last year, the important  topics at the 14th Party Congress, as well as the series of  important meetings convoked by the Central Committee and the  plans for reform presented, all spell seizing the opportunity,  accelerating reform as well as development.    Opportunity means precisely a specific period in which the  objective situation has provided us with the greatest number of  advantageous factors and conditions, which are most concentrated  at the same time. Reviewing history, deciding whether the  international or domestic situation today is conducive to  China's development and reform, and a rare historical  opportunity, it is imperative for us to lose no time in pushing  reform, accelerate conversion to the socialist market economic  structure, accelerate development and realize the second- and  third- step magnificent goals in realizing modernization.    Internationally, the world bipolar pattern has come to an  end, and it has entered the transition period of multipolar  development. Various forces in the international community are  undergoing disintegration and reorganization. Major Western  developed countries are facing many domestic problems, suffering  from economic recession, having enough trouble even in taking  care of themselves. There is the possibility for us to win a  comparatively long period of peace, while working hard to make  economic construction come up.    Toward the end of the 1980's, economic recession surfaced in  major Western industrial countries with a rising unemployment  rate, continuously shrinking saturated domestic market, and  growing surplus capital. Such a condition has inevitably led to  the pursuit of new international market and investment outlet.  Statistics show that world trade volume is $7,400 billion, and  China accounts for only 2 percent over, with very great  potential for development. Direct capital investment of various  countries overseas is already $2,000 billion; from now on, every  year will see a possible rise of $300 billion. That is  extremely helpful for China to expand opening up, utilizing  foreign funds, and technological imports.    Viewing the situation at home, Comrade Xiaoping's important  remarks made during his southern inspection tour last year  incisively analyzed the world and domestic situation,  scientifically summarized the basic practice and experiences of  reform and opening up, explicitly answered many important issues  that had perplexed and shackled people's thinking.  Consequently, the whole party and whole people have enjoyed  unprecedented unification in their ideological understanding.  We have Deng Xiaoping and other proletarian revolutionaries of  the older generation at the helm, as well as the correct  leadership of the leadership collective of the third generation  with Comrade Jiang Zemin at this core; we enjoy political  stability and sound social order, a high rate of economic  growth, and the people are living and working in peace and  contentment. Thus we possess a sound social and political  environment for further accelerating development.    The 15-year reform and opening up have enabled China to  double its economic strength, with people's living standards  improved by a wide margin. Between 1978 and 1992, China's GNP  increased by 2.33 times, with an average annual growth rate of 9  percent; financial revenue increased by 2.7 times, with an  average annual growth rate of 9.8 percent; overall popular  consumption increased 1.48 times, with an average annual growth  rate of 6.7 percent and 1.22 times for the non-peasant populace,  with an average annual growth rate of 5.9 percent; by the end of  last September, savings deposits of the urban and rural populace  were 1,390 billion yuan, in addition to cash in hand and other  financial assets in individual possession amounting to several  hundreds of billions of yuan; the industrial setup was tending  to become more rational, with the GNP proportion of tertiary  industry increasing by 5 percentage points; the proportion of  agriculture continued to drop, some 100 million people in the  agricultural work force have been transferred to  non-agricultural industries, with the degree of socialization in  agricultural production further upgraded. Over the past 15  years, we have genuinely taken the road that leads to  modernization. The great accomplishments scored in reform and  opening up have firmed people's determination to take the road  of the socialist market economy, with experiences accumulating  and large numbers of qualified people brought up. All this has  laid down a solid foundation for accelerating economic  development.    Since the beginning of this year, the national economy has  continued to sustain the momentum of vigorous development on the  basis of the high growth of last year. The series of measures  of macroeconomic regulation and control that the central  government has taken since last June are themselves a reform of  economic administration and measures to conduct macroeconomic  regulation and control with economic means. Marked results have  been scored since their implementation. While applying to  economic and legal means in the main, administrative means are  supplemented to conduct macroeconomic regulation and control;  this is necessary today, and also indispensable from a  long-range view. Any country that pursues a market economy may  conduct marcroeconomic regulation and control in various forms.    Some contradictions and problems have also surfaced in our  economic life today. Basically, their cause is the coexistence  of new and old structures, and backwardness and stagnation in  reform of the macroscopic control structure. This being the  case, the basic way to resolve these contradictions and problems  is in deepening reform and quickening the pace of building the  new socialist market economic structure.    Through long-term repeated fermentation, study, and  exploration, a number of the plans for reform of the banking,  finance and taxation, foreign trade and foreign exchange, and  investment structures, the enterprise, social insurance,  housing, and civil service systems, and the wage system of  administrative organizations and institutions have already been  presented, and more are to be presented soon. All these are  precisely reform of a deeper tier, and serve precisely to  basically resolve deep-tiered contradictions and problems we  have been talking about for years. With this as a sign,  economic restructuring in China has already entered a new phase  characterized by comprehensiveness, acceleration, and forming  into a whole range. To seize the opportunity means precisely  the need of a sense of pressure to quicken the pace in reform  and development to resolve deep-tiered contradictions and  problems as quickly as possible.    Opportunity is an objective thing and will not come about  through subjective wishful thinking. We lost several  opportunities for great development in the 1960's and 1970's;  consequently, our gap with developed and peripheral countries  widened. Today, history has once again endowed the Chinese  nation with an opportunity for great development. The  opportunity will be lost should we procrastinate. Comrade  Xiaoping has indicated: "By not being courageous to emancipate  the mind and give a free hand to one's work, the consequence can  only be the loss of opportunity, like a boat sailing against the  stream must forge ahead or it will be driven back." Every  comrade working in restructuring the economic system departments  must genuinely understand and firmly grasp this rare historical  opportunity, work hard, and live up to the mission entrusted to  him by the times.  <H3>  Correctly Understand and Handle Several Important Relations  in Reform and Development </H3>   To grasp the opportunity for deepening reform, it is  imperative to raise our ideological level and ability to  understand. This involves the imperative to understand and  grasp Comrade Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with  Chinese characteristics enthusiastically, comprehensively and  correctly. Only then will it be possible to grasp the overall  situation and orientation, learn to view things from a  dialectical view, guard against rigidity as well as onesided  views, while continuously make breakthroughs and progress in  theory and practice.  <H3>  The Issue of Emancipating the Mind and Seeking Truth From  Facts </H3>   Back in 1980, Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: "To emancipate  the mind means precisely that one's thinking must conform with  reality, making subjective thinking conform with the objective  situation, and seeking truth from facts." In addition, he  indicated: "From now on, to genuinely adhere to seeking truth  from facts, it is imperative to emancipate the mind."  Emancipating the mind, seeking truth from facts is our party's  persistent ideological line, and an invincible truth that has  been testified to by practice of many years in the revolution  and construction in China.    To adhere to emanciapting the mind, seeking truth from facts  is not an empty slogan, but a principle that guides our  practical work.    On the issue of development, it is precisely the need for a  sense of pressure, a firm grasp of the opportunity to accelerate  reform and development. All projects that have the conditions to  be accelereated should be developed with quicker pace, and those  projects that cannot be accelerated for the time being, should  have conditions actively created to gradually accelerate their  development. At the same time, it is imperative to respect the  objective law that governs things, act according to one's  abilities, while preventing great ups and downs in the economy  and great losses.    On the issue of reform, it is precisely necessary to combine  theory with practice. Without a ready pattern to follow in the  exploration of building the socialist market economic structure  in such a large country as China, we have to rely on ourselves  in practice. It is necessary to give a free hand to and be  courageous in practice; regarding those things that one is sure  of, they should be boldly experimented in blazing new trail. At  the same time, it is necessary to guard against major mistakes,  for things one is not sure of, experiments should be allowed.  Those which have been proved to be correct should be persisted  in, and those which have been proved to be wrong should be  corrected. It is necessary to respect the mass spirit of  initiative; at the same time, it is necessasry to earnestly  summarize experiences, and elevate successful experiences to  theory, while making them last through laws, decrees, and  regulations.    Regarding the issue of opening up, it is necessary to  emancipate the mind to boldly absorb and refer to all fruits of  civilization created in human society, including all advanced  operational and managerial methods that reflect laws governing  modern production in capitalist countries; at the same time, it  is necessary to proceed from China's national conditions to  embody the essential characteristics of socialism.    We should not study pure theoretical patterns deviating from  China's national condition and the practice of reform and  opening up; at the same time, we should refrain from regarding  some structural patterns of Western market economies as a  panacea for all diseases. China is a large country with a huge  population, and a cultural tradition of 5,000 years; the  development level of productive force and the market system is  comparatively low, with a comparatively great gap between its  urban and rural areas and an imbalance in regional development.  China is a socialist country, which is building modernization  as well as a socialst market economic structure. All these are  basic Chinese national conditions. To seek truth from facts, it  is certainly necessary to proceed from our national conditions  and build a socialist market economic strucutre with Chinese  characteristics.  <H5>  The Issue of Development, Reform, and Stability </H5>   On this issue, Comrade Xiaoping has made a series of  important statements.    Comrade Xiaoping said: "Development is the final word. [fa  zhan cai shi ying dao li 4099 1455 2088 2508 4289 6670 381]"  "What is socialism? What is Marxism? We did not have a  completely clear picture in our past understanding of these  issues. Marxism places the greatest importance on developing  productive forces. The essence of socialism is to emancipate  and develop productive forces." Of course, the development  Comrade Xiaoping referred to means the elevation of the  comprehensive national strength, in both quantity and quality,  "it does not mean encouraging an impratical high rate, but  paying attention to economic returns as well as steady,  harmonious development in a down-to-earth way."    In addition, Comrade Xiaoping indicated: "With the  establishment of the basic socialist system, it is necessary to  basically change the economic structure that impedes productive  force development to promote productive force development. This  is reform; therefore, reform also means developing productive  forces. In the past, we only talked about developing productive  forces under socialist conditions, saying nothing about  emancipating productive forces through reform, and that was  incomplete. We should talk about both emancipting and  developing productive forces."    The issue of development today is precisely one of reform in  essence and a question of what should be reformed and how. Only  by grasping the opportunity of reform will it be possible to  seize the opportunity of development. Without reform,  development will not be able to get rid of the bonds of the old  structure. Reform must aim at those deep-tiered contradictions  that impede healthy, high econonomic growth, and reforms that  cannot promote development are just fancy things and  undesirable. Practice has shown that wherever a good job is  done of reform faster development is enjoyed. Many problems  existing in present economic life were brought about by the old  structure. Under the situation of high growth, the old way is  sure to bring serious trouble. High growth is brought along by  reform, and only through reform will it be possible for us to  master the "high technology" of control over the macroeconomy in  a high growth rate economic operation. It is necessary for us  to learn the skill of qickening the pace of reform under a  situation of comparatively fast economic development and  comparatively tense economic relations. By no means should we  stop to pursue reform.    Regarding the relationship among development, reform, and  stability, Comrade Xiaoping indicated: "Through reform, it is  necessary to acquire conditions for long-term, sustained, and  stable development." "Reform certainly calls for a stable  political environment; nothing can be achieved by deviating from  this point."    Stability is the prerequisite for reform and development.  The great ups and downs in economic development, major  mistakes, reforms surpassing the bearing capacity of society,  enterprises and the people, and corruption will all jeopardize  stability. However, stability can only be relative. Stability  cannot be sustained for long without reform and development or  seeking stability at the cost of reform and development; only  social progress resulting from reform and development is the  foundation of stability. Only through reform will it be  possible to build the socialist market economic structure and  operational mechanisms as quickly as possible, and to insure and  promote sustained, high, and healthy economic growth. Only when  the economy is developed with the comprehensive national  strength augmented and people's living standards upgraded will  it be possible to insure the long-term and basic stability of  the country.  <H5>  The Issue of Planning and the Market </H5>   As for the issue of whether both planning and the market are  economic means, and socialism can pursue a market economy as  well, Comrade Xiaoping has made it very clear in his discussions.    The essence of the market economy is to achieve optimal  allocation of production essentials through the competition  mechanism characterized by elimination through selection and  pursuit of maximum interest. The efficiency of the market  economy in allocating resources has been evidenced by history.  However, behind market efficiency are market shortcomings;  regarding some social goals, such as fairness, public  undertakings, and environmental protection, it is not effective  to rely solely on the "invisible hand," namely, spontaneous  market regulation, which has some blind spots, and can hardly  insure the balance of economic general volume, resulting in  periodic economic crisis. This being the case, modern Western  countries have introduced government macroeconomic regulation  and control and social welfare policies into the market economy  and has greatly alleviated periodic economic crisis and class  confrontation. Restricted by the basic system, however, they  are unable to find a radical solution to the basic  contradictions of capitalism.    Practice has proved that modern market economy with  macroeconomic regulation and control is more efficient than the  traditional planned economy and a market economy taking its own  course. The socialist market economy stresses the basic role of  the market mechanism in resource allocation; at the same time,  it does not reject and give up the application of macroeconomic  regulation and control as well as planning means, while doing a  good job of applying the "visible hand." Under market economic  conditions, the chief functions of the government are:  Maintaining national unification and stability; conducting  macroeconomic regulation and control; conducting resource  allocation in non-competition arenas; and readjusting patterns  of social distribution.    Presently, some patterns in macroeconomic regulation and  control have already been shaped in Western countries, however,  they cannot provide us with a pattern to be copied intact. The  subject of macroeconomic regulation and control in Western  countries is the private ownership economy, whereas the subject  of macroeconomic regulation and control in China is mainly an  economy with public owernship as the main body. In our  macroeconomic regulation and control, we should pay attention to  doing a good job of protecting productive force, especially  promoting the structural readjustment of large and medium-sized  state-owned enterprises, by improving their economic returns,  development, and growth. We must proceed from China's national  conditions, consciously explore the building of basic  conditions, including positive, effective state macroeconomic  regulation and control institutions and a policy system, as well  as a whole range of national economic statistical index systems,  and a law and decree system, avoiding the surfacing of  disorderly phenomena in the course of developing the socialist  market economy and shortening the period of advancing toward the  modern market economy to create a new economic structure with  greater vitality and vigor.  <H3>  On the Issue of Economic Relations between the Central  Authorities and Localities </H3>   To give full play to the initiatives of both the central  authorities and localities is a principle that we have persisted  in for a long time, as well as the summation of historical  experiences. Initiative is precisely a productive force. To  suffocate initiative means precisely to jeopardize productive  forces. In the course of reform, we will not consider the  initiation of one aspect, while jeopardizing initiation of  another. In handling relations between the central authorities  and localities, the part must be subordinated to the whole, and  the whole should give considerations to the parts. Only when  the initiative of both are given play will the overall situation  be insured. If the proportion of the central financial revenue  is too low, central macroeconomic regulation and control would  be affected and weakened, the common development between regions  and social organizations could not be insured, and it would even  be difficult to cover necessary expenditures in state  administration and the normal operation of state organs. For  the unification of the state, social stability, and economic  development, minor truths must subordinated to the major one.  Of course, the vested interest of the part should also be given  full consideration.    To accelerate the reform of macroeconomic regulation and  control, we shall implement a standardized tax-sharing system;  that is not to return to the old path of excessive  centralization, not to negate the plural subjective aspects of  interest, nor does it mean forgetting about the initiative of  localities, but building the basic framework of the socialist  market economic structure in its macroscopic aspect. It  requires defining financial power on the basis of defining the  power of governments at various levels, and implementing a  standardized, scientific financial distribution system of the  central and local governments to promote the common economic  development in both eastern and western China. Our principle is  to allow some regions to become well off first, but not to slow  development in the eastern regions to narrow the gap between  east and west. Because the tax-sharing system is helpful in  breaking regional blockades and market separation, the coastal  areas where the market mechanism was built earlier with high  economic efficiency will acquire more interest through fair  competition in a unified, orderly large market. Whereas middle  and western regions may have greater opportunity for development  on the basis of augmenting central financial strength and  building a unified market system. Basically, of course, the  development of the middle and western regions should be realized  in market competition, by relying on their own efforts and  improvement in economic returns to gradually realize common  prosperity.    The building of a new macroeconomic regulation and control  structure will be helpful in giving play to the initiative of  various aspects. The central authorities may utilize financial  and monetary policies in a comprehensive way to regulate the  balance of the general social volume to insure sustained, high,  and healthy economic growth. All regions should compete with  and support each other to achieve common improvement and  prosperity.  <H5>  On the Issue of Fairness and Efficiency </H5>   Fairness and efficiency are ancient propositions in the  theory of economics. The majority of Western economists have  tried to study realistic economic operation and laws of  development to seek the greatest possible economic return under  private ownership without touching the capitalist economic  system as a prerequisite. Marxist political economics takes  production relations as its subject of study, and its basic aim  lies in developing the productive force to the maximum through  changing production relations and emancipating productive  forces. It is a misunderstanding to believe that Marxist  economics deals only the issue of social fairness. The  superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system  does not depend on moral criteria, but mainly finds expression  in its ability to create a higher productive force than  capitalism. Basically, the realization of social fairness and  common prosperity on the basis of high efficiency is the  essential definition of the socialist system.    It is imperative to adhere to the principle of giving  priority to efficiency while giving consideration to fairness.  Paying attention to development, material interests, market  allocation of resources, and advocating science and technology  being the primary productive force are all included in the  principle of giving prominence to efficiency.    It is necessary to stress the principle of giving priority  to  efficiency in primary distribution. Adherence to the principle  of distribution according to work, more work for more pay is  precisely the principle of giving priority to efficiency; it  embodies genuine fairness at the same time. The principle of  fairness is stressed in social redistribution; however,  efficiency should not be jeopardized by any means. Through  regulation of taxation, building of the social insurance system,  and other means of social redistribution, the government  resolves the excessive gap resulting from primary distribution,  and guards against polarization on the basis of insuring  efficiency top realize common prosperity.    In a certain sense, fairness is not only embodied in the  arena of distribution, but also in the opportunity and condition  for competition on an equal basis to achieve high efficiency  through such competition. This being the case, it is necessary  for us to work hard to build standardized market competition  order and regulations, so that efficiency and fairness may be  genuinely unified.  <H5>  On the Issue of Gradual Reform and Phased Breakthroughs </H5>   The development of productive forces is permanent, so is the  change in production relations. The way to push reform should  be determined by the needs of development. Development in  different stages and areas sets out different requirements on  reform; therefore, we should suit measures to local conditions  and the time, form, magnitude, and steps of pushing reform.    Experiences in 15-years of reform show that gradual reform  in  the market orientation has avoided the tremendous shock in the  socioeconomy that resulted from the "shock treatment" adopted by  the former USSR and East European countries, and is a successful  road that falls in line with China's national conditions. The  graduality of reform in its entirety was grounded on the fact  that we had no ready pattern to copy in theory and practice;  consequently, we must learn war through war. In development, we  have adhered to reform to promote development with reform, while  checking and testing reform with the results of development.  That is a basic experience in China's reform. However, when  reform has entered the present stage of tackling bottlenecks,  should graduality, being sure and steady be stressed  excessively, this would end in missing the opportunity,  artificially prolonging the transition period, and eventually  increasing the risk and cost of reform. This being the case, we  should adopt more enthusiastic and active principles, working  hard to gain substantial progress at every stage. Generally,  the fundamental way to push China's reform should be "making  gradual progress in entirety, with phased breakthroughs."    Regarding reforms that have a bearing on the macroscopic  tier of the overall situation, such as finance, taxation, and  banking and foreign exchange, it is imperative to have a unified  design and thorough-going implementation. Regarding some  reforms at microscopic tier, such as enterprise and housing  reform, they can be conducted in certain units on an  experimental basis to gain experiences and then spread at an  appropriate time. Regarding some reforms with ripe conditions,  larger strides and a quicker pace can be taken. The pace of  reform may be quickened in special economic zones, coastal  areas, and cities where experiments are conducted; they may take  the lead in building the new economic structure. Development  zone in various categories and newly-built projects should be  designed and operated based on the new structure from the very  start.    In reform, it is imperative to boldly blaze new trails, and  break through old structures, and at the same time acquire  rational standardization and build new structures.  Standardization is relative; in some cases, experiments can be  conducted first before standardization; in other cases,  standardization can be formulated first before implementation.  The mature, effective practices and experiences of countries  which have implemented the market economy for years, and which  embody socialized production and the general law governing the  market economy, can be taken for reference and direct absorption.  <H3>  Accelerate Building of the General Framework of the  Socialist Market Economic Structure </H3>   At the discussion meeting on economic work of 10 provinces  and regions of southcentral and southwestern China, Comrade  Jiang Zemin emphasized: "Building the new economic structure is  a great feat of socialist system engineering; it is imperative  to firmly grasp the formulation of the general framework." From  breaking down the old structure to building the new one, from  demolishing the "old house" to setting up the "new building," it  is a process of conversion from destruction to establishment.  Setting up the "new building" of the socialist market economic  structure involves the meticulous design of the pillars and  drawing the blueprint of the general framework.    At a meeting in May, I listed 10 aspects in the general  framework of the socialist market economic structure. Through  several months of study and exploration and hearing opinions  from various departments, we have further deepened our  understanding, and the contents are now somewhat readjusted.  Here, I should like to deal briefly with the main points.  <H5>  On the Ownership Structure </H5>   Our basic principle is to adhere to taking public ownership  as the main body, with the long-term coexistence, common  development, and equal competition of diversified economic  factors. Taking the public ownership as the main body is the  basic characteristic of the socialist economic system;  resolution of realization of the microscopic forms of the public  ownership economy under the condition of the market economy, as  well as the organic combination of the public ownership and the  market economy, are the most important topics in building the  new economic structure.    The core issues and difficulties in reform today do not lie  in the question of whether or not diversified economic factors  can develop, but in how state-owned enterprises can be developed  and strengthened. It is necessary to study how to do a good job  of managing state-owned enterprises, continuously strengthen  their vigor mainly through the channel of improving quality and  efficiency, and have them play the dominant role in fair market  competition. Of course, the development of a non-public  ownership economy has its own place and role; it is necessary to  augment guidance, supervision, and control while encouraging its  development.    State-owned assets should realize value preservation and  appreciation through readjustment, which precisely means  flowing. However, the flow of state-owned assets does not mean  loss. The readjustment and flow of state-owned assets are means  of appreciation; in other words, it is realizing optimal  allocation of resources under the working of the market  mechanism to endow the form of capital to state-owned assets.  With the flow and reorganization of assets, the number of  economic units with mixed ownership of assets will become  increasingly greater; inevitably, the ownership structure will  take on a new pattern. This is a trend that calls for our  sufficient attention.  <H5>  On the Building of Modern Enterprise System </H5>   Building a modern enterprise system is the enrichment and  development of the socialist market economic theory as well as  the foundation and key to building the new structure. This is  just the task for state-owned enterprises, and enterprises in  other categories should also work hard in this direction.    State-owned enterprises should have explicit ownership of  state- owned assets and a legal say in the disposal of  enterprise assets; on this basis, they should explore the  effective forms of realization according to different situation.  The company is the main form of modern enterprise system.  However, the modern enterprise system does not equate with  turning an enterprise into a company, or a share-holding  company, limited, or a listed share- holding company, limited.  The key to reorganization of the company system is reorganizing  those state-owned enterprises with mature conditions into  companies with limited responsibility or limited share-holding  companies according to the law, so that the enterprise many  genuinely become a legal person and vigor, operating on its own,  assuming sole responsibility for its profits and losses and the  subjective aspect in market competition. Regarding the small  number of enterprises that possess conditions, they can be  reorganized into listed limited share-holding companies through  strict examination and approval.    Presently, the key to the voluminous enterprises that do not  possess conditions to be reorganized into companies is to  implement the "Enterprise Law," "Rules and Regulations for  Industrial Enterprises of Ownership by All People To Convert  Operational Mechanisms," and "Rules and Regulations for  Financial Supervision and Control Over State-Owned Enterprises,"  work hard at converting enterprise operational mechanisms, find  specific ways of cutting back the historical and social burdens  of state-owned enterprises, and insure enterprise autonomy, as  well as the value preservation and appreciation of state-owned  assets.    In the wake of a state-owned enterprise realizing the modern  enterprise system, if it has genuinely converted its operational  mechanism, completed and perfected management, mastered high  technology, and enjoyed advantages in fierce world competition,  then that reform is successful. Of course, the enterprise  system does not have an ultimate pattern, and will be  continuously developed, completed, and perfected in practice.  <H3>  On Building a Unified, Open Market System of Orderly  Competition </H3>   Presently, the two-track price system for production  essentials remains and is a cause leading to non-standardized  economic operation and the rise of unhealthy tendencies and  phenomena of corruption. With the exception of some individual  varieties, control over prices for the overwhelming majority of  commodities, the labor force, and other production essentials  should be lifted to shape the mechanism of the market  determining prices. The task is still great to make the market  decide prices for production essentials.    To complete and perfect the market system, it is necessary  to  make nurturing a developed commodity market the base, with  developing production essentials market as the key. We should  gradually shape a unified and open-market pattern, which is  healthy and complete, which is characterized by the coexistence  of diversified economic factors, operational ways, and channels  of circulation, organically links wholesale and retail  businesses, and mutually accommodating domestic and foreign  trade. Presently, it is especially necessary to emphasize the  unification and opening up of the domestic market, oppose  separation and blockades, and build a unified, healthy, and  complete market competition order and a complete and perfect  market organizational and administrative system.  <H3>  On Converting Government Economic Administrative Functions  and Building the Macroeconomic Regulation and Control System </H3>   To build an effective macroeconomic regulation and control  system is to overcome the shortcomings of the market mechanism  itself and insure sustained, high, and healthy economic growth.  To do a good job of macroeconomic regulation and control, it is  necessary to correctly handle relations among planning, finance,  and banks so that they may work in a rational division of labor  and form a whole range in harmony, while restricting each other.  The main target of banks is to maintain a stable currency and  the control monetary supply; regarding finance, its main target  is to conduct readjustment in the economic as well as regional  structure and social distribution; with planning, its main  target is to formulate principles, policies, and strategic  planning for long and medium- range economic development, and  set out economic policies and means of comprehensive  application. The state should apply financial and monetary  policy in a comprehensive way, and guide as well as regulate the  large balance between the general volume of demand and supply.    While converting the government economic administrative  functions, it is imperative to reform government economic  administrative organizations; augment macroeconomic regulation,  control and supervise departments; intensify social  administrative functions; be determined to remove or merge  specialized economic administrative departments; build,  complete, and perfect the administrative system of state-owned  assets, as well as its operational system; and implement a civil  service system based on the principle of streamlining and high  efficiency. In addition, it is necessary to establish standards  in conformity with the needs of the market economy according to  law and complete and perfect intermediary organizations.  <H3>  On Building an Individual Income Distribution System Giving  Priority to Efficiency While Taking Fairness Into Consideration </H3>   It is necessary to adhere to the principle of distribution  according to work, with coexistence of diversified means of  distribution. Worker pay should be chiefly determined by market  competition, with implementation of the principle of more work  for more pay, and the wage gap appropriately widened; the  enterprise wage level and form should be chiefly determined by  labor productivity, economic returns, and the condition of  supply and demand on the labor employment market.    It is necessary to change the lack of standardization and  transparency in individual income resulting from distribution in  kind and subsidies from various departments and gradually  realize individual income in the form of banknotes. With market  economic development, pluralism in the ownership structure, and  the gradual increase in individual chattel, it is imperative to  study in depth the new conditions and problems arising from  production essentials entering individual income distribution.    Through the building of the tax regulation and social  insurance system and other means of social redistribution,  especially work in completing, perfecting and augmenting  collection of individual income tax, the individual income gap  will be narrowed to avoid the surfacing of polarization  resulting from the sharp difference in individual income while  taking the road of common prosperity.  <H5>  On Building the Socialist Insurance System </H5>   The key to the social security system is the establishment  of  the socialist insurance system, while shaping a whole range of  social relief and welfare, as well as arrangements for special  care to disabled servicemen and family members of revolutionary  martyrs and servicemen. Presently, the key is to build,  complete, and perfect pension and medical care insurance  systems. It is necessary gradually to increase the proportion  of individual payment through reform and implement the  combination of overall social planning and individual accounts.  It is necessary to determine the sources of social insurance  funds according to different types of social security to shape  into a sound circulation mechanism for the collection,  operation, and appreciation of the social insurance fund.  Attention should be paid to a relative balance in the social  security level, the productive force development, and bearing  capacity of various social and economic aspects; we should  refrain from pursuing high welfare levels. Presently, it is  necessary to unify the administrative structure of social  security and formulate unified policies according to the  principle of separating government and institutions, while  establishing multiform intermediary organizations and  realization of socialized service.    China's new urban housing system is one characterized by a  combination of market regulation and social security. It is  necessary to set up an accumulation fund and other forms of  savings for housing; an investment structure for housing  construction with expenses shared by the state, the unit, and  the individual; a commodity housing supply system with  high-income residents as subjects, as well as an economical,  practical housing supply system possessing the nature of social  security, with ordinary citizens as the subjects; a system of  transaction of housing property rights; and augmentation of  maintenance and management services after sales, and so forth.  Reform today should take the marketing of public-owned housing  as the key and accelerate the progress of turning housing into a  commodity. Social security and reform in the housing system  should start with state-owned enterprises, especially large and  medium-sized enterprises; the enterprise burden should be cut  back, while promoting the conversion of enterprise operational  mechanisms.  <H3>  On Building Foreign Economic Structures in Conformity With  International Usual Practice, in Active Participation With  International Competition, and Cooperation </H3>   The market economy is itself an open-type economy. With the  progress of reform and opening up, China will inevitably further  expand its link with the world economy. On the one hand, it is  necessary to utilize comparative advantages in the international  division of labor and international exchanges. In establishing  the new structure, we should promote the two-way dovetailing of  the domestic and world market. On the other hand, it is  necessary to see that mormal international practices are not  absolute, and the present-day normal international practice is  to the advantage of developed countries. Even so, the friction  in trade between developed countries remains very intense. It  is necessary for us to work hard to build a new world economic  order, pay attention to protecting national interests, and  promote economic development in opening up and world competition.    It is necessary to further reform the administrative  structure of foreign trade and exchange. We should develop a  large number of foreign trade companies which are  internationalized and standardized in behavior and combine  industry and trade, push large-type enterprise groups and  enterprises in townships and towns where conditions are ripe to  directly participate in world competition, and expand economic,  technological cooperation and ties in trade with all countries.  <H5>  On Deepening Rural Economic Restructuring </H5>   Presently, special attention should be paid to studying the  building of rural macroeconomic regulation and control system  and increasing peasant income. Macroeconomic regulation and  control of the general volume of farm produce will be conducted  through such means as a special grain reserve, grain risk fund,  finance for the implementation of rural policy, and control over  import of farm produce. It is necessary genuinely to increase  peasant income through reform and resolve the comparatively low  interest of agriculture. Several steps may be taken into  consideration, namely: First, readjust the rural industrial  setup by developing agriculture of high quality, yield, and  economic return; second, conduct operations of appropriate  scope, while allowing the inheritance and transfer of peasants'  contracted land use according to the law; third, develop  enterprises in townships and towns in a big way; fourth, adopt a  policy of protection, including state price protection for major  farm produce, protection of arable land, and environmental  protection; fifth, develop urban and rural labor employment  markets in a planned way to absorb the surplus rural labor  force; and sixth, accelerate building of small rural towns,  giving play to economic returns of scope and effects of  assembling. In addition, it is necessary to do a good job of  county-level comprehensive reform, and promote the progress of  urban and rural economic unification, as well as the overall  development in rural social, economic and cultural undertakings.  <H3>  On Building a New Structure for Social Development in  Undertakings in Science, Technology, Education, and Culture  Compatible with the Socialist Market Economy </H3>   Science and technology are primary productive forces; the  realization of modernization is ultimately determined by  improvement in the quality of the entire nation. Economic  competition in the 21st century focuses on scientific and  technological levels and the modernization of education.  Whoever masters high science and technology and high-quality  talents will win the initiative. The majority of research  institutes should directly serve economic construction and  establish a system of the economic legal person. In scientific  research institutes, results as well as scientists and  technicians that are able to enter the market should be open.  Division in the flow of qualified people should be implemented,  science and technology markets developed, and the unification of  science, technology, and the economy promoted. It is necessary  to regard education as the basic engineering of economic  development, while giving full play to the enthusiasm of society  running schools so that education may bring up more high-quality  qualified people for socialist modernization.  <H3>  On Building Completed and Perfect Legal System of the  Socialist Market Economy </H3>   The market economic structure is in essence an economy  characterized by the legal system. The change from the "rule of  man" to a legal system in economic administration is an  important sign of the establishment of the new structure. In  the course of building the new structure, a major task for the  government is to establish a complete and perfect system of  laws, decrees, and regulations to standardize the operation of  all economic arenas and links, the economic behavior of the  government, enterprises and individuals, and augment economic  supervision to realize the standardization and legalization of  economic relations, operation, and administration. We may put  it that the speed in establishing economic laws, decrees and  regulations has a direct bearing on the progress in building the  new structure.  <H3>  Augment Study, Elevate Our Political, Ideological,  Theoretical and Policy Level </H3>   By the end of the year, we are to mark the centenary of  Comrade Mao Zedong's birth. Volume 3 of the Selected  Works of Deng Xiaoping will also be published and  circulated. Comrade Deng Xiaoping is the chief architect of  socialist reform, opening up and modernization in China, and the  contemporary Marxist founder of the theory on building socialism  with Chinese characteristics. Comrade Jiang Zemin indicated  that the 14th Party Congress set out the strategic task to arm  the whole party with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory. This is  the pressing need of the great practice in pushing reform,  opening up, and socialist modernization, and basic insurance for  adhering to the party basic line for a century without wavering.  The three volumes of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping are a whole. The Volume 3 to be published soon  and Volume 2 published 10 years ago have collected the most  important works with the greatest originality of Comrade Deng  Xiaoping in the shaping and development of his theory. They are  rich in content, cover an extensive range of subjects with  incisive insight, filled with sharp spirit of the times and the  national spirit, and shine with the brilliance of the Marxist  truth. In studying volume three, it is imperative to earnestly  learn from Comrade Xiaoping in applying to the Marxist position,  viewpoints, and approaches, his scientific attitude, creative  spirit, and revolutionary style in studying new conditions to  resolve new problems. It is necessary to bring forward the  Marxist study style in a big way. Efforts should be made in  studying the original texts, working hard to achieve mastery  through comprehensive study, and grasping their spiritual  essence, and in combining theory and practice by linking them to  the current situation and tasks to improve the ability to  analyze and resolve problems. It is necessary to work hard at  unifying thinking by linking it to the experiences since reform  and opening up and the realities of one's thinking and work, to  summarize experiences and lessons, clarify muddleheaded ideas,  and guide one's practice with correct theory. The Third Plenary  Session of the 14th Central Committee to be convoked soon is to  adopt a "decision" on several issues on building the socialist  market economic structure. The "decision" is a programmatic  document to guide our reform work for several years to come  which also calls for efforts to do a good job of organizing its  study.    Sole reliance on zeal in pursuing reform is not enough; one  must work hard and be good at study. Practice, research,  summation, and reference all fall into the category of study.  The better one's study, the faster one's level will be  elevated, and the greater the results in one's work. Here, I  should like to set a requirement on you, namely, I hope that  every comrade will work hard to become an expert in some field  and keep in touch with a number of Chinese and foreign experts  in the same field. This way, the situation of our work will  certainly be greatly changed. It is impossible to enlighten  others with one's muddle-headedness. At the same time, one  should not always be ignorant, repeating what other people said.  For this reason, it is imperative for us to set up a complete  and perfect system for study and adhere to it.  <H3>  Change Work Method, Do a Good Job of Self Reform To Be  Compatible With Reform's Historical Change From "Destruction" to  "Establishment" </H3>   Comrades of restructuring the economy departments must be  modest and meticulous and good at cooperating with other  departments, and set out their plans and train of thought on the  basis of earnestly lending an ear and absorbing the opinions of  other departments. The cause of reform is one that concerns the  whole party and country, not just the affairs of one department  alone. We should offer help to each other, by no means should  we jeopardize each other in our relations with other departments.    We should attach importance to the formulation of plans for  reform. In the wake of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th  Central Committee, the Commission for Restructuring the Economy  should formulate more detailed planning for reform and present  its plans for implementation. In planning and the plan for  implementation, it is necessary to have a definite object in  view, with a very explicit goal and a whole-range of decrees and  regulations which can working. At the same time, it is  necessary to include in our work agenda plans for bringing up  cadres, specific regulations for implementation, and wide  ranging decrees before implementation, as well as possible  problems surfacing in the course of implementation. We are  "designers" but should also be good at being "engineers."    While formulating plans for reform, it is necessary to  augment work in policy research. We should watch closely and  analyze the actual conditions in economic life, think in line  with what is in the minds of leading comrades, and be anxious  about what leading comrades are anxious about, while making  proposals and suggestions of decisionmaking value. Key,  difficult points and hot spot issues and deeper-tier problems  are precisely those key points and hot spot issues to be studied  in our reform. For example, with the presentation of reforms in  banking, finance, and taxation, it is necessary for us to  earnestly study the possible further widening in the gap of  western region with its comparatively low competitiveness; the  question of how to resolve the social and historical burden of  large and medium-sized state-own enterprises; and the issue of  how to increase peasant income.    In building the socialist market economic structure, there  are many things that call on us to refer to the experiences of  Western market economies. One way is to make investigation  overseas; another way is to study from books. However, we  should always bear in mind China's national conditions. That  precisely means doing a good job of investigation and study,  analyzing where the crux lies, and writing research reports that  are of some weight, with deep insight and sound proposals. I  suggest that comrades more often go down to stay at the  grass-roots rural areas and enterprises to make friends with  more workers, peasants, intellectuals, and entrepreneurs, and  hear straight from them their opinions and suggestions.    We hope that various localities will attach importance to,  augment, and support work in restructuring the economy.  Comrades in restructuring the economy departments should also  accomplish something and do a good job of being the assistants  to leadership at various levels through their own hard work.  <H3>  Another Very Important Task for Restructuring the Economy  Departments Is Precisely To Augment Building of Rank and File,  Improve Their Qualities, and Improve Work Style </H3>   We should pay special attention to improving our own  political qualities. The aim of reform is to build the  socialist market economic structure. It is not enough to have  some general knowledge about the market economy, and it is  imperative to genuinely grasp the basic principle and essential  characteristics of socialism, and a comparatively high  cultivation of Marxist theory and political level.    Presently, it is necessary to implement earnestly the  central  decision to continue to push the anti-corruption struggle.  Comrades of the Commission for Restructuring the Economy must  exercise self- discipline on the one hand and block structural  loopholes that give rise to corruption through accelerating  reform.    It is necessary to further improve work style as well as  work  efficiency. We who are engaged in reforms must primarily have a  strong awareness of reform. We should not stop at formulating  plans for reforms and asking others to conduct reforms, but  should take the lead in reforming our own work, improve work and  work efficiency inside the Commission for Restructuring the  Economy in the spirit and courage of reform.    The cause of reform calls for a strong enterprising spirit,  and people with devotion. I believe that many comrades who are  determined to conduct reform are willing to work at  restructuring the economy departments and make contributions to  China's reform. I believe that many comrades of our  restructuring the economy departments will do a good job of  restructuring theeconomy. We should create conditions to absorb  a large number of fine qualified people with aspirations to work  in restructuring the economy departments.    Presently we are in a new historical period, and are  pursuing  the building of a socialist market economic structure, an  undertaking unprecedented in human history. Our task is  precisely to do a very good job. Comrades of the Commission for  Restructuring the Economy must emancipate their minds, brace up,  and work hard to accomplish something. I believe that under the  guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism  with Chinese characteristics and the leadership of the Central  Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, our cause of  reform will certainly be successful, and the magnificent goal of  modernization will certainly be realized.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Anna Melnikova, Yuriy </F> Sizov]    [Text] Moscow, 30 Apr -- Russia is not pursuing any  military aims or interests in Estonia, Russian President Boris  Yeltsin said in the Kremlin today while answering journalists'  questions after the signing of a package of Russian-Latvian  agreements.    Russia intends to withdraw all troops from Estonia, but we  want this to be done on a legal basis, as is already taking  place in Russia's mutual relations with Lithuania and Latvia,  Yeltsin stressed. In connection with this, he recalled that  Russia was strictly observing the accords reached in Germany,  and that Russian soldiers would leave this country by the end of  the year.    If the Estonian side shows goodwill, it will have full  consent from ours, Yeltsin said in conclusion.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aleksey Portanskiy: "Last Obstacle to Russia-EU </F> Agreement Removed"]    [Text] The announcement of the fact that President Boris  Yeltsin will be setting off 24 June for the Greek island of  Corfu to sign a partnership and cooperation agreement between  Russia and the EU was made to Russians with reference to the  Greek deputy foreign minister, who revealed the news in  Luxembourg Tuesday. The report was couched in the affirmative  -- not "intends to come," but "will come."    The most interesting point is that at the time of the Greek  deputy minister's speech nobody in the Russian leadership,  including delegation heads at the talks with the EU or even  Boris Nikolayevich himself, could officially state that the  Russian president would be flying to Corfu -- although  everything was headed in that direction.    There are indeed no points at issue in the text of the  partnership agreement, and intensive technical work to prepare  it for signing is currently under way.    The other day Boris Yeltsin voiced the intention to sign  this  important document, but only in the event of its being utterly  complete. I would recall that the Russian Federation president  was invited to sign this agreement a year ago in Copenhagen, but  the ceremony did not go ahead because we were dissatisfied with  the quality of the agreement.    Moscow is right to announce that Boris Yeltsin will be  flying  to sign the partnership agreement, at least after having  examined and confirmed the draft at a government session which  has not yet been held. Otherwise, we would have a situation  where EU ministers had held their own council of ministers  session, as arranged, and given the green light to the signing  of the document with Russia and would have automatically nodded  through a similar decision on Moscow's behalf -- even though, I  would repeat, Russia is striving to move to a new level of  relations with its West European partners no less than the EU is.    Also on Tuesday in Luxembourg President Leonid Kravchuk  signed the partnership agreement between Ukraine and the EU.  Ukraine has thus become the first CIS republic to sign such a  document with the EU, which is something to celebrate and to  sincerely congratulate our Commonwealth neighbors [sosedyam] on.    At the same time, this has allowed certain observers both  here and abroad to talk about some kind of advantageous position  for Kiev in obtaining a specific result in relations with West  Europe. In actual fact, although Russia-EU and Ukraine-EU  relations are similar, there are also some quite fundamental  differences between them.    From the economic standpoint Ukraine is still seen by the  countries of the "12" as the same as the former Union -- that  is, as a state with a centralized economy. On the contrary,  Russia is recognized as having the status of a country with a  transitional type of economy, which has rejected a  state-controlled trading system. The Ukrainian document does  not have a provision on trade in uranium, whereas in the Russian  document it has been a stumbling block in the final stage.    For the EU the last obstacle to an agreement with Russia is  being removed as a result of the signing by President Yeltsin  the other day of an edict restoring the rights of five West  European banks in Russia.</p>

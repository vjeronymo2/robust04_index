			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / International Company News: Singapore Aerospace to sell offshoots Singapore Aerospace said it planned to sell two wholly-owned subsidiaries to state-owned Singapore Technologies Venture for SDollars 52.7m (USDollars 35.6m), Reuter reports from Singapore. It said the sale of Singapore Aerospace Manufacturing (SAM) and California Avi-Tron Corp (CAT) would allow SAE and its subsidiaries to concentrate on aircraft maintenance and modification. Singapore-incorporated SAM began as a maker of military aircraft parts, but commercial aircraft parts now account for most of its turnover. CAT, incorporated in California, is a sub-contractor for sheet-metal products, including window frames, shrouds and plenums for Boeing aircraft. SAE said the aircraft industry had been hard hit by overcapacity and the global economic slowdown. The purchase of SAM and CAT will enable Singapore Technologies Venture to broaden its engineering base to support aero-parts manufacturing and other precision manufacturing.</p>

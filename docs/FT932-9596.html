			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Fowler fires salvo at PM's critics A FIERCE attack on the sniping at Mr John Major by the country's 'Patrician Tendency' was launched yesterday by Sir Norman Fowler, the Conservative party chairman. But in speeches to the Scottish Conservative party conference in Edinburgh both Sir Norman and Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, offered implicit acknowledgements that the government must provide a more coherent framework for its policies. Mr Clarke, who earlier this week admitted that the government was in a 'dreadful' hole, called on the Tories to re-assert a political agenda based on 'common sense, self-discipline and order'. Those values would ensure that the police and the courts could contain criminals and protect the public. They would underpin an approach in the social services and in education which would ensure that people were treated fairly but which also promoted self-discipline and respect. In foreign affairs they would guide a strategy designed to promote relations with the rest of Europe that promoted Britain's self-interest. Sir Norman, in a move designed to unite the party around the prime minister's leadership, accused many of his critics of being motivated by 'pure snobbery'. Referring to a recent newspaper article by Lord Rees-Mogg, he said the criticisms had 'symbolised everything that brought this country low in the years before 1979 - class division, prejudice and a wholly blinkered and outdated view of the world'. With some Tory MPs questioning the prime minister's style and authority, Sir Norman told the Scottish activists that Mr Major would lead the fight back after last week's defeats. Reminding the party that Mr Major had secured the party its 1992 general election victory against all predictions, he described him as 'robust, determined and unwavering'. Sir Norman acknowledged, however, that the message from last week's elections was that voters expected the government to deliver sustained economic recovery during the next 12 months. Its priority, therefore, was 'to make the economic recovery stronger, more widespread and more visible to all our people'. Offering a foretaste of one of the central themes of Mr Major's speech to the conference tomorrow, Sir Norman emphasised the new importance of manufacturing industry in the government's strategy. He told the party activists: 'We must be conscious in every decision government takes of the needs of industry, building on the success of the measures already taken'. Today, Mr Lang delivers his keynote address and Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, is expected to make a strong defence of government EC policy in the debate on Europe. Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, and Mr John McGregor, the transport secretary, will speak tomorrow.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 10 Apr (MENA)--A new round of  Palestinian-Israeli negotiations on the implementation of  autonomy in Gaza and Jericho resumed at noon today in Cairo.  The Palestinian side is chaired by Dr. Nabil Sha'th,  Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat's political adviser, and  Amnon Shahaq, Israeli deputy chief of staff.    Responsible Palestinian sources said that this round of  negotiations, which will continue until the day after tomorrow,  Tuesday, started with a closed meeting between the heads of the  Palestinian and the Israeli delegations to set the agenda for  the talks. Then, the meetings of the Security, Civilian, and  Legal Affairs Committees started.    Responsible Palestinian sources told MENA that the Security  Affairs Committee will mainly discuss a withdrawal schedule for  the Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip and Jericho region. It  will also discuss the agenda for the entry of the Palestinian  police force. The number of men in this force will range between  9,000 and 10,000 men. This was the reason for the breakdown of  the negotiations last week.    The same sources said that the Palestinian side proposed the  possibility of the Israeli forces' withdrawal during a period  ranging between seven days to less than two weeks starting from  the date the final agreement is signed.    The sources added that the two sides will also discuss a  number of other issues dealing with the security arrangements in  the autonomy areas, the security of the settlements, and issues  pertaining to the security zones around these settlements.  These are all issues that were not finalized during the  previous rounds of talks.    The Palestinian sources added that another issue under  discussion is the return of Palestinian deportees expelled by  the Israeli authorities after 1967 on the pretext that they were  carrying out actions hostile to the Israeli occupation. They  are estimated at around 2,200 deportees.    Israel has already taken back 200 deportees in several  groups  since the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles was  signed in Washington in September 1993. The Palestinian  negotiators are demanding the return of all deportees to their  homeland as soon as possible.    The Palestinian sources denied that the Palestinian and  Israeli negotiators have agreed on a timetable for the release  of Palestinian prisoners and detainees from Israeli jails,  estimated to number about 10,400 prisoners according to the  statistics of the International Committee of the Red Cross.  They also denied that the Palestinians have agreed to exclude  Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] detainees from the release  agreement. They affirmed that the PLO insists on the release of  all Palestinian detainees.    The Palestinian-Israeli Civilian Affairs Committee is due to  discuss in its meeting today the transfer of authorities,  services, and utilities to the Palestinian side. An important  issue under discussion is the transfer of authority over water  resources.    The Israelis have said that this issue was not discussed at  previous meetings because no Palestinian water experts were  present. The Palestinians and Israelis agree that considerable  progress has been made in the discussions of the Civilian  Affairs Committee over the past several rounds of talks, leaving  only a few minor points of disagreements. They pointed out,  however, that an overall agreement in the negotiations cannot be  attained until the two delegations sort out their security  differences.    The Palestinian sources pointed out that if no progress is  made in the current round of talks, seen to be revolving in a  vicious circle, then it will be imperative to hold a meeting of  high-level officials from both parties to remove the current  obstacles. Consequently, it is likely that a meeting will be  held in Cairo next Sunday [17 April] between PLO Executive  Committee member Mahmud 'Abbas "Abu-Mazin" and Israeli Foreign  Minister Shim'on Peres. It should be noted that Mahmud 'Abbas  is currently in Cairo, closely following the Palestinian-Israeli  negotiations while holding talks with Egyptian officials.  'Abbas held a lengthy meeting with the members of the  Palestinian delegation to agree on the negotiating method in the  current round of talks.    The Palestinian sources announced that the  Palestinian-Israeli Legal Affairs Committee, one of the  committees formed by the Gaza- Jericho meetings, will discuss  today the wording of the general agreement and the legal text of  the articles already agreed upon by the two delegations.</p>

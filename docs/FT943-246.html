			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Dealers warn on new-car figures The retail motor trade last night renewed its call for car manufacturers to stop inflating the new-car market by pre-registering cars for which there were no actual buyers, John Griffiths writes. Mr Derek Lindop, president of the Retail Motor Industry Federation, said that artificially boosting the market in order to keep production lines flowing was continuing to send the 'wrong signals' to government about the strength of the economic recovery. He told the institute's annual dinner, attended by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade secretary, that the practice of pre-registration - in which cars are later sold as 'used' but with only nominal mileage - was undermining the viability of the 7,000 franchised dealers. The year-on-year sales increase of nearly 10 per cent shown by the statistics greatly overstated underlying growth. This was closer to 4 per cent.</p>

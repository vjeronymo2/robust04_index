			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg April 23 SAPA -- The ANC on Saturday  [23 April] night welcomed Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] President  Mangosuthu Buthelezi's intervention into the conflict between  IFP supporters and ANC canvassers in Ulundi which killed at  least two people and injured several others. An ANC statement  said ANC President Nelson Mandela immediately contacted King  Goodwill Zwelithini who expressed his serious concern, saying  the events in Ulundi had deeply distressed him.    Mr Mandela also contacted Police Commissioner General Jan  der  Merwe who ordered more troops into the area.    "The continuation of political intolerance and daily murders  may not be tolerated any longer and all parties have a duty to  take decisive action to bring an immediate end to it," the  statement said.    The ANC demanded the IFP should "take immediate and strong  party disciplinary measures against any of their members who  were involved.    The role of the KwaZulu Police also needed to be  investigated  because of eye witness allegations that police failed to stop  the attack on ANC campaigners. The ANC urged the IEC  [Independent Electoral Commission] to investigate these  allegations.    It said it was crucial all necessary steps should be taken  to  ensure the freedom of all parties to campaign throughout Natal  and specifically in KwaZulu.    IEC Natal monitoring head Bheki Sibiya told SAPA it would  investigate the incident to see if the electoral code had been  breached. If there was a prima facie case against those who had  threatened the ANC and IEC members, the IEC would prosecute. The  other, preferred, alternative was mediation, Mr Sibiya said.    Clashes started after 17 ANC members, accompanied by  Independent Electoral Commission monitors, drove to Ulundi  around noon on Saturday to distribute election pamphlets and  canvass political support. Most of the canvassers were Congress  of South African Trade Union Members.    The IFP and ANC versions of events on Saturday afternoon  differed. While the IFP said ANC members opened fire on  residents, the ANC said its canvassers were attacked and their  two vans set alight.    Five ANC members fled and are still missing. Six others and  four IEC monitors took refuge in the Ulundi police station.  After about five hours, an armour-plated vehicle brought the ten  to safety in Eshowe.</p>

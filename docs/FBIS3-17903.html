This was reported by Vladimir Shumeyko,  the chamber's chairman. According to him, "the question of the  conflict between the Republics of North Ossetia and Ingushetia  is very acute in nature and violates that supreme human right --  the right to life."    Deputies instructed the Federation Council chairman to set  up  a special commission under the leadership of Ramazan Abdulatipov  for further study and consideration of this issue. After this  has been done, the commission is to submit its own proposals to  the president. Deputies intend to hold an enlarged session of  the Security Council with the special commission's participation  in order to make a final decision at the chamber's next session.    Vladimir Shumeyko stressed that many decisions had been made  before but none of them had been carried out. Therefore, he  stressed, it is "essential that all three branches of power --  the Federation Council, the president, and the government --  discuss this question and make a common decision."    The deputies present at the closed session adopted an appeal  to the peoples of Ingushetia and North Ossetia. The document  stresses the need for them to "lay down their arms and solve the  problems built up over many years by peaceful means."    Thus, three days of debate in the upper chamber of  parliament  on how to settle the conflict have essentially failed to yield a  constructive result. It has become clear to the participants in  the session of the upper chamber of parliament that to think  that the explosive situation in the North Caucasus will  stabilize of its own accord would be like trying to fall asleep  on a powder keg.</p>

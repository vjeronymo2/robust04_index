			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Property: A quiet revolution - One of the UK's richest landlords is changing its approach The row over rent increases at Smithfield market in London has put the spotlight on one of the country's richest landlords - the Corporation of London. The rumpus, which has arisen as a result of the need to meet the costs of upgrading hygiene standards to European Union requirements, brings into the public eye the corporation's eclectic property port-folio. Its holdings, which date back to medieval times, embrace about a quarter of the Square Mile in the City of London, along with extensive holdings in the West End and other parts of the capital. For example, the corporation owns New Bond Street, which was acquired in the 17th century as water-gathering lands. The pace of change in such a traditional and long-standing portfolio has, inevitably, been slow. But, according to Mr Peter Bennett, the corporation's deputy surveyor, the workings of the 500-year-old surveying department, which oversees the corporation's portfolio, has undergone 'dramatic change' over the past six years. The corporation's independence and deep pockets have helped insulate it from the ravages of the property collapse at the end of the 1980s. Nonetheless the corporation has moved away from its traditional style of estate management and adopted a tougher approach towards performance management. 'Over the past two years, we have been asking whether we are justified in having this much property. We analysed our portfolio in 1990 when we looked at every property and assessed its current and potential performance,' said Mr Bennett. Some properties were earmarked for sale because they were ill-suited to the portfolio or would require too much management effort. So far the corporation has sold about Pounds 10m of property. A few more properties are expected to be sold this year. However, Mr Bennett added, 'We are not flooding the market.' The corporation's investment properties are divided into three portfolios: the local authority portfolio, which is valued at between Pounds 150m and Pounds 200m. Much of this portfolio comprises second world war bomb-damaged property, principally around the London Wall area, which was bought post-1945 for redevelopment. Bridge House Estate, valued at between Pounds 150m and Pounds 200m. Revenue from these properties, many of which were bequeathed during the Middle Ages, are used to maintain City bridges: Tower, London, Southwark and Blackfriars. The corporation is appealing to parliament to change its constitution; this would enable the authority to use the fund for other purposes. A decision is expected within the next few months. City Estates, valued at between Pounds 300m and Pounds 400m. Revenues from this fund are used to replenish the corporation's private purse, which maintains Epping Forest, Hampstead Heath, the Port Health Authority, quarantine facilities at Heathrow, Guildhall School of Music, Barbican Centre and at Billingsgate and Smithfield markets. In many cases, the corporation merely owns freeholds while buildings are owned by leaseholders. In its City Estates portfolio, for instance, buildings represent between just 10 per cent and 15 per cent of the portfolio while the remainder is freehold. The corporation's concentration on freehold rather than leasehold interests has blunted the impact of recent market peaks and troughs on its portfolio. 'In a period of depression like the one we have been through, the effect of vacancies has been very limited,' said Mr Bennett. After peaking at 10 per cent, the corporation now said it had 'embarrassingly little' property to offer prospective tenants. The authority's ability to offer space at cheap rates has played a part in its recent marketing campaign to reinforce London's role as Europe's leading financial centre. It has been able to make space available in the City for representative offices, such as the Polish Business Centre which is based at the London Wall buildings. As demand for City property starts to pick up, the corporation is also dusting down its development programme. The programme tailed off during the recession, although the corporation has recently completed a Pounds 12m redevelopment of 1-7 Whittingdon Avenue and the rebuilding of Boston House on the corner of New Broad Street and Old Broad Street. The corporation is working on a Pounds 35m development of an art gallery in Guildhall Yard - a complex scheme, adjacent to listed buildings and positioned over remains of a Roman amphitheatre. Schemes currently on the drawing board include a project in Tottenham Court Road, where the corporation wants to build a 200,000 sq ft retail and office complex on the site currently occupied by a set of empty warehouses. The site has been owned by the corporation since 1574 when, as agricultural land, it generated Pounds 4 a year in rental income. The corporation is also considering developing two sites which it owns at Ludgate Hill, totalling 247,000 sq ft. The scheme may be delayed, however, because the proposed designs have not found favour with the Royal Fine Arts Commission. Archaeological investigations, which are likely to reveal important findings relating to the medieval City wall, are already under way. It is reluctant to expose itself to too much development risk. 'We will do developments where there is an opportunity to make a good return and where the size of the scheme is not too large. We do not want to over-expose ourselves,' said Mr Bennett. The authority prefers to find development partners as it did with the Little Britain scheme in Aldersgate Street, which was developed with Wimpey Property Holdings and Nippon Life; and at Alban Gate, which it developed in partnership with MEPC Developments. The corporation has put together a string of sites for which it wishes to find either buyers or development partners - and it has marketed these at exhibitions in Hong Kong and southern France. The task of selling development sites in the City is not made easier by the potential oversupply if developers acted on the large numbers of planning permits that have already been granted. However, Mr Bennett said that there is growing interest from developers. 'The key is to find the right product in the right location,' he says.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Victoria Macdonald, health correspondent: </F> "Children Suffer in Silence From Scourge of Asthma"]    [Text] The devastating impact of childhood asthma on  sufferers and their families and the high cost of its treatment  will be highlighted this week with the release of the largest  study of its kind into the disease.    It reveals that as many children are dying now of asthma as  they were a decade ago, despite the fact that figures for all  other causes of childhood deaths have fallen.    Half of all admissions of children to hospitals are caused  by  asthma, with the cost of childhood asthma to the NHS as much as  &pound;107 million a year.    The Lifestyle Study looked at 773 children with asthma, aged  between five and 17, and 248 parents. It is the first time the  impact of asthma has been studied on such a scale.    It found 2,482 children died from asthma in 1990, just 0.5  percent less than in 1980. Over the same time period, deaths  among children for "all causes" fell by 24 percent.    It is thought up to one million children aged between five  and 14 suffer from wheezing, with diagnosed asthma sufferers  accounting for one-third to a half of this total.    It is still unclear whether the incidence is rising but more  children are diagnosed with asthma every year. Some experts  blame increased pollution or maternal smoking.    Nick Wells, a pharmaceutical economist and one of the  authors  of the report to be published in the European Respiratory  Review this week, said it was hoped that the findings would  push the experts into doing something.    Mr. Wells and Dr. Warren Lenney, of the Royal Alexander  Hospital for Sick Children in Brighton, found 38 percent of the  school children in the study lost an average of 10 days a year  of education because of their asthma. More than half of the  parents whose children had more than five days' absence from  school felt their child's prospects were affected by the  condition.    Large numbers were also unable to take part in sport, play a  musical instrument or go out with friends. Two-fifths were not  allowed to take part in some trips or holidays.    The effect of asthma on parents is also considerable,  particularly on mothers. There may be additional housework to  reduce dust and other irritants and the need to take time off  work.    "The emotional impact on parents can also be considerable,"  the report says. "Feelings of guilt, worry or frustration are  often experienced." However, what also emerged was a sense of  "coping" among the parents, with 70 percent developing a routine  to deal with the illness.    The authors suggested NHS costs could be cut if there was  improved management of the disease in the community rather than  relying on hospitals.    They concluded: "No other paediatric problem has such  far-reaching consequences.    "It appears that both adults and children with asthma often  suffer in silence and it is only now the full impact of the  problem is beginning to be understood."</p>

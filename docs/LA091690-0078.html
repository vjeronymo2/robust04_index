			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WOULD A HANDGUN BAN REALLY HAVE AVERTED DANA POINT DEATH?  </P> <P> The most recent tragedy of the handgun shooting of an 18-year-old boy by a  16-year-old points up the urgency of the passage of the Brady Bill (H.R. 467),  which would require a seven-day cooling off period for handgun sales.  </P> <P> At present, this bill is seven votes short of passage in the House of  Representatives and needs voters to prompt its support by their congressmen  who, like ours, are still undecided.  </P> <P> The price for delay will be more innocent children killed in the crossfire.  </P> <P> GLENDA ROSEN  </P> <P> Dana Point  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOND'S FINANCIAL EMPIRE TEETERS ON BRINK  </P> <P> Australian entrepreneur Alan Bond, who captured the America's Cup seven years  ago, is fighting to prevent the collapse of his financially troubled brewing  and media empire, which is more than $5 billion in debt.  </P> <P> If the Bond empire collapses, it would be the biggest failure in Australian  corporate history.  </P> <P> As creditors demand that the company make delinquent payments, Bond Corp.  Holdings Ltd., is waging a legal battle to unseat a court-appointed receiver  and manager of its Australian brewing operations. The cash strapped Bond Corp.  is Australia's second-largest beer maker. It moved into the U.S. beer market  three years ago and has interests in G. Heileman Brewing Co. and Pittsburgh  Brewing Co.  </P> <P> Losing control of the brewing interests is the company's most worrisome problem  because it could trigger the default of other existing loans and cause other  creditors to protect their loans. That, in turn, could bring the house of Bond  down, according to company officials. Already, a group of U.S. investors, who  recently failed to receive a $32 million interest payment from Bond Corp., is  demanding immediate repayment of a $510 million in debentures issued by the  Australian brewery.  </P></p>

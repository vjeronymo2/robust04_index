"The foreign military force in our fatherland has been the  cause of conflict and permanent disturbance in our relations  with the United States, and I think we must not continue having  those bases," Munoz added. Munoz pointed out to LA ESTRELLA DE  PANAMA that the approximately 5,000 workers employed on the U.S.  military bases cannot decide on the economic future of the  country.    "The canal belongs to Panama," Munoz emphasized while adding  that the proximity of the date on which the United States will  return to Panama the waterway and the property that is needed  has led to "some sort of a race and fight to see who is going to  get part" of the same.    He criticized those persons who have asked at one time or  another for the military bases to stay and described this as "a  humiliation, a disillusion, and a shame." Munoz, 63, is a  lawyer and a pilot. His running mates are Rodrigo Bernal and  Julia Suira, as candidates for the first and second vice  presidency, respectively. According to the politician, the  renegotiation of bases "does not at all lessen the merits of  Panamanian nationality," but in order for that to occur the two  parties must be in agreement, after having vacated them under  equal conditions.

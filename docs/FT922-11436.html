			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / The Long View: Backwards to the future STOCK MARKET theorists have their thinking caps on. After all, the UK is now firmly established within the European Monetary System, and many uncertainties have been removed by the decisive general election result. It is an opportunity to plan ahead. So should British investors be making some fundamental adjustments to their strategy? They certainly need to consider the implications should European long-term interest rates remain for some years as high as they are now in real terms. In particular, must the relationship between equity and bond yields change? These questions, moreover, are not confined to the UK. Equity-oriented British investors believe that even if bonds do well equities will do even better, so why bother with bonds? That conventional wisdom has again been confirmed recently: since just before the election the UK equity market has risen by 9 per cent while long-dated gilts have climbed by about 5 per cent. However, the value relationship between gilts and equities is strained. With long gilts yielding some 9.1 per cent the crude yield gap between the two markets is now 4.4 per cent and the yield ratio is about 1.95. Already these numbers are at the lower edge of experience during the past 20 years. Equity salesmen argue hopefully that British shares are undervalued; but could we be about to emerge into an era of quite different relationships? There must be some kind of message in the high returns available on index-linked gilts. At 4.5 per cent it is currently high enough to satisfy the normal rate of return requirements of pension funds. Why buy equities on a dividend yield of only 4.7 per cent? You cannot reasonably expect to get a total return of more than about 6 per cent real on equities in the long run. A fascinating paper by Sushil Wadhwani of Goldman Sachs starts by posing the challenge of high real interest rates - a global rather than simply a British or European phenomenon - and asks whether stock markets internationally will have to fall sharply in order that the prospective real returns on equities can be jacked up. In Japan the answer has clearly been 'yes' and plenty of people are worried about the prospects for Wall Street on a dividend yield of under 3 per cent (though European valuations are generally less extreme). Internationally, real interest rates are 2 or 3 percentage points higher than the long-run 20th century average and if equity markets are forced to adjust there might be a 40 per cent tumble in share prices. In the event, Wadwhani uses elaborate arguments to come to the conclusion that this is very unlikely to happen, and it is more probable that share prices will in fact go modestly higher. He argues that in practice investors respond to nominal rather than real yields. Only if investors should wake up to real yields would there be serious trouble, he says. But here's a nasty thought: if inflation drops to zero, the real and nominal returns become the same, something which the dimmest investor could not overlook. Meantime Mark Cliffe and Chris Dillow of Nomura's London office have taken a closer look at the British situation. They point out that the yield gap quite quickly opened up 25 years ago from about nil to 4 or 5 per cent (just about what it is now) because sterling had become a weak currency, starting with the 1967 devaluation and continuing with the floating regime from 1971 onwards. In these conditions profits and dividends grew more strongly than before, making a wide yield gap logical. Now, however, we are effectively back in a fixed exchange rate framework; note that sterling in the past few days has been hoisted securely into the centre of the EMS grid. Profits could come under long-term pressure. In any case, one might add, British companies have been overdistributing: dividend growth has already slowed to 3 per cent over the past year, down from 18 per cent two years ago, and prospects are not good for at least the next year or two. We have already seen what has happened to investment property, where rentals have gone ex-growth and consequently prime commercial property now yields as much as gilts. What would happen if the yield gap closed and the equity yield had to match a gilt return of, say, 8 per cent (the rate on German bunds)? Why, British share prices would need to tumble by 40 per cent. If this analysis is right, British investors are making a serious mistake. They are looking backwards and are holding 1980s portfolios in the 1990s. With the All-Share Index this week poised to break through its all-time high of last September the fund managers whose portfolios are stuffed with equities scarcely seem to have a care in the world (although the seasonally aware will note that May, when shares traditionally reach their sell-by date, is getting rather close). Now, it is easy to pick holes in this kind of speculative modelling. We have no reason to believe, for example, that profits in the UK will be constrained in the 1990s as seriously as they were in the 1960s: unemployment is much higher, the unions much weaker and in the absence of exchange controls the return on capital cannot diverge greatly from international levels. My own view is that falls in interest rates and inflation may be enough to keep the UK stock market relatively firm for the time being. Wall Street will also get political support from a friendly Fed ahead of the November election. But 1993 could be very different, as cyclical factors turn unfavourable for the securities markets. A 40 per cent fall in share prices seems an extreme view. Yet if governments are determined to pump out bonds in vast quantities at real interest rates of 4 or 5 per cent, stock markets are bound to have a very tough time.</p>

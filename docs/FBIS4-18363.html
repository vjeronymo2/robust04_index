			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] Prosperity Party [PP] leader Necmettin Erbakan has  said that the only winner at the local elections was his party.  The people, he said, gave us the message to set up a just order  as soon as possible.    Addressing a mayors meeting organized by his party in  Ankara,  Erbakan stressed that the local elections closed one era and  opened the era of a just order, of the national view, and of the  PP. Turkey's showcase was handed over to us with the mayoral  positions we won in the big cities, he said, adding: We will  make Turkey a leading country.    Erbakan charged that upset by the elections results, certain  circles carried out various acts of provocation. He stressed  that the acts against women carried out in certain cities were  not the doing of the PP. He added that he sent a letter to the  Interior Ministry explaining the situation and demanding the  culprits be captured.    [Begin Erbakan recording] We are coming to save Turkey. We  are coming to bring happiness to 60 million people. Our path is  one of tolerance, brotherhood, and love. We do not bring bans.  We will not interfere with what people eat, drink, or wear. We  are coming to bring happiness to 60 million people. Mayoral  positions as well as government positions are places of service  to the 60 million. We do not discriminate among parties or  faiths. We consider every single member of our 60 million  strong nation a brother. [end recording]</p>

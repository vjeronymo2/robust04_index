			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Some of the exposure monitoring results showed personal samples above the new PEL of 0.1 f/cc. Union Carbide suggested, that employees performing Class I work using the modified negative pressure glove-bag, wear respiratory protection. OSHA is requiring that all employees who perform Class I work wear respirators.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additional data on negative pressure glove bags showing effective exposure reductions was submitted by others, including NIOSH (Ex. 1&hyph;125, 1&hyph;126). ``Opinion evidence'' was that negative pressure glove bags, when properly used, offered an additional margin of safety over non-negative pressure glove bags (see e.g., testimony of David Kirby, Tr. 188).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on these data, OSHA is allowing negative pressure glove bags for Class I work, subject to similar limitations as ``regular'' glove bags.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another method allowed for Class I work is the negative pressure glove box. This isolation device, is a rigid containment, unlike the glove bag, which is made of flexible material. Because it can be constructed of strong, impermeable material, common glove bag failures due to holes, leaks and collapse, would theoretically be avoided.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mark Mazzara of SDS International Builders submitted several documents describing a negative pressure glove box, which his firm was marketing. The accompanying brochures described it as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> *&blank;*&blank;*system allows for the removal of ACM on pipes by creating a closed work area around the pipe section to be worked on. *&blank;*&blank;* consists of work box, together with a pressure barrier generated by the systems inherent Negative Pressure filtration system. The Work Box is a maneuverable element of sturdy metal construction that is positioned around the unit of pipe to be worked on *&blank;*&blank;* [it] is fitted with standard gloved apertures allowing for access into the closed system for the asbestos workers. At the base of the Work Box is an aperture feeding into a bagging outlet into which the liberated ACM is passed. This allows for easy bagging of the ACM and its subsequent disposal. *&blank;*&blank;* [it] is attached to a *&blank;*&blank;* negative pressure generator, that allows the creation of the pressure barrier that allows the creation of the closed system, preventing the escape of hazards materials into surrounding area (Ex. 7&hyph;98). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> The submissions contained numerous sampling results indicating that low fiber levels were maintained during the use of this device. Accompanying these was a letter from the State of New Jersey in which the Division of Building and Construction (Frank J. Kuzniacki) stated that he felt that the device ``provided a safe and cost effective alternative to standard glove bag removal.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The last method specifically listed for Class I use is designated the ``water spray'' process. In submissions to the docket and in testimony at the public hearing, representatives of Hydrous Dust Control Systems, Inc. described an alternate method of control for use in work on asbestos covered pipes which they called the Portam Process. This process relies on water spray to provide a barrier between the worker and the ACM. In written materials it was described as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Engineered designed sprays are configured so as to create a liquid barrier on every plane. The spray is so designed as to throw a heavy droplet of liquid giving it both velocity and direction. On at least one of these planes *&blank;*&blank;* the heavy water droplets are forced into collision creating a very fine aerosol which is contained within liquid barriers. A water containment device is placed around the spray rails with an open access and double drain facility. A vacuum hose is connected to the drain facility creating a slight pressure differential (negative pressure), in the contained area. When water covers the drain area the pressure differential is maximized in the drain hose pulling the waste and water very rapidly to the remote interceptor. This movement creates a shock pulse which is quite visual and is reflected at the workhead. The sudden movement of air within the work zone helps to stimulated the fine aerosol droplets creating eddy current. These eddy currents promote a 360 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; precipitation around the pipe (Ex. 1&hyph;171). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Data were presented showing that use of this system achieved consistently low exposure levels. However, the complexity of the system, and its uniqueness require, as the manufacturer recommends, additional training for effective use. Therefore OSHA is allowing this system to be used only by workers who are trained in a supplemental 40 hour training course in the specific use of this system, including at least 8 hours of which must be hands-on training. Although BCTD stated that this system possessed a high potential for exposure because it is not a sealed system, (Ex. 143, at 103), OSHA believes that the technology of the water spray system is sufficiently proven by the data submitted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

An answer to this question has been sought in  the republic for 1 1/2 years. Precisely for such a time our  country, acquiring independence, has "twirled" the space  heritage of the former union, not being able to make up its mind  what to do. Not without hesitation was it decided to use it for  its direct purpose. In other words, such resources were  earmarked under the earlier signed Intergovernmental Program for  Space Research and Use, which Belarus decided to carry out  together with Russia, the Ukraine and other countries of the  Commonwealth.    Boris Beregov, deputy director of the Technical Cybernetics  Institute, Belarus Academy of Sciences, chairman of the republic  conference on space, states: Only at first glance does it seem  that getting out of the expensive space game means the saving of  money. Over the course of many decades a unique  scientific-industrial capability was formed in the republic  which was oriented on the development and production of space  systems, instruments and equipment for research on the Earth's  surface and atmosphere and the solution of other technological  and scientific problems related to the mastery of the universe.  To break up the formed infrastructure, to seek a new place for  application of the knowledge of specialists (most frequently  with a very narrow field of specialization) and to redirect  well-organized production to something else is possible only at  an enormous cost. An example of this is the Gomel Electronics  Plant. It is outfitted with the most modern equipment, including  a supercomputer, and has specialists of the highest class who  were brought together from the entire Union. Some mathematicians  brought about a hundred families from the Novosibirsk  Akademgorodok. And now they are mastering the production of  lamps and other consumer goods! The Novopolotskiy Izmeritel  plant, an enterprise which formerly was so secret and  extraterritorial that not many even in the government of Belarus  knew of its "space specialization," has found itself in a  similar situation. A reasonable owner must not think about how  to rid itself from what had been built up over the course of  many years, but how to use this wealth in order to bring it  income. Thank God we were able to convince the government of the  republic of this.    Just what is the nature of the contribution of Belarus to  the  intergovernmental program? The most important contribution is a  fractional participation in the funding of individual projects,  the sequence of which is embodied in a special agreement. Sums  will be allocated only for tasks to be performed by institutes,  design bureaus and industrial plants in Belarus.    In addition to sums taken from budget appropriations for  science, in accordance with the corresponding intergovernmental  agreement, for the Belorussian share for maintenance of  facilities in the space infrastructure, the government of  Belarus has allocated money from the Ministry of Finance  reserve. For this sum Belorussian standard-produced equipment  and materials will be supplied for ensuring the normal operation  of cosmodromes. Thus, jobs and production facilities will be  preserved.    The program for Belarus includes 32 themes which the  institutes and enterprises of the republic had begun to work on  (and in most cases have simply continued). It must be noted that  the program is being carried out jointly with the Russian Space  Agency and this is so-called peaceful space. The military people  have their own cooperation and their own plans.    With respect to Russia, it is interested in such a joining  of  efforts: for the development of such research it would require  not only additional appropriations, but also three or four years  for organizing corresponding scientific groups and bringing them  up to an acceptable level. Well, what is the interest of Belarus  in this? Is it only striving to preserve its space intellectual  and production capabilities or is it also counting on some  return?    "To be sure, we are counting on a return," explains Boris  Beregov. "It must not be forgotten that our republic is in a  more advantageous position because the principal financial  burden for space is not on our shoulders. Much of that which is  being done in the space field moreover is of a purely national  character and is directed to satisfaction of our own needs. In  addition, today possibilities are appearing for making formerly  secret technologies available to `nonspace' production  facilities, which also will bring an economic return.    In agriculture, for example, a space survey includes a  high-quality evaluation of the condition of soils and monitoring  of the fertilization of plants, as well as more successful  contending with weeds and predators and reproachless monitoring  of the development of sown crops and calculation of yields by  species.    Belarus has everything necessary for the processing of  satellite information. It is only necessary to organize this  work into a system. The first steps in this direction have  already been taken. But it is the opinion of scientists that  serious work will be possible only with the appearance of a  satellite information center and with the raising of this entire  service to a state level."</p>

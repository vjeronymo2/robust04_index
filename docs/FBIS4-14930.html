			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Business News Weekly" feature No. 14, 28 Mar-3 </F> Apr 94]    [Text] Since December 1993 NBU [National Bank of Ukraine]  has invariably succeeded in keeping its major pledge for  inflation monthly rates under 20 percent, NBU president Viktor  Yushchenko said at a press conference on 1 April, though, as he  had to admit the goal's attainment involved non-monetary moves  on the government's insistence, aimed at ruling out the  inflation effect of monetary emissions by the National Bank of  Ukraine.    Meanwhile, the inflation rate under 20 per cent a month  automatically makes NBU's refinancing rates (at 240 per cent  annual interest rate) positive, which Mr. Yushchenko considers  the most beneficial factor under the present circumstances.    As NBU vice-president Igor Mityukov noted, the bank's major  objective in the monetary regulation domain has been to create  the essential prerequisites for evolving a real currency market  in Ukraine, since presently this market is absolutely  centralized.    However, as Mr. Mityukov further noted, Ukraine's financial  structures were technically able to function in an absolutely  decentralized currency market environment back in August 1993.    Since then the government has taken a series of rigid  administrative moves tightening its grip on currency  regulations. These included, in particular, imposition of a  mandatory sale by exporter enterprises of 50 per cent of their  hard currency earnings at the NBU-fixed rates, as well as  suspended hard currency trading by the Interbank Currency  Exchange and the Ukrainian karbovanets fixed rate.    Despite inflation, NBU has to work under the fixed  karbovanets rate conditions, which results in multiple rates for  the Ukrainian karbovanets. Thus, to prop up the engineering,  coal-mining industries and agriculture their relevant ministries  will be allowed to purchase hard currency earned through exports  of their enterprises' products at the 30,000 krb.:1 USD rate  instead of the official rate of 12,610 krb.:1 USD.    Meanwhile, hard currency acquisition through tenders and  auctions (Ukraine's sole legal source of non-cash currency  purchases), will be allowed, same as before, only for purposes,  which the government's officers deign to consider as expedient  (purchasing fuels, timber, medicines, for instance).  <H5>  Relations with International Financial Institutions </H5>   Granting credits by the World Bank, IMF and other  international financial institutions involves Ukraine's strict  observance of certain commitments and requirements, primarily  its economic reform's efficacy.    In Mr. Mityukov's opinion, this agreement allows the West to  indefinitely and rather arbitrarily delay credit granting to  Ukraine, though such credits could be very helpful in creating  the stabilization fund for Ukraine's new monetary unit.  Meanwhile, Ukraine's economic stabilization would allow the  nation to apply foreign credits to other than pressing needs,  purposes.    As Mr. Mityukov disclosed, an agreement was reached with IMF  experts on the correctness of the national monetary unit's  regulated rate vis-a-vis absent currency exchange operations,  necessary to define it. However, they remain adamant in their  demand to abolish multiple karbovanets rates.  <H5>  Relations With Russia </H5>   Ukraine has not abandoned hope for settling with Russia the  sensitive issue of sharing the late USSR's assets and  liabilities.    Negotiations to this effect have not been successful, so  far,  with Russia having declared itself the USSR's sole legal  successor and denying Ukraine's right to use the USSR's assets  and service its debt.    According to Mr. Mityukov, by the time the USSR  disintegrated its assets were composed of 74 billion foreign  currency rubles (one such ruble was roughly equal to 1.5 USD) in  credits granted to developing nations, 47 to 48 billion rubles  in debts of the former COMECON nations, 3.5 billion rubles in  realty and property abroad, and 295 tons of gold.    The USSR's gross debt amounted to 81 billion dollars and  17.3  billion rubles to COMECON nations.    In addition to the problem of sharing the former USSR's  assets and liabilities Ukraine has been trying to push Russia to  extinguishing internal currency indebtedness, which in Mr.  Mityukov's opinion, should be the Russian Finance Ministry's  responsibility and task.    According to NBU estimates, the Soviet Vneshekonombank owes  400 million dollars to Ukrainian natural person-citizens, while  other banks of the former USSR owe 81.5 million dollars for  exported Ukrainian grain plus 25 million dollars in Ukrainian  collective farms' means.  <H5>  Foreign Banks' Operations in Ukraine </H5>   Igor Mityukov tends to believe that foreign banks' activity  in Ukraine cannot significantly improve the national financial  system. Foreign bank affiliates in Ukraine employ predominantly  Ukrainian personnel, and their operations are executed within a  very narrow field.    The only bank, out of eight foreign banks established in  Ukraine, whose presence is tangible on the Ukrainian market , is  the First Ukrainian International Bank. However, it utilizes  sizeable state capital.    Thus, as the NBU vice-president asserts, the National Bank's  decision to limit the foreign banks' scope of activity to only  non-residents, was a justified and well-grounded one.</p>

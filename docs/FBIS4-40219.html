			<p>BFN     [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 10/6/1994 -- "The exaggerated  tendency of the governing party to control all spheres of  activity reveals its aspiration to return to the period and  standards when Article 6 of the Constitution (on the role of the  Communist Party) was the foundation," states a declaration of  the Council of the Democratic Labor Party of Moldova (PDMM),  published today by the newspaper GLASUL NATIUNII (VOICE OF  NATION.) According to the declaration, "the policy pursued in  the spiritual sphere has become aggressive; a total reversal of  what was achieved during 1992 and 1993 is taking place here."  The massive firing of democratic journalists, the  monopolization of television and radio, and the regulation of  the official press proves that the media financed by the entire  population is becoming a slave to the interests of a single  party, states the declaration. The PDMM says that "the  extension of the results of parliamentary elections over local  administration bodies is a grave transgression of the  Constitution. Through presidential decrees of Mircea Snegur, the  results of the 1990 elections for local administrative bodies  are practically annulled. The dismissal of some mayors and  chairmen of district executive committees is an abuse of the  authorities and a serious violation of the millions of voters'  interests expressed in the elections that no one annulled." The  PDMM considers that the results of the presidential elections of  1991 are put in question as the sole candidate, Mircea Snegur,  did not represent any party. "The PDMM informs the CSCE  representatives, the Council of Europe, foreign embassies, and  all political movements in this country and abroad about the  dangerous trends in the conduct of the current Moldovan  leadership." The declaration also states that the party will  "use in the future all legal means to prevent the real threat of  restored totalitarianism and obscurantism in our country,"  concludes the declaration.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Reformulated and oxygenated fuel requirements in Title II of the Act will affect gasoline composition and the resulting HAP emissions. Reformulated fuel requirements specify a reduced benzene content, a minimum oxygen content, and a likely reduction in aromatic components of the blend. Reformulated gasoline is required throughout the year in the nine worst ozone nonattainment areas in the United States to reduce ozone forming VOC emissions during the summer months and air toxic emissions (benzene, 1,3-butadiene, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, POM) year-round from gasoline vehicles by 15 percent beginning in 1995 and 25 percent in 2000. Other areas may choose to implement the prohibition provision [Section 211(k)(5) of the 1990 amendments] and thus enter the program as well. Oxygenated fuels program requires the use of oxygenates in gasoline during the winter months in all carbon monoxide (CO) nonattainment areas to reduce CO emissions. While significantly decreasing VOC, CO, and air toxics emissions, both the reformulated and oxygenated fuels programs could lead to an increase in HAP emissions due to the fact that MTBE is listed as a HAP in the Act section 112(b) of the Act and is expected to be used in a large portion of the market to meet the oxygenate requirements of these programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This increase will come about because to meet minimum oxygen requirements under the reformulated gasoline and oxygenated fuels programs, approximately 11 percent and 15 percent by volume of MTBE is needed in liquid gasoline, respectively. Since MTBE is much more volatile than the aromatic compounds that it will replace in the blend, a much higher concentration of HAP's in the vapor phase of this fuel will result. Therefore, it is expected that the inclusion of MTBE may increase the HAP/VOC ratio in gasoline vapor from approximately 5 weight percent for normal gasoline to nearly 15 percent for oxygenated gasoline. The actual increase in HAPs at facilities distributing reformulated gasolines and oxygenated fuels will depend on the fraction of their fuel containing MTBE as opposed to other oxygenates such as ethanol or ETBE. Furthermore, while the weight percent of HAP's may increase due to the presence of MTBE, this will be offset to some extent under the reformulated gasoline program by reducing the toxic air pollutants required by the ACT and the deep volatility controls expected to result from the reformulated gasoline program during the summer months.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The above mentioned programs, guidelines, and standards (fuels programs, CTGs, NSPS) were considered, and their impacts on the gasoline distribution network estimated, before the development of control alternatives for this proposed rulemaking began. As a consequence, all emission reductions, costs, and other impacts discussed in the forthcoming sections are incremental to existing control programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Summary of the Proposed Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Sources Covered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Sources in the gasoline distribution category are a combination of major sources and area sources. Some pipeline breakout stations and bulk gasoline terminals have been determined to be major sources, since larger breakout stations and terminals may emit either 10 tpy or greater of individual HAP's (i.e. hexane, MTBE) or 25 tpy or greater of a combination of HAP's. For purposes of this rulemaking, the Agency is proposing that major source pipeline breakout stations and bulk gasoline terminals in the gasoline distribution source category be regulated under maximum achievable control technology (MACT) standards. The following is a summary of the methods used to determine applicability of the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Applicability Determination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed standard applies to all major source pipeline breakout stations and bulk gasoline terminals. Today's proposed standards provide two ways to determine if a facility is not a major source and not subject to the rule. They are: (1) The owner or operator provides documentation to the Administrator that the facility is not a major source as defined in section 112(a) by means of completion of an emissions audit at the facility, or (2) from the result of the following equations for estimating facility emissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency has determined the following equations properly estimate if the facility is a major source. A bulk gasoline terminal is not considered a major source if the result of the calculation in equation (1), E <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> T <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , is less than 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> (1) E <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=5 f=2 --> T <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 -->  = 0.63(T <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=5 f=2 --> F <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> ) + 0.19(T <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=5 f=2 --> E <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> ) + 0.092(T <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=5 f=2 --> ES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> ) + 0.03(T <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=5 f=2 --> I <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> ) + 0.0012(V) + 0.024(P) + KQ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> where:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=14 g=1 f=1 --> E <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=14 g=5 f=2 --> T <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=14 g=1 f=1 -->  = major source applicability factor for bulk gasoline terminals, E <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=14 g=5 f=2 --> T <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=14 g=1 f=1 -->  " 1 means bulk gasoline terminal is a major source, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> T <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=14 g=5 f=2 --> F <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=14 g=1 f=1 -->  = total number of fixed-roof gasoline storage tanks,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> T <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=14 g=5 f=2 --> E <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=14 g=1 f=1 -->  = total number of external floating roof gasoline storage tanks with only primary seals,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

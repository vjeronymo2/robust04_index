			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Survey of Madeira (7): Old favourite revived - Vintners hit by the fashion for lighter drinking wines SHAKESPEARE'S hapless Duke of Clarence was drowned in a whole butt of it after being stabbed. George Washington drank a pint a day. It was used to toast the American Declaration of Independence, and the Russian tsars had a fine collection that was recently unearthed when their Communist successors fell from power. Madeira's potent sweet wine has been known to the world for over four centuries, and its extraordinary powers of longevity have been an enduring source of marvel. Winston Churchill, another devotee, once exclaimed in amazement when he realised the wine he was drinking had been made during Marie Antoinette's lifetime. These days Madeira has been left on the sideboard by the fashion for lighter drinking wines, and the old-established shippers on the island are fighting to keep their markets and upgrade a product which has lost its cachet. 'There's a great antipathy to fortified wines in the world,' says Mr Michael Blandy, chief executive of the Madeira operations of the Blandy group, founded on the island in 1811. 'It goes along with the antipathy towards spirits and obviously it's an area of considerable concern for us.' Too small to compete in the international wine market alone, Blandy's sold a 51 per cent stake in its Madeira Wine Company to Symington's, the leading port wine shippers, in 1989, to take advantage of the latter's strength in distribution and marketing. Blandy's still holds 40 per cent of the company, which sells the leading brands established by British houses - such as Blandy, Cossart Gordon and Leacock - and accounts for 33 per cent of total sales of Madeira. One of the company's aims is to reduce the proportion of wine sold in bulk. This year bulk sales are expected to amount to 750,000 litres out of a total of 1.4m litres. Most of this goes to France, and a few other European countries, for cooking. 'What we want to do is promote the drinking wine. Selling bulk to the cooking market does quite the opposite,' explains Mr Blandy. Following promotion of bottled wine in France, the company expects to sell 65,000 litres there this year. The once jazzy bottle labels have been redesigned, using refined lettering and sober colours. Production techniques are also being improved, with better filtration of the wine and more sophisticated controls during the unique estufagem, or heating process. This procedure, which gives the wine its slightly burnt flavour, was developed by accident. The first Madeira grape, the sweet Malmsey, was introduced from Crete in the 15th century by Prince Henry the Navigator. Around the start of the 18th century, the story goes, a shipload of casks was sent to a British regiment in India, but undelivered. Upon return to Madeira, after the long journey across the Equator and back, it was found that the taste of the wine had actually benefited from the heat and the rolling of the ship. The baking process was simulated on land, first using sunlight and later hot water pipes to keep the wine lodges warm. Fortification began a few years later, when rumours of war kept ships away, and merchants on the island added brandy to preserve their stocks. At the height of its popularity in the early 19th century, at least 17,000 pipes (of 500 litres each) of Madeira were shipped each year, according to an account by Noel Cossart in Andre Simon's Wines of the World. But the vines were struck down, first by mildew in 1851, and then by phylloxera, which hit Europe in 1860. At the turn of this century, an average 5,000 pipes were being shipped a year. Today, sales total a little under 8,000 pipes, or 4m litres, a year. While production has been static for a decade, the European Community has played an important role in upgrading quality, funding a programme under the supervision of Madeira's wine institute to root out the poorest vines and replant with superior ones in the limited 2,000 hectares available for viticulture. Under EC rules, too, Madeira may only carry the name of one of 'the noble varieties' - Malmsey, Bual, Verdelho and the driest, Sercial - if it contains at least 85 per cent of that grape in the blend. The main overseas markets for bottled Madeira are the UK, Scandinavia, Japan, and north America. The wine institute attends all the European wine fairs, and next year will visit the US and Japan. In its promotional forays to win the world back to fortified wine, the institute has had to contend with a niggling problem over names in the US and in Russia. It won its case in Russia but was unsuccessful in the US where a wine is produced in California's Madera Valley.</p>

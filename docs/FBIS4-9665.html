			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] (NA-DYN) Gustavo Bossert and Guillermo Lopez were  sworn in yesterday as new Supreme Court justices during a brief  ceremony, thus restoring court strength to nine.    Bossert and Lopez were sworn in yesterday by interim chief  justice Julio Nazareno during a seven-minute ceremony carried  out at noon in Central Courthouse.    The ceremony was not attended by Justice Minister Jorge  Maiorano, who allegedly has serious internal differences with a  number of justices.    Despite the fact that it was officially reported that the  minister did not attend the ceremony "due to previous  engagements," court sources said that Justices Enrique Petracchi  and Augusto Delluscio had allegedly announced that they would  not go if they saw Maiorano there.    Maiorano later confirmed that he had not turned up the  Central Courthouse to see Bossert and Lopez become new justices  because he had been warned about Belluscio and Petracchi's  decision. The new justices replace Rodolfo Barra and Mariano  Cavagna Martinez, who are both to the Constituent Assembly.  [passage omitted]</p>

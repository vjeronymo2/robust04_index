			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Unit trust funds drop to Pounds 57bn FUNDS under management in unit trusts dropped last month to Pounds 57bn after breaking the Pounds 60bn barrier in May. This was in spite of an increase in net sales of unit trust personal equity plans (Peps) to Pounds 336.4m in the second quarter, pushing the value of unit trust Pep funds over the Pounds 2bn mark to Pounds 2.4bn. But unit trusts last month experienced their first outflow since February, with sales exceeding purchases by Pounds 23.5m. Total sales last month were Pounds 617.4m, a big drop on the previous month and on the Pounds 1bn achieved in April. However, net inflows in the second quarter of the year, at Pounds 463.8m, far exceeded the Pounds 255.8m achieved in the first quarter and represented one of the highest quarterly sales since 1989. Inflows into unit trust Peps were aided in the second quarter by the change to Pep rules in the Budget. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, announced that Pounds 6,000 could be invested in a unit or investment trust Pep from the start of the 1992-93 tax year. The previous limit had been Pounds 3,000. Mr Philip Warland, director-general of the Unit Trust Association said: 'The sales of Peps are a quite remarkable achievement in a personal savings market which saw outflows from building societies and the great attraction of National Savings.'</p>

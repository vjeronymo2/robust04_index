			<p>920413 FT  13 APR 92 / Russian leaders threaten to quit if powers are curbed THE RUSSIAN government is expected to decide today whether to resign after a weekend vote by parliament threatened to hobble its market reforms and limit its powers. Mr Yegor Gaidar, the first deputy prime minister, yesterday threatened to quit with his team of economic reformers unless an 11th hour compromise, worked out with parliamentary leaders, is adopted by the Congress of People's Deputies. The compromise resolution, due to be put to the vote today, frees the government from having to make specific policy changes which had been demanded by parliament on Saturday. But it leaves untouched a three-month deadline parliament gave itself to produce a new law on how the government is appointed - giving it the right to sack the cabinet. A spokesman for Mr Gaidar said last night that parliament's long list of policy demands was unrealistic, contradictory and would cost as much as Rbs1,500bn. The Congress of People's Deputies' decisions in effect gave the government three more months in office and demanded changes which Mr Gaidar described as 'the death of any hopes of serious co-operation with the outside world in healing our economy'. 'If you try seriously to put into effect what the Congress agreed today . . . you must understand that this is the road to the collapse of the financial system,' Mr Gaidar said on Saturday. Mr Alexander Shokhin, a vice-premier, said a Dollars 24bn (Pounds 13.9bn) western aid package for Russia to assist the switch to a market economy now 'hung by a thread'. President Boris Yeltsin's supporters said after the vote that the Russian leader might call a referendum on whether the country wanted presidential government or a weak parliamentary system. The issue has yet to be decided because Russia has not adopted a new constitution. On Friday evening the government was set to celebrate its survival with a series of successes for Mr Yeltsin earlier in the day. But after a vote of no confidence in the government was easily defeated on Saturday morning, Mr Yeltsin's request to retain the premiership and the right to name the cabinet until the end of the year fell 39 votes short of the 531 needed. The former Soviet Union's four nuclear republics have failed to agree on a joint ratification of the Start treaty, agreed with the US before the Soviet Union collapsed, to cut long-range nuclear arsenals. The disagreement centred on Ukraine's refusal at weekend talks in Moscow to recognise Russia as the Soviet Union's heir with respect to the treaty.</p>

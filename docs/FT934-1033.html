			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Survey of Sweden (8): Bridge still awaits go-ahead - Link with Denmark When PLM, the Swedish international packaging group with its headquarters in Malmo, calls together managers from its 13 European plants, they usually meet in Copenhagen, on the Danish side of the narrow straits which separates Sweden from Denmark at the entrance to the Baltic. The managers fly into Copenhagen's Kastrup international airport, but to get from there to Malmo by hovercraft connection - which the weather sometimes prevents - adds about 90 minutes to the journey, allowing for waiting time, says Mr Per Erlandsson, head of corporate communications. For this reason alone, PLM, like most of the companies in southern Sweden, will welcome the day when the planned road-and-rail bridge across the Oresund is completed, cutting travel time between Kastrup and Malmo to about 30 minutes. Sweden and Denmark have signed a treaty by which the two states are committed to building the bridge and the governments have set up a joint consortium, Oresundskonsortiet, to plan, finance and act as main contractor for the project. It will cost about DKr19bn, including the on-land investments on the Danish and Swedish sides of the link. Construction should begin in 1994, although political obstacles to the final decision to go ahead have yet to be resolved. Sweden's Centre Party, headed by Mr Olaf Johansson, minister for the environment, is opposed to the bridge, for environmental reasons. If the government decides to give the go-ahead to construction - Mr Carl Bildt, the prime minister, has said that he hopes the decision can be taken before the end of the year - there will be pressure from the party organisation for the Centre Party to withdraw from the government. Perhaps it is not entirely coincidental that the Centre Party is the Swedish party which is least enthusiastic - although not completely set against - Sweden's membership of the European Union. For, as Mr Erlandsson says, the bridge also has an important symbolic value: 'It will show that Sweden wants to get closer to Europe.' Geographers on both sides of the Oresund, meanwhile, are in little doubt that the bridge will be of enormous significance for southern Sweden and the Copenhagen area. 'The bridge will, without question, revitalise industry and the regional workforce' in Scania (the province of southern Sweden) and Sjflland (the large Danish island on which Copenhagen is sited), wrote* Professor Lars Nordstrom, transport economist from Chlamers Technical University, Gothenburg. Musing over the controversies which surround the bridge at present, he suggested that in the long term the bridge would bind Malmo and Copenhagen together so closely that it would appear odd that the bridge once did not exist. And if something should happen to the bridge, it would be regarded by future generations as a catastrophe. As things stand, Copenhagen and Malmo might as well be hundreds of kilometres from each other, not just the 18km which in fact is all that separates them, says Professor Christian Wichmann Mathiessen of Copenhagen University, a Danish geographer who is one of the more visionary enthusiasts of the bridge. The city regions on either side of the sound are 'completely separate systems', he says, pointing to surveys which suggest that for every personal contact between residents on the two sides of the sound there are 16 contacts between residents of southern Sweden and Stockholm. The Oresund, according to Professor Mathiessen, is one of the world's great traffic junctions: the land traffic junction between Sweden and continental Europe; an important shipping lane; and the site of one of northern Europe's largest airports, Kastrup. Within a radius of 50km of Kastrup there is a population of 2.3m people, making it the 20th-largest city region in Europe. Copenhagen - the population of the greater Copenhagen area is about 1.3m - ranks as the 32nd-largest and Malmo - population 235,000 - is 140th. In terms of purchasing power, the Oresund region ranks as eighth in Europe. The region is already an important area for scientific research, but could become even more so if the scientific communities on the two sides of the sound were to become more integrated. In terms of research capacity, Copenhagen ranks 12th in Europe; Malmo and the university town of Lund rank 30th. Together, the region ranks fourth or fifth in Europe for its research capacity. On the Swedish side, Astra, the pharmaceuticals giant, Gambro, medical-technical products, Tetra Pak Alfa Laval, food industry machinery, and Kockums, the shipyard specialising in submarines, are among the companies which give Malmo and Lund a high-technology profile. Once the bridge is built, the separate systems will begin to change. 'The sound area will rapidly shift from the old balance situation with two separate systems which both function well, into a system with a new balance, characterised by new movements of people, merchandise, services, information, energy and money,' says Professor Mathiessen. But it will not happen on its own. 'It all depends on local mobilisation. The future market should be shining bright for the population, politicians and administrators and business leaders. What is needed is action, local action.' In Malmo they agree. 'The bridge alone won't do it,' says Mr Dag Fagring, city promotion manager, although the bridge will help by focusing attention on the city. He has just put forward a SKr6m promotion programme, Advantage Malmo, to try to persuade business, Swedish as well as international, that Malmo is a good place to be, and, with the bridge in prospect, getting better all the time. *Quotations from Professors Nordstrom and Mathiessen are from Oresund - Past, Present and Future (Essays on the Oresund region), published by Coronoa AB, Malmo 1993)</p>

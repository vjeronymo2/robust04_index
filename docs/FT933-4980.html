			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / International Company News: Canadian Pizza for market with Pounds 40m value THE CANADIAN Pizza Group, a Salford-based company which exports its pizzas to several European markets - including Italy - will be floated on the stock market this autumn. The group, which will have a market capitalisation of about Pounds 40m, was the subject of a Pounds 15.5m management buy-out from its Canadian parent in May last year. Canadian Pizza makes 40m pizza crusts per year and supplies about 35 per cent of the pizzas sold by UK superstores as their own brands. It employs 250 people at plants in Salford and Nelson in Lancashire. Pre-tax profits increased last year from Pounds 1.3m to Pounds 2.2m on sales which grew from Pounds 11m to Pounds 15.2m. The group believes a listing will enhance its ability to exploit the growth potential of the chilled and frozen pizza market, as the additional capital raised will be invested in new production facilities. Southern France is a possible location for a new factory. A growing segment is the in-store delicatessen custom-made pizza, for which the company supplies cases. In 1982 Mr Harry Kent, co-founder of the group, began importing pizza crusts made in Canada by the Canadian Pizza Crust Company, run by Mr Gino Molinaro. In 1985, Mr Molinaro and Mr Kent established a business to make pizza bases in the UK. In May last year Mr Molinaro sold his stake in the business to a management buy-out led by Mr Kent, with the support of Murray Johnstone, 3i and ECI Ventures. Mr Kent, the group's deputy chairman, said: 'Pizzas are an increasingly popular snack food . . . I have no doubt that progress, particularly into the chilled market, will continue at an above average rate in comparison to overall retail sales.' The float will be sponsored by Robert Fleming and Hoare Govett will act as broker to the issue.</p>

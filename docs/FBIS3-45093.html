"A plan to develop the island is just in its initial stages  and the government will not make a final decision until prudent  evaluation and planning can be done," Hsiao said during a joint  meeting of the Legislative Yuan's overseas Chinese affairs,  interior and economic affairs committees Monday morning.    During a private visit to Singapore last week, Premier Lien  Chan proposed that Taiwan and Singapore join hands to develop  the island, which is open to foreign investment as a special  economic zone.    Lien noted that Taiwan investments in the mainland will be  better protected if they are under the name of  Singapore-registered enterprises because Singapore has signed  investment guarantee pacts with both Taiwan and the mainland.    Vice Chairman Kao Kung-lien of the Mainland Affairs Council  said at the same meeting that the government will not engage in  direct economic and trade cooperation with Mainland China for  the time being.    He said that in accordance with the guidelines for national  unification, local businessmen would be able to invest in Hainan  Island through a third party and after approval from the  government.    Hainan Island boasts rich natural resources, cheap, abundant  labor, and holds the right to enact investment laws, Kao added.    Hainan however, is also facing problems resulting from poor  infrastructure, insufficient financial support and a serious  brain drain.    Kao said any plan for developing Hainan Island should take  place after both sides of the Taiwan Strait sign agreements on  joint exploitation of energy and natural resources.    In related news, Hainan authorities will establish a Hainan-  Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao economic promotion association soon  to promote Hainan's exchanges and cooperative ties with those  regions.</p>

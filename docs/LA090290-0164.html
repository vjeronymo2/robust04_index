			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERSONAL FINANCE / BILL SING: INVESTING IN STOCKS OR BONDS FOR $1,000 OR LESS  </P> <P> Have you ever had only about $1,000 to invest and wondered if you couldn't earn  a higher return on it than in a crummy savings or checking account?  </P> <P> Many people often assume that buying stocks, bonds or precious metals with so  little money isn't too smart. They figure that they can't get adequate  diversification or that brokerage commissions or other fees will consume too  high a proportion of the investment.  </P> <P> Fortunately, these people are wrong. There are many ways you can invest $1,000  that will not only give you a decent profit potential but also diversification  and low transaction costs.  </P> <P> Many mutual funds allow low minimum initial investments and don't carry sales  charges. In fact, you can put together a $1,000 portfolio -- including stock  and bond mutual funds, real estate and gold -- that in some ways is as  diversified as portfolios of giant pension funds.  </P> <P> Here are various elements that can be included in your diversified, low-cost  $1,000 portfolio:  </P> <P> * Savings bonds. You can buy a Series EE savings bond from a bank for as little  as $25. That will get you a bond with a $50 face value. And there is no fee or  service charge.  </P> <P> This bond can help finance your kids' college education. That's because  proceeds are free of federal tax if used for college tuition, provided you meet  certain income and other criteria.  </P> <P> * Zero-coupon bonds. Here's another way to save for your kids' college  education. Zero-coupon Treasury bonds can be bought for less than $1,000,  depending on the maturity. Like savings bonds, they are sold at a discount from  face value; you earn interest by getting the full face value at maturity. (But  be aware that this accrued interest is taxable each year, even though you don't  receive it in cash.)  </P> <P> Got no kids? If you want some excitement, buy zeroes anyway. They are one of  the best investments for a recession or a period of declining interest rates,  because they shoot up in price when interest rates fall. You can buy zeroes  through mutual funds. Benham Capital Management, (800) 472-3389, and Scudder,  Stevens &amp; Clark, (800) 225-2470, offer such funds with $1,000 minimums.  </P> <P> * Certificates of deposit. Several banks and savings and loans nationwide offer  CDs for as little as $250 that are among the highest yielding in the nation.  </P> <P> John Hanson Savings of Beltsville, Md., (800) 448-5151, offered an annual  effective yield of 8.47% on a six-month CD with a $1,000 minimum. That was the  second-highest yield in the nation, according to 100 Highest Yields, a North  Palm Beach, Fla., newsletter.  </P> <P> In the five-year CD category, NVR Savings Bank of McLean, Va., (800) 842-5825,  led the nation with an 8.8% annual effective yield. Its minimum is only $500.  </P> <P> * Money market mutual funds. Most mutual funds carry minimum investment  requirements of $1,000 or less. Some have minimums of $500 or less. And  virtually all charge no sales fees.  </P> <P> * Stock and bond mutual funds. Many fund companies are raising their required  minimum initial investments to spread their costs over more dollars invested.  </P> <P> But many no-load (no sales commission) mutual funds are still available with  minimum investments of $1,000 or less. One firm, Twentieth Century Investors,  (800) 345-2021, even has no minimum initial investment requirement at all. It  offers several growth-stock funds that have been among the top performing  equity funds in recent years.  </P> <P> Another respected fund family, Financial Programs, (800) 525-8085, requires  only a $250 minimum initial investment.  </P> <P> Want to invest in foreign stocks? Financial Programs offers funds investing in  both European and Asian markets.  </P> <P> Interested in ethical investing? Pax World, (603) 431-8022, with a $250 minimum  initial investment, applies socially conscious criteria to its purchases of  domestic stocks and bonds. (For example, it avoids firms in defense, tobacco  and liquor.)  </P> <P> If stocks aren't your thing, there also are numerous bond funds available for  low minimums. They invest in everything from high-risk junk bonds to low-risk  Treasury securities. Some provide shelter by investing in tax-free municipal  bonds.  </P> <P> For a guide listing 2,900 mutual funds and their minimum investment  requirements, fees and other basic information, send $5 to: Guide, Investment  Company Institute, 1600 M St., N.W., Suite 600, Washington, D.C. 20036.  </P> <P> * Gold. You can buy gold bullion coins, including American Eagles or Canadian  Maple Leafs, in sizes as small as one-tenth of an ounce. That will cost you  about one-tenth the market price of an ounce of gold -- plus service charges  and a slight premium.  </P> <P> But if you really want to play the gold market, you might be better off buying  a mutual fund investing in gold stocks and the metal itself. These will give  you more bang for your buck, with no sales charges if you buy a no-load fund.  </P> <P> For $100, you can buy into two funds offered by United Services Advisers, (800)  873-8637, U.S. Gold Shares or New Prospector. For $1,000, you can invest in  USAA Gold, (800) 531-8000, or Lexington Goldfund, (800) 526-0057, among others.  </P> <P> * Real estate. You can't buy property or buildings that cheap. But you can buy  shares in a real estate investment trust investing in office buildings,  shopping centers, warehouses and other commercial property. Their shares are  traded on stock exchanges.  </P></p>

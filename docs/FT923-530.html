			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Management: Tea and sympathy for under-valued personnel managers Why do so few chief executives come from personnel backgrounds? For most service companies and in many in other sectors, the salary bill is the single largest revenue expense, yet those whose principal function is advising on human resource management rarely make it to the top. Indeed, many of those who work in a broad range of companies are struck by the relative powerlessness of many personnel professionals. This is the case even in companies that have attempted to change the focus of the function by creating 'human resources' departments. The influence of the personnel function is generally highest in the large bureaucracies which are more concerned with the faithful execution of procedures than the achievement of results. But even the large regulatory bureaucracies have recently been seeking to change their cultures towards a greater focus on customer service. Personnel people are frequently to be found at the confluence of three streams of activity - administration, welfare and industrial relations. However, each of these functions is, itself, changing. Administration is becoming increasingly computerised, requiring less specialised knowledge of procedures but more of systems. Welfare is seen as anachronistic and is disparagingly characterised as 'tea and sympathy', though its function remains important. Industrial relations has changed profoundly since the days of pre-Thatcherite Britain. Other reasons for personnel's apparent decline are more self-inflicted: Personal attributes. Sensitive to the pain of others, conscious of the costs of redundancy and sensitised to personal difficulties, personnel managers are chosen, not for their tough independence, but for their caring personae which may well count against them. Reactive approach. Coming from an administrative background, some personnel specialists have a detailed and reactive approach to work and find it difficult to make a contribution to the creation of future strategy, even when the creative use of human resources may make the most enormous difference to a company's competitive strength. Lack of information. Unlike colleagues in operations or finance, they frequently lack an important source of management information which will guide senior managers' decision-making. Invisibility. It is frequently difficult or impossible to detect the effect of the personnel department on an organisation. Most other departments' effects are readily discernible and their impact is immediate. If the personnel specialist has a role in the future, it is as an internal consultant to line management. But, in order to play this role, specialists will have to develop themselves. First, as markets change, organisations need to change. Helping to develop the organisation and its workforce requires a great deal of skill which it would be legitimate for many line managers to seek in the personnel function. Second, personnel departments should be playing a role in devising tracking systems to enable senior managers to keep in touch with the thoughts and feelings of employees. Those who advocate Management By Walking About suggest that managers will automatically discern what is important. But this does not take into account the difficulties of tracking the mood of the large, complex and multinational organisation. Finally, there is a perennial need to use human resources creatively and come up with increasingly compelling reward schemes which are not based on contributing to salary inflation. Personnel departments need performance-related strategies which are logical, coherent and integrated both with other departments' plans and overall business plans.

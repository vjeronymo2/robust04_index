			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Lack of choice on technologies worrying Sir, I welcome the idea that the UK is to pick ideas in which technology funding should be concentrated ('Science foresight plan launched', September 13). As with any company, the UK needs to have a clear vision of where to invest its resources in order to develop a competitive technological position. However, it is worrying to learn that the technology foresight steering group has yet to decide how to choose between technologies. The process suggested - in which many scientists, academics and industrialists will be consulted - may unfortunately lead to the choice of important technologies in which we cannot be competitive. We need to decide where we will try to be world leaders, where we are better working in partnerships (for example, with our colleagues in the European Community), and where we would do better to buy in. Britain is to some extent a niche player in the world of technology: it needs to choose carefully. The government must also make best use of the substantial independent contract research and development sector in enhancing these technologies. This sector provides a cost-effective means of transferring technology to a broad range of industries in the UK, while maintaining centres of excellence.

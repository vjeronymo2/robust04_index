			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Trading officers unite against counterfeiters A national intelligence and data service has been launched to try to curb pirated goods that may be costing Britain up to Pounds 1bn a year. 'Counterfeit goods have reached epidemic levels in the UK,' said Mr Ed Chicken, the Institute of Trading Standards Administration official masterminding the service. Its remit will include logging counterfeiting prosecutions and seizures. The institute says counterfeiting has become a core activity for organised crime because of the big rewards and low risk of prosecution. British counterfeiters are mass-producing designer-label clothing, audio and video tapes, perfume, watches, computer software, leisure goods, toys, furniture, pottery and antiques. The service will log where goods were seized and from whom, and will produce the UK's first annual statistics on counterfeiting. The institute has also set up a network of intelligence officers who will supply to the national agency information on suspects and the distinctive features of pirated goods. The ITSA will need clearance under the Data Protection Act to store the intelligence data on computer, and is considering how it could ensure security. It believes the information could do much to curb counterfeiting crime. 'Trading standards offices cover local areas, but the mass producers of counterfeited goods operate in networks across the UK,' said Mr Chicken. 'Pooling local intelligence is going to really help us to track these people down.' The surge in counterfeiting has brought urgent calls from industry for national co-ordination to combat it. The industry-led Anti-Counterfeiting Group says copied goods are cutting the turnover of legitimate producers and retailers, and are causing lost jobs and tax revenues. 'Up until now monitoring has been haphazard,' Mr Chicken said. This has restricted investigations to local level and has hampered efforts to develop national enforcement strategies. Last year the institute made an initial effort to quantify the scale of counterfeiting through questionnaires sent to trading standards offices. The 78 per cent of offices that responded seized nearly Pounds 9m-worth of goods last year against which charges were laid, but up to 10 times that amount was seized without subsequent legal action. 'We are not really interested in prosecuting the street traders themselves,' said Mr Len Swift, leader of North Yorkshire's trading standards special operations unit. 'We often just seize and caution. It is the producers and organisers that we are trying to stop.' However, only an estimated 10 per cent of pirated goods circulating in the UK are seized by companies, trading standards offices and the police, says the group.</p>

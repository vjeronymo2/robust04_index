			<p>BFN     [Text] On the occasion of the official friendship visit to  Vietnam by Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt, the paper NHAN DAN  on 7 April carried an editorial entitled: "Strengthen the  Relations of Friendship and Cooperation Between Vietnam and  Sweden." The editorial says:    The world economic crisis has caused numerous difficulties  for the Swedish economy. As a result, the Swedish Government,  headed by Prime Minister Carl Bildt after the 1991 election, has  cut its development aid to foreign countries. However, it has  increased aid to our nation and has become the country with the  largest volume of non-refundable aid to Vietnam.    The Swedish Government and businessmen have highly appraised  Vietnam's renovation process and hailed the achievements  recorded by our country in this regard. Our Swedish friends  have also expressed their wish to expand cooperation with  Vietnam and enhance the fine relations between the two countries.    The official visit to Vietnam by Swedish Prime Minister Carl  Bildt is a significant event in the Vietnam-Swedish relations  and is in line with Vietnam's open door foreign policy.    The Vietnamese people warmly welcome the first visit to  Vietnam by the Swedish Prime Minister and wish him splendid  success. Indeed, the visit will contribute to strengthening the  friendship and cooperation between Vietnam and Sweden, thereby  meeting the aspiration and interest of the two peoples and  strengthening peace, stability, and development in the region.  062300</p>

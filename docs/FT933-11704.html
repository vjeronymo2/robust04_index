			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: UK economy The latest CBI survey will not make happy reading for a prime minister hoping to rebuild his tattered credibility. Far from promising an accelerating recovery as parliament reconvenes after the summer recess, it lends credence to anecdotal evidence that the recovery is slowing. A run-down of stocks is likely to inhibit domestic demand. Manufacturers are still not ready to invest in additional plant and machinery. Above all, export demand is softening because of the slowdown in Europe. That raises the question of how the British economy would be affected by any collapse of the ERM. Despite the recent rise in sterling, exporters seem more worried about the state of the markets in Europe than their competitiveness at current exchange rates. Arguably British exporters should thus benefit from a collapse of the ERM that brought lower interest rates across Europe and boosted demand. Initially, though, life could become even harder. The French franc might not fall far if it left the ERM but it would be weaker for a while, conferring advantage on French industry. As in the UK, continental demand might be slow to respond to lower interest rates. The case for lower UK interest rates would then be all the stronger, if only to prevent sterling rising further. Sterling's higher exchange rate may not yet have priced exporters out of Europe. But, with or without the ERM, exporters need to be super-competitive to gain share of what promises to remain an exceptionally weak market.</p>

			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / World News in Brief: Death sentence The death sentence was passed in the Isle of Man on a 22-year-old apprentice electrician convicted of slitting a woman's throat. It was probably the last time the sentence - which will be commuted to life imprisonment - will be passed in the British Isles because legislation to abolish it in the island is due to be passed this year.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: ``Quiet Diplomacy''] </F>   [Text] Mr. Strobe Talbott, after his meetings with the  Prime Minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto and the Foreign Minister,  Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali, does not seem to have closed the door on  further talks with Pakistan. Pakistan's position is that it  would relent on the NPT only if India does and the Indian  position is that it would relent only if the nuclear powers of  the world, including China, do. Of the two, Pakistan's position  would seem to be more amenable to a solution than India's but it  is harder of the two in the sense that it being absolutely the  basic minimum, leaves no room for any concession. Any  government giving so much as even a hint of freezing the nuclear  programme unilaterally, leaving the Indians free to carry on  theirs, would immediately fall. The Indian position, on the  surface, is far less amenable to any solution, because it seeks  to impose the NPT not on one country but on all the major powers  of the world, but is actually softer because its nonacceptance  does not really hurt India's vital security interests. In that  sense it is rather a phoney condition put up as a ploy to  extract a quid pro quo or blackmail the U.S. In the case of  Pakistan the quid pro quo is of F-16s. Pakistan having rejected  that, has now its back against the wall. It can retreat no  further. That is where the hardness of Pakistan's stance comes  in. India is angling for more and more from the U.S. before it  allows itself to capitulate on the NPT. It has already won from  the U.S. the promise of nonintervention in Kashmir. Mr.  Talbott's reference to the Simla Agreement and his silence on  Indian atrocities in Kashmir, seems to be part of that India's  other goal is to deprive Pakistan of conventional weapons.  Hence its insistence on blocking the delivery of F-16s to  Pakistan. The United States, on its part, has used the bait of  sponsorship of India for a permanent seat in the UN Security  Council, in return for a deal on NPT. So India has kept to  itself a number of options to play around.    In this game of quiet diplomacy likely to be played in the  days to come, Pakistan it seems would hardly hold any cards in  its hand. A time may come when it may have to choose between its  traditional friendship with the United States and its vital  security concerns. In contrast, the pressure on India is  minimal. India does not have to depend on the U.S. for  anything, inlcuding friendship. It already has a traditional  friend -- Russia -- in the Security Council. It has actually  used the U.S. to block Pakistan on Kashmir. The U.S. seems  willing enough to oblige India in some other areas also. India  suffers from no qualms to milk the U.S. diplomatically, now  under the cover of quiet diplomacy. The options for Pakistan,  on the other hand, are limited. But while it does not have to  let India take advantage of the U.S. obsession with the NPT, its  own stance on the NPT as well as on Kashmir being a moral one,  does snot have to be compromised for the sake of expediency.  The world, it is hoped, will come to distinguish between a  moral position and an immoral one. It did so, after all, in the  case of the Russian invasion of Afghanistan.</p>

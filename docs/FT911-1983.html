			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Philips gains 6.2% after quarterly figures BUYING interest focused on Philips yesterday, as most bourses were closed for the May Day holiday, writes Our Markets Staff. AMSTERDAM was pleasantly surprised by Philips' performance in the first quarter of 1991. The shares rose Fl 1.70 or 6.2 per cent to Fl 29 after the company reported much better-than-expected net profits. Philips apart, trading was quiet after Tuesday's holiday and in the absence of continental investors. The CBS tendency index lost 0.1 to 95.4. Aegon, the insurer, recovered Fl 2.10 to Fl 124.80. The stock has been weak since the insurer said recently that it planned to reduce the conversion price on an convertible bond as well as issue a new convertible bond next year. COPENHAGEN was helped by an excess of liquidity, following Tuesday's postponement of a bank strike set for May 10. The bourse index rose 2.08 to 346.95. Novo Nordisk, which attracted demand in New York overnight, was the most active stock, rising DKr7 to DKr424 with 108,600 shares traded. Danisco gained DKr12 to DKr947 after announcing the purchase of eight sugar factories in eastern Europe. ISTANBUL recovered half the losses recorded earlier this week as investors picked up bargains. A cheaper dollar and fresh cash inflow of around L1 trillion, after a government bond matured, contributed to the recovery. The 75-share index gained 235.06 or 6.6 per cent to 3,789.31. South Africa was closed yesterday for Workers' Day.  -------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100 - May 1  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes***     Open   10 am  11 am     Noon    1 pm    2 pm    3 pm   Close  1107.80 1107.99 1108.56 1108.69 1108.12 1108.82 1109.60 1110.32 Day's High   N/A      Day's Low   N/A     Apr 30     Apr 29     Apr 26     Apr 25     Apr 24    1111.29    1120.75    1115.94    1122.55    1119.18 Base value 1000 (26/10/90) *** Indicative.  --------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

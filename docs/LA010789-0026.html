			<p><P> January 7, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MONDAY SOUNDS GOOD TO PADRES  </P> <P> The Padres' winter of introductions continued Friday evening when the team  announced that former major league outfielder Rick Monday will fill the  broadcasting vacancy created by last fall's dismissal of Dave Campbell.  </P> <P> Monday, a 43-year-old former major league outfielder, joins Jerry Coleman, Ted  Leitner and Bob Chandler on Padre broadcasts. Monday will team with Coleman for  all 51 road television broadcasts, and the two will work together on all other  games on radio.  </P> <P> "I'm looking forward to being part of an organization that's been growing by  leaps and bounds," Monday said at a reception that served as the premiere of  the Padres' 1988 highlight film ("Changes in Attitudes"). "I was on a Caribbean  cruise 3 weeks ago with three Dodger players and a coach, and I can tell you,  there's a ballclub about 100 miles to the north that's extremely nervous over  all of the Padre acquisitions."  </P> <P> Monday signed a 2-year contract. No terms were announced, but the salary for  the Padres' No. 2 man is believed to be in the neighborhood of $125,000.  </P> <P> Monday has been a part of the Los Angeles Dodger cable broadcasting team and  until recently was sports anchor for KTTV (Ch. 11) in Los Angeles. He worked  the College World Series championship game with Brent Musburger in June for  CBS-TV.  </P> <P> Another man who regularly works with Musburger, on the CBS radio game of the  week, thinks Monday's presence is a positive step for the Padres.  </P> <P> "I can't think of anybody on earth who I'm more delighted to see than Rick  Monday," Coleman said. "He's a quality person, he knows baseball, and I can  chew the fat with him because he's a former player."  </P> <P> Monday sent a tape and resume to Jim Winters, the Padre director of  broadcasting, a couple of months ago, but he and the Padres began talking  seriously Wednesday when Monday flew to San Diego to meet with Winters and Dick  Freeman, the Padres' acting president. By late Friday morning -- nearly 2 weeks  after Winters' original Christmas goal -- an agreement was reached.  </P> <P> Winters then mentioned that the club was holding its annual party Friday night  to premiere the highlight film and wondered if Monday could make it down from  Santa Monica.  </P> <P> "As we were landing in San Diego, my wife (Karen) looked at me and said, 'Do  you kind of get the feeling that you've gotten traded to a club where you  wanted to go?' " Monday said. "And I said, 'Yes, but at least this time I'm  involved.' "  </P> <P> Monday, who will begin looking for a home in San Diego next week, summarized  his broadcasting style: "Be honest in what I see and care for what I do.  Basically, without being trite, that's about it. There are a lot of things  involved in broadcasting. Am I a homer? No, but I care about the organization,  and I'm a part of it. I'm not a sensationalist."  </P> <P> He said would like to accomplish two things in San Diego.  </P> <P> "I've been fortunate enough to be with a championship club as a player, now I'd  like nothing better than to be with one as a broadcaster," he said. "And I'm  looking forward to getting another haircut. The last one I got here was real  close."  </P> <P> Monday spent some time here with the U.S. Marine Corp Reserves in the early  1960s.  </P> <P> Winters had originally hoped to fill the vacancy with a potential replacement  for Coleman, whose 3-year contract expires at the end of the 1991 season. But  as the process became more and more involved, he soon was forced to change  directions.  </P> <P> It was thought several weeks ago that Gary Thorne was the leading candidate for  the vacancy, but he was hired as part of the Chicago White Sox television  broadcast team. Gary Cohen was also a candidate, but he joined the Mets.  </P> <P> The third choice was Chicago Cubs broadcaster Dewayne Staats, but he and the  Padres could not reach an agreement. Winters said he then realized the Padres  might be better off hiring a No. 2 man and worrying about replacing Coleman  when the time comes.  </P> <P> "After talking with the Dewayne Staatses and Gary Thornes of the world, we  found out that most of them wanted to step into the No. 1 slot right now,"  Winters said. "I don't blame them for that, but it became apparent to us that  to find a quality person, like a Rick Monday, maybe we should fill the No. 2  position."  </P> <P> Despite all that, Winters said Monday was under consideration throughout the  process. "His name was there. It just took a little while longer to get it  done," Winters said.  </P> <P> Padre Notes:  </P> <P> The Padres and pitcher Greg Booker have agreed to a 1-year contract. . . .  According to Dick Freeman, the Padres' acting president, season ticket sales  are about 30% ahead of last year's pace.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE RICK MONDAY DOSSIER  </P> <P> * 43 years old.

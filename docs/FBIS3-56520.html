In Andrejevs' opinion, this is witnessed by Russia's  reaction  to the Jan. 10 incident in Riga when the arrest of two generals  led to Russian troops stationed in Latvia being put on standby.    Andrejevs said the situation was critical, and that Russia  gave a vivid demonstration of which methods it plans to use in  an incident that could be solved through diplomatic channels.    The minister met yesterday with members of a CSCE mission to  Latvia who were interested in how a country in a situation  similar to the Jan. 10 incident can be helped. Andrejevs said  that Russia's consent is needed so that international observers  could attend the handover of Russian military facilities to  Latvia. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Survey of European Airports (7): Projects underline a serious ambition - Frankfurt and Munich Germany is serious about becoming a major European air hub, and its two main airport projects of the past few years only serve to emphasise this. The most recent is the opening last month of a second terminal at Frankfurt airport in an attempt to siphon away international traffic from London's Heathrow. At the same time the new Munich airport, opened in May 1992, is already handling 12.7m passengers a year and expects to increase that to 13.4m this year and eventually up to the terminal's capacity of 18m. With 58 services a week to North America, Munich is Germany's second-largest hub for overseas flights. Both aim to be passenger-friendly, and Munich is probably every passenger's dream. With just one terminal, without the 'satellites' and 'fingers' found at London's Gatwick and Paris Charles de Gaulle, it aims to make it easy to get around. Frankfurt's second terminal, built at a cost of DM1.6bn (Dollars 1.07bn), is the airport's answer to overcrowding. The airport, which serves 105 scheduled airlines, is second only to London's Heathrow and is the busiest passenger airport in continental Europe, and last year handled 32.5m passengers - almost three times its capacity when it opened in 1972. The new terminal expects to handle 5m passengers this year, and will be able to cope with between 10m and 12m passengers. Its new terminal is linked to the original facility with a driverless overhead shuttle, and meanwhile upgrading of Terminal 1 is under way, where Lufthansa, the national carrier, will occupy the western half of the building. But in spite of the huge projects at both airports, both have an eye on the future. At Munich, the next large project will be the Munich Airport Centre, which will include further airline offices, a conference centre and restaurants, and more shops and lounges. Meanwhile Frankfurt plans to link its two terminals with a third section to create what it calls a 'mega complex', and a second railway station for the airport is due to go into service before the turn of the century. Also on Frankfurt's agenda is readiness for the next generation of aircraft  -the 'super-jumbos' which will carry up to 800 passengers. During the construction of the terminal, the aircraft manufacturers were consulted about the likely dimensions of such aircraft, and as a result the eight terminal gate stands can all accommodate aircraft with a wingspan greater than today's 747s. However, it does not expect to have to expand its runway capacity until well after the turn of the century. By 'fine-tuning' its existing runway capacity the airport says it expects to be able to cope with additional aircraft movements up to 2010.</p>

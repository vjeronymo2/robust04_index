			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / International Company News: Honda pre-tax earnings down 53% at nine months Honda, the Japanese carmaker, suffered a 53.1 per cent decline in pre-tax profits to Y35.04bn (Dollars 330m) in the first nine months of its financial year to the end of December. Honda, which announced this week that it is to sever its 20 per cent equity link with Rover, the UK carmaker, blamed the fall in profits on the recession in Japan and Europe and on the strong yen. Honda's profits have been falling for three years. The strong yen cut group operating profits by Y103bn in the nine months, the company said. Group turnover in the period fell by 9.5 per cent to Y2,820bn. Pre-tax profits in the third quarter to December fell by 31 per cent to Y12.54bn from Y18.23bn a year earlier, while turnover fell by 2.8 per cent to Y947.96bn. Operating profits fell by 19 per cent to Y18.5bn from Y23.0bn. Honda said that the strong yen had reduced operating profits by Y38bn in the third quarter. The Japanese carmaker, which was stunned three weeks ago by the takeover by BMW of British Aerospace's 80 per cent stake in Rover, said yesterday that it was confident about treading an independent path in Europe. Mr Shinichi Tanaka, Honda spokesman, said that the company aimed to be independent in Europe. 'We are confident about pursuing our own way,' said Mr Tanaka. 'By early 1995 we will have a significant marketing force in Europe.' In the early 1980s Honda's entire focus had been on the US and at the time the company had not been capable of dealing with both the US and with Europe. The 15-year relationship with Rover had meant that 'we could get into Europe without sacrificing our operations in the US,' he said. Honda forecast that its European car sales, including both imported and locally produced vehicles, would rise by 15.8 per cent to 181,000 in 1994. The company said that it expected that tax cuts in Japan would boost domestic sales, but warned that excess stocks in the industry could lead to heavy discounting. Honda expected to continue reducing capacity in Japan to cope with lower demand and with an increasing transfer of manufacturing overseas. It has been slimming down its operations since 1992 and aims to be able to break even at a capacity level of 1m units. Honda said that it expected its car exports in 1994 to fall to 484,000 from 570,728 in 1993, while it forecast a rise in output overseas to 805,000 in 1994 from 677,000 last year. Honda said it was still on target to meet its forecast of net income of Y17.3bn in the current financial year, against Y37.1bn a year earlier, on a turnover of Y3,774bn, compared with Y4,132bn.</p>

			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Economic Diary: Other economic news Monday: The recovery in the UK and the US will be a focus of attention. In the UK, April's producer prices index today, and the Confederation of British Industry's distributive trade survey tomorrow, will provide clues about the strength of the upturn - and its impact on inflation. Market analysts expect April's output figures to rise to 0.3 per cent, month on month, from 0.1 per cent in February. Input prices, however, are expected to fall. In the US, April's industrial production figures will be scrutinised for clues about the pace of recovery. Wednesday: UK earnings figures are expected to illustrate the Bank of England's concern about the growth in average earnings. The growth rate for March is expected to be unchanged, at 3.5 per cent, after rising continuously since November. However, the three-month index, measured year on year, is expected to rise slightly to 2 per cent. In the US, the March trade deficit will be scrutinised by the foreign exchanges in the light of the dollar's recent weakness. Thursday: The report from the UK Treasury's panel of advisers - the 'six wise men' - is published.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Radmila Popova: "Ilinden United Macedonian </F> Organization Demanded Political Autonomy for Pirin Macedonia"]    [Text] At a news conference held on 9 March, Yordan  Ivanov, chairman of the unregistered Ilinden United Macedonian  Organization [Ilinden OMO], declared that the claim that the  Macedonians are Bulgarians is war propaganda. He accused the  government of racial discrimination, genocide, and apartheid,  adding that the Bulgarian media had been trying to incite acts  of violence against the Macedonian population in Pirin Macedonia  [part of Bulgaria]. The program of the Ilinden OMO that has  been announced demands a status of political, cultural, and  economic autonomy for Pirin Macedonia. The program envisages  the introduction of the Macedonian language into school  curriculums and local administration, an independent Macedonian  church, a ban on foreign propaganda regarding assimilation and  economic independence, and the withdrawal of the Bulgarian  occupation troops. According to Ivanov, the Ilinden OMO, on  whose membership composition he declined to comment, is financed  independently from membership dues, but that it was considering  appealing to the government and the mass media for aid in the  future. At the same time, it was stated that the Ilinden OMO,  although not legally registered at the court, will sue the media  for their insults and offenses against the organization.</p>

			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Justinian: Leaning on the Bar The legal profession is finally realising how remiss it has been in tackling discrimination against women practitioners - and not before time. If the profession has been even more neglectful about its attitude to ethnic minorities, its indifference to female contribution to the law is infinitely of longer standing. The Law Society's publication last week of a consultative document on new anti-discriminatory measures is designed to alert the profession to the importance which it must attach to the question of discrimination. Significantly, the governing body of solicitors wishes to elevate its current guidelines on non-discriminatory policies and practices to the status of rules enforceable through the profession's disciplinary code. The existing principle of non-discrimination should, it states, be extended to impose a policy on solicitors which will be directed specifically at eliminating discrimination. This would focus on current practices on recruitment and career advancement. The nature of discrimination against women differs significantly from discrimination against members of the ethnic minorities. Whereas blacks and Asians appear to suffer very serious discrimination at the point of recruitment as trainee solicitors, women encounter disadvantages later in their careers; this is most common following temporary withdrawal from practice because of pregnancy. More worrying still is the comparative failure of women solicitors to become partners. Some of the large firms of solicitors still do not possess a female partner. There is considerable statistical evidence suggesting that while women do achieve partnerships, they only do so at a significantly slower rate than their male counterparts. Other evidence, not all anecdotal, reveals that women interviewed for partnerships are often asked improper questions on their marital prospects and whether they intend to start a family. Similar experiences from women who seek to practice at the Bar have long been a source of justified criticism of the profession. Barrister Helena Kennedy's recently published book entitled Eve was Framed is testimony to what she proclaims is the treatment of women as 'a paradigm of the faults and blindnesses of the legal system'. In an earlier work, published in 1978, Ms Kennedy wrote, that 'nothing of any significance has been done to counter discrimination against women, and as a result women are playing little or no part in the creation and interpretation of laws affecting men and women alike'. Discrimination against women over the years has been a tent peg to secure the status quo ante. It is as powerful as a legal precedent in inhibiting change. The present movement to rid the profession of its discriminatory habits is healthy enough but the legacy of the past leaves a mark on the contemporary legal scene. The first woman barrister was appointed in 1922; the first woman solicitor also qualified in the same year. It took another 40 years before a woman became a county court judge; three years later the first woman made it to the High Court bench. But that was hardly the herald of a new era. Only five more women have since been appointed as High Court judges. No woman has yet become a law lord and out of a complement of 27 judges on the Court of Appeal there is only one woman. Of some 90 High Court judges only three are women. Judges are appointed mainly from among the leading barristers. Out of 628 practising Queen's Counsel only 29 (4 per cent) are female. In spite of this comparative paucity of women barristers from whom to select today's judiciary there is a case for positive discrimination by the Lord Chancellor. Equally pressing for the profession is its treatment of people from the ethnic minorities. Last week's consultative document also laid down proposals for new measures to deal with racial discrimination. The Law Society took its first steps to tackle racial discrimination in 1988 when it introduced a code of practice to address increasing evidence that black students were finding it more difficult than their white counterparts to secure articles (training with a firm of solicitors). At the same time, black barristers complained that white solicitors were declining to brief them. Black barristers' reliance on work from black and Asian solicitors was in danger of establishing a form of professional apartheid; and that is what, in effect, happened with the establishment of a Society of Black Lawyers. Since then the number of complaints has not diminished. Last year the Law Society received 85 allegations of racial discrimination from students. The Society of Black Lawyers' recently published report based on a survey of its members supports these findings. An industrial tribunal recently found a firm of solicitors guilty of discrimination on racial grounds against an applicant who wanted to become a trainee solicitor. The tribunal criticised the firm's selection procedures for trainees; the tribunal also indicated how a firm could unintentionally infringe race relations laws. The Law Society now proposes to reinforce its code by developing equal opportunities policies. The proposals realistically recognise that racial discrimination cannot be instantly eliminated. But if appropriately implemented the new measures should reassure ethnic minorities that they - like their female colleagues - are not being neglected in the ultimate search for proper representation in the provision of legal services.</p>

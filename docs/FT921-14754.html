			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Aerospatiale Mme Cresson is doubtless still smarting from Brussels' decision to veto the Franco-Italian takeover of de Havilland. But she has obviously not forgotten that Sir Leon Brittan also gave his blessing to Credit Lyonnais' participation in Usinor Sacilor, and is expected to approve BNP's FF1.25bn capital injection for Air France. It is only natural to assume that yesterday's confirmation of talks between Aerospatiale and an unidentified French bank is the prelude to a similarly controversial deal. With state owned engine-maker Snecma also renewing a request for outside funds, pressures on the economie mixte look to be intensifying. In the Snecma case private or foreign shareholders have not been ruled out. In the state-owned insurance sector, rules restricting private shareholders to 25 per cent have been relaxed. But, as with airlines and steel, the solution for the aerospace and defence group seems likely to involve an equity link to a state-owned bank. There are plenty of reasons why Aerospatiale requires fresh funds at this stage: the impact of French defence cuts, the cash requirements of its helicopter, regional aircraft and Airbus joint ventures, and the proposed development of the A319 airliner. Given its pivotal position in European alliances - and the speedier reaction this side of the Atlantic to changed military circumstances - there may also be a commercial case for making such an investment. The question is whether its new state-inspired partner will be able to arrive at commercially sensible terms.</p>

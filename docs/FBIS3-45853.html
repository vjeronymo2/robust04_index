The  meeting summed up the results of combat against corruption in  units directly under the provincial authorities and made  arrangements for the next step in combatting corruption.  Provincial party Secretary Guan Guangfu expressed four ideas on  further implementing central anticorruption instructions and  carrying forward the province's anticorruption struggle.    Guan Guangfu said: The year 1994 is a year of reform in our  province, a year of making endeavors, a year of implementing  policies, and a year of clean administration. Party  organizations in all localities throughout the province should  strive to bring about a great change in party style and in  practicing cleangovernment. This year of clean administration  indicates the provincial party committee's determination to curb  corruption and its utmost concern for anticorruption and clean  administration.    Guan Guangfu pointed out: The deeper we carry out reform and  opening up, the more necessary it is for us to combat corruption  and practice clean administration. This gives expression to the  nature of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.  Reform in the last 15 years has proved that only when  corruption is severely curbed can we ensure the smooth carrying  out of reform and construction. [passage omitted] This year is  an extraordinary year, in which we face very arduous tasks.  Whether or not all tasks can be implemented properly depends on  whether or not leaders at all levels can cultivate a good mental  attitude and a solid work style in organizing the masses for the  fulfillment of all these tasks. [passage omitted]    Guan Guangfu requested: The current three anticorruption  tasks should be further implemented so as to spend the Spring  Festival happily in a clean atmosphere. To put it more  specifically, there is a need for leading cadres to perform  better in practicing clean administration and self-control, to  increase momentum in cracking major and important cases, and to  severely curb malpractices. Because the Spring Festival is  approaching, we must increase the momentum of the fight against  corruption. First, we must reduce meetings and commendation  activities; unnecessary meetings must not be held and necessary  meetings must be held in a simple way; second, no public money  can be used for extravagant eating and drinking; third, the  offering of gift money and gift checks is prohibited; fourth,  the higher authorities, particularly institutions directly under  the provincial authorities, are not allowed to accept native or  special products offered by their subordinates; fifth, no public  money can be used for highly expensive entertainment.    Guan Guangfu stressed: Institutions directly under the  provincial authorities should play an exemplary role in the  combat against corruption. The current fight against corruption  is focused on party and government institutions, an law  enforcement, administration, and economic management  departments. Taking the province as a whole, attention should  first be paid to institutions directly under the provincial  authorities. [passage omitted]    In conclusion, Guan Guangfu requested: It is necessary to  fundamentally resolve corruption and carry out long-term  struggles against corruption. The fight against corruption is a  prolonged task and involves comprehensive social systems  engineering, which requires first, education, and second, law,  for its thorough resolution. In the course of curbing  corruption, there is a need to increase the momentum in cracking  major cases, to gradually eliminate the ground and conditions  for the emergence of corruption. At present, we must stress the  following: First, we must pay attention to education, the  implementation of regulations and policies, the improvement of  structures, and the implementation of supervision and  management, which all involve the overall situation; second, all  levels of party committees and governments should strengthen  their leadership, put the fight against corruption on their  agenda and pay constant attention to it; and third, we must  support discipline inspection work.    Ding Fengying, secretary of the provincial discipline  inspection commission, also spoke at the meeting. Vice Governor  Li Daqiang chaired the meeting.

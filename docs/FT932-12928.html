			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / All Nippon Airways plans to cut dividend ALL NIPPON Airways (ANA), Japan's largest airline, is planning to cut its dividend in the face of the downturn in the international and Japanese airline markets. The airline expects to report sharply lower net profits of around Y3bn (Pounds 17m) for the year ended March, 1993, against a profit of Y7.6bn previously. Profits are expected to remain under pressure during the next two years, Mr Isao Yagi, ANA's corporate planning director, said. Mr Taiji Kameyama, ANA's head of international relations, warned the dividend was likely to be trimmed. 'It represented 10 per cent of the face value of the shares last year; this percentage will most probably be reduced this year,' he said. The airline is embarking on rationalisation and cost-cutting, including increased use of aircraft leasing, the reduction in the annual intake of new recruits, the possible hiring for the first time of lower-cost foreign cabin attendants, and the redeployment of corporate headquarters staff to sales and marketing functions. Faced with a Y10bn increase in interest charges, the airline is reining back its 1991-95 capital spending programme from Y1,300bn to Y1,000bn, and is delaying the introduction of some new aircraft. The airline's international operations lost money last year while domestic operations were profitable. Empty seats, Page 19</p>

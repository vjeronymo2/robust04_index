			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Belgians prepare for 'short and sober' poll: The Euro-parliament election in Belgium won't take anyone's breath away On June 9 when Belgians cast their votes in the European elections the turnout will be high. Very high. Not because Belgians are fiercely interested in European affairs, nor particularly because they wish to pass judgment on the domestic government. The votes will pour in because Belgium is one of only three countries in the European Union where voting - whatever the election - is compulsory. So, like the young man lethargically cutting the grass in the capital's pretty Parc de Bruxelles (who had not even heard of the European elections), many Belgians will go to the polls simply to avoid paying a fine. 'I won't put anything on my paper,' he says. 'I'll pick it up and put it straight in the box.' The general indifference towards next month's elections is partly because the political parties have yet to launch their campaigns. There are no political hoardings and scant leafleting. With restrictions on how much the parties can spend on their campaigns now in place, the hustings are anyway likely to be 'short, sober and without any fuss', as the Libre Belgique newspaper put it yesterday. When the campaigns do begin, the election will be presented as more of a test for Belgium's political parties in the regions than for the two-year-old federal coalition government, in spite of opposition parties' inevitable attempts to dress up the elections as a 'national test'. The government has crawled back up the polls from a low-point last June when high unemployment, labour unrest and the European currency crisis sent support for the fragile coalition down to 18 per cent of the population. Rumours that Mr Jean Luc Dehaene would succeed Mr Jacques Delors as president of the European Commission have enhanced the Belgian prime minister's personal standing. In Wallonia, the French-speaking region of Belgium, the ruling Socialist party faces its first electoral test since three of its senior politicians were forced to resign their ministerial posts over alleged involvement in a shady arms deal with the Italian company Agusta. Support in the region has drifted down to around 30 per cent with Ecolo, the French-speaking Greens, expecting to capitalise most on the Socialists' disarray. In the Dutch-speaking Flanders region, the revamped Flemish Liberal Democrat party (VLD) is hoping to win more seats than the ruling CVP Christian Democrats - Mr Dehaene's party - which has been in power in Flanders since the Second World War. 'These may be European elections, but the national debate is more important than the European debate,' said Mr Willy De Clercq, a Belgian Euro-MP who represents the VLD. 'If we do well in these elections, and then repeat the score in October's local and provincial elections, that will put heavy pressure on the federal government.' In Brussels, Belgium's third region, the balance has also been disturbed by scandals. Here, the PSC, the French-speaking Christian Democrats, has lost most support as a result, although its descent has not been as sharp as the PS in Wallonia. One last source of interest will be the performance of the extreme right - represented by the Vlaams Blok in Flanders - reminiscent of South Africa's die-hard racist community - and by the National Front in Brussels and Wallonia. Although support for the extreme right has dwindled over the past year, one in 10 say they would support it in Brussels and Flanders, and one in 20 in Wallonia.</p>

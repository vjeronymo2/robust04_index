			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Jean-Christophe Cambadelis, national </F> secretary of the Socialist Party, PS, by Joseph Mace-Scaron:  "Cambadelis Hopes for `the Renaissance of a Great Movement'";  place and date not given]    [Text] Social transformation sessions. The national  secretary of the Socialist Party believes that we are witnessing  "the end of Balladurmania."    Will the left wing begin to recover from its bitter defeat  last March? It is expected that 742 prominent individuals,  ranging from Martine Aubry to Dominique Voynet, will publish an  appeal for the organization of social transformation sessions in  today's issue of LE MONDE.    The phrase used is a little obscure, but it is not likely to  conceal the ambitious nature of such an operation.    Although Jean-Christophe Cambadelis, one of the principal  artisans of these sessions, may deny it, this is indeed an  undertaking that will probably, in the long run, result in a new  unity on the left.    Already, the Socialists, of course, but also the  Communists--both orthodox and reform, the Ecologists, Radicals,  and representatives of the associative movements, as well as  trade-union leaders, have responded positively to this appeal.  In an initial phase, these sessions will involve the  organization of six demonstrations scheduled to take place in  the course of a circuit through France. The first, planned for 5  February in Paris, will have a question as its theme: "Why  change society?"    But this dynamic move toward unity has just been given a  major forward thrust by the repeal of the Falloux Law.    After all, the first event of these sessions will basically  take place....in the street. This will occur this coming 16  January when the leftist organizations hold their demonstration  "in defense of public education."    [Mace-Scaron] Can the left wing regain its unity in the  field? This coming 16 January, for example, with the  demonstration against the repeal of the Falloux Law?    [Cambadelis] The left wing certainly can do that, but this  is  not the issue. All of these forces and everyone who is committed  to public education, to schooling for all and to equal  opportunity, will mobilize. All republicans should be present.  By means of its attacks on public education, the government is  sacrificing the values of the Republic on the altar of  short-term electoral calculations. These values are secularism  and free education.    [Mace-Scaron] When you use the old formulas in this way, are  you not afraid of being criticized as "archaic?"    [Cambadelis] The spontaneous inclination of our society to  designate "socially disqualified individuals" can only be  counteracted by a deliberate policy of support for the right to  a second chance, to continued equality of opportunity. Because  these are the Republic's schools, schools that welcome children  without regard to their social origins, religion, or philosophy.  Whatever may be said about it, public education remains the  leading venue for social advancement, integration, and training  for citizenship.  <H5>  `The Rending of Our Society' </H5>   [Cambadelis continues] With the redirection of the effort  made toward private education, to the detriment of public  education, it is to the right of center that the archaic  attitudes are returning in force, accompanied by a more acute  risk of tearing our society apart.    We are witnessing the institutionalization of two  educational  networks financed by public funds, that is to say everyone's  money. One can easily see how the wealthier people and those  less fortunate are being separated.    [Mace-Scaron] Aren't you impressed by Mr. Balladur's  "know-how?"    [Cambadelis] Not at all. And I am obviously not the only  one.  Jacques Chirac even believes that the government is not going  far enough where the employment problem is concerned. He is not  wrong in his criticism, even though the policies he proposes for  correcting the situation are not those we advocate. But can one  support a government that is not moving in the right direction  on the unemployment issue? Paradoxically, following the vote of  confidence in Parliament, the prime minister has spoken much  more frequently in personal terms and has used more  superlatives. The machinery is seizing up, confidence is  dwindling, and appetites are growing keener. This is a sign of  the end of Balladurmania. The government is showing a lack of  imagination in dealing with unemployment, a lack of  determination with regard to the nationalist movements in  Europe, and a lack of tolerance where the problems of society  are concerned.    [Mace-Scaron] Aren't these social transformation sessions a  "remake" of the union of the left, with Dominique Voynet playing  Robert Fabre's role?    [Cambadelis] I doubt that Michel Rocard thinks he is  Francois  Mitterrand. It is not a question of drafting a joint program,  but of encouraging a debate on ideas in order to respond to the  expectations of the French people. Why, after having experienced  the disaster of unemployment, the collapse of Communism, the  rising tide of inequalities, the consolidation of nationalist  sentiments, the urgency of ecological needs, the biological  revolution, the triumph of humanitarianism, the party crisis,  etc., would anyone want us to return in 1994 to the strategy  defined in Epinay in 1971? We are living in a new era that  demands a situational review. Reading patterns have blurred and  political references and identification have been overturned or  thrown out of phase.    Following the General Assembly of the PS, we reaffirmed our  principles. New ideas have emerged, and internal life has  calmed. Now it is necessary to face up to all of this without  the desire to dominate. There can be no great movement in  society without the major debate on contradictory concepts that  must precede it. That is the price of the rebirth of a great  movement in search of change for our society.    [Mace-Scaron] Isn't it a little bit hypocritical to make it  appear that this operation is not being directed by the PS?    [Cambadelis] The PS has proposed, and the protagonists in  social transformation have disposed. Simply because Michel  Rocard contemplated the future, or because Lionel Jospin  sponsored this initiative--neither of these things makes the  sessions the property of the PS. The initial proposal has been  substantially enriched. Leaders in the ecological field have  altered its center of gravity by setting a deadline for social  change. Organizational leaders have refocused the sessions on  the daily concerns of the men and women of France. The friends  of Messrs. Herzog, Fiterman, and Rigout have tried to promote  debate on the remodeling issue.    The sponsors of these sessions, of whom a list is being  published today, are simply leaders who believe that the  transformation of society is necessary, and from this point of  view, they oppose the conservatism that is currently in power.  What is being sought is a discussion of the basics. The problems  of alliance and the electoral issues will not be taken up.    [Mace-Scaron] In two weeks, the PCF [French Communist Party]  will elect a new secretary general. Do you hope that he will be  more of an advocate of unity than Georges Marchais?    [Cambadelis] I would remind you that it was Georges  Marchais,  after all, who signed the joint program. I think that something  is happening in the Communist Party. In three weeks, our  arrangements will be made. As for the future of the Communists,  it belongs to them, and it is for them to decide. The  announcement that a leader at the top level will attend each of  the sessions made by Georges Marchais at the most recent meeting  of the PCF Central Committee shows that a transition from the  bunker strategy to that of debate may perhaps be under way.    [Mace-Scaron] Shouldn't the PS pursue an evaluation of the  achievements and failures of the left wing, analyzing the  reasons for the distortion of its economic policy or the  monarchic aspect the presidential institution has taken on?    [Cambadelis] As former minister Anicet Le Pors noted  recently, it is necessary to undertake a critical analysis of  what one has done and what one has been in order to make a new  start. The PS is therefore continuing its work of review, while  at the same time opening up new prospects. The younger  generation insists on this. I would refer, as evidence of this,  to the imminent publication of the book by Martine Aubry as well  as that by Pierre Moscovici.</p>

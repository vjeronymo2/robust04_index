			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Francisco Alves Filho: "Olive Green Belt"; </F> introductory paragraph in boldface as published]    [Text] The Army and the Military Police are occupying  the Roquete Pinto shantytown in a pilot operation to combat drug  trafficking in Rio de Janeiro.    The offensive began on 11 October. A gunfight between rival  gangs in the Roquete Pinto shantytown in Rio de Janeiro's  Northern Zone resulted in shots being fired at the Army's 24th  Armored Infantry Battalion and wounding a sentinel. In response,  the military unleashed a major operation in cooperation with  Federal, Military, and Civil Police to get rid of the  traffickers controlling day-to-day life in the neighborhood. The  assault resulted in one dead and eight wounded, with 28 suspects  ending up in jail--and it should have ended there. It should  have, but it did not. Since then, Army soldiers and officers  have taken charge of the fight against drug trafficking in the  shantytown as part of what is considered a pilot project that  may be extended to other parts of the city. Without fanfare, the  military occupation of Rio de Janeiro's shantytowns has begun.    "The Roquete Pinto shantytown has become a training camp and  school for soldiers of the Armed Forces," explains Colonel Paulo  Cesar Costa de Oliveira of the Rio de Janeiro Military Police,  who has been appointed to coordinate the joint operation by  state police and the Army. "Once the work in that locality is  well established, I am going to ask that they occupy the Vigario  Geral and Parada de Lucas shantytowns." So far, the objectives  of the operation have been achieved. The traffickers have been  routed, the shantytown mapped out, and the residents registered.  But perhaps the chief success has been the trust instilled in  the residents by the military. "The atmosphere here has changed  from water to wine; things are calm," swears Denilson de Melo,  19, who has headed the local residents association since the  president-elect, Gilberto Silva, was arrested a month ago on  charges of helping the traffickers. "Now on hot days, I can  sleep in the flagstone courtyard at my house, which used to be  occupied by `fireworks kids' (boys who set off fireworks to  alert traffickers to the arrival of police or a shipment of  drugs)." Melo believes that the entire Roquete Pinto community  gives the action by the federal troops its unconditional support.    Upon taking charge of policing the area, the Army's first  step was to map all the alleys and side streets in Roquete Pinto  and assign numbers to them. It then began registering the  residents. Using its prerogative under the Constitution, the  Army relieved the state police of their duty to combat  trafficking in the region and began making two daily incursions  into the shantytown. The last step was to close off access by  sea, since Roquete Pinto is located on the shores of Guanabara  Bay. The process of issuing identification papers to fishermen  will be completed within a few days, after which only those  living in the locality will be allowed to enter. The entire  operation has the support of the Special Service, whose agents  have infiltrated the shantytown to provide information.    From the children to the older residents, everyone has only  praise for the soldiers. "For the first few days, people were  afraid, thinking that this might become a military stronghold,  but it was the opposite that happened," says Severina Santos,  45, who owns a bar in the shantytown. "Now we can move about in  the streets at any hour without being afraid that bad things  will happen to us," she adds with an air of satisfaction. The  "bad things" to which Severina is referring are not limited  solely to crimes committed by the traffickers: they also include  arbitrary acts by military police officers from the 16th  Battalion, who were previously responsible for patrolling the  area. "They are hated by the community because they were in the  habit of assaulting innocent workers and invading the shacks of  honest people instead of pursuing criminals," says the president  of the residents association.    According to Melo, one reason why the shantytown residents  support the Army's action is precisely that it has eliminated  the control that PM [Military Police] soldiers used to exercise  over the residents. Even the children agree. "The police were  always beating us up for no reason, saying that we were acting  as runners (delivering drugs), and one time one of them took my  bicycle," commented eight-year-old L. To establish closer  relations with the residents, the 24th Armored Infantry  Battalion has stepped up the medical care that it has been  providing at the Community Center for the past two years. That  center is now being used as a kind of base for the troops in the  shantytown. "I hope they never leave here," says the president  of the residents association.    As a result of the increase in crime in Rio de Janeiro, and  especially since the slaughter in the Vigario Geral shantytown,  the idea of making federal troops responsible for policing the  state has brought the Left and the Right together in a  surprising consensus. On the day following the massacre, Federal  Deputy Sergio Arouca (PPS [Popular Socialist Party], Rio de  Janeiro), who was once a member of the Brazilian Communist  Party, took the floor in the Chamber of Deputies to demand  federal intervention in Rio de Janeiro's Military Police,  although he does not support an isolated action like that in the  Roquete Pinto shantytown. In a newspaper article, sociologist  Herbert de Souza ("Betinho") appealed to Governor Leonel Brizola  (PDT [Democratic Labor Party]) to request the "immediate and  urgent cooperation of the Armed Forces." Even Mayor Cesar Maia  (PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party]) endorsed the idea.    Those appeals did not surprise Army commanders. In a  document  drawn up by the War College [ESG] in 1989 and titled "Structure  of National Power for the Year 2000," such a situation had  already been foreseen by the formulators of military strategies.  The document predicted that "at the start of the coming  century," a "contingent of dropouts, criminals, and even  murderers" would be harassing the state police forces to such an  extent that the latter would "ask the Armed Forces to help by  taking over the tough task of confronting that horde of outlaws,  neutralizing them, and even destroying them so that law and  order can be maintained."    Although total disorder was not expected until the year  2000,  members of the Army High Command began in mid-1992 to draw up a  plan for occupying Rio de Janeiro's shantytowns, calling it  Operation "Diamond." The plan was even tested in brief and  secret exercises conducted in cooperation with the Military  Police, but the possibility of its actually being put into  effect was repeatedly denied by military authorities. But in  October, Operation "Diamond" did indeed take effect. Without any  fanfare, the Army has stopped drug trafficking in the Roquete  Pinto shantytown, and its action may be extended to other  localities. The Armed Forces have their sights set chiefly on  Borel Hill, whereas the Military Police would prefer to have  military help in Vigario Geral and Parada de Lucas.    Although the commanding officer of the 24th Armored Infantry  Battalion declines to discuss the Army's situation in the  Roquete Pinto shantytown, the unit's deputy commanding officer,  Lieutenant Colonel Themistocles Leao Filho, has written an  article on the subject for the next issue of OMBRO A OMBRO, a  newspaper aimed at military readers. In his article, Leao  criticizes officers who supported more vigorous action in the  shantytown after the traffickers fired at the barracks. "Some  comrades have been heaping severe criticism on us for not  sending in armored units and firing away until not one stone was  left on top of another," the lieutenant colonel comments. "Once  again, without getting carried away and without heroics or  insane actions, the mission was accomplished and is being  accomplished," he says. "Since that time, we have been in the  shantytown registering people, supporting them, and patrolling  the area."    Unconcerned with the ESG's strategic theories, the residents  of Roquete Pinto are again experiencing peace. The soccer fields  once used by rival gangs of traffickers are again being visited  regularly by children. The troops no longer frighten  anyone--quite the contrary. The soldiers are winning fans in the  shantytown. "They are cute," says Marcia Ribeiro, 16.</p>

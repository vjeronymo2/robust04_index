			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / US unveils plans for sanctions against N Korea The US last night outlined its proposals for phased United Nations sanctions intended to persuade North Korea to accept international inspection of its nuclear facilities. Ms Madeleine Albright, Washington's ambassador to the UN, who is consulting with other members of the Security Council on joint action, said the measures would be 'carefully calibrated'. 'The more they break the rules, the tougher the sanctions: there is an equation there,' she said. The US initiative came as Pyongyang warned of a 'pitiless war' if the UN imposed sanctions and as former US president Jimmy Carter began a mediation mission in an attempt to ease tension. Mr Carter was reported to have held talks with North Korea's President Kim Il-sung after a reception hosted by the foreign minister. The US draft resolution proposes a first stage of sanctions including a mandatory arms embargo. Other measures in this phase would be: a halt to technical and scientific co-operation; a cut-off of UN economic aid; voluntary reduction of diplomatic ties; a ban on air traffic except for passenger flights and on commercial and cultural exchanges. The draft calls for a grace period after adopting the measures and before putting them into effect. Only if Pyongyang ultimately continued to be intransigent would the Security Council approve a second phase of sanctions including cutting off financial transactions. Thus, the administration appears to have abandoned, at least for now, a proposal by Mr Robert Gallucci, US assistant secretary of state, to block remittances sent home by North Koreans in Japan. Estimates have placed these as high as Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1.05bn) a year, Pyongyang's principal source of hard currency. Mr Gallucci said the North yesterday continued to permit routine monitoring by inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency at its Yongbyon reactor, despite having informed the IAEA, the UN's nuclear watchdog, that it was withdrawing from the organisation. South Korea yesterday sought to calm the war scare that has affected the country's financial markets. President Kim Young-sam told financial leaders there was no cause for alarm. The Seoul bourse general share index yesterday fell by 12.80 points, or 1.4 per cent, to 890.92 after suffering a 2.1 per cent decline on Tuesday. UK urged to push for total test ban, Page 4</p>

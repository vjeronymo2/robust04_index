			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Arts: Bargains from the belly-up - Art Fairs AFTER the worst summer in the memory of even the oldest antique dealer the art trade is attempting to find new hope in the autumn fairs which are now underway. Chelsea is the place to buy a bargain this weekend. The Old Town Hall is taken over by the Chelsea Antiques Fair which, in its 72nd successive year, is the oldest in the land, while along the road at Chelsea Harbour interior decorators, who have suffered badly in the last two years, are huddled together for support. But the real test comes next week when the first major specialist fair of the new season, the 20th Century British Art, fills the Royal College of Art for five days. This is the sector which has been hit hardest by the recession. Six of last year's 52 exhibitors have since stopped trading, including such major names as David Messum and Trinity. And although their places have been filled by the likes of Agnews and Berkeley Square Gallery, there will be a feeling of apprehension when the doors open on Wednesday. Colin Phipps of Austin Desmnond &amp; Phipps, who is chairing the Fair's advisory committee, reckons that prices will be marked down around 25 per cent on a year ago. And then the haggling starts. You could say that now is an excellent time to buy that Matthew Smith, or the Tristan Hillier that has been quite out of your price range since the speculative boom of the late 1980s. But it is possible that prices could go even lower if more major dealers go belly-up, forced by the short sighted banks to put their stock on a weak market via the auction houses. Even so serious collectors now have the pick of an attractive crop of pictures, not only from distress sales but because dealers are now being forced to dispose of the works that they previously held back for their private delectation. It could be the best fair for buyers for some time. There are sales taking place. Phipps own gallery has disposed of five paintings by Ivan Hitchens in recent months. Three years ago they would each have averaged Pounds 30,000; now they were going for around Pounds 18,000. It is interesting where they came from. One was from stock, one was acquired at auction (or rather after the auction for a bargain price), one came from another dealer, and two came from clients desperate to cash in their art. Strangely, while the impulse buyer, prepared to pay up to Pounds 1,000 for a painting, has disappeared, and the big punter splashing out over Pounds 50,000 is very rare, the old fashioned art addicts are still happy to spend around Pounds 20,000 acquiring the painting that they have always lusted after. And these tend to be the more challenging works: it is the simple decorative paintings that have become virtually unsaleable. The 20th Century Fair usually does well. Highlights this year include sculpture, priced from Pounds 300 to Pounds 5,000 on Gillian Jason's stand; John Bellany has created prints for the first time, on offer at Berkeley Square; Julian Hartnoll is showing the late John Bratby; while Michael Parkin and Agnews are both selling Sickert. Most of the major post-1900 British artists will be available, priced at 1986 values.</p>

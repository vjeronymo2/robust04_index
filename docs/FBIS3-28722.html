Officially just over 929,000 Australians are out of work, down  by a little over 8,000 for the month. Linda Mottram reports the  new figures also show another 22,000 Australians found work in  January.    [Begin Mottram recording] The January figures from the  Australian Bureau of Statistics defied a columnist's prediction  that there could be a slight rise in the jobless rate. Instead,  there was a fall of 0.1 percent from December to 10.6 percent in  January. It is the third successive monthly fall in the  unemployment rate. Most significantly, the numbers of men  seeking full-time jobs fell by almost 12,500 but a longer term  measure of the trend in the unemployment rate continues to be  flat at 10.8 percent. The figures also show a slight rise in  the participation rate, that is the combined number of people  with jobs and officially registered as looking for work,  indicating renewed confidence among job seekers about their  prospects in the work force. The figures also give the new year  school leavers their search measure of the state of the job  market. [end recording]</p>

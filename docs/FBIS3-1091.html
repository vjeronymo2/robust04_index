The results were taken from seven constituencies where the  opposition won in the 20 February elections.    The RPT, which obtained 35 seats (out of 81), accuses the  opposition of having organized "massive fraud" and "preventing  voters from casting their votes" in seven constituencies out of  the 24 concerned in the second round of legislative elections.    According to the official election results, proclaimed by  the  Supreme Court on 14 March, the Togolese opposition won an  absolute majority at the National Assembly, with 43 seats out of  81.    In his statement during the proclamation of the results,  Supreme Court President Emmanuel Apedoh said that the election  "went smoothly in line with the established procedure and in a  satisfactory manner."    That opinion was shared by France, Germany, and the United  States (three of the five member countries of the International  Monitoring Committee on the Togolese elections) and the European  Union.    According to the electoral code, the Supreme Court has, as  of  today, has 10 days to rule on the appeal.</p>

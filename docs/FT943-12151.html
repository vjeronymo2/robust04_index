			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Poles suspend steel strike Workers at Poland's Huta Warszawa-Lucchini steelworks, 51 per cent owned by Italy's Lucchini group, have suspended a seven-week sit-in strike after management agreed to pay talks. A strike leader said: 'We decided that it would be unwise to keep striking during talks and the workers accepted this point of view.' Lucchini's decision to drop the issue of the strike's legality had opened a way to agreement. The strikers are demanding a 30 per cent pay rise and rapid modernisation of the mill, claiming delays in investment have prevented productivity increasing and eroded their earnings.</p>

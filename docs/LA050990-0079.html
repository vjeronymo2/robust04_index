			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: PICTURES TELL STORY OF ORLANDO STREAK;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: NOTRE DAME SECOND BASEMAN GOES SIX FOR SIX AFTER STUDYING OLD PHOTOS  OF HIMSELF.  </P> <P> In a flash, Vinnie Orlando of Notre Dame High has transformed himself from a  still life to a moving picture.  </P> <P> Orlando, a junior second baseman, recently developed a solution to his batting  problems. Part of the credit, he insists, belongs to a shutterbug, a parent of  one of his teammates, who captured him in action during a hot streak last  season.  </P> <P> Orlando noticed that the sequence of photos, which were taken during a  12-for-13 hitting barrage, showed him shifting his bat behind his head before  the pitcher's delivery. Actually, he was bouncing his bat off his shoulder  blade a few times to loosen his hands and prepare for the pitch.  </P> <P> Midway through this season Orlando was batting below .250. Two weeks ago,  frustrated with his limited output, he revived the tapping motion.  </P> <P> "I saw the picture and said, 'Hey, maybe that will work again,' " Orlando said.  "You get a rhythm going. It's just so I can get comfortable and get ready."  </P> <P> It seems a rather picayune adjustment, but since Orlando's been tapping, he's  been rapping.  </P> <P> Orlando tied a Southern Section record for most hits in a game last week  against Harvard with six -- three singles, two doubles and a home run. Indeed,  Orlando pounded three two-run homers last week.  </P> <P> In all, Orlando was 10 for 14 with 10 runs batted in as Notre Dame beat Palos  Verdes, Harvard, La Salle and Alemany.  </P> <P> "The ball just looked like a basketball up there," Orlando said after his  six-for-six outing. "I wasn't trying to get hits, I was just trying to put the  ball hard somewhere and if they fall, they fall."  </P> <P> Since he started tapping, Orlando is 13 for 19 and has raised his average to  .372. He has driven in 22 runs and stolen 19 of 20 bases this season.  </P> <P> "The first time we faced him, it looked like he was trying to pull the ball,"  said Alemany Coach Jim Ozella, whose team fell, 9-5, on Saturday and  surrendered two hits to Orlando. "This time he was trying to use the whole  field. He'll be a lot more successful that way."  </P> <P> Now, Orlando pines to swing.  </P> <P> "He just wants to be up there," Notre Dame Coach Bob Mandeville said. "Instead  of warming up before a game he's just kinda standing there holding that bat.  </P> <P> "He's capable of hitting like this all the time. He's just relaxing, that's the  key."  </P></p>

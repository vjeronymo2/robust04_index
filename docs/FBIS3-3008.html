			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 16 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier  and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said today that neither the  export of prison labor products nor immigration should become  conditions for extending China's MFN status.    There are a lot of such issues, they should not be played up  or played down for political needs, Qian said, and China hopes  both sides adopt a realistic attitude towards addressing these  issues.    Qian made the remarks when responding to a question at a  press conference here sponsored by Zhou Jue, spokesman for the  current session of the Eighth National People's Congress.    On the export of prison labour products, Qian said that even  the United States acknowledges that its prison labour products  are exported to some countries. The U.S. side, however, does  not want prison labour products from other countries to enter  the United States, Qian said.    Qian said China has a big market and it is entirely possible  for China not to export its prison labour products to the United  States. Moreover, the issue has already been settled.    On the question of immigration freedom in relation to MFN  status, Qian said that again this is not a problem as far as the  Chinese side is concerned. Even the U.S. side acknowledges that  China does not place obstacles to large scale immigration to the  United States. The obstacle now is that those who are found with  an intention of immigration are denied the visa to the United  States.    What is more. Qian said, China has the problem of illegal  immigration, and "we are discussing ways to solve the problem."</p>

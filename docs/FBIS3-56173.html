			<p>Language: <F P=105> Azeri </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Address by President Geydar Aliyev to army officers </F> assigned to fronts on 13 January; place not given -- recorded]    [Excerpts] On my instructions, the Azerbaijani Chief of  General Staff organized a meeting with a group of officers  serving in Baku, in military commissariats and other military  units.    The purpose of our meeting was this: The process of forming  the Azerbaijani Army has been going on in our republic for the  last few months. And, you are witness to the fact that this  process is going in the correct direction and positive results  are being achieved. All these things contribute to the  improvement of the Azerbaijani Republic's defenses and armed  forces. [passage omitted]    I can now happily note that the work of forming an army is  speedily progressing in Azerbaijan, our military units are  taking shape, our armed forces are working to create a regular  army, and the measures we have taken have started giving  results. The existing army units that are in the battle zones  are befittingly displaying their military potential and power  [words indistinct].    You are already aware of the changes taking place in recent  months. You are all officers serving in the Azerbaijani army.  The changes in recent months are obvious, these being:  Disciplined military units are being created in our army, and  many have already been created; and in those regions where they  defend Azerbaijan on Azerbaijan's own territory, these units are  giving a deserving reply to the Armenian armed forces,  inflicting extremely heavy blows to them, and are reliably  defending Azerbaijan's territory.    The fighting and warfare is continuing. The war is being  waged by the Armenian Armed Forces against the Azerbaijani  Republic. I already said that a portion of our land has been  occupied, and the Armenian Armed Forces still believe that by  occupying more territory they can impose their conditions on  Azerbaijan. If they previously had some chance of achieving  this objective, now they no longer have a chance to do so. The  Azerbaijan Army units facing the Armenian Armed Forces are  reliably defending our lands all along the front. In so doing,  they are undoubtedly waging battles and, as I already said, they  are striking hard at the Armenian Armed Forces.    You know that as a result of these battles some of the  occupied Azerbaijani lands have returned to the control of the  Azerbaijani Army -- that is, these lands have been recovered and  the Azerbaijani Army units are now courageously trying to regain  the rest of the occupied lands.    These are bloody battles. Our Azerbaijan Republic's brave,  heroic sons, our soldiers and officers in the army, all our  fighters -- and I note this with satisfaction -- are fighting  heroically, and they are being killed and wounded. But I want  to note that henceforth superiority rests with the Azerbaijani  Army in these battles, and enormous losses have been inflicted  on the Armenian Armed Forces as a result of these heavy blows.  They are suffering heavy losses in men and material every day  and are being defeated.    All these developments are exacerbating the situation on the  borders. Again it is the Armenian side that is responsible for  this exacerbation. You are aware that I have frequently stated  that we want an end to the war, the fighting, and to hold peace  talks. I have put forward proposals and made statements in this  direction. However, the Armenian side is not in accord with  this, and sometimes they put forward conditions that we  undoubtedly cannot accept.    Therefore, the Armenian side and the Armenian Armed Forces  are culpable and responsible for all the ongoing fighting and  the war, whereas we are fighting to defend our own lands and  homeland.    Inevitably, as the fighting intensified in this manner we  felt a need for measures to further mobilize our forces. In  this context, the Azerbaijani youth are now applying to serve in  the army with high spirits. The situation is no longer the same  as previously, when there were a considerable number of  desertions from the army. Now, as you know, after my address to  the nation on 2 November there was an upsurge in patriotism  among all the citizens, especially the youth and those able to  serve in the army. They are coming to the military  commissariats and military units of their own volition to enter  the fight and serve in the army. [passage omitted]    Our officer cadres at the fronts are fittingly fulfilling  their duties, and displaying excellent heroism. However, our  officers should be even closer to the war front and should be  active there and serve there.    The Defense Ministry leadership informed me that the  officers  gathered here will be sent to the military units. Maybe most of  the officers here are serving in the military commissariats and  in army units deployed in Baku, but now you should continue your  service in the military units at the battlefronts. [passage  omitted]    You are officers in the military service, which has an  unbreakable law that says that any serviceman serves where he is  assigned by the homeland and army command. You all know this,  so you should comply with the orders you will receive today, and  I hope that you will go to the fronts, serve in the army units  there and thus enhance Azerbaijan's defensive potential and  contribute your share to the defense and recovery of our lands.  [passage omitted]    I wish you success and hope that you will all go to the  front  and display heroism. That is all I have to say. God help you  in your glorious work, and I hope that you will honorably  discharge the orders given to you by the homeland. We are  waging a war for the homeland, for the defense of our homeland,  and you are active participants in this war for the homeland.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report based on BNS (expansion unknown) </F> materials under the "Inquiry" rubric: "A Traitor Has Sneaked  Into the Lithuanian Security Service. Prosecutor's Office  Promises To Expose Him"]    [Text] The Lithuanian Prosecutor's Office plans to conduct  "a thorough investigation" to find out who was responsible for  the failure of the operation to detain Vitaliy Yegorov, former  Soviet serviceman, who was charged with anti-state activity in  Klaipeda during the August 1991 coup attempt. At the time,  Colonel Yegorov was chief of the military-political department  of the USSR Coast Guard Division deployed in the city. The  Lithuanian Prosecutor's Office has evidence proving that it was  at his initiative that the Soviet military in Klaipeda announced  their assumption of authority and demanded that State of  Emergency Committee edicts be adhered to during the August coup  plot. This is why Yegorov has long been wanted and a warrant to  arrest him has been issued.    It was planned to detain the suspect last Friday in his  apartment in Klaipeda, where his wife and children live, but to  all appearances he was warned in advance about the upcoming  action and fled.    "This is an outright sellout by a staffer of the National  Security Service," Kiastutis Biatingis, chief prosecutor from  the department for the investigation of state crimes, said in an  interview for the RESPUBLIKA newspaper. "It is possible that  Yegorov was detained on Friday, but he may have been released  later. He may also have been warned in advance about the  upcoming operation. To all appearances, someone did that  deliberately."    According to Biatingis, the Lithuanian National Security  Service was the sole agency tasked with carrying out the  operation to detain Vitaliy Yegorov. He said that he would  officially demand that security service staffers who failed to  perform their duties be discharged.    A shadow of suspicion also falls on National Security  Service  chief Jurgis Jurgialis himself. Lithuanian General Prosecutor  Arturas Paulauskas said that in the last few days before the  operation, Jurgialis had called him a number of times and argued  insistently that the former Soviet serviceman should not be  detained because this action would look politically dubious. As  a result, Mr. Jurgialis has been missing at his work place since  28 February. According to his secretary, he has the flu.</p>

			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Cambodian sacking greeted with dismay Less than a week after the Cambodian government launched a Dollars 1m (Pounds 666,000) campaign to attract foreign investors, the architect of the country's economic reform programme, Mr Sam Rainsy, finance minister, was sacked in a Cabinet reshuffle yesterday. His removal from office was greeted with dismay by Cambodians and nervousness by potential investors and donors, impressed by Mr Rainsy's vision for the development of the war-ravaged economy. 'This is a real shame,' said one foreign businessman in Phnom Penh. 'Sam Rainsy has undoubtedly been the best of all the people I've had to deal with in this government.' King Norodom Sihanouk, who rules Cambodia's 7m people, evidently shared this view. In recent letters of support for Mr Rainsy, he said: 'Our nation and our people greatly need your highly patriotic and competent services'. A large majority in Cambodia's National Assembly voted in favour of the shake-up after it was presented for approval by the senior prime minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh. He said the changes were aimed at forging greater unity among parties in the ruling coalition which is largely comprised of royalists and former Communists. Before returning to Cambodia to join the government, Mr Rainsy had spent 27 years in France, where he worked as an accountant and stockbroker. He gave that up for a government salary of Dollars 30 a month. Mr Rainsy appears to have been a victim of his own success. His popularity among voters at home and the stature he had gained abroad worried his political masters, who thought him a threat. His determination to root out endemic corruption also made him many enemies in the government, the private sector and in the armed forces. A western diplomat said: 'Let's face it, if you're serious about a Cabinet reshuffle, there are lots more obvious candidates for the chop'. In a reflection of local business concerns, there was steady buying of gold by investors, mostly Chinese, on the 24-hour foreign exchange-precious metals market in Phnom Penh. When Mr Rainsy assumed the portfolio in July last year, he inherited what he liked to describe as 'a free-for-all jungle economy', which had failed to recover from the economic ruin wrought by the Khmer Rouge regime in the 1970s and a subsequent decade of mismanagement. He was determined to dismantle the cumbersome state apparatus of a crumbling centrally-planned economy and reintegrate Cambodia with the global economy. He stressed fiscal prudence and accountability, and pinned his hopes on private entrepreneurship and the free market. In a recent interview with the Financial Times, he said: 'My vision consists of seeing Cambodia become part of the east Asian economic miracle. I hope that within 10 or 15 years we will catch up with our neighbouring countries'. If the international and multilateral donors who listened to his message thought Mr Rainsy a touch optimistic, they enthusiastically bought his line. After he addressed a donors' meeting in Tokyo in March, Dollars 500m was pledged towards national reconstruction. This came on top of the Dollars 1bn pledged by donors after the Cambodian Peace Agreement in Paris two years ago. The foreign business community has been equally impressed by Mr Rainsy's efforts to create a more stable environment for foreign investment. His record, after just one year, is impressive. He was behind the Foreign Investment Law, passed in July. He helped to control inflation, stabilised the Cambodian currency, the Riel, centralised revenue collection and brought the government's huge deficit under control. The question now is whether his successor can protect the policies Mr Rainsy set in place. He is Mr Keat Chhon, a French-trained nuclear physicist, and, like many members of today's government, an erstwhile official with the former Khmer Rouge regime. For the past year, he has headed the Cambodian Development Council, whose remit is the promotion of foreign investment. Investors and diplomats are reserving judgment. One foreign businessman said: 'Keat Chhon's impressive, intelligent and capable. The next couple of months will be crucial from a business perspective. We'll all be watching and waiting'.</p>

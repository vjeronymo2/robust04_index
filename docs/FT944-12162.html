			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / FT Review of Business Books (18): Distilled experience - The industry still hasn't shrugged off its plastic daffodil image / Sales Promotion 'SALES PROMOTION IN POSTMODERN MARKETING' By Christian Petersen and Alan Toop Gower Publishing, Pounds 39.50, 192 pages The world of sales promotion ought to receive more serious critical attention. Sales promotion continues to account for a fast-growing share of corporate marketing budgets: already, we are told, a higher proportion than expenditure on media. Heinz, which has run effective promotions offering a free car a day for 100 days, probably had good reasons for recently announcing a shift of spending from TV to targeted promotions. Yet Hoover's free flights offer which sounded too good to be true failed because of confusion over the small print and inept administration. So what type of promotions work and when? Where is the evidence that promotional activities targeted at consumers through the letterbox, at the point of sale, via packaging, over the phone, even by fax, are more or less effective than press, poster and TV advertising? Some of the author's case material and examination of recent promotions is certainly illuminating. The sales promotion industry has come a long way, but still hasn't shrugged off its traditional plastic daffodil image. Outside the more vibrant specialist agencies, the business tends to be seen as tactical, but also peripheral, even ephemeral. Understandably, advertising agencies have blinkered views, suspicious of any techniques other than pure, powerful media advertising to build brand awareness and value. A good example of the switch, which reflects the impact of change in markets and marketing is that advertising league tables are no longer headed by the big brands, but by the powerful retail chains. The combined effect of competition from retailers' brands, pressure on margins and contributions to store groups' own advertising is clearly forcing more brand manufacturers to cut back on advertising and look for leap-frogging promotional techniques with faster direct impact on sales. Surprisingly few 'insider' books have focused knowledgeably and objectively on sales promotion. Alan Toop and the late Christian Petersen both founded leading sales promotion consultancies, created some spectacular campaigns and wrote several of the more enlightening books on the practice. Their latest, Sales Promotion in Postmodern Marketing, examines the background, 'the golden age of marketing' - the 1950s to the 1970s - which saw the arrival of independent television, the assault of Madison Avenue commercials, the emergence of supermarkets followed by superstores, offering more and more shopping convenience, variety and choice. For example, the authors found more than 20 versions of Persil alone, 150 brands of cereal and more than 30 different toothpastes. Add typically huge selections of fruit and vegetables, bakery lines, meat and fish and drinks, plus, in more cases, in-store pharmacies, newsagents and dry cleaners, and it is clear that the concept of one-stop shopping has overtaken any earlier preference for small specialist shops. For brand manufacturers to elbow their way onto the crowded shelves, compete with own-labels and gain attention, the two overriding priorities became new product launches and line extensions for added shelf space, and sales promotions. One of the key differences between advertising and sales promotion, the authors explain, is that sales promotion invites participation or exhortation to act now. It encourages response whether the promotion takes the form of cash rebates, extra product free, coupons, contests or competitions, premiums, prizes or free samples. Even they find it surprising, however, that so little senior management time is paid to ensuring maximum impact for every penny spent in this area. The authors admit that sales promotion is still less well understood and less closely studied than advertising. It is one thing to claim expenditure on sales promotion and other below-the-line activities now exceeds spending on media advertising. Is it too much to offer evidence and analysis? The book offers a rich seam of distilled experience and fresh insights. What is still lacking is research and rationale.</p>

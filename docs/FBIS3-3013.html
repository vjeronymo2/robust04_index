"The central and western regions have great potential for  development," Zhu said. "How to develop their economies, how to  feed and clothe the poor there, how to help the local people get  rid of poverty, and how to realize common prosperity for them  all are important issues attracting world attention."    Zhu expressed the view when he joined deputies to the  National People's Congress from Shaanxi Province in a group  discussion on premier Li Peng's government work report.    Achievement of common prosperity and development of central  and western regions are an important component of Deng  Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, Zhu said.    With continued national economic growth and more revenues  for  the central government, he said, the central authorities will  increase investment in the central and western regions and  accelerate development there, he said.    Zhu called on the regions to continue developing their  agriculture as the foundation of their economies.    In developing their industry, he said, the regions should  not  "give up" on agriculture, in which he said they have a  comparative advantage.    The central authorities are adopting measures to narrow  "price scissors" between industrial and farm products to  increase peasants' income, he said.    "As prices for farm produce rise, the central and western  regions will get prosperous," he said.    The central and western regions should develop water  conservancy projects and infrastructure, especially transport  facilities for shipping their rich natural resources to the rest  of the country and onto the world market, he pointed out.</p>

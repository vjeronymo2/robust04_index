			<p><P> May 20, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SENATE CONFIRMS BONNER U.S. JUDGE, ELEVATES 2 JURISTS  </P> <P> The Senate on Thursday confirmed Los Angeles U.S. Atty. Robert C. Bonner as a  federal judge and two Los Angeles federal jurists as members of the U.S. 9th  Circuit Court of Appeals.  </P> <P> All three were first nominated by former President Ronald Reagan and  resubmitted by President Bush in February after the Senate's Democratic  majority decided to delay acting on most federal judgeship vacancies until  after the election.  </P> <P> The District Court judges elevated to the appeals court were Pamela Ann Rymer  and Ferdinand F. Fernandez. Bonner was confirmed to fill Rymer's seat on the  District Court.  </P> <P> Rymer, 48, has served on the federal bench in Los Angeles since 1983. Reagan  nominated her last year to the 9th Circuit seat vacated when Anthony M. Kennedy  was appointed to the Supreme Court. A highly regarded, generally conservative  judge, she was among those considered for the high court nomination that  eventually went to Kennedy.  </P> <P> Fernandez, 51, was nominated by Reagan after his first choice, San Diego law  professor Bernard H. Siegan, was rejected by the Senate Judiciary Committee  last June. Before being named to the federal bench, Fernandez was a Superior  Court judge in San Bernardino from 1980 to 1985.  </P> <P> Bonner, 47, has been the chief federal prosecutor in Los Angeles since 1984.  </P> <P> In contrast to the swift Senate action on Bush's nomination of the three  judges, the Senate Judiciary Committee has not yet scheduled a hearing for San  Francisco attorney Vaughn R. Walker, another nominee first submitted by Reagan  for a federal judgeship in Northern California.  </P> <P> Walker, backed by Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.), is strongly opposed by Sen. Alan  Cranston (D-Calif.) and gay rights activists. Cranston said that he plans to  fight against confirmation, although the practice of automatically withdrawing  a nomination opposed by a home state senator no longer is being followed,  according to a Cranston aide.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Legal Battle  </P> <P> The controversy over Walker involves actions that the 44-year-old attorney took  several years ago during a legal battle between the U.S. Olympic Committee, a  client of Walker's, and the San Francisco-based Gay Olympics. The Olympic  Committee sued successfully to block the gay group from using the Olympic name.  The committee then won a court order directing the gay organization to pay some  of the committee's attorney fees.  </P></p>

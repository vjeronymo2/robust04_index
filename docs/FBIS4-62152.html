			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents] </F>   [Text] Bonn May 13 TASS -- Russia wants to repay its debt  to Germany with MiG-29 fighter planes and is ready to ship them  immediately if Bonn agrees, according to Russian Economics  Minister Aleksandr Shokhin.    "If Germany takes MiG-29 planes we are ready to ship them",  he told TASS on Friday and quoted President Boris Yeltsin as  saying that "if necessary hundreds of fighters will arrive at  local (German) airports in two days".    Shokhin added that one major project has been practically  agreed upon during the visit of the Russian president to  Germany. Bonn is to grant Russia a 500-million mark easy-term  credit for buying railway cars produced in former east Germany.    Shokhin explained that it was impossible for Russia to  manage  the deal without the easy-term credit. Early this year Russia  informed Bonn that the problem of shipping railway cars to  Russia was irresolvable without privileged terms. The German  Government met the Russian request although it was fraught with  a certain confrontation with the Organisation of Economic  Cooperation and Development, Shokhin said.    This is a 10-year easy-term credit granted under government  guarantees, Shokhin said and added that the terms are suitable  for Russia and will not negatively affect its budget deficit.</p>

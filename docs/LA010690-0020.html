			<p><P> January 6, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EMPIRE LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> ESPERANZA HANDS LOARA ITS FIRST LOSS OF SEASON  </P> <P> Loara High School, which had been the only undefeated boys' basketball team in  Orange County, fell from the ranks of the unbeaten Friday night, losing to  Esperanza, 67-65, in the Empire League opener for both schools at Esperanza  High.  </P> <P> Guard Tes Whitlock, who had led Loara to 11 consecutive victories to open the  season, missed a 25-foot jump shot with four seconds remaining as Esperanza  held off a last-minute rally.  </P> <P> "I liked our chances of winning with the ball in Tes' hands in the final  seconds," said Jerry Halpin, Loara coach. "We got good shots all night, but  this was the first time in 12 games that our shots didn't fall."  </P> <P> Loara made only 24 of 68 shots and was only three of 16 from three-point range.  Whitlock was Loara's only consistent scorer with 25 points, but the junior  guard also was cited for a costly technical foul with 4:44 remaining in the  game.  </P> <P> Esperanza guard Walter Forcatto made a pair of free throws and Seth Romans  scored on the ensuing inbounds play to give Esperanza a 62-56 lead and Loara  never recovered.  </P> <P> "Tes thought he got fouled and said something he shouldn't have said to the  referee," Halpin said. "He knew he made a mistake as soon as he said something.  But he almost got us back in the game. Everybody was waiting on the edge of  their seats to see if he made that last shot."  </P> <P> Esperanza (8-7) was in control most of the fourth quarter, opening a  seven-point lead when Romans scored on follow shot with 6:42 remaining to push  Esperanza ahead, 55-48.  </P> <P> Forcatto and Romans took turns dogging Whitlock most of the night and held him  to three points below his season average of 28 points. Whitlock scored more  than half of his points off steals at midcourt, forcing eight turnovers.  </P> <P> "Our goal was to limit Tes' possessions and cut his scoring in half," said Mark  Hill, Esperanza coach. "Romans and Forcatto did an excellent job. I told the  players before the game that we're real close to being a good team, and I think  we proved that tonight."  </P> <P> Forward Joe Foss led Esperanza with 23 points and 10 rebounds before fouling  out late in the fourth quarter. Forcatto added 18 points and teammate Matt  Thimgan added six points and 11 rebounds.  </P> <P> Los Alamitos 69, Katella 33 -- The Griffins held the host Knights scoreless for  the first 4:28 of the game and led, 22-2, at the end of the first quarter. Mike  Wilson scored 15 points for the Griffins (11-5, 1-0). Robert Conlisk and Jason  Cunningham each scored 14 for Los Alamitos. Kevin Carlson scored 19 for Katella  (4-10, 0-1).  </P> <P> El Dorado 90, Cypress 75 -- Cypress' Gerard Rice, a 5-9 guard, scored 40  points, but it wasn't enough at Cypress. Jerome Facione had 28 points and 14  rebounds to lead El Dorado (10-5, 1-0). Mike Bradach added 22 points and Gary  Smith 21 for the Golden Hawks. Emmitt Smith had 10 points for Cypress (7-8,  0-1).  </P></p>

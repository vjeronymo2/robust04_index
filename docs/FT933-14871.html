			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / German duo dances to different tunes: Christopher Parkes and Alan Cane examine the reasons for Siemens' tribulations in computers When giants learn to dance, a little flat-footedness is to be expected. But Siemens, Germany's leading electrical and electronics group, seems not to be an especially apt pupil. It fell over its own feet with the 1989 acquisition of Rolm from IBM. It took almost four years to integrate it with its private telecommunications business because someone underestimated the fundamental differences between US and German telephone systems. The judges are waiting watchfully to see how it copes with another transatlantic two-step. Siemens, seeking a partner for its Osram lighting subsidiary, paid GTE DM1bn last year for its North American Sylvania operation. Since Osram is Europe's number two lamp maker after Philips, buying continental Sylvania was ruled out on competition grounds. Although no calamities are expected, critics wonder how fitting a pair the businesses make when, for example, vehicle lamp specifications vary so greatly between Europe and the US. For the moment, however, the main problem preoccupying Mr Heinrich von Pierer, the new Siemens chairman, is the lumbering performance of Siemens Nixdorf Informationssysteme (SNI), an ill-matched merger arranged by Deutsche Bank in 1990. The industrial logic appeared plain enough. Steady, tradition-based Siemens had 20 per cent of the German market for mainframe machines and made modest profits on equipment supplied mostly by Fujitsu of Japan. Live-wire, entrepreneurial Nixdorf had flourished in the 1980s, winning 25 per cent of the home market for its mini-computers. It also came equipped with a strong software business. Together, according to Deutsche Bank thinking, Germany had its own DM8bn-a-year internationally competitive computer industry combining the best of old and new, safe in the arms of one of the country's most stable industrial concerns. Last week, almost three years after the merger, Mr von Pierer said he expected SNI's losses this year to match last year's deficit of DM513m (Pounds 202m). This will bring the cumulative loss since the company was formed to almost DM2bn. Unit personal computer sales had increased 50 per cent, he said, but price wars and currency losses had cost an estimated DM1bn. The roots of SNI's difficulties lie in its dependence on hardware sales and the changed relationship between costs and revenues. The gross profit on a mainframe used to be as much as 90 per cent, ample to pay for expensive sales forces and elaborate customer support, and still yield a worthwhile profit. Today the gross return is 60 per cent and falling. The comparable figure for mini-computers may be less than 40 per cent and below 20 per cent for PCs. Meanwhile, customers are turning away from mainframes and minis in favour of networks of PCs, which are more flexible and cheaper. The first indications of these problems were apparent when SNI came into being. In its last year of independence, Nixdorf, having built up its workforce to almost 30,000 in the expectation of continued growth, lost DM1bn on sales of DM5.6bn as the boom petered out. Recession, striking hard at mainframe sales, together with structural change in the industry and its markets, further compounded SNI's difficulties It was only later, when orders went unbooked, sales went unbilled and losses grew, that Siemens came to appreciate that the new partners were dancing different steps to different tunes. The Siemens side chose to lead. The Nixdorf team, unaccustomed to sluggish bureaucracies, found its entrepreneurial spirit being squeezed out. The fledgling SNI, already trying to adapt to change in the industry and to recession, was being riven internally by a clash of cultures. Morale suffered as the parent applied rough and ready remedies to staunch the profits drain. Already cut to around 47,000 from 52,000 at the time of the merger, the workforce is scheduled to drop to less than 40,000 by the end of 1995. Only latterly has internal structural change come to the fore. Last October, for example, the PC business was split, according to the current fashion, into three business units. PCs, high performance printers and systems integration are now separate profit centres. In April the process of subdivision was extended throughout the concern with the creation of four units responsible for products, and six more in charge of internal and external services - from procurement to maintenance. 'When I look at what has been achieved in the last few months alone, I am convinced we'll bring about a turnaround,' said a confident Mr von Pierer. Changes at SNI embody his view of the main sources of future strength for the group. His predecessor, Mr Karl-Heinz Kaske, who enlarged Siemens by acquisition, finally broke the monolith into 17 operating divisions encompassing 300 activities. Within this frame, Mr von Pierer aims to create a network of individual profit centres, fostering the entrepreneurial spirit as he goes. He expects SNI to be profitable within three years, when it will be ready for its next important development: a partner. His computer business may be relatively strong in Germany, but it has less than 2 per cent of the DM14bn-a-year European PC market, only marginally more of the DM7.5bn systems integration business and around 13 per cent of the DM6bn medium-sized Unix computer market. Long-term supplier Fujitsu, the Japanese mainframe specialist, with which SNI recently extended its links, is the name which crops up most often. Since Mr von Pierer insists that any relationship should be on equal terms, much depends on the success of the restructuring - and the speed at which recession unwinds - in restoring SNI to profit. Although he repeats with rising fervour that computers and information technology have a core role in the group, if the return to the black is too long delayed, even he may come to agree with the critics who say Siemens would dance far better with one less leg.</p>

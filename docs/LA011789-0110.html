			<p><P> January 17, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MICHAEL REAGAN OPENS THE MIKE AND GUESS WHO CALLS?  </P> <P> Officials at KSDO-AM (1130) knew they would get some interesting phone calls  when their new morning talk-show host Michael Reagan started work Monday. Sure  enough, when the first caller went on the air just after 5:30 a.m., the voice  was familiar.  </P> <P> "Mike, this is your old man," the caller said.  </P> <P> Despite initial skepticism from the KSDO staff, who feared they were being made  the victim of a prank, the caller was President Reagan. The staff had arranged  for Michael's sister, Maureen, to call and wish him luck on his new career. His  father called instead.  </P> <P> "I'm a little far away to hear the program, but I wanted to congratulate you on  your first day and wish you well," the President said on the air.  </P> <P> Michael Reagan and KSDO program manager Jack Merker spent a few minutes talking  with the President about his return to California and his weekend visit to Camp  David. Father and son exchanged best wishes before the elder Reagan signed off.  </P> <P> "One of the more different wake-up calls I've ever had," Merker said  afterwards. "I've been doing this for 35 years, and I've never had a call from  the White House. It's kind of neat."  </P> <P> Michael Reagan, 44, the President's elder son, has signed a two-year contract  to serve as an announcer for KSDO's top-rated morning show, reading the news  and bantering with Merker. Reagan, the adopted son of Ronald Reagan and Jane  Wyman, has been behind the mike at KSDO before, filling in for the regular  talk-show hosts, such as former San Diego Mayor Roger Hedgecock.  </P> <P> Reagan also has served as a talk-show host for KABC-AM (790) in Los Angeles and  for "Lingo," a television game show in Canada, among other broadcasting jobs.  </P> <P> When he was a high school quarterback, his nickname was "Mouth," Reagan said at  a news conference after his first morning stint.  </P> <P> "I don't think that's changed," he said.  </P> <P> KSDO general manager Mike Shields acknowledged that the "Reagan name is very  popular in San Diego," but he denied that Michael Reagan was hired because of  his name.  </P> <P> "The decision to hire Michael was based on the experience he had already  exhibited to us sitting in for Roger Hedgecock," Shields said. "Michael showed  us he had the presence and talent to do the radio work. He has a very warm and  friendly style."  </P> <P> Thanks to his parents, Reagan has always been in the public eye. It has not  always been a comfortable position for him. In 1981, he created a stir when he  used his father's name in a letter soliciting clients for an airplane parts  company for which he worked.  </P> <P> During the early part of his father's presidency, Michael focused much of his  energy on organizing boat races for charity. Last year, he released something  of a "Daddy Dearest" autobiography, "Michael Reagan: On the Outside Looking  In," which detailed his problems growing up as the son of Ronald Reagan. Reagan  and Wyman were divorced when he was 3 years old.  </P> <P> "As you go through life, a lot of people try to use you," Reagan said Monday.  "The toughest thing is trying to find who is using you and who is not."  </P> <P> KSDO officials didn't have to try very hard to persuade him to join the  station, Reagan said.  </P> <P> "I don't want to go through life telling people I turned down morning  drive-time," he quipped. "It's new for me, and I'm looking forward to the  stretch and getting into it."  </P> <P> He said he enjoys working mornings, which leaves him time to play golf and be  with his family. Currently a resident of the San Fernando Valley, he plans to  move to San Diego after his children, Cameron, 9, and Ashley, 7, finish the  school year.  </P> <P> On Friday, his father leaves office after eight years. Michael Reagan was asked  what he would miss about having the White House as a second home.  </P> <P> "The fights with Nancy," he said with a laugh, referring to his stepmother's  battered media image. "Nancy and I were talking and we decided that the press  is one fight ahead of us."  </P> <P> Noting that he is in "awe" of his father's accomplishments, Michael, who wrote  in his book that he always found it difficult to be close to his father, said  he is looking forward to his father's return to California, so they can spend  more time together.  </P> <P> Reagan said he has learned from the example set by his father, a former radio  sports broadcaster, but he does not try to compare himself to his father.  </P> <P> "I try to live up to Mike Reagan, not Ronald Reagan," he said, adding that once  the novelty of his family wears off, he will have to establish his own radio  identity.  </P> <P> "People just won't listen to a name," he said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ FANS ON LIST? LOOK NO FURTHER;  </P> <P> MUSIC: SAN DIEGO IS HOME TO SOME TOP JAZZ TALENT, AND A LARGE SELECTION OF  QUALITY MUSIC IS AVAILABLE FOR HOLIDAY GIFTS.  </P> <P> Want to give the gift of jazz to your favorite music buff?  </P> <P> You can walk the aisles of your major chain music store and fill your basket  with the obvious big-name albums.  </P> <P> Or you can take another approach: Why not turn your musical friend onto one or  two of the many recordings made by San Diego musicians?  </P> <P> San Diego's jazz scene is so low-key, most people aren't aware how much top  talent is here. Yet those who follow it can vouch for the large quantity of  recorded music -- excellent music -- available.  </P> <P> "I'd say there are at least 3 dozen albums," said Paul Lavoie, host of "San  Diego Spotlight," the Sunday night local jazz program on KIFM (98.1). Lavoie's  tastes run toward lighter, commercial jazz, but there are even more albums  available by mainstream players.  </P> <P> Jude Hibler, publisher of The Jazz Link, a monthly San Diego jazz journal, came  up with a list of 77 musicians who have either recorded their own albums or  played on sessions with other musicians.  </P> <P> With the recent migration to San Diego by such top jazz players as sax man  James Moody and guitarists Mundell Lowe and Barney Kessel, the list of recorded  local talent grew even more impressive.  </P> <P> The Tower Records on Sports  </P> <P> Arena Boulevard is the place most often mentioned by local musicians as a  source of their recorded music. Folk Arts Rare Records on Adams Avenue in San  Diego stocks several hard-to-find albums by local players.  </P> <P> Here, then, are some jazzy picks for your Christmas shopping list:  </P> <P> * No lover of jazz saxophonists dating back to Lester Young, Charlie Parker or  Coleman Hawkins should be without an album by Moody. His newest is titled  "Sweet and Lovely."  </P> <P> Moody, 64, is a survivor. He's played with the greats, and lived to assimilate  their influences. Today, Moody's mood is buoyant, his playing at times melodic,  witty, fiery. Old pal Dizzy Gillespie joins him for two tunes on the new album.  </P> <P> * Another survivor is La Jolla saxophonist Charles McPherson, a sax master in  his own right who has made several albums. Most recently, he played Parker's  sax parts on the sound track for "Bird," the movie about the life of Parker.  </P> <P> * Mike Wofford is one of San Diego's top jazz pianists. He is featured on Ella  Fitzgerald's new album, due for release early next year, and he's done a number  of notable projects of his own. One of his most critically acclaimed sessions  is this year's "Gerald's People," on which Wofford tackles the music of veteran  composer, band leader and trumpeter Gerald Wilson, with Rufus Reid on bass and  Carl Burnett on drums.  </P> <P> * Bassist Bob Magnusson, who often plays with Wofford, has several albums of  his own, including the 3-year-old "Song for Janet Lee" with Hubert Laws, Bobby  Shew, Peter Sprague and Billy Mintz, and earlier collaborations with such  talents as Bill Mays, John Guerin and Hubert Laws.  </P> <P> * Saxophonists Joe Marillo and Tony Ortega have both recorded albums over the  years. Ortega's work ranges from the avant garde 1965 "Revelation" to the more  mainstream 1979 "Rain Dance," including Ortega's wife Mona Orbeck on vibes.  Neither has recorded recently, but a little sleuthing is bound to turn up the  existing albums.  </P> <P> * Paul Sundfor, the local alto sax man, is revered by local players. He has no  albums as a leader, but he played on Wofford's 1987 "Funkallero" and also joins  bassist Andy Simpkins on an album due in January.  </P> <P> * Guitarist Peter Sprague has recorded several albums; one of the most  satisfying was last year's "Na Pali Coast," featuring Sprague with the fine Los  Angeles flutist Steve Kujala. Sprague and Kujala hooked up to create lilting,  tropical melodies that do justice to the album's title, a reference to an area  in Hawaii.  </P> <P> * A pair of San Diego flutists also issued albums last year. Lori Bell's "Take  Me To Brazil," a collaboration with pianist Dave Mackay, finds the pair putting  their energy into melodic music, often anchored by Latin rhythms. Holly Hofmann  recorded "Take Note" with Wofford on piano, Sherman Ferguson on drums and Bob  Magnusson on bass.  </P> <P> * In the realm of bluesy jazz are Jeannie and Jimmy Cheatham, whose 1989 album  "Back to the 'Hood," recorded with their Sweet Baby Blues Band, received raves  from jazz critics across the country.  </P> <P> * San Diego's avant-garde jazz scene is nearly invisible, but it does exist.  Perhaps the most prolific of the cutting-edge local players is pianist Glenn  Horiuchi, who, in the space of less than three years, has recorded three fine  albums for the tiny Bay Area-based Asian Improv label.  </P> <P> Horiuchi brings the frenetic energy of pianist Cecil Taylor to his roots in  traditional Chinese music.  </P> <P> * Also in the realm of cutting-edge jazz is the technically awesome San Diego  pianist Harry Pickens, who can be heard on several Blue Note albums with the  group Out of the Blue.  </P> <P> * At the other end of the spectrum are several San Diego artists who have made  it big with a lighter, commercial radio-oriented brand of jazz.  </P> <P> One of the most impressive debuts was this year's "Architects of Change," by  composer and keyboard wiz Spencer Nilsen. Instead of the soporific elevator  jazz that often gets commercial play, Nilsen has built a complex wall of sound  anchored by relentless pulsing rhythms over which he lays his powerful,  synthesized melody lines.  </P> <P> * Checkfield, a studio duo consisting of John Archer and Ron Satterfield  (Archer "discovered" Nilsen) came out with "Through the Lens" last year, the  band's third album. It doesn't have as much raw spunk as Nilsen's album, but as  polished, multitracked studio projects go, this one is state of the art.  </P> <P> Other local light jazz leaders are Neon, featuring Hollis Gentry, and  Fattburger. Albums by both bands this year sold well and made it onto radio  play lists across the country. The Mark Lessman Band and Flight 7 also released  light jazz albums in 1989.  </P> <P> San Diego also has its share of golden era jazz men, players with experience  dating back to the big band days.  </P> <P> Band leader Bob Crosby lives in La Jolla. Though he didn't play an instrument  or read or write music, Crosby fronted a group of top musicians who defected  from leader Ben Pollack in the '30s. With Crosby, they recorded several albums  in the '30s and '40s.  </P> <P> Crosby bassist Bob Haggart, of La Costa, has made several albums with trumpeter  Yank Lawson in The World's Greatest Jazz Band. They are available by mail  (Audiophile Records, 1206 Decatur St., New Orleans 70116).  </P> <P> During the years when Haggart was working with Crosby, San Diego trumpeter John  Best was playing and recording with the big bands of Les Brown, Artie Shaw,  Glenn Miller and others, and many of these albums can still be found.  </P> <P> Several other names belong on this list, though there isn't room to discuss  their work in detail: singer Frankie Laine, saxophonist Gary Lefebvre, singer  Kevyn Lettau (with Sergio Mendes and Sprague), guitarist (and Padre pitcher)  Eric Show, the South Market Street Band (Dixieland; buy their tapes at live  dates); Art Resnick; Nelson Riddle Jr.; the San Diego State University Jazz  Ensemble; clarinetist Bobby Gordon, Fro Brigham and many others.  </P></p>

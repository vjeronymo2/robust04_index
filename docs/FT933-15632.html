			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Survey of Greece (6): Neighbours evoke old suspicions - The Balkan obsession GREECE'S progressive integration in the western world's leading organisations, such as the European Community and Nato, has done nothing to lessen its historical obsession with Balkan problems and its volatile relations with its neighbours. On the contrary, the ending of the cold war and the growing economic problems within the EC, which has switched some of the spotlight from Greece's own economic failings, has allowed Athens to devote even greater energy to Balkan affairs. That interest and concern is not, of course, entirely in the Greeks' own minds. It is natural that the break-up of Yugoslavia and the resulting conflicts so close to its borders, particularly in Bosnia-Hercegovina, should preoccupy the Greek government and public opinion. What can be questioned, however, is whether the undoubtedly worrying situation in the former Yugoslavia and some of the surrounding regions, should evoke reactions and policies from Greece, some of which appear to be more appropriate to the early part of this century than to an era in which Greece's allies and partners are guarantors of its territorial integrity. The war in Bosnia, recalling at least in Greek minds the ancient struggles between the Islamic and the Christian worlds, has conjured up all the old fears about Turkish and Islamic domination of the region. There is talk in Athens about a 'Turkish arc' stretching from Turkey via Macedonia to Albania, if the Moslem populations of Bosnia, Albania, Kosovo and Macedonia are allowed to get out of hand. To be worried about the stability of the region, particularly if there is an uprising in Kosovo which, though part of Serbia, has a predominantly Albanian population, is one thing. Turkey, however, has not shown any signs recently of wanting to exploit the situation in the Balkans. Though urging the international community to act more vigorously in support of the Bosnian Moslems, it has been careful not to take any unilateral action. With the election of Mr Suleyman Demirel, first as prime minister and recently as successor to the late President Turgut Ozal, the heat has been taken out of some of the traditional Greco-Turk bilateral problems, such as quarrels over the Aegean continental shelf and airspace. The Cyprus talks at the United Nations remain deadlocked without, however, generating too much tension between Ankara and Athens and Turkey has now accepted that it has no chance of joining the European Community until the next century, even if Greece were to adopt a more accommodating attitude towards its application. Yet in spite of the relatively quiescent state of Greco-Turk relations and the fact that the Turks are increasingly turning their attention to central Asia, the Greeks remain suspicious that their traditional enemy will be up to something in the Balkans as soon as it has a chance. The improvement in Turkish-Bulgarian relations, following the demise of the communist regime in Bulgaria and the adoption of more liberal attitudes towards inhabitants of Turkish origin in that country, is seen in Athens as more of a potential threat to Greek interests than a welcome contribution to regional stability. The long-running row over the name under which the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia should be recognised as an independent and sovereign state is symptomatic of these historical and deeply-ingrained Greek attitudes and a reflection of what one foreign diplomat has described as 'a tremendous lack of national self-confidence'. Both the Greek government and a large majority of the Greek population insist that Macedonia, which is also the name of Greece's northernmost region, is part of the nation's cultural identity dating back to King Alexander the Great. To allow the former Yugoslav republic of Skopje, the name of its capital by which it is always called by the Greeks, to adopt Macedonia as its sole name and the 16-pointed star of Vergina, an ancient Macedonian symbol, as its flag, would be an insult to the Greek nation and people, it is argued. Even worse, it would endorse the territorial claims on northern Greece of those in the multi-ethnic former Yugoslav republic who harbour ambitions of uniting all Macedonians within one nation. It is true that such fears might once have been justified. If the communists, supported by Marshal Tito, and including many people of Slav origin, had won the Greek civil war in 1949, a carve-up of northern Greece might well have taken place. As it was, the defeated guerrillas fled over the border, giving rise to present-day Greek fears that some of their descendants have inherited their territorial ambitions. The latest state of play is that Greece and Macedonia, which in March was allowed to take its seat at the United Nations under the temporary description of Former Yugoslav Repulic of Macedonia, or FYROM, have been given until September by the UN to resolve their dispute over a permanent name. They recently rejected the compromise name of 'Nova Makedonija', proposed by Mr Cyrus Vance, the former UN mediator, because of their respective leaders' domestic problems. But they could well return to this suggestion during their direct talks over the next three months, which are also expected to deal with confidence-building measures, such as guaranteeing Macedonia access to the northern Greek port of Thessaloniki (Salonika). The net result for Greek foreign policy, is that Athens' relations with its European Community partners and, indeed, a much wider group of UN members, have been soured quite unnecessarily, given that it was always clear that a compromise had to be reached at the end of the road. Nor has Greece's international standing been enhanced by its close relationship with Serbia at a time when that country has been condemned throughout the world for its support of the Bosnian Serbs and has been punished by international sanctions. The moment of glory enjoyed by Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, the Greek prime minister, when he was perceived to have contributed to the conclusion of an international peace on Bosnia at an Athens meeting in May, was all too short-lived, since the plan was rejected by the Bosnian Serb assembly a few days later. The close alliance with Serbia, based once again on a common Christian Orthodox faith and the belief that Greece and Serbia can build a bulwark against the perceived expansionist designs of Turkey and other Islamic nations, appears to the rest of the world as ill-founded and short-sighted. It is yet one more example of a policy which, by focusing entirely on the country's short-term regional interests, risks losing Greece more friends in the western world than such a small country can afford.</p>

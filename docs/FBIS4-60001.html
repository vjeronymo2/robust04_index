			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 17 May (MENA)--The repercussions of the war  between north and south Yemen have been felt in its embassies  and diplomatic missions abroad, especially after Yemeni Foreign  Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah issued a decree dismissing a  number of southern Yemeni diplomats who work in its embassies  abroad. Among these are Mr. Muhammad Shahir Sayf, acting Yemeni  representative to the Arab League.    Mr. Shahir Sayf described the Yemeni foreign minister's  request for the Arab League secretariat to withdraw Sayf's  accreditation and for Sayf to return to Yemen as "unjust and  illegitimate".    He said that Yemeni Prime Minister Engineer Haydar Abu-Bakr  al-'Attas had instructed him to continue his duties in this  position. He pointed out that the reason behind the dismissal  from his duties is because he is a southerner.    Muhammad Shahir Sayf said the Yemeni foreign minister's  decision to remove him from the Yemeni representative office in  Cairo was a unilateral decision prompted by divisionist notions.  He noted that the Yemeni foreign minister should have waited  for the war to end before making such a decision.    Mr. Muhammad Shahir Sayf said that he does not take his  orders from Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah, but from  Yemeni Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas (a southerner),  "whom I consider to be the legitimate prime minister despite  Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's decision to dismiss  him", he said.    He affirmed that he will stay in his position as acting  permanent Yemeni representative to the Arab League. He pointed  out that the representation office has already sent a letter  regarding this matter to the Arab League Secretariat.    MENA has learned that one of the reasons Muhammad Shahir  Sayf  was dismissed was that he ignored Yemeni Foreign Minister  Muhammad Salim Basindwah during the latter's recent visit to  Cairo. Sayf also, without guidance from Sanaa, declined to head  the latest emergency session of the Arab League Council.    It is worth noting here that Muhammad Shahir Sayf assumed  his  current position when Yemen's previous permanent representative  to the Arab League, Ahmad al-Shajbi, travelled to London for  treatment, where he died a few days ago and was buried in Cairo.</p>

			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / Japanese trade houses face penalties JAPAN'S leading trading houses, Sumitomo Corporation and Nissho Iwai Corporation, each evaded at least Y1bn (Pounds 4.27m) in taxes between March 1987 and March 1989, a Japanese news agency reported, Reuter writes from Tokyo. Kyodo news agency said on Wednesday that the Osaka Regional Taxation Bureau had imposed additional corporate taxes of more than Y1bn on each of the companies because it had identified that they intentionally evaded taxes. The companies had made tax payments several times since the bureau investigated the unpaid taxes, Kyodo said. The agency said that duringthose years Sumitomo had declared income of about Y120bn and Nissho Iwai about Y46.5bn. Neither Sumitomo nor Nissho Iwai was immediately available for comment. Tokyo's stock market is closed today for New Year holidays and reopens on Monday, January 6.</p>

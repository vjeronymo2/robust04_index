It is being promulgated so that the water districts have access to the legal requirements that Reclamation applies in crediting revenues to the district. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Written comments on this proposed rule must be received on or before November 14, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Written comments on this proposed rule are to be submitted to Donald R.

Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The 1902 passage of the Reclamation Act, (43 U.S.C. 391,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) provided for the creation of the Reclamation fund (a fund within the U.S. Treasury) to be used to finance water projects in the arid west. These water projects were to be constructed on a reimbursable basis with the water users repaying the funds advanced from the Reclamation fund, without interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The early Reclamation projects were for irrigation only, and the irrigators were responsible for the repayment of all costs associated with these projects. Intending to recover the costs of construction projects as quickly as possible, Congress set the time frame for the repayment of funds by the water users in this initial period at 10 years. This responsibility, and the original repayment time frame of 10 years, proved to be a difficult and significant burden on the water users. In 1914, this term was extended to 20 years by Section 2 of the Reclamation Extension Act of August 13, 1914 (43 U.S.C. 475).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Originally, the funds that made up the Reclamation fund were from revenues generated by the sale of public lands (see Section 1 of the Reclamation Act of 1902.) It soon became apparent that this source of revenue was not sufficient to cover the costs of constructing water projects. This was addressed in a variety of statutes, one of which was the Sundry Civil Expenses Appropriations Act for 1920 (43 U.S.C. 394). This act forms the basis for the allocation of lease revenues by requiring that revenues generated from the leasing of withdrawn Reclamation lands would be a credit to the Reclamation fund.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 1920's saw the agriculture industry experiencing serious economic difficulties that further affected the water users' ability to meet their contractual obligations to the United States. Responding to these difficulties, Congress enacted the Fact Finders Act of 1924. Section 4, Subsection I of the Fact Finders Act created an entitlement program that allowed the direct crediting of certain revenues to the water users. Providing the water users assumed responsibility for the operation and maintenance of the project, the revenues from certain activities conducted on Federal lands would be used toward relieving the water users of their yearly payment on the construction costs. The revenues were restricted to those from project power plants, leasing of project lands for grazing and farms, and the sale or use of townsite lots. These revenues were to be applied as a direct or front-end credit: (1) To the water users' annual construction charges; (2) to their annual project operation and maintenance expenses; and (3) as directed by the water users (43 U.S.C. 501). Revenues were required to be credited to construction costs until all obligations to the United States have been repaid.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additional relief was provided when the Congress approved The Omnibus Adjustment Act of May 25, 1926, that allowed the Secretary to extend the crediting provisions of Subsection I to water districts in identified projects without requiring them to assume responsibility for operation and maintenance of the project. Section 45 of the Omnibus Adjustment Act also allowed the Secretary of the Interior to amend existing water-rights contracts, at the request of the water district, to extend the repayment period to 40 years (43 U.S.C. 423d).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Congress did not, in its enactment of Subsection I, repeal prior revenue specific statutes, nor did it indicate that the revenue disposition requirements reflected in Subsection I would extend to revenues derived from sources not identified. For example, the revenue disposition requirements of the Act for the Sale of Surplus Acquired Lands of February 2, 1911, provided for the revenues from the sale of such lands to be a ``credit to the project''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rather than a credit to the water users (43 U.S.C. 374).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

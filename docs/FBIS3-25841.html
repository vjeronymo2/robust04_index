According to the requirements of the provincial party  committee and the provincial government, our province should  completely pay back the wages in arrears to teachers, office  cadres, and retired cadres by 5 February.    After hearing the reports, Cheng Weigao said: In the  previous stage, according to the guidelines of the central  authorities and the requirements of the provincial party  committee and the provincial government, the departments  concerned in the province did a lot of work and adopted some  very good methods and measures. Although a few problems have not  completely been solved, most problems have been alleviated. To  further improve the work and thoroughly solve the problems, we  should mainly attend to two tasks. First, we should set time to  pay back the wages in arrears to teachers, cadres, and retired  cadres; and to solve the problems that the staff members and  workers of the enterprises with difficulties, the disaster-hit  rural areas, and the extremely difficult areas lack money and  grain to spend the Spring Festival. Second, we should ensure  the stability of goods prices and particularly ensure to  stabilize the prices of grain, oil, meat, eggs, and vegetables.  We should realistically conduct price inspections and market  management.    Cheng Weigao pointed out: Solving practical problems for the  masses and ensuring we spend the Spring Festival in a good way  is not a specific problem but a matter relating to the overall  situation. As for the areas that cannot pay back the wages in  arrears, the leaders there should first sell their sedan cars  and then pay wages to the staff and workers.    Cheng Weigao stressed: Our country is not rich enough. So,  we should vigorously advocate the policy of being diligent to  build the country and do all undertakings and the policy of  waging an arduous struggle and arduously doing pioneering work,  resolutely oppose waste and extravagance, and create the  greatest economic results with the least input. The leading  organs and the leading cadres should set an example in this  regard.</p>

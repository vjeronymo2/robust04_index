			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Fully informed decision Sir, An otherwise excellent article on employee relations in BT (Management: 'Bad connections at BT', November 7) was marred by suggestions that 'the dispute over flexible working was resolved in a private chat between (Michael) Hepher (BT's managing director) and Tony Young, leader of the NCU'. If I, as general secretary, 'resolved' the issue with a private chat, what on earth was the executive council doing at its meetings on September 15 and September 20 (the latter continuing until three o'clock in the morning)? It was debating the resolution of a major industrial issue, which would otherwise have led to massive disruption of BT's operation. My job was to ensure that the executive was able to come to a fully informed decision. Further, it was able to do this in the most democratic way, and in the most open of forums. This is how trade unions come to decisions; not over cosy chats. Tony Young, general secretary, National Communications Union, Greystoke House, 150 Brunswick Road, Ealing, London W5 1AW</p>

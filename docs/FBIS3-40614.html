			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "State Bank Report"] </F>   [Text] The State Bank has called the preceding year a  difficult year from the economic perspective in its annual  report. According to this report, for the first time in many  years, there has been no increase in per capita income in  Pakistan. The export situation is also the same. Foreign  exchange reserves have been reduced dramatically and prices have  increased rapidly. The report further added that no increase was  seen in collection of taxes as indicated by the GDP. The public  sector established a record in borrowing. The State Bank also  declared the present rate of inflation to be wrong.    The report issued by the State Bank presents to us a very  serious picture of our country's economy. There are two major  reasons for it. First is natural catastrophes and the second is  political uncertainty and confrontations. There is no doubt that  heavy rains and floods seriously damaged standing crops and  harmed the basic structure and personal property in most areas.  Cotton, rice, and sugar cane crops were ruined as the result of  it. After continuous increase in our agriculture, this year we  faced reduction for the first time. Thirty percent of our cotton  production was destroyed by floods. Since exports depend on  cotton and cotton products, there has been no increase in  exports which Pakistan needs badly. Another major reason for  decline in exports is the unsuitable situation abroad. Market  slump around the world, change in trade rules, and the negative  affects of stiff competition in the international market have  all influenced the exports. It is important to pay immediate  attention to these problems. Heavy rains and floods have  affected our basic economic structure in addition to damaging  crops, which in turn directly affect industrial production.  Improved basic economic structure is important for establishing  new industries. Unfortunately, the basic structure did not  improve, instead, it hurt the present services. This also needs  immediate attention. One major reason for our economic woes is  said to be political uncertainty. The truth is that there was  irreparable damage to our country because of the confrontation  between the president and the prime minister. Not only were the  plans already being implemented affected adversely, but foreign  investors were also discouraged. Our politicians should learn  from the bitter experiences of the past and give up the politics  of confrontation. They should find solutions to all  controversial issues through negotiation and understanding. As  for the increase in inflation and prices, it appears the  independent economic experts do not find it easy to agree with  the figures released by the government. Repeatedly, we have also  expressed concern about inflation and increasing prices in these  columns. The main reasons for this are the wrong economic  policies. The basic reasons for inflation and price increases  are the unchecked spread of currency notes, decrease in cuts in  government spending, budget deficit, unchecked increase in  unproductive expenses, and the public sector's borrowing money  from banks just to meet routine expenses. This is not only  harming our economic system, but also affecting the rate of  savings and investments. The State Bank has also proposed an  action program to improve the economy in its report to the  government. It asks to reduce inflation, federal budget deficit,  and proliferation of currency. International economic  organizations have been putting pressure on Pakistan in this  area. It is a relief to know that the newly elected government  is giving priority to it. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has more  than once declared her plans to reduce inflation, budget  deficit, and unproductive expenses. She had also made some  progress in this respect during her first government. Let us  hope that concrete steps will be taken to rectify the problems  identified in the State Bank report and the suggested plans are  implemented to speed up our economic development.</p>

			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WINE: A GREAT WHITE;  </P> <P> THE ROBERT PEPI WINERY TAMES THE SAVAGE SAUVIGNON BLANC  </P> <P> IT HAS NEVER been easy to produce fine Sauvignon Blanc, because the grape  involved commonly imparts to the wine "savage" taste elements -- from a mild  grassiness to the flavor of asparagus juice. Thus, it is rare that a winery  specializes in Sauvignon Blanc. But the Robert Pepi Winery in Napa Valley does  so -- with exceptionally good results.  </P> <P> Eighty-five percent of the winery's total production is devoted to white wines,  primarily Sauvignon Blanc and Semillon, and Pepi considers the Sauvignon Blanc  to be its flagship. The walls are covered with medals attesting to Pepi's  success, beginning with its first vintage in 1981.  </P> <P> Wine makers everywhere wrestle with taming the worrisome taste overtones of  Sauvignon Blanc. I know of whole vineyards that have been T-bud grafted,  whereby the top of the Sauvignon Blanc vines are cut off and replacement buds  of another varietal are grafted in their place.  </P> <P> In my columns, I have mentioned new techniques such as leaf pulling and vine  training to bring more air and sunlight to the grape clusters and eliminate the  grassiness. These methods result in a wonderful melon, peach, fig or even  ripe-lime fruitiness.  </P> <P> The Pepi winery uses these techniques and more. Its Sauvignon Blanc is styled  in the French tradition, in which Semillon is blended.  </P> <P> The Sauvignon Blanc grapes are harvested at low sugar levels, which will give  the wine a soft fruit quality. The wine then is blended with Semillon to give  it texture and aging potential. The two varietals, which came to California in  the 1880s from the famed Chateau d'Yquem vineyard in Bordeaux, are later  married in 1,600-gallon French oak upright tanks to develop complexity. The  vessels, much larger than the standard 50-gallon barrels, minimize the oak  tastes that the wine would pick up in smaller barrels because less wine is  exposed to the oak in the tanks. The wine emerges with an almost floral  bouquet, light herbal tastes and a lush, savory roundness. It's a winner every  vintage. Trying the 1987 Robert Pepi Napa Valley Sauvignon Blanc ($8.50)  confirms this. Composed of 80% Sauvignon Blanc and 20% Semillon, the wine has a  dry finish.  </P> <P> The Pepi family began growing grapes and making wine in the northern Italian  region of Tuscany and the small town of Lucca, from which Robert A. Pepi's  parents emigrated in the early 1900s.  </P> <P> Continuing the family tradition, Robert and Aurora Pepi bought a 70-acre  vineyard near Oakville in 1966. Studies indicated that Sauvignon Blanc and  Semillon grapes were especially well-suited to that site. The Pepi family grew  grapes exclusively until 1979, when Robert's son, Robert L. Pepi, and the  family decided that they could afford to build a winery.  </P> <P> The younger Pepi, as wine maker, is also quite proud of his Cabernet Sauvignon,  a 100% varietal produced from grapes grown at the Vine Hill Ranch, adjacent to  Napa's Martha's Vineyard. Drinkable while still young -- the 1984 vintage  ($16), for example, has intense cedar, juniper and blackberry flavors -- it  ages to a softer, more mellow claret finesse.  </P> <P> Where you find the Robert Pepi Sauvignon Blanc and Cabernet Sauvignon, you'll  probably come upon the Chardonnay ($12) and Semillon ($8). The latter suggests  the tastes of ripe peaches or melons. And the Chardonnay has apple and citrus  flavors, with some buttery tastes from partial malolactic fermentation and  brief time in fine French oak.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] The question posed in Yemen today is no longer: Has  the unity experiment reached an impasse that will force a return  to partition and separation or the use of federalism? Those who  know the secrets of the behind-the-scenes activities are very  afraid of a civil war like Somalia's, in which sultans will  intervene in party conflicts and tribal disputes. The Socialists  accuse President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih of concocting this  scenario with outside parties, aimed at escalating the situation  and pushing the southerners into separatism. This could only end  with military intervention in defense of Yemen's unity and  stability. How was this scenario prepared, what are the  alliances and balances of power, and where will it lead Yemen?  <H5>  Sanaa Turns to Fundamentalist Movements, Tribes, and Sultans </H5> to Liquidate the Socialist Party    Observers of the Yemeni scene are still trying to learn the  factual secrets that the leader of the "southern" Socialist  Party and vice president of the unified state, 'Ali Salim  al-Bid, brought back from his trip abroad. This trip, which he  took right after the parliamentary elections, took him to  several world nations, including the United States.    Sources close to 'Ali Salim al-Bid confirm that he learned  some very serious information from his American meetings with  American and Western experts in Yemeni affairs. He returned with  a different view of the future of the unity experiment and the  dangers that threaten both it and him. This caused him to return  directly to Aden and begin a period of seclusion, starting on 19  August. Nothing gives the impression that it will end  peacefully, with dialogue and conciliation, despite all the  mediation and optimistic statements that have appeared from time  to time. For more than two months, events in Yemen have called  for pessimism, not only with regard to dissolving the unity  agreement, but also the very serious repercussions that this  consequence bears. They go beyond a return to partition and  separation, or even using the option of a federation or  confederation, to the danger of an outbreak of a bloody and  destructive civil war, kindled by the flames of partisan  conflicts, tribal disputes, and foreign interference. This  causes many observers to express fear that this war could exceed  Lebanon's and reach the level of Somalia's.    Despite indications of optimism that appear from time to  time  through statements of mediators, or even through the policy of  moderation and sincerity that Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih has expressed, hinting at his readiness to offer the  necessary commitments to save unity and avert the sacrifice of  life and blood, the continual actual events are more of an  indication for observers of what Yemen can expect. They see a  very dangerous explosion being prepared that will be far  different from those honeyed words. Sources close to the  Socialist Party believe that a true reading of the situation in  Yemen calls for going beyond the declaration of intentions to  study the reality of the scheming intentions that are revealed  by the actions and policies being pursued. They accuse President  'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, i.e., the government in Sanaa, of  exaggeration in raising and defending the slogans of unity and  claiming to ardently adhere to them, while moving secretly in  the opposite direction. They say that he is working to escalate  and ignite the flames of dispute. Last week, those who are  critical of President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih offered new evidence  of his secret policy, when they confirmed his responsibility or,  at least, the government's responsibility under his orders, for  objecting to the procession of Prime Minister Haydar Abu Bakr  al- 'Attas along the heights of Sanaa. When he returned to the  capital to resume dialogue meetings, groups of military police  acted provocatively toward him, to the extent of pursuing the  motorcade even down al-Sitin Street inside Sanaa. It was clear  that the purpose of this action was to escalate the situation  further, in circumstances that would aggravate matters and  increase their complexity day after day. This would help to  increase tension between Sanaa and Aden while, at the same time,  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's circles stress his eagerness to  contain all disputes and overcome difficulties. He has also  approved the 18 points that the Socialist Party put forth as a  condition of 'Ali Salim al-Bid's return from seclusion. This  last issue has poured oil on the fire, kindling more disputes  and emphasizing the continuation of the two sides' mutual  estrangement and the impossibility of dialogue. Circles close to  the Socialist Party have asked how President 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih can announce his agreement to the conditions, while his  opposing Haydar Abu Bakr al-'Attas's parade reflects continued  violation of a basic point in dispute. This point is the  interference of military police in security affairs, especially  internal security, in addition to the continued militarization  of cities and intensified deployment of military forces,  especially in Sanaa.    In this atmosphere, informed circles in Sanaa and Aden  express fears that the two sides will decide in the end to  pursue the return to partition and separation, putting an end to  three and one-half years of the unity experiment, which began on  22 May 1990. These circles note that each side uses a different  special and tactical way to arrive at this depressing result,  considering that the Socialist Party plays an overt game of  endorsing the return to federalism and local rule, which was  expounded by Salim Salih Muhammad, member of the Presidential  Council and assistant secretary general of the Socialist Party.  On the other hand, the game of the Popular General Congress  embraces a great deal of noise, suspicions, and questions. These  circles say that the Socialist Party has discovered that the  ruling party in Sanaa is playing with a well-thought-out mixed  deck. Under cover of defending unity and expressing strong  enthusiasm for it, it is pursuing a tactic aimed ultimately at  squeezing the southerners and forcing them into separatism. At  this point, President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih could find an  appropriate opportunity to intervene in Aden and occupy it, on  behalf of saving unity and protecting the country's higher  interests, security, stability, and civil peace. In the end,  this would lead to the actual unification of Yemen, but under  Sanaa's authority.  <H5>  Intervention Scenario </H5>   'Ali Salim al-Bid supporters stress that he has obtained  data  confirming this scenario. He has learned that a group from the  pro-Iraqi Ba'th Party and Saddam Husayn supporters inside the  regime in Sanaa have been pushing in this direction. They have  prepared the political and military details to achieve this end.  'Ali Salim al-Bid adds that the Iraqi military experts, who are  working beside the Republican Guard in Sanaa, are supervising  preparation of military and security plans in this regard.    Socialist Party groups stress their conviction that all  events in Yemen over several months are contributing to this  scenario. They say that all acts of escalation that have  occurred--and will occur--despite repeated invitations to  dialogue, are aimed at pursuing this plan to the end. They  enumerate a series of actions that have led to increased  difficulties and obstacles impeding the unity experiment, and  that have bogged down any practical implementation of it. They  include a series of assassinations against leaders and prominent  figures of the Socialist Party, as well as other acts of  intimidation and terrorism.    The insistence of the Popular General Congress in Sanaa on  controlling the decision-making sources in the unified  government and occupying the most important and sensitive posts  has led to Socialist and southern feelings of having been  cheated, which have caused them to complain and hint at  separation. The fact is that there is an official and unofficial  current in southern circles that says bitterly and angrily that  the south was the biggest loser in the unification process,  whose agreements have not been effectively applied. Some people  in Sanaa say that unification was between the Socialist Party  and the Congress and, even then, only on the level of the  northern governorates, whether with regard to the general  treasury or the division of jobs. The Socialist Party has  continued to rule the south. Southerners have accused the regime  in Sanaa of pursuing a policy of annexation and abrogation  against them, of dealing with the southern and eastern  governorates as if they were "an annex of Yemen, and as if there  were a birthright-Yemeni and a derived-Yemeni and citizens of  lower degrees," quoting Brigadier General Baras, chairman of the  Preparation Committee for the Hadramawt [meeting]. This  impression has been emphasized more than once by Salim Salih  Muhammad, criticizing the mentality that "looks at us as if we  actually came from outside Yemen." He pointed to the complete  ban on the Socialist Party in the north, while the Congress has  set up shop in all the governorates, where Congress members are  commanders of security, police, and customs, and officials of  the Ministry of Finance. Salim Salih Muhammad got to the nub of  the matter when he asked: "How many Socialist Party cadre are  there in the Office of the Presidency?" Perhaps this feeling of  being cheated is what has caused 'Ali Salim al-Bid and the  Socialists to refer more than once to the fact that they made a  mistake in agreeing to unity. Southerners add to these elements  an important economic factor. Because of this factor, southern  Yemen with 3.5 million inhabitants has suffered more than has  the north from economic problems. In the south, prices have gone  up more, and the inflation rate has reached 600 percent. At the  same time, in the north, inflation has been held to 40 percent.  There has been no distribution of wealth, specifically oil, and  the government has not kept its pledge to establish a free zone  in Aden.    In addition to the exorbitant rise in prices and,  consequently, increased popular resentment because of living  standards, there have been breaches of security and public order  and increased acts of violence, especially organized  assassinations, which have shown the Socialists that they are  the targets. It is worth mentioning that 'Ali Salim al-Bid has  not concealed the fact that one of the reasons for his return to  Aden and his seclusion there was his fear of meeting the same  fate as former North Yemen President Ibrahim al-Hamdi. Al-Hamdi  was pro-unity and was killed in mysterious circumstances in  October 1977, on the eve of an intended visit to make to Aden.  Al-Bid has indicated that al-Hamdi's assassination was "the  result of treachery. We must get rid of this deception and  trickery."    The Socialist Party's leadership has, more than once,  accused  elements connected with Sanaa of being behind the assassinations  and attempted assassinations, to which more than one party  official has been exposed. It has said that those who carried  out these acts enjoy the protection of prominent northern  officials. The party has made the issue of exposing them and  conducting investigations a basic condition with regard to  returning to "normalcy."    In the past few days, prominent Socialists have bluntly  revealed the existence of a plan aimed at assassinating party  figures and leaders in Sanaa, including Minister of Defense  Haytham Qasim Tahir, and certain Socialist Party Political  Office members. They stress that there is no security for the  lives of southern officials in Sanaa. A few days after the  discussion of these plans, a senior southern officer was  kidnapped by unknown persons who led him away from his room in  one of Sanaa's hotels. He had come there from Aden on a mission.  Observers believe the case of Lieutenant Colonel Mahmud Mas'ad  al-Huraysi, a senior Armed Forces officer, is very serious and  intended to stir up discord among individuals of the Armed  Forces, which have not only remained un-united, but have also  recently been conducting military movements. They are making  continuous preparations to guard against any surprise, and have  brought back partition--in a way--by placing barrels [at border  crossings]. The situation is tense along border areas between  north and south, which have previously seen three wars.  <H5>  Fundamentalists and Sultans </H5>   Socialist Party circles accuse the Popular General Congress  of carrying out a series of assassinations, for the purpose of  further escalating the crisis in accordance with a prepared  scenario. They have information that Sanaa, in order to achieve  its escalation strategy, is relying on other factors and  elements. The first factor is Islamic extremists. Socialists  accuse many of them of fomenting security disturbances in Aden  and carrying out assassination attempts against Socialist  officials, after having been mobilized against this Marxist  party and urged to take revenge against its anti-Islam policy.  The Socialists have--more than once before--stressed that Sanaa  is giving military and material aid to a number of Yemeni  Afghans and mujahidin to carry out operations in the south and  to assassinate southern officials in the north. Undoubtedly the  Socialist Party, which is afraid of the repercussions from the  results achieved by the Reform Alliance in the recent  legislative elections, leading Shaykh 'Abdallah al-Ahmar to the  chairmanship of the Leadership Council, is even more afraid of a  fundamentalist intifadah in the south and the growth of  extremist Islamic movements.    The second factor is the split in the south caused by the  stirring up of so-called family sensitivities, or the return to  inciting the sultans against the Socialist Party, which has  nationalized the property of the wealthy and the sultans. At the  beginning of this year, the arrest of the sultan of Abyan, Tariq  al-Fadli, on the charge of assassinating 'Ali Salih 'Abbad, a  member of the Socialist Party's Political Office, stirred up a  crisis between Sanaa and Aden. In recent weeks, it was noted  that the sultans have returned to provocative activities and  intervention in the existing crisis. This clearly began when  Sultan Ahmad 'Abdallah al-Fadli, the previous sultan of Abyan,  sent a telegram to both President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and  Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar, in which he accused the  Socialist Party of working to separate south Yemen, after having  confirmed the existence of large oil reserves in its territory.    Perhaps the greatest danger that looms on the Yemeni horizon  today is the danger of resumption of tribal conflicts, with some  tribes bearing arms against others. Yemen lives today with the  fear of the historic conflict between the Hashid and Bakil  tribes. According to some, the visit to Aden by Shaykh Sinan  Abu-Luhum, who led a large delegation seeking to reconcile  points of view, was interference in an alliance between 'Ali  Salim al-Bid and the Bakil tribes in the north. These tribes are  well known for their animosity against the Hashid tribes, to  which President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Shaykh al-Ahmar belong.    Some observers believe that the Socialist Party is not  unlikely to react against Sanaa at the risk of a bloody war,  while security in the south is ensured, thanks to the domination  of the cohesive and ideological southern army, considered  militarily stronger than the army of the north.    In the last few weeks, it was noted that several tribes and  areas have begun to move into the line of conflict and that the  dangers of an explosion are increasing. The Hadramawt area, for  example, has severely criticized the north and has called for  local rule, broad powers, and the enjoyment of privatization.  That should be granted to it to make use of the more than 60  percent of Yemeni oil reserves that lie under its territory.  Despite the insistence at the Hadramawt meeting on rejecting  separation, observers think that this initiative is an indicator  that goes beyond putting pressure on Sanaa to save unity. As for  the Khawlan tribes that stress they are an indivisible part of  the Bakil, they have demanded participation in power,  commensurate with their size.  <H5>  Civil War </H5>   At this time, the mobilization campaign continues in the  south because of indicators that there is a threat of something  that is far beyond separation. This campaign intensified after  the assassination attempt in Aden against 'Ali Salim al-Bid's  sons, Nayif and Yusuf, and the assassination of his sister's  son. Al-Bid's sister waved her son's blood-splattered clothes in  his funeral procession, old southern revolutionary anthems were  played, and the blue and red-starred party flag waved. The  demonstrators shouted for revenge, calling for the return of  confrontation lines on the borders and for the bearing of arms  against the north, instead of continuing to live like beggars in  the unified Yemen. In fact, there is increasing talk about  arming the youth and readying armed militias among the citizens.    Together with that, media campaigns and the exchange of  accusations between the two sides continue. There are also  southerners returning to the north and northerners to the south,  along with military reinforcements and reports of arms and  experts arriving by this route or that. Observers expect tension  to increase during the next few days. They think that the south  will continue to work to propose a federation or confederation  as the ideal solution to avoid separation and return to  partition. However, Socialist Party leaders are convinced that  Sanaa will persist in a policy of no alternative to unity from  its own perspective, in order to impose domination over both the  north and south. These observers expect that, in the next phase,  the south will experience security disturbances and widespread  acts of assassination and abduction, accompanied by a  suffocating economic crisis. The purpose of this is to generate  a vast outcry for separation, which would be achieved. Then,  Sanaa would intervene. According to the latest information,  Sanaa has been arranging strong relations with southern tribes,  sultans, and fundamentalist movements. It has ended its  negotiations with the former southern president, Nasir Muhammad,  to host him in Sanaa, in an attempt to win over the last wave of  Socialist old-timers. However, Arab and foreign observers and  mediators, who have tried and are trying to obtain conciliation  and not allow matters to reach a point of no return, know full  well the dangers of continued escalation in this direction,  because that will ultimately lead to Yemen's getting into a  civil war, whose results and repercussions would be more  dangerous by far than all the wars that have previously been  fought by the people of this single country.</p>

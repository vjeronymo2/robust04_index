			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / International Company News: Bank of Boston slips to Dollars 73.6m BANK of Boston, a leading New England bank, yesterday reported fourth-quarter net profits of Dollars 73.6m, or 75 cents a share, down from Dollars 93.5m, or Dollars 1.15, a year ago. The bank stressed, however, that the level of its bad debt provisions had declined last year, in the fourth quarter to Dollars 10m from Dollars 78m a year before. The net profit level would have been just Dollars 56.6m in the quarter had it not been for a tax credit. For the whole of 1992, Bank of Boston's net income was Dollars 263.1m, or Dollars 2.84 a share, a substantial recovery when compared with a loss of Dollars 26.6m, or 53 cents, in 1991. The 1992 result was helped by Dollars 71m of tax credits carried forward from prior years. On Wall Street, the bank's share price closed Dollars  3/8 higher at Dollars 26 1/8 .</p>

			<p><P> December 25, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PANAMA: THE ROAD TO RECOVERY;  </P> <P> BUSH PLEASED, BUT PLOY MAY FORCE STALEMATE  </P> <P> President Bush said Sunday that he is pleased that Manuel A. Noriega sought  refuge in the Vatican embassy in Panama, declaring that it means that the  dictator's "reign of terror is over." But the wily general's move poses  potentially awkward problems for his pursuers.  </P> <P> In a worst-case scenario, officials said, it could produce a long and  embarrassing diplomatic stalemate that might result in his escape to another  country.  </P> <P> "I am pleased that the general is now under the control of diplomatic  authorities. His reign of terror is over," Bush said in a statement released by  White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. "As we work to help return law and  order to Panama City, and as the government of President (Guillermo) Endara  begins its work, the demise of Gen. Noriega sends a strong signal that freedom  and democracy in Panama are on the rise."  </P> <P> Fitzwater said the Administration is asking the Vatican to turn Noriega over to  U.S. or Panamanian authorities.  </P> <P> "The United States will continue to pursue avenues to bringing Gen. Noriega,  now located, to justice," he said.  </P> <P> He said officials are discussing how best to obtain the Vatican's agreement.  "That's what we're considering right now," he said. ". . . We have been in  touch with a number of officials relevant to this."  </P> <P> Under international law, embassies and other diplomatic missions have the right  to grant asylum to dissidents or others who seek refuge; U.S. forces cannot  pursue Noriega onto the embassy's premises.  </P> <P> But the Vatican's response was far from certain. According to an Italian news  agency report from Panama, the papal nuncio in Panama City, Bishop Jose  Sebastian Laboa, had already refused to turn Noriega over to the U.S. armed  forces who invaded the country last week.  </P> <P> "This is going to be a night of many questions and no answers," a weary White  House official said. "Everything remains open. We just want to bring him to  justice."  </P> <P> "There have been contacts on (several) levels between the U.S. and Vatican  officials in Washington as well as in Rome," a State Department official said.  </P> <P> "We don't expect a third country deal (under which Noriega would find refuge in  another country) to emerge," he said. "We expect that the Pope may have to be  in on the decision-making process."  </P> <P> He indicated that the Administration will try to persuade the pontiff that  Noriega's case "is different from other cases because it is not political, he  is not being persecuted for political reasons. He is a criminal just out to  save his skin."  </P> <P> The Pope himself did not hear the news of Noriega's arrival on his doorstep  until after celebrating Midnight Mass at St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican.  </P> <P> "There is nothing to say. Later today, we shall see," said Vatican spokesman  Joaquin Navarro.  </P> <P> Tradition might sway the Vatican to allow Noriega to escape. Vatican and other  foreign embassies in Latin America have been confronted by dozens of asylum  requests during the wars and revolutions of the past decade, and their most  frequent response has been to arrange safe passage out of the country.  </P> <P> Noriega has already been offered asylum in two countries, the Dominican  Republic and Spain, although those offers were made before the U.S. invasion of  Panama last week. In 1988, the Reagan Administration offered the general safe  passage to one of those countries if he would voluntarily relinquish power, an  offer Noriega walked away from.  </P> <P> The issue is complicated by the fact that the United States is asking for  Noriega to be handed over to U.S. authorities for trial before a federal court  in Florida -- not to Panamanian authorities.  </P> <P> "It's not clear exactly what the situation is, either diplomatically or  legally, at this time," said David Runkel, a special assistant to Atty. Gen.  Dick Thornburgh. "Our interest remains the same -- bringing this man to trial  in the United States if that's possible."  </P> <P> However, earlier Sunday, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney raised the possibility  that the United States might agree to allow Noriega to be prosecuted in Panama  instead. Panama normally does not allow its citizens to be extradited to the  United States.  </P> <P> "If he were to be captured in Panama and arrested, then I suppose we'd have to  sit down at that point and decide whether he was going to be brought back to  the United States, extradited if you will, or whether he would be prosecuted in  Panama," Cheney said on ABC's "This Week With David Brinkley."  </P> <P> Much will depend on the attitude of the Endara government, officials said. The  Vatican was one of the first countries to extend tacit recognition to the  Endara government; the papal nuncio, Bishop Jose Sebastian Laboa, met with  Endara last week.  </P> <P> Ironically, Endara himself took refuge at the nuncio's residence until shortly  before the U.S. invasion last week.  </P> <P> Even if Noriega settles in for a long stay, some State Department officials  consoled themselves with the thought that it might be better than the  alternative.  </P> <P> "Look at it this way," said one. "It's not the worst-case scenario. He could be  out in the hills, leading a guerrilla movement of resistance against the U.S.  occupation. This way, at least he's admitted that he's a fugitive from  justice."  </P> <P> A group of senior State Department officials was meeting Sunday evening to  consider the Administration's legal and diplomatic options, officials said.  </P> <P> The officials reportedly included Undersecretary of State Robert M. Kimmitt,  Assistant Secretary of State Bernard W. Aronson and Legal Adviser Abraham  Sofaer.  </P> <P> Because of the Christmas holiday, President Bush and his senior advisers were  out of Washington, with Bush at the presidential retreat at Camp David, Md.,  and Secretary of State James A. Baker III visiting his family in Houston.  Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney was visiting American troops in Panama.  </P> <P> The United States has frequently extended asylum in its embassies to prominent  dissidents in Communist countries -- sometimes for long periods. Chinese  dissident Fang Lizhi has been living in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing since June,  although Chinese authorities seek him for treason. In the 1950s, the U.S.  Embassy in Budapest, Hungary, sheltered Cardinal Josef Mindszenty, the Catholic  primate of Hungary, for 15 years.  </P> <P> The concept of diplomatic asylum is different from the sanctuary that churches  provided to fugitives in medieval days. Asylum in embassies in generally  provided solely to political dissidents. "The ancient concept is that a church  provides sanctuary." said the Rev. George Regas, rector of All Saints Episcopal  Church in Pasadena, who has been active in the modern sanctuary movement,  providing shelter to emigrants from Central America.  </P> <P> "It usually is not sanctuary for someone fleeing from the law as it is for  someone who is obeying a higher law out of conscience. Noriega does not fit  that bill, I don't think. So the church would have to decide on what grounds it  would give sanctuary. It's a very complicated legal issue."  </P> <P> Staff writer William D. Montalbano in Rome contributed to this story, as did  staff writers John M. Broder, James Gerstenzang, Robert L. Jackson, Jill  Stewart and Robin Wright in Washington.  </P></p>

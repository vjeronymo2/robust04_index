			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INSTEAD OF WORRYING ABOUT DEFENSE FIRMS, LET'S REBUILD OUR TATTERED  INFRASTRUCTURE  </P> <P> If ever a writer was guilty of ignoring the forest for the trees, Jon B. Kutler  must stand convicted ("Downsizing America's Defense Industry," Jan. 21). Kutler  argues that with the prospect of a shrinking defense budget, aerospace  corporations should consider ways to "consolidate" their research and  production efforts with each other.  </P> <P> He bemoans the fact that the Reagan Administration did not encourage this  trend, and now the defense industry will find itself shut out in the face of  the new social and economic realities of a world moving toward peace.  </P> <P> If that is indeed the case, the issue is not how to "downsize" the defense  industry, but how to recycle the billions of tax dollars wasted on destructive  weapons into productive, politically responsible spending on social needs.  </P> <P> Military spending has made a serious casualty of domestic social and structural  needs. While the weapons makers were busily experimenting with their new  formulas and destructive toys, the nation's infrastructure was going to pot;  schools, hospitals, libraries, highways, bridges and transportation systems  were decaying. The industrial work force was rapidly shrinking as $18-an-hour  auto and steel workers suddenly found themselves competing for lower-wage  service and fast-food jobs. This in turn spawned a wide array of social  problems from drugs and crime to illiteracy that plague us today.  </P> <P> With the window of peace opening wider each day, the defense industry has a  golden opportunity to channel at least a portion of its prodigious technical  skills and resources toward reconstruction of our nation's social institutions  rather than destruction of mythical enemies.  </P> <P> EARL OFARI HUTCHINSON  </P> <P> Inglewood  </P></p>

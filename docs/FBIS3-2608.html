			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 8 (XINHUA) -- Starting next month,  the Chinese Government will collect a fee on the mining of  China's mineral resources from all mining enterprises, including  those involving foreign investment.    Implementation of the "Regulations on the Collection of  Mineral Resources Compensation Fee" begins April 1, in  accordance with an order issued by Premier Li Peng on February  27.    The regulations were approved by the State Council on June  29, 1993, said Song Ruixiang, executive vice-minister of the  Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources, at a news briefing  today.    The fee will be calculated on the basis of the value of the  minerals mined, but for the next year or two will be fixed at  1.18 percent "in consideration of the financial difficulties of  some mining enterprises."    The rate will be raised to 5-7 percent between 1996 and  2000,  and then to about ten percent. "Ten percent is what it should  be," the official said.    The "eventual rate" resulted from calculations on the value  of 21 mineral ores including gold, manganese and phosphorus.  "Even ten percent is lower than such rates in foreign  countries," the official said.    At the rate of 1.18 percent, the government expects to  collect an annual average of one billion yuan and use it on  geological prospecting, "especially prospecting involving risks  and involving resources for China's strategic reserves," he said.    Even more important, however, is that collection of the fee  is meant to uphold state ownership of mineral resources in  accordance with the constitution and the "mineral resources law"  and make such ownership real by an economic method, Song said.    "Unpaid-for mining means free transfer of state property  rights to a mining enterprise, and this does not conform to law  and causes loss of state-owned assets," Song said.    "All countries collect mineral resources compensation fees  in  one or another form," he noted. "Moreover, the market economy  necessitates compensation for the consumption of mineral  resources."    In their overseas operations, Chinese mining companies duly  pay mineral resources compensation fees in observation of laws  of their host countries, Song noted.    "Foreign companies seeking investment opportunities in  China's mining sector agree to pay such a fee, which demands  that there be legislation on its collection," the official said.    The latest State Council regulations cover "mineral  resources  of all types throughout China, on China's land territory and  within the maritime territory under China's jurisdiction."    All mining enterprises have to pay the fee, whether they are  owned by the state, or collectively or individually owned and  whether they involve foreign investment.    In line with government decrees previously published,  foreign  companies engaging in oil and natural gas operations in China,  onshore or offshore, will continue to turn over to China a  prescribed percentage of the products as fees on the use of the  operation areas.</p>

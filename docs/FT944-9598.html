			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Observer: Loose cannon Karl Lamers, foreign policy spokesman for the Christian Democrats in the German Bundestag, is fast turning into Chancellor Kohl's unguided missile. Lamers wants to set up a 'hard core' of states at the centre of Europe and forge ahead with European federalism, much to the irritation of several European governments. One of those least happy is his own. Bonn's finance ministry takes exception to Lamers' suggestion that France, Germany and the Benelux countries will automatically form the 'core' of European monetary union. Londoners have the chance to hear for themselves when Lamers brings his federalist roadshow to town on Thursday, speaking at the Royal Institute of International Affairs and the European think-tank, Federal Trust. Will he tone down his federalism once at the heart of Euroscepticism? Let's hope not; some snap, crackle and pop would make a nice change.</p>

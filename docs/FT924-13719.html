			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / UK Company News: William Sinclair advances nine years in a row TURNOVER, profits and dividend have increased for the ninth year in succession, said Mr Tom Sinclair, chairman of William Sinclair Holdings, which supplies products to the garden leisure and pet markets. For the year to June 30 it reported a 3 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 4.48m to Pounds 4.61m. Mr Sinclair said that gardening was less vulnerable to recession than other leisure activities and Mr Peter Barton, managing director, pointed to the ageing population profile and 'green' awareness as other factors in the group's resilience. The shares rose 13p to 209p. Turnover grew 13 per cent to Pounds 36.5m (Pounds 32.3m) and interest receivable fell to Pounds 345,000 (Pounds 448,000). A dividend of 5.3p makes a total of 7p (6.7p). The garden leisure and professional horticulture side lifted turnover to Pounds 24.7m (Pounds 23.2m), but saw trading profits slip to Pounds 2.89m (Pounds 2.96m). Pet, aquatic and household products lifted profits to Pounds 799,000 (Pounds 415,000) on turnover up at Pounds 7.16m (Pounds 4.49m) after the acquisition of King British and UNO, two aquatic companies, in 1991. In April the group acquired Secto for an initial Pounds 5m and a deferred Pounds 1.6m. Profits in the garden sundries and Silvaperl Industrial division slipped to Pounds 579,000 (Pounds 659,000) on flat turnover. Farmer Foster, the trellis and garden furniture maker, was closed since the period-end and provisions of Pounds 411,000 were taken as extraordinary items. The group has now been reorganised from three into two divisions. Earnings fell to 15.7p (17.2p) on capital increased 11.9 per cent by the Secto acquisition.</p>

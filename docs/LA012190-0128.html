			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAPANESE LOBBY  </P> <P> If anyone had ever predicted that I'd concur with Buchanan on any issue, I  would have shaken my head with a smile of disbelief.  </P> <P> I do, however, totally share his anger with the U.S. firms, universities, think  tanks and ex-U.S. officials now serving as public relations  representatives/lobbyists for Japanese interests in the United States.  </P> <P> Buchanan calls William Eberle, Charles Manatt, William Brock III, Robert  Strauss and other kowtowers to the Rising Sun "mercenaries." I call them  traitors.  </P> <P> MICHELE MOONEY  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

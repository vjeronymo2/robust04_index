			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> EC AIDE WARNS JAPAN ON BARRIERS  </P> <P> A senior European Community official said that Japan's trade barriers are  costing European producers $3 billion a year in lost exports and warned that if  the obstacles remain, they could hurt Japan's auto exports to the EC.  </P> <P> Horst Krenzler, director-general of external relations and trade policy, spoke  at a news conference today after two days of high-level talks with Japanese  officials on trade, economic problems and science and technology.  </P> <P> "We pleaded strongly that Japan push forward with more market-opening. Only  this would create a favorable climate to solve other problems such as auto  imports into the EC after the single market in 1992," Krenzler said.  </P> <P> He said the EC's chronic trade deficit with Japan was intolerable and that  Japan's response in the talks had been disappointing. No concrete steps had  been taken to remove Japanese obstacles to imports, he said.  </P> <P> EC figures show the Japanese trade surplus with the Community in the first nine  months of the year was $13.1 billion, compared with a $19.8-billion surplus in  all of 1989.  </P> <P> The EC wants Japan to abolish the trade restrictions and cut import tariffs on  processed food, fish products and leather.  </P></p>

			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Japan launches deregulation plan: Proposals aim to increase competition and cut business costs Japan's caretaker administration announced a 279-point deregulation plan for the economy yesterday. It will be presented at next week's summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations as evidence that the country is continuing to open its markets. The plan, for adoption by a new cabinet, aims to increase competition and reduce business costs in housing, telecommunications, imports and distribution, and financial markets. It is the third and most concrete package in a deregulation drive started last year by Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, then prime minister. Provisions include: Recognising foreign inspection data on a range of imports including cars, pharmaceuticals and construction materials rather than insisting on expensive tests in Japan. Relaxing zoning restrictions for new buildings. Making it easier for private-sector telephone services to connect to the public system. Permitting the creation of certain derivative financial products. The measures include no mention of tax reform, an issue that has been blocked by the political impasse after the collapse this month of the minority government led by Mr Tsumotu Hata. Japanese business welcomed the fresh step towards liberalising the economy, but the country's leading trade partners can be expected to be disappointed by the stalemate on tax reform. Tentative government plans for a cut in income taxes are seen as vital to supporting Japan's fragile recovery, even at the cost of the proposed subsequent rise in consumption tax. The Social Democratic party, the second-largest opposition group, reopened talks with Mr Hata's coalition yesterday after lack of progress in talks with the main opposition Liberal Democrats. It was unclear when or if they could reach a conclusion. A theoretical deadline is midnight today, the end of the present session of parliament, which must select the new prime minister. However, it looked last night as if the session would have to be extended. None of the three main main blocs in Japanese politics - the Hata coalition, the SDP and the LDP - has enough parliamentary seats to dictate terms for forming a new government. Mr Yohei Kono, LDP president, pleaded with Mr Tomiichi Murayama, SDP chairman, to make up his mind which side to join. SDP policies - such as support for North Korea, its insistence that Japan's security treaty with the US is unconstitutional, its opposition to a rise in consumption tax, and caution over deregulation - clash with those of the LDP and the coalition. Yet neither the LDP nor the coalition, in their present form, can command a parliamentary majority without the SDP. Mr Murayama and at least half the SDP's members of parliament believe they would lose voters and their chances of returning to government if the party abandoned its traditional policies.</p>

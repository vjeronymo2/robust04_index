			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / MP leads activist warning on Blair Ms Liz Lynne, the Liberal Democrat MP for Rochdale, yesterday put herself at the head of a fringe group of the party which is unwilling to see any rapprochement with Labour before the next election, James Blitz writes. Amid deep divisions among Liberal Democrats over how they should approach Mr Tony Blair, the new Labour leader, Ms Lynne told a fringe meeting at the Brighton conference she was opposed to initiating talks between the parties. Arguing that Labour remained dominated by old-style socialists, she said: 'I don't think Tony Blair will be able to deliver. He hasn't put any flesh on his policies.' Her comments were warmly received by about 150 Liberal Democrat activists attending a meeting of the Urban Campaign Network, which aims to co-ordinate the Liberal Democrat campaign against Labour in inner-city areas. The strong support shown for Ms Lynne will serve as a warning to Mr Paddy Ashdown not to hint at a rapprochement with Labour in his keynote speech today if he is to keep his party united. The strong opposition towards Labour among Liberal Democrat councillors is not shared by most of the parliamentary party.</p>

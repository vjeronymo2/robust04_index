			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Shift in spread of SE listings LONDON AND south-east England continued to lose companies quoted on the Stock Exchange to the recession in 1992-93, shifting the balance of where quoted companies are located in Britain. According to BWD Rensburg, the quoted Huddersfield-based stockbroker, Britain's regions had 666 quoted companies in June. There were gains in the regions where greater economic resilience has brought more new quotations than those lost through receivership, administration, takeovers or mergers. London lost a net 23 quoted companies - 13 new listings compared with 36 losses of Stock Exchange quotations. Its latest total is 505 companies. The rest of the south-east also lost 23 listings - five gains to 28 losses - with its total falling to 337. More than half of the quoted companies outside the south-east are in three regions: Yorkshire and Humberside, the west Midlands - they have 125 each - and north-west England, where there are 111. Scotland gained five listings but lost three to reach its total of 70. South-west England gained four and lost none to record 68. The east Midlands lost four but gained only three, slipping to 66 listings. Of the remaining quoted companies in the regions 37 were in East Anglia and 34 in the north-east and Cumbria - each region was up one from three gains and two losses during the year. There were 21 in Wales, where three listings were lost and none gained. BWD's analysis shows 216 companies in the FTSE Small Capitalised companies index are in the regions, compared with 103 in London and 90 in the rest of the south-east. Quarterly Review.

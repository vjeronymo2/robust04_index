			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 15 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li  Peng said today that China has a sufficient grain reserve, but  there should not be, in the slightest degree, any relaxation on  grain production.    Li Peng made the remark when he joined deputies to the  National People's Congress (NPC) in a group discussion on the  government work report he delivered March 10.    Talking with NPC deputies respectively from Henan and  Heilongjiang Provinces, both leading grain producers in China,  the premier said that rural reform in the past 15 years have  brought about great changes in the countryside, especially the  development of township enterprises.    As a result, many farmer-turned entrepreneurs have emerged,  of whom majority are good and trust-worthy. But a small number  of them have become degenerate and some even have committed  crimes, Li added.    Without being supervised by the party and the masses, some  people may easily make major mistakes when they have power and  money. This is the case not only among farmer-turned  entrepreneurs, but also among party officials, Li Peng said.    Li Peng urged party committees at all levels to protect and  help and the masses to supervise the entrepreneurs. The  entrepreneurs, at the same time, should enhance their awareness  of law.    The premier also discussed with deputies on how to change  the  way state-owned enterprises operate. When conditions are  mature, enterprises groups should be set up to build up the  production scale. Efficiency of an enterprise lies in finding  markets for its products, the premier added.    In response to deputies' proposals on smooth implementation  of new reform measures, Li Peng said that all these measures  have undergone careful consideration before they are introduced  and they are aimed to create a climate in which all compete on  an equal footing.    Of course, the premier said, people should not expect that  the measures will effect all their benefits this year as some  problems may occur in the process of implementation. The only  correct attitude is to be prudent and promptly solve problems  when they are discovered.    As for saving energy, Li Peng said continuous efforts should  be made to improve energy utility efficiency since energy supply  is still a bottleneck for the country.</p>

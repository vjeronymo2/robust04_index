			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Armenians say 36 killed in Azerbaijan THE Armenian government has accused the Soviet authorities of promoting a 'war' between it and neighbouring Azerbaijan after 36 people were reported killed in an attack on an Armenian-populated village in Azerbaijan. The attack by Soviet and Azerbaijani interior troops on the village of Getashen in the Soviet republic of Azerbaijan also left hundreds wounded, according to Armenian government officials. The village, with a population of 3,000, is close to the Armenian-populated enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan, which Armenia has demanded should come under its control. The dispute has cost more than 200 lives in the past three years. Fighting has also been reported along the Armenian/Azerbaijani border in the southern Caucasus, from the Noyemberyansky district in the north to the Gorisky district in the south. Fighting is now going on in or between all three of the Soviet Caucasian republics. In Georgia, clashes between Georgian and Ossetians in South Ossetia are said to be increasing. The murderous ethnic feuds are fuelling demands by hardliners for President Mikhail Gorbachev to declare a state of emergency. 'In mountainous Karabakh, in the Shahumian region, in the Getashen district, and on the Azerbaijan-Armenia border there now exists a state of war,' the Armenian parliament statement said. Communist officials were ejected from the Armenian Communist party central committee building in Yerevan yesterday, according to the official news agency Tass. This followed a decision last month by the Armenian supreme soviet to nationalise party property.</p>

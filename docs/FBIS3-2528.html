			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 10 (XINHUA) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of  the National People's Congress Standing Committee, shook hands  with Vice President Rong Yiren as soon as he entered a lounge in  the Great Hall of the People shortly before the current session  of the National People's Congress opened this morning.    Qiao sat down beside Mr. Ann Tse-kai, a vice chairman of the  National Committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference (CPPCC). He asked whether Mr. Ann is  used to living in Beijing after coming from Hong Kong.    Qiao began talking with Ann about the issue of resuming  China's sovereignty over Hong Kong. "Our stand has been  consistent on the Hong Kong question," he said.    "The British side should be held entirely responsible for  the  breakdown of the Sino-British talks on the Hong Kong question,"  Qiao said.    "We shall never waver in our determination to resume China's  sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997," he said.    Speaking of the current NPC session, Qiao Shi pledged to  speed up legislation, tighten supervision over government work  and standardize a socialist market economic structure.    At 8:50 A.M., President Jiang Zemin entered the lounge and  sat down beside Li Ruihuan, chairman of the CPPCC National  Committee. The two leaders talked about how to promote  ideological and cultural progress in China.    They were soon joined by Vice Premier and Foreign Minister  Qian Qichen, who told president Jiang: "The United Nations  Commission on Human Rights has voted down an anti-China motion  raised by some countries."    Jiang said, "It is unpopular to attack China by using the  human rights issue. We should justly and forcefully refute such  attacks."    Premier Li Peng, who had just come in, said, "I'm going to  state our stand on this matter in the government work report."    President Jiang said: "Right!" Speaking of the current NPC  session, Jiang said, "At present the overall situation in China  is excellent. All major policies and principles have been  formulated. The key to success lies in earnest, concerted  endeavors by people of all nationalities."    Shortly before leaving for the rostrum to deliver his  government work report, premier Li Peng told reporters that Deng  Xiaoping has always advocated concise, pragmatic reports.    "This year's government work report highlights reform,  economic development and social stability," he said.    "I hope that, during the current session, NPC deputies and  CPPCC National Committee members will speak their minds and air  their views on how to revise my report," he said.    The premier was joined by Li Ruihuan, who said: "Reform  serves as the motive force, development is our goal and  stability is a prerequisite."    "So long as we correctly handle relations between reform,  development and stability, and work hard and in unity, we will  be invincible," he added.</p>

Boronin, Institute of Microorganism  Biochemistry and Physiology at Russia's Academy of Sciences,  Pushchino; UDC 579.843.21:579]    [Abstract] Interest in lactobacilli and their applications  in the food industry, medicine, and agriculture prompted a study  of lactobacilli plasmids from the viewpoint of their development  of properties and traits as well as their use as potential  cloning vectors. To this end, the structural and functional  properties of the pBS195 plasmid, including physical and genetic  mapping, are examined, and the protein products determined by  the pBS195 plasmid are studied. The ability of the pBS195  plasmid to coexist with a broad range of hosts, both  gram-positive and gram-negative, is noted, and the areas  containing the kanamycin and oriV resistance genes are  localized. The study reveals no homology of the kanamycin  resistance determinants of the pBS195 plasmid with the  determinants which control aminoglycoside of types I and II  phosphotransferase and type II nucleotidyl transferase. It is  speculated that in contrast to other plasmids, the pBS195  contains a rep-system homologous with pUC19 which supports it in  E. coli cells. Two 26 and 34 kD protein products were  discovered by electrophoretic separation in the system of  E. coli X295 minicells containing the pBS195 plasmid.  The oxygenase activity determined by the pBS195 plasmid is  discussed, and it is noted that enzyme is unusually  substrate-specific and highly active in E. coli cells  determined by the pBS195 plasmid. The plasmid shares homology  with the nahC gene in the EcoRI-BamHI region. It is emphasized  that the functional role of the oxygenase determined by the  pBS195 for the host cells remains unclear.

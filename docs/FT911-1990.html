			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: MacSharry urges ban on 'angel dust' A HORMONE which rapidly increases the meat content of cattle, 'angel dust,' should be banned according to Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner. Mr MacSharry, while stressing that this was his personal view and not yet EC policy, said he hoped to get a ban on clembuterol, one of a group of hormones known as beta agonists, tacked on to the price package working its way glacially through the council of farm ministers. Although the EC banned the use of hormones to increase the yield of beef stock in 1988, 'angel dust' is allowed for therapeutic purposes, mainly fertility in cows. Evidence has emerged of growing abuse of clembuterol to reduce fat levels and increase meat content. Cases have come to light in Ireland and Belgium particularly. Commission officials say the problem is not widespread, but risks turning consumers - already chary of beef because of the 'mad cow' scare - further against bovine meat. Angel dust, which gets to farmers through black marketeers copying the tactics of drugs traffickers, produces meat which is leathery and tasteless.</p>

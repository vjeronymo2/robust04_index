			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A HAVEN FOR GAY TEENS  </P> <P> I only want to dispute Lou Sheldon's remark that the program should be ended  because it does not give the gay student "any other alternative viewpoint."  </P> <P> I realize this man is no Einstein, but give me a break. When we are constantly  bombarded by half-naked heterosexual couples selling us everything from  suppositories to life insurance, I believe there are enough suggestions of  alternative life styles. With 3,000 teen-agers getting pregnant every day in  this country, I'd say the life style message is loud and clear.  </P> <P> I do agree with Sheldon when he asks, "Why should taxpayer's dollars support  only one life style?" Right on. I hope to see the man in the forefront of an  equal taxation law where, married or not, we all get the same breaks.  </P> <P> This society is geared to the heterosexual, and we are not allowed to forget it  for a minute.  </P> <P> JERRY KAYE  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

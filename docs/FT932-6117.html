			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Seriously Rich: Tale of the horsetrader who gambled everything - Michael Thompson-Noel describes how Robert Sangster and Vincent O'Brien found the key to the bloodstock market WHEN racehorse owner Robert Sangster and trainer Vincent O'Brien first set eyes on The Minstrel at the Keeneland yearling sales, Kentucky, in July 1975, they were not sure what to make of him. The Minstrel was a son of the great Canadian sire, Northern Dancer, and that they liked. And The Minstrel had tremendous self-assurance, and that they liked. But he was small and chestnut-coloured and also flashy, with four white stockings and a big white blaze. In the multi-billion lottery of international horse racing, the colour of a yearling's coat and the number of white feet he has, let alone his size and deportment in the auction ring, are not just trifles. They may be crucial. Millions may be at stake, for there is a feeling among experts that the chestnut colour in racehorses signifies petulance and temper, while four white stockings are almost a taboo. According to a just-published book about Sangster, Horsetrader, by Patrick Robinson, O'Brien said nothing when The Minstrel was first brought out for him at the Keeneland barns. 'He stared quietly into the yearling's eye,' writes Robinson. 'And the little horse stood stock still, staring back. Vincent smiled at him, pulled his ear gently, ran his hand down the horse's neck . . . 'He's more than 14.1 hands,' he said. 'But not much. He could just be big enough, but only just'.' In the auction ring, Sangster and his syndicate bought The Minstrel for Dollars 200,000. They thought they had got a bargain because, alone of all the yearlings O'Brien had studied, it was The Minstrel that had 'spoken' to him. On the flight from the US to O'Brien's Ballydoyle training complex in Ireland, most of the yearlings O'Brien and his clients had purchased that week were restless and nervous. Some were dark with sweat. But none of this applied to the robust little chestnut colt that could only just angle his head over the front of his travelling box to get at his hay-net. There was no sound from The Minstrel - just a steady munching. Two years later The Minstrel won the English Derby, hard ridden by Lester Piggott who thwacked and thwacked him with the whip over the last quarter of a mile. The Minstrel won by a neck. O'Brien was trembling as the little champion crossed the line. O'Brien's wife was in tears. Sangster was in shock. In the next few weeks The Minstrel won the Irish Derby and then the mid-summer European middle-distance championship, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes, at Ascot. Following which he was shipped back to the US, to Maryland, with a price tag of Dollars 9m around his handsome - chestnut - neck. The tale of The Minstrel is one among hundreds of stories that help maintain the momentum of Horsetrader, one of the most riveting books about international horse racing ever published - impressively well-researched, exciting and well-written. More, it takes us inside the mind of a man who inherited substantial wealth (the Vernons Pools business) and then parlayed those riches into a horse-owing and breeding empire. Usually an intensely private man, Sangster has never before allowed his fantasies and motivations, as well as the mechanics of his assault on the racing world, to come under such scrutiny. One of the key players in the syndicate that Sangster formed with O'Brien was the great Irish bloodstock expert John Magnier, who in 1974 spelled out a winning strategy to take on the world of thoroughbred breeding by the neck and shake loose the key of gold. Sangster and Magnier were at Goodwood, enjoying a quiet drink after watching a tough US-bred colt by Vaguely Noble named Ace of Aces, owned by the Dallas billionaire Nelson Bunker Hunt, humble the best milers in England to win the Sussex Stakes. ''Look at that,' said Magnier. 'You could have bought him as a yearling for Dollars 30,000. Now he'll probably be syndicated for upwards of Dollars 2m to go back to Kentucky. I'm wondering if that might not be the answer: to raid the sales in the US for yearlings, which cost one-twentieth of the price of stallions, and hope to get it right once every four or five times. That way we'd own the stallions before they retired - and no one could get them away from us.' Specifically, they tried to corner the market in the offspring of Northern Dancer - a shrewd ploy and one that brought them many triumphs. In the years that followed, Sangster, O'Brien, Magnier and their rich friends raided the US yearling sales. The value of the bloodstock that has passed through Sangster's hands from the mid-1970s to the present undoubtedly exceeds Dollars 1bn. But the good times could not last. In the early 1980s various oil-rich Arab owners, especially the Maktoum family of Dubai, moved into the market. Their money spouted from the ground. As a result, they made life extremely difficult for mere multi-millionaires like Sangster and his partners. To complicate things further, in the late 1980s the racehorse market nosed into decline - yearling and stallion values collapsed, owners withdrew, breeding studs went bust. But Sangster is still in business, these days as a commercial horsebreeder. In 1992 he enjoyed heartfelt success with the classic-winning Rodrigo de Triano, which he eventually sold for Dollars 6.2m cash to the Japanese in the absence of a comparable offer from the UK. 'As I have always stressed,' said Sangster, 'the strength of a big investment in thoroughbred horses is its global appeal. There's always someone, somewhere, who will have the money for a classic stallion prospect. I am a horsetrader, and right now I'm very happy with my situation.' According to Patrick Robinson, Sangster's racing forays were based, back in the 1970s, on a start-up investment of about Pounds 2m. At the height of the market boom in 1984 and 1985, Sangster's bloodstock interests were probably worth approaching Dollars 350m worldwide. 'There were bank loans to be serviced, of course,' writes Robinson, 'but these were settled upon the sale of Vernons Pools. Even as the market crashed further, in the 1990s, his accountants assiduously calculated the value of Robert's international bloodstock empire, and on the day Rodrigo de Triano wrapped up the British season the figure stood at a conservative Dollars 157m - a quite remarkable total given the world bloodstock recession and the wildly fluctuating values of breeding stallions.' Last season, Sangster banked close to Pounds 1.5 in prizemoney, which paid for the bulk of his racing and training expenses. And he sold Dollars 20m worth of yearlings. At least 50 yearlings he had bred were on their way to his own training complex in England. And in Ireland, the mares he owns were preparing to produce almost 100 foals. Occasionally, says Robinson, Sangster, O'Brien and Magnier still get together in Ireland. They can be seen at the top of the Ballydoyle gallops, watching the horses work. 'Their talk always seems a bit conspiratorial, their laughter private to themselves, a certain remoteness suggesting they have much to say, but only to each other. It is perhaps the type of close camaraderie which settles only upon men who have fought many battles together. Somehow these three diverse personalities had made the lunatic world of the thoroughbred racehorse actually work, profitably and with dazzling success. At times they had gambled everything . . .'

			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / 'Quangoland' of Wales warned MR JOHN REDWOOD, the Welsh secretary, warned chairmen of Welsh quangos yesterday that the public expected national boards to maintain the 'highest standards of probity and fairness'. He said: 'I look to all the chairmen to lead, by insisting on the highest standards of conduct.' He said if things did go wrong 'the public likes an early apology from the board and is entitled to expect that disciplinary action will be taken if necessary'. Mr Redwood told chairmen of Welsh non-departmental public bodies that there were limits to the number of functions which could best be handled by quangos - quasi-autonomous non-governmental bodies. He added: 'Many services require either the direct political control and accountability of local government or the Welsh Office. I do not want Quangoland to grow too fat on functions transferred from local government.' His comments come a few weeks after the publication of a highly critical report by the Commons public accounts committee about the internal management of the Welsh Development Agency. The investigation followed concerns raised by the National Audit Office about the WDA's 1991-92 accounts. In a report published today, the audit office condemns the way in which another quango, the Development Board for Rural Wales, allocated housing under a secret set of rules separate to those which were made public. It says the board's own housing officer was involved in allocating houses to himself and his former wife when neither was eligible under the published rules.</p>

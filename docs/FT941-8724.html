			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Split hearings on airport projects The government has refused to combine planning inquiries into the expansion of Manchester and Liverpool airports - making it more difficult for Manchester's proposed second runway to be scrapped in favour of developing Liverpool's airport at Speke. It means Manchester's ambition to cater for 30m passengers a year by early next century will be considered alone at a planning inquiry later this year. The second runway - broadly supported by most of northern England's political and business leaders - is opposed by residents and local politicians, as well as environmental groups. The airport was used by 13.4m passengers last year, when it opened a Pounds 265m second terminal. Annual growth is running at about 12 per cent - and at 18 per cent for passengers using international scheduled flights. A second runway would take it past its present capacity of 17m passengers a year. Liverpool airport is used by fewer than 500,000 passengers a year. Supported by Merseyside councils and business, it has tabled expansion plans which depend on capping Manchester's growth and forcing airlines to use Liverpool. With about 1,000 jobs created in and around airports for every 1m extra passengers, Liverpool's backers argue that the worsening economic imbalance between Merseyside and Greater Manchester might be reduced if the 'north's second runway' were at Speke.</p>

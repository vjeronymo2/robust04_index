			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Lefkose], Feb 8 (AA) -- President Rauf Denktas of the  Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus said on Tuesday [8 February]  that the whole of Cyprus can not enter to European Union (EU)  before we say "yes."    Denktas, evaluating EU's message to Greek Cypriots which  said  if the concerned sides reach an agreement, pre-studies will  begin on Cyprus' membership to the EU, said the two sides living  in Cyprus should hold separate referendums on the issue and  should apply for the Union's membership.    Denktas answering questions on the issue said accepting  Greek  Cypriots as the responsible "nation" was a mistake adding that  the whole Cyprus cannot enter to EU before an agreement between  the two sides.</p>

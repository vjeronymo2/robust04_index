			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed WV: "Belgian Consumers Just as Optimistic as </F> Other Europeans"]    [Text] The confidence of the Belgian consumer has increased  more over the last two months than in the rest of the European  Union (EU). In March, Belgium's confidence index rose to minus  22 compared to minus 25 in January, while in the EU it rose to  minus 22 from minus 24. As a result, for the first time since  March last year, the Belgian consumer is just as optimistic as  the average European.    This is the picture which emerges from the figures for  February and March recently published by the EU. The EU  organizes a monthly "harmonized EU survey among the Union's  consumers" in order to determine a consumer confidence index. As  part of this survey, 20,000 consumers are interviewed. In  Belgium, the survey is conducted by the Dimarso agency.    The sharp rise in consumer confidence in Belgium since the  end of last year suggests that the economic recovery which began  in the second quarter of last year is lasting and balanced.  Household consumption largely determines the level of demand in  the economy, representing more than 60 percent of the GDP.    Some economists were concerned at the end of last year  because at that time consumer confidence was not following the  increase in business confidence. Business confidence, as  assessed by the National Bank surveys, has been growing since  the summer of 1993. This confidence has had a strong impact on  the supply-side of the economy, that is production.    The relatively slow reaction among consumers was no doubt  due  to uncertainty regarding the crisis plan. The Dehaene  government announced a social pact in July, but was unable to  reach agreement with the social partners. This is why it opted  for a crisis plan, that was only finally completed in November.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Josef Moravcik by Maria </F> Hluchanova and Jan Pankovcikova; place and date not given: "We  Have Revived the Idea of Merging the Liberal Parties of the  Center"]    [Text] [SME] The Democratic Union [DU] has offered the  National Democratic Party (NDS) the opportunity to run on its  list of candidates in the elections. What made you take this  step?    [Moravcik] This is nothing new. We spoke with Mr. Cernak  and his colleagues a long time ago. We may not have reached an  agreement at that time, but it is a different situation now, and  we thought it was necessary to discuss once again the original  project, which is still attractive. The parties of the center  that are oriented more or less liberally should unite, and this  is why we have revived this idea.    [SME] Could you specify in what respect the situation is  new? Several weeks ago, the DU Republican Council presented a  final resolution of your party to run independently in the  elections, and Mr. Cernak discussed preelection cooperation with  the Christian Democratic Movement....    [Moravcik] We spoke about establishing a confederation of  parties of the center before the elections. There is not enough  time for this, however. Now, the opportunity has arisen to  reach agreement with the NDS on a joint list of candidates.    [SME] So, we were mistaken when we thought that the DU's  lists of candidates had been closed?    [Moravcik] They are not. Within our party, we agreed on the  leaders in the individual electoral regions.    [SME] The Democratic Union announced that it was open to  negotiations with the Democratic Party (DS)....    [Moravcik] Yes, we are fulfilling the project about which we  spoke--a gradual merger of the parties of the center. This is  important for Slovakia mainly from the viewpoint of the  crystallization of the political scene. We are trying, and will  try, to fill the center and the gap right of the center.  However, this will require more time than the time we have left  before the elections in the fall.    [SME] What places are you offering to the NDS and the DS on  your lists of candidates?    [Moravcik] The talks will continue. It is premature to  speak about it for the time being.</p>

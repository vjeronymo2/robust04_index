			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / Court move on Mitsotakis The Athens appeals court council has called for confidentiality rules to be lifted on bank accounts held by Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, the former Greek prime minister, as part of an investigation launched earlier this year into accusations that he took bribes while in office. Mr Mitsotakis is accused of accepting a Dollars 22.5m (Pounds 14.5m) bribe in the 1992 sale of Heracles General Cement, the state-owned Greek cement producer, to Cal-Nat, a joint venture between Calcestruzzi, the construction arm of Italy's Ferruzzi group, and National Bank of Greece. The Dr124bn (Pounds 337m) deal was the biggest privatisation carried out by Mr Mitsotakis' conservative government. Once the investigation is complete, the Socialist-controlled parliament will vote on whether to lift his immunity against prosecution. Mr Mitsotakis, now a backbencher, also faces charges of illegally tapping the telephones of political rivals while in office, in a case being pursued by deputies from the governing Panhellenic Socialist Movement.</p>

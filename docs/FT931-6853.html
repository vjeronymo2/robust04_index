			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / International Company News: European airlines to set up talks for global system FOUR European airlines - KLM, Swissair, Scandinavian Air System and Austrian Airlines - said yesterday they were ready to launch detailed talks on the feasibility of setting up a 'global airline system'. The airlines, which disclosed in late January they were considering opening formal talks, said they planned to examine how a possible partnership could be structured and how long it might take to get off the ground. They declined to give details or to say whether an equity link was likely, but indicated that all options remained open. Joint working groups have been set up to explore opportunities in more detail. 'A combined effort is essential to compete profitably with the current and anticipated heavy pressure on the European airline business from strong intercontinental airlines,' the four companies said in a joint statement. The partnership would be based on several European hubs, enabling traffic to be funnelled in and out of the airlines' home countries. The airlines said their ambition was to offer a global route network for passengers and cargo traffic. The move forward into official negotiations comes exactly a year after the breakdown of merger talks between KLM and British Airlines, which has gone on to take a 25 per cent stake in Qantas of Australia and to pursue a minority shareholding in USAir, the sixth-largest US carrier. Since the collapse of the BA talks, KLM - which owns a minority stake in Northwest of the US - has been searching for ways to boost its global and its European presence. Swissair, SAS and Austrian Airlines are already partners in a loose grouping called the European Quality Alliance, which involves joint marketing activities and flight time-tables.</p>

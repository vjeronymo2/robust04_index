			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] At the beginning of the bulletin we shall go over to  the Chamber of Deputies in Prague. Our correspondents Ivana  Anyzova and Milan Repka have been following today's developments  there.    [Repka] The speaker of the Polish Sejm, Jozef Oleksy, said  after the talks with Czech parliament speaker Milan Uhde that  Polish and Czech views of the integrational process into  European structures and of basic principles on which a united  Europe should be built were identical.    Jozef Oleksy went on to say that some media claims that the  Czech Republic did not favor regional cooperation within the  Visegrad Group were regarded as issues of no lesser importance  and that the Polish side expected to receive an answer to these  issues. Oleksy added that the explanation the Polish delegation  received in this respect was satisfactory.    Asked by Czech radio whether the Partnership for Peace  project was also discussed during the meeting with the Czech  parliament speaker Milan Uhde, Jozef Oleksy said that this issue  was discussed, too, and that, in his view, the Czech side's  approach to the signing of this agreement, which was already  signed by Poland, was rather cautious. In this connection it is  noteworthy, however, that Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus is to sign  this agreement on 10 March.    Answering a question by a Polish journalist as to whether  the  Polish delegation discussed also requests related to the return  of property to Polish associations, Speaker Oleksy replied that  he discussed this issue during all his official talks with the  Czech side.    [Anyzova] Regarding this issue, Czech Parliament Speaker  Milan Uhde told Czech radio that he did not recall that this  topic had been brought forward during his talks with the Polish  Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy in the Czech parliament today. Milan  Uhde then told Czech radio that although this issue has not been  officialy addressed, he himself was aware that some Polish,  mostly cultural associations active within the Polish national  minority, were claiming back the property, which was once  Polish, including the property of various legal entities which  was first of all confiscated from these associations by the  Germans. These associations claim that this property has been  returned neither by the Czechoslovak nor the Czech Government.    According to the speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, it is  not absolutely clear whether this issue goes back before  February 1948. In conclusion, Milan Uhde added that nobody on  the Czech side has considered this issue in detail so far.</p>

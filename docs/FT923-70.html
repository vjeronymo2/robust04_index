			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Foreign Affairs: Make-your-mind-up time - John Major cannot afford to put off the crucial decision on the UK's future role in Europe Foreign affairs, domestic politics, economic policy: the barriers between them have broken down. At this moment in British history, a commentator can no longer take refuge in his 'specialist' role. It is a time when choices have to be made. I am not qualified, in any specialist sense, to pass an economic judgment on Britain's membership of the European exchange rate mechanism. Nor would I deny that political ambitions are doomed to failure if they ignore economic realities. But I believe the choice facing the UK government in these crucial weeks is more important than any technical issue about the management of the exchange rate. Until two weeks ago Mr John Major's name stood for something, not only in Britain but in Europe: He was the chancellor who had persuaded the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher to bring the pound into the ERM. Too late, perhaps. At the wrong rate, it now seems almost certain. But he did it. He was the leader to whom his party turned when Mrs Thatcher's position, largely because of her anti-Europeanism, had become untenable. He was the prime minister who promised to put Britain at the heart of Europe, who forged a new working relationship with Chancellor Helmut Kohl, and who blessed the alliance of his party with the Christian Democrats in the European Parliament. Finally, he was the man who negotiated and accepted the Maastricht treaty. Admittedly he did so in the run-up to a general election, with many anxious backward glances. He earned, in those negotiations, the sobriquet of 'true Euro-sceptic' bestowed on him last weekend by Mr Tristan Garel-Jones. He fought, in alliance with the French government, to expunge all traces of federalism from the proposed European Union, thereby ensuring that it would be less democratic and probably less effective than it might have been. He insisted on reserving Britain's final decision on joining the monetary union until a later stage in the process. And he set his face so firmly against any social dimension of the Union that, in the words of one Conservative MEP: 'If they'd put a blank sheet of paper headed Social Chapter in front of him and left him to fill it in for himself, he still wouldn't have signed it.' This, of course, was so that he could return to London claiming victory. 'Game, set and match for Britain,' he proclaimed, making many of us wince. But it was all good politics: a means to the end of ensuring that Britain was at last accepted by the rest of the EC as a wholehearted, if sometimes difficult, partner. Now that achievement has been, to say the least, thrown into doubt. It is not all Mr Major's fault. He was not helped by the Danish referendum result  -though with hindsight he must surely regret not pressing on regardless with Britain's parliamentary ratification process and getting it out of the way. He was not helped by President Francois Mitterrand's decision to hold a referendum in France, which may have seemed like a purely procedural issue in early June but, by late August, had generated enough uncertainty to throw the currency markets into turmoil. And he was not helped as much as he might have been by the Bundesbank, which - not having been consulted about the exchange rate fixed in 1990 - was neither convinced by it intellectually nor committed to it morally. He was not helped, either, by British industry, which failed lamentably to seize the opportunities offered by Germany's unification boom - with the result that Britain was less able than Holland or France to sustain the high interest rates imposed by the Bundesbank to choke the boom off. So a realignment within the ERM would have been an acceptable, if in some respects regrettable, response to what had become a very bleak economic position. Pulling out of the ERM was harder to reconcile with Mr Major's European reputation, but that reputation can still be retrieved if he confirms unambiguously that this is only a temporary measure, and above all if he commits himself clearly to getting Maastricht ratified by the British parliament as soon as possible. That may be what he thought he was doing in his speech in the Commons last Thursday. But outside the House the blast of the trumpet has come over as a weak and feeble sound. It seemed as if Mr Major was more concerned to delay or at best avoid the issue, by hedging both ERM re-entry and Maastricht ratification with conditions, than to summon his supporters for a decisive struggle. Meanwhile Mr Norman Lamont has continued banging his new-found nationalist drum. He has staked out a supposedly independent British monetary policy which, if it means anything, means that Britain will henceforth give a lower priority to the fight against inflation; and he has engaged in an unbelievably puerile war of words with the Bundesbank. Emulating the unjust steward in the gospel, Mr Lamont has been trying to save his career by making himself 'friends of the mammon of unrighteousness', among the fiercest critics of what was until a fortnight ago the be-all and end-all of his economic policy. By yesterday things had reached the point where, in order to placate these new-found friends, he was obliged to disclaim any intention of apologising for his intemperate anti-German remarks. Two weeks ago Mr Major was honourably unwilling to make Mr Lamont the scapegoat for the failure of a policy to which he himself was equally committed. That was rather quixotic even at the time - especially in view of his willingness to throw Mr David Mellor to the wolves for far more trivial reasons. But Mr Lamont's position has now become completely untenable. Given his constantly repeated anti-devaluation stance before September 16 he cannot credibly present himself as the architect of an entirely different policy. But equally his statements since then are incompatible with any attempt to retrieve even the shreds of the government's European policy and the prime minister's reputation. Mr Major's instinct is, it seems, to play for time, in the hope that he can avoid splitting his party by extracting new forms of words from his European colleagues. He may even hope that, if he waits long enough, Maastricht will collapse under its own weight. That instinct is wrong. Even if it enables him to remain prime minister (which is far from certain), it will be only - as Mr John Smith so felicitously put it - as the 'devalued prime minister of a devalued government' and indeed of a devalued country. Maastricht is not perfect. It may have to be augmented, reinterpreted or even revised. But Mr Major can only argue that case within the EC if it is absolutely clear that he is not trying to wriggle out of the commitment he gave last December. If he wants Britain ever again to be taken seriously in Europe he must make up his mind now, remind the world what he stands for, and insist that his party follow him or choose another leader.</p>

			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / No resigning, no devaluing, says Cavallo MR Domingo Cavallo, Argentina's economy minister, yesterday denied rumours that he would resign, run for president, or devalue the currency, after sealing a Dollars 31bn (Pounds 18bn) foreign debt restructuring agreement, John Barham writes from Buenos Aires. Mr Cavallo's success in reforming the economy has made him the most popular member of the government - more popular than President Carlos Menem. Mr Cavallo said he would run for governor of his home province of Cordoba in 1995.</p>

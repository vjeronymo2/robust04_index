Forty persons, including scholars and  officials from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Iran, and Turkey, as well  as Chinese scholars, officials, and entrepreneurs, attended the  meeting. To help the reader understand the relevant situation,  we now introduce below the gist of the speeches, made by Xu Dan,  deputy director of the China Contemporary International  Relations Institute; the important statements made by  (Kasianov), director, and (Aleinov), deputy director, of  Kazakhstan's Strategic Research Institute, which is directly  under the president; as well as the papers read out at the  meeting by Zhao Chunguang [6392 4783 0342] of Mongolia's  Northeast Asia Institute:  <H3>  I. China's Reform, Opening Up to the Outside World, Economic  Situation </H3>   China's reform and opening up to the outside world has been  going on for 15 years. It has caused fundamental changes in  China's socioeconomic features, and has caused us to find the  path of building socialism with China's characteristics. With  Deng Xiaoping's important speech while inspecting the south in  1992 as the starting point, in China's economic development and  its reform and opening lup to the outside world, there has  appeared a vigorous momentum with the following characteristics:    First, China's economy has entered a new long period of  high-speed growth. Last year's Gross National Product (GNP)  was 12.8 percent higher than that of the year before, and  industrial production grew 20.8 percent. It was the year with  the biggest growth since China's opening up to the outside  world. In agriculture, a bumper harvest was wrested--a 3.7  percent increase over that of the year before last. In the first  half of this year, the GNP grew 13.9 percent compared with that  of the same period last year, and the gross value of industrial  output grew 25.1 percent. In agriculture this year, summer grain  set a high-output record. This momentum of high-speed growth did  not happen by chance: It rests on the foundation of the results  obtained by the three-year economic readjustment began in 1989.  In this period there were bumper agricultural harvests in  successive years, there was a big improvement in the capacity  for supplying energy and raw materials, there were successive  years of a surplus in foreign trade, there was a big increase in  saving deposits, and successes were obtained in all economic  reforms. In addition, Comrade Deng Xiaoping's speech on his  southern tour at the right time and the holding of the 14th CPC  Congress gave China's economic development a looser and more  comfortable policy and environment.    Second, a major breakthrough was achieved in China's  economic reform. Last year's 14th CPC Congress proposed  that the goal of China's economic reform be to establish a  socialist economic system. This is a complex piece of social  systems engineering, and its main parts are: 1) Accelerate the  pace of economic reform and estalish a modernized enterprise  system, so that the enterprises truly establish a modernized  enterprise system, so that the pace of price reform and  establish a unified open, orderly competitive market system; 2)  accelerate the transformation of government functions and  establish a macro regulation and control system that meets the  demand of socialist markets; and 3) accelerate economic  legislation and establish a legal system that meets the needs of  the socialist market economy.    Third, China's opening up to the outside world has  entered a new historical stage. In the past it was mainly  the southeast coastal region that was opened up to the outside  world; now the opening up has expanded to riverine and border  cities and to interior provincial capitals and cities, forming a  new pattern in which from east to west, from south to north,  with provincial capitals as the center, the opening up to the  outside world radiates to surrounding areas in all directions.  In 1992 China's import and export trade totaled $165.6 billion,  a 22 percent increase over that of the year before. Foreign  businessmen invested $1.116 billion in China; 470,000 of the  three kinds of enterprises were approved for registration,  exceeding the total for the past dozen or so years. In the first  half of this year, China's import and export trade totaled  $77.81 billion, a 13.4 percent increase over that of the same  period last year. This shows that China's political stability,  social stability, and economic development filled with vitality  have made foreign investors better understand that China is an  ideal place for investment.    Currently, in China's economy, while there has been rapid  growth, there have also appeared some fairly prominent problems,  which are mainly manifested in: First, the scale of investment  in fixed assets is too large, and there are too many newly built  or rebuilt projects, causing a drop in macro investment results.  Second, the financial and banking situation is fairly grim, and  the contradiction between low financial income and high  financial outgo has added to the difficulty of an imbalance  between financial income and outgo. Third, the restraining  factor of "bottlenecks" is prominent, that is, there is an  overall strain on transport and communication, and the supply of  raw materials does not meet the demand. The shortage of funds  adversely affects the normal production and business activities  of many enterprises. Fourth, price rises are too high, and the  pressure of inflation has increased. The Chinese government's  policy for solving these problems is not, as in the pst, to  adopt overall retrenchment, but rather, is, through deepening  reform, changing mechanisms, optimizing structure, and improving  returns, to ensure and promote the sustained, rapid, and healthy  development of the national economy.  <H3>  II. The Situation After Central Asian Countries Became  Independent and the International Effect </H3>   The countries of Central Asia have been independent or more  than a year, and in most of them the situation is fairly stable;  based on our observations, the factors causing this stability  are many-sided. First, these countries have powerful leaders.  Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Turkmenistan have  swiftly put into practice the presidential system, and the  leaders enjoy fairly high prestige in their own countries;  constitutions have been formulated, and the "democratic system"  under the leadership of a president has been put on a legal  basis. Second, for economic reform a policy of steady progress  has been adopted, and "shock therapy" is not practiced. While  reforming, each country has put into practice a social security  system, thereby alleviating the difficulties in life encountered  by urban and rural residents in the course of reform, and  ensuring social stability. Third, each country has put in  practice a policy of nationality harmony; in formulating this  policy, the government, in the country's economic and political  life, takes into consideration the balancing of interests among  the nationalities and the maintaining of a harmonious  coexistence of the nationalities. Fourth, a religious policy  suited to the national condition has been put into practice. The  people of Central Asia have now obtained the freedom of  religious belief. Religions can be freely propagated in Central  Asian countries, but the government of each country clearly  stipulates that religious forces cannot participate in  governmental and political affairs, and cannot adversely affect  the political stability of the country. Because of the above  conditions, the situation in the past more than one year has  basically been one of stable development. However, the Central  Asian countries are in a transitional period in which there is a  turn in the situation, their economic difficulties are quite  serious, and politically there are many latent factors for  instability. Continued stability and development in the future  will depend on great efforts by the governments of these  countries.    After becoming independent, the Central Asian countries are  daily enhancing and expanding their international position and  influence, and Central Asia is becoming a region of interest and  action by the international community. This is also determined  by many factors: 1) Central Asia is located in that part of the  world that binds together the European and Asian continents; it  is the link between East and West, and its geographical position  is extremely important.  2) Central Asia is a "treasure house of natural resources"; here  there are abundant petroleum, natural gas, nonferrous metals,  and other mineral resources. Some countries abound in cotton,  and people call them "white gold countries." 3) Surrounding  Central Asia are some important countries with diferent social  systems and different ideologies and religious beliefs. The  Central Asian countries are building closer contacts and  developing relations of friendship with these countries, thereby  playing an important role in balancing the various forces. 4)  The economic level of Central Asia is that of the developing  countries, and it is an important force in the international  community for maintaining peace and promoting justice.  <H3>  III. Prospects for Cooperation Between China and Central  Asian Countries </H3>   Central Asia is a close neighbor of China's, and there are  three Central Asian countries that border China; they are linked  by common mountains and rivers, and the nationalities cross  borders. As early as before the year 2000 or so, there will be a  "Silk Road" that will directly link China and Central Asia. The  Chinese government has rapidly established formal diplomatic  relations with these countries, and has invited their leaders to  visit China; has established a basis on the five principles of  peaceful coexistence to develop relationships of equality and  mutual benefit, good neighborliness and friendship; and has  signed in many fields documents for carrying out contacts and  cooperation. In many aspects there is an identity of interests  between China and the Central Asian countries, and there could  be a further deepening of cooperation and a wider development of  relations.    A. In the political aspect, the identity of goals  between the Central Asian countries and China gives hope for  maintaining peaceful, stable internal and international  environments. This is because the Central Asian countries  now face many arduous tasks: politically, they must consolidte  independence; economically, they must overcome the serious  difficulties encountered after independence; internally, they  must give impetus to reform, open up to the outside world, and  ensure the tranquil life of all people in the country. All of  this must be done under conditions of international peace. China  is deepening its reform and expanding its opening up to the  outside world. Therefore, with China's and Central Asia's  security interests being identical, they can cooperate hand in  hand, both striving for the long-term security of their own  lands and working in common to create world peace and a rational  new order.    B. In the economic aspect, the complementary nature of  China and the Central Asian countries is very large, and the  potential for them in this respect is far from being  displayed. The superiority of the Central Asian countries  lies in their abundant natural resources, a certain industrial  base, and a gradually forming vast market. Their weak point is  that they have a one-product economy, and they must import from  abroad articles for use in industry and articles for daily use,  and must import foreign capital and technology to develop  processing industries and to exploit natural resources. At the  same time Central Asia is an inland region; it lacks seaports,  and its land communication depends on enhancement of its  cooperation with surrounding neighbor countries. Because it has  had more than 10 years of successful reform and opening up to  the outside world, China has established a diversified industry  with complete categories. It has a very strong capability in its  processing industries, and it can export large amounts of light  industry and textile, electronic, and daily-use products. Its  building, mining, agricultural and plantation technologies have  entered the world ranks, and it possesses the conditions for  wider economic cooperation. The economic and trade cooperation  between China and Central Asia is just beginning, and it may be  conjectured that there are vast prospects for its development.  China is accelerating its opening up to the outside world and  its construction of its western inland and border regions, with  the focus on developing the infrastructure for communication and  transportation. In the next three years China will invest 8  billion yuan in newly building or rebuilding the railroad  network in its northwest region. From now until the year 2000,  China will build some trunk lines of a high-grade national  highway that will crisscross the country east, west, south, and  north. This will be advantageous to China's internal unblocked  transportation, and will be even more convenient for enhancing  its cooperation with neighboring countries. China and Central  Asia also have more conditions to put into effect a joint  communication network, thereby causing the renewal of the Silk  Road to become a reality.    C. In international affairs, China and the Central  Asian countries have many common points. We belong to the  developing countries and our fundamental interests are  identical. The contacts, talks, and meetings of leaders of our  countries prove that, on many major international issues, the  Central Asian countries and China have identical views and  positions and have similar stands. The position and role of  Central Asian countries in international affairs are growing  daily, and the relations of cooperation in foreign affairs  between China and the Central Asian countries are becoming  closer and closer. In the new structure of the pluralistic  world, China and the Central Asian countries both qualify to  become active participants in establishing a just and rational  new international order.    In brief, China and the Central Asian countries in political  affairs should become models of countries with different social  systems coexisting in peace for long periods of time and being  good neighbors and friends; in culture, science and technology  should become friends who learn from each other and who advance  together; and in international affairs should become positive  forces for maintaining peace and stability and for extablishing  a just, rational new world order.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The finance Minister, Derek Keys, says South Africa  is not interested in an economy which grows at normal rates, as  this will make no impact on the huge number of unemployed.  Opening the new Johannesburg Press Club venue in Johannesburg,  he said he believed that a growth rate of above 6 percent and  not artificial factors such as a rise in the gold price or  commodity prices was needed to revive the economy. Mr. Keys  said 6 percent was critical and that everything had to be done  to try to achieve such a growth rate.</p>

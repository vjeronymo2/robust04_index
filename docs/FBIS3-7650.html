			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [By researcher Yu Yong-ku] </F>   [Text] North Korea still seems to have no intention  of holding a North-South Summit Meeting. It characterizes the  Kim Yong-sam administration as a "slavish, pro-American regime  no different than the succession of military regimes [preceding  it]" and is concentrating its efforts on North Korean-U.S.  negotiations. We take a look at the North Korean [NK]  unification policy and foreign policy for the new year.    It is uncertain just when it began, but we have come to ask  the question every New Year: "Will a North-South summit meeting  materialize this year?" The mood neglects questions of what a  summit meeting would be for, what it would deal with, and what  role it would play in the realization of unification; rather,  interest centers merely on whether it will be held. Recent  discussion is no exception. Under the hasty expectation that  with the seeming improvement in NK-U.S. nuclear negotiations the  North-South dialogue too would begin to improve, vague  observations are being made on the possibility that a summit  meeting would be held within the year.    Summit-related questions were asked at President Kim  Yong-sam's New Year's news conference on January 6th, it too  being no exception. "We must not have a summit meeting just to  have a summit meeting. What is more, there is no reason we  cannot hold talks with President Kim Il-song. For this, however,  a few problems about which we are talking must be solved,"  answered President Kim. This answer was prepared in advance and  can be viewed as the administration's official position. In  short, this means that, for a summit meeting, preconditions,  such as North-South mutual nuclear inspections to guarantee  nuclear transparency, must first be met.    "This is not the stage for saying anything concrete, but NK  has started to change," said President Kim in a news conference  late last year, "It is believed that next year will be an  important turning point in North-South relations." The nuance of  the president's statement given on January 6th was entirely  different from this optimism. It gives the feeling that he is  putting more importance on the fulfillment of preconditions.  Last year's optimistic statement is seemingly related to what  NK's Kim Il-song revealed on December 25th in his meeting with  UN Secretary-General Boutros-Ghali: "We are willing to pursue a  North-South exchange of special envoys."    The situation changed this year, however. A statement given  in a news conference by deputy prime minister and unification  minister Yi Yong-tok, the day before the president's New Year's  news conference, needs to be carefully examined. Saying, "The  time has come to talk about NK's human-rights problem," he  goaded NK's Achilles heel. It is difficult to view this as just  a statement made in passing. It gives the impression that they  are aiming for something. "A meeting itself must not be the goal  of the North-South relationship. It is important to develop it  into a substantial relationship," said Deputy Prime Minister Yi,  adding, "Even if NK should propose talks, it is our plan to  reject this unconditionally if it doesn't fit the principles of  the administration." Anyone can read this emphasis on  "principle" as a "hard-line posture toward the North." It can be  viewed as a response to the "hard-line statement toward the  South" given by Kim Il-song in his New Year's address. The  nuance of the statement by Yi is different from the original  mood of government authorities, who had been optimistic that if  a NK-U.S. agreement were concluded, North-South working-level  talks for an exchange of special envoys would be held.    O this issue, NK, in a report by the secretariat of the  Committee For the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland  [CPRF] given on January 7th, criticized Deputy Prime Minister Yi  as "the one who desecrated the rights of our young students,"  pointing to the fact that when visiting Pyongyang as the chief  representative of the South Korean [SK] delegation to the 1985  9th North-South Red Cross Talks, Yi had been watching group  gymnastics by a team of youth, but left in the middle of the  event. "In the future, people like Deputy Prime Minister Yi  won't be able to step even one foot into the area of our  republic," the report said, showing a hard-line stance. The CPRF  also added a warning that if another statement is made like that  of Deputy Prime Minister Yi, "The North-South relationship may  be confronted by a situation difficult to get under control."    However, authorities at our Foreign Ministry, carefully  watching the developments of NK-U.S. contact, predict that if in  early January progress is made on nuclear inspections between NK  and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), their is a  high probability that a North-South working-level contact will  be held around the end of January. They also foresaw the  possibility that even the time for a North-South exchange of  special envoys would be decided at the NK-U.S. talks. This is  reading the mood optimistically. Considering the mutually  contradictory stances taken by the [SK] authorities, it is  unclear whether their basic position is one of actively pursuing  talks (including a conciliatory posture toward the North) or  whether it is one which stresses principle and takes a passive  approach to talks.    Although it may seem somewhat hasty, let us consider the  prospects for a North-South summit meeting within the year. To  put our conclusion first, "A summit within the year is  impossible because of many problems and because of the divergent  positions of the North and South."    Why is this so? We will first examine the reasons for this,  then take an overall look at NK's policies toward the South, the  U.S. and Japan this year.    In connection with the observation that if the IAEA  inspection team is allowed to visit NK, working-level contact  for a North-South exchange of special envoys will begin, first,  it is questionable that at the present stage NK will actually  consent to working-level talks. Of course, our government  authorities can be positive about working-level contacts. For  NK, however, if there is a little progress in solving the  nuclear issue through NK-U.S. negotiations, its incentive for  responding to working-level contact weakens. It is clear that  even if it is firmly decided that SK-U.S. Team Spirit exercises  will be discontinued, NK will not think conditions have been met  for North-South working-level contacts. It will again demand of  SK that it give up dependence on foreign powers under the name  of "abandoning the system of international cooperation," an  expression of the intent to withdraw U.S. troops, to permanently  discontinue joint military exercises with foreign military  units, etc.    Even if NK agrees to working-level contacts because of the  strong U.S. demand for it, there is a high probability that it  will only be a formality, even more so than the working-level  contact last October. This is because it appears NK will not  back away from its basic position concerning the duties of the  special envoys. Compared to our position that the nuclear  problem should be solved first and other outstanding issues  discussed, NK will want to deal in parallel with the performance  of denuclearization and the relaxation of tensions (leading into  a demand for arms reduction), planning to promote national  solidarity (leading into a demand for a federation-type  unification), and a North-South summit meeting. The disputed  points of the special-envoy-exchange agenda are unlikely to be  easily resolved and the exchange itself is unlikely to be  realized.    Thus, there are limits to the optimistic view that things  will work out in the order of a NK-IAEA agreement, a third round  of NK-U.S. talks, a North-South special-envoy exchange (or with  a North-South special-envoy exchange coming before a third round  of NK-U.S. talks).    Although there is little possibility it will happen, if  within the year all conditions are met and there is an exchange  of special envoys and a summit meeting, NK's President Kim  Il-song will use the summit meeting to call for the immediate  realization of "a federal system based on the idea of one  people, one nation, two systems and two governments, national  solidarity (the issue of economic cooperation will also be  mentioned in this framework), and peaceful arms reduction from  the principle of autonomy. A summit meeting is unlikely, but if  it does come about, NK will next seek contact talks with figures  from each sector of SK from a "national-solidarity" standpoint  Seen in this way, NK's thinking is completely different from  that of our government, which has no intention of backing away  from its aim of "window unification" for the North-South  dialogue.    Also, it is the thinking of our government to respond  positively to calls for North-South economic cooperation if NK  "nuclear transparency" is guaranteed, but it is difficult to  hope for the kind of "complete resolution of the nuclear  question" wanted by our government. In its negotiations with NK,  even the U.S. is pouring all its efforts into binding NK, no  matter what, to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and  at least getting an IAEA nuclear inspection. For the present,  the special inspection of two unreported facilities (NK insists  they are "military facilities") for which SK, the U.S. and the  IAEA had originally intended to push hard, seems to be out of  reach. Prospects are that the more this issue is brought up, the  more the rounds of fighting surrounding the NK nuclear question  will be repeated. Given this situation, the Kim Yong-sam  administration is unlikely to hurry a North-South summit meeting  and it appears that the road toward a summit meeting will feel  that much more distant.    Moreover, suggesting that he has no intention of carrying on  a dialogue with the Kim Yong-sam government, President Kim  Il-song's New Year's address further dims prospects for a summit.    "We hoped the SK authorities would respond to our  National-Solidarity 10-Point Program and walk the road of  reconciliation and cooperation, and we also took important  measures concerning the exchange of special envoys to take place  between the highest levels of the two sides. The SK authorities,  however, ignoring our generous offers and the cherished desire  for unification of the whole Korean people, is walking the road  not of national autonomy, but of dependence of foreign powers,  not of national unity, but of North-South confrontation," said  [NK's] President Kim last year, strongly criticizing the Kim  Yong-sam administration's posture toward the North. "Joining  with foreign powers, the SK authorities frequently carry out  large-scale military exercises opposing our republic and, using  our nuclear problem as an excuse, talks of military  confrontation and a system of international cooperation, driving  the North-South relationship into a perilous situation," he  added.    These statements attract attention because they show that NK  understands our government to be a "pro-American flunkyist  regime" and that as long as there is no change in this posture,  it has no intention of taking part in an inter-Korean dialogue.  This is a 180-degree change from the "sense of expectation"  shown by NK Prime Minister Kang Song-san last year after the  birth of the Kim Yong-sam administration, when President Kim  stated, "The interests of the Korean people come before allies."    This year's New Year's address was exceptional in that  [NK's]  President Kim did not include a proposal aimed at our  government. In last year's New Year's address, even while  criticizing our government for its "antinational behavior,"  because it obstructed the implementation of the North-South  Basic Agreement and reopened Team Spirit exercises, as if having  the newly born Kim Yong-sam administration in mind, he stated,  "No matter who they may be, if someone comes out with a sincere  attitude, genuinely wanting to solve the problems of the  unification of the Fatherland, we will sit down with them  face-to-face and frankly discuss the problems of the unification  of the Korean people, without bringing up the past, and endeavor  together to achieve the great work of the unification of the  Fatherland." One can feel the extreme distance between the two  addresses. We are reminded again that the adoption of the  "National-Solidarity 10-Point Program" in the 5th Session of the  9th Supreme People's Assembly held in April and the proposal  immediately following it in May for an exchange of special  envoys to prepare for a North-South summit meeting were possible  because statements of this tone were in last year's New Year's  address.    This year, not only did Kim fail to make any proposals  toward  our government, but he did not hesitate to make statements which  seem to indicate that he has given up his "original sense of  expectation" in the Kim Yong-sam administration. "The so-called  civilian government of SK is only a facade: in actuality it is  no different from the succession of military dictatorships  [which preceded it]. Anticommunist, fascist, evil laws remain  intact in SK and the earnest desire of the SK people for the  unification of an autonomous, democratic Fatherland is not being  realized," criticized [NK's] President Kim. He also stated, "It  is right that the SK people and figures from each sector should  feel that there is no longer anything to watch and hope for from  the present SK regime." Attention has focused on such statements  because they reveal NK's overall perception of the Kim Yong-sam  administration.    In short, they contain an underlying "subversiveness" which  says, "You must struggle without attachment to the civilian  government," clearly showing a "lack of intention to talk" with  the other party in the dialogue.    If we are to understand why NK has taken a hard-line posture  this year, we must go back a little in time.    Originally, NK focused its attention on NK-Japanese  negotiations on normalization with the goal of importing  Japanese capital and technology and on building a system of  coexistence with SK through a federation-type unification and  economic cooperation. To accomplish this, it accepted IAEA  nuclear inspections and adopted the North-South Basic Agreement  and Joint Declaration on Denuclearization. However, NK's plans  were not realized because of the U.S.'s hard-line position  concerning the nuclear issue. U.S. pressure grew and it became  clear that the U.S. was strongly influencing Japan and SK. As a  result, Japan, keeping in step with the U.S., made it clear that  there would be no progress in normalization negotiations as long  as the NK nuclear issue was unresolved. Ignoring the NK position  of strongly demanding, as an indication of our intention to  implement the Basic Agreement, "the abandonment of the system of  international cooperation" and "the discontinuance of various  war exercises," our government responded by strengthening  cooperation with the U.S. and other allies and using Team Spirit  exercises as a means for pressuring NK to resolve the nuclear  issue.    In this process, NK appears to have understood that its  normalization negotiations with the Japanese Government were not  going smoothly and that, on top of this, the Kim Yong-sam  administration's posture toward the North was not that  transitional compared with past governments and was  "nonautonomous" to the extent that it considered international  pressure on NK important, and that its gradual trend toward  conservatism was becoming stronger.    Thus, NK put off NK-Japanese normalization negotiations and  the North-South dialogue. Rather, by playing its nuclear card,  it attempted to find a breakthrough in the direction of direct  negotiations with the U.S. This was the mood last year. Now, the  situation has changed. NK's nuclear card has won a certain  measure of success. As the battle surrounding the NK nuclear  issue continues, the scene has taken on a new composition: the  North-South dialogue has moved to the back and direct NK-U.S.  negotiations have begun in earnest. These are the main factors  preventing NK from being active in its dialogue with the Kim  Yong-sam administration.    NK appears to have concluded that, in view of the  conservative current of the Kim Yong-sam administration as is  seen in the continued existence of the National Security Law and  the resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Han Wan-song, it has  nothing to gain through the inter-Korean dialogue. Another  aspect of this appears to be that NK seems to have been  encouraged by reports that activists in SK are again gaining  vigor over the opening of the SK rice market and that there is  movement to organize a new unification movement. It is because  of this that statements have been frequently flowing out of NK  reports that the struggle against opening the SK rice market  must be sublimated into an "autonomy, democracy, and unification  movement."    Considering the fact that existing policy, that "the  inter-Korean exchange of special envoys must be realized before  the third round of NK-U.S. talks," was confirmed by a decision  reached in government unification-related, high-level strategy  meetings, the U.S. choice now remains important. This is because  it appears that NK clearly has no intention of exchanging envoys.    [NK] President Kim's New Year's address confirms this.  "Pressure and threats do not work with us. Not only is it  impossible to solve the problem depending on such methods, but  they could push the situation into a catastrophe," he said. "The  U.S. must look at all the facts correctly and act prudently."  Even while taking this hard-line stance, he stated that the  nuclear issue could be resolved "if, on condition of a joint  declaration between NK and the U.S., both sides keep and perform  the principles already agreed upon." This can be viewed as an  expression of his intention to continue to resolve the issue  through dialogue. A result of the first round of NK-U.S. talks  last June, the "joint declaration" mentioned here contains:  suspension of threats and the use of force, including nuclear  weapons; respect for each other's sovereignty and  noninterference in internal politics; and support for a peaceful  unification of the Korean peninsula. For NK, this result in  considerable concessions by the U.S. was gained by playing its  nuclear card. Thus, NK has evaluated this joint declaration as  having "put an end to the hostile relationship between NK and  the U.S. and prepared a common foundation capable of  fundamentally resolving the nuclear issue."    At this stage, an important clue for anticipating future  progress is the content of a news conference with the Korean  Central News Agency given by a NK foreign ministry spokesperson  the day after the 18th contact (on December 29th), which took  place after July's second round of talks in Geneva. "In this  contact, the U.S. side formally expressed its intention to  suspend Team Spirit joint military exercises as a part of its  measures to eliminate the nuclear threat toward us. As befits  our special status of having temporarily suspended the  validation of our withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation  Treaty [NPT], we decided to permit inspections needed to  guarantee the continuity of compliance, not regular or irregular  inspections legally required in accordance with the treaty on  nuclear facilities, which we have already reported," he  revealed. Thus, the U.S. ultimately promised to suspend Team  Spirit exercises without being able to make NK return to the  situation as it was before it announced it would withdraw from  the NPT. This means that the SK-U.S. plan to use Team Spirit  exercises as a means for pressuring NK ended in failure.    "Based on this progress, we have decided to conclude a  package settlement of the issues in the third round of talks, to  fundamentally solve the nuclear issue by ending the U.S.'s  nuclear threat and hostile policy toward us, by improving  NK-U.S. relations, and by resuming regular and irregular IAEA  inspections of our nuclear facilities," the Foreign Ministry  spokesperson confirmed. This means that the U.S. is accepting  the "package settlement" upon which NK has stubbornly insisted.    If this package settlement is achieved in the third round of  talks, there is a high probability that the IAEA special  inspections and the North-South mutual inspections (and an  exchange of special envoys in preparation for this),  persistently sought by the U.S., will be put off. Now the U.S.  is left with a serious choice. As a story which was leaked out  in early January, it is unknown whether there was an agreement  between NK and the U.S. on "reopening the North-South dialogue."  Officially, the NK position is, "The North-South dialogue is an  issue internal to the Korean people. Therefore, it is not  something for the U.S. to interfere in." The U.S. State  Department insists that NK expressed its intention to "reopen  the North-South dialogue." Even while impatient to gain, if  nothing else, at least IAEA inspections of NK, in order to  maintain the NPT system, the U.S. seems to be trying hard not to  give this impression to the SK side.    On the one hand, there is a possibility that, following the  current of improvement in NK-U.S. relations, NK-Japanese  relations will escape from last year's stagnation and make  progress at considerable speed. Reports have already come out  that the Japanese Government is secretly pursuing a resumption  of talks on normalizing relations with NK. If NK and the U.S.  successfully conclude a "package settlement," prospects for  NK-Japanese normalization will become that much brighter. Also,  even if a "package settlement" is delayed, the mood of  negotiations on normalization will change considerably. However,  although normalized relations with the U.S. are remote, it is  still unknown whether normalized relations with Japan will be  achieved this year. This is because negotiations will proceed  even in a state in which the NK "nuclear question" has not  completely disappeared. In connection with this, it is being  reported by some that our government is taking pains to come up  with countermeasures out of concern that a normalization of NK  relations with the U.S. and Japan might suddenly be achieved.  What is more, although difficult to believe, it has even been  reported that the government is planning to help NK normalize  relations with the U.S. and Japan. Regardless, it appears that  the shock of NK normalization with the U.S. and Japan will bring  a change of perception greater than when SK normalized relations  with China and the Soviet Union and that its effects will be  considerable.    On the other hand, the U.S. continues to demand a "complete  resolution of the NK nuclear question," special inspections by  the IAEA and North-South mutual inspections. NK continues to  reject this and there is a good possibility it may end up  withdrawing its suspension of the validity of its withdrawal  from the NPT. If this happens, the NK nuclear issue will  ultimately be set before the UN Security Council. In such an  event, NK would withdraw from the UN "without hesitating."  Although it is questionable whether a decision will be made in  the UN to take even economic sanctions, in the unlikely event  that this does happen, military tensions on the Korean peninsula  will rapidly increase. Thus, it appears that it will be  difficult for the U.S. to continue with its existing position,  calling for a "complete resolution of the NK nuclear question."    However, if the U.S. demands no more than normal inspections  (giving up on special inspections of two locations), it will  mean relinquishing a complete resolution of the NK nuclear  question. This would damage the authority of the IAEA and the UN  and would give rise to the insecurity of the NPT system. Here is  the dilemma of the U.S. There is a strong possibility that after  first achieving full-scale implementation of normal inspections,  the U.S. will try to see through long-term, staged demands to  secure nuclear transparency. This process will be an extension  of NK-U.S. talks.    However, even though the nuclear question remains, if the  international mood goes in the direction of believing that the  NK nuclear issue has been settled, Japan will consider  normalization with NK, although it may take some time. In  connection with this, the December appointment of party  secretary Hwang Chang-yop as chairman of the Supreme People's  Assembly's Foreign Relations Committee suggests much. It is  anticipated that in the future he will play an important role in  foreign relations with Japan, the U.S. and other Western nations.    This year, NK is negative toward the inter-Korean dialogue,  but it is predicted that it will show comparatively great  interest in the expansion of the National Unification Front.  This is clearly seen in the New Year's address also.    Setting out as a fundamental principle a federation-style  unification based on his National-Solidarity 10-Point Program  and the idea of one people, one nation, two systems, two  governments, [NK] President Kim urged, "By banding together as  one under the standard of national solidarity and carrying out a  nationwide struggle, this year all Korean people in the North,  South and overseas, must open a new phase of the unification of  the Fatherland." This is an expression of his intention to  concentrate all his powers on expanding the National Unification  Front.    This is not a National Unification Front aimed solely at  activists in SK or overseas. It means that he is going to  promote cooperation with various civilian figures, including  those in business and religion, and responsible leaders of  political parties and social organizations. This unification  policy, referred to as the expansion of the National Unification  Front, is first of all focused on isolating the Kim Yong-sam  administration. The next stage comes out of an intention to give  the Kim Yong-sam administration no choice, through the use of  internal and external pressure, but to adopt a "transitional  posture toward the North." The core of his unification line is  contained in the 10-Point Program, which came out last April,  and it appears that in the future no NK unification policy will  depart from this framework. The 10-Point Program is an extension  of 1973's Fatherland Unification 5-Point Program, 1980's  Federation 10-Point Revised Plan, and 1990's Fatherland  Unification 5-Point Plan. Even so, it can be said to be a new  action directive, newly prepared in consideration of the new  international environment.    The 10-Point Program supposes a "unified nation which is  autonomous, peaceful, and neutral" (Item 1). This unified nation  would leave intact the existing two systems and two governments.  It would be a federal state in which the regional governments  would participate equally. The ideological foundation of  national solidarity is love for the Korean people and a spirit  of national autonomy (Item 2). Its fundamental principle is to  make everything subordinate to the promotion of coexistence,  coprosperity, and the public interest, and to the great work of  unification (Item 3).    Presented as actual, immediate tasks are: suspension of all  political strife, which promotes division and confrontation  (Item 4); elimination of apprehensions about invasion from the  North and South, about victory over communism or communization  (Item 5); regard for the importance of democracy and  acknowledgment of differences in ideology and doctrine (Item 6);  protection of material and mental wealth owned by individuals  and organizations (Item 7); and understanding and trust through  contact, exchange and dialogue. Besides these, it adds that the  subject of national solidarity is the whole Korean people in the  North, South, and overseas (Item 9) and that people who have  contributed to national solidarity and unification need to be  valued highly (Item 10).    Here, items three, seven, and ten are interesting in that  they also aim for economic cooperation with SK businessmen. In  light of the 10-Point Program, even if NK does not consider  inter-Korean talks important this year, it will continue to be  interested in North-South economic exchange through a third  country, which is in the middle of active development, and in  direct exchange. In this process, discord may appear between our  government, which wants overall control of economic cooperation  with the North in keeping with its principle of "window  unification," and business.    NK's interest in the National Unification Front was also  confirmed in the All-Korea Alliance [Pomminnyon] Platform (seven  items) and Regulations (Chapter 5 Article 23), published  December 16th of last year in a news conference by Paek In-chun,  chairman of the All-Korea Alliance's northern headquarters. The  platform is an overall reorganization of what had been argued in  the resolutions of the All-Korea Conference [Pomminjok Taehoe]  and the Council of Joint Chairmen.    Overall, the inter-Korean dialogue has come to a standstill  this year. As the movement of surrounding nations centered on NK  speeds up, it is possible that discord within SK will grow over  evaluations of the NK attitude and responses to it. There could  even be subtle dissonance exposed between SK and the U.S.,  depending on the situation. This may even become the year that  the "breaking of the system of international cooperation,"  persistently pursued by NK, is successful. If the situation  develops in this way, the government may have no choice but to  relax its hard-line posture toward the North. NK's hard-line  posture toward the South can be viewed as having had this as its  aim. NK's brushing aside our government to depend tenaciously on  direct negotiations with the U.S. is a result of its conclusion  that the North-South dialogue has no meaning under conditions in  which the Basic Agreement is not being kept. Also, behind NK's  concentration of its efforts on expanding the National  Unification Front is its intention to isolate the Kim Yong-sam  administration.    If the government is to take a leading role in the  resumption  of the North-South dialogue, then it seems that it would be good  for it to actively enter into arms-reduction negotiations, for  the "construction of a peaceful system" capable of being a  fundamental solution to the nuclear problem. This is because  arms-reduction negotiations are desired by NK as well. At the  same time, North-South economic cooperation could be implemented  in parallel. Otherwise, we could be dragged around by the  situation produced by NK, which is simultaneously taking a  hard-line posture toward SK and a relaxed posture toward the  U.S. A "nationally autonomous," transitional attitude is a  prerequisite if the government is to actively enter  arms-reduction negotiations. For the present, this appears to be  a very difficult choice.</p>

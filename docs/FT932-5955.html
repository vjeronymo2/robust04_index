			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Boots fights City sentiment with numbers: Neil Buckley, Guy de Jonquieres and Paul Abrahams examine a mystery illness BOOTS, once seen as one of the safest stocks on the market, is searching for a remedy for its ailing share price. Since January, its shares have been among the weakest in the FTSE-100, underperforming the market by almost 25 per cent. The cure may be elusive, as on the surface the patient seems as healthy, under Sir James Blyth its chief executive since 1987, as ever. The chemists, retailing and pharmaceuticals group is expected to report on Thursday a 14 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 359.5m to Pounds 410m in the year to March. However, that may not be enough to dispel City nerves. 'It is very much a battle between the actual numbers and market sentiment,' said Mr John Richards, stores analyst at NatWest Securities. The problem is that much of the profits rise will come from Boots The Chemists, the best-performing division in the group and provider of almost 60 per cent of its operating profits. The City is worried that future profit growth at BTC may be limited. Boots' prices have come under fire recently. First, Superdrug, the discount chain owned by Kingfisher, launched sharp discounts on fragrances, sun-care products and condoms. Then last week, the Mergers and Monopolies Commission was highly critical of Boots pricing on contact lens solutions. Unless Boots can strike some counterblows in the public relations battle, sales and margins could be under threat. BTC is the UK's eighth-biggest retailer, with sales of Pounds 2.47bn last year. Profits have increased almost threefold from Pounds 101m in 1988 to a forecast Pounds 285m in the year to March. Much of the improvement has come from a doubling of margins in the same period to almost 10 per cent. That has been achieved thanks to increased sales of high-margin products such as food and own-label goods; a weeding out of less profitable lines; and the introduction of sophisticated technology. But anecdotal evidence, supported by last week's MMC report on contact lens solutions, also suggests Boots uses its buying power mercilessly to screw rock-bottom prices out of its suppliers. Yet critics say its selling prices are only competitive because its dominance enables it to set the levels in an otherwise fragmented market, and that it does not pass its efficiency savings on to the consumer. Whatever the reality behind Superdrug's claims to be cheaper, its successful public relations campaign has reinforced customers' impressions that BTC's prices are too high - as Boots' own research has shown. Price cuts initiated by Superdrug are often followed by the big superstore operators such as Sainsbury and Tesco, which have started to compete with Boots on its traditional home territory - over-the-counter medicines and personal care products. Boots seems to have acknowledged the threat by agreeing to set up small outlets within Sainsbury stores from this July on a trial basis. Any pressure on BTC's profits could have serious implications, as the performance of the rest of the group is less than inspiring - especially those divisions acquired in the Pounds 900m takeover of Ward White in 1989. The retail division is forecast to cut overall losses from Pounds 5.3m to about Pounds 3.5m, but still contains two problem cases. Do It All, the DIY joint venture formed in 1990 when Boot's Payless chain merged with WH Smith's Do It All, is forecast to drop from a small profit last year to a loss of Pounds 12m-Pounds 14m. The venture has found it difficult to be number three in the market (after B&amp;Q and Texas Homecare), saddled with some old stores in poor locations. Moreover, it started up just as the housing market slumped, and a series of price-cutting wars between DIY retailers saw margins collapse. Both Boots and WH Smith say they are committed to turning Do It All around, by developing its brand identity and offering better service and information to customers. But some critics still say they would do better closing the business. Children's World, the edge-of-town childrenswear and toy chain, is expected to cut losses from Pounds 6.4m to Pounds 4m-Pounds 6m, but after five years is not close to profit. 'One of the few ways Boots could redeem its reputation is to get the axe out, and Children's World would be a prime candidate,' suggested one analyst. Other retailing businesses are not doing so badly. Halfords, its car parts and bicycle retail chain, is expected to show its first full-year profit of about Pounds 3m, from a Pounds 10.5m loss last year. It is reaping the benefits from a shake-up of its accounting system and management, the application of Boots retailing skills and systems, and a revamp of its car service centres. Boots Opticians is another bright spot, with trading profits likely to rise to Pounds 6.5m from Pounds 5.5m. The outlook is similarly mixed for the other main weapon in Boots's armoury, its pharmaceuticals division, which is expected to show a fall in trading profits from Pounds 120.8m to Pounds 110m. Boots is a minnow in the rapidly-consolidating drugs industry and there are doubts whether the division is large enough to discover and then develop innovative compounds on the global basis necessary to ensure a reasonable return on R&amp;D investment. High hopes were pinned on last year's launch of Manoplax, a treatment for congestive heart failure, nicknamed Mananaplax by the City because of the time it took to bring to market. But a study released earlier this year suggested that at certain doses patients suffered higher mortality rates than on placebo. This means that even if Manoplax is tolerated at lower doses, the company will have big difficulties convincing specialists of its utility. Lehman Brothers, the US brokers, downgraded projected sales for 1995 from Dollars 100m (Pounds 64.9m) to Dollars 75m. They had previously expected sales to reach Dollars 250m towards the end of the decade. Some analysts speculate Manoplax could be withdrawn. 'Fundamentally, Boots is still a strong business,' concluded one analyst last week. 'The trouble is there's lots of meat for the bears to chew on.'</p>

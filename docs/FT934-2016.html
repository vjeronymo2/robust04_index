			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / The GATT Deal: Balladur wins final round -France As President Bill Clinton tries to push the Gatt accord through Congress, he might well envy the tactics of Mr Edouard Balladur, France's prime minister, who yesterday wrapped the controversial deal up with quite unrelated promises of future tax cuts and aid to women and the aged. Using the pecularities of French parliamentary procedure, Mr Balladur yesterday ensured overwhelming support for the Gatt deal by tabling a vote of confidence not only on the trade agreements but also in his government's overall past performance and future pledges. Nonetheless, he devoted most of his hour-long speech to the Gatt deal, which he said was in the long-term interest of France, the world's fourth largest exporter. It would not bring 'miraculous gains', but in opening markets 'in agriculture, industry and services, it respects the fundamental interests of France'. Specifically, he claimed that France had won: Tariff concessions for its exports, particularly in steel, chemicals, pharmaceuticals and perfumes. Protection of its copyrights in textiles, foodstuffs, luxury and pharmaceutical goods. Gains for its banks and insurance companies to expand abroad in the service area, which accounts for 60 per cent of French exports. Some protection for vulnerable sectors like aluminium and consumer electronics. The ability to go on funding aircraft-making. On the two most controversial areas for France - audiovisual broadcasting and agriculture - he claimed success for his own personal intervention with President Clinton, warning him last Sunday night that 'France would sign no agreement that jeopardised its cultural identity'.</p>

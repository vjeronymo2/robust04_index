			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Pump device plugs leaks To guard against leakages of toxic or flammable materials, David Brown Pumps has introduced a device which can be attached to a standard double seal assembly on any pump. It eliminates leaks of liquids or gases during the pump's operation and shuts down in the event of failure. The unit is designed to operate under any pressure (however wildly fluctuating), with any fluid (however dirty), and at any temperature (however extreme). It uses a piston, moving vertically in a cylinder, to separate a clean barrier fluid above from the hazardous fluid transported below. It needs no electrical power, air or coolant supply.

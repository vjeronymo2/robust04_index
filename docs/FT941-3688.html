			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Broking strength lifts MAI to Pounds 48m MAI, the financial services and broadcasting group yesterday announced a 42 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profit to Pounds 48m mainly because of the strength of its wholesale broking business. Turnover increased by 57 per cent to Pounds 321m and earnings per share rose by 38 per cent to 9p a share in the six months to December 31. The interim dividend stays at 2p. Sir James McKinnon, chairman, said trading in the second six months continued to be good with high levels of activity in the financial markets and an improving trend in car sales, market research and television advertising. The most significant development was the purchase of Anglia Television which marked a change in the centre of gravity of the company towards media and television in particular. In February the group also increased its stake in Satellite Information Services, the company broadcasting live racing to betting shops to 17.5 per cent and sold its holding in Havas, the French media group for Pounds 45m. Lord Hollick, chief executive expected 40 per cent of MAI's business to come from the media within the next few years although financial services will remain the core. MAI's first big move into television - winning the ITV licence for the south of England with Meridian Broadcasting - performed better than target and made a small profit in its first year despite a difficult advertising market. In the six months to December Meridian had a turnover of Pounds 90m and profits of Pounds 5.6m. Lord Hollick dismissed as 'much ado about nothing' reports that minority holders in Meridian, Carlton Communications and SelecTV, fear they will not get the full benefit of the Anglia deal. Some in the industry believe the relationship between Carlton and MAI may have become more edgy because of advertising sales issues. See Lex</p>

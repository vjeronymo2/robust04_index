"The GATT as it stands right now seems to have a  trade-at-all- costs attitude," Greenpeace said while the WWF  attacked the proposed Multilateral Trade Organisation (MTO) that  will administer the GATT agreement.    "The MTO will have the power to override national laws on  environmental protection, health and safety," WWF director  Gordon Shepherd said.    "Uruguay Round drafts show that trade negotiators have  failed  even to establish a trade and environment committee within the  proposed MTO," he said.    Charles Arden-Clarke of Greenpeace said that by ignoring the  environment the credibility of the MTO had been damaged before  its inception "at a time when the environment and sustainable  development are at the top of the international political  agenda."    Representatives from 115 nations are meeting here in an  attempt to end the Uruguay Round of talks under the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.</p>

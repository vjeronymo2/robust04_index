			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Biotechnology sell-off hits OTC market Wall Street BIG BOARD equity prices posted strong gains yesterday afternoon, but the advance masked a drop in the healthcare sector, while a sell-off in biotechnology stocks depressed the over-the-counter market, writes Karen Zagor in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 20.81 higher at 3,342.99. The more broadly based Stan dard&amp;Poor's 500 was up 1.03 at 435.25, while the Amex composite was down 3.09 at 399.29, and the Nasdaq composite tumbled 11.19 to 652.42. Trading volume was heavy on the NYSE with more than 320m shares changing hands. Rises narrowly outnumbered declines by 1,048 to 938. On Friday, the Dow firmed 19.99 to close at 3,322.18 after a week which had seen wild fluctuations following President Bill Clinton's first budget plan. Healthcare issues took a battering on the NYSE, as well as in Nasdaq trading. A number of drug com pany stocks hit 52-week lows yesterday in active trading including Bristol-Myers Squibb, which fell Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 53 7/8 , Johnson &amp; Johnson dropped Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 39 and Pfizer fell Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 54.

Philip Morris tumbled Dollars 3-1/2 to Dollars 64-1/2, a 52-week low, in hectic trading. The price erosion follows concern about higher excise taxes on cigarettes. JC Penney rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 74 7/8 after an analyst at Bear Stearns upgraded his rating on the stock to 'buy' from 'hold'.

The stock plunged Dollars 28 5/8 to Dollars 13 1/2 , significantly below its previous 52-week low of Dollars 31 3/4 . The Synergen sell-off drove other Nasdaq biotech issues lower in very heavy trading, with Amgen dropping Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 41 1/2 , a 52-week low, Chiron falling Dollars 5 1/8 to Dollars 45 5/8 and US Healthcare losing Dollars 4 to Dollars 39 1/2 .

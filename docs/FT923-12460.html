			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Waking up a moribund boardroom - Diary of a Private Investor / Private companies need watching ONCE, there was a small, sleepy, private company with ten shareholders, most of whom appeared to have inherited their holdings. The company owned a well-known product in a growing market, but it seemed that it had failed to develop it to ensure a profitable future. The company's profits were poor. No single shareholder had voting control so I decided to see if I could buy control. I would then inject further funds - and ideas - into the company, and, transform it, I hoped. I instructed solicitors to make a friendly approach to shareholders. The solicitors made clear that I was only interested in acquiring some or all of their shares if I could be sure of gaining voting control. Three responded positively. However, it soon became clear that insufficient shares would be available to gain control, so I turned my attention to other matters. I had wanted to be sure of gaining voting control before buying shares because I had researched the law in England concerning minority shareholders. Although there are a number of remedies available to 'oppressed minorities,' a trek through the courts would be costly, with no guarantee of success. Two attempts by large minority investors to bring about changes in two fully quoted companies have reminded me of my earlier experience with that private company. In an article in the Weekend FT on April 6 last year I described how my wife and I had invested in Liberty, the fabrics and stores group, because we felt it had undervalued assets and was a 'quality company selling quality goods in interesting stores.' We also felt that increasing Japanese investment in companies with strong brand names might help to make Liberty a takeover target. In September last year it was announced that Brian Myerson, who helped bring about the Japanese bid for Aquascutum, had acquired a shareholding in Liberty. In February it was announced that Concerto, which represented Myerson's interests, had requisitioned an extraordinary general meeting to try to give votes to holders of Liberty's non-voting shares, with a compensatory bonus issue of shares to the holders of the existing voting shares. While I agreed with Concerto that Liberty's board needed strengthening - and I felt its main London store could do with improvements - compared with most store groups Liberty's performance has been impressive. I felt that Concerto's proposals were unlikely to meet with success at the egm, even although it owned 15.03 per cent of the voting shares and 7.60 per cent of the non-voters. The Liberty family's holding in the company was considerably larger, and they were unlikely to vote in favour of Concerto's proposals. I also thought the share price was unlikely, in the short term, to increase further. I was concerned that, if Concerto decided to sell its shareholding, the share price would suffer. My wife, therefore, disposed of Liberty shares in her personal equity plan on June 15, receiving 666p per share; although for my personal pension scheme I took a longer-term view and decided to retain its Liberty holding. Although more than 100 shareholders attended the Liberty egm, I was not one of them. Concerto's proposals received the backing of only 19.7 per cent of the voting shares and 24 per cent of the non-voting shares, so I await further Concerto developments with interest. Liberty shares are now around 613p for the voters and 435p non-voting. Another company that was recently the subject of circulars from a large minority shareholder is British &amp; American Film Holdings. I first bought shares in this in July, 1985, paying 183p per share, because I was impressed with Sir John Woolf's investment expertise as chairman and managing director. My faith was rewarded. By August 1990 the shares had reached 610p. I viewed the company as a long-term investment, and my personal pension scheme has also bought shares. When Sir John Woolf first acquired a majority shareholding in British &amp; American almost 25 years ago, another company acquired a 20 per cent holding. It disposed of that holding in September 1989 and it was bought by Allied Entertainments, a successful private company involved in popular and classical concert promotions and film and television production. Allied was concerned about British &amp; American's dividend policy and wanted the company to increase the level of dividend payments. Sir John said his company had always followed 'a consistent investment and dividend policy,' and the company's growth in net assets had regularly outperformed both the FT All-share and investment trust indices. Since Sir John had taken management control, the net asset value of the shares had increased 44 times. Excluding film rights in productions such as Oliver and The Day of the Jackal, the company's net asset value at May 8 had reached 903.6p. This, however, must be rather disappointing to any shareholder wishing to sell the shares, as recent deals have only been done in the 550p-to-700p range. It comes back to my old saying: 'A share is only worth what someone is prepared to pay for it.' I am happy with British &amp; American's dividend policy, with the company using a reasonable proportion of its generated cash to increase its investments and capital growth. It was clear that Allied was not happy. It was also clear that companies associated with Sir John Woolf could easily outvote any opposition. I attended British &amp; American's annual general meeting on June 30 and supported the management's position in their defeat of Allied's proposals. But then, I was not 'locked in' to a large minority shareholding which might prove difficult to sell, as dealings in British &amp; American's shares have, until recently, always been limited. Investors seeking 10 per cent, or more, of a small company should always ask: do I like the company's record and policies? If not, what chances have I of gaining sufficient support to change them? If the answer to these questions is negative, it is probably best to find another - perhaps larger  -company in which to invest.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (1) Section 182(a)(1)_Emissions Inventory.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 182(a)(1) of the CAA required an inventory of all actual emissions from all sources, as described in section 172(c)(3) to be submitted by November 15, 1992. On November 13, 1992, the Cabinet submitted an emission inventory on the Ashland-Huntington area. The Cabinet submitted revisions on October 15, 1993, and July 8, 1994, addressing EPA comments. EPA is proposing to approve the inventory in this notice. Final approval of this redesignation is contingent on final approval of the emissions inventory.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (2) Section 182(a)(2), 182(b)(2)_Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Subsequent to the 1977 Clean Air Act Amendments, Boyd county was designated as not meeting the O <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  NAAQS on March 3, 1978 (43 FR 8962). The Commonwealth was subsequently required to revise its O <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  SIP for this area to meet the requirements of section 110(a)(2) and part D of the 1977 Clean Air Act. On January 25, 1980, August 7, 1981, November 24, 1981, November 30, 1981, and March 30, 1983, EPA fully approved Kentucky's SIP as meeting the requirements of section 110(a)(2) and part D of the 1977 CAA (45 FR 6092, 46 FR 40188, 46 FR 57486, 46 FR 58080, and 48 FR 13168). On December 31, 1987, EPA deemed that this control strategy had not resulted in the attainment of the NAAQS for O <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in the Ashland-Huntington area. Consequently, Greer C. Tidwell, Region 4 Regional Administrator, sent a letter to Wallace G. Wilkinson, Governor of Kentucky, on May 26, 1988. This letter, pursuant to section 110(a)(2)(H) of the 1977 CAA, notified Kentucky that the SIP was substantially inadequate to achieve the NAAQS for O <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in Ashland-Huntington and called upon the Commonwealth to revise the SIP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 1990 CAA amended section 182(a)(2)(A), and Congress statutorily adopted the requirement that O <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  nonattainment areas correct their deficient RACT rules for O <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (RACT Fix-ups). Areas designated nonattainment before amendment of the CAA and which retained that designation and were classified as marginal or above as of enactment are required to meet the RACT Fix-ups requirement. Under section 182(a)(2)(A), those areas were required by May 15, 1991, to correct RACT regulations as required under pre-amendment guidance. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The SIP call letters interpreted that guidance and indicated corrections necessary for specific nonattainment areas. Ashland-Huntington was previously subject to RACT requirements for ozone. Therefore, this area is subject to the RACT fix-up requirement and the May 15, 1991, deadline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Among other things, the pre-amendment guidance consists of the VOC RACT portions of the Post-87 policy, 52 FR 45044 (Nov. 24, 1987); the Bluebook, ``Issues Relating to VOC Regulation Cutpoints, Deficiencies and Deviations, Clarification to Appendix D of November 24, 1987  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Notice'' (of which notice of availability was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  on May 25, 1988); and the existing Control Technology Guidelines (CTGs).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The 1990 CAA also amended section 182(b)(2) which required RACT on all major sources of VOCs for O <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  nonattainment areas designated moderate and above (RACT Catch-ups) by November 15, 1992. The RACT Catch-ups provision required the state to submit a revision to the SIP to implement RACT on: (1) each category of VOC sources in the area covered by a CTG document issued between the enactment of the CAA and the date of attainment; (2) all VOC sources in the area covered by any CTG issued before the date of the CAA; and (3) all other major stationary sources of VOCs that are located in the area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Kentucky failed to meet the May 15, 1991, deadline date for RACT fix-ups and EPA notified the Commonwealth on June 25, 1991, that a finding of failure to submit had been made. This finding of failure to submit was published on October 22, 1991 (56 FR 54554), triggering the: (1) 18-month time clock for mandatory application of sanctions under section 179(a); (2) the Administrator's discretionary authority to impose sanctions under section 110(m); and (3) the 2-year time clock for promulgation of the Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) VOC regulations for this area as required by section 110(c)(1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 18-month period prior to application of mandatory sanctions ended on April 22, 1993. Kentucky submitted SIP revisions through the Cabinet to EPA on February 12, 1992, October 20, 1992, February 17, 1993, and March 4, 1993, all prior to the April 22, 1993, deadline. Because the revisions addressed all RACT Fix-up deficiencies and were found to contain all required administrative and technical components, the 18-month time clock for mandatory application of sanctions under section 179(a) was stopped. A  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  approving the SIP revision submitted on February 12, 1992, was published on October 22, 1993 (58 FR 54516). A  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  approving the SIP revisions submitted on October 20, 1992, February 17, 1993, and March 4, 1993, was published on June 23, 1994 (59 FR 32343).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The February 12, 1992, October 20, 1992, February 17, 1993, and March 4, 1993, submittals also addressed all of the RACT Catch-up requirements except the requirement of RACT on all other major stationary sources of VOC that are located in the area, i.e., all sources that are not covered by a CTG. There is one source in the Ashland-Huntington area that is not covered by a CTG. This source will be subject to a source specific SIP revision requiring VOC RACT. Action on this SIP revision will be under a separate notice on or before final action is taken on this redesignation request. The approval of this redesignation request is contingent upon the approval of this source specific SIP revision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (3) Section 182(a)(3)_Emissions Statements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 182(a)(3) of the CAA required that the SIP be revised by November 15, 1992, to require stationary sources of oxides of nitrogen (NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) and VOCs to provide the state with a statement showing actual emission each year. On January 15, 1993, the Cabinet submitted an emission statement rule. The Cabinet will submit revisions to the emission statement rule to address EPA comments. Action on this SIP revision will be under a separate notice on or before final action is taken on this redesignation request. Final approval of this redesignation is contingent on final approval of the emissions statement rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

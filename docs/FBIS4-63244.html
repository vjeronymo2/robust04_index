			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] The FRANCE PRESSE AGENCY has reported, quoting  sources in the Ukrainian president's entourage, that Leonid  Kravchuk is planning to introduce direct presidential rule in  the Crimea. However, the final decision will depend on the  consultations currently held between Russia, Ukraine, the United  States, and Crimean authorities. The consultations began after  more than 1,000 Ukrainian servicemen were sent to the peninsula  last night.    The Ukrainian Interior Ministry today denied the report that  the troops had been brought in but confirmed the fact that the  Crimean Interior Ministry had been transformed into the Crimean  Directorate for Internal Affairs of Ukraine, and that Colonel  Vladimir Chernyshov had been appointed its head.</p>

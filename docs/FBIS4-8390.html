			<p>BFN     [Text] The government has decided to set up a committee for  defense affairs attached to the Council of Ministers. The new  committee will be chaired by the prime minister, with the  minister of national defense as his deputy. Committee members  include deputy prime ministers, the ministers of internal  affairs, foreign affairs, finance, industry, and foreign  economic cooperation, and the heads of the Council of Ministers  Office and the Central Planning Office.    According to National Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk,  the committee should, above all, deal with reforming the command  structures to bring them closer to West European standards.    [begin Kolodziejczyk recording] In brief, it will mean the  departure from the existing command structures, the setting up  of the post of the commander in chief of the Polish Army, and  land, air, and naval forces commanders subordinated to him.    The next important issue the committee should deal with is  to  put in order the legal foundations for the functioning of the  ministry and the Army. Here I would give priority to the deep  and long-ranging amendments to the law on the public defense  duty, which first of all should introduce a division of powers  between the civilian minister of national defense and the  commander in chief, or, for the time being, the head of the  General Staff of the Polish Army. It is also necessary to  regulate a number of other matters, which are outdated in the  present reality and are even hampering all progress. [end  recording]</p>

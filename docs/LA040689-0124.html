			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: MONROVIA;  </P> <P> HEAD START FINDS A HOME  </P> <P> Two weeks after denying a preschool program permission to operate in Olive  Avenue Park because of residents' opposition, the City Council on Tuesday  unanimously approved Recreation Park as the school's site.  </P> <P> The federally funded program, Head Start, serves children in low-income  families, abused or neglected children, and those with handicaps.  </P> <P> The Community Services Commission voted 4 to 2 last week to approve Head  Start's move to Recreation Park, on Mountain Avenue. The program has to move  from Plymouth Elementary School because the facilities there do not meet state  standards for a Head Start license, said Cliff Marcussen, program director.  </P> <P> Options, the nonprofit child-care agency that runs Head Start, will pay the  city $1 a year to lease a mobile classroom and 3,500 square feet for a  playground.  </P> <P> After a long hearing, during which residents had voiced concerns about traffic  and noise if the program used Olive Avenue Park, the council on March 21 denied  a permit.  </P> <P> Community Services Director Eileen Brownell, who has been working with  Marcussen to find an alternative site since that meeting, said the new site is  surrounded by park space and faces a city maintenance yard.  </P></p>

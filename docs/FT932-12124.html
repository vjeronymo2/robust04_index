			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market report COPPER'S renewed fall early yesterday on the LME destroyed the confidence which had been seeping into other base metals after copper's relative stability over the past few days. Three-month copper fell nearly Dollars 30 in morning pre-market trading to around Dollars 1,885 a tonne as option-related selling, liquidation and Chinese sales touched off sell stops. For the rest of the day the price held in a narrow range, closing at Dollars 1,891. But the damage had already been done to other metals where long positions taken on recent strength were quickly disposed of. London's robusta COFFEE futures closed lower as New York ran into a bout of profit taking after the May contract's advance of more than 6 cents a lb over the previous two days. Dealers said a modest setback was to be expected given the magnitude of the preceding gains. Constructive short-term charts remained the main supportive influence, with fundamentals still considered fairly bearish. GOLD closed higher on the London bullion market after fixing below Dollars 350 a troy ounce. Compiled from Reuters</p>

			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Money Markets: Paper chase IT WAS a tight day in the money markets yesterday with assistance running slower than in recent sessions. Overnight rates hit a high of 13 per cent although expectations that there would be enough paper around tomorrow to satisfy even the hungriest traders helped them fall back to more normal levels of 10 1/2-1/4 per cent by the close. The key three-month interbank rate eased from Wednesday's close of 10 11/16-9/16 to 10 9/16-1/2 per cent. The March short sterling contract implied that there would be no change in UK base rate policy in the next few months, as it firmed a touch to 89.67 (89.66). The Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 1.75bn, due to seasonal government revenues. However, as expected, the Bank took a measured approach to injecting liquidity, giving the bulk of assistance late in the day. 'It was like the 7th cavalry riding over the hill, coming in to rescue everyone,' said one senior dealer. The shortage was comprised of treasury bills and maturing assistance, which took Pounds 621m, and exchequer transactions, which drained Pounds 535m. Repurchase agreements called for Pounds 337m, while the rise in note circulation accounted for Pounds 105m. Bankers' balances were expected to be Pounds 55m below target. In the morning, the Bank bought band one treasury and band three bank bills, and paper for resale on February 25 and 26 totalling Pounds 186m. The rates were between 10 3/16 and 10 7/16 per cent. The Bank said it expected to continue trading in band three paper during the government revenue period, which runs through March. Band three bills last longer than the bank's more traditional band one and two business. The Bank eliminated all but Pounds 271m of the shortage in the afternoon with band one, two and three bill purchases totalling Pounds 1.29bn, at rates of between 10 3/16 per cent and 10 7/16 per cent, and unspecified late assistance. Some Pounds 21m of the afternoon injection was marked for resale on February 25 and 26. In Germany, call rates were quoted at 9.60/65 per cent, compared with Wednesday's 9.60/70 per cent. Traders expected call rates to firm in February. In the US, the Federal Reserve did not act as funds were trading around the presumed target of 4 per cent. However, many expected a drain on funds today.</p>

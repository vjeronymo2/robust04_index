			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Applicants assert that the proposed capital structures of the Funds will not induce any group of shareholders to invest in risky securities to the detriment of any other group of shareholders because the investment risks of each Fund will be borne equally by all of its shareholders. Moreover, applicants further assert that the proposed capital structures will not enable insiders to manipulate the expenses and profits among the various classes of shares because the Funds are not organized in a pyramid fashion, all expenses and profits of a Fund, other than the different class expenses, will be borne  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  by all shares of the Fund, and all shareholders will have equal voting rights, except concerning matters relating to each class' rule 12b&hyph;1 plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Conditions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Each class of shares will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments of a Fund and be identical in all respects, except as set forth below. The only differences among the classes of shares of the same Fund will relate solely to: (a) The impact of the respective rule 12b&hyph;1 plan payments made by each of the classes of shares of a Fund, any higher incremental transfer agency costs attributable solely to the Deferred Option shares of a Fund, and any other incremental expenses subsequently identified that should be properly allocated to one class which shall be approved by the SEC pursuant to an amended order; (b) the fact that the classes will vote separately with respect to a Fund's rule 12b&hyph;1 distribution plan, except as provided in condition 4 below; (c) the different exchange privileges of each class of shares; (d) the fact that only certain classes will have a conversion feature; and (e) the designation of each class of shares of a Fund. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The Trustees of each of the Funds, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, shall have approved the Multi-Class Distribution System, prior to the implementation of the Multi-Class Distribution System by a particular Fund. The minutes of the meetings of the Trustees of each of the Funds regarding the deliberations of the Trustees with respect to the approvals necessary to implement the Multi-Class Distribution System will reflect in detail the reasons for determining that the proposed Multi-Class Distribution System is in the best interests of both the Funds and their respective shareholders and such minutes will be available for inspection by the SEC staff. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. On an ongoing basis, the Trustees of the Funds, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the Act and otherwise, will monitor each Fund for the existence of any material conflicts between or among the interests of the classes of shares offered. The Trustees, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, shall take such action as is reasonably necessary to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. The Adviser and the Distributor will be responsible for reporting any potential or existing conflicts to the Trustees. If a conflict arises, the Adviser and the Distributor at their own costs will remedy such conflict up to and including establishing a new registered management investment company. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. If a Fund implements any amendment to its rule 12b&hyph;1 plan (or, if presented to shareholders, adopts or implements any amendment of a non-rule 12b&hyph;1 shareholder services plan) that would increase materially the amount that may be borne by a class of shares (the ``Target Class'') under the plan, existing shares of a class of shares that converts into the Target Class shares after a period of time (the ``Purchase Class'') will stop converting into the Target Class unless the Purchase Class shareholders, voting separately as a class, approve the proposal. The Trustees shall take such action as is necessary to ensure that existing Purchase Class shares are exchanged or converted into a new class of shares (the ``New Target Class''), identical in all material respects to the Target Class as it existed prior to implementation of the proposal, no later than such shares previously were scheduled to convert into the Target Class. If deemed advisable by the Trustees to implement the foregoing, such action may include the exchange of all existing Purchase Class shares for a new class (the ``New Purchase Class''), identical to existing Purchase Class shares in all material respects except that the New Purchase Class will convert into the New Target Class. The New Target Class or the New Purchase Class may be formed without further exemptive relief. Exchanges or conversions described in this condition shall be effected in a manner that the Trustees reasonably believe will not be subject to federal taxation. In accordance with condition 3, any additional cost associated with the creation, exchange, or conversion of the New Target Class or the New Purchase Class shall be borne solely by the Adviser and the Distributor. The Purchase Class shares sold after the implementation of the proposal may convert into the Target Class shares subject to the higher maximum payment, provided that the material features of the Target Class plan and the relationship of such plan to the Purchase Class shares are disclosed in an effective registration statement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

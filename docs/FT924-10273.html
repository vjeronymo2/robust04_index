			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Vatican admits Galileo was right THE Catholic Church is to set right tomorrow one of its great wrongs. In a special ceremony in Rome, Pope John Paul will formally rehabilitate Galileo Galilei, the astronomer and pioneer of modern physical science who was condemned by the Inquisition in 1633 for daring to prove the earth orbited the sun. The rehabilitation of Galileo is a rare breach in the church's dogmatic approach to infallibility. Cutting through the coded language of the Vatican in reassessing Galileo's achievements, the Holy See is admitting the Church of the day was wrong and the Pisan scientist was right. Galileo fell foul of Rome after publishing in 1632 his famous Dialogue on the Ptolemaic and the Copernican Systems. This defence and exposition of the Copernican view that the earth orbited the sun along with other planets in the solar system ran directly counter to church doctrine based on the Ptolemaic idea of the earth being in a fixed position. Not content with demolishing church doctrine in this respect, Galileo became embroiled in theological controversy by trying to explain the relevance and inconsistency of certain biblical texts in the light of his theory. Despite powerful friends, Galileo was by this time an old man in poor health, and faced with torture he agreed to abjure his 'heresies'. For three years he was obliged as a penitent of the Holy Inquisition to recite the seven penitential psalms once a week and spent the rest of his life under house arrest. His books were removed from the index in 1757 but the church still refused to admit any mistake had been made, despite the clear recognition of his achievement by scientists. The Galileo case thus remained until the advent of the present Pope the most controversial symbol of the clash between science and Christian faith, a subject immortalised by Brecht's play Galileo. In 1979, the Pope announced a commission of the Vatican's Academy of Science to study Galileo's rehabilitation. The commission's judgment after 12 years' deliberation is that Galileo's judges erred in good faith, but they were wrong.</p>

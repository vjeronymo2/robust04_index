A shock grenade hurled to  disperse demonstrators exploded near the place where he was  standing, slightly injuring him in the leg. He was treated on  the spot and is now back home.    Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that a homemade bomb was  thrown at an IDF patrol in the Jabalyah refugee camp.

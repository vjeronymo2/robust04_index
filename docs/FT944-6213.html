			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Government Statements): Change to remove obstacle to provision by employers - Liability insurance The government has moved to meet concern about a possible obstacle to the provision of liability insurance by employers for employees and to payments by employers for employees' work-related liabilities which could have been insured against. The Inland Revenue said the proposal 'would put employees who meet their own liability insurance costs or uninsured liabilities on the same footing as employees whose costs are borne by their employer.' With effect from April 6 1995, the chancellor proposes to: Remove the charge to tax on employees when employers pay for their liability insurance or meet work-related uninsured liabilities. Give relief for employees' own expenditure on liability insurance and work-related uninsured liabilities, including expenditure up to six years after the year in which the employment ends. The Revenue explained: 'Under current income tax law, payments by employees or directors for liability insurance, such as directors' and officers' liability insurance or professional indemnity insurance, do not qualify for tax relief. 'This is because the expenditure is not considered to be incurred wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of the duties of the employment. 'Payments by employers to provide liability insurance which protects employees or directors are taxable as a benefit in kind for directors and those employees earning a rate of Pounds 8,500 a year or more. 'Payments by employees or directors for uninsured personal liabilities arising from their activities at work, such as legal costs in defending an action brought against them, do not qualify for tax relief. Payments by employers to meet employees' or directors uninsured personal liabilities are taxable. 'On 12 May 1994 the Inland Revenue published a consultative paper entitled 'Schedule E: Liability Insurance And Payments To Meet Uninsured Liabilities'. 'There were 92 responses to the consultative paper from representative bodies, financial institutions, the insurance industry and others. Most favoured an exemption from a benefit in kind tax charge for liability insurance premiums paid by employers. 'Responses generally favoured an exemption covering all legally insurable risks. Most responses also favoured relief for payments by employers to meet employees' uninsured liabilities to match any new relief for insured liabilities. 'Most of the responses also said that there should be tax relief for liability insurance premiums paid by directors and employees, and were also in favour of tax relief for expenditure by individuals to meet their own uninsured liabilities. 'The chancellor proposes to change the law to: exempt from any benefit in kind charge directors and employees whose liability insurance premiums are paid by their employer; exempt from income tax payments by employers to meet employees' uninsured liabilities (such as legal costs) arising from their work, but only where the liabilities could have been insured against: in other words, liabilities arising from, for example, criminal convictions will not attract relief; give employees tax relief for expenses incurred to provide their own liability insurance and to meet their own uninsured liabilities, in line with the exemption for employer-funded insurance and uninsured liabilities. 'Relief will also be available to former employees who, after the employment has ceased, pay for liability insurance or meet uninsured liabilities relating to their work. The relief will be given against the income and gains in the year the expenditure is incurred, for up to six years after the year in which the employment ceased. 'The new relief will apply from the tax year 1995-96 onwards. 'It will also have a helpful deregulatory effect by relieving employers of the need to provide the Revenue with details of liability insurance provided for employees or payments for uninsured liabilities. Employees will be able to claim the new relief for their own expenditure on liability insurance and uninsured liabilities on or after 6 April 1995. 'The Department of Social Security intend to bring forward Regulations to parallel the new exemptions for employer-funded liability insurance and uninsured liabilities for National Insurance Contributions purposes. It is estimated that the cost of this proposal will be about Pounds 40m a year'.</p>

			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / UN vote paves way for Serbia's expulsion THE Security Council has rejected the claim of the Federation of Serbia and Montenegro to have succeeded to the seat of Yugoslavia in the United Nations  -paving the way for the expulsion of its delegates. If, as appears certain, the General Assembly endorses the recommendation, Belgrade would have to apply for admission to the UN as a new member. Croatia, Slovenia and Bosnia-Hercegovina, the other principal states of former Yugoslavia, have already obtained independent membership. The council resolution was approved on Saturday by 12 votes to none with China, India and Zimbabwe abstaining after it was revised to take account of Russian reservations. Britain, France and Belgium were the prime movers, following an EC foreign ministers' decision a week earlier. The US enthusiastically backed the proposal and yesterday Germany said it would ask the UN to take a hard line against rump Yugoslavia if it was forced to reapply for UN membership. Mr Klaus Kinkel, German foreign minister, said Serbia and Montenegro should be required to halt aggression against breakaway republics like Bosnia-Hercegovina before being admitted as new members. However, senior UN officials believe the decision is ill advised since international efforts to end the Balkans civil war now under way in Geneva rely on Belgrade's co-operation. Officials fear that humiliating Serbia can only increase peace-making difficulties. Mr Milan Panic, prime minister of Yugoslavia, is scheduled to address the General Assembly this Thursday. But that plan appears likely to be aborted by an assembly vote rejecting his delegation, perhaps as early as tomorrow. If the Belgrade authorities decided to apply for separate membership, the US, Britain and France could be expected to exercise their veto powers at least until substantial progress was recorded in the Geneva talks.</p>

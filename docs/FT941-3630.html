			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / International Company News: Aztec takeover prompts writ The fallout from Poseidon Gold's speedy victory in the ADollars 287m (USDollars 203m) takeover battle for Aztec Mining last week turned nastier last night when PosGold's thwarted rival, Pancontinental Mining, sued the winning bidder. Pancontinental, which had made an all-paper bid for Aztec and seen its terms initially recommended by the Aztec board, said that it had issued a writ in the federal court alleging 'conspiracy to injure' and 'breach of section 615 of the Corporations Law'. Last week, PosGold, which is part of Mr Robert de Crespigny's Normandy Poseidon group, raised its cash offer to 74 cents a share. It then swept into the stock market, acquiring the 37 per cent stake in Aztec held by Alumax, the US group, and a large tranche of shares held by Bankers Trust Australia. Other investors also quickly sold out to PosGold, with the result that the bidder had secured over 85 per cent of its target's shares by the close of the day's trading. Pancontinental's board, however, said that events were 'of an unprecedented nature and give rise to a number of serious legal issues'. The company added that it was 'disturbed that it was offered no chance to renegotiate its agreed merger'. This, it claims, caused a 'very substantial loss' to Aztec shareholders. Since securing control of Aztec, PosGold has questioned whether Pancontinental is still obliged to go ahead with its bid - in which case, PosGold directors have said they would consider the option of accepting on behalf of PosGold's Aztec shares. This would give PosGold a large minority interest in Pancon. Pancon has said that it does not believe that it is required to proceed with the bid. A court ruling is likely to decide the matter.</p>

			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Malawi power shift Opposition leaders in Malawi yesterday gave qualified approval to the appointment of a three-man presidential council to take executive authority, Nick Young reports from Lilongwe. The appointment appears to mark the effective end of the rule of President Hastings Banda, who is in South Africa recovering from a brain operation. Mr Gwanda Chakuamba, made secretary-general of the ruling Malawi Congress party last week, heads the council; the other two are ministers Mr John Tembo and Mr Robson Chirwa.</p>

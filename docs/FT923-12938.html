			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: OSE considers more curbs on stock index trading THE OSAKA Stock Exchange (OSE) may be about to implement further controls on its Nikkei 225 stock futures, despite signs of a shift in business to Singapore. Mr Hiroshi Yamanouchi, president of the OSE, said yesterday that further restrictions on stock index trading could be imposed if there was evidence of volatility in the underlying cash market. Futures and options - an area of trading in which foreign brokers have been notably successful - have been blamed by the Japanese financial authorities for distorting the cash market. Official fingers have also been pointed at arbitrage trading - trading to take advantage of the price differences between the stock futures and cash markets - for exaggerating the falls in share prices. Restrictions on trading in stock index futures, including shorter trading hours, higher margin requirements and commissions, and limits in price movements, have been implemented by the OSE six times during the past two years. The average daily volume of conventional share trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange was 263m for the first six months of 1992. This is 75 per cent down on the peak levels of 1988. There is no shortage of Japanese brokers claiming that price fluctuation created by futures and arbitrage trading on the OSE are scaring investors away. One by-product of trading restrictions is that the OSE is beginning to lose business to the Singapore International Monetary Exchange (Simex), where the Nikkei 225 futures can also be traded. The tighter regulations have reduced liquidity and limited price movements on the OSE. Average trading volume in the Osaka Nikkei 225 futures for the first six months of this year has fallen 42 per cent to 52,972 contracts. On Simex, trading has surged 4.8 times to 10,692 contracts. An OSE official said the moves to regulate futures trading were experiments to see whether futures trading affected the cash market. 'Since the cash market has not recovered despite the restrictions, many critics of futures and options trading seem to be reviewing their arguments,' he said.</p>

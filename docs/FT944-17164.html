			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Foreign speculators raise the stakes: Enthusiasm for Russia's stock markets is growing, but the risks remain great In recent weeks Moscow's more opulent hotels have been crammed with foreign investment bankers, venture capitalists and fund managers, chattering excitedly about a possible turn in Russia's economic fortunes. 'This is one of the greatest investment opportunities of the 20th century,' enthuses one fund manager. 'Russia is the single most important emerging market for us at the moment,' says another, Mr Mark Donegan, an equity strategist at Morgan Grenfell, the UK-based merchant bank. This interest has triggered a wave of speculative buying. In the past six months foreign investors have been flocking into Russia's infant stock markets, causing the prices of some shares to jump by as much as 30 per cent a day. Some shares have risen 10 times in dollar terms over the past year, or about 25-fold in rouble terms. According to Mr Anatoly Chubais, privatisation minister, the rate of foreign portfolio investment has accelerated to Dollars 500m a month, compared with about Dollars 1bn for the whole of 1993. CS First Boston, the international investment bank, estimates total foreign portfolio investment this year may exceed Dollars 3bn. But the excitement still needs some explaining. Headline statistics suggest Russia's economy is still mired in recession, with industrial production having fallen 28 per cent in the past year. The government is under severe budgetary pressure. The rouble is falling fast. Thousands of companies are experiencing an acute cash-flow crisis and many have not been able to pay their workers for months - one industrial company, for example, recently resorted to settling its wage bill in job-lots of tampons which it had somehow bartered. Yet the picture is far from uniform. While some parts of the Russian economy are contracting, others - particularly in the services sector - are growing at a frenetic pace. The mass privatisation of 120,000 state-owned enterprises is also proving a brutally effective learning process for Russia's old-school management in how to run their companies profitably. The speed of the privatisation has meant many of the most attractive assets have been hastily bundled into corporate parcels. That has created some powerful and potentially wealthy industrial companies, which could yet dominate the Russian economy in the way giant corporations helped shape US development in the 19th century. It is these few corporate colossi, mainly clustered in the oil, gas, mining, metals, electricity and telecommunications sectors, which most appeal to western investors - especially following increases in global commodity prices. These companies are fast learning how to speak the language of western investors to attract much-needed capital. Lukoil, one of the most progressive of the new oil companies, has already made slick investment presentations in New York. Five other Russian companies, which may issue global depositary receipts - or certificates representing shares  - next year, staged a well-received investment road show in London last month. The investors' prayer is that these companies could eventually produce phenomenal returns from their rich assets. One investment bank calculates that if Gazprom, which controls more than 30 per cent of the world's known gas reserves, could generate the same financial return on assets as its western peers, and attract an equivalent stock market rating, it would emerge as the most valuable company in the world. Despite spectacular share price rises recently, such assets still appear cheap by global standards. The Moscow Times index of the 30 most actively traded Russian stocks estimates their total market value at about Rbs74bn (Dollars 26bn). Put another way, the bulk of Russia's vast natural resources and corporate assets is currently given about the same value as Glaxo, the UK pharmaceuticals company. While this theory may be enticing, much remains uncertain - and there is plenty to alarm the investor. 'In many respects, Russia is a pre-emerging market and lacks many of the most basic playing rules. We will see a number of problems and scandals in the market. That is only to be expected,' says Mr Martin Andersson, chief executive of Brunswick, a Swedish-owned, Moscow-based stockbroker. Russian accounting remains opaque and the concept of corporate governance hazy, making it impossible to value Russian companies on conventional measures of earnings, cash flow or dividend yield. Instead, appraisals have to be made on factors such as proven reserves, share of global metals production, price per unit of energy produced - or even density of telephone lines. There is inevitably a large dash of wishful thinking thrown in. If there were ever a reconciliation of accumulated inter-enterprise debts, many Russian companies would surely be bust. Far from being cheap, many current share prices could yet look absurdly generous. The other chief worry is the sheer difficulty of trading shares, a reminder of the old saw that an emerging market is one from which you cannot emerge in an emergency. A dozen relatively orderly local stock exchanges have been set up, but 95 per cent of shares are still traded over the counter through a myriad of small brokers - many of whom dabble in commodities from shares to human hair. One frustrated western fund manager says: 'The biggest task is simply trying to get buyers and sellers to meet. It is still very difficult to know what the price of a share is.' Prices quoted to investors often prove meaningless and the spreads between bid and offer prices can be as wide as 40 per cent. Even when shares are bought, it is extremely onerous to register ownership. Legislation requires new owners to enter their names on a shareholder list kept in the company's home town. Travel-weary stockbrokers spend much time scurrying off to obscure Siberian towns simply to register their purchases. Local stockbroker associations have been formed to address these concerns and introduce self-regulation. Western government-funded projects are also helping develop effective clearing and settlement systems. Banks, such as CS First Boston and Chase Manhattan, are establishing custodial services to give investors greater confidence about the security of their investments. But mainstream investors will remain deterred until such doubts are resolved. The Russian government is drawing up further securities legislation, which promises effective regulation. It is also devising means of channelling the domestic savings pool into the productive economy, rather than into speculative investment schemes, which could give the markets a further boost. The successful development of secondary markets would solve many government dilemmas. A strong domestic shareholder culture would help entrench the economic reform process and produce greater industry accountability. Capital markets would also provide an alternative means of development finance, helping wean industry off state credits. But the success of the reform-minded ministers is far from assured. It is only a year since tanks were shelling the Russian parliament building, and the political situation remains precarious. Russian nationalists are already campaigning about what they see as a sell-out to foreigners, and there remains a danger of expropriation. The economy, too, could unravel in the face of social unrest, demands for industrial subsidies and a further spurt of hyper-inflation. As yet, only the hedge funds and private individuals have been bold enough not only to identify the risks but to swallow them. Their interest is clearly to talk up the market and take their gains by selling out to incoming fund managers. That may already be happening as Russian share prices have softened in the last few days. But there is a chance that the astonishing speed of change in Russia's capital markets could presage the start of much longer-term growth in investment, as mainstream fund managers and Russian domestic investors grow confident enough to commit serious funds. 'I would like to think that this is not a passing emerging-market fad,' says Mr Andersson of Brunswick. 'The sheer size of Russia's resources and companies must one day ensure that it assumes an appropriate place in the world's equity markets.'</p>

			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Lookers surges to Pounds 1.5m LOOKERS, the motor dealer with Rover, Nissan, Daihatsu and Seat franchises, lifted interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 615,000 to Pounds 1.54m. An added boost in the six months ended March 31 1993 was a Pounds 377,000 profit on the sale of 51 per cent of the contract hire business to Woodchester Credit Lyonnais. That led to gearing being reduced from 98 per cent at September 30 to 53 per cent. Mr William Martindale, chairman, said the first two months had been hit by an exceptional fall in used car values. But then profits of the dealerships improved as sales rose; in particular, profitability of the Essex depots were 'markedly improved'. Total sales moved up to Pounds 163.8m (Pounds 154.4m). The agricultural business was expected to produce a better result over the year, while the caravan division should correspond closely to last year. Mr Martindale said current trading was more profitable than last year, but the climb out of recession would continue to be slow. Earnings per share came to 2.6p (losses 0.9p). The interim dividend is again 2p.</p>

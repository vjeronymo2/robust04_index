			<p><P> May 9, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Dickinson Debevoise ruled in Newark, N.J., that two  insurance companies must pay for an expensive new anti-cancer procedure for a  man with a bone marrow malignancy. Nicolae Dozsa, 54, of Jefferson Township,  N.J., was accepted in December for autologous bone marrow transfer at Johns  Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. He has been unable to receive the treatment  because Crum &amp; Forster Organizations, the insurance company for which his  wife works, refused to cover it, ruling that ABMT is experimental for patients  with multiple myeloma. Debevoise said that Crum &amp; Forster and Prudential  Insurance Co. of America, which administers the plan, failed to abide by their  own policy. The estimated cost of the treatment is $75,000 to $125,000.  </P></p>

			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: European Commission urged to find proposals for savings - Agriculture, Fisheries and Food The government continues to believe that European Union expenditure on the Common Agricultural Policy remains too high. The government will be urging the European Commission to come forward with proposals for savings, in addition to those on school milk and beef intervention which have already been announced. In a statement the government said its planned expenditure on the Common Agricultural Policy is expected to rise to Pounds 2,640m in 1994/95, Pounds 2,880m in 1995/96 and Pounds 2,920m in 1996/97, increases of Pounds 130m, Pounds 190m and Pounds 230m respectively. Provision for spending on UK domestic agriculture has been set at Pounds 1,080m in 1994/95, Pounds 1,130m in 1995/96 and Pounds 1,120m in 1996/97, decreases of Pounds 40m, Pounds 40m and Pounds 50m respectively (rounded figures). This reduction takes place against a background of rising real farm incomes and of firm control of public expenditure. The provision for expenditure on the Common Agricultural Policy reflects the implementation of the reforms agreed last year. Under the agreement market support prices for the main agricultural commodities will be progressively reduced over three years and direct payments to farmers will increase. This means that more of the cost of agricultural support will be borne by the EC budget, but in overall terms this increase in budgetary costs will be more than offset by a reduced burden on consumers. Domestic Agriculture, Fisheries and Food: The decisions also need to be seen against the background of very healthy movements in farm incomes. In 1992, total income from farming, the main measure of farm incomes, rose by 11 per cent in real terms. Figures for 1993 will be published at the end of January. But already it is clear that there will be a further and larger rise in 1993. These were assisted by the net 13 per cent devaluation of the green pound since September last year, and the reduction in interest rates, from 12 per cent to 5 1/2 per cent, over the same period. Changes which have been made in the domestic agriculture programme provision include the following: Protection of the public: The provision for compensation for the slaughter of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) suspect animals has been increased by about Pounds 20m in 1994/95 in line with revised forecasts of the number of cases expected and the average market price for cattle. The amount allocated for flood defence and coast protection in England and Wales in 1994-95, although Pounds 7m less than previously allocated, will nevertheless allow for an increase of Pounds 13m in expenditure over the current year's forecast. Provision stands at Pounds 289m over the next three years. Enhancement of the Rural Environment: During 1994, the Agricultural Departments will, subject to the agreement of the European Commission, introduce the new agri-environment schemes on which consultations took place this spring. In Englad six new Environmentally Sensitive Areas will be launched in March, with first agreements starting in September and first payments made in April 1995, a rescheduling of five months. During the course of 1994 the ministry will also introduce a new option in all ESAs to encourage farmers to create new opportunities for public access, as well as new Nitrate Sensitive Areas to protect drinking water sources, a Moorland Scheme to improve the condition of heather ad shrubby moors, a Habitat Scheme to create or improve a rage of wildlife habitats, an Organic Scheme to encourage farmers to convert to organic production methods and a Countryside Access Scheme to encourage farmers to create new opportunities for public access on set-aside lad. The ministry's forecast expenditure on payments to farmers in ESAs is set to rise from Pounds 20m this year to Pounds 43m in 1996/97. Over the same period the provision for the other new agri-environment schemes will rise from zero to Pounds 19m. For the UK as a whole the annual provision for payments to farmers under these schemes will rise to Pounds 91m in 1995/96 and to Pounds 94m in 1996/97. Capital Grants: Grants will continue to be available under the farm and Conservation Grant Scheme, at reduced rates, towards the cost of installing or improving waste handling facilities, for activities such as the provision, replacement or improvement of hedges ad traditional walls, and for the repair or reinstatement of traditional farm buildings. Details of the new rates, which are expected to yield savings of nearly Pounds 12m in the UK in 1994/95, are contained in a separate news release issued today. Present rates will be maintained for special assistance for works undertaken as part of approved conservation plans in ESAs.</p>

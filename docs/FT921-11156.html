			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / UK Company News: US court agrees MCC interim financing A US COURT last night approved an interim financing arrangement that will allow Maxwell Communication Corporation (MCC) to pay its bills until February 21. The agreement, which was supported by the UK court-appointed administrators and the New York lawyer responsible for the company's filing for protection from creditors under US bankruptcy law, will allow payments to be made for administration, overheads and salaries. The funds will be drawn from a Pounds 15m credit facility in addition to a Pounds 3.6m the court approved earlier this month. The interim funds would be used to pay 75 per cent of expenses incurred in the administration and could include over Pounds 800,000 of payroll, overhead and other miscellaneous expenses due in February.</p>

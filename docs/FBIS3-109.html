			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Mohamed Okorejo] </F>   [Text] General Sani Abacha, the Nigerian head of state, put  it most appropriately when he told a visiting Cameroonian envoy  a few days ago that no problem should be too big for the two  brotherly nations to solve at the conference table. Responding  to a message from President Paul Biya (?suing) for peace along  the Nigeria-Cameroon border, Gen. Abacha said he would gladly  host President Biya for talks on the protracted border  skirmishes.    The Cameroonian delegation came at the heels of an open  confrontation along the border following irritating incursions  into Nigeria's Bakassi Peninsula by Cameroonian gendarmes. For  a very long time now, the gendarmes have harassed Nigerians  living on their own side of the border often on the excuse of  going after fleeing tax defaulters. Thousands of Nigerians have  been displaced and abused in the process. Lagos had often  treated such complaints at the diplomatic level so as not to  spark off a war. Perhaps this gave the false impression that  Nigeria could be a pushover in such matters. But the truth is  that Nigeria, though a war-tested nation that can hold its own  against any onslaught whatsoever, regarded the antics of  Cameroon as undeserving of serious attention. It should be  known that Nigeria did not want to react to the siege of its  [word indistinct] because Cameroon cannot be a match for Nigeria  when it comes to war.    Besides, it is apparent that Cameroon is being a pawn in the  hands of those who do not wish Africa well. Nigeria knows this  and does not want to oblige those who seek the dismemberment of  the continent. However, certain internal feuds among  communities in the eastern extremities of Nigeria called for the  deployment of troops there to restore order. The trigger-happy  gendarmes, not quite versed in military strategic movements,  panicked and struck blindly. If there were any doubts about the  maturity and forbearance of the Nigerian authorities over this  matter, such doubts have been dispelled by a highly placed  Cameroonian, Mr. John Fru Ndi, leader of the Cameroon Social  Democratic Front, SDF. He owned up to a foreign radio station  that the conflict was sparked off by Cameroonians. According to  him, the Cameroonians in question were seeking an outlet for  their internal frustrations. But, this is rather infantile  because Nigeria does not want a spillover of the politics of its  neighbors nor is Abuja known for territorial ambition.    However, this short confrontation must have shown the  Cameroonian authorities the futility of their aggressiveness and  the need to resolve the matter through genuine dialogue. But,  first, Yaounde should accept that it put the cart before the  horse when President Biya sought to internationalize the  dispute. President Biya ought to know better than fall in for  international do-gooders whose only aim is to emasculate Africa  of its potential as a world power. President Biya and his team  are welcome any day and can expect openness from Nigeria, but  they should realize that Nigeria will no longer fall for delay  tactics or double talk. This is because Nigeria can no longer  allow her nationals to be abused and maimed by any country. The  sacrifice for African unity should not be a one-sided affair  just as the quest for transborder peace should be a collective  responsibility.    Ironically, there are over 2 million Nigerians currently  engaged in active trade with their Cameroonian counterparts  while nearly a million Cameroonians are either studying or doing  business in Nigeria. This has been so for centuries. This  Saturday's [26 February] action goes beyond ordinary  neighborliness and when it is known that there are uncountable  marriages across the borders one wonders what really is amiss.  For decades, the Nigerian-Cameroon Commission has worked hard  to eliminate disputes along the common border but it seems that  try as it can, there is a (?mistake) somewhere down along the  line. This is what the Abacha-Biya talks should identify and  find a solution to in the interest of the sociological  well-being of their two countries.</p>

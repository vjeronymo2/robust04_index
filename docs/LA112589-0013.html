			<p><P> November 25, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SOCKERS HELP SOMEONE ELSE OUT OF SLUMP  </P> <P> The Sockers ran into another team desperate for a victory on Friday night, and  they paid dearly for it.  </P> <P> Kansas City's Greg Ion took a pass off the boards from Dale Mitchell and scored  with 26 seconds left, giving the the Comets a 4-3 victory and snapping their  four-game losing streak.  </P> <P> It was the Sockers' second loss in three nights to a team in dire need of a  victory. Wednesday, the Wichita Wings snapped a three-game losing streak by  defeating them, 4-2.  </P> <P> "This was a game for us to take," Sockers defender Kevin Crow said, "and we  didn't pull it out. Give them credit for sticking with it, but that game was  for the taking."  </P> <P> Indeed, the Sockers (4-4) appeared to have the game in hand late in the fourth  quarter. First-year forward Rod Castro gave them a 3-2 lead with his eighth  goal and second of the game 7:03 into the fourth quarter. But Kansas City  caught the Sockers on two counter-attacks, and Jan Goossens and Ion scored  goals within 3:03 of each other, giving the Comets (4-4) their first victory  since Halloween.  </P> <P> Achieved in front of 13,390 at Kemper Arena, it was paramount to the Comets,  who play their next four games on the road, including next Tuesday at the San  Diego Sports Arena.  </P> <P> "I thought maybe we deserved to win," Sockers Coach Ron Newman said. "It could  have gone either way. It certainly was a game we didn't deserve to lose. I just  thought Lady Luck jumped out of the seats and landed right in (Comet Coach)  Dave Clements' lap."  </P> <P> Of Ion's game-winner, Newman said, "It was a nothing ball, really, and he  barely reached it and got a toe on it, and it landed in the net.  </P> <P> "It's the kind of goal you dream about."  </P> <P> Ion made it come true after Mitchell played the ball off the boards and in  front of Sockers goalkeeper Victor Nogueira.  </P> <P> "What Mitchell did for me was attract my man (Jim Gabarra)," Ion said, "and I  shouted for him to play it off the boards, and it was just far enough in front  of me to get a toe on it.  </P> <P> "Maybe this will get us going again. A game like this tends to do that. All of  a sudden, it picks you up, and it gives you confidence in a lot of things  instead of second-guessing yourself all the time."  </P> <P> Socker Notes  </P> <P> The Sockers had a 5:30 wake-up call this morning in order to return home for  tonight's 7:35 game against the Baltimore Blast at the Sports Arena. It will be  the first meeting between the two teams since the Sockers defeated Baltimore in  the MISL Championship Series last spring. . . . Kansas City visits the Sockers  on Tuesday night. . . . Former Charger Coach Al Saunders, now the receivers  coach for the Kansas City Chiefs, attended Friday night's game.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 14, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHINA IN TURMOIL;  </P> <P> U.S. TO SPEED UP VISAS FOR CHINESE WHO WANT TO FLEE  </P> <P> The Bush Administration pledged Tuesday to assign additional diplomats to  process visas and do "whatever it takes" to help Chinese citizens trying to  flee their strife-torn country for the United States.  </P> <P> Although the Administration promised only to give a yes or no answer promptly  to visa requests, a State Department official said that, in practice, a high  percentage of the requests probably will be granted to allow Chinese to escape  the government crackdown on the pro-democracy movement.  </P> <P> At the same time, pressure was building on Capitol Hill to impose additional  economic sanctions on China in response to the regime's sweeping arrests of  democracy demonstrators. The chairmen of the Asia subcommittees in the Senate  and House, Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) and Rep. Stephen J. Solarz (D-N.Y.),  issued separate calls for further action against the Beijing government.  </P> <P> "I would favor immediately dropping the People's Republic of China from the  list of countries getting most-favored-nation trade treatment, and I would  consider other steps in the future," Cranston said.  </P> <P> Solarz visited the State Department to urge additional sanctions. A spokesman  said Solarz argued "that because of events in Beijing since the initial  crackdown, we need to do more than the President announced last week."  </P> <P> President Bush suspended arms sales to China and halted U.S. military contacts  with the Chinese army after the June 4 massacre in and around Tian An Men  Square but he has taken no additional steps in response to the continuing  crackdown.  </P> <P> State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said long lines of Chinese  seeking visas have formed outside the U.S. Embassy in Beijing and at consulates  in other cities. The visa sections in Beijing and Shanghai, the nation's  largest city, have been closed, but Tutwiler said they will reopen today. She  said the U.S. consulates in Canton, Shenyang and Chengdu are operating  normally.  </P> <P> However, Tutwiler said that normal operations may prove to be inadequate in the  face of the expected demand for temporary permission to come to the United  States.  </P> <P> "We will be monitoring the requirements to assure that staffing levels are  adequate to provide the full range of consular services, including visa  issuances," she said. "If it's above the normal load of visas, whatever it  takes to process visas" will be done.  </P> <P> At issue are non-immigrant visas, usually granted to students, tourists and  business people. For Chinese citizens who have passports, the visa is all that  is needed in order to leave the country. They are approved at the discretion of  U.S. consular staff members after they state a valid reason for wanting to come  to this country.  </P> <P> In practice, however, only a relative handful of Chinese citizens hold  passports. A Chinese citizen can generally obtain a passport only for  government-approved travel abroad and often has to surrender it on return.  Thus, the State Department move is unlikely to make a significant difference in  the number of Chinese able to come to the United States, although it may help  some students with passports who previously had been denied U.S. visas on the  grounds that their true intent was to emigrate.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Extended Current Visas  </P> <P> The Justice Department last week extended all visas currently in effect because  of the unsettled situation in China. Officials said it is unlikely that any  Chinese already in the United States would be sent home until conditions in  China improve.  </P> <P> "The detention or arrest of people for exercising their basic human rights of  freedom of expression and free association is contrary to internationally  recognized standards," Tutwiler said in the Administration's first direct  reaction to the wave of arrests by the Chinese government.  </P> <P> Tutwiler said that Secretary of State James A. Baker III received on Tuesday a  comprehensive list of possible options for new U.S. sanctions. But she said  that no immediate action is planned.  </P> <P> "This is nothing more than a list of options, should a situation ever  materialize so that you would be ready, you would not have to spend the hours  that the people have spent to pull them together and collect all the  information," Tutwiler said. "This is not something that has been sent to him  in the form of recommendations. . . . Which options he might or might not  choose, I don't know. He doesn't know."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Most Americans Have Left  </P> <P> As a practical matter, most possible U.S. economic sanctions have already been  overrun by events. For instance, in recent years the U.S. government attempted  to put economic pressure on Libya by ordering U.S. business people to leave the  country. There is not much point in doing that in China because almost all  American citizens have already fled the country. Similarly, an embargo on new  U.S. investment in China would seem to be superfluous, at least for the time  being.  </P> <P> Sen. Richard G. Lugar (R-Ind.) told a breakfast meeting with a group of  reporters that "business in China is pretty much dead" so there is very little  left that would be affected by sanctions. Lugar, a member of the Senate Foreign  Relations Committee, said the chances of salvaging U.S.-China relations are  fading rapidly and "it simply may not be possible to restore good relations  with this particular Chinese government."  </P></p>

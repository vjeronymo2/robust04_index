			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview between Nomura Securities President Hideo </F> Sakamaki and NIKKEI KINYU securities division reporter Akira  Suzuki; place and date not given]    [Text] Prospects for profitability on the part of  securities firms have brightened, stock prices are gradually  recovering, and the four leading securities firms will show  recurring profits for the fiscal year ending in March 1994 for  the first time in three years. On the other hand, the operating  environment does not permit optimism in view of the decontrol of  brokerage fees for high-volume transactions beginning in April  of this year and the establishment of securities subsidiaries by  city banks between July and November. We asked top officials of  the leading securities firms for their management strategies to  be used in operating their firms during this difficult period.    [Suzuki] We understand that a specific numerical target was  set for the first time at your department and branch managers  conference for a return on equity of 3 percent.    [Sakamaki] In my first three years as president I have  placed  importance on systems in terms of building a foundation. In the  next three years, I will look for improvements in not only  systems but in results as well. Establishment of specific goals  will clearly define the direction in which we wish to head. A  return on equity of 3 percent represents the average for  companies whose stocks are listed on the exchanges, but we have  a need to reach 100 billion yen in recurring profits. In the  year ending March 1993, just over 10 firms attained recurring  profits of 100 billion yen, but I do feel it is a reachable goal.    [Suzuki] I understand you'll be implementing new managerial  accounting and personnel systems.    [Sakamaki] We can summarize a company president's work into  accounting and personnel. The current personnel system was made  over 20 years ago in 1970 and now contains a number of revisions  which make it look like extensive patchwork. We must now modify  the system so that recognition is given for productivity. The  reason is that we face foreign securities firms' competition  immediately next door.    [Suzuki] The past several years have witnessed criticism  that  Nomura has not fulfilled its role as the industry leader.    [Sakamaki] As an example, I do not believe that leadership  consists of Nomura engaging in major stock transactions to be  participated in by other securities firms. Rather, I believe  leadership consists of Nomura, including its Nomura Research  Institute, actively engaging itself in the development of new  products and improvement of market features such as tax reform  relative to securities. Development of new products does involve  considerable cost, but it is a fact that we have contributed to  the industry as a whole in this respect.    [Suzuki] What sort of retail strategy have you prepared for  the new fiscal year?    [Sakamaki] We would like to beef up our research services in  their second year and emphasize investments in securities on a  scheduled [cost averaging] basis. Such accounts could easily  total 3 million for the industry as a whole. Since we are seeing  increasing volumes of financial instruments that pay only 1  percent in net return, there is greater appeal for investments  in stocks of companies whose future prospects are improving.  This year will witness a resumption of secondary offerings and  an increase in initial public offerings. I think we will see  increased liquidation of interlocking stock ownership. The next  three to five years will require extraordinary efforts on the  part of the industry to raise the ownership of stock by private  individuals as a means to absorb stock made available through  such liquidation.    [Suzuki] What sort of strategy do you envision for overseas  operations?    [Sakamaki] The total valuation of stocks listed on the Tokyo  Stock Exchange when I was hired by Nomura was about 2 trillion  yen. We now have other Asian markets operating on a similar  scale. Asia is now ripe for both human resource and capital  investments. U.S. firms have clearly assumed a policy of  establishing local subsidiaries. Our American subsidiaries  employ 900 of which only 5 percent are Japanese. Our European  subsidiaries have not been localized as much as our U.S.  subsidiaries but our basic policy consists of localization of  human resources and horizontal integration.    [Suzuki] I assume you will cooperate in aid to Sanyo  Securities and assist in its secondary offerings?    [Sakamaki] Although Sanyo is not affiliated with Nomura, we  have collaborated in the request for aid after obtaining  confirmation of separate actions in the reconstruction of its  nonbank element and the parent Sanyo. We will expeditiously  determine that there are no financial problems and underwrite  the stock offering. In any event, we hope that Sanyo will make  quick progress towards recovery through self-help efforts.    [Suzuki] What will be the effects of establishing securities  subsidiaries by city banks?    [Sakamaki] I believe it will become a case where the city  banks encroached upon territory they considered greener  pastures, but will find that they were in reality pastures  remaining in decay forever, resulting in bad times for both  banking and securities industries. We will engage in competition  when appropriate, but as a special member of the Securities  Dealers Association of Japan, we would like to see city bank  securities subsidiaries cooperate with other securities firms in  playing a confrontational role against parent banks in expanding  direct financial markets.    President Sakamaki looks back at the past three years and  comments, "It was a period for changing the cultural aspects and  building a new foundation for the company." If one is to  consider his tenure of six years, he must use the next three  years in building a new Nomura Securities on top of the  foundation just built. The past several years have witnessed  many accusations of "Nomura being a sleeping lion," and there  were times when dissatisfaction was expressed by the younger  company employees and former senior officials of the firm  relative to its operations. (Future installments will be carried  in General Financial News section.)    One board member comments, "It would be normal to feel some  doubt about one's management policies if he heard so much  criticism, but Mr. Sakamaki was not affected in any way."    A relief pitcher, suddenly designated as such just when the  bases are loaded with no outs, endeavors to minimize errors and  confidently begins pitching straight balls. President Sakamaki  states, "Nomura has not increased its net worth since I became  president. It's about time that we started making investments  for the future." There is a feeling that we will see the return  of a strong Nomura.</p>

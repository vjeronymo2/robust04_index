			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / International Bonds: Abbey National takes advantage of bullish Eurolira sector THE Bundesbank's decision to cut interest rates provided a bullish backdrop for the international bond market, and helped to ensure a good reception for yesterday's trickle of new bond issues. Abbey National Treasury Services launched a L200bn, 10-year issue with a 10 per cent coupon which attracted considerable interest from investors who cherish a high return, especially continental European retail investors. The borrower was particularly keen to take advantage of the bullish tone in the Eurolira sector. 'The interest in Italian lira stems from people looking for the extra yield,' said Mr Roger Bates, at lead-manager Deutsche Bank London. 'For investors, this is probably one of the few remaining chances to buy a double-digit coupon, added to which this is a well-respected borrower.' The German rate cut boosted the Italian government bond market and helped to lift prices in the Eurolira sector. The bonds, issued at 101.075, traded within full fees of 2 points throughout the day, rallying to 99.80 by mid-afternoon. Abbey National last tapped the Eurolira sector in June 1991 with a five-year issue. Mr Alex Brown, head of capital markets at Abbey National, said the proceeds would be used to fund the UK bank's mortgage subsidiary in Italy. The bonds were swapped into floating rate lira to give funding at the London interbank offered rate. Rank Xerox Finance yesterday tapped the Eurosterling sector with a Pounds 125m, 10-year issue priced to yield 105 basis points over the 10-year gilt. CSFB, the lead manager, said the deal was snapped up largely by UK investors although there was some overseas interest. Other sterling houses praised the deal, noting that there has been good demand for sterling paper recently. 'The deal offers a healthy spread over the gilt, and there are plenty of UK institutions looking for greater yield enhancement' said one syndicate head. Mr John Edwards, deputy group treasurer at Rank Xerox, said the borrower had been keen to extend its debt profile and take advantage of the relatively attractive swap opportunities. Some of the deal was swapped into floating rate sterling while some was kept in fixed rate sterling.</p>

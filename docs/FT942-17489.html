			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Company News (This Week): French giant likely to return to profits - Suez A highlight of France's corporate calendar this week will be the announcement on Wednesday of the 1993 results of Suez, one of the country's largest holding companies with a web of interests across French industry and finance. Suez, which fell into the red in 1992 for the first time in its history, is universally expected to have come back into the black during 1993, but the likely level of profits is unknown. Mr Gerard Worms, the chairman of Suez, trumpeted the group's return to the black when he announced a net interim profit of FFr516m (Pounds 59.1m) in the first half of last year. The group has since stepped up its asset sale programme, notably with last autumn's lucrative deal to sell control of Colonia, the German insurer, to Union des Assurances de Paris, the French insurance group. Yet investors will be as interested to hear Mr Worms' views on the timing of future asset sales as in the results themselves. Of particular interest is the fate of Groupe Victoire, the French insurance company of which Suez gained full control following the Colonia deal with UAP. So far Victoire's prospective purchasers - from the UK's BAT Industries to Germany's Allianz - have denied interest in it. Suez's shareholders must be hoping for news about the progress of the sale.</p>

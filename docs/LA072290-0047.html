			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: THOUSAND OAKS;  </P> <P> RANKS SWELL AT GOLF CLUB AFTER MEMBERS DECIDE TO BUY IT  </P> <P> Nearly 500 people -- far more than expected -- have joined the North Ranch  Country Club in Thousand Oaks since members announced two months ago that they  are purchasing the club and championship golf course from Prudential Insurance  Co. of America.  </P> <P> Club officials had hoped to sell 400 memberships by Dec. 24.  </P> <P> "We did not expect this type of response," said members' attorney Tony  Ciasulli.  </P> <P> He said a competitive club fee and an aggressive marketing campaign contributed  to the early success of the membership drive.  </P> <P> Memberships for golf course privileges were selling for about $42,500, with an  additional $4,250 for tennis court privileges.  </P> <P> Ciasulli said officials hope to sell an additional 100 memberships at $60,000  each.  </P> <P> The members decided to purchase the club for $28 million after the New  Jersey-based company announced several months ago that it is selling its golf  courses and country clubs.  </P> <P> According to Ciasulli, the members were fearful that foreign investors might  purchase the 27-hole golf course, 12 tennis courts and clubhouse on 250 acres  of rolling hills north of the Ventura Freeway.  </P> <P> The sale will transfer control of the club to members and change the membership  to an equity or share in ownership of the operation.

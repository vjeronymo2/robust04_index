			<p><P> June 3, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEFENDANT BRAGGED OF SLAYING, WITNESS SAYS  </P> <P> The former brother-in-law of Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt testified  Friday in the so-called "Cotton Club" murder case that one defendant bragged  about shooting producer Roy Radin six years ago and another had to drink a  bottle of wine before he could join in the slaying.  </P> <P> William Rider, who was also chief of Flynt's personal security force from 1976  through 1983, testified during the preliminary hearing in Los Angeles Municipal  Court that the publisher hired as many as 25 bodyguards after an assassination  attempt in 1976 left him permanently paralyzed and wheelchair bound.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hired 2 Defendants  </P> <P> Among those Rider hired to watch over Flynt's Bel-Air mansion and his  magazine's headquarters in Century City were Alex Lamota Mentzer and William  Molony Marti, two of the defendants charged in the murder six years ago of  Radin.  </P> <P> Radin, a 300-pound producer from Long Island, N.Y., was attempting to  co-produce the motion picture "The Cotton Club" with former Paramount Pictures  production head Robert Evans shortly before he was shot to death near Hungry  Valley Road in northeast Los Angeles County. His body was found June 10, 1983.  He had been shot repeatedly in the head.  </P> <P> Evans went on to produce "The Cotton Club" with two Las Vegas casino operators,  Ed and Fred Doumani. The movie, directed by Francis Ford Coppola and written by  Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist William Kennedy, did not recoup the more than  $40 million that it cost to make.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fighting Extradition  </P> <P> Prosecutors contend that reputed drug dealer Karen DeLayne (Lainie) Greenberger  contracted for Radin's murder after they quarreled over her share of profits  from "The Cotton Club." Greenberger allegedly introduced Radin to Evans several  months before Radin disappeared May 13, 1983. Greenberger is charged along with  Marti, Mentzer and Robert Ulmer Lowe, all former Flynt bodyguards who worked  for Rider. Lowe is fighting extradition in Maryland.  </P> <P> After Radin's disappearance, but before published reports of the discovery of  his body, Marti and Mentzer boasted to Rider of shooting Radin to death, he  testified.  </P> <P> "Alex liked to make fun of Radin and called him Rodan," Rider said. Marti, a  native of Argentina, was extremely anti-Semitic, Rider testified.  </P> <P> Rider said Marti told him that he had emptied his gun into Radin the night of  the murder but that Mentzer had to drink a bottle of wine before he, too, could  find the courage to shoot the producer.  </P> <P> Defense attorneys asked Municipal Judge Patti Jo McKay to halt Rider's  testimony after less than 30 minutes, arguing that Rider had made several  statements from the stand that had never turned up in prosecution tapes or  transcripts the defense had requested in prehearing discovery motions. Under  rules of evidence, the prosecution is required to turn over such material to  the defense upon demand.  </P> <P> McKay ordered Deputy Dist. Atty. David Conn to return to court Monday with all  of Rider's debriefing notes as well as with the investigating homicide officers  who made those notes to ascertain whether defense attorneys have everything  they demanded in discovery.  </P> <P> In earlier testimony, actor Grady Demond Wilson, best known as the character  Lamont Sanford on the late '70s television series "Sanford and Son," ended four  days on the stand Friday by announcing that his autobiography, chronicling his  move from cocaine-abusing entertainer to Christian preacher, is due in  bookstores in September.  </P> <P> His part as the gun-toting bodyguard, actor, friend and client of Radin is not  included in the book, he testified.  </P> <P> Wilson testified that Radin asked him and his former secretary to park outside  the Hollywood Regency hotel the night of May 13, 1983, and to follow Radin to  La Scala restaurant for dinner. Wilson said he has the right to carry a  concealed weapon because he was once deputized by a judge in Louisville, Ky.  Radin feared that "something might happen" to him as a result of his  involvement in "The Cotton Club," Wilson said.  </P> <P> Wilson lost Radin's limousine in traffic on Sunset Boulevard and never saw him  again, he testified.  </P> <P> The preliminary hearing is being conducted to determine whether prosecutors  have enough evidence to bind Greenberger, Marti and Mentzer over to Superior  Court for trial in Radin's murder.  </P></p>

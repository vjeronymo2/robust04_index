			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Roger Boyes article: "Europe Under Germany"] </F>   [Text] Amid the fireworks of reunification, Hans Dietrich  Genscher, the grey fox of German diplomacy, made a promise to  Bonn's worried neighbours. "Rest assured," he said, "you can  expect a European Germany rather than a German Europe." Does  anyone now remember that pledge?    Only weeks before Germany takes over the presidency of the  European Union [EU], it is threatening to flout European law by  banning British beef imports for fear of mad cow disease. Its  politicians are grumbling loudly about Germany's budget  contribution. Inside the country the mood is at its most  Eurosceptical for four decades; all the major and minor parties  are contesting the European elections with hard-nosed,  nationally centred rhetoric. There is no sign of Herr  Genscher's "European Germany."    Instead, the political class seems to have opted for a  German  Europe. The naked assertion of power abroad is replacing the  frothy vision of Europa. Bonn has been quietly subverting the  Greek EU presidency for months. It was the Foreign Minister,  Klaus Kinkel, who threatened to break the spine of his Spanish  colleagues unless they allowed the Scandinavian states into the  Union. (Explanations for this rugged phrasing include: "a  mistranslation", "just a joke" and "the minister's robust  Swabian manner".) It was Germany, not Greece, which engineered  the compromise on voting rights for the extended Union. And it  was Chancellor Kohl who leaned most heavily on the European  Parliament to admit the new boys from Scandinavia and Austria.  Germany, in short, has taken charge. In July, it takes the job  formally.    The French have noticeably lost ground in the past nine  months. But Britain, which could have profited from these rifts,  fumbled the issue of European voting rights, and the beneficiary  was Germany, which is now the unchallenged protector of Central  Europe within the Union.    This steady assertion of German power comes at a time when  the country is relatively disadvantaged. It is hamstrung by  elections, its economy is still in recession, its constitution  limits its military posture abroad. By 1996, the economy should  have recovered. The constitution will have been amended, or be  open to more flexible interpretation about German missions  abroad. The European Parliament will be more powerful, more  federally inclined -- and more German.    The driving force behind this new definition of Germany  within Europe is Chancellor Kohl. There are times when his  physical bulk seems to be a metaphor for his country: not just  big, but complicated, thin-skinned, slightly uncoordinated,  capable of sitting out crises, perpetually tired yet capable of  sudden bursts of energy. The Chancellor's Christian Democrats  are catching up in the polls, gaining a second wind after  lagging for months behind the Social Democrats. His room for  electoral manoeuvre is limited, however. On most issues, there  are no clear differences between the two parties. Increasingly,  all seems to depend not on Kohl's utterances but on the success  or failure of his small coalition partner, the Free Democrats,  who may fail to capture the 5 per cent of votes needed for  parliamentary representation.    So the battlefield has shifted to foreign grounds. Herr  Kinkel, the Foreign Minister, is the Free Democrats' chairman.  Herr Kohl is the supreme foreign policy maker. Together they  can make a powerful point by running Europe. The federal  European dream barely enters this calculation partly because it  might scare away voters. Instead, Herr Kohl treats Europe as his  personal playground, where he disports with "Dear John" and "My  Friend Felipe," and of course "Cher Francois." Herr Kohl's  message is clear: I am not only the Chancellor of reunification,  but the fixed point around which Europe revolves. Remove me and  this small universe collapses.    But what would happen to Europe if Herr Kohl were turfed out  in October? The current betting is that either the Christian  Democrat/Free Democrat alllance will survive, or that the Free  Democrats will flounder and Herr Kohl will have to make common  cause with the Social Democrats. Neither outcome would derail  Germany's European policies. Only a Red-Green government could  do that.    British Eurosceptic calculations about a changed European  environment helping to bail out the Conservative Party are  misplaced. Yes, Spain and Italy appear to be more sceptical  than in the past; even Bavaria is striking different notes. But  German interests are now clear: to build Europe into a bulwark  of security against future buffeting; to expand the range of  Europe and consolidate its institutions; and to create layers  and layers of cushions between Germany and an unstable Russia.  For the German political class, much more than in Britain, the  Bosnian war has been a profound shock. Helplessness in the face  of a European war has contributed far more to the current  cynicism than the protracted debate about Maastricht. Fear of a  collapsing Russia, rather than expansionism, is directing much  of Germany's behaviour. So this new assertiveness in Europe  should not worry Germanys partners. Better that the Continent  has a strong heart than a weak stomach.</p>

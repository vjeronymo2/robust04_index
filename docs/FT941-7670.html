			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Honda set to revise all Rover contracts Honda intends to continue all its current projects with the Rover group, despite its decision to sever its equity link with the UK carmaker. But it has told BMW, the German executive and luxury carmaker which is acquiring Rover from British Aerospace, that it wishes to renegotiate all the existing Honda/Rover contracts in the light of the change of ownership of the UK carmaker. The Japanese carmaker is expected to seek a significant increase in its licensing royalties and components prices as the price for it continuing the series of licensing agreements and components supply deals which underpin more than two-thirds of Rover's current car production. The renegotiation would involve the Rover 200, 400, 600 and 800 series, and threatens to reduce the profitability of the Rover business, which returned to an operating profit last year after two years of losses. Honda supplies around 8 per cent of Rover's total materials and components purchasing. It is understood that the assurance that the Japanese carmaker intended to continue all 'present and presently planned projects' was given by Mr Nobuhiko Kawamoto, Honda president, when he met Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder, BMW management board chairman on Monday. Publicly Honda has said only that it intended to withdraw from its 20 per cent equity holding in the Rover vehicle operations. The assurance appears to calm fears that the BMW takeover of Rover - BMW is paying Pounds 800m and assuming Rover group net debt of Pounds 200m and off-balance sheet funding of Pounds 700m - could lead to significant disruption of production at Rover's UK plants. BMW believes that the Honda assurance also means that the Japanese carmaker will press ahead as planned with the so-called HH/Theta project to develop a new generation of cars to replace the current Rover 200/400/Honda Concerto sister cars. This project is already well advanced, and the Honda version of the new car is due to enter production in the autumn at the Japanese carmaker's plant at Swindon, Wiltshire. Rover will start production of its version of this family car shortly afterwards at its Longbridge, Birmingham, plant. Many components suppliers to Honda and Rover are at an advanced stage in preparing to supply parts for this new car range - the most important volume car in the Rover line-up - and any delay would have been disruptive to them. While Honda is expected to adopt a tough stance in the contract renegotiations, BMW will be able to use the lever that the Rover business is also a profitable part of the Japanese carmaker's operations. Rover is thought to contribute pre-tax profits of around Pounds 100m to Honda. BMW's purchase of Rover should be complete by mid-March. Lex, Page 26</p>

			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / Gatt chief backs regional pacts REGIONAL trade deals are neither a rival nor an alternative to the multilateral trading system, said Mr Arthur Dunkel, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), yesterday. He dismissed as 'rhetoric' threats to pursue regionalism by countries frustrated by the current deadlock in the Uruguay Round of Gatt trade talks. His remarks, to a seminar in Rio de Janeiro on economic integration in the Americas, come just over a week after completion of negotiations on a North American Free Trade Area (Nafta) between the US, Canada and Mexico. The Nafta deal has reinforced fears, especially in Asia, that the world may be splitting into warring trading blocs with high trade barriers against outsiders. Mr Dunkel said multilateralism and regionalism could not only co-exist but reinforce each other. The quest for freer trade in the Uruguay Round had strengthened interest in speeding the process regionally. But some issues could not be tackled effectively in a regional framework. Gatt's founders saw global and regional approaches to trade as two sides of the same coin, he said. Gatt lays down rules for creating free trade areas and customs unions, designed to ensure above all that regional integration should not be at the expense of third parties. Mr Dunkel said that, while this might seem utopian, free trade areas could provide gains for members and non-members alike. The Nafta accord is expected to come under close scrutiny by other Gatt members insisting it must be consistent with international fair trade rules.</p>

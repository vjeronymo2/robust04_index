			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Commission to study US airline industry THE CLINTON administration is calling for a commission to be set up to produce solutions to what it calls the 'crisis' in the US airline industry. 'I think it is very clear we have a crisis,' said Mr Federico Pena, transportation secretary, as he backed calls for an airlines commission yesterday. Mr Pena said the 15-member commission, with five members each nominated by the president and the Senate and House leaders, should complete its report in 90 days. 'It's not going to be a report that's put on a shelf somewhere,' Mr Pena said. Mr Pena was joined by both Democratic and Republican congressmen, who said the Dollars 8bn (Pounds 5.6bn) of losses generated by the airline industry over the last three years made the situation critical. Air transport policy came to the fore in last year's election campaign as the airlines lobbied fiercely over whether whether British Airways should be allowed to take a large stake in USAir. United, Delta and American, the three biggest US airlines, continue to oppose the proposed tie-up and have been pressing for an inquiry. They argue that allowing BA to proceed would give it complete access to the US air transport market while they remained shut out of the British market and cost them more than Dollars 500m a year in lost revenue. Besides problems of foreign competition, the US airlines also complain that they suffer from excessive regulation and from the unfair competition of airlines which continue to operate while under the protection of the bankruptcy code.</p>

			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Books: Murder and more - Anthony Curtis concludes a two-part look at anthologies Bernard Shaw, you will recall, divided his dramas into plays pleasant and plays unpleasant. The same division applies nowadays to anthologies. The unpleasant kind was put firmly on the map with The Oxford Book of Death. Now we have The Faber Book of Murder edited by Simon Rae (Pounds 17.50, 575 pages). It proceeds alphabetically: Axe (Lizzie Borden), Cement (Doctorow's Billy Bathgate), Dismemberment (Ian McEwan's The Innocent), Double (R L Stevenson's Jekyll and Hyde), Garotte (Patricia Highsmith's Ripley's Game), Hanging (Kipling's Danny Deever), Quits (Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus) and Zarathustra (Nietzsche). And there are many more just as ugly. 'Whether we like it or not' says Rae, 'murder is a regrettable scarlet thread running through the human tapestry'. He decided early on to spare us 'all contemporary murders of a private nature' but this does not exclude mass murder and genocide. The book is ballasted with an extract from Freud's Totem and Taboo and from the deliberations of De Quincey and other thinkers who have pontificated about murder. It is, I must admit, a compilation of undeniable fascination. Stephen Brook has made an equally thorough trawl through the literature of personal betrayal, sometimes in extreme cases leading to murder, in The Penguin Book of Infidelities (Viking Pounds 17.00, 376 pages). A painful topic makes for some entertaining reading. On the pleasanter side of the scales, The Faber Book of The Theatre edited by Ronald Harwood has now appeared in paperback (Pounds 8.99, 267 pages). The well-known playwright, formerly an actor and a stage-manager, includes some amusing extracts under the headings of Before the First Performance, Performance and Players, After the Performance. Meanwhile the ever-industrious Sheridan Morley has compiled The Methuen Book of Movie Stories (Pounds 15.99, 270 pages) which contains fictional accounts of film-making in Hollywood and elsewhere. Anthologies are not merely aimed at the Christmas market. They burgeon all the year round. One about to appear in the spring likely to appeal to FT readers is The Oxford Book of Money edited by Kevin Jackson. Naturally he quotes Oscar Wilde in the person of Lord Darlington defining a cynic as 'A man who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing'. But he also includes the often-forgotten pay-off: 'And a sentimentalist, my dear Darlington, is a man who sees an absurd value in everything and doesn't know the market price of any single thing'.</p>

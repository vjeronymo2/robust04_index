			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Russian university already benefiting from training programmes Sir, It was heartening to read John Lloyd's article on Russian plans for reforming economics teaching ('Russia boosts economics teaching', September 6). Certainly, there remains much to be done to improve academic standards and curricula in Russian universities and teaching institutions. The Economic Development Institute of the World Bank recognised this early on and in 1992 established, with the full support of the Russian government, a training centre at the premier Russian university, Moscow State University. The Joint EDI/MSU Training Centre has now been responsible for retraining large numbers of academics and researchers and, perhaps most importantly, for using the skills of those who have been retrained to assume primary responsibility for teaching market economics to a large number of government officials. With the active collaboration of the core economics ministries our centre has developed a large and innovative set of training programmes aimed at improving analytical and policy-making skills, the value of which is quite obvious. The philosophy behind this has been to bring on young Russian academics and teachers to harness their considerable skills in providing up-to-date and technically competent training to officials, journalists and other key audiences in Russia. I should add that this approach and the EDI/MSU Centre has now been cloned, using local institutions, in Kazakhstan, Ukraine and Uzbekhistan. And a similar strategy was used to develop innovative training programmes (and to establish a number of training centres) in banking, project management, investment analysis, enterprise and transport management, as well as privatisation. Mr Lloyd indicates that textbooks are a significant constraint in improving the quality of instruction in Russia. Our centres have now translated a large number of modern texts and articles into Russian, including Gregory Mankiw's excellent recent textbook on 'Macroeconomics'. They have also produced/translated into Russian training videos for bankers and case studies, text books and glossaries for each of the above mentioned programmes.

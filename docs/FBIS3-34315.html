			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Jihad Zayir, Nazirah Nadim, and Rasmiah Minwir] </F>   [Excerpts] Baghdad -- A symposium on facts and  misinformation in Arab and foreign publications on the Mother of  Battles will begin in Baghdad today. [passage omitted]    AL-JUMHURIYAH has interviewed Gilles Monet, secretary  general  of the French-Iraqi Friendship Society, on the sidelines of the  symposium. Gilles Monet said: I have had the honor to be  received by President Saddam Husayn several times. Saddam  Husayn is a man who devotes his life to Iraq, and to place this  country on equal footing with advanced countries. That's why  the 17 July Revolution took place, and under his leadership oil  was nationalized. Monet said that the Iraqis are lucky to have  as their leader a man like Saddam Husayn. He said that the  United States interferes in the domestic affairs of many  countries. It even interfered in France's domestic affairs, as  was the case with respect to the GATT agreement. He added that  it was the United States which forced France to participate in  attacking Iraq. He explained that France's relations with Iraq  have started to improve since Edouard Balladur became prime  minister    Monet said that French companies suffered much from the  blockade imposed on Iraq because they lost many of the  opportunities that that they previously had, not to mention that  France now has a high unemployment rate, and if the blockade is  lifted, this will greatly contribute to settling this problem.    Monet said he greatly admires the reconstruction process  under way in Iraq. He said: The war has had negative results  for the Iraqis but, at the same time, has made the Iraqis carry  out great work. The Iraqis have proved that they have creative  minds and can depend on themselves to attain great achievements.</p>

			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Nigeria acts to avoid poll unrest NIGERIA'S ruling military council has postponed removal of the fuel price subsidy, due on June 1, to avoid unrest in the run-up to presidential elections on June 12. A cut in the subsidy is seen as vital for an agreement with the International Monetary Fund, which began its mission to Nigeria yesterday. The postponement is a setback for the civilian transitional council, which has pledged to cut the budget deficit to help get an early IMF agreement, a pre-condition for rescheduling the country's external debt. The move follows persistent threats of strikes and riots. An official statement after a weekend meeting at the federal capital of Abuja said there would be 'no new pricing of petroleum products' on June 1. 'The government remains committed to ensuring that nothing is done to impede the progress of the transition' to elected civilian rule, it added. The meeting was chaired by President Ibrahim Babangida and included his vice-president, Admiral Augustus Aikhomu, as well as General Sani Abacha, defence minister, Mr Ernest Shonekan, leader of the transitional council, and Mr Philip Asiodu, oil secretary. Mr Shonekan, one of Nigeria's leading businessmen, has been frustrated in his attempts to instil fiscal discipline, achieve a market rate for foreign exchange and stimulate private sector investment. Hopes raised by the 1993 budget and other policy statements have turned to disillusionment, as Mr Shonekan appears powerless to resist military intervention in his reforms. The proposed rise in fuel prices by more than 500 per cent to import parity was also designed to halt smuggling and provide money for maintenance of refineries and distribution systems. Fuel shortages, which have afflicted the north for weeks, spread to the commercial capital, Lagos, over the weekend when a fire closed a depot. Petrol riots are not the only potential threat to peaceful civilian handover. Allegations of misconduct at last month's election of presidential candidates have rekindled demands that the handover be delayed for the fourth time in three years and the National Electoral Commission has made the elections conditional on its screening of presidential running mates, yet to be chosen by the two Moslem candidates.</p>

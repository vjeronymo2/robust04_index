			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Warning over 'credit repair' companies CONSUMERS who want to improve their credit history risk committing fraud if they give false information to get their records upgraded, Sir Gordon Borrie, director-general of fair trading, warned yesterday. He said that consumers should beware of advertisements by 'credit repair' companies. They offer guidance on making a successful credit application and help in removing unfavourable credit history information from credit reference-agency records. 'Consumers who have been refused credit should think twice before paying any fee to these companies,' Sir Gordon said. He added that booklets telling consumers how to make successful credit applications by giving answers that score the most points may be either misleading or incorrect. Consumers whose applications for credit are rejected have the right to be given the names of any credit-reference agencies consulted by a lender and to obtain copies of any information held about them by the agencies. They can have their files corrected if the information is wrong.</p>

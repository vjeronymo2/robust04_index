			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Berenice Gomez Velasquez] </F>   [Text] Following the executive branch's announcement that  the national budget will be reduced 10 percent, the Armed Forces  has reduced its budget for this fiscal year by at least 6  billion bolivares. Very well-informed military sources made this  announcement because no official information is available at the  ministry.    The estimated budget reductions are as follows: Army: 17  percent, which is equivalent to approximately 3 billion  bolivares; Navy: 11 percent, which is equivalent to about 700  million bolivares; Venezuelan Air Force: 7 percent, which is  equivalent to 400 million bolivares; and Armed Forces of  National Cooperation: 16 percent, which is equivalent to about  2.4 billion bolivares.    Reports indicate that Rear Admiral Panayotis Francis Sanchez  was the officer tasked with making the estimated reductions, but  it was not explained why, in certain cases, the reductions were  higher than the recommended 10 percent. There is hope the  figures will be reduced somewhat due to the ongoing war against  narcoguerrillas, Colombian brigands, and Brazilian gold  prospectors on the Brazilian- Colombian border, especially when  the National Armed Forces is being urged to comply with its  duties of providing protection and security in areas that are so  far away that they are nearly inaccessible and where millions  are spent in fuel flying and navigating for hours.    This reduction will affect the four components of the  military forces. It will supposedly affect their operation as  little as possible and funds for gasoline, food, supplies, and  preventive and operational maintenance programs will be left  untouched. Reports indicate there are no plans for acquisitions  this year. There is no indication whether allocations to buy  artwork, pay bonuses and representational expenses, remodel  offices, maintain and remodel the "El Cielo" ministerial  residence and the main residences and summer residences of the  general commanders, and pay the salaries of household personnel  at these residences will be reduced or eliminated.    There is also no indication whether there will be reductions  in allocations for military health, especially when military  hospitals throughout the country are facing problems of scarcity  and private medical care is so expensive. No explanation was  given on whether the reduction will affect the execution of the  main maintenance contract for missile frigates hulls, which was  approved and signed by the Navy, Congefan [National Armed Forces  Comptroller General's Office], and the national Attorney  General's Office.    It is possible the National Guard [GN] will be the most  affected because the "secret funds," which are mostly used to  cover salaries and to partly pay for intelligence work, were  reduced. Therefore, some GN training schools will be closed to  avoid expenses because there will not be enough funds to pay for  new salaries. It is hoped the GN budget reduction will be  reconsidered and reduced to at least one fourth of what was  proposed so as not to affect the GN training.</p>

			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART BUCHWALD: FRENCH ACCENT TWISTS PILGRIMS' TALE  </P> <P> One day a shepherd boy was out walking with his sheep along the Champs Elysees  in Paris when he tripped over a Bouche Noel. In anger, he kicked it and found  this scroll underneath explaining Thanksgiving to the French.  </P> <P> Victor Hugo translated the document, and since then it has provided  enlightenment to generations of French citizens who never understood what  Americans did in November. The original scroll rests in a glass pavilion  designed by I.M. Pei at the Louvre.)  </P> <P> One of our most important holidays is Thanksgiving Day, known in France as le  Jour de Merci Donnant.  </P> <P> Le Jour de Merci Donnant was first started by a group of Pilgrims (Pelerins)  who fled from l'Angleterre before the McCarran Act to found a colony in the New  World (le Nouveau Monde), where they could shoot Indians (les Peaux-Rouges) and  eat turkey (dinde) to their hearts' content.  </P> <P> They landed at a place called Plymouth (now a famous voiture Americaine) in a  wooden sailing ship named the Mayflower, or Fleur de Mai, in 1620. But while  the Pelerins were killing the dindes, the Peaux-Rouges were killing the  Pelerins, and there were several hard winters ahead for both of them. The only  way the Peaux-Rouges helped the Pelerins was when they taught them how to grow  corn (mais). The reason they did this was because they liked corn with their  Pelerins.  </P> <P> In 1623, after another harsh year, the Pelerins' crops were so good that they  decided to have a celebration and give thanks because more mais was raised by  the Pelerins than Pelerins were killed by the Peaux-Rouges.  </P> <P> Every year on le Jour de Merci Donnant, parents tell their children an amusing  story about the first celebration.  </P> <P> It concerns a brave capitaine named Miles Standish (known in France as  Kilometres Deboutish) and a shy young lieutenant named Jean Alden. Both of them  were in love with a flower of Plymouth called Priscilla Mullens (no  translation). The vieux capitaine said to the jeune lieutenant:  </P> <P> ''Go to the damsel Priscilla (Allez tres vite chez Priscilla), the loveliest  maiden of Plymouth (la plus jolie demoiselle de Plymouth). Say that a blunt old  captain, a man not of words but of action (un vieux Fanfan la Tulipe), offers  his hand and his heart, the hand and heart of a soldier. Not in these words,  but this, in short, is my meaning.  </P> <P> "I am a maker of war (Je suis un fabricant de la guerre) and not a maker of  phrases. You, bred as a scholar (Vous, qui etes pain comme un etudiant), can  say it in elegant language, such as you read in your books of the pleadings and  wooings of lovers, such as you think best to win the heart of the maiden."  </P> <P> Although Jean was fit to be tied, friendship prevailed over love and he went to  his duty. But instead of using elegant language, he blurted out his mission.  Priscilla was muted with amazement and sorrow.  </P> <P> At length she exclaimed, interrupting the ominous silence: "If the great  captain of Plymouth is so very eager to wed me, why does he not come himself  and take the trouble to woo me?" ("Ou est-il, le vieux Kilometres? Pourquoi ne  vient-il pas aupres de moi pour tenter sa chance?")  </P> <P> Jean said Kilometres Deboutish was very busy and didn't have time for those  things. He staggered on, telling her what a wonderful husband Kilometres would  make. Finally, Priscilla arched her brows and said in a tremulous voice: "Why  don't you speak for yourself, Jean?" ("Chacun a son gout?")  </P> <P> And so, on the fourth Thursday in November, American families sit down at a  large table, brimming with tasty dishes, and for the only time during the year  eat better than the French do.  </P> <P> No one can deny that le Jour de Merci Donnant is a grand fete, and no matter  how well fed American families are, they never forget to give thanks to  Kilometres Deboutish, who made this great day possible.  </P></p>

			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Safety warning on privatised railway THE frequency and severity of railway accidents could increase unless adequate safety controls are implemented after privatisation, the Health and Safety Commission warned yesterday. Sir John Cullen, commission chairman, told possible franchise-seekers - including Stagecoach and British Rail managers - that there were 'clear safety implications'. New companies with 'little or no experience' of operating the railways could enter the industry. 'They may have staff with limited experience of railway safety,' he warned. The commission has acknowledged the danger inherent in removing responsibility for the railways from one experienced body and giving it to a multitude of possibly inexperienced new companies. After privatisation, operators would have to produce 'safety cases' demonstrating that they had identified risks; established patterns of responsibility for control; and could manage operations without letting safety standards slip.</p>

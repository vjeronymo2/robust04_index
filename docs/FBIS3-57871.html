			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Socialist Party Approves Concept of </F> `New Social Pact'"]    [Text] Francois Mitterrand's end of the year message,  particularly his proposal to set up "a new social pact on  employment," were welcomed positively by the Socialist Party  [PS]. Speaking on Europe 1 [radio station] on Saturday [1  January], PS spokesman Jean Glavany said that he "appreciated"  that Mitterrand had "pointed to the key problem in French  society -- unemployment -- which undermines and ruins  everything." "The fact that the president of the Republic said  that our society could no longer sustain this evil (...) is, in  my opinion, his responsibility as the guarantor of national  unity," he added.    A long-time advocate of this concept, Jean Popperen was  happy  to see that Mitterrand adopted it as his own. "The development  of the situation necessitates this objective," the former  Socialist minister explained, "for otherwise, we are in for  serious social splits (...)." This objective must now be  implemented: It is the responsibility of the whole social  movement. Speaking on France-Inter [radio station] on Monday, 3  January, Laurent Fabius also expressed "the hope that the  government and the business world will follow up this concept."    Officials from the Right had shown little enthusiasm on this  as recently as 31 December. Bruno Megret, the number two man of  the National Front, blamed the chief of state for "surfing on  the wave of events." "With Mr. Mitterrand, politics no longer  means action, rather incantation and good intentions" he said,  adding that "France is now in danger." Yves Galand, chairman of  the Radical Party, said that "calling for a new social pact  would sound more credible if Francois Mitterrand's socialism had  not sharpened inequalities." He added that "the president would  be better qualified to moralize if his seven years in office had  not been marked with `affairs.'"</p>

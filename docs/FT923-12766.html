			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Management: Customers form queue for chips in newspapers - How a UK company seeks success through direct sales of personal computers The assembly line machinery comes from Taiwan, as do the printed circuit boards, but the finished computers are British. They are designed and built in a low rise development that would not seem out of place in California's Silicon Valley, but is actually only a hundred metres from London's busy North Circular road. The manufacturer is Elonex, a six-years-old privately held company which is confounding those who doubt that the UK has a future in the personal computer business. It is already sixth in the UK with a 4.6 per cent market share behind IBM, Compaq and Apple of the US, Olivetti of Italy and Britain's Amstrad. According to Romtec, the market consultancy, Elonex is the UK number one in direct PC sales, made through newspaper advertisements, mail order or personal recommendation without recourse to distributors or retailers. Direct sales is the fastest growing segment of the PC market in the UK, echoing a trend in the US where computers are increasingly being sold on price alone. All the established manufacturers are having to deal with this rapidly expanding, low-priced end of the market where there is little difference between machines and where gross margins are wafer thin. While the big companies struggle to find new strategies, Elonex has managed to grow and increase profitability through the recession. It is now increasing its profits at 25 to 30 per cent and last year it made some Pounds 10m pre-tax profit on sales approaching Pounds 60m. Elonex's trading performance is not in itself enough to worry the PC industry's larger players. What should be giving executives at IBM, Compaq and even Dell - the US pioneer of direct selling - restless nights is the way Elonex seems to be able to master the fast-changing rules of the personal computer game. Elonex applies three fundamental principles. Cost of sales is kept as low as practicable. Israel Wetrin, the company's managing director, studied electronic engineering at London University and spent time as a general dealer in Taiwan. He started the company selling clones built by the Taiwanese company Copam from his North London flat. Prudent habits have stuck. He keeps cost of sales between 8 and 10 per cent of turnover and makes a net profit of between 10 and 17 per cent. Margins are fixed: savings in the costs of components are passed directly on to the customer. 'This way we can put pressure on the big boys,' Wetrin says. 'Unless they can reduce their cost of sales from 40 to 10 per cent, they will never make it.' Comparisons are always difficult but one of Compaq's new low-cost range at Pounds 1,045 in the UK is still substantially undercut by a Pounds 835 Elonex with more features. Components are bought at keen prices. The bulk buying power of the large PC manufacturers is largely a fiction, it seems. The company is currently producing only 7,000 machines a month but Wetrin says: 'Our purchasing power is about the same as IBM or Compaq. The only component larger companies can buy more cheaply is the microprocessor.' Labour costs, for small or large companies, typically work out at only about 5 per cent of total manufacturing costs. Products are designed to give a competitive edge. Achieving product differentiation is hard at the low-cost end of the market. Elonex installed semi-automated Taiwanese manufacturing equipment but reckons it has little now to learn from Taiwan. The Taiwanese mass produce identical systems; each Elonex computer is built to a customer's specification, typically within five days. It has established a research facility in Santa Clara, California, and has built relationships with the key component suppliers. It claims a good relationship with Intel, the US semiconductor company which supplies the majority of the microprocessors used in PCs. The Elonex philosophy is well illustrated in the company's product strategy. The current range comprises chiefly desktop models and network servers, which, some might argue, represent yesterday's technology. The excitement in the industry is now focused on laptop and notebook PCs. Desktop systems are selling well, however; the evidence is the Elonex despatch centre where lorry loads of boxed systems addressed to blue chip customers leave every night. Elonex supplies a notebook made by another manufacturer but is about to launch its own design. Wetrin dismisses most of the currently available machines as poor on reliability and battery life. The new systems, scheduled for the end of August, will run for 14-18 hours on one battery charge through a novel choice of display screen options. Elonex is already established in France, Belgium and Israel and will open in Germany this year. Wetrin sums up his strategy: 'We are genuine with our customers and we pay our suppliers on time. We are the ones who worry Dell and Compaq so we must be doing OK.' The success of Elonex may represent the beginning of a new era for British personal computers. Just behind it in market share is Opus Technology, a tiny company with British Rail as its largest customer, which is also profiting from the shift among customers to direct sales.</p>

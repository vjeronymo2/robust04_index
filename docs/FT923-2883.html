			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Morgan Crucible up to Pounds 31m MORGAN CRUCIBLE, the industrial materials manufacturer, yesterday reported a modest 8 per cent fall in earnings per share despite harsh conditions in its markets. Helped by acquisitions, pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 28.5m to Pounds 31m in the six months to July 5, on sales up 8 per cent at Pounds 334.4m. Earnings per share fell from 10.2p to 9.4p and the interim dividend is maintained at 5.75p. Rather than tinker with a small increase in the interim dividend, Mr Bruce Farmer, chief executive, said the group would prefer to make a fuller increase at the year-end, depending on sales in the last four months. Mr Farmer said the group, which has 84 per cent of sales outside the UK, saw some signs of economic upturn in the US and Australia and a good business climate in south-east Asia. Gearing rose to 41 per cent from 26 per cent - a figure that included part of the proceeds of last April's rights issue - but interest cover rose to 8 times. This was after capital expenditure of Pounds 17.3m - excluding acquisitions - which was 1.5 times the depreciation cost. At the operating level, margins fell from 11.5 per cent to 10.5 per cent. Excluding acquisitions operating profits would have fallen 9 per cent. Profits in the carbon division fell despite higher sales, partly because of a freeze in orders from two customers, and price competition leading to falls for the first time in 10 years. Technical ceramics sales, profits and margins rose mainly because of acquisitions, but thermal ceramics' margin was hit by competition in refactory business which was not fully offset by the growth of new applications. Profits at speciality materials were maintained and margins increased despite the relatively poor performance of Holt Lloyd, the car care business, which is undergoing a restructuring. COMMENT Morgan has had a long haul toregain the confidence of investors wary of its predilection for rights issues. But even discounting an 8 per cent out-performance since the last foray into the market, there are grounds for believing Morgan has spent long enough in the wilderness. When compared with its peers, it has performed well for an industrial company in recession with new applications for its technology moving it steadily into higher-value-added areas. And limiting the earnings fall to 8 per cent while maintaining operating margins above 10 per cent is not to be sneezed at. What is more, the group may not have to wait until its self-imposed abstinence from rights issues ends next April before returning to a more active acquisition programme, particularly if it can sell some of its non-core businesses. Add to that a relatively high yield and Morgan looks to be on a modest rating - 12 times prospective earnings based on a full-year forecast of Pounds 67m and 20.5p of earnings.</p>

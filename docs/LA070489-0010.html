			<p><P> July 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GREECE  </P> <P> In response to "From Bad to Worse," editorial, June 21:  </P> <P> As a Greek citizen and scholar I found your editorial very offending. Your  sarcastic statement that Greece "claims" (my quotation mark) to have invented  democracy is insulting to all Greeks.  </P> <P> Especially disturbing is your passing judgment as to how voters of a free  society such as Greece should vote. It reflects an elitist as well as an  interventionist attitude on your behalf. You seem to be nostalgic for the days  when the U.S. government manipulated political life in Greece by undermining  popularly elected governments and assisting a military dictatorship. Well,  those days are long gone.  </P> <P> Greeks have now a true democracy again. It is a democracy free of U.S.  government intervention, and offers, unlike that of the U.S., more than just  two choices. Greeks, like most democratic European nations, have a truly  pluralistic democracy with political parties of the right, middle and left, all  represented in the Parliament. That is the ultimate sign of a true democracy.  </P> <P> Your mocking of the way the Greeks voted on June 19 reflects your true feelings  about Greece. You do not care about democracy in Greece; all you want is a  "friendly government." Unfortunately for you, Greeks have other ideas.  </P> <P> MICHAEL KARADANOPOULOS  </P> <P> Sherman Oaks  </P></p>

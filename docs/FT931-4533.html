			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Survey of Credit Management (10): A lot of time and money - Robert Rice on the implications of recovering debts through the courts USING the courts to recover debts is both time-consuming and costly. There is little point in taking legal action unless the creditor is sure that the debtor has the necessary funds or assets to meet the debt if the court orders payment. Before embarking on court action creditors should see first whether a solicitor's letter or placing the debt in the hands of a debt collector will produce the desired result. Actions to recover debt can be brought in the High Court, the county court or under the county court small claims procedure. The rules governing where an action should be started changed in July 1991, to bring more claims within the cheaper, quicker and less formal small claims procedure and to prevent trivial cases clogging up the High Court. The Pounds 5,000 upper limit on the jurisdiction of the county court was abolished and the court given unlimited jurisdiction. The jurisdiction of the small claims court doubled to Pounds 1,000. Cases are now allocated between the High Court and the county courts on a simple formula basis. Cases involving sums up to Pounds 25,000 should start in the county court as a matter of course. Cases between Pounds 25,000 and Pounds 50,000 should normally start in the county court unless they are complex or involve important questions of law and fact. Cases involving more than Pounds 50,000 should automatically start in the High Court. The High Court also has new powers to transfer cases to the county court either where the case should have started there in the first place or where it feels the case is straightforward enough to be heard at a lower level. In practice, this means a number of cases involving more than Pounds 50,000 will be transferred down to the county court each year. Plaintiffs who attempt to bring an action in the High Court which should have been started in the county court risk having their case struck out. Before these changes a huge volume of debt actions which should have been started in the county court were brought in the High Court. Even in 1991, the last year for which figures are available, 46 per cent of claims brought in the High Court in London were for amounts below the old county court jurisdiction limit of Pounds 5,000. Over 80 per cent of them were debt or return of goods cases. There were a number of reasons for the popularity of the High Court as opposed to the county court in debt cases: the availability of the quick summary judgment procedure; the perceived efficiency of the High Court enforcement officers compared with county court bailiffs; and the availability of remedies not available in the lower courts. Along with the jurisdictional changes, however, the county courts now have powers to make any orders which could have been made by the High Court if the action had been brought there, although this does not extend to the granting of Anton Piller orders and Mareva injunctions. (Mareva injunctions are granted to prevent the transfer of assets and Anton Piller orders to prevent destruction of documents.) Creditors who are anxious to prevent debtor companies destroying assets or transferring them abroad to avoid payment, therefore, may still wish to commence their actions in the High Court. For all practical purposes, however, the county court has become the focus for debt actions. Actions are commenced in the county court by issue of a summons and in the High Court by the issue of a writ of Fieri Facias (Fi-Fa). The procedure after a summons or writ is broadly the same. If the defendant enters a defence the issue may go to trial. County court cases involving sums up to Pounds 1,000 are dealt with by district judges by way of arbitration under the small claims procedure unless they are legally or factually complex. The arbitrations are informal and do not adhere strictly to court procedures. Parties are encouraged to handle small claims by themselves rather than being represented by a lawyer. Legal aid is not available and normally the winning party cannot recover the cost of legal representation from the loser. Alternatively, the defendant may admit the claim and make an offer of payment. If the creditor accepts the offer, judgment will be entered in his favour. If he rejects it, a 'disposal hearing' will take place at which the court will set the amount the defendant has to pay, and, if he is ordered to pay by installments, the amount of each installment. If the defendant fails to respond to the summons altogether the creditor can obtain judgment in default without any examination of the merits of his claim. Where at least Pounds 10 is outstanding on a county court debt one month after judgment the debt is recorded on the Register of County Court judgments. Entries can be cancelled when a judgment is set aside or is paid in full within one month. All entries are automatically removed after six years. Entries on the register can affect a person's ability to get credit in future and act as an incentive to pay off outstanding debts. Once the plaintiff has obtained judgment in his favour and the debt has not been paid he has a 'judgment debt' and can take immediate steps to enforce it. There are various methods of enforcing judgments in the county courts. The most common, but one of the least effective, is the 'warrant of execution' where the court orders an enforcement officer or bailiff to seize and sell by public auction goods belonging to the debtor. Tools of a trade and essential household items are exempt from seizure. The number of execution warrants continues to rise in spite of evidence suggesting bailiffs rarely recover goods sufficient to cover debts. In 1991 the last year for which figures are available 1.47m execution warrants were issued, an increase of 10 per cent in 1990. A creditor can obtain a charging order on a debtor's property, for example, his house. If the debtor later sells the property the creditor is assured of receiving some money. The number of applications for charging orders rose from 34,970 in 1990 to 45,3672 in 1991. Another common form of enforcement is attachment of earnings which obliges the debtor's employer to deduct a set sum from the debtor's salary. The number of orders made in 1991 rose to 54,508 from 48,118 in 1990. A Garnishee order enables money owed to the debtor by a third party (the garnishee), usually a bank or building society, to be held for the benefit of the creditor. The Garnishee order is little used - only 6,380 were issued in 1991. An administration order allows a debtor with multiple debts not exceeding Pounds 5,000 and at least one of which must be a judgment debt which he is unable to pay immediately, to apply to discharge all his obligations by making regular payments into court which are distributed among his creditors on a pro rata basis. When such an order has been made creditors are forbidden to take other enforcement measures without the specific authority of the court. Administration orders can be made on the application of the debtor, a creditor, or by the court itself. The number granted rose by 43 per cent in 1991 to 8,496. Several changes to the administration order were made in the 1990 Courts and Legal Services Act. They include abolition of the Pounds 5,000 limit and need for at least one judgment debt, and the imposition of a three year time limit on the order. If the debtor cannot meet his debts in three years a composition order is made reducing the overall level of debt he is expected to pay. These changes have not yet come into force. A large number of oral examinations designed to help creditors find the most appropriate method of enforcing a judgment are held in the county court each year. Although the oral examination is not a method of enforcement, the fact that a debtor is ordered to attend court to provide details of income, expenditure, employment and bank accounts often results in the debt being paid. Applications for oral examinations increased by 15 per cent in 1991 to 122,084. Methods of enforcement in the High Court include charging orders and Garnishee orders and the appointment of a receiver to manage the judgment debtor's property to protect the creditor's interest in it. If all this fails, a person or company with debts he is unable to meet is 'bankrupt' or 'insolvent'. Creditors may issue a petition for bankruptcy against individual debtors either in a designated county court but more normally in the Chancery Division of the High Court. Creditors may also petition for the winding-up of an insolvent company. There is a restriction on proceedings which may be started in the county court based on the paid-up capital of the company to be wound-up. Most winding-up proceedings are brought in the High Court. If no action is taken to recover a debt for six years it becomes statute barred and no action can be taken. Suppliers should maintain contact with defaulting customers to ensure this does not happen.</p>

On Wednesday [16 February], the European Commissioner  responsible for Cooperation and Development, Mr. Manuel Marin,  will go to Israel where he will meet with Foreign Minister  Shim'on Peres, among others. During his visit, the European  Commission vice president will announce the formal launch of  negotiations aimed at producing a new cooperation agreement  between the Twelve and Israel before the end of the year. This  agreement will replace the old one in effect since 1975, and has  been on the cards for some time in the light of developments in  international relations or certain advances made at the level of  the European Community, e.g., the entry into force of the single  market and Maastricht Treaty, the creation of the European  Economic Area [EEA], and the signature of new agreements between  the Twelve and several Maghreb countries. The drafting of a new  agreement has proven particularly indispensable since conclusion  of the "Gaza and Jericho first" option between the Israelis and  the Palestinians last September.    The agreement constitutes a second dimension of the European  Union's policy in the region, for Europe is the main source of  funds in the Middle East, with a program worth ECU500 million  spread over five years. According to European Commission  President Jacques Delors, the agreement will enable the European  Union [EU] to give guarantees to Israel, which he describes as  "an industrial society whose principal outlet is Europe."    "Israel has changed, the Community has changed, and the  world  has evolved," explains Mordechai Drory [Israeli ambassador to  EU]. "What we are now asking of the Twelve is an updated version  of the economic and commercial chapter of the old cooperation  agreement, entailing adjustments made to the agricultural  dossier, a modification of the original rules and regulations,  or even the extension of free trade to services. As for  scientific cooperation, Israel would also like to be involved in  European research and development programs, especially in the  industrial sector."    Since the early 1980's, trade exchanges between the two  parties have become progressively more imbalanced, to the  detriment of Israel. Israel's trade deficit vis-a-vis the  Twelve rose to ECU3.1 billion in 1992, with the EU remaining the  Israeli Government's leading trade partner -- with Germany ahead  of Great Britain and France on a country by country basis. To  what may this trend be attributed? Mordechai Drory believes  that the main cause has been the lack of European investment,  and the absence of joint ventures between Israelis and European  investors: "People have been reluctant to invest in Israel, due  to the political situation, and the Arab boycott of Israeli  products. Most investments in Israel have been made by major  international groups of U.S. origin, which have not hesitated to  come here, among other things because they are being actively  supported by their government. In the United States there is an  extremely tough antiboycott law, which threatens any U.S.  entrepreneur who responds positively to threats of an Arab  boycott. There is also a law of this kind in some member states,  but not at European level."    Today, agricultural produce represents only 20 percent of  our  exports to the European Community. However, between them, the  Twelve alone absorb nearly three-fourths of Israeli exports of  agricultural products, stresses Mordechai Drory: "Consequently,  in this sector, the European market is of vital importance to  Israel." Furthermore, proportionally speaking, Israel exports  less high-tech products to the European Community than it does  to the United States. "That is mainly due to the fact that a  large share of our industry is concentrated in high technology.  We have few unskilled workers, no raw materials, and a very  high level of research. However, the more highly developed an  exporting nation becomes, the more high-tech products it  imports. The United States has this politico-economic base, so  it imports more products of this kind from Israel. The  situation is different according to the member states."</p>

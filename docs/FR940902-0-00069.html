			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> State Job Training Coordinating Council  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter suggested that there should be a representative of the JOBS program on the Council. The Department agrees that this would be a good step. However, since JOBS representatives can be included within the meaning of ``representatives of state public assistance agencies'', as set forth at section 122(a)(3)(b)(i) of the Act, no change is made in the final regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> State Human Resource Investment Council  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters were concerned that the regulations did not require, or at least encourage, that membership on the SJTCC or the HRIC include the State Agency on Aging or a designee to ensure that the needs of older workers are addressed. It was stressed that such representation on these councils would improve the commitment to older workers and promote the development of integrated service systems for older workers. The Department agrees that the needs of older individuals should be addressed in the provision of JTPA services; however, in interpreting requirements of the Act at sections 122(a)(3)(B)(i)(SJTCC) and 702(b)(5)(HRIC), the Department believes there is already sufficient latitude and flexibility for the Governor to appoint a representative from the State Agency on Aging and further regulation is not necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A commenter noted that it would be helpful to clarify in paragraph (a) of the regulation that, when the State Council on Vocational Education (SCOVE) is incorporated in the HRIC, the HRIC is responsible for carrying out the functions of the SCOVE. The Department believes that this is clear in the provisions of the Act and in &sect;628.215(e) of the regulations. No change is made to the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A commenter suggested that, when the SCOVE is included within the HRIC, it would be beneficial to include the State Director of vocational education on the HRIC since the State Director plays an important role in education within each State, especially in coordination and improvement of educational services. The Department agrees and the final rule at &sect;628.215(c) encourages the Governor to consider appointment of the State Director to the HRIC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A few commenters questioned the accounting basis for funds that are made available to the HRIC. Some wished to ensure that when funds are made available to the council the statutory activities for which they are intended are accomplished. Another commenter pointed out that the requirement to allocate funds on the basis of ``benefits received'' goes beyond the requirements of the Act and the Conference Report, which simply specified that State agencies were encouraged to provide funds in a manner consistent with their representation on the council and that no agency's contribution be disproportionate. The Department has examined this issue and believes that the Act contemplates some flexibility in terms of how the costs of the activities of the Council relate to the various applicable programs. This is particularly true under circumstances in which there is a reasonable contribution on behalf of an applicable program. The Department has determined that, as specified in the Conference Report, the costs of the Council may be allocated upon the basis of the relationship of each funding source to the total funding of all applicable sources or programs that are represented on the Council. Finally, on the condition that there is a reasonable contribution from other involved Federal and State programs, the various activities of the council fall within the overall coordination mandates of the Act and the related costs are allowable JTPA costs to the extent that JTPA funds are available from applicable JTPA sources. The final rule is revised accordingly in paragraph (d).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to clarify the requirement of paragraph (g) regarding the certification of the HRIC by the Governor, the final rule is changed to indicate that the certification is to be in writing with a copy provided to the Secretary of Education.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Education Coordination and Grants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A number of comments were received on State education coordination and grants found at &sect;628.315 of the interim final regulations. In addition to the specific areas discussed below, the comments suggested confusion about the administrative framework for the development of the section 123 program and the need for a general description of the program. The section 123 program is to be a partnership between the JTPA program and the education system in the State. The Act provides a strong role for the State education agency by requiring that funds be allocated to the agency, and that the agency have a central role in planning and in the operation of the program. In order to foster coordination at the State level, the Act requires that the Governor and the State education agency agree on the use of funds as part of the joint development of the education part of the GCSSP. If there is no agreement, the regulations provide that neither party may use the funds. To foster coordination at the local level, the Act requires the State education agency to enter into agreements with the JTPA SDA administrative entities. If there is no agreement with the administrative entity, the Act indicates that the amount of funds specified for the SDA in the State-level agreement may be unilaterally used by the Governor for meeting the goals of section 123(c).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

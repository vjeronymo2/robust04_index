			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 31 May (TANJUG) -- Special Russian envoy  Vitaliy Churkin, who arrived in Belgrade this morning on a new  peace mission, met Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic.    It has not been officially announced what they discussed,  but  it is known that Churkin's mission is linked with the upcoming  meeting on the crisis in former [as received] Bosnia-Herzegovina  on 2 and 3 June in Geneva, convened by UN special envoy Yasushi  Akashi.    TANJUG has learned from reliable sources that after the  talks  with Milosevic, Churkin will have meetings with the leaders of  the republic of Serb Krajina [RSK] and the Srpska republic.    President Milan Martic and Prime Minister Borislav Mikelic,  who are heading the RSK delegation, will hold talks with Churkin  in the Russian Embassy on the resumption of the talks with  Croatia.    Churkin arrived in Belgrade from Zagreb where he obviously  did not conclude his mission because, as AFP reports, he will  return to the Croatian capital this evening to hold talks with  President Franjo Tudjman.</p>

			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Motoring: In the midnight sun with the roof down - Stuart Marshall tests the Saab cabriolet in an Arctic summer SPRING WAS a little late this year in northern Norway. In early June, snow still lay thickly on the tundra. The stunted birch trees were as bare as they had been all winter. Then, overnight, the temperature shot up. The snow began to melt, the rivers ran in spate and the trees grew green almost as you watched. Three days later Spring was over. Summer had come. All this I learned last week when I drove a Saab 900 convertible, roof down in brilliant 24-hour sunshine, from Alta to the North Cape (Nordkapp) and back again. Country and car were perfect partners. With the all-round visibility of an open car, I smelt the countryside, felt the sun and the wind and savoured Norway's arctic north to the full. Well wrapped up and with the heater on, it was pure pleasure to drink in the scenery on the 134 miles (215 km) drive from Alta to the Nordkapp. The road first crosses Stabbursdalen National Park, one of Europe's great wildernesses, then runs up the Porsangen inlet to Kvfjord. From Kvfjord, a super-modern ferry which seems hardly to have docked before it is off again, takes vehicles to Honningsvvg, from which the Nordkapp is another 22 miles (35 km). It is an easy drive. The metalled road from Alta to Kvfjord is beautifully engineered, well surfaced and almost deserted. You have to keep an eye open for suicidal reindeer. And the hood had to go up for the 3 km long Skarvberg tunnel. Water still pours through the roof, just as it did when I drove to Nordkapp from Rovaniemi, 300 or so kilometres to the south and exactly on the Arctic Circle, in the late 1970s. Then it was a tough drive, on dirt roads all the way. Now only the last stretch from Honningsvvg to the cape is unmetalled. It will not be for much longer. Already the bulldozers are busy, which I am sure will please drivers of tourist buses taking thousands of visitors to Nordkapp. The 300 metre high cliffs that fall vertically into the Arctic Ocean are a - literally - fearful sight. But the simple stone hut that, 17 years ago, sold postcards and not much else has given way to a Nordkapp complex. It has restaurants, a multi-screen cinema and huge, picture- windowed viewing area from which to see the Midnight Sun. Seventeen years ago, on midsummer midnight, I had stood freezing on the cliff edge, waiting for the sun to kiss the horizon before climbing skyward. But a snowstorm had swept in from the east and I saw nothing. This time I watched from the comfort of the viewing area but, once more, nature had the last laugh. At midnight, the sky was cloudy. Only while driving back down to Honningsvvg did the half- past-midnight sun blaze out again. Though quite a veteran among convertibles, the Saab 900 is still one of the best. It was conceived at the request of Saab's US importer, unveiled as a prototype at Frankfurt in 1983 and put on sale three years later. The easy way of making a saloon car into a convertible used to be to chop the top off, weld some extra metal on the pressed-steel chassis platform, fit a folding hood and hope for the best. It did not always work. Some hardtops turned into soft tops used to shake like unset jellies on all but billiard table road surfaces. Saab's way - and to be fair, it is now the way of all major manufacturers adding soft-tops to their ranges - was to redesign the entire structure so none of its rigidity or crash protection would be seriously compromised. (One has to say, though, that people riding in the back seat of an open car that rolls over must be at greater risk than they would be in a saloon). Saab also wanted its 900 cabriolet to be a proper four-seater, not a cramped 2+2, with a roomy boot. It had to be refined as well as a good goer, and comfortably usable all year round. So the power-operated hood was triple layered to keep the heat in. There is a defroster in the glass rear window. At first, Saab thought it would make a couple of thousand cabriolets for two or three years, and that would be that. But its launch coincided with a wave of fashion for soft tops in the US. Demand was double that forecast, and waiting lists grew. Last year, 7,765 cabriolets were sold, with 10,000 expected this year. Although the veteran 900 is nearing the end of its life the cabriolet will stay in production for some time after the its successor appears. Eventually, there will be a cabriolet version of the new 900. No-one is saying when, but cabriolets can be remarkably long lived. The VW Golf cabriolet, which is based on the original Mk. I Golf, is still with us, eight years after the Mk. I Golf was replaced by the Mk. II which was itself superseded by the Mk. III last year. Saabs are generally reckoned to be strongly masculine cars, but women love the 900 cabriolet, buying more than one in four of those sold in Britain. I found it a rewarding car to drive. The light-pressure turbocharged engine of the manual and automatic versions I drove gave adequate rather than kick-in-the-back acceleration. But the ride was excellent and the whole car felt as solid as - well, a Saab. With the hood up, one was aware it was not a saloon only because the rear quarters field of vision is restricted. And the rather shallow windscreen - a sign of age - did make it seem beetle-browed when closed up. At Pounds 19,245 to Pounds 26,895 - it depends whether the 4-cylinder, 2-litre engine is naturally aspirated, light-pressure or higher- pressure turbocharged, plus Pounds 832 for automatic transmission instead of a 5-speed gearbox - the cabriolets are at least 25 per cent dearer than equivalent 900 saloons. That makes them quite expensive. But then the best things in motoring life, Saab's car for all seasons included, never have come cheaply.</p>

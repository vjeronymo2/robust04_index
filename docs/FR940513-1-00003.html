			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Amendments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the proposed regulations, a new authority, the Student Educational Employment Program, would replace the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Schedule A authority &sect;213.3102(p) graduate students in scientific, professional or analytical positions; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Schedule A authority &sect;213.3102(q), students in scientific, professional and technical positions, GS&hyph;9 and below; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Schedule A authority &sect;213.3102(v), temporary summer aid; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Schedule A authority &sect;213.3102(w), stay-in-school program; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Schedule A authority &sect;213.3102(y), summer employment; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Schedule A authority &sect;213.3102(jj), legal intern positions; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Schedule B authority &sect;213.3202(a) through (c), (e) and (g), cooperative education program; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Schedule B authority &sect;213.3102(d), Harry S. Truman Foundation Scholarship Program; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Schedule B authority &sect;213.3202(f), Federal Junior Fellowship Program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Using the new program, agencies would appoint students under &sect;213.3202(b) (work study) and &sect;213.3202(c) (temporary). The new schedule B authority would contain both a Work-Study Component, &sect;213.3202(b) and a Temporary Student Component, &sect;213.3202(c). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the new program, the definition of student is an individual who is enrolled or accepted for enrollment in at least a half-time academic course load in an accredited high school, technical or vocational, associate, baccalaureate, graduate, or professional diploma or certificate program. An individual is still deemed to be a student as long as there are no breaks in course work of more than 5 months and the student shows to the satisfaction of the agency and academic institution that he/she has a bona fide intention of continuing to pursue a course of study or training. An individual who has to complete less than half of an academic course load immediately prior to graduating is still considered a student. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agencies may appoint students on a full-time, part-time or intermittent basis at any time during the year. The student's work schedule should not interfere with his or her academic studies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Work-Study Component <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The work-study component provides experience that is directly related to the student's educational program. Agencies should appoint students under &sect;213.3202(b) when the job is related to their academic field of study. Programs developed under this component provide for a schedule of periods of attendance at an accredited school combined with periods of career-related work in a Federal agency. Agencies, participating educational institutions, and students should agree on a formally-arranged schedule of school and work to ensure that work responsibilities do not interfere with academic performance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Students appointed under this component will be classified as Student Trainees, to the -99 series of the appropriate occupational group. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Students appointed under &sect;213.3202(b) (work study) may be noncompetitively converted to a career or career-conditional appointment under Executive Order 12015 when students have: (1) completed within the preceding 120 days an educational program and course requirements at an accredited school; (2) completed at least 640 hours of career-related work, before completion of or concurrently with, the course requirements (agencies have the option of increasing this requirement for some or all of its occupation fields); (3) been recommended by the employing agency in which the career-related work was performed; and (4) met the qualification standards for the targeted position to which the student is appointed. Conversions will be to an occupation related to the student's academic training and work-study experience. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Temporary Student Component <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This component provides flexibility to agencies to appoint students on a temporary basis to jobs that may/may not be related to the students' academic field of study. The intent of a temporary student component is to provide maximum flexibility and opportunity to agencies and students that will meet both of their needs on a short-term basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Classification for students appointed under this component is based on the occupational series for which they are hired. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Schedule B authority &sect;213.3202(c) would be used for students employed on a not-to-exceed 1 year appointment. Appointments under this authority may be extended in 1-year increments as long as the employee is enrolled or accepted for enrollment as a student in a diplomat or certificate program at an accredited academic institution and is performing at the fully successful or higher performance summary level. Students would not be eligible for conversion to a career or career-conditional appointment under this authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Movement Between Components <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Agencies may noncompetitively move students between temporary and work-study components if students meet the requirements for that component. Movement between components will require using the appointing authority for the component that the student is entering. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

Azerbaijan's Ambassador to Russia Ramiz Rizayev told  ITAR-TASS that the Moscow meetings between the Azeri minister  and Russia's Deputy Defence Minister Georgiy Kondratyev have  failed to identify "common approaches, and Mamadrafi Mammadov  intends to meet Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev today.    Azerbaijan insists on the withdrawal of the Armenian troops  from the territories captured simultaneously with the ceasefire  and disengagement of troops. It calls for recording this  provision in the protocol. "We would like to combine the first  and the second phases of the settlement of the conflict,"  Azerbaijan's ambassador told ITAR-TASS.    According to Ramiz Rizayev, Azerbaijan's proposals have met  with support in principle of the Russian minister of foreign  affairs, Andrey Kozyrev.    Experts of the Russian Defence Ministry do not think that  Pavel Grachev will agree to the amendments to the protocol  proposed by Azerbaijan.

			<p><P> June 28, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> CASTING, MIXTURE OF MOODS SET 'A FEW DAYS WITH ME' ABLAZE  </P> <P> Mad passion -- the grand amour that unhinges you, makes you throw away your  life -- is a frequent movie subject. But it's rarely handled with the intense  observation or generous good humor writer-director Claude Sautet brings to "A  Few Days With Me" (Music Hall).  </P> <P> Focusing on the cross-class liaison of an alienated young man, heir to a French  supermarket chain, and the maid of one of his family's managers, this movie has  an almost irresistible narrative drive. Sautet, one of the great artisans of  the naturalistic French screenplay, is dealing with life and death, love that  destroys, but he mixes his moods expertly. He keeps "A Few Days With Me"  incongruously light, deft, humorous.  </P> <P> He portrays pathology by giving it an unflinching gaze, by filling the story  with amusingly eccentric characters and unexpected twists. It's a seeming  romantic tragedy or melodrama told in an engaging comic style. The deceptive,  often lackadaisical-seeming rhythm keeps you constantly off balance, until the  trap is sprung.  </P> <P> Sautet's lovers are played by Daniel Auteuil, the guilt-ridden son of "Jean de  Florette" and Sandrine Bonnaire, the almost scarily independent hoyden of "A  Nos Amours" and "Vagabonde." It's a brilliant piece of double casting. Auteuil,  without his grotesque "Florette" prosthesis and makeup, has the yearning eyes  and delicate, wary features of an obsessive swain. When we first meet his  Martial, recovering from depression in an asylum, he seems vaguely dislocated,  insulated by his family's wealth from life's shocks, oddly unaffected by  everything, including his wife's infidelity.  </P> <P> Bonnaire, on the other hand, has exactly the stuff a man like this -- dreamy,  sarcastic, sensitive, bored -- might get obsessed with. As Francine, whom  Martial meets in Limoges while checking the books of her genial employer,  Fonfrin (Jean-Pierre Marielle), she projects something earthy and unfettered,  seductive in a seemingly uncalculated way. (Bonnaire is the actress audiences  wish Madonna could be.) A practical femme fatale, Francine meets Martial's mad  plunges and rich boy's self-indulgence with a working girl's shrewd  self-interest. And, as he journeys through degradation and disgrace to possess  her, she watches not bitchily or malignly, but curiously, almost bemusedly.  </P> <P> In the 1974 "Vincent, Francois, Paul and the Others," Sautet proved himself a  poet of friendship. He excels at the portrayal of communities and the three  groups he draws here -- the glassy artificiality of the Pasquier family, the  provincial pretensions of the Limoges bourgeois who run the Pasquier stores and  the raw roughhouse swagger and cunning of Francine's friends -- make for a  marvelous collision. It also inspires a marvelous ensemble. Marielle, as the  amiably corrupt Fonfrin and the legendary beauty Danielle Darrieux, as  Martial's mother, give perfect performances; the rest of the cast, notably  Dominique Lavanant as the neurotic Mme. Fonfrin and Gerard Ismael as the  sinister Rocky, are nearly as good.  </P> <P> Sautet indulges all his actors, helps them to their best form. But he doesn't  indulge his lovers. He shows exactly what happens when their worlds clash,  never losing his innate sympathy or his comic, urbane perspective. That's why  the film sustains so well the classic narrative virtues of surprise and  inevitability, and why, in the end, Sautet, Auteuil and Bonnaire can give us  such a devastating last few shots. And it's why "A Few Days With Me" (MPAA  rated PG-13, despite partial nudity) can reveal so convincingly the tigerish  passions that smolder beneath a surface that's deceptively calm, charmingly  funny, insidiously smooth.  </P> <P> 'A FEW DAYS WITH ME'  </P> <P> A Galaxy Films release of a Sara Films/Cinea/Films A2 production.

			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Export programme 'hitting US poor' THE CONTROVERSIAL US Export Enhancement Program - the American export subsidy scheme - has become a target of new criticism for taking bread from the mouths of American schoolchildren, the poor and the elderly so that wheat can be sold abroad at below cost-price. The stockpiles of surplus commodities in the US Department of Agriculture's warehouses have almost run out empty and the department has spent nearly all of the Dollars 120m allocated in this year's budget to buy canned goods and other foods to distribute to country's the poor. Congressman Bob Wise, chairman of a government operations subcommittee, is outraged that the agriculture department has had to cancel flour donations because of the scarcity of government-held wheat stocks. Wheat supplies are at their lowest levels since 1974. 'We have an agriculture programme that is taking away millions of lbs of flour from the poor at the same time it spends a billion dollars a year subsidising wheat exports,' the Congressman said at a recent hearing. One of his staff members said schools would be forced to raise the prices of the food they supply to pupils to compensate for the shortfall in government donations. Other commodities - like rice, honey, oats and peanut butter - are also in short supply. The USDA, however, is proud of the success of US farm policy in reducing government surpluses. Reserves have fallen from 6bn bushels in 1987 to about 1.5bn, as ofFebruary 1, 1992, and continued stock reduction is expected. A large share of US wheat has been going under the EEP to the Commonwealth of Independent States, which buys only if it gets credit. The Bush administration recently announced the provision of Dollars 600m in new credit for Russia and Dollars 110m for the Ukraine. For Russia, Dollars 300m is available immediately with Dollars 112m of that being specifically for wheat purchasing. The USDA still has large supplies of butter. This week it donated 21,000 tonnes, worth about Dollars 30m to Russia. It also made 40,000 tonnes of subsidised rice available to Algeria and donated 100,000 tonnes of maize and sorghum to Jordan.</p>

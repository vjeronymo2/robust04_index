At the invitation of the  international mediators Lord Owen and Thorwald Stoltenberg,  representatives of eight states met for a "private" conference  in Geneva, convened at short notice.    Apart from Austria's Foreign Minister Alois Mock, the  foreign  ministers of Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Greece, and Albania, and  the Hungarian deputy foreign minister attended the meeting. The  Turkish foreign minister canceled his participation at the last  minute.    Officially, only economic issues -- the impact of the  sanctions on the remaining Yugoslavia and economic  reconstruction after a peace agreement -- were on the agenda.  Yet observers in Geneva noted a deeper political background:  Owen and Stoltenberg might try to induce some neighboring  countries with closer relations with Serbia, such as Greece and  Bulgaria, to exert political pressure on Belgrade.    The meeting was dominated by the NATO consultations on a  military strike against Serbian positions in Sarajevo. Mock  vehemently supported a military intervention by the United  Nations and supported the most recent French initiative for air  strikes.    Instead of merely adopting resolutions, the world community  must effectively implement human rights, Mock stressed before  the beginning of the talks: "Power without rights leads to  tyranny, but rights without power leads to ridicule. An  aggressor simply does not take the 25th warning and the 30th  resolution of the Security Council seriously any longer."    Mock stressed the same issues in a speech to the UN Human  Rights Commission, which is currently convening in Geneva. He  welcomed the quick nomination of a UN human rights commissioner,  decided at the human rights conference in Vienna in June 1993.    During a short meeting with UN High Commissioner for  Refugees  Sadako Ogata, Mock endorsed the creation of a new relief  organization that should be jointly run by Muslims, Croats, and  Serbs.</p>

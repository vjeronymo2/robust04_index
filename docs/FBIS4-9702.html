			<p>BFN     [Text] In one of the first expressions of support in light  of the upcoming second round of elections, the presidential  candidate for the National Conciliation Party [PCN] that,  according to the vote count, came in fourth in the first round  of elections, has said that his party will support the  Nationalist Republican Alliance [ARENA].    Colonel Roberto Escobar Garcia, a lawyer and PCN secretary  general, said yesterday that his party will support ARENA in the  runoff. Even though the Supreme Electoral Tribunal has not made  an official announcement, there are indications that it will be  held on 24 April.    According to political observers, ARENA should not pursue an  alliance in confronting the left in the runoff because it has  enough strength to defeat all the leftist parties combined. They  also believe Fidel Chavez Mena does not have the leadership to  call on the rank and file to vote for ARENA.</p>

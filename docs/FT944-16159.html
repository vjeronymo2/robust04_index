			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Albert Fisher loses its taste for baked beans Albert Fisher, the food processing and distribution group, yesterday walked away from the UK's baked bean price war, which has seen supermarkets selling own-label beans for 7p a can or less. It has sold part of Stratford-upon-Avon Foods and part of Rowats Foods to Campbell Grocery Products, a subsidiary of the US food group, for Pounds 37.1m. The businesses operate from a site in Stratford which is 80 per cent devoted to canning baked beans in catering sizes, mainly for the food service sector. The site also cans fruit and vegetables and bottles pickles, mainly for own label. In the year to the end of August the businesses contributed Pounds 3.1m to pre-tax profits on turnover of Pounds 39.2m. Mr Stephen Walls, chairman, said the baked bean market had been very difficult for a couple of years, and the market for pickles had been equally tough. 'We thought the business would be far better off in the hands of a larger player in the canning sector,' he said. The disposal was in line with his strategy of concentrating on value-added, high quality products and growth markets where the group could take a leading position. The shares closed 4p ahead at 48p. The board plans to use the proceeds to continue the development of the group, but in the short term it will cut debt. Mr David Johnson, chairman, president and chief executive of Campbell Soup in the US, described the acquisition as 'strategic', opening the way for Campbell to grow in the UK by building on its core competency of heat processed foods. City analysts suggested yesterday that Fisher had got a good price for the businesses. Profits at the group - due to report its annual results next Thursday - are forecast at about Pounds 40m, excluding exceptionals.</p>

The minister who was  addressing a "forum" organized on the Congolese television, said  the return of peace in the residential districts of Brazzaville  is a precondition for holding these by-elections stipulated by  the international arbitral college.    The by-elections will be held in nine constituencies where  election results were canceled by the arbitral college. The  college reviewed 58 petitions for annulment submitted by parties  of the presidential group and the opposition after the early  elections held last May and October.    Two out of the nine affected constituencies are in  Brazzaville, one in Pointe Noire and the remaining in the  country's northern regions. The outcome of the by-elections  should not compromise the majority position held by the  presidential group at the national assembly. The presidential  group won 64 out of the 125 parliamentary seats.    In a statement on national television on 6 February, Mr.  Mberi, who is a minister of state, expressed satisfaction with  the "cease- fire agreement" concluded on 31 January by  parliamentarians from the country's four southern regions.

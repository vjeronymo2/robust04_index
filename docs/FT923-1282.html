			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Danes propose supplementary text to treaty THE Danish government yesterday proposed adding a supplementary text to the Maastricht treaty, in an attempt to overcome Danish voters' objections about the Community's democratic shortcomings. Mr Poul Schluter, the prime minister, said the government was not seeking to renegotiate the basic agreement, which the electorate rejected in a referendum in June. But the new text, to be negotiated with the other 11 members of the EC, would form a binding supplement to the treaty. The time needed to formulate the proposals, aimed at reducing centralisation and making the Community more open and democratic, could delay until next autumn a planned new Danish referendum. Denmark is proposing the text should clarify the application of subsidiarity, under which decisions should be made at the lowest practicable level of government. The government also wants more control over the European Commission, and more openess on Community legislation. A further suggestion is to open to the public meetings of the European Council. Mr Schluter stressed Denmark's proposals would address issues which are problems in other EC countries. 'It is not good enough to develop the European Community along lines which perhaps 40 or 50 per cent of our people dislike,' he said, referring to the narrow pro-Maastricht majority in Sunday's vote in France. In the planned second referendum, the government will ask Danes to vote on a set of special reservations to aspects of the treaty, Mr Schluter. These will set out Denmark's desire to hold back from participation in a common European defence, and in the final stage of economic and monetary union. He left open the legal status of the supplement.</p>

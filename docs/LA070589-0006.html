			<p><P> July 5, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS: WALESA AWARD IS A FAMILY AFFAIR  </P> <P> The celebration of America's independence took on an international accent as  Danuta Walesa, wife of Polish Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, accepted the  Philadelphia Liberty Medal on her husband's behalf while throngs of  Polish-Americans watched. Walesa, her eldest son Jaroslaw at her side, was  presented with the medal by Mayor W. Wilson Goode during Fourth of July  ceremonies at Independence Hall. Standing in front of a large copy of the medal  -- which bears an engraving of the Liberty Bell suspended between the Eastern  and Western Hemispheres -- and speaking through a translator, Walesa read a  letter from her husband. "Americans and Poles both have this need for freedom  and gave voice to this need when they drafted their constitutions over 200  years ago, but it would not have come into existence if people in our nations  had succumbed to captivity," he wrote. Lech Walesa, the first recipient of the  award, will receive $100,000 cash from Bell Atlantic, the Liberty Medal  sponsor. Also on hand was former Secretary of State Edmund S. Muskie, a  Polish-American. He praised Walesa's fight to uphold the human rights contained  in the Polish constitution.  </P> <P>  -- Some friends of activist Dick Gregory are saying yes to his anti-drug  crusade in Shreveport, La. The former comedian set up camp in a Shreveport park  known for its drug trade, declaring it a drug-free zone. Coretta Scott King  stopped by to urge those in the park to use nonviolence to fight drugs as her  husband had used nonviolence to fight for civil rights. "There is a power in  nonviolence," she said. "We don't expect it to be solved overnight. When the  people of America speak with one voice and say, 'This is enough,' we'll do  something about the problem." Her son, Martin Luther King III, also is  scheduled to stop in Shreveport to help Gregory's crusade, and actor Ben Vereen  joined Gregory over the weekend.  </P> <P>  -- It will be an expensive date but not a very private one. A Dallas woman who  bid $13,600 to go on a charity date with Jean LeClerc, who plays Jeremy Hunter  on the soap opera "All My Children," is taking along a chaperon -- Dallas  Cystic Fibrosis poster child Mika Doyle. "I thought that was one of the nicest  gestures I've ever seen," said Regen Horchow Pillsbury, who was one of the  organizers of the Cystic Fibrosis Bachelor Bid last week in Dallas. Jan Rogers'  donation won her a trip to New York for lunch with LeClerc at Tavern on the  Green and a ringside seat at a taping session of his TV show. SHIRLEY MARLOW  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir said press freedom does not  mean that people can tell lies and if the Britain press take the  liberty of telling lies, they must be ready to face the  consequences. Speaking at a [name indistinct] interview program  aired by the British (?ITV) network today, the prime minister  said Malaysia's decision to ban British companies from getting  new business contracts may be reviewed but such a decision is  not within his authority.    Malaysia imposed the ban following British media reports  saying Malaysian Government leaders received kickbacks from  British companies. The ban, which also annulled all business  agreements, caused British companies to lose billions of ringgit.    Speaking at a news conference at the end of his visit to  Sabah, Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir said the federal government had no  intention of pressuring the Sabah state government when it made  its decision to rotate the chief minister's post among the three  main ethnic groups. The move is purely designed to prevent  undesirable actions by some people. [Mahathir's recording  indistinct]    Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir also talked about tourism in Sabah.</p>

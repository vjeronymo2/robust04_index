			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Gains cut back as currency worries resurface - Market Report A continuation of the technical rally in the UK stock market was reined in towards the close of trading yesterday by weakness in US bonds and equities. The gain in the FT-SE 100-share Index was halved in the second half of the session, and the closing minutes of dealing saw the futures contract on the index fall to a discount against the cash market. The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,909 for a net gain of 9.1 points after an erratic day's trading. With the US dollar holding steady overnight above the Y100 figure, UK equities opened sharply higher, the Footsie adding 27 points despite a somewhat cautious opening in stock index futures. The Footsie gain was cut back very quickly to only 6.5 points as traders waited for the announcement of the latest UK Treasury economic forecasts. Share prices responded well to the upgrading of official gdp growth forecasts for this year to 2.75 per cent, coupled with a prediction by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, that domestic inflation would remain subdued at 2.5 per cent for the next two years. Backed up by at least two sizeable trading programmes, the Footsie moved upwards again, re-establishing a net gain of more than 20 points. But confidence began to falter when US bonds opened lower on news of a 1.1 per cent gain in US import prices in the latest month, together with a strong consumer confidence index. The US currency came under renewed pressure, raising all the market's fears that the Federal Reserve might have to push US interest rates higher. UK stocks came off the top quite quickly as British government bonds extended earlier losses, the Dow Average fell 30 points and the US dollar dipped below Y100. London market traders said that volatility in share prices and increased trading reflected some hectic position squaring ahead of the end of the second trading quarter of 1994 which closes on Thursday. Some fund managers are believed to prefer to show high cash balances at the end of the quarter. Traders also pointed out that on Monday, when the market turned in a very volatile performance, genuine retail or customer business was worth a mere Pounds 624.2m, one of the lowest daily totals this year. Trading volume, as measured by the catch-all Seaq-recorded total increased sharply yesterday, with the 729.3m share total nearly double Monday's figure. This bore out evidence on the trading screens of large programme trades, which in turn prompted arbitraging between cash and futures markets. Around 62 per cent of yesterday's business was in non-Footsie 100 stocks. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, largely unrelated to futures trading, gained 20.8 to 3,384.2. There was some disappointment that London had failed to follow other European bourses in holding steady yesterday afternoon, in spite of the weakness in New York markets. The favourable news on UK economic growth and inflation clearly pleased equities, before their vulnerability to developments in foreign exchange markets made their impact. UK markets had little time yesterday afternoon to make a considered response to the signs of renewed pressure on the dollar and equity traders will be watching New York currency trading closely for clues to the likely mood of the London markets when they open for business this morning.</p>

			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / Arts: Montserrat Caballe - Recital After the success of last year's 'Music for Life' day on the South Bank, the Aids fundraising body Crusaid organised another such jamboree last Sunday. Throughout the morning and afternoon musicians were doing their thing on a voluntary basis: many and varied things, including Judith Weir's mini-opera The Small Moments (In Life) in the Royal Festival Hall ballroom, a performance in the Elizabeth Hall by an ensemble of six pianos (Piano Circus), and a staging in the Festival Hall by the Finchley Children's Music Group of Britten's church opera Noyes Fludde. The day had a glowing gala resolution in the form of an evening recital by Montserrat Caballe and her fine pianist Manuel Burgueras at the Royal Opera House. The soprano was a friend and unlikely artistic partner of the late Freddie Mercury; thus her contribution to Aids fundraising here and elsewhere has personal poignancy. She offered one of her familiar chronological (or near enough) programmes, starting in High Baroque, ending in the demotic style of the zarzuela, and the whole sequence laced with theatricality and camp appeal. Her three Vivaldi arias immediately assured us that the voice was in powerful shape, as doughtily heroic as meticulously controlled; grandly assertive and, if never exactly delicate, capable of wonderfully precise focus. The wife's complaint 'Sposa, son disprezza' (from Bajazet) had passionate purity of line as well as pure passion of utterance. Caballe is to lead the Royal Opera's new production of Rossini's Il viaggio a Reims in July (celebrating the 20th anniversary of her house debut), and her Sunday selection of Rossiniana displayed her characteristic gift, not much dimmed by age, for hard coloratura brilliance and the ringing, knowing top. She has never perhaps been the most beguiling and simply seductive of singers, and one missed the note of unaffected sentiment in her Massenet songs and, more surprisingly, the touching Andalucian intensity of Turina's 'Cancion de cuna'. Sometimes one felt that delicacy and pathos for Ms Caballe are mere diminution of force rather than mettlesome qualities in their own right. But she made the subtle patter of the zarzuela song, 'Marinela', absolutely captivating, and as an encore rendered Puccini's brief 'O mio bambino caro' with plausible pathos if not first freshness. She turned a longer Massenet encore into a finale of astonishing stamina and flair. One more encore, then the house came tumbling down, and everyone rose to his feet.</p>

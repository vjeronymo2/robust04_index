			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Sikh militants, who pledged to avenge the execution of two Sikhs in the  assassination of former Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, killed 14 Hindus  in two attacks in the northern state of Punjab. Gunmen shot dead 10 farmhands  in one attack and killed four workers at a brick kiln in the second attack. A  note left at one of the sites said it was the first revenge for the deaths of  Satwant Singh and Kehar Singh, who were hanged Friday for their roles in the  1984 killing of Gandhi by her Sikh bodyguards.  </P></p>

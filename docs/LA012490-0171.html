			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> WHY SENIORS TOUR? NICKLAUS, 50, PONDERS;  </P> <P> GOLF: 'NO MATTER WHAT I AM, I'M A GOLFER FIRST. I LOVE COMPETITION MORE THAN  ANYTHING I DO. I GET REALLY CHARGED UP. IT'S THE EGO FACTOR. . . .'  </P> <P> As golf legend Jack Nicklaus undergoes the transformation from Golden Bear to  Golden Oldie, he is struck by a difficult question.  </P> <P> What does he gain by playing on the Seniors Tour, which is filled with players  he regularly defeated but are now loaded for bear? Nicklaus, who turned 50  Sunday, will compete in his first seniors tournament this weekend, the $450,000  Seniors Skins Game in Hawaii. Arnold Palmer, Lee Trevino and Gary Player are in  the field.  </P> <P> "That's a good question," Nicklaus said. "I suppose there are two or three  things that would fall into that category. No matter what I am, I'm a golfer  first. I love competition more than anything I do. I get really charged up.  It's the ego factor that I'll go out (on the tour). That's what kept me out  after I won the Masters (in 1986), figuring lightning might strike again."  </P> <P> But lightning hasn't struck since, though Nicklaus doggedly insists he still  belongs on the regular PGA Tour. He will test that resolve extensively in the  next few months. Commitments to 30 under-construction golf courses will take  him back to the business world in June.  </P> <P> "Financially is certainly not the reason I'm playing," said Nicklaus. His  Golden Bear conglomerate reportedly makes up to $400 million a year.  </P> <P> "Golf has ceased to be my way of making my living for the last 15 years. I  think the majority of golfing people are looking forward to me and Trevino and  others coming out. I think I would be kicking them in the face if I didn't do  that."  </P> <P> But he would be admitting defeat if he fled the regular tour. He isn't ready to  do that. He may never be. If he thought like that, he might have changed  direction in 1980. He became 40, a more traumatic milestone than 50, he says.  He was also coming off what he called a terrible year. At 39, he won a mere  $59,434 after winning at least $244,000 the previous eight seasons.  </P> <P> He dealt with the disappointment and rallied boldly to win the 1980 U.S. Open  and the PGA Championship.  </P> <P> For much of the 1980s, as business became so many sand traps and back problems  hindered his backswing, his attention turned from golf. Playing an abbreviated  schedule last year, he won $96,595. His best showings came where his best  showings have always come -- in majors. He has won 20 in his career.  </P> <P> This year, he says, is the first since he was 40 that he has set concrete golf  goals -- winning a tournament on each tour.  </P> <P> "I have not decided in my own mind that I can't play on the regular tour. If  you look at the majors (last year), which are the ones I really get ready for,  only about five American golfers beat me.  </P> <P> "When I tee it up, I play it as a game. It doesn't make any difference whether  it's for 10 cents or a million dollars. You go out, pull the club back and see  if you can do it better than anyone else. But I just can't do it as well as I  used to. I want to be competitive. I don't want to go out there and embarrass  myself."  </P> <P> Nicklaus has been characterized as someone who, when he reaches the top of a  mountain, immediately starts looking for another mountain. He longs to regain  that passion.  </P> <P> "I haven't looked for many of those mountains for about 10 years. That's been a  problem for me. I suppose this year, the one thing that has happened is I'm  physically better than I've been in the past few years. My back has been very  good. I've been able to do some of the things I want to do, running, lifting  weights. I'm in pretty darn good shape for someone my age, even for someone  younger.  </P> <P> "Now I can go out and play and practice earlier. It's exciting. It's fun."  </P> <P> Nicklaus may be learning that life begins at 50.  </P> <P> "Now that I'm 50, there is nothing I can do about it. And I'm happy to be  there, incidentally."  </P></p>

			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): One man's revolution  -Reform of the media buying system has left France's advertising industry in chaos Michel Sapin, the former socialist finance minister who is now a founder member of the Bank of France's monetary policy council, is generally regarded as one of the more staid members of the fiery French political scene. Yet Sapin gave his name to one of the socialists' most controversial pieces of legislation: le loi Sapin, the sweeping reforms of the French media buying system which were introduced almost a year ago and have since caused chaos in the country's advertising industry. Le loi Sapin has, as the socialists intended, revolutionised the way that media space is bought and sold in France by ensuring that the advertisers pay for it directly rather than through intermediaries such as media buying specialists or advertising agencies. But it has also imposed intense financial pressure on the advertising industry and on some sectors of the media, notably newspapers and magazines, at a time when they are already struggling in the recession. 'What le loi Sapin has done is to reverse the balance of power in French advertising,' says Neil Blackley, European media analyst at Goldman Sachs. 'The pendulum has swung against the agencies and media buyers back to the advertisers.' Advertising executives condemn the law but their clients seem delighted. 'We don't just think it's a good thing, we think it's excellent,' says Alain Grange-Cabane, deputy chairman of the French advertisers' association. 'When we polled our members to see whether they approved of the new system overall  -95 per cent said 'yes'.' Under the old media buying system media space was bought for the advertisers by their intermediaries. The advertisers paid them the full price for the space as specified on the media owners' rate card and the intermediaries kept any discounts negotiated from the media owners. But, because the intermediaries negotiated discounts for all their clients, individual advertisers did not know exactly how much their own space was worth. The system also favoured the biggest buyers. The chief beneficiary was Carat which expanded to account for more than a quarter of all media buying. Under le loi Sapin advertisers pay directly for their own media. Details of each transaction are clearly visible and advertisers are allowed to keep their own discounts. In short, le loi Sapin has introduced the same system of media buying to France that already existed in most other European countries and the US. The intermediaries should be able to compensate for the loss of their old discounts by charging fees or commission for planning and executing their clients' media buying schedules. But in practice the intermediaries have found this difficult. 'Most French advertisers got free media buying under the old system,' says Rebecca Winnington-Ingram, European media analyst at Morgan Stanley. 'Unsurprisingly, agencies and media buyers have found it hard to persuade them to pay for something that they're used to getting for nothing.' The problem is most acute for the big media buyers, notably Carat, which were used to making substantial sums of money by wholesaling media space to their clients. Aegis, the marketing services group that owns Carat, last autumn announced a substantial financial restructuring programme, chiefly because of the impact of le loi Sapin. France's larger advertising agencies are also suffering as media buying used to be one of the most profitable areas of their business. The French advertising agency association estimates that the gross profits of its 200 members fell by 10 per cent to FFr7.27bn (Pounds 830m) last year. 'It's impossible to identify how much of the reduction in profits is due to the recession and how much to le loi Sapin,' says Philippe Legendre, head of research. 'But I'd guess that it's half and half.' The industry is showing signs of strain. The level of employment among the association's members fell by 8 per cent to 9,260 last year. TBWA, one of the largest French agencies, last year lost its independence to be taken over by Omnicom of the US: as did FCA which was absorbed by France's Publicis. The French press has also been destabilised by le loi Sapin. National newspapers have lost 27 per cent of their advertising revenue in the past two years, according to industry estimates. This is partly because le loi Sapin has accelerated the long-term trend for advertisers to concentrate their expenditure on the most powerful media, such as television and radio.</p>

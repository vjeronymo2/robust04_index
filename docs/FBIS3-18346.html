			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dick Spring, Irish deputy prime minister and </F> foreign minister, by Laurent Zecchini; place and date not given:  "We Are Highly Dedicated Europeans"]    [Text] Irish Vice Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Dick  Spring is the leader of the [Irish] Labor Party (the left wing  of the coalition in power in Dublin). The interview he gave us  covered his country's place in Europe.    [Zecchini] In terms of its exports, Ireland will benefit  from  the GATT agreement, but it will lose out on agriculture,  following the reduction of farming subsidies. Are you satisfied  all the same?    [Spring] Indeed, our economy is highly focused on exports,  but our agriculture is also well protected by the commitments  undertaken at the most recent Community meetings. If there is  an imbalance regarding the Common Agricultural Policy [CAP]  within the context of GATT, it is the European Council that will  have to review the question of compensations. In any case, we  will have to wait several years to see just how compatible the  terms of the reformed CAP are with the rules agreed under GATT.    [Zecchini] Ireland has always managed to obtain substantial  structural funds, but are these not short-term victories, to the  extent that you have an economy that is increasingly dependent  on financial support?    [Spring] There are different ways of looking at things. What  we are trying to do within the Community is achieve a kind of  balance regarding our various economic situations. We entered  the EC with a standard of living of about 66 percent of the  Community-wide average. Today, we have attained a level of 70  percent, so we are making progress. Clearly, it would not be in  our interest to belong to a Community which merely served the  interests of the richest countries. A large proportion of the  structural funds are being spent on developing our  infrastructures and educational system. This will enable us to  heighten our competitiveness and have an economy which is  increasingly compatible with that of our partners.    [Zecchini] One day the Community could decide that some  countries in Eastern Europe are in greater need of Community  funds than Ireland.    [Spring] That is a question of balance. We are extremely  aware that the development of the countries in Central Europe  will become a decisive factor regarding the security and  stability of all of Europe. However, there are both advantages  and disadvantages linked with this new situation: Even if our  financial assistance is reduced, we will at the same time have  access to new markets.    [Zecchini] The Irish are considered to be "good Europeans,"  but that does not prevent you from buying Boeing aircraft  instead of Airbus, and of equipping your police force with  Japanese motorcycles. Could you be pragmatic Europeans?    [Spring] We are highly dedicated Europeans. We want to buy  in Europe as much as possible. Moreover, there are major  opportunities for our own products that we have not yet  exploited, namely on the French, Italian, and German markets.  Although many of our traditional industries suffered when we  joined the EC, we want to play our role in developing Europe.  Although the criteria enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty are  imposing very tight constraints on our economy, ironically  enough today we are closer to fulfilling those criteria than  many other countries which are strongly in favor of them. Mark  my words, the Irish will continue to be good, solid Europeans.  It is in all our interests -- especially bearing Russian  instability in mind -- that Europe should continue to develop,  with the small countries continuing to exert their influence, as  we have been doing since 1973.</p>

			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Pensions: a tough Italian job - Berlusconi needs to reform the system in the teeth of trade union opposition After a hectic car chase through the outskirts of Turin, police arrested a man suspected of armed robbery. An identity check revealed he was registered as an invalid and drawing a pension. This incident 10 days ago illustrates one of the worst areas of abuse in Italy's bloated state pensions system. Almost one in three of the 21m pensions paid out annually goes to invalids, a proportion without equal in Europe. Everyone knows many such 'invalids' are bogus. In southern Italy local politicians recognise invalidity pensions as the simplest way of providing long-term unemployment benefit. As the Italian government wrestles with a reform of the pensions system, it and the other interested parties now agree that fiddles like this should end. The trouble is that they agree on very little else. Curbing Italy's generous and incredibly complex state pensions system has become a crucial test of the Berlusconi government's political and financial credibility. Cuts in pension benefits are supposed to be the centrepiece of the 1995 budget, now in the final stages of preparation. They are the benchmark by which sceptical financial markets will judge the rightwing coalition's ability to tackle Italy's debt-ridden public finances. At the heart of the problem is the growing gap between pension contributions and pensions payments which in Italy's 'pay as you go' system is met by the government. Pensions absorb over 40 per cent of the state budget; this year the gap between contributions and the amount needed for pension payments is L84,000bn - equivalent to half the total budget deficit. Effective reform of the pensions system would stand a strong chance of halting the inexorable increase in the budget deficit. Without it, on current trends the deficit will reach close to L185,000bn in 1995, equivalent to more than 12 per cent of gross domestic product. That would spell a further rise in Italy's public sector debt - already at the dangerous level of 125 per cent of GDP. Such reform, however, looks like being difficult to achieve. Mr Silvio Berlusconi, prime minister, faces intense opposition from trade unions, which are anxious to defend existing pension benefits and are threatening a general strike over the issue. He has made clear he does not wish to antagonise them, and on Monday for the second time in a week postponed a 'definitive' negotiating session. This is now due to take place tomorrow. What is more, the government is weak and is itself divided over pensions reform. The treasury under Mr Lamberto Dini talks tough, well aware that unless the forthcoming budget shows tangible progress on the pensions issue, the consequences will be immediately felt in the exchange rate of the lira and the yield on Italian government bonds. The labour ministry, on the other hand, champions the interests of the unions, in the process undermining the treasury. The explanation for Italy's growing pensions gap is not that individual pensions are generous - the average pension is around L1m a month. Rather the system is poorly structured and administered and pays too many unnecessary pensions. Compared with other European countries (see chart) the retirement age is low, and pensions tend to be higher as a proportion of final salary. There is little or no incentive at present for the growth of a private pensions industry. As important is the complex nature of the pension system. The treasury says 17 different systems are applied to salaried workers, three more for the self-employed and 11 for the professions. Each category enjoys a different set of privileges. Some, such as agricultural workers, pay in minimal contributions. Journalists, doctors and even Italy's 3,000 customs agents pay into separate state-run schemes. The privileges for public sector employees are especially extravagant. Women can retire after a mere 15 years work on 80 per cent of final salary. Men can get away with 20 years' work. Others like teachers can retire, take another job, and take their pension only on full retirement. The pension they then draw will still reflect the automatic seniority pay increases due to teachers every two years. The government of Mr Giuliano Amato made an attempt at pension reform in 1992. It froze indexation of pensions to inflation and provided for a gradual increase in the retirement age from 60 to 65 for men and 55 to 60 for women, to be complete by 2002. However, this has proved less than adequate in the face of the constant pressure on the budget from debt service costs. What is more, talk of the need for further cuts has triggered a flood of requests for early retirement from public sector employees: of the 459,000 pension requests between January-August, 340,000 are for early retirement. Pressure on Mr Berlusconi to act on pensions has been increased by his determination to avoid tax increases, which leaves him reliant mainly on spending cuts to bring the overall budget deficit to below 8 per cent of GDP. The prime minister's hands are tied by tax-cutting election promises, and he is looking for extra budget revenues to one-off devices dreamed up by Mr Giulio Tremonti, the finance minister: an amnesty on illegal building - yielding otherwise lost building registration taxes - and a partial waiver of Italy's 1.3m contested tax assessments. Such measures have deepened the scepticism among foreign observers about Italy's public finances. Remarked one market analyst: 'We are always weary of one-off measures like these pardons which in the case of Italy have a poor record of providing the funds promised.' The government wants to make three basic changes to the pensions system to bring Italy more into line with the rest of the European Union. It wants to: simplify the system, end anomalies and bring contributions into line with payments; accelerate the increase in the retirement age - currently 56 for women and 61 for men - from one year every two years to one year every 18 months, and increase the pension contributions period; change the rate at which pension provisions accrue from the current 2 per cent a year, well above the EU average, to 1.75 per cent a year. All sides - government and unions - agree on the need to end the difference between the treatment of private sector employees and the more favourable position of those in the public sector. There is also unanimity on the importance of shifting more of the burden on to the individual by fostering the growth of private pension funds. Thereafter agreement evaporates. The unions oppose the government's plan to raise the retirement age. They are against the idea of extending the contribution period, and say they will block the plan to alter the accrual rate. Matters have been complicated by the failure of a cross-party commission set up to make recommendations on the pension issue to reach a consensus. Mr Berlusconi approved the establishment of the 18-person commission in early August hoping its academics, trade unionists and politicians would come up with a platform that could be sold as 'neutral' to all concerned. The proposals, finalised on Monday, were effectively split into two separate reports, with agreement on only a few broad concepts. Last week union leaders won a concession from Mr Berlusconi. Instead of seeking a specific sum in benefit cuts - the treasury wants some L8,000bn - the prime minister agreed to consider overhauling the structure of pensions first. Almost inevitably, that will mean a smaller saving in the 1995 budget. Time is running out for agreement. The budget has to be submitted to parliament in detail before the end of the month. On Monday, Mr Berlusconi adopted a tougher tone: 'The existing pensions system cannot work and if we go on like this the state will not be able to pay pensions in the future.' But the prime minister's previous behaviour suggests that, faced with the choice of mollifying the unions or appeasing the financial markets, he will back away from a domestic confrontation.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- ITALY'S PENSIONS: THE HIGH COST OF A SAFE RETIREMENT How Rome compares ..  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                           Italy         Germany     France          UK  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Pensionable age      61/56 private        65/65      66/65       65/60 Male/female           65/65 public Basis of             Last 5 years       Working    Best 10     Working calculation          with gradual rises    life      years        life Minimum pension            16               5          10       1/4 of service (years)                                           working life Minimum contribution       40              40        37.5           50 period Maximum pension            80%             60%         50%         20% as % of salary Indexation              Prices         National   National    National                                         average    average     average                                        earnings   earnings    earnings  --------------------------------------------------------------------- THE BIG HOLE: IMBALANCE IN CONTRIBUTIONS/PAYMENTS BY SALARIED WORKERS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                  Private Sector                   Public Sector  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Lire  Pension      Worker's Difference Pension     Worker's Difference bn   payments contributions           payments contributions  --------------------------------------------------------------------- 1995  124,636        75,074    -49,562  56,377       35,961    -20,416 2000  131,234        82,150    -49,084  67,621       37,761    -29,860 2005  145,013        86,274    -58,739  74,078       39,687    -34,391 2010  169,707        89,270    -80,437  82,881       41,712    -41,169  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                             Total  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Lire       Pension          Worker's            Difference bn        payments       contributions  --------------------------------------------------------------------- 1995       181,013             111,035             -69,978 2000       198,855             119,911             -78,944 2005       219,091             135,995             -83,096 2010       252,588             130,982            -121,606  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

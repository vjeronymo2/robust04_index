			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> ATKINSON IS READY TO TAKE STEP TOWARD A NATIONAL CROWN;  </P> <P> TRACK: FORMER MIRA COSTA HIGH RUNNER BATTLES BACK FROM INJURY TO COMPETE FOR  TAC 1,500-METER TITLE.  </P> <P> Jeff Atkinson is back in town this weekend to compete in The Athletics Congress  Track and Field Championships at Cerritos College and the 27-year-old can't  wait to take a jog on his old training route, the Strand in Manhattan Beach.  </P> <P> Perhaps a dose of hometown, ocean air can help the Mira Costa High graduate win  his first TAC national 1,500-meter title, but the 1988 Olympian and Stanford  All-American willhave to overcome two big obstacles.  </P> <P> The first is an ankle injury that has hampered his training all year. The  second is that he will compete against a tough field at Cerritos, including  veteran miler Steve Scott and two-time NCAA champion Joe Falcon.  </P> <P> All three men are expected to cruise through Friday night's preliminary heat  and advance to Saturday's final at 8:25 p.m. The top two finishers will go to  the Goodwill Games in Seattle July 23-26.  </P> <P> "Up to four weeks ago he told me he was definitely going to be in Seattle so I  already bought tickets for the family for Seattle," said Atkinson's father,  Willie Atkinson, who lives in Manhattan Beach.  </P> <P> Last year Atkinson was the TAC's top-ranked miler, Falcon was No. 2 and Scott  No. 3. This year's rankings won't be released until the end of the year, after  all major competition is completed, but Atkinson believes Falcon has taken over  as the top-ranked miler.  </P> <P> Falcon, 24, was the 1988 NCAA 1,500 champion and the 1987 NCAA 10,000 champion.  </P> <P> Scott, 34, was the country's premier miler in the 1980s. He's won the TAC 1,500  title six times and has been ranked in the top 10 since 1976.  </P> <P> Atkinson is confident of a good finish despite the injury and strong  competition. In November of 1989, he tore ligaments in his left ankle after  stepping on a rock while running in Los Altos, where he lives and trains.  </P> <P> He shares a large house called "The Training Manor" with indoor 800 champion  Ray Brown, steeplechaser Dave Frank and TAC 10-kilometer road champion Harry  Green, a former All-American at the University of Texas.  </P> <P> "It took me three months to get back into running condition," Atkinson said.  "I've been unable to train properly and I don't think I'll be as prepared as I  have been in the past. But I like to run well when it counts. . . . Of course  I'll be trying to win the race. I always do. I've done this nationals thing so  many times."  </P> <P> Brooks Johnson, Atkinson's coach since college, thinks the runner has recovered  physically from the injury, but has yet to recover emotionally.  </P> <P> "The injury was debilitating for a while physically, but the real scar is what  it's done to his psyche," said Johnson, the cross country coach at Stanford.  </P> <P> Even injury-free, Atkinson has never won a big title. During his junior year at  Stanford, he placed third in the 1,500 at the Pacific 10 Conference meet and  seventh at the NCAA championships in Texas.  </P> <P> As a senior in 1986, he placed fourth in the 1,500 at the NCAA championships in  Indianapolis. He was also the captain of Stanford's Pac-10 champion cross  country team.  </P> <P> "He was more or less a Southern California beach boy and he ended up being an  All-American," said Johnson, who has coached at Stanford since 1979. "That's a  pretty radical transition and transformation and he did it all himself."  </P> <P> Last year in Houston, Atkinson had his best TAC national finish. He placed  second to Clemson's Terrance Herrington in the 1,500. Before that his best TAC  national performance was in 1986, when he placed fourth in Eugene, Ore.  </P> <P> Atkinson won his only medal, a bronze, at the 1989 World Indoor Championships  in Budapest with an indoor personal best of 3:38.12. In 1988, he won the 1,500  at the Olympic trials in Indianapolis and he reached the final at the Seoul  Olympics.  </P> <P> At Seoul, Atkinson led the pack until the last lap, but faded and finished  10th.  </P> <P> "My strategy is to get in kicking position with 600 meters to go," Atkinson  said. "But I just got too tired. I went out too quick and got passed down the  stretch."  </P> <P> The 6-foot-1, 160-pound Atkinson said he considers the Olympics the highlight  of his career.  </P> <P> "I was pretty satisfied," he said. "After all, you go to the Olympics for the  first time and you make it to the finals you got to be pretty psyched."  </P> <P> Willie Atkinson, who accompanied his son to Seoul, said reaching the final  overshadowed the disappointment of not winning a medal. Willie was a 1947  indoor middle-distance champion at New York's Manhattan College.  </P> <P> "He was ecstatic just to be there," he said. "He was overjoyed even though he  knew he was going to make the team. He's always been very confident.  </P> <P> "At the (1988) trials I figured he had a one-in-four chance of even making  third. I had no idea he would beat Steve Scott. We were all very surprised."  </P> <P> It was a huge improvement from the 1984 Olympic trials at the Los Angeles  Coliseum, where Atkinson was eliminated in a first-round heat. Twenty athletes  advanced to the semifinals and Atkinson placed 21st.  </P> <P> "My goal there was to make it to the final, but I still had a lot of fun out  there," he said. "It was exciting just to be there."  </P> <P> Atkinson is directing his energies toward the 1992 season with hopes of winning  a medal at the Barcelona Olympics.  </P> <P> "If you haven't noticed already, I make very slow and steady progress," he  said, laughing. "It's geared toward longevity in the sport."  </P> <P> Those who remember Atkinson as a skinny distance runner at Mira Costa might not  believe what he has already accomplished.  </P> <P> He turned to running because he wasn't big or strong enough to compete in his  favorite sports, basketball and baseball.  </P> <P> "He was under 100 pounds and a little over five feet as a freshman," Mira Costa  cross country Coach Dave Holland said. "He didn't start to blossom until the  end of his junior year."  </P> <P> But he was dedicated and determined. At 14, Atkinson finished the Mission Bay  Marathon in San Diego in 3 hours, 19 minutes. He also won the Ocean League  two-mile title as a junior and he qualified for the national high school cross  country meet as a senior.  </P> <P> "I was an average run-of-the-mill guy," he said. "I was not a superstar by any  means."  </P> <P> Atkinson graduated from Mira Costa in 1981, and Holland said he never imagined  the hard-working, gangly kid would become a collegiate All-American or an  Olympian.  </P> <P> "He was a scrappy kid with total focus on what he was doing," Holland said. "He  would take this beat-up old plastic fishing kit box and carry all his stuff in  it. He had a spare set of spikes and a tooth brush to clean his spikes.  </P> <P> "It was funny because he didn't even do very well. It was like 'why are you  taking this so seriously when you're running the way you are?' It's like he  always knew he would run with the big boys some day."  </P> <P> When he graduated from Mira Costa, Atkinson was 5-11. Despite improved  performances and his growth, no college showed interest in him. He walked on at  Stanford, competed in cross country and track and became a two-time  All-American. He also got a degree in biology.  </P> <P> "He always had a dream and he was willing to do what he thought was necessary  to fulfill it," Johnson said. "He's an intelligent worker and he works hard  when he needs to."  </P> <P> When he's done competing, Atkinson wants to move back to Manhattan Beach and be  a filmmaker. He's already done a 23-minute documentary on the Stanford cross  country team and in 1988 he did a 3 1/2-minute film on life in the Olympic  Village.  </P></p>

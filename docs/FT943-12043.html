			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Stagecoach shows 46% advance - Acquisitions bolster outcome / Pounds 33m spent on new vehicles Stagecoach Holdings, the acquisitive Perth-based bus operator, achieved a 46 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 12.9m to Pounds 18.9m in the 12 months ended April 30, its first year as a listed company. Turnover rose by 24 per cent to Pounds 191m, helped in part by contributions from the three bus companies acquired in the course of the year - East Kent, Grimsby-Cleethorpes and Western Travel. Stagecoach also spent Pounds 33m, mainly to renew its vehicle fleet. More than 650 new buses have been bought in the past three years and a further 680 are on order. The improvement in Stagecoach's figures resulted from spending on new vehicles, which reduced maintenance costs; an increase in the number of passengers carried; and the introduction of new services such as limited-stop inter-urban routes. Stagecoach also managed to integrate its new acquisitions more rapidly than anticipated, largely because they already operated efficient networks of routes, Mr Brian Souter, executive chairman, said. When two other acquisitions completed after the year end - of Western Scottish Holdings and Busways - and the proposed purchase of a 20 per cent stake in Mainline Partnership are taken into account, Stagecoach has an annualised turnover of Pounds 275m. Stagecoach made bids for all 10 of the London Bus companies which are up for sale and has been short-listed for eight, though the rules governing the sale would allow it to buy only two or three. Mr Souter said he did not think the London companies would attain the same large goodwill premiums as some of the provincial bus companies which have been sold because the London bus market has not been deregulated. Stagecoach has picked up some business as a result of the train dispute, but at the same time has lost passengers on routes which connect with British Rail. The company has 'not lost interest' in the idea of bidding for BR franchises when the train operating companies are sold off, Mr Souter said. Earnings per share rose from 8.3p to 10.3p and the company proposes a final dividend of 2.6p compared with the 2.5p forecast at the interim stage. The total distribution for the year is 4.1p. COMMENT Stagecoach has been moving so fast since it obtained a listing 15 months ago that it has been difficult to keep up with its progress. Followers of the company will be relieved therefore to hear that the businesses which were on board before the float have also shown strong growth. Their operating profits rose by Pounds 2m while new acquisitions contributed a net Pounds 2.5m after redundancy costs of Pounds 900,000. Stagecoach has been able to buck the industry-wide trend of declining passenger numbers with the help of new high-quality inter-urban services and an active marketing campaign. The rail strikes, meanwhile, can only act as a further boost to bus and coach travel. Mr Souter now plans to expand into London. He hopes the London Bus companies will not demand the giddy buyers' premiums which have become the norm in the provinces. He may be disappointed.</p>

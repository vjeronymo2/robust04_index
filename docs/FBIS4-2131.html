			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Yan Liqiang (0917 0500 1730): "Chen Xitong Conducts </F> Investigation and Study Activities in the Municipal Nonferrous  Metal Industrial Corporation and Xinyue Copper Tube Plant"]    [Excerpts] On 25 March, Chen Xitong, secretary of the  municipal party committee, went to the municipal nonferrous  metal industrial corporation and its subordinate Xinyue copper  tube plant to investigate and study deficit-halting measures for  the money-losing enterprises. He stressed: In a sense, halting  deficits means maintaining stability. So, we should adopt real  means to treat the problems by looking into both its root cause  and symptoms, expand the dynamics of the deficit-halting work,  and accelerate the pace of halting deficits.    Participating in the investigation and study activities were  Wang Baosen, executive vice mayor of the municipality; Duan  Bingren, member of the standing committee of the municipal party  committee; Li Runwu, vice mayor of the municipality; and leaders  of the relevant committees, offices, bureaus, banks, and  Changping County.    The nonferrous metal industrial corporation is the largest  money-losing enterprise of the municipal industrial front. To  help the municipality's money-losing enterprises halt deficits,  Chen Xitong established contacts with the nonferrous metal trade  on a contracted basis and began his investigations first from  Xinyue copper tube plant. On 25 March, Chen Xitong and his  party inspected the workshops of the plant, held talks with the  workers, and gained an understanding of the production and  management situation. After that, he heard the reports by the  corporation and plant leaders. [passage omitted]    Chen Xitong stressed in his speech: Beijing should submit  its work to and serve the overall situation of "grasping  favorable opportunities, deepening reform, expanding the scale  of opening up, promoting development, and maintaining stability"  as required by the central authorities; and correctly understand  and handle the relationship of reform, development, and  stability. At present, the municipality has a large number of  money-losing enterprises. This tendency, if continues, will  affect stability. In a sense, grasping deficit-halting work  means maintaining stability. We must pay high attention to  this, expand the dynamics of the work, and make real measures  and opinions. In halting deficits, enterprises should treat the  problems by looking into both their root causes and symptoms.  That is, the workers of the enterprises whose production is  totally or partially suspended should have work to do. By so  doing, temporary problems will be solved. This means helping  meet an urgent need. Simultaneously, we should exert great  efforts to enable money-losing enterprises not only to halt  deficits but also to be prosperous and well developed. There  must be a process of eliminating "poverty." Fundamentally  speaking, we should rely on reform to halt deficits. On the  premise of increasing economic results, we should first rely on  markets. We should eliminate the viewpoints of planned economy,  readjust structures according to market demands, popularize the  reform experiences gained by the first light industrial bureau,  and use the favorable opportunities of setting up the market  economic system to optimize the distribution of production  factors, including the optimum organization of personnel. It is  also necessary to carry out various methods, including the  shareholding system, the joint investment system, the system of  state ownership and civilian management, and the bankruptcy  method. The key to carrying out these methods is to emancipate  the mind, to firmly grasp favorable opportunities, to proceed  from the actual conditions of Beijing, to expand the dynamics,  and to accelerate the pace.    Chen Xitong also urged plant directors and secretaries of  the  money-losing enterprises to be inspired with enthusiasm and to  unite with the broad masses of staff members and workers to  spare no efforts and strive to "reduce deficits, strike a  balance, make slight profits, and make development." On the  premise of developing production and increasing economic  results, we should increase the income of the staff and workers  so that the staff and workers will have expectations and be  inspired with enthusiasm. Enterprises should strengthen  internal management and gain internal potential. We should  positively use foreign capital and strive to enter the  international market.    In his speech, Wang Baosen urged overall departments to  proceed from stabilizing the overall situation to positively  help money-losing enterprises halt deficits and increase  profits. Meanwhile, money-losing enterprises should develop  products with good economic results and process the materials  provided by foreign countries.    Duan Bingren urged in his speech that the money-losing  enterprises make good use of their limited funds, rely on their  own forces, pool the wisdom and efforts of their staff and  workers, and strive to tide over the difficulties.</p>

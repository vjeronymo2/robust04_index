			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: REORGANIZATION OF SCHOOL BUSING PROGRAM  APPROVED  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Unified School District board has voted 6 to 1 to reorganize  its program for busing students to relieve overcrowding. About 25,000 students  ride buses for up to an hour because there is no room at their local schools.  </P> <P> District staff will try to find ways to improve the program, such as shortening  travel time, channeling more money to receiving schools to help new students,  and establishing long-term pairings of sending and receiving schools to allow  bused students to attend elementary, junior and senior high in one area.  </P> <P> The motion was sponsored by Westside board representative Mark Slavkin. Schools  in his area received thousands of new bused-in students last fall.  </P> <P> South-Central Los Angeles representative Rita Walters voted 'no', saying the  measure focuses too heavily on the needs of receiving schools while ignoring  the problems of overcrowded areas.  </P></p>

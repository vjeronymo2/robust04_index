			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Observer: Know your game Liz Forgan, the new managing director of BBC Radio, seems to be finding her feet at the Beeb. Immediately after announcing she was replacing Radio One's Johnny Beerling, the BBC's longest-serving programme controller, she shot off to the Lords Test. The former Channel 4 programme boss admits not liking cricket but says that BBC life seems to revolve around the game. And anyway, she'd been offered 'Dukie's box' - normally reserved for chairman Marmaduke Hussey. As for advertising for Beerling's replacement, she's all for it. So why wasn't her job advertised? 'Sometimes it's difficult and inappropriate' - just the sort of stone-walling you'd expect from one of the Beeb's first eleven.</p>

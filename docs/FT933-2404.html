			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Shares and the Revenue Can you tell me if it is strictly necessary to give details on a tax return of share disposals exceeding Pounds 11,600 in a tax year even though capital gains do not exceed Pounds 5,800? It seems rather pointless. If so will the Inland Revenue require copies of the relevant sale contract? I have a number of sales where I am only part of a group sale (to save commission) although contracts are in my name, or in joint names with my wife. 1) Yes; subsection 6(b) of section 3 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 only lets you off the hook (subject to your tax inspector's tacit consent) if 'the aggregate amount or value of the consideration for all disposals made by (you) (other than disposals, gains accruing on which are not chargeable gains) does not exceed an amount equal to twice the exempt amount for the year'. 2) No, probably not (although the inspector has the right to ask, if he or she wishes to check the facts stated in your tax return). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

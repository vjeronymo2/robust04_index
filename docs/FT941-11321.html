			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / International Company News: Continental Air in the black Continental Airlines, the Texas-based carrier that emerged from its second bankruptcy in April last year, yesterday reported an operating profit of Dollars 8.5m for the fourth quarter, compared with operating losses of Dollars 43.7m in the comparable 1992 period. Its net losses, however, rose from Dollars 13.9m last time to Dollars 26.5m, or Dollars 1.47 a share, but Continental said the comparable period's results were favourably affected by Dollars 62m worth of non-recurring adjustments mainly related to litigation settlements. For the eight months from its reorganisation to the end of 1993, it reported net losses of Dollars 38.5m, or Dollars 2.33 a share. No meaningful comparison is available for the previous year because the company was in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Mr Robert Ferguson, chairman and chief executive, said the fourth quarter's results were evidence of the company's continuing progress with cost reductions and improved marketing. Earlier this week Continental put further downward pressure on US air fares by announcing it was increasing the number of cut-price flights it offers each day from 304 to 875, more than half its daily total of 1,599 departures. The move makes it better able to compete with small, low-cost carriers like the Texas-based Southwest Airlines, which are transforming the domestic short-haul market by turning air travel into a no-frills commodity business. Late yesterday Southwest, the only consistently profitable airline in the US, reported a surge in net income from Dollars 26.8m last time to Dollars 38.4m for the fourth quarter, lifting earnings per share from 18 cents to 26 cents. For the full year, net income rose by 54 per cent to Dollars 169.5m.</p>

			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / World Trade News: EC and Japan fail to agree car quotas - Political solution on exports 'now more likely' THE EC and Japan failed to agree on quotas for Japanese car exports to the EC, after two days of negotiations which closed in Tokyo yesterday. The failure to reach an agreement increases the possibility that the negotiations on whether Japan should reduce its car exports to the EC, and to what extent, might be settled by a 'political' solution, according to an official of the EC Commission. 'There is a recognition on the two sides that 1993 will be a year of contraction of the EC automobile and light commercial vehicle market,' Mr Robert Verrue, director in charge of the internal market and general affairs at the Commission, said in Tokyo yesterday. The EC and Japan have agreed to monitor Japanese vehicle exports to the EC to pave the way for a smooth transition to unrestricted exports by the year 2000. Until then a quota based on the outlook for the EC vehicle market would be used to restrict Japanese exports to the EC. However, the two sides have not been able to agree on the outlook for demand in 1993. The EC has said demand in the European market would fall considerably from 1992, while Japan had, until recently, been forecasting that the EC market would expand in 1993. Japan now accepts that demand will fall this year, but the EC, which in December had forecast a decline of about 2.6 per cent in registrations, now believes it will fall even further, by 4-6 per cent. The EC's stance is that since market demand is falling Japan should share the burden of cutting supply by reducing the level of its exports from 1.19m units in 1992. 'Otherwise we would fear that markets would be under strains and sometimes under excessive strains,' Mr Verrue said. There is disagreement, in particular, on the forecast for the German market, which because of its size would have a considerable impact on the overall quota. The Commission was careful to emphasise that while it took into account all factors, including the level of Japanese local production in the EC, in arriving at a market forecast, the negotiations with Japan on a quota concerned Japanese exports alone and not cars made in the EC. As a result of the failure of the talks, the two sides will meet again, possibly within the month, to continue their talks, but Mr Verrue emphasised that there was likely to be only one more meeting. The state of the vehicle market in 1993 was expected to be so bad that unless agreement was reached 'the way the burden would be shared. . . would in the end be subject to a political decision,' Mr Verrue said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "A Heated Exchange Inevitable Over </F> Objective Criteria"]    [Text] Japan and the United States will hold vice  ministerial negotiations on automobiles and auto parts beginning  10 June in Tokyo under the resumed Japanese-U.S. economic  framework talks. Working-level negotiations on the three  priority sectors of automobiles, government procurement, and  insurance were held with division-chief-level officials from the  two countries in attendance prior to the vice ministerial  negotiations, but the working-level negotiations ended after  both sides only exchanged views on their differences.  "Objective criteria" have been the focus of contention in the  Japanese-U.S. economic framework talks, and the two countries  have just started a full-fledged discussion of them. While some  officials at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry  [MITI] say, "We intend to seek a settlement on all three  priority sectors prior to the summit talks of major  industrialized nations (the Naples summit) scheduled for July,"  the U.S. side is taking a wary attitude toward settling the  three priority sectors, saying, "There is a possibility of the  two countries agreeing on only part of them."    At the outset of the working-level negotiations on  automobiles, which were held in the Foreign Ministry on 3 June  with division- chief-level officials from the two countries, the  U.S. side said, "Let us not take up the quantitative criteria  for discussion at these negotiations." The quantitative  criteria may lead to a numerical target depending on how the  "objective criteria" are handled in the future. The U.S. side  wanted to put off discussing the quantitative criteria.  <H5>  Hard To Fathom Real Intent </H5>   At the working-level negotiations on automobiles, both  Japanese and U.S. officials almost completed the discussion of  qualitative criteria. They made a certain headway by agreeing  to adopt a criterion to measure progress in the improvement of  bidding procedures, but they agreed to put off discussing the  quantitative criteria to mid-June until after the second round  of the vice ministerial negotiations. In late May, U.S. Trade  Representative Mickey Kantor asked Japan to increase the number  of car dealers selling foreign automobiles as an example of the  objective criteria to measure the sales of foreign automobiles  and auto parts in Japan, claiming, "Japan is supposed to promise  to increase the number of car dealers selling foreign-built  automobiles." His remark was tantamount to denying Japan's view  that "The United States will not seek to set any numerical  targets."    A senior MITI official, for whom it seems hard to fathom the  United States' true intentions, asks: "What do stores dealing  in foreign cars mean after all? Do they mean car dealers  selling foreign cars or dealerships selling foreign cars  exclusively?" The handling of the objective criteria, including  the definition of car dealers, will inevitably become a focal  point at the vice ministerial negotiations that will be held  between Under Secretary of Commerce Jeffrey Garten and MITI  Deputy Minister Okamatsu for two days beginning 10 June.    The Japanese side has raised an objection to adopting the  objective criteria to gauge the amount of auto parts imported by  Japan, the number of U.S.-built right-hand-drive automobiles  sold on the Japanese vehicle market, and the number of finished  automobiles imported by Japan. The United States plans to  propose that both Japan and the United States jointly assess  these twice a year. The United States, however, may assert that  the objective criteria should be set in a way that the number of  car dealers selling foreign-built automobiles in Japan will  increase visibly.  <H5>  NTT Is the Obstacle </H5>   Another set of working-level negotiations on the insurance  sector have only confirmed areas of agreement and differences  but included no in-depth discussion of how the objective  criteria should be set for that sector. At issue is how to  treat foreign insurance companies that are expected to suffer  financially by the deregulation of the third sector, in terms of  insurance for safety custody [kaigo], injury, and disease. A  Japanese negotiator anticipates rough sailing at the future  negotiations, saying, "We do not necessarily need to reach an  agreement with the U.S. side on the insurance sector prior to  the Naples summit."    Both Japan and the United States share the common view that  "they must avoid creating a situation wherein the upcoming  Japanese-U.S. summit talks are broken off again by settling  first the insurance and automobile sectors out of the three  priority sectors." In February, the two countries agreed 90  percent on the issue of government procurement (according to a  Japanese Government source). The handling of the Nippon  Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT) issue is an obstacle  to concluding the government procurement talks. The U.S. side  has insisted that the NTT's procurement of communications  equipment be taken up for discussion at the framework talks. In  response, the Japanese side has rejected the U.S. side's demand,  arguing, "It is improper for the framework talks to discuss  procurement by a company that has been privatized." In this  way, the two sides have confronted each other over NTT's  procurement of communications equipment.    NTT is set to take the lead in building the next-generation  communications network in which Japan is expected to make a  massive investment. This prospect has prompted the U.S. side to  make its demand. The Japanese side intends to seek the  understanding of the U.S. side by proposing that another set of  bilateral negotiations be held to discuss the issue of NTT's  procurement practices.  <H5>  MITI Eager To Speed Up Negotiations </H5>   U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, who is mindful of  the subtle differences in the progress achieved in the  individual sector-by-sector negotiations, has indicated the  prospect that "Japan and the United States will reach a partial  agreement at the upcoming Japanese-U.S. summit talks." The  negotiations on the automobile sector have lagged behind those  on the other sectors. MITI and other relevant ministries, who  are concerned by the possibility that "the two countries may put  off reaching an agreement on the automobile sector, which has  been taken as a symbol of Japanese-U.S. trade frictions," aim to  settle matters in all three sectors. If Japan is too hasty in  wanting to reach an agreement on the automobile sector, it will  then have to make extensive concessions to do so. While the  Japanese automobile industry is paying attention to the  negotiations, the two countries have only one month before the  Naples summit is held.</p>

			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / International Company News: Chubb lifted by investment gains CHUBB, the US insurer, yesterday lifted after-tax profits to Dollars 617.1m, or Dollars 6.96 a share, in the 12 months to the end of December, compared with Dollars 552m, or Dollars 6.32, in 1991. In the fourth quarter, the New Jersey-based company made a net profit of Dollars 197.5m, or Dollars 2.21 a share, up from Dollars 139.3m, or Dollars 1.58, a year earlier. The annual results came after realised investment gains of Dollars 123.6m, compared with Dollars 43.4m in the previous year. They also reflected a deterioration on the underwriting front, with Chubb returning a Dollars 15.3m underwriting loss, against an Dollars 18.6m surplus in 1991. This was partly due to heavy catastrophe losses, which have affected the industry generally. Chubb's catastrophe losses last year were Dollars 175.3m, compared with Dollars 71.6m in 1991. American General unveiled after-tax profits of Dollars 532.7m, or Dollars 4.89 a share, in 1992, compared with Dollars 480.2m, or Dollars 4.25, in the previous year. The Houston-based financial services and insurance company said that operating earnings, ahead of realised investment gains, were Dollars 523.7m, compared with Dollars 479.4m in 1991. Standard &amp; Poor's has lowered its rating on the claims-paying ability of Hannover Reinsurance to Double-A-Plus from Triple-A, AP-DJ reports from New York. The downgrade reflects lower operating results and S&amp;P's expectation that future earnings will remain under pressure. 'Operating results in the last five years have been very volatile despite the company's cyclical underwriting strategy,' S&amp;P said. Hannover Re's combined ratio over the period has fluctuated between 109.5 per cent and 124.2 per cent.</p>

			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / World Trade News: Joint air cargo venture AN ANGLO-SOVIET cargo airline is being set up to specialise in transporting heavy loads, using the Russian-built Antonov AN124 Ruslan, one of the world's biggest aircraft, capable of carrying 150 tonnes of cargo. The joint venture airline involves a partnership between HeavyLift Cargo Airlines, a subsidiary of the UK Trafalgar House group, and the Soviet Volga-Dnepr company. The airline is expected to start operating in June, adding more AN124s to its fleet before this year ends. The Soviet transport aircraft, equipped with on-board hoist and crane systems to load heavy goods both front and back, with minimum ground equipment, will be used to carry the largest tracked or wheeled vehicles, aerospace and space-related components, oil pollution control gear, building materials and relief supplies for international agencies. HeavyLift Cargo Airlines operates a fleet of large Belfasts, Hercules, Boeing 707s and Guppy aircraft to transport heavy loads. Soviet officials described the joint venture as 'an important contribution to developing Anglo-Soviet trade and economic relations'. The Soviet partner is one of the first joint stock enterprises set up in the Soviet Union. Still ultimately controlled by the state, these new enterprises do not come under the rigid departmental control, enjoying greater operating flexibility.</p>

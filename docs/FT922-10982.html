			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Observer: Concrete bunker Ex-communists in St Petersburg, still nursing their wounds over the decision to rename Leningrad, will see as another provocation the decision to allow Grand Duke Vladimir Kirillovich, the pretender to the Russian throne abolished in 1917, to be buried in Peter and Paul fortress alongside his ancestors. The request, made by Leoda, the widow of Vladimir, an emigre who spoke poor Russian and set foot in Russia for the first time last year, was granted by vice-mayor Vyacheslav Scherbkov yesterday. Ordinary people are likely to see this as somewhat strange since the duke, who died in Miami last week, was part of an extinct dynasty. They will also be amazed at the amount of rubble which the city authorities will have to remove from the fortress; the Bolsheviks had poured concrete over what was once a special burial place for the grand dukes, but separate from the central cathedral where Peter the Great and other tsars are buried.</p>

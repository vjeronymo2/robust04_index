			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 420.115&blank;Approval and Authorization Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section includes procedures for approval of work programs or projects, and amendments thereto, and authorization for work to be performed with FHWA planning and research funds. The governmentwide common grant management provisions for prior awarding agency approval of certain budget and programmatic changes are referenced at 49 CFR 18.30. While executed project agreements are still necessary, the language in paragraph (c) was revised to eliminate reference to forms PR&hyph;2 and PR&hyph;2A since these forms are currently being revised and the form numbers may change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters believe that the requirement for prior FHWA approval for budget and programmatic changes as specified in 49 CFR 18.30 is contrary to the intent of giving States more responsibility and authority. Some commenters also recommended that, after receiving initial FHWA approval of the work programs, additional FHWA approval should only be sought when a budget revision means additional Federal funds are required. One commenter suggested that FHWA approval be sought only when a budget revision exceeds the limits of $10,000 and 15 percent of a research study cost as specified in 23 CFR 511.3(e).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most of these comments reflect a misunderstanding of the provisions of 49 CFR 18.30 which are governmentwide common grant management provisions that have been applicable to FHWA planning and research funded work programs since revision of OMB Circular A&hyph;102 in 1988 and issuance of 49 CFR part 18. These provisions were included in 23 CFR part 420 in the 1990 update and are unchanged in this final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The limit of $10,000 and 15 percent under 23 CFR 511.3(e), applies to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> individual <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  RD&amp;T studies; for example, a cost increase of greater than $15,000 for a $100,000 study would require prior approval. Under the provisions of 49 CFR 18.30(c)(1)(ii), the State may make budget transfers among direct cost categories (e.g., individual RD&amp;T studies) without FHWA prior approval unless the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> total  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> of such transfers over the period of the work program will, or is expected to, exceed the larger of $100,000 or 10 percent of the total approved (i.e., work program) budget. For example, if an RD&amp;T work program totals $2 million, the State may transfer $200,000 among direct cost line items included in the work program without prior FHWA approval. At the discretion of the FHWA, this prior approval requirement may be waived. Thus the use of the provisions of 49 CFR 18.30 provide more flexibility and authority to the State than the provisions that are being replaced.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On the other hand, a budget change that involves an increase in the total funds authorized for the work program still requires prior FHWA approval and authorization. Similarly, the programmatic changes (e.g., adding a line item, contracting out) specified in 49 CFR 18.30(d) require prior FHWA approval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter interpreted the provisions of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section to imply that the State can impose obligation limitations on subrecipients of the PL funds and requested that it be clarified to indicate that such limits can indeed be applied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The provisions of these paragraphs are not new and are not related to the issue of distribution of available obligation authority within a State. These provisions allow work to proceed and be reimbursed at a later date in situations where sufficient funds or obligation authority are not available at the time authorization is requested for all work in a statewide or metropolitan area work program. Obligation authority is distributed to the States for use by the States as determined in cooperation with the FHWA field offices. In general, neither legislation nor the FHWA specifies categories of funds for which the States must use the obligation authority. States may choose to request authorization of only a portion of the PL funds needed for a work program period, but would then need to ensure that additional funds are requested and authorized prior to the MPO proceeding with the remainder of the work program. Such partial funding necessitates processing of project amendments and additional paperwork. It also could result in an MPO performing work that would be ineligible for reimbursement if the work is performed prior to approval of the amendment. Such partial funding should be avoided if possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

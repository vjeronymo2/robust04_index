			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / International Company News: SBC continues global expansion with US deal Swiss Bank Corporation, Switzerland's third largest bank, is acquiring Brinson Partners, a leading US investment management firm, as part of its strategy for building up a global institutional asset management business. SBC said in Zurich yesterday it would charge Dollars 750m against its capital reserves for the purchase, although the final cost would depend on the performance of Brinson over at least seven years. It had pre-tax profits of Dollars 35m last year. The Chicago based Brinson, with assets under management of Dollars 36bn and a staff of 233, is the second big US acquisition made by SBC in the past two years. In 1992, it bought the business of the O'Conner Partnerships, also of Chicago and specialised in the use of futures, options and other so-called derivative products in investment risk management. Mr Marcel Ospel, global markets director, said acquisition was the only practical way for a big Swiss bank to keep pace in sectors that were developing quickly elsewhere, particularly in the US. SBC would integrate its own institutional asset management business with that of Brinson in a new division under the direction of Mr Gary Brinson. Together, they would manage some Dollars 65bn. The bank said Brinson, formerly First Chicago Investment Advisors, pioneered active management of global portfolios for US clients in the early 1980s. It has built up a strong position in the US but wants to extend its reach throughout the world. As part of the acquisition, SBC would take over Brinson's 1991 joint venture with Yasuda Fire &amp; Marine Insurance of Japan. Mr Georges Blum, SBC chief executive, said Brinson would 'reinforce the share of stable and sustainable income streams' of the bank, a remark that appeared aimed partly at responding to recent criticism of its earnings volatility. In the first half of 1993, profits before taxes and provisions plunged 45 per cent to SFr1.2bn (Dollars 900m) mainly due to a 63 per cent slide in trading income. Mr Blum said the directors had reassessed their strategy but decided to make no changes in the light of the disappointing results. 'We are out to achieve as broad a diversification as possible in our income streams,' he said. For the first time, he revealed a breakdown of operating income by division. The Swiss domestic division made SFr2.36bn, 70 per cent of the total, while the international and finance division contributed SFr899m.</p>

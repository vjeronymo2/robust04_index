			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Lenin's namesake carries capitalist flag: Vladivostok is heading for the free economy thanks to one Vladimir Ulianov Perched on Russia's craggy eastern coast, Vladivostok is a potentially vibrant Pacific Rim city struggling to emerge from its dross Soviet shell. Right-hand drive Japanese cars - a third of the price of inferior Russian vehicles - abound. The best hotel in town, the Vlad Motor Inn, was shipped over, fully built from western Canada and offers the same amenities as any comfortable Canadian inn, from fluffy towels to Molson's beer. But, as the ugly Soviet apartment blocks which mar Vladivostok's picturesque natural setting suggest, the city's and Russia's communist past still threatens to block its market development. The home port of the rusting Pacific fleet and the site of defence industries which employ much of the city's workforce, Vladivostok has a powerful anti-reform constituency, which has found an ally in the region's new governor. Moreover, the xenophobia which was expressed here and elsewhere in Russia, with strong support for the extreme right in the December elections, has an added fillip in Vladivostok because of widespread local fears of economically thriving China, just a three-hour drive away. Vladivostok's biggest success story is its stock exchange, the most active in Russia. Unlike most exchanges in the country, which trade in commodities or privatisation vouchers, the Vladivostok exchange trades only in the shares of privatised companies. It can do so because 230 of the 500 large-scale enterprises in the Vladivostok area have already been transformed into joint stock companies - a figure which makes the region Russia's leader in large-scale privatisation. Mr Viktor Sakharov, a bearded former marine biologist who is president of the stock exchange, says the booming activity on the exchange, where Rbs100m worth of shares are traded on average each week, is teaching the directors of local large enterprises to look to the private sector rather than the government for capital. 'Factory directors are beginning to understand that no-one will give them money any more, that the days of cheap credits are over,' says Mr Sakharov, who gives weekly economics lectures to the 'Red Barons' in the hope of 'pounding some market economics into their heads'. The managers are learning. Mr Sakharov believes that that the only way to get capital investment is through share offers. Foreigners are also starting to get in on the action. Mr Sakharov estimates that British, Australian, South Korean and Japanese investors have already purchased Dollars 3m (Pounds 2m) worth of shares and says Dollars 24m is in the pipeline from the United States and the UK. The biggest obstacle to more foreign investment is physical. To buy shares traded on the Vladivostok stock exchange investors must first make the gruelling journey to this Pacific outpost. A few hardy western businessmen live in Vladivostok and act as local agents for UK, US and Asian companies. Investing could become easier if Seji, the most active investment company operating on the exchange, succeeds in its plan to open an office at the Hong Kong stock exchange this spring. Seji's trading operations are run by the ironically named Mr Vladimir Ulianov. But although the thin, nervy businessman bears the name Russia's first Bolshevik leader was known by until he assumed the more familiar nom de guerre of Lenin, the present-day Mr Ulianov is the face of Russia's fledgling, and embattled, capitalist revolution. In 1991, Mr Ulianov and a small group of fellow officers serving in the Pacific fleet decided that they had better prospects working in Russia's nascent market economy than in its rusting navy. Since then, it's been clear sailing. Seji now has working capital approaching Rbs2bn and in November alone turned a profit of Rbs368m speculating in the shares of just one company, Sesco, the Far Eastern Shipping Company. A typical project is Seji's plan to finance the production of light aircraft at a local defence plant in which it holds a 10 per cent interest. Seji is willing to raise the Rbs3bn which the cash-strapped factory requires to produce helicopters and light aircraft, but only on the condition that it has control over how the money is spent and where the profits from eventual sales go. Without tough controls, Mr Ulianov explains, any investment in a Russian factory disappears in subsidies to loss-making divisions of the enterprise. 'Crudely put, our strategy is not to give any cash to the factory directors,' Mr Ulianov says. 'The factory is only allowed to be the assembler.' This is the maxim of every successful Russian businessman, but it is a point which has been lost on western aid donors and on the representatives of the old Soviet elite at the top of the Russian government, including the prime minister, Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, whose hand has been strengthened by the result of the December elections. If Mr Chernomyrdin has his way and the flow of soft credits to Russia's 'Red Barons' is renewed, they will again be in a position to resist the tough financial constraints imposed by private businessmen such as Mr Ulianov and other investors in Vladivostok's exchange. Citing this sort of anti-reform action in the aftermath of the elections, a worried Mr Sakharov said: 'We knew our people were stupid, that they were an ignorant, lumpen proletariat, but we had no idea that they were quite so stupid.'</p>

This figure shows a radical change in  the trend in unemployment, since there was a net increase in the  number of jobs being created for the first time since the crisis  began.    Deputy Prime Minister Narcis Serra asserted yesterday that  "there are now signs of economic recovery which make it possible  to say we have rounded the corner in the crisis and the worst is  over." Nevertheless, he emphasized that unless society as a  whole -- government, trade unions, and employers -- continues to  keep up a considerable effort, it will not be possible to  maintain sustained growth as a job-promoting factor.    Speaking to Spanish National Radio, Serra said that the  February unemployment figures, which the Labor Ministry will  present officially Saturday, "will represent the beginning of a  radical change in the trend in unemployment in Spain."    Nevertheless, this recovery in employment has not been  enough  to absorb the increase in the working population. Serra stated  that the fact that the first signs of recovery are appearing is  causing a larger number of citizens to register at INEM offices.  This is why the number of unemployed will continue to rise,  although at a much more moderate rate. "The number of  unemployed will begin to fall significantly during the summer  months, which is when there is the greatest activity in  services."    The Labor Ministry emphasizes that the most significant  thing  about February is that for the first time there is a net  increase in employment, since the number of enterprises' labor  contracts exceeds the number of job losses.  <H5>  Net Jobs Are Created </H5>   The second indicator of the labor market's recovery comes  from the increase in social security contributors, whose numbers  grew for the first time by 71,000 contributors. It must be  pointed out that this rise comes after a systematic fall for 24  months, which represented a drop of over 800,000 contributors.  According to government sources, this improvement in the labor  market is due to a recovery in the economic situation and to the  first fruits which the new apprenticeship and practical training  contracts are producing. Up to 20 February, 35,000 contracts of  these kinds were signed.    These figures show that there has been no "replacement  effect," as the trade unions have been maintaining. According  to the available figures, it is not true that enterprises have  dismissed permanent workers in order to hire apprentices.    Labor Minister Jose Antonio Grinan said in the Congress [of  Deputies] lobbies yesterday that February's figures represent  the breaking of a trend for unemployment to rise. "While  waiting to learn the official figures, it must be stated that  February was hopeful, since this month is traditionally bad for  employment, and yet there was a net increase."    After asserting that the new forms of hiring "are going very  well," he stressed that, contrary to the fears expressed by  various sectors, apprentices have not replaced permanent  workers, since "the number of of apprentices coincides with the  increase in hiring which has occurred in general." He  emphasized the construction sector's good performance and  expressed his confidence that "the trend will continue over the  next few months."    On the economic situation, Narcis Serra believes that the  signs the recovery has begun have been reflected not just in the  trend in the labor market but in industrial activity, car sales,  cement and power consumption, and the sharp fall in interest  rates.

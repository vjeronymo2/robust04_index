			<p><P> July 2, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STALWART CHARGER LIGHTS SILVER SCREEN;  </P> <P> HORSE RACING: GELDING WINS BY 4 1/2 LENGTHS, PROMPTS TRAINER TO CALL HIM BEST  3-YEAR-OLD IN THE UNITED STATES.  </P> <P> Forget about Unbridled, Summer Squall or all other 3-year-olds anybody cares to  mention.  </P> <P> According to Pico Perdomo, each of them has to take a back seat to his Stalwart  Charger.  </P> <P> "No 3-year-old in the country can touch this horse," he said after the gelded  son of Stalwart did exactly what he was supposed to do in the $160,100 Silver  Screen Handicap Sunday at Hollywood Park.  </P> <P> Making his first start since he dominated his California Derby foes April 21,  the 3-5 favorite drew away when asked in the final furlong to win by 4 1/2  lengths.  </P> <P> The final time of 1:48 2/5 wasn't earth-shattering and neither was the  competition -- Toby Jug, the longest shot in the field at almost 20-1, was  second -- but this didn't faze Perdomo.  </P> <P> The trainer has never been afraid to speak his mind when it comes to Stalwart  Charger, and he seemed almost defiant in the winner's circle Sunday after he  won for the fourth time in five starts.  </P> <P> "He didn't prove much in this race except for a couple of things," he said. "He  proved if you have a bazooka, I know how to pull the trigger. Something people  have to know is that I know how to train a good horse. This proved to people  that I know my business.  </P> <P> "I've told everybody all along, there's no competition in the country for this  horse. I was telling people this long before he broke his maiden (Feb. 11 at  Santa Anita). Now, you're waiting to cut my neck, no? Well, you better get a  chair and sit because it's going to be a long time."  </P> <P> Now, it's on to the $200,000 Swaps in three weeks for owner Sidney Factor's  chestnut, who was purchased for $27,500 as a 2-year-old, then the Super Derby  in September.  </P> <P> "He cruised," the trainer said while watching the replay in the infield. "His  ears were pricked. It doesn't matter four lengths, five lengths or a neck. It  doesn't matter. He just does what he has to do."  </P> <P> Third behind Big Bass and 5-2 second choice Kentucky Jazz early, Stalwart  Charger moved up to engage the latter around the turn, then pulled away through  the stretch.  </P> <P> Toby Jug, who trailed most of the way, was nearly two lengths better than  Kentucky Jazz, then came Big Bass and Warcraft. Music Prospector was scratched.  </P> <P> Aboard Stalwart Charger for the first time in the afternoon, Pincay came away  impressed.  </P> <P> "I really believe he could be a really top horse," he said. "You hate to get  high on horses because a lot of them disappoint you, but I think this race is  going to do him a lot of good.  </P> <P> "He's kind of a lazy horse and he was kind of intimidated being on the inside  (at the start). You just have to make him do everything. One day, he's going to  decide to run and he's going to be a much better horse.  </P> <P> "I was afraid he might get a little tired today, but he was finishing. I could  feel that he was still strong. I think he likes the whip. Every time I hit him,  he gave me a little more. The time wasn't that fast, but when I moved up to  second with him, I just sat there for a long time because I didn't want to open  up with him. He tends to loaf when he's on the lead. I'm going to keep my  fingers crossed that he keeps improving."  </P> <P> Steinlen, who bypassed the recent Inglewood Handicap, will carry top weight of  125 pounds Wednesday in the $200,000-added American Handicap at Hollywood Park.  </P> <P> Conqueror of Hawkster, Golden Pheasant and others in the Hollywood Turf  Handicap, Steinlen was one of seven entered Sunday morning for the American,  which will be run at 1 1/8 miles on the turf.  </P> <P> Laffit Pincay, who took over from Jose Santos on the 1989 Eclipse Award winner  in the Turf Handicap, again has the call. On that day, Santos rode Criminal  Type to an upset victory over Easy Goer and Housebuster in the Metropolitan  Mile at Belmont Park.  </P> <P> Those scheduled to oppose Steinlen are Classic Fame, third as the favorite in  the Inglewood; Pleasant Variety, third in the Golden Gate Handicap behind  Petite Ile and Valdali; Shining Steel; Mohamed Abdu, who returned after an  extended layoff to win the Inglewood; Gran Judgement, and Colway Rally.  </P> <P> Away since January of 1989 after suffering a leg injury in a race at Turf  Paradise, Mohamed Abdu went right to the front in his comeback, then held off  Peace after they dueled for more than a quarter of a mile.  </P> <P> "That first race back was a very hard race for him," said trainer Richard  Mulhall. "He cleaned up the night of the race and did everything right.  </P> <P> "The American is just a little quick and that concerns me. I didn't have many  alternatives for him and the only other race is the Eddie Read Handicap (next  month at Del Mar). I was also concerned that Hawkster and Peace might go in  this race because they would add some extra speed. With them not going, it  helped us to make a firm decision to run."  </P> <P> Although he never looked like a winner in the Inglewood, Classic Fame, who  finished in front of Steinlen in the John Henry Handicap May 13, was beaten by  a half-length.  </P> <P> "He didn't break too sharp and he was too far back early," trainer Gary Jones  said. "The fact that he was four wide into the stretch was definitely a factor  as well. I think we were unlucky to lose, but those other two ran one heck of a  race. The American's a little quick, but he's training well and I think he's  got a big shot."  </P> <P> Horse Racing Notes  </P> <P> Trainer Pico Perdomo also won the third race with Billy Euforico and he has now  won with five of his 17 starters at Hollywood Park. . . . There was a minus  show pool of $2,313.13 in the sixth race, won by heavily favored My Prayer, and  one of $4,798.13 in the Silver Screen. . . . Stalwart Charger's victory was  worth $91,100 to his owner and pushed his earnings to $310,100. . . . Laffit  Pincay, Julio Garcia and Kent Desormeaux all rode two winners Sunday.  </P></p>

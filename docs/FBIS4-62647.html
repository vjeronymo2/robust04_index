			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Kuznetsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 18 TASS -- One of the contenders of  presidency in Belarus, Aleksandr Lukashenko, today called for  unification of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus at a plenary session  of the Russian State Duma. Given the floor by a majority  decision in the Russian parliament's chamber he urged the three  countries to set up a joint parliamentary group and to go to  work on the documents, on the basis of which the three  republics, which initiated the creation of the Commonwealth of  Independent States, will be able to reunify.    Lukashenko called that decision "a mistake made in December  1991", which should be recognised as such.    Chairman of the Duma Committee for Commonwealth Affairs  Konstantin Zatulin then proposed that a record be made in the  minutes of the chamber's plenary meeting to the effect that the  speech of the Belarusian colleague "in no way reflects the State  Duma's position".    Russia's Choice also disavowed Lukashenko's statement. Its  representative Boris Zolotukhin called for declaring  Lukashenko's address to the Duma "inappropriate, as being  directly connected with his presidential election campaigning".  He recalled that according to parliamentary standards, the Duma  can only be addressed by a representative of the official  parliamentary delegation from Belarus.</p>

			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Observer: Razor tongue Guess who Australia's forthright premier Paul Keating has now dubbed 'unrepresentative swill'. No, not the British monarchy, but the Australian senate whom, for good measure, he also called 'pansies'. The term tripped off his razor-tongue when he was defending his refusal to let federal finance minister John Dawkins give evidence to a senate inquiry into claims that the government concealed breaches of borrowing regulations by Victoria's former Labor leaders. Keating is a long-standing critic of the senate, deeming it unrepresentative because it consists of equal numbers of members from each state, regardless of population. And the nub of his speech was that members of the house of representatives, such as Dawkins, are not constitutionally responsible to the upper house. As so often, however, the point he wanted to make has been smothered by the row over the language he used in expressing it. Senate opposition leader Robert Hill demanded Keating's resig- nation saying he was the most personally offensive Australian Prime Minister ever. That's quite a charge in a country where 'scumbag' is acceptable parliamentary language.</p>

			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Russian debt plan for promissory notes The Russian Ministry of Finance proposed yesterday that promissory notes be used to resolve the country's growing debt crisis. The inter-enterprise debt, which government officials said now exceeds Rbs100,000bn (Pounds 30bn), threatens to paralyse the Russian economy and is developing into the Kremlin's top political concern. Mr Sergei Dubinin, the acting minister of finance, presented a draft law on the introduction of promissory notes to yesterday's meeting of the Russian government's emergency commission on the debt crisis. According to Russian news agencies, Mr Dubinin's proposal is that promissory notes, backed by government guarantees, should be used to cover enterprises' current debts for goods which have already been delivered. Eventually, he told the commission, all the inter-enterprise debt would be translated into promissory notes. A presidential decree last spring made a similar scheme mandatory in an early effort to head off the debt crisis, but Russian enterprises largely failed to comply, according to Mr Fyodor Andryev, a board member of Tver Universal Bank, which is active in the corporate debt market. But the new plan, whose details remain vague even to senior Russian government officials, is being sceptically received by reformist members of the Russian administration and senior western analysts and bankers. They fear the promissory notes, particularly if backed by the government and indiscriminately issued to enterprises, could merely become disguised government loans. Mr Sergei Aleksashenko, the deputy minister of finance and an advocate of tough market reforms, rejected his minister's own proposal. 'The minister must be mistaken,' Mr Aleksashenko said. 'My government will never bail out indebted enterprises either through government backed promissory notes or more directly.' Russia's experience with high inflation has made the government wary of directly handing out soft loans, but many Russian officials also fear the political implications of allowing large numbers of inefficient, indebted enterprises to go bankrupt. Western analysts fear that a promissory note programme could, in the guise of a solution to the debt problem, merely be a way of postponing the final day of reckoning. 'They smell to me of another government bail-out,' one senior western economist said. A western banker working in Moscow said the proposal 'does not address the basic problem and could even create some new problems'. In his view, the best solution to the debt mountain - which he said 'is getting to be a crisis; there is a real debt spiral developing' - would be for the government to intervene as little as possible. The banker pointed out that debt was already very expensive for Russian companies and that to lower their debt burden some enterprises were beginning to offer investors debt for equity swaps. Any government programme which indiscriminantly assisted both more and less indebted enterprises, he said, would harm those more efficient factories which have sought to reduce their debt load on their own initiative.</p>

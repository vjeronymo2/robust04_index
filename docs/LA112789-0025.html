			<p><P> November 27, 1989, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HERE THEY SHED THE CITY AND DANCE INTO THEIR JEWISH PAST  </P> <P> West of the San Fernando Valley, under the shadow of the rugged Santa Susana  Mountains, Peppertree Lane turns abruptly away from modern life. A sharp turn  off Simi Valley's bustling Los Angeles Avenue, and strip shopping centers and  tract houses are replaced by decades-old peppertrees and enormous cacti.  </P> <P> Here, surrounded by the teeming suburb, is the Brandeis-Bardin Institute -- an  oasis of natural beauty and ethnic heritage. And it is here, in this  kibbutz-like setting of orange trees and carefully laid, stone-lined paths,  that 100 Jewish men and women spent Thanksgiving weekend, immersing themselves  in Israeli folk dancing and taking a break from modern life.  </P> <P> "Step-step-step. Step-step-step. Listen to the sound of your feet!" commanded  choreographer Dani Dassa, his eyebrows as dense as his Israeli accent, to his  sluggish beginners' class.  </P> <P> "Listen, you're not listening!" he repeated, redemonstrating a basic step  during a Saturday morning workshop.  </P> <P> "Now," he smiled, as the dancers finally skipped in a smooth, continuous  circle. "Now, it's unified -- like the roll of a drum."  </P> <P> The institute was founded in 1947 by a Ukrainian academic named Shlomo Bardin,  who conceived the idea with U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis D. Brandeis.  Brandeis died in 1941, long before land could be found for the project.  </P> <P> The institute holds a variety of seminars, weekend retreats and summer camps  designed for assimilated Jews to rediscover their culture. Thanks largely to  Dassa, a 61-year-old Leonard Bernstein look-alike fond of cupping students'  faces in his hands, the folk dance retreats are among the most popular  programs.  </P> <P> "I think the appeal is community," said Dassa's wife, Judy, a New York native  who enjoys watching talent and love bloom under her husband's direction.  </P> <P> "You hold hands. You put hands on shoulders. You can talk to people without  feeling pressure. You don't have to wait to be asked to dance. It links them to  a people, a community, a country, a language -- it links them to a world."  </P> <P> Last weekend's unmarried participants came from as far away as Seattle, Chicago  and Wyoming to dance in the hills with strangers. Many had attended previous  dance retreats or summer camp at Brandeis. Others simply wanted something  different and the chance to meet someone Jewish. For $140, they got a  meals-included experience that combined Southern California's fitness  philosophy with Israeli history and lore.  </P> <P> The weekend began Friday evening with Sabbath services and dinner and ended  Sunday with a final dance review and lunch. Between dance sessions, students  could roam the institute's 3,100 acres, chosen by Bardin for their resemblance  to Palestine.  </P> <P> "For me, to go dancing is therapeutic," said Michal Robins, 35, an Israeli-born  psychologist from Woodland Hills. "It's amazing. It's cathartic. It's  cleansing. It's physical," she said.  </P> <P> "It's almost like an addiction. Night comes, and you just feel you have to go.  It's exercise, it has group dynamics, romance -- everything a person wants to  have is in one chunk."  </P> <P> "It's social and it's exercise and it's a tie to the culture all at once," said  Debra Samuels, a 30-year-old marketing researcher from Chicago who keeps a  kosher home and performs with an Israeli folk dance troupe.  </P> <P> That enthusiasm was reflected in the vanity plates on cars lining Peppertree  Lane: B DANCN, DNC WIME and I DEBKA, refering to a classic Eastern European  line dance.  </P> <P> A young chiropractor from Tarzana came to "get a good Jewish experience again"  after a decade devoted largely to study and ambition.  </P> <P> "Since May, I've had a spiritual revelation," said the chiropractor,  29-year-old Steve Katz. "I went to the Esalen Institute and got in touch again  with my spirituality. The chiropractor working with me suggested I go there  after passing my boards, sort of to rejuvenate. He thought it'd be good for me.  </P> <P> "It was a major experience," Katz continued. "It reminded me of my times at  temple, that there is spirituality within the world."  </P> <P> A 31-year-old architect from Jackson, Wyo., attended a summer program for  college students at Brandeis 10 years ago and has "always had a real warm  feeling about this place."  </P> <P> At the same time, Larry Thalsaid, "a little bit of the Jewish part of myself  has woken up. Somehow, it felt rather important to get back to my spiritual  self, as if the rational side of humanity just was not quite making it."  </P> <P> A real estate agent from Chatsworth, 28-year-old Lloyd San, said simply: "Maybe  I'm at an age where I want to know more about who I am."  </P> <P> After fueling up on an Israeli-style breakfast of cottage cheese, tomatoes,  cucumbers and hard-boiled eggs, dancers broke into two workshops Saturday  morning, one for beginners and one for advanced students.  </P> <P> "Yemenite left, Yemenite right, a rum-pum-pum, a rum-pum-pum . . ." Dassa  intoned for his beginners.  </P> <P> In Southern California "everything is very separate, and since everyone gets  into his own car, it can be very isolating," Judy Dassa whispered as her  husband taught. "We see a lot of college kids and there's a kind of  desperation. They want to meet someone and they're afraid they won't. They  don't know how to do it."  </P> <P> Across a footbridge in another dance hall, an anguished love song blasted over  the stereo system. Advanced students, broken into couples, twirled gracefully,  easily following the steps of a visiting instructor from Israel.  </P> <P> Dassa wandered over from the beginners' class, looking on approvingly.  </P> <P> "This is also nature taking its own course," he shrugged.  </P></p>

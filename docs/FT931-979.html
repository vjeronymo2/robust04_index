			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / International Company News: Merrill Lynch alters structure of top management MERRILL LYNCH, the largest US securities firm, has shuffled its top management structure, creating an office of the chairman, to focus on developing client relationships, and an office of the chief executive, to run the company on a day-to-day basis. However, the shake-up has left unclear the answer to one of the more intriguing personnel questions on Wall Street - who is likely to succeed Mr Daniel Tully as president and chief executive of the group? Mr Tully is due to become Merrill's chairman in June on the retirement of Mr William Schreyer, chairman since 1985. The restructuring, Merrill's third in three years, comes at a time of intensifying competition in broking - demonstrated by the recent merger agreement between rivals Smith, Barney and Shearson - and investment banking, an area where Merrill has big ambitions. Mr Tully said the new structure was the 'next logical step in Merrill's strategic evolution over the past two decades from a sales-oriented organisation to a marketing-oriented, client-focused financial management and advisory company'. The office of the chairman includes Messrs Schreyer and Tully along with Mr Stephen Hammerman, vice-chairman, and Mr John Heimann, chairman of global financial institutions. It involves two other men who have been given new titles: Mr Barry Friedberg, head of the investment banking group since 1985, becomes chairman, investment banking. Mr Thomas Patrick, previously executive vice-president, equity markets group, becomes chairman, special advisory services, in charge of liaising with clients on new product ideas. The executive office includes Mr Tully, Mr Hammerman, and Mr John Steffens, executive vice-president for the private client group, along with two other men given new titles: Mr Herbert Allison becomes executive vice-president for investment banking and Mr David Komansky becomes executive vice-president for both the debt and equities markets groups.</p>

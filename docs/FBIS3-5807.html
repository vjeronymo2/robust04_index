Earlier, the puppet deputy minister of foreign affairs  said Wednesday that whether the third round of the talks will be  held or not is "uncertain" because "the nuclear inspection of  the North is not satisfactory" and "the North-South dialogue is  not going smoothly."    As was already reported, an inspectors' group of the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] started its activities  on March 1 according to the agreed conclusions reached at the  DPRK-U.S. contact in New York and the competent organ of the  DPRK is rendering a proper cooperation to it. We are willing to  honestly implement the agreement concerning the IAEA's  inspection for the continuity of safeguards.    Nevertheless, the deputy foreign minister grumbled that the  "IAEA's inspection of the North is not satisfactory." This is  really preposterous.    As for the "rough going of the North-South dialogue" he  talked about, the responsibility for this rests entirely with  the South side.    At the fifth working contact for the exchange of  presidential  envoys between the North and the South, the South side took a  provocative stand by deliberately bringing forward matters  unrelated to the discussion of working procedures to spoil the  atmosphere of the talks.    The puppets are now crying that the North-South dialogue is  not going smoothly after intentionally creating difficulties in  the working contact. This is a ruse to avoid the responsibility.    And it must not go unnoticed that they are persistently  arguing that the progress of the North-South dialogue is a  precondition of the third round of the DPRK-U.S. talks.    As we have already stated, the agreed conclusions reached at  the DPRK-U.S. New York contact include the issue of the  resumption of the working contact for the exchange of special  envoys between the two halves of Korea as a step of simultaneous  action and they do not mention the realization of the exchange.  The DPRK and the United States agreed on the steps of  simultanous action without preconditions.    The puppets' clamour about the preconditions is nothing but  a  despicable attempt to balk the third round of the DPRK-U.S.  talks by intentionally creating obstacles.    The "international cooperation system" sought by the Kim  Yong-sam puppet clique behind the curtain of dialogue to isolate  and stifle the DPRK will result only in precipitating their own  doom.</p>

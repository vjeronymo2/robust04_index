At the opening of CeBit '94, the  international computer fair in Hannover, which runs until 23  March, Boetsch pointed to the key position of this "market of  markets." According to experts' estimates, the worldwide volume  for communication services will be 1.5 trillion German marks  [DM] by the turn of the millennium; in 1990 it was only DM700  billion. This development harbors enormous opportunities of  growth for competitive, flexible industries.    By the year 2010 approximately DM2.4 trillion will be  invested in the European Union in the modernization of  telecommunications infrastructures, the minister stated  referring to the Prognos AG market research institute. In  addition, considerable resources are going to East Europe. A  future-oriented policy creates investment-promoting framework  conditions. The rising pressure of international competition  also intensifies the trend toward private telecommunications  companies.    The positive effects of liberalization can be demonstrated  in  Germany with the examples of mobile radio and satellite radio  communications. Thus, the introduction of competition in mobile  radio telephone systems has led to an increase in the number of  participants from 200,000 to 1.8 million over the past five  years. During the same period, the price for mobile radio  telephone equipment fell from about DM6,000 to DM1,000. In  addition, the opening of the market led to an "impressive  variety of private initiatives," Boetsch said. In Germany 47  licenses for private satellite networks were issued until  February this year. Not least, the number of companies offering  telecommunications services, which was just 66 at the end of  January 1991, increased to 381 by the second week of this  February.  <H5>  "Europe is Lagging Behind" </H5>   In the view of the post minister, industry is preparing for  new times. Sooner or later, the "television set at home will  become an interactive information and communication center," and  that not just in Germany. Therefore, harmonization in the field  of European telecommunications is more important than ever.  Boetsch: "The simultaneous introduction of Euro-ISDN  [Integrated Services Digital Network] in all member states will  make an essential contribution to enlarging the  telecommunications market." At the moment, Euro-ISDN is being  installed by 26 network operators from 20 countries.    Klaus Murmann, president of the Federation of German  Employers' Associations, said that the European locations for  production and services are not yet competitive. In the United  States and also in East Asia the input-output ratio is often  better than that of European competitors, which leads to  production being shifted to these areas. While Europe's share  in world trade is going down, Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore, and  Taiwan, for instance, have doubled their share to 9 percent of  work exports over the past 10 years. Europe is also lagging  behind regarding the creation of new jobs. Over the past 20  years the European Community has created only 0.4 percent of new  jobs, compared with an annual average growth of 1 percent in  Japan and of 1.8 percent in the United States.    In Murmann's view, Germany is in the mood for a new start.  The way toward new structures of labor organization, work time,  and labor costs has been paved by the latest wage contract for  the metal industry. Productivity will increase in Germany. The  average personnel costs increased by 5 percent in 1992. This  year the increase is between 0.0 and 2 percent. In order to  correct the wage policy mistakes of the past decade, one needs  more than three years, Murmann said. He imagines wage contracts  that outline a minimum framework and permit leeway for  components that depend on performance and yield.</p>

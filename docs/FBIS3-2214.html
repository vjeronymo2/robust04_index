			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Shanghai, March 5 (XINHUA) -- The Santana sedan,  German designed model, has 82.26 percent of its parts made in  China, a conference held here yesterday was told.    Experts said that the Santana, built by the Shanghai  Volkswagen Automotive Company Ltd, has become the only  Chinese-made car of a foreign-designed model, for the proportion  of China-made parts now exceeds 80 percent.    The customs department has decreased tariffs by a big margin  on the car's small amount of imported parts, in order to  encourage its mass production.    To double the annual capacity from 100,000 sedans to  200,000,  Shanghai is to inject 2.4 billion yuan into the second-phase  project which aims to improve its production facilities.    The city has also speeded up the development of the car's  new  models. A new-look Santana is expected to make its debut this  autumn.    So far, nearly 200 factories and enterprises have produced  parts for the cars.</p>

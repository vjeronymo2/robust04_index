			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / Arts: Bach's St Matthew Passion - Promenade concert It was a good idea to include snippets of Proms' history in the programmes for the 100th season this year. Without consulting the 'Seasons past' page on Sunday, who would have guessed that it took until 1968 for a piece of music as central as Bach's St Matthew Passion to receive its first performance in the Promenade Concerts? In the early years Henry Wood was a keen advocate of Bach's music, but that only led to excerpts from the score. One of the tenor aria was sung in 1907 and the celebrated alto aria 'Erbarme dich' came round once a decade, but a complete St Matthew Passion was evidently out of the question. It is a sign of how public appreciation of music has been raised that the St Matthew Passion, sung in German, has become commonplace in the Britain of the 1990s. The audience on Sunday may not have been as large as the Proms hoped, but a two-thirds-full Royal Albert Hall at 11am on one of the hottest days of the year is not a bad turnout. The audience to performer ratio was also balanced in the accountants' favour, as this was very far from being the grand Victorian choral pageant that would automatically have been offered 100 years ago. The American conductor Joshua Rifkin was the first to argue that Bach's choral music was originally intended to have one solo singer to a part, not a full choir. Although the subject is still open to dispute, we have had enough experience of small-scale Bach performances over the last decade to come to a conclusion on the essential difference: the great choral works become less public celebrations, more a private avowal of faith. Having a minimal St Matthew Passion in a venue as vast as the Royal Albert Hall might seem a bizarre experiment, but it seemed to work well enough on Sunday. One of the pleasures of hearing eight solo singers in the choral movements is the marvellous clarity and blend that experienced early music singers can attain. Rifkin led a flexible and unexaggerated performance, less fussy with rhythm than Leonhardt, less concentrated than Gardiner. The balance was also well-judged, despite the singers being outnumbered by the combined forces of The Bach Ensemble (from the US) and St James's Baroque Players. John Elwes showed sterling stamina in tackling both the Evangelist's music and some of the solo tenor arias, though he was strained at the top; Stephen Varcoe was a light, eloquent Christus. Among the other soloists, I enjoyed Nancy Argenta's soprano and Mark Padmore's assertive tenor. Steven Rickards's pure counter-tenor projected well, but he pecked at Bach's long, flowing phrases.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 21 Apr (MENA)--PRC President Jiang Zemin has  stressed that the PRC has not changed its principled stance on  the Middle East peace process after establishing ties with  Israel. In a statement in Friday's edition of AL-AHRAM, Jiang  says experience has shown that the existing conflict in the  region can only be resolved through negotiations. He welcomed  the peace agreement between the Palestinians and Israel, and  called on all parties to show flexibility so that through  negotiations results can be reached as quickly as possible.    Jiang stressed that his country, which is a Security Council  permanent member, is ready to work with the international  community and with Egypt to continue efforts toward a quick  comprehensive solution to the Middle East problem. He noted  that his country is linked to the Arab countries through  traditional friendship and that it has consistently supported  the fair cause of the Arab and Palestinian people. He stressed  that his country will continue its positive role in advancing  the peace process in the Middle East, and continue supporting  and developing the region.    Discussing the PRC's experience in the field of economic  reform, Jiang said that the reform process is proceeding  gradually so as to maintain social stability, fairness, and  economic viability simultaneously. He pointed out that the  transformations in the PRC's economy are not too drastic and  that the drastic trend in certain sectors has been checked,  noting that the PRC government is trying to control inflation.</p>

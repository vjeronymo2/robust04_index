			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / World Trade News: ODA out of credit funds THE UK'S Overseas Development Administration (ODA) has already run out of money for spending on mixed credits in the 1991-92 fiscal year, according to an assessment by the Export Group for the Constructional Industries. The current year's allocation was quickly swallowed up by a surge of business in the Far East, notably Malaysia, the group said. The ODA only publishes figures for past spending on mixed credits and does not normally say how much will be available when its aid budget, now running at a total of some Pounds 1.8bn, is established each year. Yesterday, officials confirmed that a large number of successes so far this year means that the forecast for spending over the entire year had been exceeded. However, the ODA said it was still prepared to consider mixed credit deals that would not involve government spending before Aporil 1992.</p>

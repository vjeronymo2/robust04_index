			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE  </P> <P> SPARE NO EXPENSE: The $10.98 tape is here to stay. In recent months George  Michael, the Traveling Wilburys, Whitney Houston, Bell Biv Devoe and Jon Bon  Jovi have put out $10.98 list-priced releases -- and you can bet there's more  to come from major artists next year.  </P> <P> (Meanwhile, Madonna's "Immaculate" hits collection is going for a steep $13.98,  despite the presence of only one new song!) . . . And we knew that Was (Not  Was) co-leader Don Was has been producing plenty of top popsters -- from Bob  Dylan and Iggy Pop to Bonnie Raitt and Elton John. But now he's really boxing  the compass. Was has been in the studio with Paula Abdul, producing two songs  (one written by the Was Bros. with Bob Dylan) while also finishing up a new  Leonard Cohen album -- and preparing a follow-up Bonnie Raitt project. Who's  next? We hear Was has signed on to produce the new Mick Jagger solo album.  </P></p>

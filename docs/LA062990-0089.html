			<p><P> June 29, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SIMI VALLEY;  </P> <P> SAILOR, 22, DIES AFTER BEING HURT IN PACIFIC  </P> <P> A 22-year-old Simi Valley man who was among 16 sailors injured in two  explosions aboard a U. S. aircraft carrier in the Pacific last week has died,  officials said Thursday.  </P> <P> Robert Shane Kilgore died about 11 p.m. Wednesday at the Brooke Army Medical  Center in San Antonio, where he was undergoing treatment for burns over 85% of  his body, said Capt. James English, a hospital spokesman.  </P> <P> Kilgore was a firefighter in the U. S. Navy who aspired to be a Ventura County  firefighter, said Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley).  </P> <P> Gallegly helped several members of Kilgore's family secure free transportation  on commercial airlines, and the sailor's relatives were by his side when he  died, English said. He said he did not know the specific cause of death.  </P> <P> Kilgore was injured during two explosions on July 20 aboard the aircraft  carrier Midway, which had been performing flight exercises 125 miles off the  coast of Yokosuka, Japan. Two other sailors died in the explosion. Kilgore and  seven other injured sailors were flown to the military hospital in San Antonio  on Friday. The other eight injured sailors are being treated at hospitals in  Japan.  </P> <P> Memorial services are pending.  </P> <P> Simi Valley Mayor Gregory Stratton extended his sympathies to Kilgore's family  in a statement he read during a City Council meeting Thursday night.  </P> <P> "Wholesome, energetic and outstanding are some of the words that have been used  to describe Robert Shane Kilgore throughout his life," Stratton said.  </P> <P> "Now, 'hero' has been added to the list of adjectives that describe this  spirited and courageous young man."  </P> <P> The council adjourned its meeting early in Kilgore's honor.

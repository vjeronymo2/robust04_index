			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANN RICHARDS, 'FROM THE HEART'  </P> <P> Now let me get this straight. Texas treasurer Ann Richards, a "funny lady" with  "good-old-gal charms," offered "a rousing start" to "a tough campaign" by  giving us "a good laugh" with her "humorous attack on George Bush."  </P> <P> Somehow, however, the media dubs George Bush responsible for setting the tone  and initiating the "dirtiest, most negative presidential campaign in memory."  </P> <P> I must have missed something. Could you run it by again? Just the  double-standards part will suffice.  </P> <P> JOE PAUL ARNERICH, Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Membership up at reform club: Russia's economic prospects A new wave of economic reform is being planned in Russia. The violent clearing of the ground between President Boris Yeltsin and the Russian parliament which has just been witnessed has - an early judgment would suggest - changed the atmosphere, at least for a while. Conscious that they are working in the shadow of a bloodily suppressed revolt, the reformers are nevertheless determined to take advantage of it to initiate change which has so far eluded them. Both Mr Boris Fyodorov, the deputy prime minister for finance, and Mr Sergei Vassiliev, head of the government's economic reform centre, agree on this: that the spectacle of tanks battering the White House parliament building produced a sudden spasm of acquiescence among institutions, regional councils and individuals that had previously been more or less strongly opposed to central power. Mr Fyodorov, his big-cat smile a little broader, says that, when formerly difficult regional and republican leaders come to see him in his ministry now, 'we have very pleasant conversations'. Mr Vassiliev, working on new plans in the quiet seclusion of the Volynskoye government estate in the Moscow suburbs, says: 'Of course we are all shocked. But for ordinary people it is not at all a bad thing to have a strong man in the Kremlin.' What will the two men do in the period until parliamentary elections, set for December 12? In the short run, not much. Mr Fyodorov says: 'My aim is to get through this period with honour' - by which he means that he will constrain the budget within harsh limits and try to stop his colleagues from making too many expensive promises. He intends to cut the budget deficit for the fourth quarter from an estimated Rbs12,700bn to Rbs4,600bn. Now that Mr Yegor Gaidar has been reappointed first deputy premier for the economy, Mr Fyodorov says, his job is much easier, because he no longer gets demands for increased spending from the economics ministry - 'instead they put in an estimate of the deficit even lower than mine, at under Rbs4,000bn - but you must be realistic'. Mr Vassiliev says that some liberalisation of prices - in energy and grain - with an opening up of foreign trade, will be possible before the elections. There will also be incentives for house construction and the strengthening of private property rights, as well as 'post-privatisation measures' designed to help managers restructure enterprises and run them more efficiently. This, however, does not tackle the central problems. First, there is the delayed matter of financial stabilisation - a process still being planned, on the assumption that the government returned after the elections will be a radical one. Mr Vassiliev believes that the liberal-conservative electoral bloc, Russia's Choice, which Mr Gaidar put together in his months out of government, will do well. 'It is very necessary that we should have a coherent and united government: we don't have it now.' He, with others in the government, believes that the International Monetary Fund must work more closely with the planners on the stabilisation programme than they have. 'They must recognise that the ministries have different demands, and must work with them to find out what laws are needed to implement the programme.' The various packages the IMF has supported in the past have included a fund of at least Dollars 6bn to back the stabilisation of the rouble: the probable aim of the reformers will be to achieve this early next year, perhaps as early as January. The second large area, on which Mr Fyodorov is working, is to develop a fiscal system that allows the regions and the republics to exercise some real financial autonomy - but that at the same time gives the centre authority. To say that the centre and the regions are at each other's throats on control of resources is an oversimplified picture, based on a few republics' refusal to pay taxes, such as the diamond-rich Sakha (formerly Yakutia), and provinces such as the oil-producing Tyumen. Mr Fyodorov says: 'The problem of withholding taxes was exaggerated: when we examined it closely here, it did not seem so bad - they (the regions) remit most of their taxes.' In an average region like Perm in the Urals, with heavy industry, some mineral wealth, and 30 per cent of its working population on the land, there is a recognition that they must work within a rational framework. Mr Viktor Gorbunov, in charge of privatisation in the region, says he cannot get real improvements in the performance of privatised enterprises when inflation is so high - more than 20 per cent in September - and ineffective anti-monopoly legislation fails to promote competition. Above all, he says, 'financial policy cannot be decided by the regions'. Mr Fyodorov wants the regions, like federal Lander in Germany and states in the US, to have control of some tax revenue, under ceilings established by government. He must also tackle the critical, but touchy, matter of redistribution - trying to avoid a free-for-all in which the one-third of regions and republics that are rich get richer, leaving the middle one-third to stagnate, and the one-third cursed with obsolescent industries and/or inefficient agriculture to decline further. 'The value added tax will be the basic mechanism for redistribution,' says Mr Fyodorov. 'We want a single rate to apply all over the country - now the situation is that there are different rates for different regions. 'But we in the centre must stop the system where we intervene everywhere . . . In general, people in the regions like the notion of having some fiscal autonomy: they don't quite know what it means but they like it.' Mr Vassiliev says that when, after the collapse of the old centralised system, it became obvious which parts of the country were 'profitable' and which were not, 'you have a huge problem - how to convince the rich to help the poor. The system must be transparent: perhaps we need a Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (an ironic reference to the Comecon, the former common market for communist states) which really will render mutual assistance.' The political framework will determine everything. The present government remains split - with market reformers like Mr Gaidar and Mr Fyodorov uneasily coexisting with relative conservatives like Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister. While Mr Fyodorov struggles to be rid of Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, chairman of the central bank, Mr Chernomyrdin protects him. Reform under such conditions is possible only in small steps. Says Mr Fyodorov: 'The central bank never says no directly: but it delays, and it does not take the measures it should take without being told to.' The elections should make matters clear in two ways. First it will show the inclinations of the new business groups, which will emerge as the main backers of parties and individuals. Mr Vassiliev says the struggle will be between business groups linked to organised crime groups, with an interest in preserving instability, and others seeking a rational and transparent economy. Second, it will test the will of the country. For while the elections will be chaotic, they will offer candidates that have been identified at federal or regional level with one or other version of reform - or with none. For all the reformers' optimism, the voting intentions of an electorate at once wearied, hard-pressed and volatile cannot be known or even properly estimated.</p>

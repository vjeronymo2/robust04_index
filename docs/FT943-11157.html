			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Signal staff offered payments to break rail strike Some railway signalling staff have been offered one-off payments of between Pounds 750 and Pounds 800 to work during this week's 24-hour rail strike planned to run from noon on Wednesday to noon on Thursday. The RMT transport union said yesterday that local managers had made the offer to individual signal workers in the south-west of England and East Anglia on instructions from Railtrack, the state-owned company responsible for running the network. A spokeswoman for Railtrack denied that the company had authorised the offer. But she said managers in the south-west had taken their own initiative without authorisation and canvassed signalling staff on whether they would accept a lump sum of Pounds 800, the amount they could expect immediately the current dispute is resolved. The figure is made up of a 2.5 per cent basic pay increase backdated to April, a Pounds 250 lump sum for accepting credit transfer of wages and a 6 per cent increase in pay as an unconsolidated supplement. It was unclear last night whether Railtrack would extend this offer to the rest of the company's signal staff. The RMT said the offer was conditional on the signalling grades working on the strike days until negotiations had produced a settlement of the seven-week dispute. 'I thought I could no longer be astonished by the antics of Railtrack in this dispute but this must take the prize for stupidity,' said RMT general secretary Mr Jimmy Knapp. 'Railtrack are offering individuals Pounds 800 to try and break the strike when putting the money on the negotiating table will go a long way to resolving the dispute.' Mr Knapp suggested that Railtrack's offer indicated that money was 'clearly not a problem' for Railtrack. 'Once again, I invite Railtrack to get around the negotiating table and start looking afresh at ways of resolving this dispute,' he said. Railtrack said last night it believed that there would be a larger number of signalling staff going to work in defiance of this week's strike. Last week, one in seven of the signal staff worked normally during the 48 hours of disruption. A Railtrack spokesman said, however, that the company was 'not very optimistic' about an early resumption of formal negotiations with the RMT. Acas, the arbitration service, is expected to make further efforts today to find common ground to bring the two sides together for further talks.</p>

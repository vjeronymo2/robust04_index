			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Slow death by a thousand rumours of resignation: Why Russia's foreign minister has been hurt, perhaps fatally, by a campaign of denigration THE FOREIGN policy of Russia is being conducted by a man who has been injured, it may be fatally, by a campaign of denigration and hostility which has gone so far as to threaten the effectiveness of his actions. Mr Andrei Kozyrev is increasingly cut out of the important decisions which confront the Russian state in the world. Most recently, he suffered the public snub of seeing Mr Mikhail Poltoranin, a vice premier and a confidant of Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, going to Japan to prepare the way for Mr Yeltsin's trip there next month. Mr Kozyrev has played little part in arranging the truces - still more or less holding - in the hot spots around the Russian borders. He seems to have no special relationship with Mr Yeltsin and has been unable to find a reliable base in the parliament - whose more active members are pursuing their own international agendas. He has succeeded in retaining his position for now - but it hangs by a string held by the Russian president. There are many in the foreign diplomatic community who fault Mr Kozyrev on grounds of style and tactics. He has never defined a foreign policy, saying only that 'the essence of the concept . . . is to create a favourable environment for the transformation of Russia' - hardly a help to foreign governments trying to discern a pattern. He has been frenetic in his travelling, as yet to no great purpose. The attacks on him are not motivated by a desire to replace him with someone diplomatically or strategically more effective. The main reason for his slow death by a thousand rumours of resignation is that he is out of fashion: he tries to continue a pro-western liberal tradition which had been all the rage in government until a few months ago - but is now on the wane. Mr Vitaly Tretyakov, editor of the Nezavisimaya Gazeta (the daily voice of Moscow's intelligentsia) wrote in a front page editorial column last month that, were Mr Kozyrev to be forced into resignation, then the only liberals left in government would be the few clustered round Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting prime minister. It was all quite different when Mr Kozyrev took over the Russian foreign ministry over a year ago. Then, his rhetoric was based on the assumption that the collapse of Soviet structures would inevitably give the new states the opportunity to advance rational and pacific relations with the rest of the world. 'Our task,' he said in an interview last December, as the Soviet Union collapsed, 'is, as Andrei Sakharov once said, not to be buried under the rubble of a decomposing empire . . . . I think that such a threat is more distant now than before'. Less than four months later these words were hollow: the congress of Russian peoples' deputies, meeting in April, saw him as a traitor prepared to sell Russian interests - and Russian people - to placate the resurgent nationalisms in what had been subject races. The congress forced him on the defensive: yet he did not drop his fundamental positions. The congress made him aware that distrust of him stretched beyond the ranks of the ultra-nationalists and the former Communists, who had made common cause. His former democrat allies saw him as vacillating: a motion produced at the congress demanding the return of the Crimea from Ukrainian to Russian control was framed by radical democrats. 'What these super patriots are trying to do,' said Mr Kozyrev, 'is again to make everything a matter of ideology. It's the old Bolshevik mentality: they try to depict me as an enemy of the people, a traitor to the county. 'That's why they hate my foreign policy so much: for 70 years we could point to someone and say - there's the enemy - and I am trying to change all that . . . but I am pessimistic . . . I think sooner or later we will have a confrontation on foreign policy'. The confrontation is now upon him, its emotive power drawn from the plight of Russians outside the Russian borders. In the self-declared TransDnestrian Republic in Moldova, the majority Slavs came under the attack of the Moldovan army (a fragile ceasefire has been kept). In all of the Baltic states, Russians are being treated as second-class citizens, and tension is rising (particularly in Estonia, where a firefight broke out at the end of July between Russian and Estonian soldiers). As Mr Yeltsin's trip to Japan gets closer, there are accusations that the foreign office is preparing a sell-out on the Kurile Islands consigning Russians to Japan or forcing them off their island homes. Japan is energetically reclaiming the four islands, seized by Russia at the end of the last war. Mr Kozyrev, trying to keep going civilised discussion, found himself under yet more ferocious attack - including from one-time liberals such as Mr Sergei Stankevich, a Yeltsin adviser and Mr Oleg Rumyantsev, head of the Social Democratic party. Goaded, the foreign minister himself lashed out - in an interview with the daily paper Izvestia. 'The party of war is rearing its head in our country. Why are the military deciding on all major political questions? I think that the threat of an anti-democratic coup does exist.' Days later, a collection of generals and colonels from the military and security forces denounced Mr Kozyrev for daring to suggest that they would act undemocratically. He survived that, but barely. He continues to plan his calendar for the autumn and later like a man with a future ahead of him. But he must know it is a highly conditional future - conditional on the outcome of a struggle for power, and for influence with the president, within the Russian leadership which daily grows more intense.</p>

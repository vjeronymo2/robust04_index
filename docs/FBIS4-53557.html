			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii by NHK </F> announcer Yoshiaki Kawabata; place and date not given; from the  "NHK News 7" program]    [Text] [Kawabata] The Hata administration is a minority  government. Do you think that this will have some negative  impact on approval of the fiscal 1994 budget? Also, do you  think you can count on cooperation from the Social Democratic  Party of Japan [SDPJ], which seceded from the coalition  government?    [Fujii] At the least, we worked together to form the budget.  We had ministerial level discussions with former cabinet members  of the SDPJ. I believe that they share the same views with us.  Therefore, I will talk to them and do my best to ask for their  cooperation.    [Kawabata] Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] President Yohei  Kono said that passage of the budget modification should be  carried out when necessary. What do you think about his  statement?    [Fujii] The LDP is the largest opposition party, so, we  should listen carefully to his comments. At the same time, we  will explain the rationale behind the budget in more detail to  increase their understanding.    [Kawbata] The provisional budget will expire next week.  What do you think about the supplementary budget?    [Fujii] As of today, we want to have budget discussions in  the Diet as soon as possible. However, in practice, I know we  need to think about a supplementary budget because funds are  needed immediately. In fact, the mechanism for a supplementary  budget ends with the provisional budget. However, I am not in a  position to announce the decision. We will see how the  discussions will proceed before we make the final decision.    [Kawabata] Another major task for the administration is tax  reform. Now that the SDPJ has gone, I wonder how the finance  minister will cope with the issue. Have you changed your  policies since the split with the SDPJ?    [Fujii] The basic policy remains unchanged from the previous  cabinet. I think that the Tax System Research Council's  recommendations are also unchanged. We need to think how we can  financially support our future welfare society. Now we have a  progressive tax system, which has already reached its limit when  compared to other countries. At the moment, taxation is  concentrated on income tax and salaried workers, in particular,  shoulder the burden. Now, we need to have broader taxation of  lower percentages. For instance, more consumption tax to  increase revenues to support welfare. I believe this will  benefit both tax payers and those who receive social services.    [Kawabata] Howe do you foster good public understanding on  such matters?    [Fujii] Of course, such matters require the consensus of the  people and agreement in parliament. This is the most important  point. Therefore, we need to publicize and promote the concept  at the same time. When I was deputy finance minister 13 years  ago, we launched a nationwide treasury campaign. We need to  talk to financial business people as well as to explain the  concept to the public.    [Kawabata] What about the review of the consumption tax?    [Fujii] This issue has been taken up in the Tax System  Research Council for discussions. Many people are discussing  the possibility of reviewing the system. A simplified tax  system, duty free shops, tax exemption limits, and other matters  need to be reviewed. The final decision should be made based on  that review. Anyway, discussions ought to take place.    [Kawabata] Do you think it will be possible for the tax  reform bills to be passed during the current Diet session?    [Fujii] The government's tax reform platform says that the  reform should be implemented by the end of this year. The  governing coalition agreed to make the final decision in June.  That schedule has not been changed. The cabinet decided to  carry out tax reform this year. I cannot say about ongoing  discussions among the political parties. But, I understand that  they have a schedule in their minds as well.    [Kawabata] You think it is essential for the tax reform  bills to pass parliament in June. But, is this possible?    [Fujii] The coalition continues its discussions to meet that  timeframe. The Finance Ministry is also doing all it can to  conform to the schedule.</p>

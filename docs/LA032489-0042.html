			<p><P> March 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOUSE, DEFYING VETO THREATS, OKS WAGE BILL  </P> <P> The House, defying threats of a presidential veto, voted Thursday to raise the  federal minimum wage from $3.35 an hour to $4.55 by late 1991, 30 cents higher  than President Bush has said he would accept.  </P> <P> Congressional leaders said that the vote, 248 to 171, is likely to spur the  Senate into approving an even higher minimum wage -- possibly $4.65 an hour, as  Senate Democrats have proposed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Backs 'Training' Pay  </P> <P> Nevertheless, the vote is substantially short of the two-thirds' majority that  would be needed to override a veto. And the House bill would allow a subminimum  "training" wage -- 85% of the prevailing minimum wage -- only for a worker's  first two months on a job, less than the six months sought by Bush.  </P> <P> "The President's position is firm . . . " Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said  Thursday. "We're hanging tough."  </P> <P> Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), chairman of the Senate Labor and Human  Resources Committee and the chief sponsor of the Senate bill, held out the  possibility that the Democrats might be open to further bargaining.  </P> <P> He urged Bush to "refrain from further veto threats until he sees the shape of  the bill that Congress finally sends him. This is an excellent opportunity for  Congress and the Administration to demonstrate that they can work together."  </P> <P> The $4.55-an-hour figure voted by the House was billed as a bipartisan  compromise. The House Education and Labor Committee originally had sought $4.65  but agreed to a 10-cent reduction to halt defections by conservative Democrats.  </P> <P> The House rejected, 218 to 198, the Administration's $4.25-an-hour proposal.  Before finally approving the bill, House members voted, 240 to 179, to approve  the $4.55 figure.  </P> <P> On final passage, 226 Democrats and 22 Republicans voted for the measure, while  147 Republicans and 24 Democrats opposed it. The California delegation  essentially split along party lines, with two exceptions: Rep. Charles Pashayan  Jr. (R-Fresno) voted for the compromise bill, and Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los  Angeles) did not vote.  </P> <P> The dispute over how much to increase the federal minimum wage is mainly a  political one. Economists say that the economic impact of a higher minimum wage  is likely to be modest because labor is already in such short supply that few  jobs are still paying the federal minimum.  </P> <P> And in some states -- such as California, where the minimum is $4.25 -- state  law already provides for a higher wage than federal law.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, the issue has become a major rallying point for Democrats and  organized labor. The federal minimum wage has not been increased since 1981.  </P> <P> On Thursday, Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.), urging House approval of the  compromise proposal, told lawmakers that "it isn't enough, but it certainly is  better than nothing. I'm asking you for this vote today . . . "  </P> <P> Bush has insisted on including a so-called "training" wage for new workers on  grounds that employers might cut back on hiring if they are forced to pay a  higher minimum wage to inexperienced workers. He wants the training wage to be  today's $3.35-an-hour minimum.  </P> <P> In addition to providing only a 60-day training period, the House-passed bill  would apply the training minimum only to new workers with no experience.  </P> <P> The full minimum wage would rise to $3.85 an hour on Oct. 1, $4.25 a year later  and $4.55 in October of 1991 -- a year before Bush's proposed $4.25 would go  into effect.  </P> <P> The compromise measure would also increase the number of businesses that are  exempt from having to pay the federal minimum wage. Currently, employers whose  gross earnings are less than $362,000 a year are exempt. The bill would raise  the figure to $500,000.  </P></p>

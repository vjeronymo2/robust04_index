			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Institutions and the search for non-executives Sir, It is understandable that questions should be raised over the quality of non-executive directors, with 84 per cent of institutional investors surveyed taking the view that non-executive directors are less effective than expected ('City slams 'low calibre' non-executive directors', July 4). What is more difficult to understand is why these institutional investors make such little use of their considerable voting strength as shareholders to remove lightweight non-executive directors and replace them with individuals of sufficient calibre.

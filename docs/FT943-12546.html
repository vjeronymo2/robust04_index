			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Executive pay bias narrows The salary gap between male and female executives is narrowing fast, says the latest quarterly survey by pay and benefit consultants Sedgwick Noble Lowndes. The survey also finds that the downward trend in executive pay rises has been reversed and that executive increases are now nearly 50 per cent higher than the rise in average earnings, which is 3.75 per cent. The news of the narrowing pay gap for women executives will be broadly welcomed, especially after recent figures showing that the number of women managers in Britain's top organisations is falling. Those figures, from the Institute of Management, showed that the proportion of female senior managers and directors had fallen from last year's 10.2 per cent to 9.5 per cent. The latest pay figures show that in the past 12 months the average increase in women's base salary was 5.4 per cent compared with 5 per cent for men. In the same period a year ago the average rise was 6 per cent for women compared with 5.4 per cent. The statistics, drawn from a database of 5,199 executives in 407 companies, show a consistent pattern over the past four years, with women receiving up to a fifth more - in relative terms - than men in their pay awards. But the gap remains wide. The average base salary for directors is Pounds 67,371 for men and Pounds 54,836 for women, a gap of 22.9 per cent.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------               PAY &amp; BENEFITS OF EXECUTIVES - JUNE 30 1994  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Package Rank of      Size of                  Salary    Bonuses     Company manager      company by                           etc.        car              annual sales             Pounds     Pounds      Pounds  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Chief        Up to Pounds100m:        106,528    16,080      15,612 executives   Pounds101m-Pounds600m:   177,477    22,127      16,291              Pounds600m-plus:         193,588    30,093      18,877 Other        Up to Pounds100m:         60,399     8,746       8,396 directors    Pounds101m-Pounds600m:   107,657    12,671      12,820              Pounds600m-plus:         120,606    14,583      13,566 Senior       Up to Pounds100m:         42,437     3,587       7,291 managers     Pounds101m-Pounds600m:    59,488     6,228       8,304              Pounds600m-plus:          73,895     6,233       9,248 Middle       Up to Pounds100m:         29,682     1,581       4,348 managers     Pounds101m-Pounds600m:    42,953     3,684       5,526              Pounds600m-plus:          46,495     3,525       6,346 All executives in survey:              62,315     6,797       8,827  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Rank of           Pension    Other       Total     Index    % rise manager                      perks        pay      (1/90    in last                   Pounds     Pounds     Pounds     =100)     year  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Chief             16,236      1,669    156,125     142.3     6.2% executives        25,532      1,736    243,163     147.7     5.6%                   28,999      2,020    273,577     147.7     5.7% Other              9,271        651     87,463     142.4     5.8% directors         14,311      1,614    149,074     146.2     6.2%                   18,993      1,829    169,577     146.3     6.7% Senior             4,998        485     58,798     140.1     5.9% managers           8,221        801     83,042     145.5     5.6%                   10,053      1,097    100,526     143.2     5.0% Middle             3,558        359     39,528     138.1     4.7% managers           6,417        837     59,417     143.5     4.7%                    6,602      1,129     64,097     143.3     5.2% All executives in survey:         9,268      1,068     88,275     144.9     6.0%  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Figures are averages from survey of 5,199 managers in 407 companies.

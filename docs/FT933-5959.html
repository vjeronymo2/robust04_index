			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / The Middle East: Shocked Palestinians question price of deal  -Arafat takes the biggest gamble of his life MR Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, the man who has consistently amazed enemies and followers alike with his ability to survive internal and external threats, is taking the biggest gamble of his life. By defying the opposition of segments of the Palestinian leadership to an historic agreement with Israel, Mr Arafat is putting at stake his credibility, his constituency and, perhaps, his life. At risk, many critics believe, may be the very survival of the PLO and a united Palestinian quest for what they consider their national rights. Mr Arafat's decision to do a deal with Israel without consulting either the main Palestinian decision-making bodies or other Arab participants to the peace talks, shows that he and his confidants have decided to take the Palestinian negotiations with Israel into their own hands. The PLO chairman has been under considerable pressure to accommodate Israeli demands, not only politically from some Arab states and the US but also by virtue of the PLO's ruinous financial state. Yet, according to some of his colleagues, rather than being concerned over concessions made, he is euphoric over having finally got the Israeli government to negotiate directly with the PLO. But in many Palestinian eyes, Mr Arafat is paying a dear price for attaining de facto Israeli recognition. It appears to entail his approval to postpone negotiations over the status of Jerusalem and Israeli settlements in the occupied territories. Two prominent members of the Palestinian delegation, Ms Hanan Ashrawi and Mr Saeb Erekat, indicated in statements yesterday in Washington that from now on the PLO should take complete responsibility for the consequences of its agreement with Israel. Privately, many members of the delegation - which was hand-picked by the PLO  -have repeatedly complained that Mr Arafat was not serious about the Washington negotiations, except as a vehicle to compel the Israelis to talk directly to the PLO, and for the US to resume its dialogue with the organisation. Such a view is gaining ground among Palestinian opponents who fear Mr Arafat could now be forced to accept Israeli conditions which would, in their view, strip from the PLO its historic role as the embodiment of Palestinian national rights. Such an argument highlights the difficulty inherent in Mr Arafat winning recognition. Central to this dilemma is Israel's apparent condition that the PLO modify the Palestinian Charter, which calls for the liberation of all the lands considered as Palestinian - a clause which has long been synonymous with a call for the destruction of Israel. To effect such changes, Mr Arafat would have to convene the Palestine National Council (PNC), the Palestinian parliament-in-exile, something which would, in turn, risk raising opposition within this broad body to any participation in the negotiating process. Other apparent Israeli conditions for recognition could prove stiffer still to enact: a public renunciation of armed struggle, and the dropping of demands for the repatriation and compensation of Palestinian refugees displaced in 1948. Mr Arafat is trying to sidestep the first condition by arguing that by renouncing terrorism, as the PLO did in 1988, and by joining the peace process, the PLO has already delivered this condition. But it far harder to see how the PLO could issue a statement abandoning the rights of the 1948 refugees in the Palestinian camps in Lebanon and Jordan.</p>

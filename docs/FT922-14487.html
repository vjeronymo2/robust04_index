			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Cash shortages force delay in launch of venture funds AMBITIOUS plans for a national network of regional venture capital funds have had to be scaled down because of difficulties in raising finance. The idea was initiated by Business in the Community, an umbrella organisation for Britain's local enterprise agencies, which asked Midland Bank to co-ordinate the setting up of 11 funds. The bank now hopes that two of the projected Midland Enterprise Funds - one in Yorkshire and another in the north of England - will be launched in May while a further two, also in the north, will follow in June or July. Plans for the other seven have been delayed until the fund-raising climate improves. Originally the aim was to raise a total of Pounds 55m to invest mainly in small established companies, but also in start-ups. Midland would raise Pounds 7m itself and seek the bulk of the rest from such sources as pension funds and local authorities. Although the planned total was relatively modest the setback to the network points to the continuing depth of the economic recession. There were difficulties in trying to raise finance in the south and east of England although money was more readily available in the north, said Mr David McMeekin, corporate finance director of Midland corporate banking. Each regional fund should have between Pounds 3m and Pounds 6m to invest in businesses in amounts ranging from Pounds 5,000 to Pounds 250,000. Local professional firms will advise entrepreneurs at rates up to 60 per cent cheaper than normal. Midland attributes its problems in the south-east to the lack of a well-defined regional identity and poll tax collection difficulties which have deprived many local authorities of cash to back the venture. The collapse of Bank of Credit &amp; Commerce International and the plundering of pension funds in Mr Robert Maxwell's business empire have made pension fund trustees wary of putting money into a project involving venture capital, which some trustees regard as a slightly unorthodox means of finance. Some potential investors were put off by the realisation that venture capital investments may not be as profitable as the industry forecast in the early 1980s. Finally, many companies backed away from the project because they have had to devote all their financial resources to surviving the recession. Difficulties in achieving a national spread of enterprise funds have meant that Midland has had to drop plans for 'a fund of funds', a unit trust which would have raised Pounds 7m centrally from institutions and then distributed it to the regional venture funds. The money raised until now has been returned to investors. This leaves the fund-raisers with the Pounds 7m committed to the venture by Midland Bank and a further Pounds 7m-Pounds 8m which has been raised from investors in the regions. 'It is very disappointing,' said Mr McMeekin. 'But we have built a support network of 700 professional firms in the regions and we are not going to throw that away. As companies come out of the recession they are going to need more capital and that has to be provided in some form.'</p>

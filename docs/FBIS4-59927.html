			<p>BFN     [Text] Residents of the Gaza Strip will be allowed to  enter the boundaries of Israel after presenting a special  certificate and undergoing a thorough security check. This  statement was made by Police Minister Moshe Shahal to our  correspondent Nisim Qeynan. Shahal added that responsibility for  guarding the Green Line between the Gaza Strip and Israel will  be handed over from the army to the Israel Police. In the next  few days, the police command will take charge of the Lakhish  region and the Southern Command's home front headquarters, thus  creating a continuous and uniform command. The minister noted  that within two weeks, he will announce the establishment of a  sixth police district to be in charge of the autonomy. The  police minister made the remarks during a tour of northern Gaza  Strip today.    Commissioner Asaf Hefetz, Israel Police commander, expects  no  special problems in conducting safe passage between the Gaza  Strip and Jericho. He expects tight cooperation between the  Israeli and the autonomy police forces. Today, Commissioner  Hefetz visited the Northern District for the first time since he  assumed duty as police chief. He told our correspondent in the  north Yo'av Aviv that he sees no change taking place on the  ground following Yasir 'Arafat's call for a jihad.</p>

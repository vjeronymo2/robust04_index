			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The labor unions, CATH [Autonomous Organization of  Haitian Workers], CGT [General Central of Workers], CTH  [Confederation of Haitian Workers], FOS [Federation of Workers  Trade Unions], OGITH [General and Independent Organization of  Haitian Workers], and KOTA [Confederation of Haitian Blue-Collar  Workers] protest the employers' initiative to stop work. The  labor union sectors see those arrangements as unilateral and the  coup de grace to the workers' organizations, which will become  organizations of unemployed people.    According to members of the labor unions, the employers'  associations want only to avoid their responsibilities in paying  the workers. The various labor unions are ready to meet with the  other sectors of national life to search for a solution to the  Haitian crisis.</p>

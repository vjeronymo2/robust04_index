			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Corporate disclosure The stock exchange set itself a difficult task with this week's guidelines on corporate disclosure. While it wants to see a strong flow of information from companies, it also wants to help them keep within the bounds of the new insider trading legislation. Since the now notorious LIG and Shanks &amp; McEwan cases, some companies have been frightened even to answer the phone to analysts. One purpose is to impress on them that it is all right to release information, provided it goes through the proper channels. The more information that there is in the public domain, the less insider trading is likely. Yet the guidelines bear the hallmarks of a committee of practitioners who secretly hanker after the status quo. There is little in them to force change on companies that have been using insider dealing worries as a reason for clamming up. The definition of what constitutes price-sensitive developments is inevitably vague. Companies are urged to report such developments even during the close season, but the exchange has no means of making them do so. The central point is that an urge to clamp down on the illicit use of information needs balancing with increased coercion on companies to disseminate information widely. The disclosure debate has brought positive developments, such as formal statements by retailers on Christmas trading. But a more structured approach may be required, which leaves companies less room for discretion in what they reveal. Quarterly reporting is a blunt instrument, but it need not require audited figures and can be a timely way of updating the market. It is a bullet which UK finance directors may yet need to bite.</p>

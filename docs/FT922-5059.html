			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / BT job loss move opposed THE MAIN union in BT, the telecommunications group, has voted not to co-operate with a scheme for redundant workers that would guarantee them three months' work after leaving the company. The annual conference of the NCU communications union voted to reject the scheme, fearing that it would lead to increased casual employment. BT hopes for 24,000 redundancies this year. Its scheme would provide leavers with a Pounds 1,000 training voucher and at least three months' work in the year after redundancy. The work would be arranged through Manpower and Skillbase employment agencies. BT says that although the idea of 'bridging' work before retirement or another job is not new, it has never been tried on such a scale for non-managerial staff. Those on the scheme would be employed by the agencies and receive at least 25 per cent of their last BT salary for the three months' work.</p>

			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Bank sounds warning on lack of investment Investment could be undermined by the high rates of return that companies are demanding on projects, the Bank of England has warned. The warning follows a report from the Confederation of British Industry last week which found that most companies had not adjusted their investment assessments to take account of the recent trend of low inflation. The Bank's warning, contained in an article in its quarterly bulletin, is based on an informal survey of 250 companies conducted in March and adds further weight to the CBI's findings. It notes that more than 70 per cent of businesses questioned had not reduced their target rates of return, while just 25 per cent had revised their investment appraisal techniques to take account of low inflation. The main reason, it says, is that most companies argued that investment decisions were affected by longer-term considerations, and saw 'little reason yet to adjust their longer-term expectations of inflation rates and the cost of capital'. These findings have prompted Mr Eddie George, Bank governor, to warn that companies are missing profitable investment opportunities by continuing to demand high rates of return. This view is disputed by many companies and analysts who argue that high rates of return are not the only factor holding back investment. However Mr Andrew Ward-low, head of the Bank's conjectural assessment and projections division, and author of the report, takes a more cautious line. Although companies' slowness to adjust their investment criterion may undermine investment in the future, it may not have been critical to investment when the survey was conducted in March, Mr Wardlow says. He adds: 'A further period of monetary stability may be needed before a more fundamental adjustment in behaviour becomes widespread.' The nominal rate of return on projects that companies are demanding - about 20 per cent according to the Bank's survey - was not previously unreasonable given that producer price inflation was running at an average of 9.5 per cent between 1970 and 1990, the report notes.

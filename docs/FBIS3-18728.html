"Our decisions were made in full accordance with the  applicable Community regulations," the ministry states. "If the  United States were to take retaliatory measures against France,  it would be responsible for escalating tensions at the very time  we are preparing the Marrakesh conference, which will make it  possible to sign the GATT agreements and create a world trade  organization. One might wonder whether that was a good signal  to send," the ministry added.    Yesterday, the United States officially threatened France  that it would take retaliatory measures against it as a result  of the severe sanitary controls applied by Paris on cargos of  American fish.    The American National Fisheries Institute estimated that  losses for American fishermen, whose products have been turned  back by the French health authorities since 5 February, total  1.2 million francs per week.    Agriculture and Fisheries Minister Jean Puech accused the  United States of exporting fish treated with a chemical  substance used to retain water, which is illegal in France and  throughout the European Union.</p>

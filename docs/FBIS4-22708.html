			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with A. Nesmeyanov, chairman of the Communists of </F> Maritime Kray electoral bloc coordinating council, by KRASNOYE  ZNAMYA correspondent Vitaliy Mogil; place and date not given:  "April Is Thesis Time"]    [Text] Kray communists were one of the political  forces objecting to the kray administration decision to move the  duma elections to the fall. Our KRASNOYE ZNAMYA correspondent  met with A. Nesmeyanov, chairman of the Communists of Maritime  Kray electoral bloc coordinating council.    [Mogil] Anatoliy Vladimirovich, it is well known that there  is no unity in the national and kray communist movement.  Nevertheless, members of different parties of a communist bent  are going into the elections to the kray duma and local  self-rule bodies as a bloc. What has prompted them to unite?    [Nesmeyanov] The stimulus for joining forces was our failure  at the elections to the State Duma, when the two largest party  organizations: the Communist Party of the Russian Federation and  the Russian Communist Workers Party--nominated their candidates  independently of one another and did not gather the needed  number of votes.    Now the Communists of Maritime Kray electoral bloc, in  addition to the aforementioned parties, includes the kray  organization of the VKPB [All-Russia Communist Party of  Bolsheviks] (I do not think the abbreviation needs expansion)  and the public movement in defense of V.I. Lenin.    [Mogil] Is the combined force being successful?    [Nesmeyanov] We think so. The stage of candidate nomination  and registration has been completed successfully. Of 39 kray  duma electoral districts, our candidates are registered in 21.  Registering so many candidates also has served another cause.  The communists have been able to break the information blockade  the mass media, especially television and radio, had placed on  us. Thanks to air time on radio and television set aside for  candidates' appearances, we have been able to tell people about  ourselves and our program.    [Mogil] Tell us then about the substance of your program.    [Nesmeyanov] The main goal of the communists has not  changed.  It is socioeconomic protection of the workers. I think that in  the current situation that exists in Maritime Kray we will find  voter support. Therefore, the kray administration's decision to  move the elections to the fall is not at all to our benefit.    [Mogil] Have you reconciled yourselves with it?    [Nesmeyanov] There is not much hope that we will be listened  to, but the Communists of Maritime Kray bloc sent a protest  against this decision to the kray administration, State Duma,  and Central Electoral Commission. As the governor's decree  states, the postponement of the elections was prompted by  "numerous requests from the administrations of kray cities and  rayons." This violates the democratic norms of separating the  executive and legislative branches of power--something the  current democrats were so intent on just recently. Today all the  levers of authority are concentrated in the hands of  administration heads and their staff, without any effective  oversight of them by the people. Such structures have the  coloration of dictatorship--and not faded at that--and once  again unmask the system of presidential authority, and its  inability to ensure free and truly democratic elections in  Russia.    Overall, we firmly oppose Yeltsin's reforms and,  consequently, the kray administration, which is the conduit of  these reforms in Maritime Kray. The communists are always open  to dialogue, however.    [Mogil] Still, if we assume that the elections will be held  in the fall...    [Nesmeyanov] We will continue our work. At a recent meeting  at which our candidates for deputy were present, they were  instructed to continue the election campaign and meet with the  people more.</p>

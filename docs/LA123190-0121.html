			<p><P> December 31, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> GORBACHEV TELLS OF ERRORS, HOPES  </P> <P> President Mikhail S. Gorbachev admitted today that serious errors had been  committed under his leadership but predicted that the Soviet people would see a  turning point in their fortunes in the coming year.  </P> <P> Gorbachev, in a New Year message broadcast just before midnight, described 1990  as "an exceptionally difficult year."  </P> <P> He said economic problems were inevitable in a vast country embarking on a  transition to a market economy.  </P> <P> "To this were added shortcomings and errors of even recent times -- errors by  the country's leadership, our common inadequacies," he said.  </P> <P> He demanded a commitment to hard work and discipline to halt a decline in  living standards. "However deep the crisis endured by our country, we can and  must achieve a turning point for the better . . . in the coming year,"  Gorbachev said.  </P></p>

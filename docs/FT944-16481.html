			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Survey of Bulgaria (4): Early vote called for / A look at the political crisis In October 1992 - when the anti-communist Union of Democratic Forces (UDF) government headed by Philip Dimitrov lost power and the country passed to the hands of a 'government of technocrats' headed by Lyuben Berov - believers in a smooth transition to democracy were dealt a sharp blow. Since then the Bulgarian politics has been essentially on hold. Mr Berov's government was supported by the parliamentary votes of the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), the renamed home of the former communists, as well as the Movement for Rights and Freedoms (MRF) which is supported by Bulgaria's ethnic Turkish minority and, sporadically, by the splinter groups which have hived off from the two rival mainstream groups, the BSP and the UDF over the past two years of political drift and disillusionment. Mr Berov held on to power long enough to oversee the successful conclusion of debt reduction negotiations with the Paris and London clubs of creditors. But the 69-year-old former professor, who recovered well from a heart attack in March, felt increasingly isolated from an electorate frustrated by lack of progress in building the institutions of a market economy and threatened by rising criminality. He survived six no-confidence votes tabled by the UDF over the past 12 months and resigned at the start of September. Zhelyu Zhelev, the president, immediately began negotiations with the two main political groupings, but they declined his offer to try and form a new government. Both parties have been calling for early elections, although a large number of individual deputies, doubting their chances of re-election and anxious to secure their pension and other privileges, privately express reluctance to go to the polls before the current parliamentary terms ends in October 1995. Some BSP leaders are also reluctant to assume power and responsibility while many acute social, economic and political problems remain unsolved. But the BSP's insistence that early elections are preferable to another interim government chosen by the president has more conviction than that of the UDF because opinion polls indicate that an early vote would bring the BSP back to power, albeit without the overall majority needed to govern alone. This prospect is deeply distasteful to President Zhelev who began his political career as one of the leaders of the UDF but disagreed with the policies and tactics pursued by Mr Dimitrov and ended as a critic of both leading parties. In return the president, who now comes in second place behind the exiled King Simeon in public opinion polls, is criticised for his 'byzantine' behind-the-scenes manoeuverings which in recent weeks included meetings with top military leaders to ensure their loyalty and impartiality in the tense months which lie ahead. The partial disintegration of the UDF, an umbrella organisation which originated as a loose anti-communist coalition of nearly 20 groups and emerged as the largest political force in the 1991 elections, left the BSP as the largest single party in the present parliament. The BSP has also suffered defections but still holds 99 of the 240 seats in the Narodno Sobranie, the People's Assembly, against only 78 for the UDF. A further 19 seats are held by the ethnic Turk MRF with the remainder split between two smaller groups, New Choice, a handful of liberal conservatives headed by Dimiter Ludzhev and the Democratic Alternative for the Republic (DAR) a small centre-left party, plus about 20 independent, non-party MPs. The refusal of the two major parties to form a government in succession to Mr Berov obliged President Zhelev to make one final effort to comply with his constitutional duty by calling on Mr Ludzhev, the leader of 'New Choice' to try his luck. The New Choice leader has been a close friend and ally of the president for the past 15 years. At the time of writing the outcome of his effort to form a government was not known, but the most likely conclusion to the crisis appeared to be new elections before Christmas, or possibly early in the new year.</p>

			<p><P> April 10, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 600 IMMIGRANTS RUSH TO INS OFFICE;  </P> <P> AMNESTY: A SHORTAGE OF TEMPORARY WORK CARDS TRIGGERS THE FALSE RUMOR OF A  DEADLINE FOR APPLYING FOR LEGAL RESIDENCE. POLICE OFFICERS ARE CALLED IN TO  CONTROL THE CROWD.  </P> <P> More than 600 immigrants flooded an Immigration and Naturalization Service  office in Sepulveda Monday morning, mistakenly believing a rumor that today was  the deadline to apply for legal residence status under the amnesty program.  </P> <P> The rumor apparently started Wednesday afternoon when the San Fernando  Legalization Office on Parthenia Street ran out of the temporary work  authorization cards issued to illegal aliens who have applied for residency  under amnesty programs.  </P> <P> Because they could not issue work cards, the office stopped accepting amnesty  applications and told prospective applicants to return this week. The office  continued to turn away applicants last Thursday and Friday, said Richard  Walden, chief legalization officer of the Northridge Amnesty Office.  </P> <P> "All the people who had been turned away became concerned that the program was  about to end," Walden said. "It was a wildfire rumor that got out. Word got  around the community quickly. The rumor mill works very effectively."  </P> <P> Divided in language but united in their confusion and desire for a green card,  sari-clad women, turbaned men, immigrants in work clothes and others in suits  milled around the parking lot.  </P> <P> Inside the office, staff members processed the applications of about 170 people  who had been allowed inside while six police officers, speaking with the aid of  the loudspeakers on their patrol cars, urged the rest of the crowd to leave and  return another day.  </P> <P> An immigration lawyer stood amid the crowd, repeating that the program was not  closing and warning those in line that immigration officers might deport them  if they did not leave immediately.  </P> <P> Although the original amnesty program established by the federal government was  scheduled to end in May, 1988, it has been extended by court rulings that found  the initial eligibility requirements too strict.  </P> <P> Those court rulings are being appealed by the INS, and until the issues are  completely litigated, amnesty offices must continue accepting applications for  amnesty, Walden said.  </P> <P> The shortage of the work cards stems from an increasing number of aliens  applying for amnesty to get work permits -- and some "bureaucratic snafus,"  Walden said.  </P> <P> Last fall, the San Fernando office processed about 15 applicants a day, but now  about 300 people a day come to apply.  </P> <P> The surge in applicants is probably caused by an increasing awareness about the  court-ordered extension and by a growing number of people who realize they can  get temporary work permits just by filling in a minimal amnesty application,  Walden said.  </P> <P> Polaroid supplies blank work authorization cards, upon which immigration  officials affix the photograph of the applicants who show the cards to  employers as a form of identification and proof of their right to work.  </P> <P> Walden said he ordered more cards in January but was told that the company had  stopped producing them, thinking the amnesty program had ended.  </P> <P> As his supply ran lower, Walden said, he contacted the regional INS office and  asked officials to locate extras from other offices.  </P> <P> A spare box of 1,700 cards was located early last week in Stockton, but a clerk  there -- ordered to dispatch them to Northridge by overnight mail --  accidentally sent them through the regular postal service.  </P> <P> The cards arrived from Stockton Monday afternoon.  </P></p>

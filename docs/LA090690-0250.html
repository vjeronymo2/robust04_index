			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CHANGING THEIR WAYS;  </P> <P> EASTWOOD PULLING AWAY FROM ROLES THAT MADE HIS CAREER  </P> <P> In a movie career spanning 35 years, Clint Eastwood has played a host of  tough-guy characters ranging from gunfighter to cop, from mountain climber to  jet pilot.  </P> <P> But the craggy-faced actor and director has branched out in recent years toward  more artistic projects.  </P> <P> "I'd like to reach out and do a lot of things. I think that keeps you healthy,  keeps you analyzing films," said Eastwood, whose nearly 20-year directing  career is the subject of a three-week retrospective at the Walker Art Center.  </P> <P> "It's better for me. If I'd just done genre films -- detectives and Westerns --  when I started back in '64, I could be pretty self-bored by now. I'd probably  be retired by now."  </P> <P> His latest film, "White Hunter, Black Heart," explores the obsession of a movie  director bent on bagging an elephant in Africa.  </P> <P> The need for change may be why Eastwood said Wednesday that he plans no more  sequels to his popular "Dirty Harry" movies.  </P> <P> "I don't know where you'd take him," said Eastwood, who has starred in five  "Dirty Harry" pictures, starting in 1971.  </P> <P> "The Dead Pool," his last film about the San Francisco police detective who  taunted bad guys to "make my day," was released in 1988.  </P> <P> "The very dangerous thing about doing sequels is you can fall into a pattern of  self-imitation. You'd have to have an awfully good script to take you away from  that," he said.  </P></p>

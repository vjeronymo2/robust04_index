			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Relief and cheers at winning dockyard WORK at Devonport dockyard in Plymouth, on the banks of the Tamar between Devon and Cornwall, had virtually stopped by 3.30pm yesterday as hundreds of the 5,000 workers gathered in baking sunshine to listen to the defence secretary's Commons statement on the Trident refitting contract. The management of Devonport Management Ltd, the consortium which runs the 300-acre yard, had set up a public address system at Albert Gate, outside the 10-storey administrative block, dwarfed by the three hangar-like sheds of the frigate complex. At first, Mr Malcolm Rifkind's statement was heard in tense silence, except for a scattering of applause when he described Rosyth's last-minute cut-price bid as 'quite unreasonable.' Yesterday's Western Morning News had trumpeted 'All set for Trident triumph', but it was only when Mr Rifkind said Devonport's total costs were Pounds 64m less than Rosyth's that the workers knew the contract must be clinched. When Mr Rifkind confirmed this was the case, the rest of his words were drowned by jubilant cheers. Blue hard hats were waved in the air and the yard's hooter was sounded. A placard was waved saying 'Devonport simply the best'. Mr Mike Leece, the managing director of DML, stepped forward to as big a cheer as any manager could ever hope to receive from his workforce. But he warned that the yard had to deliver continuous improvements and compete for the refitting of every surface ship. Even with the Trident work there are likely to be more redundancies - he referred to the 6,500 that had gone in recent years. He added: 'We send our thoughts to the people in Rosyth.' Managers and workers took no pleasure in Rosyth's defeat. Mr Pete Saunders, an electrician, said: 'It has taken a year to decide the blatantly obvious. If it had gone to Rosyth that would have been purely political.' Mr Gordon Dyer, a maintenance worker, prepared to celebrate in traditional fashion. 'We will be going to the pub - it's the best place, isn't it?' The nearest pub to Albert Gate is The Complex, just one of the 600 south-west businesses which supply the Devonport complex and which stood to lose if the Trident contract had gone to Rosyth. There will also be relief among the 12 Tory MPs in Devon and Cornwall. Labour won Devonport at the last election, but the two other Plymouth seats are held by Conservatives, one by only 2,013 votes.</p>

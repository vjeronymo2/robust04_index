			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Investing for Growth): Biotechnology Investments Biotechnology Investments Limited (BIL) is an offshore investment company run by the experienced Jeremy Curnock-Cook of Rothschild Asset Management. The shares are at their lowest for 18 months, in spite of a decent relative performance against the weak US biotech sector, in which the company has most of its cash invested. Investors should see BIL as a way into the world of biotech. Sixty per cent of its cash is in some of the 1,500 or so US companies. In the UK, it has a large stake only in Cantab. While the other companies here are to be found under 'pharmaceuticals' in the FT share price listings, BIL is called Biotech Pref and is listed in the investment companies section.</p>

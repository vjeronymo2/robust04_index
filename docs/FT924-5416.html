			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / International Company News: Wang's Dollars 356.6m loss worse than forecast WANG Laboratories , the office computer systems manufacturer, issued its final results for fiscal 1992 which had been delayed by its bankruptcy protection filing in August. Restated net losses for the year were Dollars 356.6m, or Dollars 2.10 per share, much higher than the preliminary estimate of Dollars 139.2m issued in August. Restructuring costs and other extraordinary items resulted in charges against earnings of Dollars 277.3m. The results compare with a net loss of Dollars 385.5m, or Dollars 2.31, for fiscal 1991, which included restructuring charges of Dollars 444.8m. Revenues for 1992 slipped to Dollars 1.9bn from Dollars 2.1bn. Wang said its protection under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code enabled it take certain restructuring actions and accelerate others that would not have been possible under normal conditions. The 1992 restructuring charges included Dollars 123m for asset write-downs, Dollars 36m for abandonment of facilities, Dollars 65m for employee termination costs, Dollars 37m for the disposal of certain sales and manufacturing subsidiaries and Dollars 49m for various other restructuring actions. Fourth-quarter losses, as expected, were heavy, totalling Dollars 333.7m, or Dollars 1.96 per share - after restructuring and other charges of Dollars 306.7m - compared with Dollars 314.5m, or Dollars 1.88, a year ago. Revenues were Dollars 473.6m, down from Dollars 491.9m.</p>

			<p>Regulations   <F P=102>   PA0206011894 Panama City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish  2300 GMT 1 Jun 94 </F>  <F P=103> PA0206011894 </F> <F P=104>  Panama City Circuito RPC Television </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Alvaro Alvarado from the "RPC Television News" </F> newscast]    [Text] National Banking Commission [CBN] representatives  have indicated that the CBN is still unaware of any specific  measures the U.S. Government intends to take in terms of banking  secrecy in Latin America. A proposal to implement such measures  was mentioned during a recent meeting between representatives of  the U.S. Government and the Andean Group member-states--namely,  Ecuador, Venezuela, and Colombia. The U.S. plan is designed to  get Latin American nations to allow the United States to conduct  all types of investigations into regional banking matters.    Meanwhile, CBN President Olga Arosemena de Guizado has  indicated that current banking secrecy regulations in Panama do  not pose any obstacles to such investigations.    [Begin Arosemena de Guizado recording] At this time, any  duly  authorized representative of a foreign government can come to  Panama and officially request, through the relevant national  authorities, an investigation into any crime without having to  breach so-called banking secrecy rules. [end recording]    Unfortunately, according to the CBN president, any bank in  Latin America can be used to launder money. The CBN is  currently installing modern computer equipment that will allow  it to better monitor deposits made in the country's banks.    [Begin recording] [Arosemena de Guizado] What we could have  is a client who would go to one bank and deposit 5,000 [currency  not specified], and then go to another and deposit another  5,000, and so on, and so on.    [Alvarado] [Words indistinct]    [Arosemena de Guizado] In such a case, we would never know  for sure whether this company is the same one that deposited the  same amount in another bank. These kinds of situations could  take place. [end recording]    The modern computer equipment currently being installed was  donated by U.S. AID at a cost of $100,000.</p>

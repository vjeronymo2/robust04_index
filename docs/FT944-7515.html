			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Leading Article: The markets out of sorts This week's giddy slide on Wall Street, which has precipitated sharp falls in stock markets around the world, was surprising chiefly for its late arrival. US equities have long looked fully valued and their resistance to the pull of rising bond yields over the past 12 months had all the appearance of financial levitation. That impression was reinforced by equity investors' insouciant response to the tightening of US monetary policy since February. Whatever happens in the short run, it is hard to believe that stock prices can return to peak levels in a hurry. The more pressing question is whether the slide will accelerate. The starting point for any assessment must be the peculiarity of an economic cycle in which securities markets have been heavily distorted by the efforts of the US Federal Reserve to prevent a debt crisis turning into a credit crunch. The means employed by the Fed to achieve this end was to maintain a steep yield curve: short-term interest rates were kept low for an abnormally long period relative to bond rates. Banks were thereby encouraged to borrow cheaply to invest in higher yielding government IOUs. The resulting profits helped restore their capital base, permitting them to finance the economic recovery. Mutual funds The strength of the recovery is a measure of the success of the Fed's earlier policy. Yet one important consequence of that policy was that savers removed money from low-yielding bank deposit accounts and certificates of deposits, and put them into bond and equity mutual funds, which offered either a higher income or the prospect of capital growth. By last year the mutual fund industry had acquired Dollars 670bn of equities and Dollars 760bn of bonds, in addition to its money market fund holdings of Dollars 580bn. Together these funds of nearly Dollars 2,000bn were equivalent to about 85 per cent of all US bank deposits, against only 10 per cent in the early 1980s. The bond market collapse which followed the Fed's decision to start tightening policy in February has already caused the flow of money into bond mutual funds to dry up. The flow into equities has so far merely slowed down. Yet the recent successive rises in US short-term rates point towards lower equity valuations and a shift of mutual fund equity money back into bonds and deposits. Both in the US and across the world, economic recovery has proved far stronger this year than most forecasters expected. That is one reason why bond markets have worried about resurgent inflation and a rising cost of capital, and why the Fed has been forced to take remedial action. The price to be paid for pre-empting a further outbreak of inflation is a more pedestrian growth rate next year. Corporate profits will inevitably take a knock. Gloomy story The best reason for thinking that the present correction is not the end of the gloomy story is the current pattern of returns in the financial markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has been yielding less than 3 per cent while two-year government paper offers well over 7 per cent, and 10-year bonds offer nearly 8 per cent. The inflation-adjusted real rate of interest is exceptionally high by historic standards. Its attractions for investors are bolstered by Fed policy, which the futures markets expect to become tougher still. Meantime money is flowing back into bank deposits. The distortions wrought by the excessive accumulation of debt in the 1980s are beginning to unwind. The process nonetheless has a long way to go. For the rest of the world's markets, that points to an unstable climate for equities, since they cannot escape some backwash from Wall Street, even if their domestic economies are at an earlier stage in the recovery cycle. Yet the fall in prices could still prove beneficial if it helps free a flow of international capital that has been disrupted by the weakness of the dollar. Having lost billions on dollar bond holdings since the mid-1980s, Japanese investors have been dollar shy. Their absence from US Treasury bonds has contributed to higher real long-term interest rates. The fall in bond and equity prices on Wall Street does at least help restore the competitiveness of US assets by making them look cheaper to international investors, paving the way for the much needed stabilisation of the dollar.</p>

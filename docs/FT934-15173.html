			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Germany approves Maastricht: Court decision clears way for treaty to become law in November THE GERMAN federal constitutional court yesterday cleared away the last legal obstacle to the ratification of the Maastricht treaty on European union. The court's ruling was greeted with relief in European capitals, allaying fears that the German judicial authorities might impose conditions incompatible with the treaty which is set to become European law from November 1. The court in Karlsruhe rejected the challenges to the treaty as either inadmissible or unsubstantiated, in a fundamental decision defining Germany's future attitude to European integration. Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, said ratification of the Maastricht treaty would end a long period of uncertainty for the EC. But he warned: 'We cannot forget that the preoccupation of Europe today remains the recession and the growth in unemployment.' Mr Delors avoided any note of triumphalism, a reflection of how divisive the ratification battles have been in Denmark, France, the UK and, latterly, Germany since the treaty was signed in December 1991. 'If we continue like this, failing to recognise the benefits of a European construction, losing our ideals and the will to achieve them . . . we will be marginalised,' Mr Delors, one of Maastricht's architects, said in an interview on German ZDF television. 'We must stop splitting hairs, being morose . . . we must resume moving forward,' he said. Within hours, the German ratification law had been signed by President Richard von Weizsacker, and was dispatched last night by diplomatic courier to be deposited in Rome. The decision was welcomed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who had staked his political reputation on the treaty and the European integration process. He said it was now urgent to proceed with the programme set out in the treaty. Belgium, president of the EC, announced that the planned special summit on October 29 would go ahead. Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, Belgian prime minister, said the meeting would put into force the treaty's provisions covering the second phase of European economic and monetary union; common security and foreign policy; and co-operation on crime and justice matters. EC leaders will try to reach a summit deal on the site of the European Monetary Institute, the precursor of the European Central Bank, as well as other sites such as the European environmental agency and Europol. Germany remains the leading candidate for the EMI, with Amsterdam staging a late bid. The eight German judges decided that the process of European union did not conflict with the principles of democracy enshrined in the German constitution, thanks to national democratic controls implicit in the Maastricht treaty.

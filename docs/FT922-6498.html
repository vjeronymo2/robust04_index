			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Midland lifted by referral THE mid-afternoon news that the UK Monopolies and Mergers Commission was to investigate the Pounds 3.7bn conditional bid from Lloyds Bank for the Midland, leaving the way clear for the success of the rival bid from the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank, boosted trade in the latter and caused the former to go into retreat. The news helped Midland move 6 higher to 405p, on healthy turnover of 5m shares, while the setback left Lloyds 4 lighter at 226p. While the view still holds in some quarters that the HSBC offer should win the day, one explanation for yesterday's rise in the Midland share price was the view, gaining ground, that Lloyds is likely to fight on. Talk in the market has Lloyds possibly launching a formal bid at a higher price, or going into the market and bidding aggressively for Midland shares. One analyst said: 'Lloyds is unlikely to take this lying down. Too much management time has been spent to leave it at this.' Vodafone surges Dismissing the notion of a major price war between the two main cellular operators, US securities house Salomon Brothers yesterday reiterated its strong buy recommendation on Vodafone, sending the shares forward in busy trading. The shares were helped by a stock shortage which traders said had been building up all week. The Salomon move came after it had held discussions with Vodafone and BT, owner of Cellnet. The securities house concluded that any price competition would be limited to the M25 corridor, and that nationally the businesses would not clash. Vodafone shares rose 12 to 389p, helped by strong US buying, with 6.6m traded. BT, basking in the glow of its well-received results on Thursday, saw the fully-paid advance 6 1/2 to 366 1/2 p, and the partly-paid 6 to 144 1/2 p, with 12m and 23.6m traded respectively. Comments made by the SmithKline Beecham chairman to a conference in London on Thursday regarding prospects for a number of the group's drugs were well received in the market, the shares jumping 20 to 890p. Mr Bob Bauman told a healthcare seminar at Lehman Brothers that the outlook for three of SmithKline's new products was encouraging. Relafen, an arthritis drug, had taken a 5.6 per cent market share in the US after only two months. Anti-depressant Seroxat had grabbed a 15 per cent market shares since its arrival in the UK earlier this year, and Kytril had just been launched in Japan and was well-placed to take a large stake in the anti-nausea market. The positive sentiment lifted Glaxo, the shares rising 13 to 759p. A strong oil sector was underpinned by the Opec meeting and a firmer crude price. British Gas rose 4 1/2 to 250 1/2 p, Enterprise Oil 5 to 422p and Shell 5 to 507p. After its recent battering, Lasmo bounced back, the shares rising 7 to 199p. They were helped by news that the oil group had disposed of shares in its Canadian subsidiary, netting Lasmo CDollars 38m. BP settled 3 up at 262p, after 264p on relatively good turnover of 8.9m shares. Towards the close of trading the Kuwait Investment Office (KIO) said it had no plans to sell its 9.98 per cent stake in BP. BP shares raced higher in midweek as stories circulated that Hanson was about to buy the KIO stake at a price well ahead of the current market level. Old hands in the market described the story as 'no more than an old-fashioned ramp.' In the rest of the banking sector, TSB which until the Lloyds/ Midland news had gone into retreat, bounced on speculation that Lloyds could turn its attentions to TSB should its attempts to acquire the Midland meet with failure. The shares firmed 2 1/2 to 150 1/2 p. The uncertainity about the level of losses the bank could face following the Bombay financial debacle continued to cast a cloud over Standard Chartered. The shares gave up another 7 to 504p. SG Warburg firmed 4 to 601p, ahead of figures next week. Reratings in BTR and Williams Holdings by broker Smith New Court sent the shares falling. BTR closed 3 off at 496p, while Williams retreated 6 to 348p, after Smith moved the shares from a buy to a hold. Mr Bruce Davidson at Smith New Court said: 'The multiple of the two is similar and on our projections are at about a 5 per cent premium to the market this year. When compared with cyclical sectors the shares are not on a cheap rating.' Smith also had a look at Tomkins and reiterated its current stance that the shares had ran ahead. The shares closed 6 lighter at 502p. An upbeat annual meeting boosted Cookson Group, and the shares firmed 5 to 165p. General profit-taking coupled with caution about financial stocks from broker SG Warburg led to falls in a number of insurance related stocks. These included Legal and General, 5 lighter at 410p, and Prudential, 5 easier at 263p. Stores were active as brokers took the opportunity to reflect on the sector in the light of recent results. Nomura decided it liked Marks &amp; Spencer citing the group's sales growth potential and falling cost base. The house has also been advising clients to switch out of food retailers, for which it predicts continued weakness, and into the stores sector. Marks shares leapt 6 to 345p. Kleinworth Benson reiterated its buy stance on Kingfisher, considering the stock to have been left behind of late. The shares rose 12 to 575p. Credit Lyonnais Laing was also reported to have turned negative on Great Universal Stores, off 21 at 1534p. By far the biggest turnover of the day was in Brown and Jackson, as the company EGM approved a re-capitalisation of the Poundstretcher stores group, and other measures to ensure a firmer financial footing. The shares closed unchanged at 10 1/4 p. The decision to reform the EC agricultural policy hit Dalgety, which produces animal feed and is considered to be vulnerable should there be less cattle. The shares slid 10 to 432p. Profit-taking hit Ranks Hovis McDougall which lost 8 to 224p. In food retailing, Argyll Group was also subject to the same treatment, the shares off 5 at 356p. Tesco again retreated, the shares losing 7 to 264p. Leading property stocks continued to benefit from the positive sentiment exuding from this week's Land Securities results. There has also been talk of an improving climate in the retail sectors in London and the provinces. However, the London office rental market remains dire. Land Securities added 2 to 450p and MEPC 4 to 355p. Mountleigh, which is being supported by its bankers and faces a potentially crunch day next week with foreign creditors, crumbled further, down  3/4 to 3p. Profit-taking in Yorkshire Chemicals saw it retreat 9 to 380p. A similar fate befell British Vita, off 5 at 279p. Positive annual meetings at both Laird Group and Weir Group boosted the shares. Laird moved 8 ahead to 343p, also helped by a clutch of broker's recommendations, while Weir gained 4 to 579p. Continued worries about the German government pulling out of the European Fighter Aircraft project weakened Rolls-Royce, making it the biggest percentage faller in the FT-SE as the shares shed 4 1/2 to 168p, and some 5.2m shares changed hands.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2) Advances of Federal funds shall be deposited and maintained in insured accounts whenever possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (j) Consistent with the national goal of expanding the opportunities for women-owned and minority-owned business enterprises, recipients shall be encouraged to use women-owned and minority-owned banks (a bank which is owned at least 50 percent by women or minority group members).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (k) Recipients shall maintain advances of Federal funds in interest bearing accounts, unless paragraph (k)(1), (k)(2), or (k)(3) of this section apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The recipient receives less than $120,000 in Federal awards per year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The best reasonably available interest bearing account would not be expected to earn interest in excess of $250 per year on Federal cash balances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The depository would require an average or minimum balance so high that it would not be feasible within the expected Federal and non-Federal cash resources.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> In keeping with Electronic Funds Transfer rules, (31 CFR Part 206), interest should be remitted to the HHS Payment Management System through an electronic medium such as the FEDWIRE Deposit system. Recipients who do not have this capability should use a check.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (l) For those entities where CMIA and its implementing regulations do not apply, interest earned on Federal advances deposited in interest bearing accounts shall be remitted annually to Department of Health and Human Services, Payment Management System, P.O. Box 6021, Rockville, MD 20852. Interest amounts up to $250 per year may be retained by the recipient for administrative expense. State universities and hospitals shall comply with CMIA, as it pertains to interest. If an entity subject to CMIA uses its own funds to pay pre-award costs for discretionary awards without prior written approval from DOL, it waives its right to recover the interest under CMIA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (m) Except as noted elsewhere in this part, only the following forms shall be authorized for the recipients in requesting advances and reimbursements. DOL shall not require more than an original and two copies of these forms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) SF&hyph;270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement. The SF&hyph;270 is the standard form for all nonconstruction programs when electronic funds transfer or predetermined advance methods are not used. DOL, however, has the option of using this form for construction programs in lieu of the SF&hyph;271, ``Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) SF&hyph;271, Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs. The SF&hyph;271 is the standard form to be used for requesting reimbursement for construction programs. However, DOL may  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> substitute <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the SF&hyph;270 when DOL determines that it provides adequate information to meet Federal needs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;95.23  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Cost sharing or matching.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) All contributions, including cash and third party in-kind, shall be accepted as part of the recipient's cost sharing or matching when such contributions meet all of the following criteria:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Are verifiable from the recipient's records.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

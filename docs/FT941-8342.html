			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Financial markets braced for further turbulence International financial markets look set for another bout of turbulence today after the sell-off that caused heavy falls in US and European bond and equity markets late last Friday. One senior marketmaker in UK equities said yesterday that the FT-SE 100, the London market's leading stocks, could probably be marked down by as much as 60 points at the opening to try to head off any attempted selling by the big institutions. He said that 3,355 on the FT-SE 100 would be a benchmark for market sentiment: 'If it closes above 3,355 we should stabilise.' The FT-SE 100 closed at 3,382.6 last Friday. Wall Street is closed today - Presidents' Day. Last week's sell-off came as bond dealers took fright at talk of exceptionally heavy selling of international bonds by some big US hedge funds, which are involved in aggressive short-term trading but seek to offset exposure to changes in market rates. This was compounded by worries about what Mr Alan Greenspan, US Federal Reserve chairman, will say to Congress tomorrow in a review of monetary policy. Asian centres will provide the first pointers to international market performance today. In Tokyo, shares edged lower in thin morning trading, with the Nikkei average down 18 at midday. Hong Kong stocks were sharply down in early trade. Mr Nick Knight, analyst at Nomura, the stockbroker, said: 'The Hong Kong market is a critical and sensitive indicator of US money flows. If Hong Kong is down 200 points we'll have a manageable fall in London but if it is significantly larger than that, then it could be serious.'

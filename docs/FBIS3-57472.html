			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Nadein: "When the Economy Is </F> Flourishing, Congress Gives a Standing Ovation"]    [Text] Washington -- Bill Clinton arrived at the podium in  the House of Representatives to deliver his first State of the  Union message at the height of his popularity, like an  experienced sportsman who, while making minor slipups on the  way, skillfully peaks in time for the crucial competition.    Figures that have just been published show that at the end  of  his first year Clinton has outstripped even such a revered  President as Ronald Reagan.    There is no doubt that the number of those who approve of  Clinton's activities in the White House will increase following  his well-judged and passionate speech which met with applause,  ovations, or whistles of approval on at least 63 occasions.  Clinton thanked Congress for all the achievements of the first  year of his presidency, which make a rather impressive picture.  It was on the legislators -- the people who who almost wrecked  his budget (it was passed by one vote), all but consigned to  oblivion the program to change the tax system and reduce the  state debt, and furiously resisted restrictions on the use of  weapons (the Brady law) -- that the President bestowed his  special thanks, his final sentence sounding amazingly  convincing: "Not once did I use my presidential veto," Clinton  said, meaning that the combination of firmness and compromises  that characterizes the administration made extreme measures  unnecessary.    Economic growth, which some perspicacious experts predicted  back in the final months of Bush's presidency, is now a  statistical fact. Clinton pointed to production growth, the  increasing number of jobs, the low interest rate, and increased  consumer confidence. "For the first time since Harry Truman we  will have had three consecutive deficit-free years and the  dollar will have stayed where it is," the President said,  prompting the one of the longest ovations.    Clinton stressed that all this was achieved without raising  taxes for the vast majority of the population, and, above all,  without placing an extra burden on the backbone of society --  the middle class. "Only the very rich, only 1.2 percent of the  population, will pay higher taxes; no one else, and that is a  fact," the President said.    Noting that many politicians in Washington had recommended  him to continue the policy of cutting defense expenditure this  year, Clinton said that he had rejected that approach: In the  new budget for fiscal 1994-1995 the U.S. armed forces will not  receive any less money than in the previous year.    Addressing not so much the legislators as the ordinary  people  who put him in the White House, Clinton mapped out a tough  schedule for the next campaign, on which he is certainly pinning  the future of his presidency -- a statewide health program.</p>

			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / UK Company News: IVS sells Sheffield Cable for Pounds 1.9m General Cable, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Compagnie Generale des Eaux, has bought IVS Cable Holdings' 87.5 per cent stake in Sheffield Cable Media for Pounds 1.9m cash. IVS is 49.5 per cent owned by Flextech, the USM-quoted company which sold its original oil services business in May to develop its satellite and cable television interests which are largely controlled by IVS. Sheffield Cable was awarded the 210,000 home cable franchise for the city in 1990. IVS became its majority shareholder in 1991 following the merger of Flextech's cable interests with those of IVS. Following the disposal of Sheffield Cable, IVS retains several smaller cable franchise interests  - including Andover, Salisbury and Jersey  - totalling 216,000 homes.</p>

			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / International Company News: Record sales at largest US tool manufacturer GIDDINGS &amp; LEWIS, the largest US machine tool maker, yesterday reported its highest sales and earnings since it went public in 1989, due to continued strong demand for its industrial automation systems. G &amp; L, which took over its struggling rival Cross &amp; Trecker late last year, raised operating net earnings from Dollars 18.4m, or Dollars 1.73 a share, in 1990 to Dollars 21.3m, or Dollars 1.84, last year. The figures include Cross &amp; Trecker from October 31, but exclude tax credits of 6 cents and 12 cents a share in 1991 and 1990 respectively. Fourth-quarter operating net earnings rose from Dollars 4.75m to Dollars 6.3m, but earnings per share fell from 45 to 43 cents on increased shares outstanding. Revenues jumped from Dollars 66m to Dollars 131.1m for the quarter, and from Dollars 243m to Dollars 326.6m for the year. The company reported record bookings of Dollars 203.7m in the fourth quarter, up from Dollars 70.9m a year earlier. Mr William Fife, chairman and chief executive, said quotations for new equipment had picked up well since the acquisition. The deal turned Giddings &amp; Lewis into the world's fourth biggest machine tool producer, and was aimed partly at expanding the company's presence in continental Europe, where C &amp; T was stronger.</p>

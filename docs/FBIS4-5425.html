			<p>BFN     [Text] Lieutenant General Anuson Kritsanaserani, director  of the Supreme Command Information Office, disclosed that  Supreme Commander Air Chief Marshal Woranat Aphichari will visit  Cambodia this month to discuss with Cambodian military leaders  problems that exist between the two countries. He said efforts  had been made to arrange for a visit which, he believed, would  enable the two parties to thrash out misunderstandings.    Commenting on a report that the Cambodian Government was  planning to lodge a protest with the UN Security Council about  Thailand's support for the Khmer Rouge, Lieutenant General  Anuson said it is entitled to do so. The Thai military has no  worries because it has facts to explain, but it prefers to leave  the matter to the Foreign Ministry to handle.</p>

The so-called "secret constitutional amendment" was  disclosed  a few days ago by a Hong Kong newspaper. "Guided" by the  British Hong Kong Government last July, the paper disclosed, the  British Privy Council amended the "Letters Patent," the  constitutional law of Hong Kong, without informing the members  of Hong Kong's Legco. The original provision on the formation  of Legco, that is, 3 ex-officio seats, 8 appointed seats, and 39  seats returned by elections was amended to 20 seats returned by  direct elections, 30 returned by functional constituencies, and  10 returned by the election committee. This attempt by the  British Hong Kong Government in the "constitutional amendment"  is quite obvious, that is, offer constitutional grounds to Legco  to adopt Patten's "constitutional reform" for the Legco  elections in 1995. Otherwise, the legislation on  "constitutional reform" adopted by Legco without relevent  amendments made to the "Letters Patent" could be regarded as a  "violation of the constitution." Fully confident that his  "constitutional reform" will be adopted "intact," Mr. Patten  made preparations in advance in the first half of last year and  completed the "constitutional amendment" process in a bid to  implement his package after its adoption by Legco.    However, Patten neglected two points: First, he has said  volubly that the 1994/1995 elections should be "fair and open"  and that "everything will be ultimately determined by Legco."  When China and Britain started negotiations on the 1994/1995  elections, he also threatened that even an agreement between the  two sides must eventually be determined by Legco. How could the  formation of Legco in 1995 be determined by an amendment to the  "Letters Patent" before Legco has made a decision on the 1995  electoral package and before Legco has debated the said package?  Legco's deliberations on the 1995 elections would then be  meaningless. Patten knows quite well that the "Letters Patent"  is not an ordinary document which can be willfully amended.  Moreover, the above amendment has been adopted by the Privy  Council and signed by the British Queen. This "constitutional  amendment" move by the British Hong Kong Government is indeed  mysterious. Why did they do it so stealthily and in secret?  This is diametrically opposed to Mr Patten's "open" motto! No  wonder Legco members feel they are being cheated. We can see  more clearly that the governor's "democracy" is but a soap  bubble which can be easily pricked.    Second, Patten has all along refused to admit that the  foreign ministers of the two countries had reached agreements  and understanding on the number of directly elected seats for  the 1995 elections in letters exchanged in early 1990. Later,  although the British side reluctantly agreed to take the Joint  Declaration, the Basic Law, and the relevant agreements and  understanding reached between the two countries as the basis of  the talks between the two sides, the British side never  abandoned its "three violations" stance, which included its  refusal to abide by the agreements and understandings reached  between the two governments. This was precisely the reason  which led to the termination of the talks. Nevertheless, 20  seats returned by direct elections, 30 returned by functional  constituencies, and 10 returned by the election committee set  out in the constitutional amendment to the "Letters Patent" and  adopted by the British Privy Council are identical with those  set out in the agreements and understandings reached between the  Chinese and British foreign ministers in their letters exchanged  in early 1990. We would like to ask: Since the British side  does not admit that the two countries had reached agreements and  understanding on the number of directly elected Legco seats in  1995, why has it amended the "Letters Patent" in this way?  Thus, it is clearly obvious that the British side knew well  whether or not the two governments had reached agreements and  understanding on the 1995 elections and the question of  convergence with the Basic Law.    Mr. Patten's negligence of these two points has thrown him  into a predicament. In the face of discontent and condemnation  from within and outside Legco, he put on a show, saying that it  was but "a storm in a teaspoon" in an attempt to turn a big  problem into a small one and a small one to nothing. However,  no matter how experienced Mr. Patten is in playing the tricks of  a politician, his high-sounding words of "openness and fairness"  and striving for "democracy" for Hong Kong people collapse by  themselves. Moreover, his perfidy and violation of the  agreements and understandings reached between the two  governments will be exposed to the public.    "Lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet." This is  a misfortune which no politician who think himself clever can  evade.</p>

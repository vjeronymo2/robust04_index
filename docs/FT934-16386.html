			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Region climbs as Nikkei vacillates Bleak corporate news discouraged investors and margin-linked selling in the afternoon eroded earlier gains, but share prices finally closed marginally higher on investment trust buying at the session's close, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average closed up 57.50 at 20,321.93. Relief over the ending of the turmoil in Russia and an overnight rise in the Chicago futures market prompted arbitrage linked buying. The index rose to a high of 20,410.04, but later fell to the day's low of 20,237.82 as margin traders facing settlements liquidated positions in small lots. Volume remained thin at 230m shares against 183m. An unexpected downward earnings revision by Nintendo, the video game maker, added to the uncertainty over share prices, and many investors remained on the sidelines. Advances led declines by 550 to 440, with 192 issues remaining unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 0.90 to 1,634.93, while in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.08 to 1,269.20. Some traders remain hopeful that the Nikkei will remain above the 20,300 75-day moving average, but most investors chose to focus on gloomy corporate news yesterday. Video game makers and other amusement stocks were slack due to the Nintendo forecast of a 21 per cent fall in pre-tax profits, to Y121bn, for the current year to next March. Discount menswear retailers continued to weaken on the Fair Trade Commission's investigations into allegedly misleading advertisements, and construction companies were lower on the spate of bribery allegations and the arrest of an executive at Taisei, a leading construction company. Nintendo fell Y510 to Y8,790, Sega Enterprises lost Y400 to Y10,700 and Konami Y120 to Y4,930. Among menswear discounters, Aoki International fell Y80 to Y5,420. Taisei lost Y26 to Y613, while Shimizu declined Y14 to Y816 and Obayashi fell Y21 to Y624. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the bellwether stock of the Tokyo stock market, lost Y8,000 to Y868,000. Foreigners supported high-technology issues. Sony rose Y40 to Y4,650 and Sharp rose Y10 to Y1,560. Toyota Motor gained Y40 to Y1,750 and Honda Motor rose Y30 to Y1,570 on buying by overseas investors. Semiconductor related issues were stronger, with Nikon up Y32 to Y947 and Tokyo Electron advancing Y70 to Y3,100. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 22.69 to 22,274.63 in volume of 19.7m shares. Roundup Pacific Rim markets took their cue to move ahead from the easing of Russian tensions, as well as diverse local factors. HONG KONG continued to benefit from strong US institutional demand and the Hang Seng index finished at its third consecutive record high, up 125.16 at 7,869.48 and close to the intraday high of 7,878.35. Several leading US houses have increased their weighting for Hong Kong in recent days, triggering heavy demand for local stock, with immediate political developments taking a back seat in the current rally. Turnover improved to HKDollars 4.93bn from HKDollars 3.72bn on Monday, with turnover in index futures and options twice that of the share market. AUSTRALIA ended at a six-year high, boosted by a new allocation of funds at the start of the new quarter and strong performances by BHP and News Corp. The All Ordinaries index closed 21.5 ahead at the day's high of 1,998.5, with analysts commenting that only weakness in the gold sector preventing it from breaching the 2,000-level. BHP jumped 52 cents or 3.2 per cent to a record close of ADollars 16.94, after an intraday high of ADollars 16.96. News Corp also at a peak, touched ADollars 11.00 before easing back to end 14 cents stronger at ADollars 10.92. BANGKOK jumped 2.1 per cent with across-the-board rises in active trade and the SET index ended above 1,000 for the first time in three years. The index leaped 20.74to end at the day's high of 1,019.45 in heavy turnover of Bt8.39bn. SINGAPORE moved higher in record volume of 618m shares against a previous peak of 550.12m set on April 14. The Straits Times Industrial index rose 10.44 to 2,033.51. NEW ZEALAND moved higher, ahead of the government's pre-election fiscal update which came after the market closed, and the NZSE-40 capital index added 9.25 to 1,955.61 in turnover of NZDollars 38m. TAIWAN was unable to maintain its best levels with profit-taking leaving the weighted index to finish 5.02 higher at 3,813.26, after an intraday high of 3,832, in thin turnover of TDollars 10bn. MANILA rebounded strongly as the currency stabilised and the composite index rose 46.52 to 1,951.06 after Monday's 55-point plunge as volume swelled to 504m shares. SEOUL closed slightly higher in a day of improved trading volume in spite of rumours of a debt default by a leading business group. The composite stock index added 2.66 points to 717.71.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["a.z."-signed report: "Alarming Balance Sheet of </F> Drug-Related Deaths"]    [Text] Vienna -- The number of drug-related deaths in  Vienna rose by 10 percent from the previous year to 103 in 1993.  The 1992/93 drug report, presented on Friday [20 May], points  out that, above all, an increasing number of young people die  from overdoses of drugs. The youngest person to die from drugs  was 14. A total of 10 young people under age died of drug  consumption. At 37 deaths, the development is also alarming  among the 20- to 24-year-olds. A new "record" is expected for  this year because 57 drug-related deaths have been reported so  far.    "Drug-related deaths are no yardstick for a good or bad drug  policy," Sepp Rieder, the city councillor responsible for  health, stated, referring to the report. The opposition  criticized his lack of action and the absence of efficient  preventive measures.</p>

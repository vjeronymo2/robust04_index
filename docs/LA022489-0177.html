			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> 'WILL FIND WAY' FOR CUTS -- YEUTTER  </P> <P> Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter said today "we'll find a way" to meet  President Bush's demands to cut $2 billion from farm subsidy spending while  preserving leverage for world trade reform.  </P> <P> Yeutter, in office since Feb. 8, said he hopes to announce his first major  appointments of top positions at the department next week. "We'll find a way to  do so because that's a requirement of the process," Yeutter said when asked if  $2 billion could be removed from subsidy spending. "The deficit must be cut. .  . . Agriculture will have to play its part, its proper role in that process.  We'll find a way to do so."  </P></p>

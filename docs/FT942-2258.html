			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Survey of Spain - Banking, Finance and Investment (6): Foreign funds flow in / Takeovers are changing direction Two disposals in the past year - the sale of a 15 per cent stake held by the March family in the construction and chemical company Uralita and the sale by Banesto of its 34 per cent stake in the Acerinox steel producer - suggest a new trend in inward investment. In the past a Spanish company was simply the object of an outright foreign takeover. In 1991, for example, Petromed, a Banesto-controlled oil company, was sold to British Petroleum, and in 1992 J Bibby &amp; Sons, the UK subsidiary of South Africa's Barlow Rand, bought Finanzauto, a construction services group in which the March family had formerly been a major equity holder. Large takeovers are far from over. This April, following the lead of Guinness' 1990 takeover of Cruzcampo, Spain's leading brewery, Allied Lyons acquired the Pedro Domecq wine firm, the last big domestically-owned sherry producer. But the Uralita and Acerinox disposals represented a new development. In both cases fresh capital flowed into the Spanish companies in the shape of foreign institutions. Mostly UK-based institutions replaced the March family's holding - Corporacion Financiera Alba - in Uralita and mostly largely US institutions bought the Banesto equity in Acerinox. The existing management remained in place at Uralita and at Acerinox. During recessionary cycles, this type of inward investment is common in markets that have achieved a high level of maturity. As rates come down and the markets become bullish, institutional investors are willing to pay a market-driven value for equity that is above the conventional acquisition price in an industrial takeover. In Spain this is new because it was only at the end of the 1980s that the Madrid market began to take on the sort of strength and liquidity that attracts long-term investment from foreign institutions. In the early 1980s, when the economy also dipped into recession, the foreign funds option was precluded by the narrowness of the domestic stock exchange. 'For the first time we were able to employ Anglo-Saxon practices and seek out institutions,' says Mr Santiago Eguidazu, head of corporate finance at AB Asesores, the Madrid firm which advised and lead managed the Uralita transaction. Cyclically-exposed Spanish companies in need of fresh capital, such as Uralita and Acerinox, are for the first time able to tap foreign institutions that can be counted upon to anticipate the end of a recessionary cycle. Uralita, with its odd mix of construction and PVC-weighted chemicals, is in addition a difficult takeover target. It would have to be broken up in order to attract separate industrial buyers and even then it would have to await a sustained economic upturn that would permit the appearance of potential cash-flow rich acquirers. Phillips &amp; Drew Fund Management owns 10 per cent of Uralita's equity, having recently increased its position in the company, and the Royal Bank of Scotland controls almost 9 per cent of the stock including a 5 per cent stake owned by Scottish Widows. Foreign funds now control the 34 per cent of Acerinox equity formerly owned by Banesto. The US investment bank JP Morgan, advised Banesto bank on the sale of a 25 per cent of its equity, placing it in the US and AB Asesores subsequently placed a further 9 per cent. The Uralita investment is instructive because the company smoothed the path towards the final deal and, by doing so, pointed the way for companies seeking similar relationships with foreign institutions. What Phillips &amp; Drew and Scottish Widows wanted and obtained from Uralita was the right to name independent directors with a brief to exercise a broad supervision of the company's management as well as a close control over certain areas, such as the controversial issue of the board's remuneration. These directors - there are three, all senior officers of big Spain-based firms - maintain a fluid relationship between the Uralita's executive management and the shareholder institutions that they represent. Such a role is new to Spain. 'The funds can have a shot at influencing management decisions,' said a banker close to the company. 'They can make telephone calls that carry clout and they almost certainly won't have to make angry scenes at the AGM.' In fact the institutions should have little cause for worry about their investments in Uralita and in Acerinox. Both are on course to become the sort of turnaround stories that gladden a fund manager's heart. At Uralita, the effect of an intensive restructuring programme which was started in 1991 is begining to be felt. Sales volumes in the group's main division, refurbishing and housing, are up and PVC prices, the mainstay of its chemical unit, are recovering strongly. The group could break even this year - following losses of Pta7.5bn (Dollars 55m) in 1993 - pay a dividend next year and post profits of some Pta9bn in 1996. Acerinox reports similar progress for its stainless steel business. The company's net profits of Pta7.5bn last year are estimated to rise to Pta10.7bn this year and are forecast to climb to Pta16.2bn in 1996. Acerinox's board has approved a Pta6bn investment to raise its production capacity and earnings per share are forecast to stand at Pta1,676 in 1996 against last year's Pta785.</p>

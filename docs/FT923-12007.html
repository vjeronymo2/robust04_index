			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / French try to put the fizz back into champagne sales THE troubled champagne industry is trying to beat the recession in a way which seems guaranteed to please its Bacchanalian customers - by improving the quality of its product. Champagne sales rose rapidly in the self-indulgent climate of the 1980s, but the industry has since suffered severely from the impact of the recession on important export markets, notably the US and the UK. The industry is now taking action by tightening the specifications for champagne production. The quantity of grapes required to produce champagne is being increased from 150 kg a hectolitre to 160 kg. At the same time the amount of grapes harvested is being reduced to a maximum of 10,400 kg a hectare from up to 12,000 kg in the previous year. These new restrictions will, or so the champagne producers hope, address the demand problem by limiting production. They also ought to improve the quality of champagne going on to the market. The hitch appears to be price. The industry hopes to be able to charge more when its new improved product goes on sale in 1994. It will then face the challenge of convincing its customers to pay more for their champagne in a weak marketplace. In the first quarter of this year, the volume of champagne exports fell by 22 per cent against the first three months of 1991, when the market was destabilised by the Gulf War, from 12.2m bottles to 9.516m bottles. The UK market performed particularly poorly with sales of 1.8m bottles in the first quarter, compared with 4.5m in the same period three years ago. Even the French market is weak, with sales down 3 per cent in the first quarter of 1992.</p>

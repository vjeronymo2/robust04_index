			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Carlos Anel Cordero] </F>   [Text] President Guillermo Endara could withdraw from the  Legislative Assembly the draft bill on constitutional reforms,  in which the abolition of the Panamanian Army is proposed as  well as financial and administrative autonomy for the Electoral  Tribunal.    Endara has acknowledged opposition had "emerged" ever since  these constitutional reforms were presented. Various sectors of  the community have expressed their rejection to these reforms,  and this is why he is assessing their possible withdrawal from  the assembly.    Nevertheless, Endara has said he personally agrees with the  text of these reforms, which offer greater freedom of action and  financial independence to the Electoral Tribunal.    In the name of the executive branch, Government and Justice  Minister Jacobo Salas presented to the Legislative Assembly at  the end of May a "package of reforms" to the Constitution that  should be approved during the current assembly session and  ratified by the next.    Up until now, the Legislative Assembly has not initiated the  debate on this "package of reforms" to the Constitution, but  political, professional, and even internal sectors of the  assembly, have rejected it.    Endara has said that as of yet he has not decided if he will  call special assembly sessions to discuss these reforms;  nevertheless, he has said this is a possibility he is also  contemplating.    The National Front for a Constituent Assembly (FRENO) last  week reiterated its rejections of these reforms, affirming an  overall revision must be made to the Constitution instead of  "adding more bits and pieces."    FRENO has insisted on the need to call a constituent  assembly  to take charge of the drafting of a new constitutional text the  nation requires in light of the changes that have occurred in  the past years.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Eduard Shevardnadze, chairman of the Georgian  Parliament and head of state, has met a delegation from the  European Bank for Reconstruction and Development [EBRD]. The  delegation was introduced to Eduard Shevardnadze by Tengiz  Geleishvili, who has been involved for the past five months in  developing a program suggested by the EBRD. The visitors  expressed surprise that the Georgian Parliament did not confirm  Tengiz Geleishvili's nomination to the post of chairman of the  Committee of Foreign Economic Relations.    Part of the 2 billion ECU [European Currency Unit] allotted  by the EBRD to the republics of the former Soviet Union will be  used in Georgia to develop private business, revive the economy  and industry, improve international telecommunications and reach  financial stabilization.    Work on a large project is approaching its end. Taking into  consideration the current critical situation in Georgia, a team  working on this project has made a decision to start work on the  Enguri hydropower station, the Rioni hydropower station, and  other substations. Some $40 million have been allotted for this  purpose.    Apart from such priorities, the program stipulates  restoration and reconstruction of Georgian sea ports, financial  stabilization of Georgian banks, creation of an infrastructure  required for starting the republic's industry, and improvement  of the network of international telecommunications. This will  encourage business and financing of small- and medium-sized  enterprises.    At the end of the meeting, Eduard Shevardnadze said: We  believe that our relations are quite serious and large-scale. I  have to admit that we are in a great hurry and therefore, I  think we have to work out a joint program, which will determine  the exact time and work details. The program will reflect  present and future work and if events develop as we hope, normal  working conditions will be established very soon, I am sure.</p>

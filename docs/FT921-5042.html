			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Argentina wins praise from Gatt ARGENTINA'S rapid and far-reaching economic reform programme won praise yesterday from trading partners and from Gatt, reports Frances Williams from Geneva. A report by Gatt economists on Argentina's trade policies says the reforms have transformed the country in a few years 'from one of the most cosseted economies in the world to one of the more open', with gratifying results in low inflation, economic growth, return of flight capital and rising exports. At yesterday's debate on the report by Gatt's governing council, Argentina was described as 'a model' for rich and poor countries alike. The Gatt report, says Argentina has virtually eliminated quantitative import restrictions, which in 1986 covered half domestic production. Average tariffs have dropped from 40 per cent to 12 per cent over the same period, export taxes have fallen substantially and the government's policies of deregulation and privatisation have increased competition and opened up major opportunities for foreign direct investment. High protection in the car and electronics sectors remains a concern but car import restraints are due to begin being phased out in 1994.</p>

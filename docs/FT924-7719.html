			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / International Company News: Pernod Ricard to miss forecast PERNOD Ricard, the French drinks group, yesterday warned that it would miss its earlier indications of a 6 per cent increase in 1992 net profits, so triggering a run on its shares. The group, producer of the aperitif which bears its name, plus a range of wines, spirits and soft drinks, published an underlying 5.9 per cent rise in turnover to FFr10.34bn (Dollars 1.91bn) for the first three quarters of the year. Excluding adjustments for disposals, sales fell by 6.7 per cent, within which turnover in the third quarter was down by 12 per cent to FFr3.46bn. Either way, the result was below market expectations, and a reflection of weaker than expected consumer demand. The shares fell by FFr 34.4 to FFr399.1 in Paris yesterday. Pernod Ricard managed a 7.3 per cent rise in net profits last year, to FFr956m excluding exceptional gains.</p>

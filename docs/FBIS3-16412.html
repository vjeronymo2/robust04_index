On the same day, Gromov put to sea on board anti-submarine  ship Admiral Kharlamov to test the crew's combat skills, a navy  spokesman told Interfax.    In the meantime, his deputy Admiral Igor Kasatonov in an  interview with Interfax described the fleet as being Russia's  most powerful naval group both operationally and strategically.  In his words, it is the Northern Fleet which has most of the  country's nuclear-powered submarines carrying nuclear missiles.  The admiral said the Fleet was securing Russia's strategic  interests in that direction.    On the might of the four Russian fleets, Kasatonov said that  by far the strongest of them all were the Northern and Pacific  Fleets, both of them ocean-going. By contrast, the Baltic and  Black Sea Fleets are responsible for carrying out regional  tasks, he said.</p>

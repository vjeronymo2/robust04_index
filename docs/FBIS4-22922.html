Medved, Kiev; UDC 614.717:628.16]-072.7]    [Abstract] The advantages and characteristic features of  the use of biotesting for assessing the water quality are  outlined, and the concept of hygienic significance which denotes  toxicity to humans is introduced. For illustration, the effect  of imported pesticides on Daphnia magna is  investigated using draft GOST guidelines. The GOST approach is  compared to the EPA and other procedures, and the acute toxic  effect of the Maveric pesticide on Daphnia magna is  summarized. The differences in the methods under study are  discussed. The comparative analysis makes it possible to  speculate that the methodological approaches to water quality  assessment with the help of biotesting need further improvement  but the findings are still insufficient for drawing definitive  conclusions about the role of biotesting within the system of  standard sanitary water quality control.

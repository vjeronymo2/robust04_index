			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / CBI survey affirms steady economic recovery The UK economy is improving steadily with few signs of an upsurge in inflation, according to yesterday's Confederation of British Industry's quarterly industrial trends survey. The survey endorses recent official data showing a pick-up in output and contradicts more gloomy reports, notably last week's survey by the British Chambers of Commerce. Positive trends found by the CBI include improved business confidence, an increase in manufacturing orders and output, and the first sign of an increase in investment in plant and machinery since July 1989. There appears to be continued downward pressure on costs, with more manufacturers expecting to cut costs than at any time since the first survey in 1958. However, the CBI said it had two main areas of concern about the UK's economic prospects in 1994. The first was the tax increases and government expenditure cuts which 'will remove a significant proportion of purchasing power from the economy'. The second was the recent appreciation of the pound 'which may well hold back export growth'. Sir David Lees, chairman of the CBI's economic affairs committee, said 'the survey alone would not indicate a need to relax monetary policy further'. But in view of 'the shadow of those tax increases', he thought it would be 'necessary and desirable to reduce interest rates'. Business confidence increased for the fifth quarter in succession, according to the survey. The number of firms which were more optimistic about business in general exceeded those which were less optimistic by 27 per cent. This balance, which indicates the trend, compares with plus 1 per cent in October. Optimism has been fuelled by an increase in output and orders. The balance of companies reporting an increase in manufacturing output was the highest quarterly figure since July 1989. Details, Page 11 Survivor's guide, Page 16 Lex, Page 22</p>

			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: Hungary to build share portfolio to back bonds HUNGARY plans to build a share portfolio to back a planned issue of convertible bonds, a privatisation official said yesterday. As a first step the State Property Agency (SPA), the privatisation authority, has put aside a 10 per cent state stake in a blue chip company to inaugurate the fund, according to Mr Peter Rajcsanyi, a director. Buyers of Hungarian convertible bonds could exercise them into shares from this fund. After approval of the draft scheme, expected within a month, state stakes in about 24 partially-privatised companies would be added to the portfolio, Mr Rajcsanyi said. Half of these companies would come from Hungary's First Privatisation Programme, a project begun last September to put 20 of the country's best companies into private ownership. Once the Hungarian National Bank had decided on the timing, a single investment bank would be chosen to manage the convertible bond issue, he said. Mr Rajcsanyi's remarks follow a statement by Mr Lajos Bokros, president of the Budapest Stock Exchange, that Hungary planned to issue Dollars 150m-Dollars 200m worth of convertible bonds on the back of at least Dollars 250m worth of shares. Convertible bonds are an imaginative way of linking Hungary's ambitious privatisation programme with paying the country's Dollars 21bn foreign debt, the highest per capita in eastern Europe. 'This is a novelty and we expect a relatively high interest in capital markets,' Mr Rajcsanyi said yesterday. 'If we come up with new ideas and new opportunities, then interest and eagerness can be maintained', he said. Hungarian officials think that the new type of bonds would contain national borrowing costs. Making Hungarian bonds convertible would give a foundation to them that went beyond the usual guarantee of the national central bank, Mr Rajcsanyi said.</p>

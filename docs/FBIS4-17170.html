			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Konstantin Maksimov, Kalmykia parliament </F> speaker, by Boir Borboyev, in the "Kalmykia" column: "`The  Problems of the People's Rehabilitation Will Be Resolved Before  the End of This Year.' Parliament Chairman Konstantin Maksimov  Hopes for Assistance from Moscow" -- place, date not given]    [Text] [Borboyev] Konstantin Nikolayevich, at what stage  of resolution is the problem of rehabilitation of the Kalmyk  people?    [Maksimov] I would like to single out three points in  President Yeltsin's edict on rehabilitation of the Kalmyk people  and on state support for its revival and development, signed at  the end of last year. Kalmykia officials are working closely  with the federal authorities in addressing these problems.  Approximately 40 billion rubles from the Russian budget is  needed to pay material compensation to those who suffered from  repression, as well as members of their families. We find  understanding in Moscow, and I think that before the end of the  year the problem will be fully resolved.    [Borboyev] Does the republic itself envision any measures to  compensate for the people's physical and moral losses?    [Maksimov] Yes, certainly. Our republic's president deems  it essential to reduce the pensionable age for approximately  30,000 persons who were formerly repressed. Our proposal on  making additions to the Russian Law On State Pensions in the  Russian Federation is currently being studied by federal bodies.  The first volume of the Book of Memory (overall there will be  two) has come out, which includes the names of all  representatives of the Kalmyk people who died during the years  of deportation. The republic's authorities are grateful to  workers of the archives and libraries in Stavropol and  Krasnoyarsk Krays, Astrakhan, Rostov, Volgograd, and a number of  other oblasts who have shown understanding and preserved  elements of spiritual, cultural, and religious values. This  year the property of the Kalmyk people outside the republic will  be returned.    [Borboyev] Will these benefits be extended to Kalmyks living  outside the republic?    [Maksimov] Yes, this is envisioned by our legislative  enactments because approximately 30,000 representatives of the  Kalmyk people live in krays and oblasts of the Russian  Federation, in particular in Siberia where they were deported  illegally but by the will of fortune have stayed there up till  now.    [Borboyev] How topical at present are Kalmykia's territorial  claims, in particular on the neighboring Astrakhan Oblast?    [Maksimov] Our authorities have always -- before as well as  after perestroyka -- been raising the question about the  territories of Limannskiy and Dolbanskiy Rayons of Kalmykia  which were illegally transferred to our neighbors. These are  good pasture lands which could benefit the republic greatly.  The problem remains, but at the present period we are for a  moratorium on revising territorial borders. At the same time  approximately 400,000 hectares of so- called "black" soil is  leased from the republic by Dagestan and Astrakhan Oblast. And  whereas a leasing agreement was reached with Dagestan last year,  none has been made with Astrakhan Oblast so far. I consider it  necessary to monitor the condition of our lands at the state  level.</p>

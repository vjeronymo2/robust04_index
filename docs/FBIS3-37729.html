In an interview to the leading  German newspaper FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE ZEITUNG, Anatoliy Zlenko  said: We did not make a mistake when we thought that the  Yugoslav crisis should be settled by political means. A  bombardment can only escalate the conflict. The Ukrainian  foreign minister emphasized that the search is under way right  now for political resolution of the Balkan problem, which is  evidenced by the Russian proposal. Asked about Ukraine's  participation in the UN-sponsored peace keeping mission in  Yugoslavia, Anatoliy Zlenko said that the Ukrainian contingent  of the blue helmets will increase by an additional 800 people.</p>

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Taiwanese shares dip 6.1% after defaults TAIWAN'S stock market plunged 6.1 per cent after leading investors defaulted on TDollars 1.7bn (Pounds 35.6m) of payments to local brokerages for share purchases, Reuter reports from Taipei. The defaults, disclosed by the stock exchange late on Wednesday, appeared to be linked to the arrest of Mr Oung Ta-ming, a textile tycoon, last week over a Dollars 22m stock scandal, Taiwan's biggest. Brokers said the market plunge could trigger a chain of larger defaults in coming days. 'There is a collapse of confidence because Oung is the most important player in the market. It's hard to predict how bad the situation will get,' said Mr Hong Chi-ming of Top Soon Portfolio Securities. The Securities and Exchange Commission said it would investigate the reason for the defaults. Stock exchange officials said as many as eight investors had failed to make payments totalling TDollars 1.7bn to six brokerages. But another leading player, Mr Lei Po-lung, who was not named among the eight, told newspapers he was responsible for the defaults. Big speculators often use other investors to trade stocks for them. The newspapers quoted Mr Lei as saying he bought stocks on behalf of the Hualon group, which Oung heads, and Hualon then declined to provide money for the purchases. The stock market's weighted index plummeted 222.83 points to a 20-month low of 3,441.69.</p>

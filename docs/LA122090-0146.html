			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> MCNIGHT STRUTS HER STUFF AT THE CINEGRILL  </P> <P> There's a little bit of Sophie Tucker in singer/comedienne Sharon McNight. And  maybe a trace or two of Bette Midler, Hermione Gingold and Bernadette Peters.  It's quite a combination.  </P> <P> But the most important element in her style, as McNight's opening set at the  Cinegrill on Tuesday made clear, is her own fanciful mixture of off-the-wall  humor, sensitive lyric interpretation and big-time belting.  </P> <P> McNight, who received a 1989 Tony nomination for her role in "Starmites," sang  a collection of tunes carefully programmed to keep her audience off balance. A  bold, brassy strut through "Broadway Baby" was followed by a more reserved "In  the Meantime." Then, what seemed at first to be a Midleresque reading of "You  Are the Wind Beneath My Wings" became a devastatingly sardonic variation called  "You Are Contempt Beneath My Feet."  </P> <P> McNight, who was superbly accompanied by pianist/vocalist James Followell,  shifted gears again with a coolly straightforward interpretation of "Say It  Isn't So" and a touching performance of a new song, "Picture in the Home."  </P> <P> Then it was off to the races, as she sang, acted, mugged and danced her way  through a uniquely personal rendition of the entire opening Oz section from the  "Wizard of Oz." Switching voices wildly from Judy Garland to Billie Burke, from  Margaret Hamilton to a whole array of Munchkins, McNight was non-stop motion, a  one-woman show that managed to have fun and add a satiric touch or two without  diminishing or belittling a classic piece of film music.  </P> <P> McNight wrapped up the program with a continuously fascinating mixed bag of  material -- from the Doors to Gershwin. Never at a loss for a quip, a fast line  or a comeback, her first-rate vocal skills ready to handle the most  far-reaching demands, she was the complete cabaret artist -- and one who  deserves to be heard.  </P> <P> Sharon McNight: The Cinegrill at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, 7000 Hollywood  Blvd., Hollywood. Today through Saturday and Dec. 26-29. (213) 466-7000 or  Ticketmaster. DON HECKMAN  </P></p>

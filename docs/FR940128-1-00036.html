			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There is a strong view in the HACCP literature (see e.g.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ref. 51), which is reflected in one of NACMCF's seven principles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> listed above, that processors should actually have a plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> describing how they will handle deviations, and that this plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be part of the overall HACCP plan. FDA believes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there is merit in this view and encourages processors and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> importers to think through how they will handle deviations that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may occur. The agency has tentatively concluded, however, that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed requirements in &sect;123.7 represent the minimum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements necessary to ensure that processors and importers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respond effectively to deviations that could affect safety, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that given these provisions, it is not necessary to require that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a specific plan be formulated and adopted. FDA requests comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on this tentative conclusion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Records  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed above, maintenance of appropriate records is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fundamental to the success of an HACCP system (see section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> IV.A.6. of this document). In recognition of this fact, FDA is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposing to require in &sect;123.8 that HACCP records contain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain necessary information; that processors review records of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring and related activities before distributing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products to which the records pertain; that processors and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> importers retain records for specific periods of time; and that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA investigators be given access to HACCP records.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA is proposing in &sect;123.8(a) that records involving  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> observations or measurements during processing, corrective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actions, and related activities, contain the identity of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product, product code, and date that the record was made. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purpose of this provision is to ensure that both the processor or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> importer and the regulator can readily link a record to a product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and to the timeframe in which the product was manufactured. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> linkage of the record to product is especially important when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there has been a deviation at a critical control point. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency has tentatively concluded that including the identity of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the product, product code, and date of the activity that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> record reflects provide the minimum necessary information to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enable the processor or the importer and, ultimately, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulator to determine what product may have been affected and to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> take appropriate action, such as withholding the product from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distribution or recalling it from distribution. Dates also help  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discern trends over time. Even when no deviation has occurred,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the information will enable both the processor and the regulator  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to identify factors that may help prevent problems in the future.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;123.8(a), FDA is also proposing to require that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information be recorded at the time that it is observed, and that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each record be signed by the operator or observer. It is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> important that information relating to observations be recorded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immediately to ensure accuracy. The record should be signed by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the individual who made the observation to ensure responsibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and accountability. Also, if there is a question about the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> record, a signature ensures that the source of the record will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> known.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA is proposing to require in &sect;123.8(b) that records  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receive a second review by an individual trained in accordance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with &sect;123.9, for verification purposes, before the product is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distributed into commerce. The purpose of this review is to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure that the processor or importer verifies that employees are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recording data in HACCP records, and that deviations from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> critical limits are being caught before products that may have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been affected can enter commerce. The agency is proposing to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require that this records verification be performed by a trained  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual to ensure that the records are reviewed by a person  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> who understands the HACCP system, understands the significance of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a processing deviation, and knows how to respond if a deviation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occurs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA is proposing in &sect;123.8(c) to require that HACCP records  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be retained for at least 1 year after they are prepared for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refrigerated products and for at least 2 years after they are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prepared for frozen or preserved (i.e., shelf-stable) products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These timeframes are based on the length of time that these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products can be expected to be in commercial distribution (Ref.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 52; Ref. 53, pp. 72&hyph;73) plus a reasonable time thereafter to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure that the records are there when the FDA inspector performs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the next inspection. They are the same timeframes as now  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided for in the Manual of Operations of the NSSP for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retention of records for raw molluscan shellfish. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

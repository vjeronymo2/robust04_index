			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In a statement dated 24 February, Senator  Jean-Jacques Clark Parent has written: Since 30 September 1991,  an abnormal situation has been developing in the country.  Jean-Bertrand Aristide, head of state legally elected during the  16 December 1990 elections, is not in Haiti. He is in  Washington, the capital of another sovereign country. Yet, until  now, he is acknowledged as president of the Republic of Haiti by  all national and international authorities including the  parliament, the Haitian Army, the churches, the private sector,  the United Nations, the OAS, and so forth, says Sen. Parent.    The question he has put to the Haitian Army, the parliament,  the United Nations, the OAS, and the powers called Friends of  Haiti is: Why is Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the president of the  Republic, not in Haiti today? Is he imprisoned in Washington as  Toussaint Louverture was in Fort Joux [located in the Jura  Mountains in France where Haitian General Toussaint Louverture  died on 7 April 1803 after he had attempted to free Haiti from  the French]? Only the United States can answer this question  through the words of its President, Bill Clinton. At any rate,  so far, the president of the Republic, Jean-Bertrand Aristide,  is not at the National Palace of Port-au-Prince, he adds.    As for me, I say no, because this is an affront to all  Haitians no matter whether they are rich or poor, black or  mulatto, military or civilian. Is that what the so-called  civilized people call the new world order? If so, is logic no  longer the universal way to reason soundly, because I have a  contrary opinion. Sen. Jean-Jacques Clark Parent further says: I  therefore urge General Cedras to resign, as agreed in the  Governors Island agreement; and I suggest that the Haitian Army,  the institution intended to guarantee the safety of lives and  property in the country, form within the next 72 hours a  high-ranking civilian-military delegation charged with going to  Washington in order to look for the president of the Republic,  Jean-Bertrand Aristide, and bring him [back] to the National  Palace of Port-au-Prince so he can carry out his duties as  president of the Republic under the security of the Haitian  Armed Forces until his mandate expires so as to put an end to  this unbearable situation gnawing at our country and it will be  justice, concludes the statement of Jean-Jacques Clark Parent,  senator of the Republic.    Parent has sent this statement to Jean-Bertrand Aristide,  Bill Clinton, the OAS, the United Nations, the governments of  Haiti's four friendly countries, the U.S. Congress, the  parliamentarians of the 45th legislature, the Army, all  ambassadors accredited to Haiti, Pope John Paul II, the Haitian  Episcopal Conference, the Association of Haitian Protestants,  the members of the Haitian Chamber of Commerce and Industries,  the members of the judiciary, and the press.</p>

			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Letter: Lloyd's costs and assets base seen as root of problems Sir, As an external Lloyd's Name I have so far gone along with David Coleridge's comment that Names 'freely signed pieces of paper authorising membership of each Syndicate', despite my misgivings as to the expertise of my agents and the losses my children and I have suffered of Pounds 100,000 for 1988 and Pounds 200,000 for 1989, with (I am told) further losses to come at least for 1990, and have not joined in litigation despite being urged to do so. However, at my rota interview I asked the same questions I had of my prospective agent: 'What will membership cost me in fees etc, and (as l was wary of joint and several liability) what if other names on a syndicate cannot pay their share of losses?' and received the same answers: to my second question, 'each Name writes for themselves, not one for another'. When my children joined subsequently the Outhwaite problems were receiving wide publicity and at their rota they asked, 'is there any way we could end up paying for these other people's losses?' and were told unequivocally there was not. The Council of Lloyd's has now decided that the market losses require that we should pay a levy, effectively retrospectively in that resignation now would not avoid it, which in real terms would cost us an additional Pounds 112,500 on top of our further losses to come. This makes 'not one for another' a travesty; I do not expect anyone else to pay our losses, but we did not join Lloyd's as captive providers of indefinite amounts of capital.

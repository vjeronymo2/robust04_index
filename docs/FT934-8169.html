			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Budget 1993: Food industry split on VAT lobbying aims - Guy de Jonquieres picks through a menu of nutritional anomalies THE UK subsidiary of Nestle, the world's biggest food manufacturer, made an embarrassing discovery this week. It found it was lobbying the Treasury to adopt two contradictory policies in the Budget. With one hand Nestle was supporting industry efforts to ward off any increase in value added tax on about 80 per cent of food products which are zero-rated. With the other it was backing a campaign - from which it has withdrawn - to abolish zero-rating on all but fresh food. Nestle is not alone in its confusion about Britain's complicated system of taxing food and drink, the complexities of which have split the industry - and many companies - down the middle. Most types of food are classified as necessities and carry a zero rate of VAT. All other food and drink products carry VAT at the standard 17.5 per cent rate. The categories are a relic of purchase tax, abolished in 1973, which discriminated against 'luxury' consumer products and services. Food manufacturers complain that two-tier VAT is riddled with anomalies. Gingerbread men dipped in chocolate carry VAT at 17.5 per cent, while gingerbread women dipped in caramel are zero-rated. Chocolate-coated biscuits and shelled nuts are taxed at the standard rate, but chocolate-filled biscuits and unshelled nuts go VAT-free. Rapid product innovation has aggravated the discrepancies. When the tax rules were first devised the only snacks were potato-based or produced by 'swelling' cereals. These still carry standard VAT. Newer products, however, such as tortilla chips which are not made from potato or swollen cereals, are zero-rated. Manufacturers say such inequities - exaggerated by the rise in the standard VAT rate from 8 per cent to 17.5 per cent in the past 20 years  - distort the market. Efforts by Customs and Excise to tinker - usually by challenging products' zero-rated status - have stirred up legal and political opposition and have sometimes failed. After struggling last year to standardise VAT on snacks Customs abandoned the attempt as hopeless and its move to slap standard-rate VAT on Jaffa cakes was defeated in the courts. More recently, the ending of zero-rating on freshly-squeezed orange juice was criticised by MPs. Many food manufacturers believe the system is absurd but they cannot agree on what should replace it. Most dare not press too hard for reform, for fear that reform would involve ending zero-rating. This view has shaped pre-Budget lobbying by the Food and Drink Federation, the umbrella organisation of the main industry associations. The federation has told the Treasury that the end of zero-rating would lead to higher inflation, job losses and lower industry profits. This stance has been broadly supported by the industry, but it has been criticised by some manufacturers of products such as snacks, confectionery, soft drinks and ice cream, on which 17.5 per cent VAT is charged. Mr Keith Nightingale, director-general of the Snacks, Nuts and Crisps Manufacturers Association, said: 'The federation seems to be putting all its effort into preserving the status quo and doing nothing for all of us who pay the standard VAT rate.' Several confectionery manufacturers belonging to the Biscuit, Cake, Chocolate and Confectionery Alliance have broken ranks and launched a campaign to have VAT extended to all processed foods at a rate of 8 per cent. That, they say, would end discrimination without reducing the Pounds 1.6bn a year the exchequer receives from VAT on food. Companies backing the campaign include Cadbury, Mars and - until this week - Nestle. Although their proposals suit Rowntree, Nestle's confectionery subsidiary, many of the group's other businesses such as instant coffee, yoghurts and frozen food would be penalised. Similar conflicts of interest beset other industry associations. Some ice cream manufacturers want a lower VAT rate but Unilever, the industry leader, is keen to avoid endangering the zero rate on its other products. One option would be to zero-rate all food. As well as costing the Treasury revenue, however, that would require a special exemption from European Community rules, which Brussels would be reluctant to grant. Under EU rules Britain could charge as little as 5 per cent VAT on food. But this would also cut Treasury revenue unless it was applied to some or all of the food products which are currently zero-rated. Any extension of VAT, even at a relatively low rate, on food would, however, be politically unpopular. Given the unpalatable alternatives, the betting must be that the present system, for all its faults, will survive the Budget largely intact.  -------------------------------------------------------------------- SPOT THE DIFFERENCE  -------------------------------------------------------------------- STANDARD RATE (17.5 PER CENT)  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Gingerbread figure with head dipped in chocolate  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Salted or roasted shelled nuts  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Potato crisps, potato sticks, potato puffs and similar products made from potato derivatives: savoury food products made by swelling of cereals or cereals product eg potato crisps, popcorn, Hula-Hoops, Skips, Wotsits and Quavers  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Chocolate biscuits  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Ice cream, including ice cream sold for desserts and table use, Ice lollies, frozen yoghurt suitable for immediate consumption when frozen, eg soft enough to be eaten with a spoon  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Confectionery; including crystallised fruit, compressed fruit bars, cereal bars, banana chips  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Puffed cereal product marketed as a snack  -------------------------------------------------------------------- sandwich sold from kiosk in amusement park  -------------------------------------------------------------------- ZERO-RATED  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Gingerbread figure with head dipped in chocolate  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Nuts in shell, unsalted or unroasted nuts even though shelled  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Any snack product not covered by potato criterion and not made by the process of swelling cereals or cereal products eg Tortilla chips, corn chips, mini biscuits, Twiglets, savoury product made from biscuit regardless of shape, appearance or fillings.

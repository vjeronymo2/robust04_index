			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TIBET DISSIDENTS ARE ROUNDED UP;  </P> <P> MARTIAL-LAW CRACKDOWN FOLLOWS PRO-INDEPENDENCE RIOTS  </P> <P> Suspected pro-independence protesters, some screaming in terror, were rounded  up by police and soldiers in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa on Wednesday as the  city began its first day under martial law.  </P> <P> The heavy crackdown, which came after three days of clashes in which police  shot and killed at least 11 and perhaps 50 or more, appeared to have brought  relative calm to the city.  </P> <P> All foreigners, with the exception of a handful of people holding teaching or  business jobs in Lhasa, have been ordered to leave the city by today. Many  Tibetans fear that once those potential witnesses have been removed, a fierce  crackdown will take place against those who participated in this week's clashes  and any who dare to protest in the streets again.  </P> <P> Fear engulfed many of those involved in the protests. Security forces raided  homes in the city's Tibetan quarter, arresting suspects and taking them away in  trucks, according to foreign tourists in Lhasa interviewed by telephone from  Beijing.  </P> <P> An American tourist described seeing a terrified young Tibetan woman dragged by  soldiers from the stone-walled courtyard of a residential compound.  </P> <P> "She was screaming and crying and was pulled by many troops into the back of an  open truck and driven off," he said. "The truck kept coming back and forth.  Each time they'd arrest someone. They seemed to be doing it pretty  systematically."  </P> <P> Police had photographed many demonstrators and rioters during the clashes and  are now in a position to seek out those individuals.  </P> <P> Tibetans "are afraid that . . . whatever people they (police) can identify are  going to get arrested and maybe executed," another American traveler said.  "Tibetans think a lot of people are going to get killed, and that's why the  foreigners (who might inform the outside world) are being forced to leave."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Restraint' Seen as Weakness  </P> <P> Doje Cering, a pro-Chinese ethnic Tibetan who heads the Tibet Autonomous Region  government, was quoted on China's national radio Wednesday as saying that  "separatists" advocating Tibetan independence had taken the government's  "restrained" stance toward previous demonstrations as a sign of weakness.  </P> <P> Three previous pro-independence demonstrations in the past 18 months have been  suppressed after police opened fire on protesters. Various reports have placed  the death toll in these incidents anywhere from 15 to 41. After each incident,  dozens or hundreds of Tibetans were imprisoned, with most released again after  several weeks or months. Some have been sentenced to long prison terms, and  Western human rights organizations have reported allegations of torture of  prisoners by electric cattle prods and other means.  </P> <P> Authorities now say these protests were handled too leniently.  </P> <P> "Now is the time for a radical solution," Doje said, according to the radio  report. "If we don't adopt that now, it will seriously influence our social  stability."  </P> <P> The current troubles in Lhasa began Sunday when about a dozen Buddhist monks  and nuns staged a pro-independence demonstration, which soon escalated into a  rock-and-bottle-throwing clash with police. Police shootings and widespread  rioting followed. Official reports say that the rioting came first, while  foreign tourists say that police gunfire ignited the subsequent violence.  </P> <P> The official New China News Agency has reported that 11 Tibetans and one  policeman have died in the violence. Most tourists have placed the number  killed this week at 20 to 50. Some Tibetans in Lhasa have told tourists that  about 100 people died.  </P> <P> China, which has firmly controlled Tibet since 1951, views advocacy of Tibetan  independence as treason. The region was part of the Chinese empire during the  Qing Dynasty but had de facto independence after 1911.  </P> <P> Friday is the 30th anniversary of the beginning of an abortive anti-Chinese  uprising that resulted in the Dalai Lama, traditionally the temporal and  spiritual ruler of Tibet, fleeing to exile in India. Until martial law was  declared, there were widespread expectations among Chinese authorities and  Tibetans that Friday might be a day of especially severe conflict. March 17,  the anniversary of the day the Dalai Lama fled Lhasa, has been viewed as  another potential trouble date.  </P> <P> It is unclear whether any Tibetans will dare to stage demonstrations now that  thousands of Chinese People's Liberation Army soldiers are deployed in the  city.  </P> <P> The Dalai Lama's administration-in-exile in India issued a statement Wednesday  condemning the declaration of martial law but reiterating a call for  negotiations on Tibet's future.  </P> <P> "Despite the current tragic events, we are still ready to hold talks with the  Chinese so that a peaceful solution can be found," Tashi Wongdi, the Dalai  Lama's chief representative in New Delhi, declared. "We are willing to meet the  Chinese any day in Geneva."  </P> <P> China offered last year to hold talks with the Dalai Lama if he first dropped  demands for Tibetan independence. The Dalai Lama accepted the offer but wants  the agenda to discuss "a self-governing democratic entity" in Tibet that would  leave only defense and foreign affairs in Beijing's hands. China views this  proposal as a disguised form of independence. Although contacts between the two  sides continue, there has been no visible progress toward opening formal talks.  </P> <P> The exiled leader's statement expressed fear that with martial law in place,  China may "resort to more repressive methods."  </P> <P> "The imposition of martial law reveals that the Chinese have lost control of  the situation in Tibet," it added. "If, as the Chinese claim, only a handful of  people are involved, we don't see any reason why they have to resort to such an  extreme step."  </P> <P> A report from Lhasa on Wednesday by the New China News Agency used almost  idyllic terms to describe the quick results of martial law. The agency said  shopkeepers and Buddhist worshipers praised the return of order to the city.  </P> <P> A middle-aged Tibetan woman who came out to pray at the Jokhang Temple in  central Lhasa was quoted as declaring: "Since martial law was declared, I have  a strong sense of safety. I needn't worry any more that flying stones might  hurt or kill me when I come here simply to pray."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the only two Western correspondents known to be in Lhasa were  detained at their hotel.  </P> <P> Reuters reported from Beijing that one of its correspondents, Guy Dinmore, and  Jasper Becker of the Guardian newspaper, both British citizens who have been in  Lhasa the last few days, had been interrogated by police. They were then  returned to their hotel, informed that they were "under investigation" and  ordered not to go outside, the British agency reported.  </P> <P> The New China News Agency reported early today that Dinmore and Becker were  ordered to leave Tibet for breaking a regulation requiring Beijing-based  correspondents to receive permission for reporting trips outside the national  capital. The agency said that Dinmore was fined and Becker was given an oral  warning.  </P></p>

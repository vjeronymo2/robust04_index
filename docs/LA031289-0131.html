			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REPLAY: RHINO RELIVES THE BRITISH INVASION  </P> <P> This feature spotlights noteworthy compilations and reissues.  </P> <P> Albums: "The British Invasion: The History of British Rock -- Volumes I-IV."  Rhino.  </P> <P> Artists: Kinks, Zombies, Yardbirds, Hollies, Donovan, Cilla Black, Manfred  Mann, others.  </P> <P> History: "I like it, I like it!" exulted Gerry Marsden of Gerry &amp; the  Pacemakers a quarter of a century ago, sounding a joyful tone over a bouncy  "Mersey beat." That phrase spoke volumes: Marsden might have been singing not  only of his girlfriend's charms, but of his delight -- and that of the many  other British rockers then following the Beatles onto the American charts -- at  transcending England's stark class differences through instant stardom. It was  a chorus joined in by millions of American teens, who were open to a sprightly  and slightly raucous pick-me-up in the wake of JFK's assassination. Many of  these British invaders sold us back a filtered-down version of American rock  and R&amp;B, but as the late critic Lester Bangs once noted, "This was not  quite a replay of Pat Boone rendering Little Richard palatable to a white  audience. In even the limpest, wimpiest Liverpudlian retread of an American  R&amp;B oldie, there was at least the promise, the yearning, that both  performers and audience might get loose, shake 'em on down, and run wild in the  streets, as we of course eventually did."  </P> <P> Sound: Anyone who listens to oldies stations like KRTH will recognize most of  the 28 tracks from 1964-66 on these four indispensable albums. Prominently  absent are the Beatles, Stones, the Who, Animals and Herman's Hermits, due to  rights difficulties. But most of the other significant figures of that era are  well represented, from the enduring riff-rock and social commentary of the  Kinks (one of the few artists in the genre to have any lasting impact in music)  to the wholly innocuous ballads of Chad &amp; Jeremy. Lennon and McCartney are  represented in the half-dozen compositions -- recorded by Billy J. Kramer and  Peter &amp; Gordon -- included here. Amid all the delightful pop fluff ("Lady  Godiva," "Do Wah Diddy Diddy"), many significant beginnings can be sensed here  -- of rock as a wild sexual release ("I'm a Man," "Wild Thing"), as a social  protest force ("Shapes of Things," "Universal Soldier"), as a more literate  story/song form ("Bus Stop"). Every pop fan should have all four of these  volumes in the home library. CHRIS WILLMAN  </P></p>

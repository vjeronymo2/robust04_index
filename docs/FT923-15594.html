			<p>920701 FT  01 JUL 92 / Manx government rules out protection scheme amendments THE MANX government yesterday ruled out proposals to amend its protection scheme for depositors in the Isle of Man branch of BCCI. The Manx scheme offers the same levels of compensation as the UK scheme but requires claimants to waive all rights they may have under a proposed Abu Dhabi settlement. Compansation claims for the Isle of Man scheme must be submitted by July 15. The Manx scheme was introduced five months before BCCI's collapse. It is funded by contributions from island's banks and building societies. The BCCI collapse is thought to have cost the scheme pounds 21m.</p>

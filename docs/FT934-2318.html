			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / UK and Ireland near Ulster peace accord An Anglo-Irish declaration aimed at ending 25 years of IRA violence and paving the way for a permanent political settlement in Northern Ireland will be finalised in London before the end of this week. After a day of non-stop telephone diplomacy between the Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, Whitehall officials said the statement would be released after a meeting of the two prime ministers later today. Mr Major expects to spell out the accord to MPs before parliament breaks for Christmas recess on Friday. Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, said last night Dublin and London were now 'very close to agreement'. But even as the British and Irish prime ministers were clearing the remaining obstacles, some politicians in the province were questioning if it would bring lasting peace. The declaration, designed to reconcile the competing interests of the province's unionist majority with the Irish nationalist aspirations will be hailed by both leaders as the best chance since 1968 for an end to terrorism. Its release will follow weeks of intense and often acrimonious negotiations between Mr Major and Mr Reynolds, culminating yesterday in a frantic series of telephone conversations between the two men and their officials. Downing Street officials said the two prime ministers had resolved the main differences over the declaration, but further negotiations would be needed during their meeting to clear up some less important issues. The statement will include a firm guarantee to the protestant majority in the province its status as part of the UK could only be changed with their consent. It will also signal Mr Reynolds' willingness to drop the Republic's constitutional claim to the North in the event of a permanent political settlement. But in return Mr Major is thought to have agreed to language in the declaration which goes further than hitherto in acknowledging the aspirations of those seeking a united Ireland. Mr Reynolds, who has said he would not accept any declaration which did not offer a reasonable prospect of an end to the IRA campaign, has been pressing the unionist veto to be coupled with a broader commitment to Irish self-determination. He also wants an all-Ireland convention to provide an early opportunity for Sinn Fein to join talks. The precise phrases in that section of the communique - will be critical in determining the impact of the declaration. If they move too far in the direction of Sinn Fein, they will threaten a unionist backlash against Mr Major's government and its fragile majority at Westminster. That in turn could trigger a renewed escalation in the terrorist campaign being waged by protestant paramilitaries. Officials acknowledged last night that the two leaders were uncertain if it would persuade the IRA to abandon its military campaign. One British minister said it might mark the 'beginning not the end' of the search for peace.</p>

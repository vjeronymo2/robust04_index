			<p>BFN     [Text] [Labuhn] Hans Stercken, CDU [Christian Democrtic  Union] deputy and chairman of the Bundestag Foreign Affairs  Committee, went to Iraq for political talks where yesterday he  was also received by President Saddam Husayn. Before his  departure Stercken said that his intention was to improve the  preconditions for normalizing relations between Germany and  Iraq. Meanwhile, Hans Stercken has moved on to Jordan's  capital, Amman, where he is talking to us on the telephone.  Good morning, Mr. Stercken.    [Stercken] Good morning, Mr. Labuhn.    [Labuhn] Can you tell us something about the detailed  discussions that you had with Saddam Husayn?    [Stercken] Let me say first of all that I did not go there  on  behalf of anybody. I accepted a personal invitation and was  accompanied by my colleague Dr. (Riedel), who supports a charity  for Iraqi children in Munich. As far as the Iraqi side was  concerned--and I had the opportunity of talking to virtually all  the major politicians of that country--the talks revolved around  the country's policy following the [eventual] lifting of the  blockade. The future handling of this important position in the  Middle East must not be an issue that is discussed by military  circles. It is a political question. Neither is it an economic  issue to be discussed by the many lobbyists in Baghdad hotels  where you can meet businessmen from every corner of the globe  who already discuss the policy following the lifting of the  embargo. That is not politics. It was for that reason that I  wanted to learn from the Iraqis themselves the kind of policy  that they believe they (? should) pursue.    [Labuhn] What was the reply?    [Stercken] I believe that the lesson has been learned. I am  saying this quite openly and clearly. I do not believe that any  illusions are being cherished, not even concerning the  determination of the West not to permit any such operations.  Secondly, speculation that such an embargo might bring about  political change in the country has not proved correct. I have  talked to many people, including some who oppose the regime, who  say that solidarity was never greater. If phosphorous is used  to burn down wheat crops to complicate the food situation in  that country, then one cannot expect the citizens to see that as  a contribution toward their political freedom. Furthermore,  there are many people who support the realization of Iraq's  original intentions, to permit a multiparty system, and to  finally change the Constitution as was decided at the end of the  1980's, to set up an electoral system and an electoral law that  would also apply to the future state president. All these are  things that must be insisted upon now, and interestingly this  was discussed with me openly and in great detail.    [Labuhn] Can Saddam Husayn's hints at political reforms in  the country be taken seriously, Mr. Stercken? Can they be taken  seriously, bearing in mind that this dictator has been ruling  Iraq ruthlessly for decades?    [Stercken] Well, I would dearly like to see Westminster  democracy prevail everywhere in the world. But my impression is  that politics is always the art of the possible. How do we lead  this important factor--for this is one of the most powerful Arab  countries--back toward a civilized form of relations with the  states in that region, with Turkey, Iran, and Kuwait. What are  the factors that would induce change? Only from such changes  can there emerge political change, political tolerance. What  other options are there? After all, the intention of those  businessmen who are already trying to feather their own nests is  not to stabilize the situation by means of democracy. In fact,  they will achieve the exact opposite. Hence, now is not the  time for another quarrel over oil, but for a political dialogue  that takes advantage of this hour in which the lessons of  history have been learned to promote the development of this  country in this spirit.    [Labuhn] Do you, Mr. Stercken, call for economic sanctions  to  be lifted as a precondition for the resumption of political  dialogue between Iraq and the international community of states?    [Stercken] Well, I will talk about this with all those who  have voiced numerous concerns about the UN resolutions. But I  will also ask whether it is sensible to do it. For instance,  there exists at present a willingness to conclude relevant  accords with Kuwait. We really should proceed from the premise  that without eliminating the causes of the present tension no  development inside the country itself will take place. Too few  people, and not only in Europe but also in the United States,  are aware of that. When you have dealt with the Arab world for  40 years you realize, for instance, that Saddam Husayn compares  his incursion of Kuwait with incursions of Austria and  elsewhere--although I should add that I had no intention of  discussing this when talking about the future and the past--when  he says that that too once belonged together. It is a different  mentality. What is more, we did not spend time looking back on  these German issues. The issue now is to avoid future conflicts  and wars, and to ensure that this takes place on an appropriate  and politically acceptable basis.    [Labuhn] In other words, you would advocate lifting UN  economic sanctions in the foreseeable future.    [Stercken] What I advocate is the strictest adherence to the  UN accords, namely, once the conditions have been met, then the  sanctions should be lifted, but this must be linked to a  political concept. We cannot allow this to degenerate into a  military, economic, or oil issue.    [Labuhn] The Kurds in northern Iraq, Mr. Stercken, live in  peace only because they can now live in a UN protected zone,  virtually protected by allied troops. Likewise, the Shiites in  the south of Iraq cannot be certain of survival. How can these  minorities be protected when the aim is the normalization of  relations between Iraq and other countries?    [Stercken] Well, I was shown the agreements with the Kurds  that Barzani had intended to sign. It is interesting to note  that Tariq Aziz, the former foreign minister and present deputy  prime minister, said that the U.S. secretary of state was  totally unaware that following the detailing of this accord,  Barzani was invited to the United States where he was told that  this would mean an end to all opportunities for cooperation with  the United States. All this must be clarified. If this is  indeed the case as claimed-- and I will discuss this with  Barzani--then I can only say that they are no contribution  toward a political solution of these issues. The Kurds do want  to remain part of Iraq, and the autonomy treaty that they  negotiated with Baghdad--I would say, looked at  superficially--is indeed already a great help for the Kurds, and  it is something that they agreed with the authorities in  Baghdad. The question now is, if there is any doubt about this  then guarantees must be given. But surely the path toward a  solution should not be blocked in the mistaken assumption that a  political change in Baghdad could be brought about in that way.  That is discernible nowhere. Even the dissidents--as well as  many journalists who made no attempt to disguise their  attitude--have told me that in that way no political change  could be brought about in Iraq. It must come about through  dialogue, and on that point we count especially on the  Europeans, saying again and again we count on the Germans, the  French, and, interestingly, on the Spaniards. In fact, they  seem to have anticipated Schwerin somewhat [sentence as heard].  I really do feel that serious thought should be given to this  matter. After all, we do not want victory, but we want peace,  reconciliation, and cooperation.    [Labuhn] Mr. Stercken, you are among the very few Western  politicians who have had a face to face meeting with Saddam  Husayn after the Gulf war. What impression did you have of him?    [Stercken] Very relaxed, very calm. I believe that the  general situation in the country gives him no cause for any  great worries. But I told him, do not be deceived, the issue is  not just relations with your neighbors. Kaiser William II once  spoke of many enemies, much honor, but Kuwait, Syria,  Turkey--and then relations with Iran especially--must be added.  If no easing, no relaxing of the situation comes about which,  in any case, we cannot enforce everywhere by means of manpower  but only on the basis of the status quo, and if there is no  recipe, then it simply cannot be that [words indistinct]    [Labuhn] That was Hans Stercken, CDU deputy and chairman of  the Bundestag Foreign Affairs Committee.</p>

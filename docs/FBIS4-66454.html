			<p>CSO     [Text] Sony (Norio Oga, Chairman) succeeded in developing  the world's first continuous wave oscillation [CW] room  temperature blue semiconductor laser. The Sony research group  announced this result at the commencement of a meeting of the  Applied Physics Society on 28 March at Meiji University in  Tama-ku, Kawasaki. According to the announcement, Sony succeeded  in the continuous oscillation of a 489.9 nanometer blue (range)  laser at a room temperature of 23C. The development of a  blue (bandwidth) laser was the main goal because blue was the  only one of the three primary colors--red, green, and blue--that  remained [to be achieved in a room temperature CW semiconductor  laser]. Up until now, this laser was the target in a fierce  development contest carried on primarily between the United  States and Japan but, with this achievement, Sony has charged  ahead to take the lead. When the laser is put to practical use  [commercialized] it can be expected that there will be a  widespread sphere of applications, including high-capacity  optical recording equipment, high-performance color printers,  full-color three- dimensional displays, etc.    For semiconductor lasers, room temperature continuous  oscillation is only the first step toward practical application.  It has always been the plaintive wish to achieve blue (range)  room temperature oscillation ever since the 1970s when, using a  double-hetero structure, the first room temperature CW  semiconductor laser was achieved.    This time, Sony used a II-VI group  zinc-magnesium-sulfur-selenium quaternary compound as a cladding  layer to confine the light and, by exerting their ingenuity, the  Sony researchers succeeded in the lowering of the resistance.  The threshold current value obtained during room temperature  continuous oscillation was 93 milliamperes at 6.3 volts. Ever  since the 3-M company in the United States used a II-VI group  compound not including magnesium to achieve room temperature  pulsed oscillation with a 525 nanometer blue-green color, the  II-VI group suddenly was in the limelight and research  organizations of the world became engaged in fierce competition  for development. By including magnesium in the quaternary  compound in independent research, Sony reported room temperature  pulsed oscillation of a blue laser in May 1993 and room  temperature continuous oscillation of a blue-green laser in July  1993, thereby reversing the leading role in this field.    When it is put to practical use [commercialized], the blue  semiconductor laser, because of its short wavelength  characteristic, will lead to the realization of a drastic  advancement in optical recording density as well as medical  uses, metrology, full-color three-dimensional displays, etc.</p>

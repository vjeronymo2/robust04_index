			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Storehouse sells US arm - Former Bloomingdale chief buys Conran's Habitat ALMOST A YEAR to the day after retiring as chairman of Bloomingdale's, the up-market North American department store chain, Mr Marvin Traub is to buy Conran's Habitat in the US, founded by one of the UK's fallen retail stars. Storehouse, the retail group which owns Conran's Habitat through The Conran Stores Inc, will receive a nominal price from MTLG, a vehicle owned partly by Mr Traub. The Traub consortium said yesterday that it would keep the Conran name, but planned to remerchandise the stores, possibly bringing in international designers and reinstating the catalogue operation. 'We need to improve the productivity of the space,' said Mr Traub, pointing out that 500,000 square feet of retail space last year generated just Dollars 51m in sales. When in October Storehouse announced its break-up it said closure or sale of Conran Stores would lead to a Pounds 25m extraordinary provision. Last year Conran Stores made a Pounds 7.7m loss, although Mr Traub said they had been profitable in the late-1980s. The sale substantially completes the dismantling of the retailing conglomerate built up by Sir Terence Conran in the 1980s. In October, Storehouse sold Habitat to the holding company of Ikea, the Swedish retailer, while Sears bought the Richards fashion chain. Storehouse expects to have no net debt by the year-end. The Pounds 108m proceeds of the Habitat and Richards sales will be used to develop the remaining BhS and Mothercare chains. The 19 Habitat stores in the US are based mainly on the East Coast with an image which is already slightly upmarket of their namesake stores in the UK. Mr Traub, a New Yorker and Harvard Business School graduate, started his retail career as a Macy's trainee, and then spent a year at Alexander's, the now-defunct New York-based retail group. He moved to Bloomingdale's, where, after a succession of merchandising posts, he became president in 1969. He later became a director of Federated Department Stores, Bloomingdale's parent, which was taken over by Canada's Campeau, via a highly-leveraged deal, in the 1980s. Campeau put Bloomingdale's up for sale in 1989, but Mr Traub's efforts to buy the chain were unsuccessful. Bankruptcy for Campeau and its various retail operations followed, although a relatively speedy reorganisation allowed Federated, still incorporating the Bloomingdale's stores, to move out of Chapter 11 proceedings earlier this year. Since leaving Bloomingdale's, Mr Traub has formed his own firm, Marvin Traub Associates, a retail consultancy business. He has been joined by Mr Lester Gribetz, as executive vice-president.</p>

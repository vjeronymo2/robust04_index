			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC urges Canada to face up to overfishing problem IN AN unusually robust rebuttal of Canadian charges that European Community fishermen are overfishing near its waters, the European Commission yesterday accused Ottawa of 'inventing external adversaries' to avoid facing up to the structural problems of its own fisheries industry. Mr Manuel Marin, EC commissioner for fisheries, said 'the conflict has much more to do with Canadian internal problems than with fisheries'. He was speaking after the commission unanimously approved guidelines on fishing in international waters, spelling out the approach it has urged on Canada to resolve the seven-year-old conflict, which intensified five weeks ago. Canada then claimed that Spanish and Portuguese vessels last year took 42,000 tonnes of cod - rather than the 21,500 tonnes it says they reported - from the so-called 2J3KL area of the Grand Banks, off Newfoundland. This is outside Canada's 200-mile limit and administered by the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation. The Canadians maintain that EC overfishing on the limits of their waters has depleted stocks inside them. A Canadian scientific committee in February revised its estimate of the cod spawning stock from 1.1m tonnes in December to 780,000 tonnes. The EC says even if Canada's charges were true, an extra 20,000 tonnes of cod could hardly have caused this. It adds that Canada's own studies show the drop in last year's Canadian catch - to 127,000 tonnes of cod compared with 191,000 tonnes in 1990 - was largely due to the weather. The commission says it will participate in conservation cuts if they derive from joint scientific studies. Mr Marin said Canada, however, had rejected his suggestion of a meeting of the Nafo scientific committee. 'I invite Canada to stop inventing external adversaries and address the real cause of the problem,' the commissioner said. If there was overfishing, it was by the Canadian fleet. He suggested they emulate the EC's response to overfishing, of trying to reduce the EC fleet in community waters by up to 40 per cent. Mr Marin added that while Canada was trying to make a scapegoat of the EC, it was simultaneously granting licences inside its waters to Japanese, Korean, Polish and Cuban vessels. The hirsute Spanish commissioner remarked that 'I demand at least the same treatment as Fidel Castro, even if only because we both have beards; let's have a little bit of seriousness please'.</p>

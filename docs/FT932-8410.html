			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Business and the Environment: Green maze guide The environmental industry is hardly short of directories. But the recently published Entec Directory of Environmental Technology* is one of the more ambitious, and if comprehensiveness is the criterion, one of the most successful. Its foreword, by Nigel Bell of Imperial College, London, repeats the common refrain that 'environmental issues present not only unparalleled challenges but also unique opportunities'. Those unsubstantiated remarks are too casually made in the environmental industry, given the importance of the question. However, the attraction of the directory is not the text but its extensive charts. Its 1,000 pages in English, French, German and Spanish list 20,000 companies in Europe supplying environmental technology. The first 800 are devoted to classification: water, air, solid waste, hazardous waste, waste planning and management, noise and vibration, energy, and 'environmental organisations and consultancies'. Each section is then subdivided again - for example, water is sliced into 14 mini-sections on water treatment, water pollution, sewerage and so on. The companies which participate in those areas are then marked down one side of a grid, while 30 products, such as fluoridation and desalination, are marked along the top. This categorisation - almost 1,000 groupings - is both a strength and a weakness. It is enormously detailed, but if you are not sure which sub-section you should be looking for, you may find it less helpful. Provided readers are using it to help them locate technology suppliers, they should be satisfied, but it is less useful in getting an overview of what companies do, or of their size. The last 200 pages, though, contain an excellent index of all companies' names and telephone numbers. *The Entec Directory of Environmental Technology.

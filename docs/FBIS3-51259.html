			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Patricia Uribe; from the "NTC News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Preliminary investigations indicate that excess  weight caused the Russian-made helicopter accident, in which  eight people died.    The 109th military judge found the aircraft's black box  recently. The aircraft, a Russian MI-17 helicopter imported to  Colombia by the Heli-Taxi Company, was rented to the Colombian  Air Force, which, in turn, turned it over to the Army.    [Begin recording] [First unidentified speaker remarks in  Russian]    [Second unidentified speaker] He says it is film like  photographic camera film, meaning it melts at high temperatures.    [Unidentified female judge] Correct. In my opinion, this is  decided by a technician, an expert on the matter.    [First unidentified speaker] Obviously.    [Second unidentified] Obviously.    [Unidentified female judge] Therefore, no one knows the  truth for sure right now. [end recording]    The helicopter was carrying a prosecutor and a military  judge  who were in charge of the investigation in connection with the  assassination of 14 military members in (Huican), Boyaca  Department, by guerrilla forces.    The 11 occupants were only part of the cargo. Most of the  weight was in supplies and provisions that were being carried to  the counterguerrilla battalions camped in the flatlands of  (Huican), particularly explosives, grenades, and ammunition,  which exploded in the crash.    One of the survivors, Sergeant Martin Francisco Alvarez, who  is now at the San Jose Hospital in Tunja, has told his wife what  happened during the last seconds of the fateful flight.    [Begin recording] [Esperanza Clarson] The helicopter did not  crash. It lost altitude and then--I do not know--I believe it  crashed; that is why he was saved. There was a second door, and  he escaped through there. He crawled out.    [Uribe] What did he do then?    [Clarson] He hit the ground, and that was when the  helicopter exploded.    [Unidentified speaker] No, the helicopter did not explode.  It looked kind of lopsided, like when there are too many  passengers, meaning excess weight, and it crashed against this  house. [end recording]    The aircraft pilot was retired Air Force Major Jorge Hernan  Lopera, and Juan Castillo Flores, a Nicaraguan technician, acted  as copilot. They also managed to survive and are being  questioned since yesterday in connection with the accident.    The two pilots, both the Colombian and the Nicaraguan, are  employees of the company that owns the aircraft, and they have  no ties with the Colombian Armed Forces.</p>

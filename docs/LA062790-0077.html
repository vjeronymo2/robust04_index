			<p><P> June 27, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SOCKERS RECEIVE SCHEDULING CONCESSIONS, SIGN LEASE FOR 1990-91  </P> <P> After receiving what amounts to scheduling carte blanche for next season, the  Sockers signed a one-year lease renewal with the San Diego Sports Arena  Tuesday.  </P> <P> The agreement came after several days of friction between Socker owner Ron  Fowler and Harry Cooper, who operates the arena and two weeks ago purchased  rights to an International Hockey League franchise that will play in San Diego  this fall.  </P> <P> Upset that another professional team might slice into his revenues by  preventing the Sockers from obtaining enough weekend dates, Fowler said last  week that he wouldn't post the $500,000 letter of credit for next season if his  team did not get scheduling priority. The Sockers will have 24 regular-season  home games in 1990-91, the hockey team 41.  </P> <P> Cooper agreed to Fowler's terms and will wait for the Sockers to receive  approval of their schedule from the MISL in late July before he submits his  schedule request to the IHL. MISL Commissioner Earl Foreman helped by moving  the league's schedule deadline up from early September, which gives Cooper time  to meet the IHL deadline.  </P> <P> Along with scheduling rights, Cooper also will let the Sockers retain their  office space at the arena, which was originally to have been split between the  teams.  </P> <P> "We have dodged another bullet," said Fowler, whose team lost approximately  $500,000 last season and narrowly avoided extinction after filing for Chapter  11 protection in federal bankruptcy court in 1988. "The last two weeks have not  been fun for anybody. I think we rallied the community on behalf of the  Sockers."  </P> <P> Fowler said he received numerous phone calls and letters of support from fans.  His cause was also aided by several local politicians. Councilwoman Judy  McCarty quizzed Cooper about the future of the Sockers on Tuesday at City Hall,  when Cooper was granted a memorandum of understanding that clears a path for  him to begin environmental impact studies for his proposed sports arena in  Sorrento Hills.  </P> <P> Cooper responded: "I'm a soccer fan, and I will assure that the Sockers will  have a schedule equal to or better than they had in the past year . . . They do  get priority over hockey. I'm sure both hockey and soccer can co-exist in the  arena."  </P> <P> Certainly, the past two weeks have been trying for Cooper.  </P> <P> "I'm so glad that I don't have to discuss the soccer situation anymore," he  said. "It's just such a relief to know that I can concentrate on the hockey  now."  </P> <P> The Sockers have the same lease as last season, when they paid a fee for each  game based on attendance. Fowler said they will pay $10,000 for a crowd up to  9,000, $11,000 for a crowd between 9,001 and 11,000 and $12,000 for a crowd  above 11,000. The arena retains profits from parking and concessions.  </P> <P> Before the IHL issue arose, Fowler asked that Cooper fund an additional $2,000  in staffing costs per game. Fowler said he decided that wasn't feasible and  agreed to withdraw his request in exchange for full use of office space.  </P> <P> Fowler said the Sockers will now begin selling tickets and advertising space  and negotiating on player contracts.  </P></p>

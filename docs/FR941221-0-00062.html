			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section has been revised to clarify how an owner shall make vacant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> units in an elderly project if the owner has adopted the secondary preferences  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and there are an insufficient number of preferences, or if the owner has not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopted the secondary preferences and there are an insufficient number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preferences.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter requested that the rule provide not only for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HUD's right to review at any time the accuracy of the owner's identification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a project as an elderly project, but an owner's implementation of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system of preferences authorized by subtitle D.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There is no need for the rule to include a provision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addressing HUD's right to review an owner's implementation of the system of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preferences authorized by subtitle D. An owner' implementation of the system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of occupancy preferences is subject to HUD's ongoing monitoring activities of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> covered projects, as well as civil rights complaint investigations and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance reviews.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter stated that the final rule must address the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue of whether a tenant who was a non-elderly disabled person upon admission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to a covered section 8 project may still be counted as non-elderly disabled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when that person reaches the age of 50. The commenter stated that any tenant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> who is counted for the purpose of determining whether a project is meeting its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required set-aside of units for non-elderly tenants who are disabled should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continue to be counted for such purpose as long as the tenant continues to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reside in the project notwithstanding the fact that the tenant reaches the age  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of 50.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> HUD disagrees with the commenter. As discussed in an earlier  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> response, the statute allows for the possibility of zero reservation of units.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, where there is a required reservation of units (which HUD anticipates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be the case in the majority of covered section 8 projects), HUD believes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the Congress intended for project owners to maintain the required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percentage of units for non-elderly disabled persons. When a non-elderly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disabled person reaches the age of 50, this person's unit can no longer be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> counted as part of the required percentage of units reserved for non-elderly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disabled families. The preamble to the May 3, 1994 interim rule addressed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this issue in part when it stated: ``In calculating actual utilization of units  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reserved for disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly, units  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occupied by elderly families where a member of the family is disabled do not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> count as part of the required percentage'' (59 FR 22920).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter stated that the preamble to the May 3, 1994  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interim rule imposes an important responsibility on owners, that did not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appear in the text of the regulation. That responsibility is to give notice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to families on the waiting list adversely affected by the elderly preference.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (See 59 FR 22921.) The commenter urged that this preamble language be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included in the text of the regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The commenter is correct. In the preamble to the May 3, 1994  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interim rule, HUD stated as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> [W]hen an owner's decision to provide preferences to elderly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> families under subtitle D would have an adverse effect on non-elderly families on the waiting list, the owner would be required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to notify those families of the new policy and how this policy may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affect them. The notification requirement would be triggered if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the current percentage of disabled families who are neither  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elderly nor near-elderly exceeds the minimum required percentage,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and non-elderly families on the waiting list (including those with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disabilities) may be passed over for covered section 8 units for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the elderly, or if the project is one of the few which will have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no units set aside for such disabled families under subtitle D. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> HUD had intended to include this notification requirement in the May 3, 1994  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interim rule, and its omission was inadvertent. This requirement appears in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this final rule with one change. (See new &sect;880.612a(a)(1)(iii) and comparable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sections in other parts covered by this rule.) The final rule provides that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notification is triggered if the percentage of disabled families who are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neither elderly nor near-elderly ``equals or exceeds'' the minimum required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percentage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of requiring this notice is to alert non-elderly families on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the waiting list where the owner's election of the preference scheme would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possibly have an ``adverse effect'' on them. Once the percentage of non-elderly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disabled families in occupancy ``is equal to'' the required percentage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined under subtitle D, non-elderly families may be passed over for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> covered section 8 units, unless, of course, the next unit to become vacant is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a unit occupied by a non-elderly family.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter stated that the preamble to the May 3, 1994  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interim rule makes the point that owners are not allowed to use the interim  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule to remove applicants from the waiting list, and that this point should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included in the text of the regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> HUD agrees with the commenter, and as noted earlier in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preamble has added a new paragraph (a)(1)(iii) to the rule which makes this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> point. (See new &sect;880.612a(a)(1)(iv) and comparable sections in other parts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> covered by this rule.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other Comments for Clarifying Changes or Editorial Corrections. Several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other comments requested adoption of preamble language in the rule for clarity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purposes or recommended editorial changes to certain of the regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The significant clarifying changes have been individually  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addressed in this section of the preamble. With respect to other comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requesting clarifying changes, HUD determined that these requests for changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> did not address significant issues that needed to be addressed individually in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this preamble. In many cases, HUD determined that the clarification was not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> needed because the May 3, 1994 interim rule clearly and adequately addressed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the issue or other HUD regulations addressed the issue of concern expressed by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the commenter. An example of the former situation is one commenter's request  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the subtitle D rule state that the subtitle D preferences do not apply to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unassisted units. Since the rule clearly states that the subtitle D  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preference system applies to assisted, vacant units, HUD determined that there  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was no need to adopt the language suggested by the commenter. A few comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerning clarification involved commenters requests to provide examples of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application of subtitle D to certain circumstances. This, however, is the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> type of guidance best addressed by a handbook or other technical assistance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> materials, which HUD is now preparing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

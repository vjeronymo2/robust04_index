Speaking at the reception, secretary of the WPK Central  Committee Hwang Chang-yop said that we highly estimate the  Communist Party of Canada (M-L) which is expanding the basic  party organisations among the working class and students and  other broad masses, strengthening the centralism in order to  defend, expand and strengthen the revolutionary idea, the  socialist idea under the complicated internal and external  situation and, at the same time, actively conducting the work of  supporting and encouraging the Canadian people in their struggle  against capital exploitation.    He noted:    "Our party is happy to have such true friends as you in  North  America. We believe that the Korean visit of your delegation  will strengthen the bonds of friendship and solidarity between  the two parties and contribute to the strengthening and  development of the international communist movement."    Hardial Bains in his speech said that his party was deeply  moved to see the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, who has  maintained a firm independent stand, is victoriously leading the  Korean people along the road of socialism, and deeply respected  him.    The struggle of the Korean people who have adhered to the  steadfast anti-imperialist stand under the wise guidance of the  great leader Comrade Kim Il-song is greatly encouraging the  world people for socialism and independence, he noted.    "Our party," he stated, "will stand firm on the side of the  Workers' Party of Korea which is struggling in defence of  socialism against U.S. imperialism under the leadership of the  great leader."    He denounced all the manoeuvres of the imperialists to  isolate and stifle Korea, Cuba and other socialist countries.</p>

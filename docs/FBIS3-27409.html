"Matchmaking" would be conducted for those  enterprises in puberty [qing chun qi 7230 2504 2601] so that  they might be "married" as early as possible, with "the market,  interests and privileges as well as equity" boldly conceded to  foreign businessmen.    He indicated that Guangzhou would take major action in the  transformation of enterprises in the share-holding system; a  specialized trade center for property rights would be set up.  Regarding those state-owned enterprises in poor condition, an  asset evaluation would be conducted rationally by a state-owned  asset management company; at the same time some enterprises  would be founded to purchase those "perishing" enterprises,  which would revive them through special packaging,  transformation, repair and maintenance, then they will be sold  at higher prices. In a nutshell, those "perishing" enterprises  would no longer be salvaged through bank loans at discounted  interest rates and assured power supplies to linger out a meager  existence, but would implement a measure likened to "euthanasia."    In addition, he stated that Guangzhou would complete the  transformation of enterprises to companies within two or three  years, with the shaping of an operational pattern of multiple  economic factors. An enterprise might form a board comprising  many aspects with several bosses. Should the shares of these  enterprises be transferred, they could be sold to state-owned  enterprises which were rich, or be listed by the company, while  allowing share-holders to buy the shares. In addition, foreign  businessmen could buy those shares, too.    Today, Guangzhou boasts some 20,000 enterprises in various  categories, of which some 4,000 are industrial enterprises.  Take the large-type Zhujiang cement work for example. Earlier,  it sold half of its equity to some foreign businessman, and  managed to transfer its loans; consequently, the enterprise is  developing "without any burden."    Through defining enterprise property rights and asset  evaluation, said Chen Kaizhi, from now on dynamic control would  be implemented regarding state-owned assets, so that state-owned  enterprises might appreciate in management. He believed that  the reform of property rights would be an impetus to bring along  the further deepening of enterprise reform in China.</p>

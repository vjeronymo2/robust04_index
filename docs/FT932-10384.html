			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Cookery: Light, bright oxtail - Comfort thoughts for mild days OXTAIL is cold-weather food, synonymous with sticky-rich braises and comforting, dumpling-topped stews - or so many believe. But there is a lighter side to oxtail which makes it well-suited to spring and early summer menus. It is not food for a heat wave, perhaps, but I have found it very welcome at the end of mild summer days. First, you can have it coated with bread crumbs, grilled until crisp and served with a sharp, green sauce in the manner of pig's trotters Sainte Menehould. Second, it serves as the basis for a light, clear and very savoury broth. Third, try it in an aspic-lined terrine when the shredded meat is combined with hard-boiled eggs, anchovies, lemon and herbs. All three recipes stem from the same beginnings. OXTAIL THREE WAYS Ingredients: 2 large oxtail weighing a total of 4 1/2 lb or more, chopped into 2 in pieces; 2-3 garlic cloves, sliced; 2 carrots, chopped; 2 celery stalks, chopped; 1 whole onion in its skin studded with a couple of cloves; the juice and zest of an orange; several sprigs of thyme; a bay leaf; several parsley stalks; a generous  1/4 pt wine; 2 pt hot beef stock (Just Bouillon by Kallo will do if you have none that is home-made). Method: Choose a heavy, flame-proof pot with a well-fitting lid (such as a Le Creuset casserole) that will just hold the pieces of oxtail snugly in one layer. Trim all visible fat from the oxtail and discard all but one wadge. Spike this with a fork and rub it over the base of the warmed pot to grease it. Colour the oxtail lightly all over, in batches. Stir in the garlic, carrots and celery. Return the meat to the pot. Add the onion, orange, herbs and the wine. Let it bubble up; then, add the stock, which should be hot and should come nearly level with the top of the meat. Season lightly. Bring to simmering point, cover tightly and cook gently for 2 1/2 -3 hours until the meat is very tender but not falling from the bone. Use a gentle flame, and a simmer mat if necessary, or cook in the oven at 300`F/150`C (gas mark 2) or lower. Set the covered casserole aside overnight. Next day, scrape off the congealed fat that has risen to the surface. Then, re-heat the casserole just enough to melt the jellied stock and lift out the oxtail. Strain the remaining solids from the liquid. Discard them and cool; then, chill the richly-flavoured stock. Any remaining fat will rise and set so that it can be scraped off later leaving a pure, clear broth. GRILLED OXTAIL WITH LEMON, SHALLOT AND HERB SAUCE (serves 4) The charm of this dish lies in the contrast of textures and tastes: gelatinous, rich meat; crisp, dry crumbs; and sharp, green dressing. It is served best on its own, preceded or followed by a dish of vegetables. Ingredients: The 8 largest and best pieces of oxtail cooked and cooled as described; 4-5 oz bread, reduced to coarse crumbs; 2 juicy lemons; 6 fl oz olive oil; 3-4 tablespoons chopped shallot;  1/2 teaspoon sugar; 2-3 tablespoons capers; 4 tablespoons parsley, preferably flat-leafed; 4 tablespoons mint; 3 tablespoons chives. Method: Mix 3 1/2 fl oz lemon juice with the olive oil, shallot, sugar and a good grinding of black pepper. Beat well to emulsify and pour the mixture over the oxtail. Leave for 1 hour, turning the meat occasionally. Then, lift out the oxtail. Coat each piece generously with bread crumbs and lay them side by side in a gratin dish. Cook under a thoroughly pre-heated grill for 15 minutes or so until the meat is hot right through and the crumb coating is browned appetisingly and crisp. Allow extra time for turning the meat and for sprinkling the bald patches with extra crumbs. Some of them will fall off during cooking but will crisp nicely on the bottom of the dish ready for serving. Serve on very hot plates and hand round the sauce separately. To make the sauce, simply supplement the vinaigrette in which the oxtail was marinated by adding to it the capers, which should be chopped roughly, and the herbs, which should be chopped very finely indeed. Beat well to emulsify and season with extra sugar, salt, pepper and/or lemon to taste. BUTTERBEAN AND OXTAIL CONSOMME (serves 4-6) This is simplicity itself: the reserved stock de-greased scrupulously and garnished lightly with butterbeans for earthy/mealy contrast. Ingredients: The stock in which the oxtail was cooked; 1 1/2 oz butterbeans; 1 1/2 -2 oz cooked oxtail meat stripped from the smallest bones;  1/2 tablespoon chopped parsley. Method: Soak the beans overnight. Cover them with fresh cold water (no salt) and cook until tender. Shred the meat, taking care to exclude any gristle. Scrape every trace of fat from the surface of the jellied oxtail stock. Heat the stock - there should be 2 pt of it. It should be very clear and flavoured intensely, needing only a squeeze of lemon or a little salt to season it. Reduce by fast boiling or dilute as necessary. Add the meat to the amber liquor and bring back slowly to simmering point. Stir in the herbs and beans. Cover the pan and set it aside for a few minutes before serving. OXTAIL IN ASPIC (serves 4-6) The ratio of ingredients used here gives a good balance of textures and flavours. If your oxtail bones yield more meat, increase the other ingredients accordingly and use a larger mould. Pickled prunes and rye bread and butter make excellent accompaniments. Ingredients: 6 oz cooked oxtail meat stripped from the bones; 1 packet aspic powder; half the anchovies from a 50-gram tin; half a lemon; 1 hard-boiled egg; 2 generous tablespoons chopped coriander leaves. Method: Make up the aspic according to the instructions on the packet and let it cool until tepid. Shred the meat, taking care to exclude any gristle, and put it into a bowl. Add the finely-grated lemon zest,  1/2 teaspoon of lemon juice, the herbs, and the anchovies rinsed of their oil and snipped into short lengths. Mix gently, stirring in gradually  3/4 pt of cool aspic. Ladle the mixture into a 1 1/2 pt mould, such as a loaf tin or shallow bowl, adding slices of the hard-boiled egg here and there. Cover and chill for at least 6 hours until set solid. Un-mould and slice for serving, using a sharp knife dipped in hot water and dried.</p>

			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAIDERS GET NEW COLISEUM OFFER; DAVIS DECISION MAY BE NEAR;  </P> <P> FOOTBALL: MAYOR BRADLEY CALLED A CITY HALL MEETING TO ENCOURAGE THE TEAM TO  ACCEPT THE LATEST DEAL PROPOSED BY THE ARENA'S PRIVATE MANAGERS.  </P> <P> A new offer by the Los Angeles Coliseum's private managers to keep the Raiders  playing football in the facility was made to team owner Al Davis this week at a  time when those privy to the discussions believe Davis may at last be about  ready to make up his mind between Los Angeles and Oakland.  </P> <P> "I think he's at the moment of truth," said one participant in a meeting that  took place Monday at City Hall in the presence of both Davis and Mayor Tom  Bradley. The participant spoke Wednesday, as did all other sources, on  condition that they not be identified.  </P> <P> Bradley called the meeting to encourage the Raiders to accept the new offer by  Spectacor Management Group, and after it was over one source said:  </P> <P> "I think Davis will take this. . . . He sounded calm. He didn't talk in the  staccato fashion he usually does. It seemed like he felt he wasn't in a trap. I  think this deal flies."  </P> <P> Davis, who has a contract to play in the Coliseum through 1991, did not return  a call for comment on the situation.  </P> <P> The Raiders owner has in hand a $127-million offer from Oakland with a  September deadline for acceptance or rejection.  </P> <P> On the other hand, if he is going to remain in Los Angeles, sources believe he  may want to say so in advance of the beginning of the National Football League  regular season games next month. Such an announcement would be expected to  buttress season ticket sales, which have lagged this summer because of  uncertainty about the team's future.  </P> <P> According to the sources, Spectacor would pay $20 million to the Raiders before  Coliseum renovations were complete, and $10 million of this would come before  the proposed renovations had even been subject to an environmental impact  study.  </P> <P> The advance payments would be entirely in private funds.  </P> <P> But unlike Irwindale's advance payment of $10 million to the Raiders in 1987,  which was forfeited after its failure to bring together financing and land for  a Raiders stadium there, the Raiders would have to agree to indemnify Spectacor  in some way if the Coliseum renovation does not come together.  </P> <P> The sources said that if the $100-million-plus Coliseum renovation were to  founder as a result of problems with environmentalists or historic  preservationists, or if Davis were to decide in the meantime to move the team  elsewhere, then the Raiders would have to take Spectacor with them as managers  of their new stadium in some other city, or be required to repay most of the  advance money over a period of years.  </P> <P> Spectacor earlier had balked at making large advance payments to Davis on  grounds it could lose all its money if obstacles arose over which it would have  no control.  </P> <P> Other details of the new offer to the Raiders were not available.  </P> <P> Bradley and Spectacor chief Ed Snider have expressed confidence that the  Coliseum renovation -- calling for luxury boxes, thousands of club seats and  moving the Coliseum seating closer to the field -- would clear all hurdles and  be ready for construction by the end of the 1991 playing season.  </P> <P> It has previously been stated by both Bradley and Coliseum commissioners that,  aside from a $15-million loan of Coliseum funds for the renovation, it would be  financed privately.  </P> <P> The $15-million loan would come from funds the Coliseum Commission received in  damages from the National Football League as a result of the Raider-Coliseum  Commission suit against the league for impeding the Raiders' move from Oakland  in the early 1980s.  </P> <P> Among those present at Bradley's meeting Monday were representatives of USC,  the other major Coliseum tenant, and labor leader Bill Robertson, whom Bradley  reappointed to the Coliseum Commission recently to help facilitate a new Raider  deal.  </P> <P> Sources said they now have the impression that Davis will return to Oakland  only if he is convinced that Los Angeles interests are incapable of coming up  with an acceptable offer.  </P> <P> They said Davis' reply to the latest offer could come as early as this week.  But such optimism in the past has often not been borne out during the complex  negotiations that have continued sporadically for more than a year.  </P></p>

			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Improved university standards Sir, The suggestion in your report, 'Universities want watchdog for standards' (September 26), that there should be a national body to ensure standards of university teaching and learning are maintained is a very curious one. The vice-chancellors who are apparently calling for a new national body are the very individuals who presumably are responsible for the standards of their institutions. Second, industry learned long ago that the way to improve quality or standards is to make individuals responsible for their own quality and not to impose. Third, the chances of achieving real consistency of standards across universities would be bureaucratic and expensive unless, heaven forbid, universities moved towards a system of national examinations on the model of 'A' levels. Surely the sensible route is to reinforce universities' sense of their own responsibility for standards and quality. This would be achieved by ensuring that universities were funded on the basis of the actual numbers of students taught. Then, as in the commercial world, they would have the inducement that if they failed to satisfy their customers they would not only lose them, but they would also lose revenue. Peter Watson, executive pro-vice-chancellor, University of Buckingham, Buckingham MK18 1EG</p>

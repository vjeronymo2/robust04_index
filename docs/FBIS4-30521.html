			<p>BFN     [Text] A vice premier-level preliminary contact for  historic North-South top-level talks took place today in  Panmunjom amid the attention of all fellow countrymen and the  world, that earnestly yearn for peace on the Korean peninsula  and the fatherland's independent, peaceful reunification.    With the attention of compatriots in the North and South and  abroad and the world, who hope that North-South top-level talks  will take place for the first time in the history of national  division, which has lasted a half century, at the earliest  possible date and, thus, open a new phase in the fatherland's  reunification, and with the expectations of the world, Panmunjom  was today filled with numerous reporters from the North and  South and foreign reporters.    Members of our side's delegation led by Kim Yong-sun,  chairman of the Reunification Policy Committee of the Supreme  People's Assembly, and accompanying officials and members of the  South side's delegation led by Yi Hong-ku, deputy prime minister  and minister of the National Unification Board, and accompanying  officials came to the preliminary contact at 1000.    At the contact, the heads of the two sides' delegations each  made a keynote speech to express each's position on holding  North-South top-level talks.    In the speech, the head of our side's delegation pointed out  that he was pleased that both sides were holding a preliminary  contact today after reaching an agreement on holding top-level  talks. He went on to say:    We are very close to 1995, the year which all fellow  countrymen hope will be the first year of reunification, and  leave but one year before the 50-year mark of national division  which we should no longer pass over.    However, the reality facing our nation is grave.  Misunderstanding, distrust, enmity, and confrontation between  the North and the South have been intensified, rather than being  removed, and they have been even further promoted by outside  forces. In such a situation, we were faced with a dangerous  phase where even unstable peace would be endangered.    Our people are now at the crossroads of choosing one of two  roads, either peace or war, or reunification or national common  destruction [minjogui kongmyorinya], which cannot coexist.    At this solemn point, all fellow countrymen are looking to  the patriotic determination [aegukchogin kyoltanul] of the  top-level leaders of both sides more ardently than ever before.    We firmly believe that the convocation of top-level talks  between the North and the South will be an important historic  occasion for correctly setting the direction of our nation.    The North-South top-level talks should become, at any cost,  successful talks that will give all fellow countrymen a bright  hope for national reconciliation and unity and peace in the  country and its independent, peaceful reunification. We have  consistently adhered to the position of marking the turning  point for the start towards achieving the country's  reunification through top-level talks without outside forces'  interference.    The respected and beloved President Kim Il-song personally  initiated top-level talks as early as May 1972, when North-South  dialogue first began, and since then, has paid special attention  to arranging top-level talks, which will be of significance for  the country's reunification.    Our proposal for the exchange of special envoys in May last  year was also part of our efforts for top-level talks. However,  these efforts failed to bear due fruit.    It is indeed fortunate that the top-level talks which failed  to be realized for the scores of years in the past have come to  witness their rays for the first time today, 50 years since the  country was divided. We think that precisely in this foundation  lies our common position of worrying over the nation's present  and future. We would like to believe that this position is  precisely a manifestation of the independent spirit of shaping  the nation's destiny with our Korean people's own strength.    We can say the success of the top-level talks is guaranteed  if the North and the South do not differ in this spirit of  national independence because lying in this spirit of national  independence is the supreme idea that links the North and the  South by one bond--the source of the nation's will and strength  capable of shaping our destiny by ourselves--and a sure  guarantee for defending the common interests of the nation  without playing into the hands of outside forces that make  scapegoats out of the interests of our nation.    If the two sides start with this independent spirit and the  nation's position, the North and the South will be able to  achieve reconciliation and unity after easily transcending all  differences in accordance with the principles of independence,  peaceful reunification, and great national unity; overcome the  difficult situation with the nation's united national  independent strength; and, thus, stand on the peak of  reunification and prosperity which all fellow countrymen desire.    The North-South top-level talks that we are now going to  arrange, will become the creation of a great new national  history where the history of antagonism that continued for half  a century in our country changes into a history of great  national unity; the history of confrontation becomes a history  of peace; and the history of division becomes a history of  reunification. It will undoubtedly give our 70 million fellow  countrymen a bright hope for reunification in the nineties and  will also regain the great pride of our nation which has  outstanding history, tradition, and wisdom.    This will also give great happiness to the world's  peace-loving people who are worried about the situation on the  Korean peninsula.    The head of our side's delegation stressed the important  responsibility of both sides for the successful preparation of  the historic top-level talks between the North and South and  expressed the following position of ours on the basic issues to  be discussed at the preliminary contact.    First is the issue of the venue of the top-level talks. We  propose that the venue of the top-level talks be held in  Pyongyang.    This is because when the South Korean side's president  [taetongnyon] was in the opposition party, the respected and  beloved President Kim Il-song already asked him to visit  Pyongyang and because the South Korean president repeatedly  expressed the will to meet with President Kim Il-song,  irrespective of the venue, and visit Pyongyang.    Second is the issue of the date of the top-level talks. We  propose to hold the top-level talks in mid-August. We believe  that this date is significant because it is around the day when  the North and South all celebrate the 15 August [national  liberation].    Third is the issue of the working-level procedure for the  top-level talks between the North and South.    We believe that it is reasonable to arrange, right after  today's contact ends, a delegates contact attended by a delegate  to the preliminary contact and two accompanying officials from  each side and discuss working-level issues, except for important  issues such as the venue and date. The delegates contact should  start from 1 July, and should be able to discuss the composition  and scale of the delegation, the itinerary of the stay, dispatch  of advance teams, procedures for visits, guarantee of  conveniences, guarantee of personal safety, and other  working-level issues.    Fourth is the issue of creating an atmosphere for holding  the  top-level talks. To make the talks, during which the top-level  leaders of the North and South will meet, successful, we propose  that from 1 July both sides completely stop all acts that may  cloud the atmosphere for the top-level talks.    Then, the head of our side's delegation presented a draft  agreement of the preliminary contact for North-South top-level  talks, a draft agreement that contains the above-mentioned facts.    A sincere discussion took place at the preliminary contact,  focusing on the venue and time of the North-South top-level  talks.    At the contact which was held from 1000 until 1750, the two  sides reached a consensus of views on all points in the  agreement on holding North-South top-level talks, drafted the  text, and adopted a formal letter of agreement.    The heads of the two sides' delegations each signed the  agreement and exchanged the texts.    In today's contact, our side's showed sincerity and  generosity to hold North-South top-level talks in compliance  with all fellow countrymen's earnest desire and expectations.</p>

			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / UK Company News: A bout of indigestion in the construction sector THE SHARP drop in the share prices of Alfred McAlpine and YJ Lovell at the end of last week indicates that rights issue fatigue may finally have caught up with the construction sector. Lovell's share price tumbled by 18.5 per cent to 145p on Thursday after the group announced a two-for-five cash call to raise Pounds 30m. The shares closed at 143p on Friday. McAlpine, equally, got short shrift from the market on Friday. Its share price fell by almost a tenth to 258p after the group announced a one-for-two rights issue to raise Pounds 38.8m. Both groups are currently trading below their theoretical ex-rights price. The fall in Lovell's share price will have been exacerbated by a warning from the group that it will have to make substantial extra provision against some of its developments. Institutional investors, however, have every right to be suffering from indigestion given the large amounts of paper which construction, building materials and property groups have sought to issue this year. Since the beginning of January these companies have announced 16 separate rights issues worth more than Pounds 1bn. They account for a third of the Pounds 3bn all types of companies have attempted to raise from rights issues this year. Construction companies, most of them heavily involved in housebuilding and property development, have justified their fund-raising by saying they need the cash to prepare for the next upturn - particularly in the housing market which is expected to lead the sector out of recession. The weakness in the commercial and residential property markets, they say, will allow them to take advantage of distressed sales and pick up some bargains. These seem more likely to arise in the commercial, rather than the housing, market where there has been a surprising shortage of cheap quality land coming onto the market in spite of the recession. Nonetheless, many builders need to replenish their housing landbanks as sales have started to pick up. Mr Graeme Odgers, McAlpine's chief executive, says: 'There may be no outright bargains about but housing land is still cheaper than it was two years ago.' Another reason for a rights issue is to reduce the large debts builders raised when the residential and commercial property markets were at their height. Alfred McAlpine fits into this category with average borrowings of Pounds 80m - equivalent to more than 60 per cent of net assets at the end of October last year. The classic property play at the bottom of the investment cycle, when prices are at their lowest, is to raise debt rather than equity to finance new purchases - as any home owner with a mortgage knows. It is arguable that less highly-geared companies such as Taylor Woodrow, which last week announced a one-for-four rights issue to raise Pounds 162.4m, should have increased borrowings rather than turned to their shareholders for finance. Mr Peter Drew, chairman of Taylor Woodrow, responds that he would rather have equity than raise debt at current rates of interest. The big share price rises enjoyed by construction companies earlier this year has allowed them to take advantage of the market to hold a rights issue. The problem of McAlpine and YJ Lovell is that they have come at the end of the queue at a time when the market is questioning how quickly a recovery in house sales will show through in improved profits.</p>

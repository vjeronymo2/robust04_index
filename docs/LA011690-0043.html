			<p><P> January 16, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> MIX-UP RESETS CHRISTIAN-OLP GAME FOR JAN. 30  </P> <P> Miscommunication postponed Friday night's league opener for the Christian High  and Our Lady of Peace girls' basketball teams.  </P> <P> The game has been rescheduled for 3 p.m. Jan. 30 at Christian.  </P> <P> All of the Friday night Harbor league girls' games are played at 6 p.m., except  those played at Christian. Because of the bad lighting in Christian's gym,  which is also known as the bubble, games must be played in the afternoon.  </P> <P> Newly appointed OLP Coach Yvonne Sanchez was not notified of the change.  </P> <P> "They (Christian) sent a letter but I never received it," Sanchez said. "It was  around 3 and I was at home waiting to go to the 6 o'clock game and I got a  phone call that the game was supposed to be at 3."  </P> <P> Our Lady of Peace (10-3), which lost to USDHS, 48-41, in overtime last Tuesday,  was "really fired-up to play," Sanchez said.  </P> <P> "We had a good week of practice after the loss to University," Sanchez said.  "It was a real letdown not to play."  </P> <P> OLP is led by Tammy Tavarez, who is averaging 17.3 points a game, and April  Velk, who is averaging 9.7.  </P> <P> Christian (5-6) is led by sophomore Tiffany Stutz, who is averaging 21 points a  game, senior Erika Jonte, 15 points a game and junior Stacey Patsko, who is  averaging 13.  </P> <P> Mildred Conston is proving to be the Oceanside basketball team's everything  player.  </P> <P> The 6-foot-2 1/2 senior forward is averaging 18.9 points, 14.3 rebounds, 7  blocks and 5.9 steals a game.  </P> <P> Last year Oceanside Coach Jim Stant said that Conston was the second best  player in the North County behind Vista's Chris Enger, who is now playing for  the University of San Diego.  </P> <P> "This year with Enger gone, I believe she's the best," Stant said. "When you  look at all she can do -- she can take the ball coast to coast, plays great  defense, and can rebound the ball."  </P> <P> Conston, who was an all-league center for three years, moved to forward this  year because that's what "she'd be more likely to play in college," said Stant.  </P> <P> The four-year starter is being recruited by San Diego State, Cal State  Fullerton, UCLA, Cal State Long Beach and the University of San Diego.  </P> <P> Oceanside, which finished third in the Avocado league last year, is leading the  league with a 3-0, 11-4 record.  </P> <P> "I've had more talent but I've never had a team that played together like these  kids do," Stant said.  </P> <P> Dave Waasted, El Capitan's defensive coordinator, was named the team's head  coach. Waasted, an assistant for 14 years, takes over for Joe Rockhold who  resigned at the end of the football season.  </P> <P> Last season, El Capitan finished at the bottom of the Grossmont 3A League.  </P> <P> Rockhold was the coach from 1972-1978 and again from 1982-1988.  </P> <P> Mission Bay center Chris Smith's shoe size is more than his age. The 6-6,  15-year-old sophomore wears a size 18 shoe.  </P> <P> "He's pretty agile for his size," said Mission Bay Coach Mike Seaman. "He has  good arm length and really gets his hands on the ball."  </P></p>

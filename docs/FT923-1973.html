			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Travel: Hard ride to Hanoi - Mark Hodson forsook comfort on a ride through Vietnam AT THE railway station in Hue, about 700 miles north of Saigon, an embarrassed official explained how the Vietnamese government set its ticket prices. It was fairly simple: tourists pay four times as much as locals. The young man fiddled with the buttons on his uniform and adjusted the oversized cap which kept slipping over his eyes. 'I am very sorry,' he said. 'It is the rule for foreigners.' I had wanted to book a ticket for the 430-mile journey north to Hanoi and was faced with an array of options. There were soft seats, hard seats, soft sleepers and hard sleepers, slow trains, express trains and rapide trains. The prices set for tourists were scrawled on a blackboard in the office, and the figures looked like the national debts of various South American countries. I decided finally on a hard sleeper (middle berth) on Saturday's express which would cost 419,000 dong, a little more than Pounds 20. Four days later, armed with a bunch of bananas and a bag of chicken pate sandwiches, I walked back to the station to catch my train. It was the start of a long journey. Between Saigon and Hanoi there is just a single track on which every train runs, whether it is going north or south. At suitable points on the route, small sidings have been built where one train can wait while another passes. In theory, this is not such a problem. Local trains make way for express trains, express trains make way for rapide trains and all three make way for the occasional water buffalo that ambles on to the track. In practice, there are problems. A single hold-up can mean every other train down the line waiting in their various sidings, so that a single piece of worn-out rolling stock or one set of jammed points can cause a delay that echoes throughout the 1,600 miles of the Vietnamese rail network. My berth was basic, to say the least. The hard sleepers turned out to be planks of wood, six of which were wedged three deep into a compartment measuring about 5ft by 7ft. The shutter was broken and the window jammed open. Above my head, about 9in from my left ear, was a loudspeaker that announced every town and village along the route. I was sharing with a Swedish law student whom I had met in Saigon, a Vietnamese couple, two French women and a mouse. We were each issued with a thin pillow and a musty blanket about the size of a large hand-towel. As darkness fell and we clattered north past mountains covered with forest, the temperature dropped sharply. The cold was numbing. I suppose I must have slept for a while because I remember being woken at Vinh, a bleak grimy city about half-way to Hanoi. Women walked up and down the track selling hard-boiled eggs balanced in baskets on their heads. Children in rags stared open-mouthed into our compartment. As dawn broke, we heaved up the shutter to find the landscape transformed. The mountains had given way to mile after mile of rice fields swathed in early-morning mist. Women working the fields - bent double and up to their thighs in cold mud - stopped and waved as we passed. As far as the eye could see there were houses ripped open by falling bombs and, more than 17 years after the Vietnam war, still not rebuilt. In our compartment, tentative conversations were started. The Vietnamese woman said she was training to be a doctor in eastern Germany; her husband was making the journey to Hanoi just to see her on to the aircraft. As we pulled into Hanoi, we folded away the planks and passed around the last of the bananas. The train came to a halt, the door was thrown open and for several seconds we stood still, smiling and saying our goodbyes. It was good to have arrived but somehow it seemed too soon to leave each other. Then, without another word, we picked up our bags, stepped on to the platform and went our separate ways.</p>

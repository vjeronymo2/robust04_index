			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bomb teaches NY exchanges the value of co-operation ROUGH ESTIMATES of the cost of keeping New York's five commodities exchanges operating during the week after the World Trade Center bomb blast fall near Dollars 1m, with most of the money spent on emergency services such as fire patrols and auxiliary cooling equipment. The cost, exchange executives say, has been minor, compared with the importance of keeping the markets open. The exchanges include the New York Mercantile Exchange, where most of the world's oil is priced, the New York Commodity Exchange, an important metals market, the New York Cotton Exchange, the Coffee Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, and the tiny New York Futures Exchange, a subsidiary of the New York Stock Exchange. These markets provide worldwide price quotes for a variety of strategic commodities. 'We had to stay open,' says Mr Lou Guttman, the Nymex chairman. 'There was a lot of money riding on this. If we had closed down for two weeks, I would have had to tell a lot of guys to go home and not come back. There wouldn't have been a market to come back to.' At the exchanges, which share a trading floor in a WTC building not directly hit by the blast, the week following the bombing was marked by severe problems. Traders and support staff laboured without heat or air conditioning amid repeated crank bomb threats and the overhanging threat of power loss. Technicians at one point brought in dry ice to cool exchange computers; and the Nymex and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange worked out a pact for emergency price reporting, in case Nymex's tickers failed. Despite the difficulties, traders managed to squeeze a lot of business into half-day sessions. Volume at the Coffee Sugar and Cocoa Exchange was actually higher than in the same week in 1992, and the giant Nymex traded only about 20 per cent fewer contracts. Volumes at the Comex and the Cotton Exchange were down about 40 per cent for the week, and the Nyfe turned about 15 per cent fewer trades. This week, air conditioning has been restored and most trading hours have returned to normal, with the exception of earlier closings for the Nymex and a half-session for Comex's Eurotop 100 futures. The atmosphere at the Commodity Exchange Center is far from normal, however. Nymex oil traders, reminded of their vulnerability to terrorism, have sought additional security. Bomb-sniffing dogs now roam the trading floor, armed guards patrol the lobbies and packages are examined by airport-style x-ray machines. The crisis, it seems, brought an unexpected benefit: exchange executives say it forced co-operation between the five normally fractious exchanges. 'We were actually working together,' said the Nymex's Mr Guttman. The bombing has also set off a scramble for 'shadow' trading floors. The Nyfe is refitting its old space at the New York Stock Exchange for emergencies and Nymex, which plans to move to new quarters in Manhattan in the second quarter of 1994, may keep its WTC space as a back-up.</p>

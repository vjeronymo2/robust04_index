			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / International Company News: Anheuser climbs to Dollars 317.2m ANHEUSER-Busch, the biggest brewer in the US, yesterday reported second-quarter profits of Dollars 317.2m, up from Dollars 286.7m in the same period a year earlier. Earnings per share increased from 99 cents to Dollars 1.09 on a fully-diluted basis. Anheuser scored the increase on sales of Dollars 3.38bn, up from Dollars 3.26bn in the second quarter of 1991. This takes sales for the first half of 1992 to Dollars 6.4bn from Dollars 6.18bn, and after-tax profits to Dollars 541.2m, against Dollars 487.6m. The St Louis-based company said its second-quarter results reflected higher profits from all its main business units and lower financing costs. It acknowledged that economic recovery was proceeding at 'moderate pace,' and that this was dampening volume growth, but said it was optimistic of 'another good year'.</p>

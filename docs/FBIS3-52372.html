He explained that it is  premature to set a date for this reconciliation, but added it  will take place within the next few weeks, and no later than the  end of this month.    In a telephone statement to AL-DUSTUR yesterday, Basindwah  said that immediately after his return from his recent visit to  Jordan, Yemeni Deputy Prime Minister Brigadier General Mujahid  Abu-Shawarib briefed the Yemeni Council of Ministers on the  results of his meeting with His Majesty King Husayn.  Abu-Shawarib also conveyed to the Council of Ministers his  majesty's extreme interest in maintaining the scared Yemeni  unity and the accomplishments that have been achieved so far.  [passage omitted]    Asked whether other Arab leaders will attend the  reconciliation ceremony, the Yemeni foreign minister said that  His Majesty King Husayn will be the only sponsor at the historic  meeting. He said King Husayn had a key role in containing the  crisis because he is respected, appreciated, and loved by the  Yemeni president, vice president, and people. [passage omitted]    In another development, AL-DUSTUR has learned that a grand  official and popular ceremony will be held at the al-Jund Mosque  in Ta'izz before the end of this month. The ceremony will be  attended by the Yemeni president, vice president, and all  official and popular leaders to vow at the home of God to  resolve problems and maintain the sacred Yemeni unity.</p>

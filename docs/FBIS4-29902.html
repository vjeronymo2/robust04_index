			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 18 (KCNA) -- The members of the  home-visiting group of students of Korean University under the  General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon),  staying in the socialist homeland, met here on Friday Yi In-mo,  a former war correspondent of the Korean People's Army who is  now widely known as the incarnation of faith and will.    Saying the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear  leader Comrade Kim Chong-il revived him who was all but dead and  have constantly shown paternal loving care for him, Yi told them  that one can surely emerge victorious if he cherishes the  revolutionary faith of believing in and following them.    The members of the visiting group said they would devotedly  love the homeland and firmly defend the Chongnyon organization.</p>

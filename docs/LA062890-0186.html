			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FLUOR CORP. AWARDED $6-BILLION SAUDI PACT  </P> <P> Fluor Daniel, the engineering and construction arm of Fluor Corp., Wednesday  landed what appears to be the largest contract in Fluor's 78-year history --  estimated by sources to be worth $6 billion -- to oversee expansion of  petroleum facilities for Saudi Arabia.  </P> <P> Fluor Chief Executive Les McCraw called the pact "prospectively, the most  significant project we've had in over a decade."  </P> <P> The contract, which will run five to nine years, is expected to provide a major  boost in the continuing revitalization of Fluor, Orange County's largest public  company. The firm, which was badly hurt early in the 1980s by the collapse of  the oil industry, has staged an impressive turnaround in the last three years.  </P> <P> The deal calls Fluor Daniel's hydrocarbon division to oversee expansion of  Saudi onshore and offshore oil and gas facilities, including natural gas  plants, pipelines, production facilities and offshore platforms. The work is  part of a multibillion-dollar drive by Saudi Arabia to boost its oil production  to replace slackening worldwide output.  </P> <P> The contract is not expected to create a significant number of new jobs at  Fluor, which has 20,000 employees worldwide and is one of the largest employers  in Orange County. But the company, which has about 100 engineers in Saudi  Arabia, will eventually relocate about 300 other technicians there from other  locales, McCraw said.  </P> <P> In landing the huge contract, Fluor beat five major competitors: Bechtel Corp.  of San Francisco, Parsons Engineering of Pasadena, Dresser Industries of Dallas  and Foster Wheeler Corp. and Lummis Crest Inc., both based in New Jersey,  analysts said.  </P> <P> McCraw would not comment on the value of the contract, saying that the total is  not known exactly because the work will be released by Saudi Aramco, the Saudi  government-owned oil company, in several phases.  </P> <P> But analysts valued the deal at more than $6 billion, making it the largest  deal Fluor has ever landed in dollar terms and one of the most important since  the late 1970s.  </P> <P> Fluor's success was not surprising because of its past ties to Saudi Aramco,  analysts said.  </P> <P> While trading in Fluor's common stock was heavy, with 621,700 shares changing  hands, the price surge was only moderate. The stock closed trading on the New  York Stock Exchange at $46.625 a share, up 87.5 cents a share.  </P> <P> Fluor, founded in Santa Ana in 1912, has emerged as one of the nation's major  international construction and engineering firms in the last three decades. But  it was hit hard in the oil crash of the early '80s, when oil prices fell from  near $30 a barrel to less than $10 a barrel. Fluor has been rebuilding and  refocusing ever since.  </P> <P> As part of the restructuring, Fluor ditched its dependence on oil-related  projects -- which accounted for up to 85% of its business in the late 1970s --  and began aggressively seeking industrial and government work as well.  </P> <P> Fluor Daniel's hydrocarbon unit now accounts for only about 30% of the  company's total revenue, McCraw said. This will increase with the Saudi Aramco  contract, "but it will have a lesser effect in the current fiscal year and  become more significant part of our backlog in subsequent years."  </P> <P> Fluor's backlog of work -- a major measurement of an engineering and  construction firm's business -- is now about $9 billion, up from $8.4 billion  at the end of fiscal 1989. The company's backlog peaked at $16.3 billion in  1981.  </P> <P> McCraw said that while the percentage of oil-related business at Fluor Daniel  will grow because of the Saudi Aramco contract, Fluor will not repeat its  earlier errors. The company's dependence on the oil industry led to a  $633.3-million loss in fiscal 1985.  </P> <P> Employment plunged from a high of 44,000 in 1981 to 14,000 in 1987. It  rebounded to a current level of 20,000 after a 1986 restructuring that led to  Fluor Daniel's creation.  </P> <P> In fiscal 1989, which ended Oct. 31, Fluor reported net income of $108.5  million, nearly double the $56.4 million it reported in fiscal 1988. Its gross  revenue last year was $6.2 billion, in contrast with $5.1 billion the year  before.  </P> <P> In the first six months of its 1990 fiscal year, Fluor said, net income was  $66.2 million, up 45% from the year-earlier $45.5 million, while revenue of  $3.7 billion was up 23% from $3 billion in the first half of its fiscal 1989.  </P> <P> The company's largest previous contract, a management agreement to oversee a  $5-billion natural gas development program in 1976-82, was also in Saudi  Arabia. In the 1980s its largest job was building a $1-billion copper mine in  Chile.  </P> <P> Fluor, which maintained a major business relationship with Saudi Arabia in the  1970s and at one time was involved in more that $10 billion in contracts there,  was one of six U.S. companies asked to bid on the contract, according to  Herbert E. Hart, an analyst with the San Francisco investment banking firm of  S.G. Warburg.  </P> <P> The contract Fluor won is the biggest of three related agreements that together  could represent $15 billion in work, Hart said. Fluor apparently had a leg up  on its competitors for the program management pact because of its longstanding  presence in Saudi Arabia.  </P> <P> "We stayed there as a company and maintained our presence there, even after the  big oil work ended" in the early 1980s, said McCraw, noting that Fluor helped  to build the Saudi state university and did commercial engineering and  construction jobs all through the 1980s.  </P> <P> "We were there," he said, "so it was only natural for them to ask us for a  proposal. They asked others also."  </P> <P> Hart agreed that Fluor has always had a good relationship with Saudi Aramco and  had a good reputation for its engineering and construction work in Saudi  Arabia: "There will be a lot of subcontracts that will be let to non-U.S.  companies as part of all this, and it is interesting that the Saudis only  wanted U.S. companies for the three prime contracts."  </P> <P> Fluor Daniel's contract calls for it to act as overall program manager for  expansion of onshore and offshore oil and gas facilities and to pull Saudi  Aramco's northern onshore and offshore oil and gas plants out of mothballs.  </P> <P> The northern Saudi facilities were shut down in the early 1980s, when  overproduction caused the price of oil to collapse. At the time, Saudi Arabia  was producing up to 30 million barrels of crude a day.  </P> <P> Hart said the Saudi government has made it known in the industry that it would  like to get back up to 10 million barrels from current production levels of  about 5.7 million barrels a day.  </P> <P> Production, meanwhile, continues to fall in the United States and Soviet Union.  </P> <P> The Saudis have also reported several recent discoveries of light, low-sulfur  crude oil. If that represents a significant oil field rather than several small  and undevelopable ones, Hart said, the Saudis will probably want new production  and refining facilities to be built to handle the high-priced and highly  sought-after product.  </P> <P> Work on the Fluor Daniel contract will begin in July, McCraw said, and will be  handled primarily out of Fluor offices in Al Khobar, Saudi Arabia, and in  Houston.  </P> <P> </P> <P> FLUOR CORP.

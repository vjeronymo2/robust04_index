			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / UK Company News: Lec improves 33% to Pounds 1.2m Lec Refrigeration returned profits of Pounds 1.21m pre-tax for 1991, a 33 per cent improvement on last time's Pounds 907,000. Turnover fell from Pounds 51.5m to Pounds 48.4m. Directors of the Sussex-based refrigerator manufacturer said steeply falling demand in the home market generally, particularly in single door refrigerators, meant they had to reduce output drastically in proportion and take firm action to contain costs. They added that the fall in home market demand was offset to some degree by an 18 per cent increase in exports. Earnings rose to 13.28p (9.89p) and a proposed final dividend of 10.5p makes a same-again 14.5 total.</p>

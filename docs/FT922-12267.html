			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / The Queen's Awards 1992 (1): It's more than just better mousetraps - Technology's profile is set to rise in Mr Major's new government. The new Faraday institutes are designed to build bridges between industry and scientists. But the link between technology policy and exports remains industrial productivity THE NEW government of Mr John Major is preparing to raise the profile of technology. The minister responsible is Mr Tim Sainsbury, a minister of state. His predecessor, Lord Reay, was only a junior industry minister. Within a day of his appointment last week, Mr Sainsbury said he would 'bring together the department's responsibilities for industrial sponsorship and industrial support services'. It may sound like a simple shift in responsibilities, but the word 'sponsorship' has reappeared in the vocabulary of the Department of Trade and Industry statements after an absence of several years. This should hearten Sir John Fairclough, the former chief scientific adviser to the Cabinet Office under Mrs Margaret Thatcher and now chairman of the Engineering Council, the umbrella body for 46 professional institutions. Last year, the Prince of Wales asked Sir John to set up and chair a working group on innovation to propose improvements to the links between academic and commercial research. The interim report from the working group in January was warmly welcomed by government ministers and the Conservative election manifesto echoed its proposal to establish centres of technological excellence. The new bodies, to be called Faraday institutes, are based on Germany's Fraunhofer institutes. The function of both is to build bridges between industry, which sometimes fails to see academia as a source of fruitful new ideas, and scientists, who fail to exploit fully their ideas in the private sector. They are a route for both people and ideas to move from the public to the private sector. An infrastructure for Faraday institutes is already in place. Existing independent research and development companies, which pay their way by doing contract work for industry, could be given a higher public profile. They would then take on some public funding and be encouraged to employ staff studying for higher degrees. If taken up, this proposal would be a far cry from the last time a UK government tried directly to promote technology in industry. The interventionist Labour government of the late 1970s feared that Britain would miss out on a semiconductor industry boom and set up a company, Inmos, in 1978. The subsequent Conservative administration sold Inmos to Thorn EMI, which sold it on to its current owner, SGS-Thomson of France. Last month, SGS said it would end UK production of the transputer microchip and transfer it to France. The UK still has no large domestically-owned producers of microchips. DTI staff talk of the Inmos initiative with evident pain and embarrassment. The attraction of Faraday institutes is that they avoid Inmos-like direct intervention while clearly putting in more of an effort. Mr Sainsbury talked last week of 'working in partnership with industry', a notion perhaps more in tune with Majorism than Thatch- erism. The institutes also fit in with an idea expressed by ministers in recent years of the state as enabler, creating the environment for industry to work better. This approach is also seen in the Prince's Working Group's second idea: the creation of 'Cities of Innovation'. This would be a trans- ferable label like the European City of Culture, run by the European Commission. Cities of Innovation would be used to encourage univer- sities, polytechnics, local government and industry to develop plans for making the best of local technical expertise. In spite of their visibility, Faraday institutes and Cities of Innovation run the risk of being seen in the mould of the Queen's Awards: cheap but high profile, an aid to marketing rather than investment. The awards are indeed used mostly in marketing by companies. They have done little help the morale of British researchers either, damaged by falling investment. UK gross domestic expenditure on research and development fell between 1981 and 1988, while it rose in France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the US. Many engineers and scientists saw the low cost approach of the 1980s reason enough to declare their allegiance to parties other than the Tories last month. Letters to newspapers from British researchers at home and abroad castigated the 'progressive erosion in public support for research' since 1979 and the resulting lack of morale in the scientific community. Can Faraday institutes help? They would not be a 'complete model', concedes Mr Peter Lilley, the trade and industry secretary in the last government. Morale might be an area to benefit as academic scientists and engineers gain a clearer career structure into the commercial world. But career prospects are not what technology is for, as treasury minsters might remind Mr Sainsbury. His department will be spending Pounds 350m on research and development annually and will watch British industry invest billions more. Perhaps this megaspend is designed to make better new products. If so, this is not reflected in the pattern of Queen's Awards winners. Some awards are indeed for better mousetraps such as Marconi's satellite dish. But many more are to improve manufacturing. Better mousetraps may make the world beat a path to your door, but the secret of winning the Queen's Award is to raise the productivity of mousetrap manufacture. This is the right priority according to Mr Bob Whelan, the chief executive of the Centre for the Exploitation of Science and Technology (Cest), an independent organisation funded by 19 British companies and working with government and higher education. 'The issue of industrial produc- tivity stands at the heart of technology policy,' he says. Furthermore, the vitality of technological innovation is directly connected to strong exports, he says. A product reliant on domestic buyers will have its sales eaten away by imports. Productivity may be the link between technology and exports, but again, this is not reflected in today's Queen's Awards winners. There are no joint technology/export awards. Although there is a record number of export awards, the number of technology awards is only typical for the last few years. There are good reasons for this. In a time of deep domestic recession, it is not surprising that companies should redouble their efforts to sell into more buoyant markets overseas. It is also understandable for companies to take a long, hard look at their research and development budgets and cut some of the more borderline or speculative projects. This has been reflected in a fall since 1990 in the UK's gross domestic expenditure on research and development. Cash pressures also affect government priorities. There may be demands to put more research and development cash into areas where few productivity gains will be seen but cash will be saved. High on the list is the entry of technology into health care at home. Both the government and private health insurers want patients to stay for as short a time as possible in expensive overnight hospital beds. This can be done by making use of electronic devices, such as health monitoring devices worn by patients at home which automatically dial for help in an emergency, and by better drugs. One of this year's award winners is ICI's Diprivan, a general anaesthetic from which patients recover more quickly. Technology is also being called upon to solve environmental problems. While high on the political and legislative agenda, this does little for industrial produc- tivity. As such, it does not fit in with the existing award schemes and the establishment of a Queen's Award for environmental achieve- ment from next year recognises this. So it will be difficult for Mr Sainsbury to keep his eye on the productivity ball. One measure of his effectiveness will be whether exports of manufactures stay strong when the British economy returns to growth, thus making the domestic buyers a softer touch. It might take more than Queen's Awards and Faraday institutes to win that fight.</p>

			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / UK Company News: Scholl static despite charges SCHOLL, the personal healthcare products group, managed to maintain its pre-tax profits last year despite difficult trading conditions and exceptional charges. Pre-tax profits were unchanged at Pounds 16.1m after exceptional charges of Pounds 1.58m to cover disposals and other items. Earnings per share slipped to 12.1p (13.1p) but the proposed final dividend is increased to 3.7p (3.5p) making a total of 6.3p (6p). Turnover at Pounds 151.3m (Pounds 144.4m) was up 4.8 per cent - 2.2 per cent higher in local currency terms - bolstered by two acquisitions. Those were the Scholl retail operations in Canada acquired from Schering Plough, and Gerard House, the UK-based herbal medicines business. Gross profits increased to Pounds 85.7m (Pounds 83.3m) although gross margins slipped to 56.7 per cent reflecting the changing business mix and the increased volume of licensed products. Profit before tax and exceptional items rose by nearly 10 per cent to Pounds 17.7m (Pounds 16.1m) helped by a full year's interest on the Pounds 24.5m 1991 rights issue proceeds and lower working capital. Net interest income was Pounds 2.49m (Pounds 360,000) last year. The exceptional charges, which were expected, covered Pounds 1.99m of costs associated with the disposal of the Isabelle Lancray subsidiary and six French/Benelux retail outlets, plus a Pounds 1.06m non-cash adjustment related to goodwill previously written off to reserves. These were offset by the release, under the FRS 3 accounting standards, of provisions of Pounds 1.47m held in connection to a 1990 disposal. Mr Neil Franchino, chief executive, said that although 1992 had been a challenging trading year, the group had succeeded in its objectives of stabilising turnover, protecting profitability and pursuing its three point strategy for growth. This strategy involves brand development, acquiring new businesses and developing additional licensing and disribution businesses.</p>

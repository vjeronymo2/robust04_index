			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: US telecoms LDDS certainly cannot be accused of lacking direction. Through a series of mega-deals, it has turned itself from a little-known Mississippi telecoms reseller into the US's fourth largest long-distance operator. This week's Dollars 2.5bn acquisition of WilTel means it will be able to route calls from its growing customer base over its own infrastructure instead of buying capacity from rivals. Its earlier Dollars 900m acquisition of IDB Communications gave it direct relationships with about 100 foreign telecoms carriers. But does this drive to join the big league makes sense? It is not just that Dollars 2.5bn looks expensive given WilTel's operating profits of Dollars 90m. Margins in the long-distance business are under pressure. Making profits in this market is largely about tapping its immense economies of scale and establishing a strong brand name. On both scores, LDDS starts a long way behind AT&amp;T, MCI and Sprint. The best justification for the strategy is that LDDS is now in a position to play an important part in restructuring the US telecoms industry. It is the only unaffiliated player in the long-distance market. That will make it an attractive partner, or even acquisition, for the Baby Bells if as expected they are allowed to break out of their local fiefdoms. It could also appeal to any foreign carriers seeking to form a fourth force in the global market to compete with the three alliances built around LDDS's main rivals.</p>

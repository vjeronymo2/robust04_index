			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Egyptians search for survivors THE DEATH toll in the Cairo earthquake rose yesterday to an estimated 450 people, with some 4,000 injured. Casualty figures may range higher as the search for survivors continues in collapsed buildings, many of them crumbling tenements, in poorer areas of the city of 12m. It has been one of Egypt's worst national disasters and prompted President Hosni Mubarak to cut short a state visit to China. Among the worst tragedies was the collapse of a 14-storey building in the comfortable middle-class suburb of Heliopolis. Early yesterday, rescue teams were still scrabbling through the debris with little hope of finding anyone alive as tearful relatives looked on in stunned disbelief. In the poorer areas of the city hundreds of flimsy, jerry-built structures were made uninhabitable. According to official figures, more than 100 buildings collapsed or were partly damaged, but this almost certainly under-estimates the extent of the destruction in a city where lax building codes are the rule rather than the exception. The quake hit just on peak hour as children were streaming out of schools and office workers were returning home for a traditional late Egyptian lunch. As the casualty toll mounted, the government broadcast urgent appeals to motorists to stay off the roads to allow ambulances and fire engines clear passage. At Cairo's main Kasr el-Eini hospital, Dr Khayri al Samra, the superintendent, reported that casualty numbers were the worst since the 1973 October war against Israel. Many injuries, he said, were caused by panic. People had suffered fractures after jumping from swaying buildings or had been trampled underfoot in the mad rush to escape wildly-shaking tenements. Others were trapped in alleyways. Most schools were closed yesterday as the authorities checked structural damage. Many among the 450 so far feared dead were children crushed while escaping from classrooms. Fearing a second quake, thousands of people spent the warm night outdoors, some driving into the desert and others taking refuge in the open areas of private clubs. Egypt's famed monuments appear to have escaped unscathed. No damage was reported to the Pyramids or to the Sphinx and museums survived more or less intact. The Aswan High Dam, about 1,000 kilometres south of Cairo, was unaffected. Life in Cairo yesterday was returning to normal with most offices functioning and streets filled with traffic. However, there were many citizens with sad stories to tell.</p>

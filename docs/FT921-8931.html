			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Unemployment rate falls to 10.3% in Australia AUSTRALIA'S unemployment rate dropped in January to 10.3 per cent from a record 10.6 per cent in December, and the ruling Labor government yesterday suggested that the recession may have bottomed-out. The official Statistics Bureau reported that the number of unemployed fell to 886,100 in January from 910,300 in December. Full-time employment rose by almost 47,000 in January, the second consecutive month it has increased. Mr Kim Beazley, the employment minister, said the figures were supported by leading indicators suggesting steady employment levels. 'These probably indicate that the recession has bottomed-out.' However, Mr Beazley warned of some factors that might substantially change the trend in the coming months. He said the shift in strong retail sales from pre-Christmas to the January stocktaking season may not have been picked-up by the seasonal adjustment procedures used by the Statistics Bureau. There were also the thousands of school-leavers in December who were expected to enter the labour market. Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, is committed to defend the gains achieved so far through fiscal expansion, and the top priority in his economic statement set for February 26 will be employment-creating growth.</p>

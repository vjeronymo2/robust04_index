			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Major and Smith draw swords: Electoral campaign launched with differences on economy The agenda for local government and European election campaigns was set out yesterday as Mr John Major and Mr John Smith offered starkly differing views of Britain's economic prospects. Mr Major indicated that his hopes for an upturn in the government's fortunes were pinned firmly on the strengthening economic recovery. But Mr Smith told nearly 2,000 Labour activists at a rally in Glasgow that Britain faced low growth, high taxes and unparalleled waste and corruption under the 'crumbling' Conservative government. The clash came as the prime minister made clear that he would not quit the party leadership if - as widely expected - the Conservatives suffer heavy losses in the council polls in May and the Strasbourg elections the following month. Labour received a boost last night with the release of an opinion poll showing that a majority of voters no longer fears the prospect of a Labour government. The Gallup poll, published in today's Daily Telegraph, shows that more than three-quarters of those questioned said they would welcome or would not mind the election of a Labour government under Mr John Smith. In previous periods when the government has been deeply unpopular, large numbers of voters have remained wary of the prospect of a Labour government. Separately yesterday, Mr Michael Heseltine, seen as a contender in any fight for the succession, also moved to quell speculation over the Tory leadership. The trade and industry secretary told BBC television that he had 'no doubt whatsoever' that Mr Major would win the next general election. But there was still evidence of high-level tension between the Tory left and right. Some ministers on the left were privately voicing considerable satisfaction at the embarrassment suffered by Mr Michael Portillo, the rightwing chief secretary to the Treasury, after his attack on public standards abroad. In an interview with The Sunday Times, Mr Major said Britain had the fastest growing economy in Europe and the prospect of overcoming the inflationary psychology of the past. 'If people want to talk generally about stewardship, I am very happy to talk about the position the country is in,' he added. Mr Smith told supporters a future Labour government would implement a 'business plan' focusing on investment, training and jobs 'to lift our country out of the failures and disillusionment of the past 15 years'. 'We must invest in our country's future, and Labour's business plan for Britain is, above all, an investment plan to make up for all these years of Conservative neglect and decline.' Mr Smith made clear that Labour's election campaigns will focus on taxation, rising crime, and the alleged appointment of Conservative 'placemen' to quangos responsible for 20 per cent of public spending. Mr Smith also called for changes in the style of government, confirming that allegations of 'Tory sleaze' will play a large part in the campaign. The next Labour government would use 'all the resources and all the power of government' to promote an economic revival. Conservatives take Euro-sceptic line, Page 10</p>

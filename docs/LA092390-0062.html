			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD'S LARGEST BALLOON FESTIVAL TURNS SKIES OVER ALBUQUERQUE INTO KALEIDOSCOPE  OF COLOR  </P> <P> I had flown in balloons before, over herds of elephants and giraffes in Kenya's  Masai Mara, and thus was familiar with the graceful ascent, the lovely vistas  that stretch forever and the euphoric sensation that overwhelms as you float  above the treetops.  </P> <P> Yet as I learned again on a ballooning adventure in Albuquerque last year, no  matter how many times you've been up in a balloon before, there is simply  nothing that can compare to flying amid hundreds of other airborne pastel  bubbles.  </P> <P> We lifted off in a crowd, and I felt as if I were in the center of a moving gum  ball machine.  </P> <P> Swirling all around was a kaleidoscope of vibrant color and wild patterns.  Several of us flew close enough to wave and greet each other in the stillness  high above the city, and closer still to gently touch (called "kissing" in  balloon-speak).  </P> <P> As we rose higher we spread out across the vast horizon, transforming the scene  into a stunning montage -- specks of color everywhere in the distance, the lazy  Rio Grande winding its way through fertile fields, and a backdrop of the  verdant hillsides of Albuquerque framed by a near cloudless cobalt sky.  </P> <P> Each October, balloon enthusiasts gather here to celebrate the 207-year-old  sport at the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta, to be held Oct. 6-14  this year. Debuting in 1972 with a meager 16 balloons, the Fiesta is now the  world's largest, with 625 entrants from 25 countries, and more than 800,000  visitors.  </P> <P> During the nine-day period, there are mass ascensions each Saturday and Sunday  mornings at 7 a.m., plus various weekday activities featuring displays of  unusually shaped balloons, and assorted competitive events. Spectators can take  their own balloon rides for about $150.  </P> <P> One event that now takes place around sunset each day is the spectacular  Balloon Glow. For this, the balloons are tethered to the ground and inflated.  Flames are shot into the balloons with propane burners, lighting them from  within. Since they go dark between blasts, the 77-acre site is metamorphosed  into a field of giant twinkling incandescent light bulbs glowing against a  fading sky.  </P> <P> Ten years ago there were only 250 hot-air balloons in existence. Today, 4,000  are scattered around the world, not all of which look like the traditional  teardrop-shaped balloon that David Niven and Cantinflas took aloft in the 1956  film "Around the World in Eighty Days." The latest trend is specially shaped  balloons.  </P> <P> While a regular balloon can cost upwards of $15,000, the custom-designed models  go as high as $35,000. Even at those whopping numbers there are so many  special-design balloons that an entire afternoon at the Fiesta has been devoted  to showing them off.  </P> <P> Balloonists are a fun-loving bunch, which is obvious by looking at their  entertaining creations. Topping the list are Chickee Balloon, a towering  interpretation of Carmen Miranda (complete with fruit), Mr. Stork giving its  newborn the ride of a lifetime, a huge Planter's Peanut, a jetliner breaking  through the clouds, and a mammoth replica of the book "Chronicle of the 20th  Century."  </P> <P> There's even a witch on a broomstick hovering over a field. Yes, these oddities  really can fly. Then again, at these prices they'd better.  </P> <P> For those eager to try hot-air ballooning but who have a fear of flying, there  is good news. Many crew members have confided that they, too, will not fly in  airplanes. But in this sport there is no sensation of movement because balloons  travel at the same rate as the wind propelling them. It is akin to our Earth  hurling through space at incredible speeds, with the velocity unfelt by us  because we take our atmosphere with us.  </P> <P> Therefore, if you closed your eyes (which you'd be crazy to do since the view  is incomparable), you would swear that you were still on the ground.  </P> <P> Experiencing a mass ascension, even from the ground, is about as close as you  will get to stepping inside a Technicolor dream. It begins before 6 a.m. when  thousands of people are already gathered at the dark, chilly launch site  sipping coffee, eating breakfast burritos and watching lift-off preparations.  </P> <P> At this point, the balloons look like ordinary, albeit enormous, sheets of  polyester or nylon spread over the ground.  </P> <P> Gulping the cold air being pumped into them, they lay on their sides and slowly  bulge above the milling crowd. Just walking among those lifeless yards of  polyurethane and witnessing the transformation is worth the trip.  </P> <P> Hot air is lighter than cold, and the real magic begins when cold air inside  the balloon is heated by blasts of flame from the burners. Nudged upright by  the hot air, the balloons rise slowly like sleepy children stretching  themselves awake. Fully inflated these behemoths can measure up to 80 feet tall  and 55 feet wide.  </P> <P> Suddenly, as if on cue from a cosmic conductor, the sun shoots above the  hilltops, pouring golden illumination through the balloons. The effect is  breathtaking, resembling hundreds of brilliant translucent gumdrops leaving the  ground in a slow-motion dance and painting the sky with vivid colors.  </P> <P> Once airborne, the balloons can't be steered, only raised and lowered by  heating and cooling the air inside via blasts from the burners. It would seem  that this would place the balloons at the whim of capricious winds.  </P> <P> However, since air currents vary at different altitudes, it is possible to  choose the desired direction simply by finding the height at which the wind is  blowing where the pilot wants to fly.  </P> <P> This sounds good on paper, but unfortunately there are no guarantees with this  system. One of my recent landings was on a busy street, which could not be  circumvented no matter what the pilot did -- since the only alternative was the  roof of an apartment building next to it.  </P> <P> At least the chase crew (those who follow on the ground in a truck to pick  passengers up) was there when we came down, grabbing the basket and steadying  it against any ground currents that might disrupt a smooth landing. Hey, no one  ever said this was a dull sport.  </P> <P> Once back on the ground, World Balloon Corp., the official balloon company of  the Fiesta, will help first-timers celebrate the occasion.  </P> <P> The usually farcical, always-fun ceremony includes a reading of the  balloonists' prayer, the presentation of an Ascension Certificate -- "In hoc  ascensium non dyspepsia" (which I assume means "I did not get sick aloft") --  and a slightly unusual champagne toast, which seemed more like a baptism.  </P> <P> It's all great fun, and a fitting end to an extraordinary experience.  </P></p>

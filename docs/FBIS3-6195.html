Because of  North Korea's adoption of an agriculture-is-best, trade-is-best,  and light-industry-is-best policy at the 21st plenary session of  the 6th party Central Committee on 8 December 1993, it had been  predicted that North Korea would drastically reorganize its  economic structure. Since then, it has reshuffled a  considerable number of ministers of the economic-related  ministries and drastically reorganized the enterprise  organizations.    According to an analysis made by the Information Analysis  Office of the National Unification Board [NUB] from January to  10 March 1994 based on reports in North Korean newspapers, North  Korea has increased the size of enterprises in light industry  and trade, while reducing the size of enterprises in heavy  industry.    First, the "General Bureau of the Shoe Industry," which  belongs to the light industrial sector, has been upgraded to the  "Joint General Bureau of the Shoe Industry, and the "Korea Silk  Company" has been upgraded to the "Joint Korea Silk Company."  On the other hand, the Kangso District Coal Mining Complex has  been downgraded to the Kangso District Coal Mining General  Enterprise; the Kim Chong-tae Electric Locomotive Complex to the  Kim Chong-tae Electric Locomotive General Enterprise; and the  Kumsong Tractor Complex to the Kumsong Tractor General Plant.    A general enterprise is a combination of enterprises that  deal with the same kinds of materials according to the order of  the production process. On the other hand, a complex is a  combination of general enterprises that are technologically  related to each other based on a large-scale production unit.  Therefore, a complex has been defined as a parent organization  of a general enterprise.    The reason for North Korea's upgrading light industrial  sectors into complexes and for downgrading heavy industrial  sectors into general enterprises is the result of its policy to  give priority to light industry. This is a change in policy to  remove the unequal development of light industry and heavy  industry, which is a deep-rooted problem of the North Korean  economy.    According to North Korea's announcement of the trade-is-best  policy, the Unha Trade General Bureau has been upgraded to the  Joint Unha Trade General Bureau. The Joint Unha Trade General  Bureau has several light industrial subsidiaries, such as the  Sariwon Textile Plant, the Kaesong Textile Plant, the Hwangju  Fiber Plant, and the Songjin Fiber Plant.    In early January, North Korea reshuffled ministers of  economic- related ministries by appointing Kong Chin-tae as  deputy premier in charge of economic affairs of the State  Administration Council; Kim Pyong-kil as minister of the Mining  Industry Ministry; Yi Chun-sok as minister of the Forestry  Ministry; Kim Kil-yon as director of the State Academy of  Science; and Chae Hui-chong as chairman of the State Science and  Technology Committee. All of the above are from the working  class rather than politicians. North Korea has undoubtedly  taken these steps to raise its economic productivity.</p>

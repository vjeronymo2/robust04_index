In a critical tone, the editorial noted that the U.S. high-  ranking government official who was in Lima this week on a  three-day official visit "came and took notes -- as if he had a  superior right -- as to whether we have `progressed' in  democracy, justice administration, and human rights."    The daily considers that Watson gave the impression of  encouraging those who object to "the very existence of  (President Alberto Fujimori's) government and the new  Constitution," making reference to the meeting the under  secretary of state held with opposition political sectors.    "It is not a way to create a climate of democratic consensus  that will close the gap opened on 5 April. It is not enough to  call for a dialogue," EXPRESO comments in reference to the 5  April 1992 coup staged by Fujimori in which he dissolved  Congress and stripped the Judicial Branch, while he assumed  total power.    EXPRESO -- which supports the government -- adds that Watson  admitted that in Peru progress had been made with respect to  human rights and democracy. Nevertheless, he had said "there is  still much more to do."</p>

			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MULTIPARTY SYSTEM IS LEGALIZED BY LITHUANIA  </P> <P> Rebel Lithuania became the first Soviet republic to legalize a multiparty  system today in its most extreme act of defiance against Moscow to date.  </P> <P> The Baltic republic's Parliament threw out a constitutional article  guaranteeing the Communist Party's leading role and legalized other parties and  movements.  </P> <P> The decision was likely to anger the Kremlin, which has opposed calls for a  multiparty system. It could also spur similar defiance in other republics and  encourage deputies who want to remove the same article from the Soviet  constitution.  </P> <P> Human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov and other deputies have called a  two-hour strike Monday to back demands for the Congress of People's Deputies,  the top legislative body, to discuss that article when it convenes Tuesday.  </P> <P> The Lithuanian Supreme Soviet, or Parliament, voted 243 to 1 to dump Article 6  and replace it with a clause allowing political parties, public organizations  and movements, provided they operate within Lithuanian law. There were 39  abstentions.  </P> <P> Before the vote, deputies said they would merely be legalizing the many parties  and movements that have already sprung up in the Baltic republic in the past 14  months.  </P> <P> "This issue has long been solved for all Lithuania," Deputy Romualdas Ozolas  told the Parliament, according to a Lithuanian journalist who was present at  the session. "It is only the Supreme Soviet that has not yet made the  decision."  </P> <P> Ozolas, a Communist who is also a member of the Lithuanian mass movement  Sajudis, said he recognized that most members of Parliament are Communists and  hated to give up an article guaranteeing the party's supremacy.  </P> <P> "But we should make a distinction between being a party member and being a  deputy," he said.  </P> <P> Sajudis is the most popular of the political organizations that have come to  life in Lithuania as it led demands among outlying Soviet republics for more  autonomy from Moscow.  </P> <P> Last March, Sajudis candidates won the majority of seats in the Moscow  Parliament representing Lithuania. Lithuania also has Christian Democratic and  Social Democratic parties and a Greens movement.  </P> <P> Lithuania is preparing for local and republic elections Feb. 24. Today's  decision made it likely they would be the first multiparty elections in the  Soviet Union since 1917, when several parties contested seats in a Constituent  Assembly.  </P> <P> The Bolsheviks, who won fewer seats than their rivals, the Socialist  Revolutionaries, dissolved the assembly by force in January, 1918.  </P> <P> Lithuanian journalists said the Parliament had not been influenced by recent  decisions in East Germany and Czechoslovakia to abolish the Communist Party's  leading role.  </P> <P> Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, while tolerating such changes in Eastern  Europe, has consistently rejected introducing a multiparty system at home for  the moment although he has not flatly ruled it out for all time.  </P> <P> In response to calls for a discussion of the Soviet constitution's Article 6,  Gorbachev has said this could be done as part of a comprehensive review of the  entire constitution in light of recent changes in Soviet society, but he has  warned against haste.  </P></p>

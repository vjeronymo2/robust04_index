			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Personal View: The problem of plutonium Imagine the plight of a producer compelled by government inertia and past contracts to pay over the odds for obsolete and potentially dangerous materials. This is the unenviable situation of the nuclear electricity producers in Europe and Japan - and the problem is plutonium. Plutonium is one of the materials recovered from spent nuclear fuel during reprocessing. Separated from the uranium and waste in spent fuel rods, it can power conventional or 'fast' reactors. This permits recycling and is an alternative to storing spent fuel. The difficulty is that the economics of reprocessing have changed since the 1970s. Twenty years ago, countries with nuclear power programmes believed that reprocessing would help reduce the volume of radioactive wastes, and so ease disposal problems. It would also produce the plutonium considered to be an essential fuel for the next generation of reactors. But plutonium-fuelled fast reactors have been expensive and prone to technical mishap. Storing spent fuel is cheaper than reprocessing, and a recent study for the German government shows that the costs of eventually disposing of it are close to those of dealing with wastes from reprocessing. Furthermore, uranium - used in conventional reactors - has become plentiful and cheap. The electrical utilities in Europe and Japan which signed contracts in the 1970s and 1980s with the British and French reprocessing companies prefer it to plutonium. These companies - British Nuclear Fuels and Cogema respectively - responded to the early demand for reprocessing by building a facility (Thorp) at Sellafield, in the north-west of England, and two at La Hague, in Normandy. One of the La Hague plants began operating in 1990. The other is expected to come on stream in 1992-93, as is Thorp. Some 15,000 tonnes of spent fuel have already been delivered to these plants. About 190 tonnes of plutonium will be produced by the new plants over the next decade. Large amounts are also likely to come from dismantled US and Soviet warheads. A great deal of plutonium is therefore becoming available when there is no commercial need for it. Under their contracts with the reprocessors, the European and Japanese utilities must take back their radioactive wastes and the plutonium separated from them. This creates a further problem for the governments of the countries concerned. An unwritten rule of international politics forbids states with no nuclear weapons from amassing more plutonium than is required to meet commercial needs. Germany and Japan in particular find themselves in a bind. As their spent fuels are reprocessed in Britain and France, they will gain title to more than 30 tonnes of plutonium which, if not used, would put them in breach of the rule. To consume this surplus plutonium, Germany and Japan have made plans to use it in mixed-oxide (Mox) fuels in existing reactors. The snag is that Mox fuels are expensive and politically controversial on safety and environmental grounds. Utilities face problems in getting licences for enough of the reactors to take the fuel. Plutonium consumption will lag far behind production. This has long been the case in Britain which has stockpiled 34 tonnes of plutonium. But the costs cannot be counted in commercial terms alone. Plutonium is a nuclear weapons material and because of its toxicity is a potential environmental threat. These two facts make plutonium transport a fraught political issue. This is true particularly for Japan. From August, repatriating its plutonium will involve an armed Japanese ship regularly crossing the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. This prospect has already aroused the territorial sensitivities of countries on the route. Government officials know that the policy of supporting the reprocessing of nuclear fuel to obtain plutonium for which there is no ready market no longer makes sense. Before plutonium begins to accumulate at La Hague and Sellafield, these officials should bring together the parties to the reprocessing contracts and break the present impasse. If the conclusion is that the reprocessing plants should not operate, so be it. The spent fuels can be stored instead, saving money and avoiding the production of yet more plutonium.

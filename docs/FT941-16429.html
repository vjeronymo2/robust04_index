			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / French rescuers seek flood victims Rescue workers yesterday struggled to reach four people feared crushed in their homes when an avalanche of mud devastated the French Alpine village of La Salle-en-Beaumont, Reuter reports. Rescuers using mechanical excavators worked through the night in a desperate effort to clear away the tons of sodden earth that swept through early on Saturday. The mud destroyed eight homes and the village church, about 35 miles south of Grenoble, and two middle-aged couples were almost certainly buried in their sleep, officials said. The landslide, over 600 yards long and 300 yards wide, started when a rain-swollen canal overflowed in the mountains above the village, pouring water on to a precipice already soaked by weeks of rain. One of the men believed killed had been warned by telephone of the mudslide but decided to stay in his house. The landslide was the worst incident since relentless rains began in France last month, causing at least five confirmed deaths, flooding thousands of acres and forcing thousands to flee their homes. Surging waters broke through a string of dams in the southern Camargues region at the mouth of the Rhone on Saturday, threatening the vast region which was devastated by floods in October. Access to the southern city of Arles was cut off early on Sunday because of flood-waters. President Francois Mitterrand on Saturday toured flooded streets in the south-western town of Saintes by boat. More than 500 houses in Saintes and the surrounding region had to be evacuated.</p>

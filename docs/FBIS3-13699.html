			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] New York/United Nations, 17 Mar (INA)--Jean-Bernard  Merimee, French permanent representative to the United Nations  and current president of the UN Security Council [UNSC], has  said that his country noticed that Iraq did not contradict the  statements which showed that it intends to respect the  provisions of Resolution 715.    In a speech during the UNSC's review of the sanctions  imposed  on Iraq last night, he expressed the hope that the Special  Commission will be able to put in force the mechanisms to  monitor the Iraqi weapons industry.    Merimee added that the effective participation of French  experts in the Special Commission's activities proves France's  commitment to the implementation of long-term monitoring plans.    The French envoy said his country believes it is very useful  that the Special Commission chairman faces the UNSC in order to  accurately explain preparations concerning the implementation of  Resolution 715, and to establish a timetable defining the  beginning of the probation period. He said that four months  after Iraq recognized its obligations under Resolution 715, his  country believes that the Special Commission should know when it  will be prepared to begin long-term verification if Iraq  continues its cooperation satisfactorily.    The UNSC president pointed out that after the termination of  the six-month probation period, his country will then believe  that the time will be appropriate for the UNSC to announce its  position toward the implementation of Paragraph 22 of Resolution  687.    In his speech, Merimee said that France emphasizes two  points. The first is that the progress that has taken place  leads France to the conviction that the UNSC cannot continue the  same course. He indicated that his country is of the view that  it is appropriate for the UNSC to change the routine formula in  accordance with which it ends its review of the sanctions. He  said that such a change would be through an explicit UNSC  indication that progress has actually taken place.    Regarding the second point, the French ambassador to the  United Nations said: We now hope we will have a clear idea  about the timetable in accordance with which the probation  period will commence.    He added: As soon as Iraq officially accepts its commitments  in accordance with Resolution 715--and this is what has happened  since 26 November 1993--we hope we will obtain clarifications  from the Special Commission on its intentions regarding the  timetable.    Reports coming from New York indicate that the dispute among  the UN Security Council members on the language of the  traditional statement issued by the council every two months is  still intense. Some UNSC members are demanding that the  statement refer to the progress that has been achieved with  regard to the implementation of the provisions of Resolution 687  and Iraq's approval of Resolution 715 concerning future  monitoring.    This statement is expected to be issued tomorrow, Friday.</p>

			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Minerals boost for W Australia The value of Western Australia's mineral and petroleum exports rose by 3.5 per cent to ADollars 12.9bn (USDollars 9.4bn) in 1993-94 and is set to accelerate in the coming year, the state's resources development department said. Mr David Kelly, the department's chief executive, said the state accounted for 43 per cent of the value of Australia's resource exports of ADollars 29.8bn, 44 per cent of Australian mineral production, 29 per cent of petroleum production and 57 per cent of new mining investment. Mr Kelly said exports to Asia continued to grow strongly. Resource exports to China and Korea rose 26 per cent to ADollars 911m and ADollars 1.16bn respectively. Exports to Taiwan grew 13 per cent to ADollars 369m. However, exports to Japan fell 0.4 per cent to ADollars 3.6bn, reflecting Japanese economic conditions and lower iron ore and gas prices.</p>

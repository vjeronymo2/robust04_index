			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / Storms block Shetland salvage HEAVY seas and high winds around Shetland again blocked attempts to remove the oil remaining on the tanker Braer yesterday and hampered efforts to deal with the pollution caused by the disaster. Although the ship has not broken apart, salvage specialists believe this will eventually happen. Experts who flew over the tanker yesterday now believe that no further oil is leaking from the vessel, which may still contain as much as half of its 84,000-tonne cargo. But oil is still spreading northwards for about 25 miles up the west coast of the main Shetland island. Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, and Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, will both make statements to the Commons about the disaster today. About 600 people living within a two-mile radius of the wreck will have liver and respiratory checks this week after fears that pollution from the Braer may be toxic, and protective masks were yesterday issued to crofters living near the scene. Yesterday Shetland salmon farmers received a boost when the supermarket group Safeway said it would continue to buy farmed Shetland salmon after a company official visited fish farms and environmental specialists on the islands. Last Friday Marks and Spencer announced that it would stop buying Shetland salmon as 'a temporary precautionary measure'. Other food retailers are monitoring the situation. The Shetland salmon farming industry is one of the sectors of the islands' economy most threatened by the disaster. Since Friday the salmon farmers have been prohibited from harvesting salmon in a 400 square mile area under a ban ordered by the Scottish Office. The ban, which also covers the catching of sea fish, was announced just after the islands' fishing and fish-farming organisations had declared their own ban. There are 16 salmon farms in the area covered by the ban, accounting for about a quarter of Shetland's salmon production which last year totalled 10,000 tonnes. Shetland council said yesterday that it was retaining the solicitors Penningtons to represent it in dealing with legal issues arising from the incident. The council has initiated no legal action so far. High winds caused by the near-record atmospheric depression between north-west Scotland and Iceland battered Britain yesterday. At Renfrew in Scotland the River Clyde burst its banks at high tide and flooding also hit Lochgilphead and Tarbert in Argyll. Coastguards expected force 12 storms to hit the area around Orkney and Shetland. Other badly hit areas were Oxfordshire, Sussex, Surrey, Kent, Hampshire and Somerset, while in Essex beaches and seafronts were closed at Jaywick Sands and Southend.</p>

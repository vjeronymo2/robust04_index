			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Regulator cautions on banks' code A warning shot about the way that banks treat small-business customers was fired yesterday by Mr Laurence Shurman, the banking ombudsman, as he revealed that the highest award - more than Pounds 80,000 - made under the ombudsman scheme last year had been to a small company. Mr Shurman, publishing his annual report, called for the code of banking practice to be extended to small-business customers, as the ombudsman scheme had been. He said the award of Pounds 81,700 arose from a complicated investigation of a property development project. It was one of the first cases to be raised under the ombudsman scheme since it was widened in January to include complaints by small businesses. The bank had offered a loan facility to the borrower and withdrawn it after the borrower was already committed. 'The bank was not entitled to withdraw the facility as it did and when it did,' Mr Shurman said, 'and the resulting loss to the complainant was the responsibility of the bank.' In his report Mr Shurman again underlines comments he made to the committee reviewing the code of banking practice. He said that regardless of banks' own individual codes for dealing with small businesses, the scope of the official code of practice should be widened to small businesses.</p>

			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Arts: The Kocian Quartet and Welser-Most - Music in London How much shall circumstances in which a work was created affect our response to it? Such was the question which might have arisen at the Kocian Quartet's rivetingly played recital (sponsored by the David Cohen Charitable Trust) at the Wigmore Hall on Monday, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the premature deaths of four of Czechoslovakia's most intriguing composers. In the event, the music was of such fascination that no special pleading was needed. All of them were internees in the Nazi-commandeered ghetto of Terezn near Prague where, to convince outsiders that all was well in the Jewish community, the authorities promoted vigorous artistic activity. Ironically, this 'liberal attitude' was the catalyst to music of a radicalism outlawed in Germany itself and of a quality comparable to that of their contemporaries Schoenberg, Bartok and Janacek. Of the four the best known is probably the Polish-born Viktor Ullmann. His opera The Emperor of Atlantis was performed in London only a year or two back and his Third String Quartet fully confirmed the favourable impression made then. Like Pavel Haas' more expansive Third String Quartet with which it was paired in the concert's second half, Ullmann's quartet is pervaded by that wistful Viennese weltschmerz found in Mahler and early Schoenberg, yet in its quixotic reversals of mood and sardonic humour offers something distinctly personal and unnerving. So too does the Trio of Gideon Klein, only 26 when he died, a concise, folk-inflected study a la Bartok. Its cool objectivity seems to belie the crisis situation of its origins, a characteristic of Hans Krasa's sometimes quirky Theme with Variations. Strangely perhaps, the greatest emotional intensity was to be heard not from the Terezn period but in music composed over 20 years earlier, Krasa's String Quartet of 1921, an ambitious summation of all the main compositional trends of its time. With its post-modernish references to the Brahms 'Lullaby' and 'Silent Night' it might have been written yesterday.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Top Secret" program: Video report entitled "The </F> Nuclear Button" by Artem Borovik, identified by caption; figures  in brackets denote broadcast time in GMT in hours, minutes, and  seconds]    [Excerpts] [192245 thru 192420 -- introductory passage  omitted]    [192420] [Borovik over video of himself accompanied by two  others, one in uniform, arriving at missile base] A few weeks  ago our camera crew visited a Russian nuclear missile base  located a few hours' traveling time from Moscow. We traveled  first by train and then by military helicopter, and finally we  arrived at the launch site, where an SS-17 missile with a  multiple warhead is concealed in a silo. It is targeted on the  Warren U.S. nuclear missile base located near the city of  Cheyenne in Wyoming State -- the headquarters of (Dirk  Jamieson), a U.S. 3-star general who commands land-based  strategic missile forces. This missile would take 30 minutes to  reach Warren base.    General Gribov, commander of this Russian missile division,  descended with our camera crew to his underground labyrinth,  which is well protected against the consequences of a nuclear  explosion. It is possible to descend even further to reach the  combat control console, from which 10 missiles can be launched,  one of which we have just seen. [video shows Borovik proceeding  along an underground corridor. An overhead inscription reads:  "Command Post of Military Unit No. 14264"] The officers on  duty here spend hundreds of hours a year in these nuclear  underground corridors. Every time before they come on duty they  have to pass a test to demonstrate their precise knowledge of  the functioning of this equipment and the sequence of all their  actions. They also have to undergo thorough medical and  psychiatric tests several times a year, and routine checks prior  to every duty tour. The fate of our planet is in these people's  hands. They are not told where their missiles are targeted.  Division Commander General Gribov also prefers not to know,  although he is fully entitled to this knowledge. When a launch  command goes out, our missile men know exactly how to  distinguish between a training command and a combat command,  while U.S. officers on duty at similar consoles are not told by  their commanders which is a training command and which is for  real.    Such missile army divisions are scattered throughout Russia  and also Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan. Invisible nerves  link them to a single nuclear center which is located a  25-minute drive from the Triumphal Arch [video show arch) to the  west of Moscow at a place called Vlasikha. The missile men told  us that in the last century there was an estate here whose owner  was popularly known as "Vlasikha." Only a few years ago these  roads and traffic along them were controlled by our  counterintelligence. Outsiders could not pass here without  being stopped.    This whole vast nuclear mechanism of the former Soviet Union  comprising many thousands of land-based missiles is under the  command of Colonel General Igor Sergeyev, commander in chief of  the Strategic Missile Forces. [192700] [video shows missile  site, silo, underground bunkers, commander saluting departing  television crew, triumphal arch, road to Vlasikha, Sergeyev  being interviewed]    [192701 thru 200800 -- passage omitted consisting of brief  biographical data of Igor Sergeyev; explanation of the  differences between Russian and U.S. strategic missile forces;  interview with Sergeyev interspersed with highlights of his  recent visit to the United States where he was met by General  Butler, hosted in the Pentagon, and shown Strategic Command  facilities; comments by Doctor of Historical Sciences Aleksey  Arbatov, resident expert of "Top Secret" program; reception poor  to worthless toward end]</p>

			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Switching operation upsets equities LONDON'S equity market refused stubbornly to build on Wednesday's late rally and ended a difficult day marginally lower on balance amid ominous rumours that a number of the big international institutions had been switching funds out of UK equities and into German equities and bonds. The two markets were easily the top performers in the world, with dealers in London still taking the view that there is scope for further interest rate cuts in the near future. The German market's latest burst of strength was said to have been the catalyst for a good showing by French equities. London, however, struggled throughout the day, with dealers increasingly suspicious that a series of hefty selling programmes in London could have represented the shift of funds from the UK to the Continent. 'There is no doubt that there has been some big selling of the leaders, via the cash market and the futures, and the story is that the cash is moving out to Germany,' said one leading London dealer. There were also rumours circulating in London of further big rights issues in the pipeline, although there were no obvious candidates being put forward yesterday. The FT-SE 100 Index, which staged a good rally late on Wednesday, made a promising start to the session, opening some three points higher at 2,851.3 in spite of intermittent bouts of profit-taking, and moved up to touch the day's highest level of 2,855.7 for a rise of 7.4 as the morning session drew to a close. Afternoon trading, however, brought a complete reversal in sentiment in London, with the FT-SE 100 future coming under pressure and the underlying market embarking on a gradual decline which saw the Footsie fall to the day's low of 2,842.2. Wall Street's strong opening performance failed to prevent the late slide in UK share prices. A flurry of bear closing in the last few minutes of the trading session saw the index end a difficult day a net 2.4 off at 2,845.9. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index performed much better than the senior index, closing 6.5 higher at 3,226.4, indicating, according to dealers, that institutions had carried out their initial switching via the highly liquid blue chip stocks. A similar reaction in the second-liners is expected shortly. Equity market specialists pointed out that the shift in sentiment in the market, and the sudden turnround, was accompanied by a sharp increase in volumes in the market. Turnover yesterday was 577.6m shares, almost matching Wednesday's 586m and ahead of Tuesday's 554.3m and Monday's dismal 384m. The value of customer business on Wednesday moved back above Pounds 1bn, the level at which London's securities industry is seen to move into profitability. On the first two trading days this week turnover reached Pounds 761m and Pounds 960m respectively. A dismal day for the leisure sector began with a profits warning from EuroDisney, prompting a big slide in the shares, and ended with a disastrous statement from Owners Abroad, which only survived a takeover attempt from fellow holiday company Airtours last March by the narrowest of margins. Talk in the market last night suggested deep unease over Owners' tactics in fending off the Airtours bid.</p>

			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: It's go for gilts THE PATTERN of post-war years, when inflation eroded conventional fixed-interest values, could now be changing. At present rates, conventional gilts offer a positive real yield after inflation. Above all, they offer security - even the investor of modest means can have certificates issued by the Bank of England, knowing that it guarantees his income payments and to repay the face value of his certificate on the due date. Conventional gilts form the first three groups under the heading 'British Funds' in the Financial Times' London Share Service pages. All can be bought through a bank or stockbroker. If you (or your spouse) are non-taxpayers, you should consider the restricted range of gilts on offer from the post office; such gilts pay interest gross. New issues are advertised occasionally and these are the only stocks on offer direct from the Bank of England. In the short term, gilt prices tend to fluctuate in the opposite direction to interest rates. When rates rise, gilt prices fall, and vice-versa. In long-term planning, concentrate on the maturity and income guarantees rather than the fluctuations. Plan to make few changes to your portfolio; either hold the gilts to maturity or replace the stock prior to maturity if fluctuations have thrown up capital profits. The chart shows four major options; you can design intermediate ones by blending different stocks. Since you are dealing with certainty, though, very few stocks will be needed compared with an equity portfolio. In the order they appear in the chart, the three usual options are: Current coupons - bought at about maturity value and enabling you to lock into interest rates for a chosen time period. At present prices, such bonds are yielding between 9 and 9 1/2 per cent. High coupons - taking extra income but at the expense of a capital loss when held to maturity, since such bonds trade above face value. Low coupons - exchanging some income into tax-free capital gain. Provided you respect the guarantees and wait patiently for them, these options cover many investment needs. If you are fortunate enough to have sufficient capital to generate more income than you need, then a fourth option arises: Surplus income - can be saved and will, therefore, earn extra income in future. If you can save more than the rate of inflation, then you will inflation-proof both your capital base and your income. Conventional gilts are the low-risk home for your capital par excellence. For longer-time horizons, I also favour US treasury bonds; but the guarantees are then in dollars and exchange rate movements are, therefore, an additional risk.

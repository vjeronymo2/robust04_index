			<p><P> June 6, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GUNSHOT NARROWLY MISSES OFFICER'S HEAD  </P> <P> A Burbank police officer narrowly escaped death when a gang member fired a gun  at him from close range, so close that the officer's face was burned by  gunpowder, but the bullet missed, authorities said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Officer Brent Ambrose, 27, was treated for facial burns after the 11:45 p.m.  incident Monday at an apartment complex in the 600 block of East Angeleno  Avenue.  </P> <P> Michael A. Miller, 24, a South-Central Los Angeles gang member who barricaded  himself in an apartment where he had attempted to rob three women, later  surrendered and was charged Tuesday with attempted murder of a police officer,  assault and attempted robbery, Sgt. Don Goldberg said.  </P> <P> The incident began when a mother and her two daughters awoke while Miller was  ransacking their apartment, Goldberg said. One woman called police and then  fled from the apartment. A second was held at gunpoint by Miller but when he  was distracted, she jumped through a window. Police said Miller fired a shot at  the woman but missed. The third woman hid under a bed while Miller roamed the  apartment looking for valuables.  </P> <P> Police surrounded the apartment and called for Miller to surrender. He  allegedly walked to a door where Ambrose was positioned, opened it and fired a  shot at the officer before going back inside. No shots were returned by police  because of the woman who remained inside. A short time later, after police  talked to Miller on the phone, he surrendered. He was being held without bail  at the Burbank Jail.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 8, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ON THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> GOLF GROUP TO SEEK ROLE IN OLYMPICS  </P> <P> An international golf association has been formed to seek a place for the sport  in the Olympics for the first time since 1904, officials said today.  </P> <P> An application was made in February to include golf as a demonstration sport at  the 1992 Summer Games in Barcelona, Spain, but Olympic rules stipulate a sport  must have an international governing body.  </P> <P> Because golf has several professional and amateur organizations but none that  could speak for the entire sport, the World Golf Assn. was created. It has 30  member nations.  </P> <P> "For more than seven years I have been fighting for the recognition of golf as  an Olympic sport," WGA President Claude-Roger Cartier of France said. "I hope  that through the World Golf Association this moment has come."  </P> <P> Golf was contested in the 1900 Olympics in Paris and the 1904 Games in St.  Louis.  </P></p>

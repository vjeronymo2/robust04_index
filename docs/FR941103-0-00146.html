The Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) may open refuge areas to hunting and/or fishing upon a determination that such uses are compatible with the purpose(s) for which the refuge was established, and that funds are available for development, operation, and maintenance of a hunting or fishing program. The action must also be in accordance with provisions of all laws applicable to the areas, must be consistent with the principles of sound wildlife management, and must otherwise be in the public interest. This rulemaking opens Rock Lake National Wildlife Refuge to deer hunting. The hunt will be in accordance with State regulations pertaining to archery and firearms deer hunting, and as illustrated in the North Dakota Hunting Guide (1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A proposed rule was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on July 15, 1994 (59 FR 36348) and public comments were solicited.

Specifically, Section 4(d)(1)(A) of the NWRSAA authorizes the Secretary to permit the use of any areas within the National Wildlife Refuge System (Refuge System) for any purpose, including but not limited to hunting, fishing, public recreation and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accommodations, and access, when he determines that such uses are compatible with the purposes for which each refuge was established. The Service administers the Refuge System on behalf of the Secretary. The RRA gives the Secretary additional authority to administer refuge areas within the Refuge System for public recreation as an appropriate incidental or secondary use only to the extent that it is practicable and not inconsistent with the primary purposes for which the refuges were established. In addition, prior to opening refuges to hunting or fishing under this Act, the Secretary is required to determine that funds are available for the development, operation, and maintenance of the permitted forms of recreation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Opening Package  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In preparation for this opening, the refuge unit has included in its ``openings package'' for Regional review and approval from the Washington Office the following documents: a hunting/fishing plan; an environmental assessment; a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI); a Section 7 evaluation or statement, pursuant to the Endangered Species Act, that these openings are not likely to adversely affect a listed species or critical habitat; and a letter of concurrence from the affected States. From a review of the totality of these documents, the Secretary has determined that the opening of the Rock Lake National Wildlife Refuge to deer hunting is compatible with the principles of sound wildlife management and will otherwise be in the public interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with the NWRSAA and the RRA, the Secretary has also determined that this opening for deer hunting is compatible and consistent with the primary purposes for which the refuge was established, and that funds are available to administer the programs. A brief description of the hunting program is as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Rock Lake National Wildlife Refuge  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Rock Lake National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) is a 5,587 acre easement refuge located in Towner County, North Dakota. The refuge was established in 1939 by an Executive Order as a refuge and breeding ground for migratory birds and other wildlife. The refuge is administered by the Service's Devils Lake Wetland Management District, located in Devils Lake, North Dakota. Rock Lake NWR occupies lands that were formed by glacial activity several million years ago. The glacial drift moraine running through North Dakota is characterized by rolling grasslands interspersed with small closed basins. Devils Lake is typical of this area. Principal wildlife found on Rock Lake NWR includes geese, ducks, various non-game bird species, white-tailed deer, muskrat, mink and fox. Bald eagles, whooping cranes, and peregrine falcons use the area on an occasional basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> December 26, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> MALL WALKERS SHOP FOR NEW LEASE ON LIFE;  </P> <P> THOUSAND OAKS: SENIOR CITIZENS STARTED DOING THEIR LAPS AT THE OAKS MALL ABOUT  1 1/2 YEARS AGO.  </P> <P> Five hundred miles. To the 60- and 70-something generation who stroll with  Elinor Welch through The Oaks Mall, the fact that the 67-year-old had walked  the equivalent of 1,000 laps around the shopping center was simply incredible.  </P> <P> "The first time I walked here, I thought I was never going to make it," Welch  said one recent day, a patina of sweat on her forehead. More than 1 1/2 years  ago, a few laps would make her legs and feet sore, and she was completely out  of breath.  </P> <P> "You just really knew you were out of shape," she said.  </P> <P> Today, the gray-haired matron thinks nothing about the three miles or more she  does around the mall every other day. She walks at a fast clip.  </P> <P> There are no skinny dance instructors here, no loud music blaring from  speakers. And most of the participants will admit that they haven't seen the  latest aerobic fashions.  </P> <P> But the climate-controlled mall has become a gymnasium for Mall Walkers, a  sturdy group of seniors who organized more than 1 1/2 years ago.  </P> <P> Instead of strolling leisurely, they stride, outfitted with shoes designed  specifically for walking, pulse-counters and Walkmans, eyes pointed  purposefully forward.  </P> <P> Experts say walking is good for the heart and easier on the body than jogging.  There is also a social element to fast-paced walking.  </P> <P> Most of the gray-haired gliders exercise early in the morning before shoppers  crowd the aisles.  </P> <P> The 25 or so senior citizens who choose to make the mall their regular morning  walk say they prefer the slick floors of the shopping center to the tree-lined  paths of their own neighborhoods.  </P> <P> "My neighborhood is not safe for me to walk in," Welch said.  </P> <P> In the summer, air-conditioning cools the building; in the winter, there is  insulation from freezing weather.  </P> <P> Some of them, such as Carleen Binkley, 66, do it to keep from getting bored.  </P> <P> "I found out since retiring that you must keep active," said Binkley, a former  school cafeteria worker. "It's an incentive to get up and get out. Even if you  are by yourself, people will wave and say hello."  </P> <P> Binkley and Laura Myszka, 66, can be seen every other morning doing laps at a  fast 5 m.p.h. around the mall. Every lap is half a mile, and each completes at  least two miles every other day.  </P> <P> "We're the fastest," Myszka said. "They call us the speed demons."  </P> <P> After logging nine miles a week, Myszka said, she was recently commended by her  doctor. "He said it was the best thing I could be doing."  </P> <P> A younger generation of walkers has also been drawn to the mall. One  42-year-old said she comes each morning to exercise before working at her  part-time job as an accountant.  </P> <P> "I used to bike and run, but this is easier on my feet," Susan Atcherly said.  "But these people make me feel positively lazy. Look at them go."  </P> <P> Indeed, most of the people who frequent the mall have become friends. They talk  animatedly while working up a sweat. Others can be seen wearing the necklaces  that proclaim them as 500- or 100-mile walkers.  </P> <P> Afterward, some gather at a fast-food restaurant to drink coffee and plan  excursions together.  </P> <P> "There's old, and then there's old," Binkley said. "Here I think we're all  young."  </P></p>

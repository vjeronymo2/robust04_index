			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By unidentified BELINFORM-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Minsk, 28 Jan -- Almost 800 Belarusian Air Force  pilots have left the Armed Forces of Belarus and are now  guarding the skies of Russia. Those who have left accounted for  60 percent of air crews of the Belarus Air Force, the RESPUBLIKA  government newspaper reports today.    The Belarus Airborne Assault Troops have also been  considerably weakened by the mass exodus to Russia: 339  officers have joined the Russian forces. The republic's  Committee for the Social Protection of Servicemen reports that a  further 2,500 officers want to go to Russia. The problem is  made worse by the fact that over half the Belarus men graduating  from Russian military colleges in 1994 have already signed up to  serve in its' Armed Forces. The main reason for this is that a  higher level of social guarantees are enjoyed there.</p>

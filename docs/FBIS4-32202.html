			<p>BFN     [Text] Today, Mr. Victor Surdu, chairman of the Democratic  Agrarian Party of Romania [PDAR], held an extraordinary news  conference during which he presented the letter addressed by  that political party to the members of the Senate and the  Chamber of Deputies, as well as the text of the censure motion  by which the PDAR activates the procedure of withdrawing the  confidence granted to the government.    The principal reason of the censure motion, the document  emphasizes, is based on the current negative state of our  economic and social life, with grave consequences upon the level  of the standard of living.    The motion also mentions the lack of certain concrete  government programs and the critical condition of Romanian  agriculture, which proves the inability of the government to  solve the economic problems and promote its own program.    Commenting on the text of the censure motion, the PDAR  chairman stressed that it represents a gesture to protest  against poverty and incertitude and to condemn incompetence and  inefficiency.    Answering journalists' questions, Surdu expressed the hope  that the censure motion will be seconded by parties with more  weight in parliament, and added that the PUNR [National Romanian  Unity Party] has already expressed its readiness to do so. In  that context, Surdu said that if other parties also want to  initiate censure motions, the PDAR leadership will examine such  initiatives, and if they also include the claims of the PDAR, it  cannot be excluded that the party will support such motions.    Considering that the current structure of parliament does  not  offer any answers to the question toward what kind of society we  are heading, Surdu also said, a reevaluation of the Romanian  political spectrum would be necessary through the organization  of early elections.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] On 31 May, the Industrial Structure Council [ISC],  an advisory organ to the Ministry of International Trade and  Industry [MITI], announced a "1994 Report on Unfair Trade  Practices," in which the council scrutinized the unfair trade  policies and measures of Japan's major trading partners and  regions, including the United States. The report takes up for  the first time the cases of Taiwan and China, which is applying  for GATT membership, enumerating such high tariffs and other  "points whose correction is desired" in order for China to  realize its bid for membership in the near future. Regarding the  United States, the report strongly criticizes such unilateral  measures as the Super 301 section of the Omnibus Trade Law (for  designating and applying sanctions against nations conducting  unfair trade and acts). It seems likely that other countries  will oppose such criticisms, saying that Japan first needs to  reduce its trade surplus. They may also question Japan's stance  to tackle such tasks as expanding imports.    The report was put together by the ISC World Trade  Organization (WTO) Committee's investigation subcommittee for  unfair trade policies and measures (chaired by Seikei  University Law School Professor Mitsuo Matsushita). The report  can be said to be a Japanese version of the "report on foreign  trade barriers" that the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative  (USTR) announced in late March.    The report classifies unfair policies and measures, --  including import volume restrictions, antidumping measures, and  subsidies, which are obstacles to free trade -- into 13 areas.  By using the rules of GATT and the World Trade Organization  (WTO) as a yardstick, the report determines whether policies and  measures of each trade partner are fair.    The report includes comments on the ten major countries and  regions that are Japan's major trading partners, including the  United States, the European Union (EU), the ROK, Hong Kong, and  Australia. In addition, Taiwan and China, which is applying for  GATT membership, are also included in the report. Of the 12  nations and regions, 8 nations and regions are in Asia. Japan's  trade surplus with the Asian nations in fiscal 1993 exceeded for  the first time that with the United States. Reflecting changes  in Japan's trade structure, the report attaches importance to  Asia. However, since it points out Asian nations' problem  points, it is certain that Japan, which has a huge trade  surplus, will be urged to make further efforts to open up its  market.    China, (treating the EU as a single region), is Japan's  third  largest national trading partner. In fiscal 1992, Japanese  investment in China doubled over the previous year's level.  Although China is deepening its economic ties with Japan, the  report clearly spells out China's various trade restriction  measures as obstacles hindering the activities of Japanese  corporations.    Specifically, the report urges China to unify its trade  systems, which vary by region and even by organization. China  is also asked to revise its double price system whereby  foreigners and Chinese are charged different fees for the same  services and to improve its high tariff rates (35 percent on  average) and import and export volume restrictions.    Following China, Taiwan is Japan's fourth largest trading  partner. The report points out that Taiwan has high tariffs on  trucks (42.5 percent) and passenger vehicles (30 percent), and  quantitative restrictions. In particular, Taiwan prohibits  imports of passenger vehicles, motorcycles, fruits, alcoholic  beverages, and cigarettes from Japan. Therefore, the report  urges Taiwan to revise the import bans as quickly as possible.    Moreover, the report names the United States in 10 out of 13  categories of unfair trade practices. It also says that the EU  and the ROK have problems in four and five fields respectively.  Regarding U.S. trade policies, particularly those for setting  numerical targets, the report strongly criticizes the United  States: "They can be said to violate the WTO accord and  constitute `managed trade.'"</p>

			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / UK Company News: NHS contract worries hit Eadie shares Eadie Holdings, the general engineer, lifted pre-tax profits from Pounds 768,353 to Pounds 1.96m over the 1993 year on turnover ahead 27 per cent at Pounds 29.5m. The shares, however, dipped 3p to 37p as the group expressed concern about its contract with the National Health Service. Mr Peter Bromwich, chairman, said most parts of the transport and distribution division performed well. The wheelchairs side had a good year, but uncertainties within the NHS have led to a delay in the placing of the annual contract. Mr Bromwich said there could possibly be a significant reduction in the final level of orders received. Earnings per share rose from 1.33p to 2.55p and the total dividend is lifted from 0.5p to 1p via a final of 0.7p.</p>

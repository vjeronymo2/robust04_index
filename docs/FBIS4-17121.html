			<p>BFN     [Text] The negotiating process between the PLO and Israel  is continuing, though not too fast and not in a direction  favorable to the Palestinians, the PLO leader, Yasir 'Arafat,  told a news conference in Moscow on Wednesday.    According to him, the Palestinians hope that during Prime  Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's visit to Moscow planned for April 24-27  Russia will exert influence on Israel so that it would honor the  agreements reached earlier.    As 'Arafat said, in Moscow he was convinced once again of  Russia's positive attitude to the peace talks in the Middle  East. Evidently for Russia the Middle East is not simply a point  on the map, but a close-lying area, he said.    According to the PLO leader, a Palestinian delegation will  arrive in Russia shortly to conduct negotiations on economic  cooperation. During his "constructive" talks with President  Boris Yeltsin, Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, State Duma  Speaker Ivan Rybkin and Patriarch Aleksiy II he discussed  prospects for cooperation between Russia and Palestine in  different areas, 'Arafat stressed.    In particular he discussed Russian aid in forming a  Palestinian police force. "We did not discuss that issue in  detail, leaving it to technical experts", 'Arafat said.    He highly assessed Russia's call for convening a peace  conference on a settlement in the Middle East -- Madrid-2 --  made last February.    With reference to the stand taken by Israel, 'Arafat said  that Tel Aviv is playing for time. As a result the  Palestinians' attempts to stimulate the talks process were  futile. The commitments stated in the Declaration of Principles  signed by Israel and by the PLO in Washington last September  must not remain unfulfilled. The delays make it possible for  the extremists forces on both sides to consolidate their ranks,  and this might put an end to the peaceful political process,  'Arafat said.    He said he hopes that Rabin's talks in Moscow will  "stimulate" the negotiating process. "We want Rabin to make it  absolutely clear whether he is for peace or not," 'Arafat said.  "The time for words is over, it's time for actions," 'Arafat  concluded.</p>

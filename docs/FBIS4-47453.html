Comparison with data obtained from the three  methods permitted differential evaluation of the effects of the  drugs on learning. Nooglutil and piracetam have no effect on  avoidance learning in a shuttle box or on the T-maze reflex. In  a Skinner box, nooglutil accelerated the formation of the escape  and avoidance responses, while piracetam improved only the  escape response. The reason for enhanced performance in a  Skinner box is that the inherent worsening of performance due to  ambiguous cause and effect relations is countered by the  nootropic drugs. Nootropic drugs have no effect on the formation  of memory pathways in conditions that are not accompanied by  functional disruption of higher nervous activity in both  positive and negative reinforcement.

			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Acid rain target 'being beaten' THE government yesterday said the UK was ahead of its international commitments to reduce acid rain. It said figures on harmful gas emissions showed that last year's output of sulphur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen was below the levels established by the UK plan that implements targets set by the European Community's large combustion plants directive. Total emissions were 2.67m tonnes of sulphur dioxide and 701,645 tonnes of nitrous oxides. Quotas for the year were 3.25m tonnes and 925,000 tonnes respectively. Long-term targets aim for a cut of 60 per cent on 1980 sulphur dioxide levels by the year 2003, and 30 per cent on nitrous oxide levels by 1998. The emissions cover power generating plants, refineries and other industry. The UK received more relaxed emission quotas in the directive than other EC countries because of the large size of its coal-fired power industry, and the expense of cleaning it. Much of last year's reduction was due to a fall in the use of coal-fired power stations. Although two large stations are to add flue gas desulphurisation equipment, the first of these, at Drax in South Yorkshire, will not start until the end of this year. The environmental lobby has criticised the reduction as inadequate, arguing it is driven by regulation and not ecological necessity. Acid rain is said to damage plants, animals and buildings. Tougher standards are being negotiated by industrialised countries, and these are set to be in the directive next year.</p>

			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Government Bonds: UK bond prices retreat on opinion poll rumour UK GOVERNMENT bond prices fell back yesterday with the publication of opinion polls showing the opposition Labour party five percentage points ahead of the Conservatives. Long-dated gilts dropped nearly half a percentage point as rumours circulated that a BBC Newsnight poll would show the Labour party as much as eight points ahead of the ruling Conservatives. In the event, the poll put Labour four points ahead. Traders said the release of better-than-expected retail sales figures yesterday did little to comfort the gilt market. Retail sales rose by 0.4 per cent in February, or 1.5 per cent year-on-year. The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 fell from 113 7/32 to 112 23/32 by late afternoon to yield 9.81 per cent. US TREASURY prices drifted lower yesterday in fairly subdued trading. In late trading, the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was down  3/16 at 99 23/32 , yielding 8.05 per cent. Shorter-dated maturities were also modestly lower. There was some selling following the midday release of the Federal Reserve's Tan book on business conditions in the Fed's 12 districts. Inflationary pressures were downplayed in the report. The Fed said: 'Wage and price pressures appear generally quite moderate.' With no US economic data scheduled for imminent release, the market is expected to turn its attention to next week's two and five-year note auctions. The Treasury has increased the size of the two-year note by Dollars 500m, to Dollars 14.75bn, and similarly increased the five-year auction to Dollars 10.25bn. THE GERMAN government bond market fell on news of a higher-than-expected wage settlement for some of the engineering workers, and speculation that the Bundesbank may raise interest rates at today's Council meeting. The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 88.26 and fell to a low of 87.91 on a volume of 47,000 contracts. News that about 7,000 workers within the IG Metall union had agreed a 7.2 per cent pay rise pushed bund prices down. Traders expressed fears that the agreement could herald further high wage settlements and therefore delay an easing in interest rates. In addition, dealers said the market was unsettled by an announcement that Chancellor Helmut Kohl is due to attend the Bundesbank Council meeting today, with some market participants worried that this could signal an interest rate rise. Elsewhere in the European bond markets, French government debt fell back on worries about the outcome of Sunday's regional elections in France. Foreign investors are concerned that the expected heavy defeat for the ruling Socialists could encourage them to raise state spending ahead of the 1993 general election. JAPANESE government bonds opened on a strong note, helped by the US Treasury bond market's strength overnight and hopes of a cut in interest rates, but drifted back during the day to close slightly lower. The yield on the benchmark No 129 issue moved from its opening level of 5.355 per cent to close at 5.385 per cent in Tokyo. However, the strengthening of the yen against the US dollar to 132.25 in London trading helped to lift JGB prices slightly and the yield on the No 129 moved to 5.37 per cent. The June futures contract fell from its opening of 102.73 to close at 102.66 in Tokyo. Traders continue to speculate that the Bank of Japan will cut the Official Discount Rate in the next few days. However, short-term interest rates edged up yesterday, with three-month certificates of deposit trading at 4.93 per cent.</p>

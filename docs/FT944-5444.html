			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity market tumbles amid inflation worries - Market Report London's equity market remained a slave to events across the Atlantic as well as domestic events and moved a step closer to the 3,000 level on the FT-SE 100 index in the wake of yet more worrying economic news from the US. At the end of another session of low volumes but high anxiety the FT-SE 100 was left nursing a further 22.3 decline at 3,017.3, a two-day decline of 64.1. The latest bout of weakness left the 100 index down 16.2 in a week that included what was perceived by most equity market strategists as a broadly neutral Budget. Second-line stocks were also given a rough ride, with the FT-SE Mid Cap 250 index settling 17.2 off at 3,459.9, down 37.9 over the sessions and 20.4 on the week. It was the release of the latest US data on employment levels that exacerbated an early fall in the London equity market. US non-farm payrolls, which were forecast by London-based economists to come in around 220,000-230,000, actually rose 350,000, which startled London traders who quickly marked prices lower expecting Wall Street to plunge. The sharp increase in job creation in the US manufacturing sector was seen as another inflationary trend in the US, following hard on the heels of a series of disturbing economic trends this week. Earlier in the week it was revealed that US gross domestic product for the third quarter had been revised upwards to show a year-on-year rise of 3.9 per cent, while the consumer confidence index rocketed and the National Purchasing Management index came in well above forecasts. But Wall Street's response to the jobs data confounded the UK market. The US market rose 15 points shortly after the opening only to slip back into negative territory before stabilising in mid-session. Share prices in London wilted at the outset, with market-makers unhappy about recent talk of interest rate rises both here and in the US. Wall Street's overnight 38-points fall, plus the rate rise fears in London, saw share prices marked down sharply and the FT-SE 100 off some 18 points at the opening. Various half-hearted attempts at a rally came to nothing and prices weakened again after the US news. Summing up the day's events, the head of trading at one of the leading broking houses in the City said the market was delicately poised. 'There are stories of a big switch out of equities and into bonds in the US, as well as stories that the US inflation story has been overplayed and the Dow set to rally strongly.' He cautioned, however, that intense volatility is usually a bad sign and that most of the big market-making firms in London were trading off small short books. Others took the view that the market had factored in any bad news regarding inflation and that many of the big funds were now focusing on dividend potential. The regional electricity stocks surged ahead in the morning session as the market alive with stories that either Hanson or Scottish Power were about to bid for Northern Electric. Other recs also made rapid progress as analysts highlighted the prospects of big dividend increases in the sector. On Thursday Seeboard set the benchmark for dividend increases in the sector, announcing a 21 per cent rise in the interim payment. Another story circulating in the market was that Ladbroke was considering the sale of its Texas DIY division to Sainsbury. Turnover in equities totalled a disappointing 447.5m shares, with non-FT-SE stocks accounting for 57 per cent of the day's business. Customer turnover on Thursday jumped to Pounds 1.76bn, the highest level for two weeks. The FT-SE 100's best performance came from Royal Bank of Scotland, after the market re-assessed the 25 per cent dividend increase.</p>

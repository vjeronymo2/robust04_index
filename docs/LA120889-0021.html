			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEWS;  </P> <P> LIFE IN A BLEAK POST-CIVILIZED WORLD  </P> <P> Better Get Your Angel On by Jennifer Allen (Alfred Knopf: $16.95; 112 pages)  </P> <P> If you stripped away everything that makes contemporary life faintly tolerable,  you'd be left with the world according to Allen.  </P> <P> Though she's heralded as a scribe of the "post-verbal" culture, the state she  describes is eerily reminiscent of the prehistoric society so succinctly  defined by Thomas Hobbes: "No arts, no letters, no society, and which is worst  of all, continual fear and danger of violent death; and the life of man,  solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short."  </P> <P> There's one depressingly crucial difference. The bleak conditions Hobbes  described eventually improved, but once you're "post-civilized," there's  nowhere to go but down and out. Though Allen, as a "post-verbal" writer, is not  geographically as specific as she might be, a close reader can easily deduce  that most of these horrific tales are set in California. We're already here, in  the eye of the apocalypse.  </P> <P> All vestiges of love, law and morality are gone, replaced by hatred, violence  and mindless lust. Taking this unpromising detritus, the author succeeds in  giving us a vision of the immediate future, one so unnervingly close to present  reality that the old reliable tranquilizer -- "It's only a story" -- doesn't  work.  </P> <P> For one thing, these aren't stories in the ordinary sense, but mere moments in  time and space -- structureless and all but characterless, though the  environment is all too familiar -- the beach, a motel, the freeway, a housing  project. Allen creates her fiction out of found incidents much the way the  Dadaists made art from found objects, but while they were only teasing the  public, Allen is warning us that this is the way life is going to be from now  on.  </P> <P> Because her actors have all but lost the knack of intelligible speech, the  direction is not immediately apparent. Even so, you get the drift, or perhaps  undertow is the better word.  </P> <P> In a grimly sardonic piece called "Dinner," a monstrous family of three boys, a  mother and father are having a meal. The father wants everyone to say grace,  which in this context is as unimaginable as expecting a hyena to mind a baby.  One son sucks the blood off the strings tying the roast, another drinks blood,  a third breaks the furniture. The father hits the kids, curses, and threatens,  while the mother endures, saying at the end, "Grace is over," not only the  understatement of the decade but a concise summary of the content of the whole  book.  </P> <P> In "Her Name Is Wahoo," the title character is a dog and the narrator "a hoser  of pens at the pet kennel." Man and dog live in a subdivision so raw that  coyotes steal infants. Instead of names, the residents are known by the  position of their houses -- "the first house on the left." If you've been  looking for an effective dehumanization metaphor, your search is over.  </P> <P> Tough customers can proceed to "Chlorine," in which one character has a  crucifix stuck in his nose and other is called Skate-Rat Lance. The whole gang  is "spaced out to the max," enjoying a small-scale race war on the cement-sided  river bank where they roller-skate. What Allen's publisher calls "a linguistic  evolution in the very first stages of staking its historical claim" is not only  evident here, but already in full flower.  </P> <P> These are all worst-case scenarios, written to be perceived rather than  described. We're dealing here with hyper-reality, and it's not for the  squeamish. Endowed with perfect pitch for the speech of her humanoids,  exploiting a macabre and antic imagination, Allen's 13 projections not only  explore the depths of modern life but wallow in them. You join the fun at your  peril.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 4 (KCNA) -- The long-distance  pipeline for the transport of headings is greatly contributing  to keeping iron and steel production on a high level at the Kim  Chaek Iron and Steel Complex.    The pipeline, with an annual transport capacity of 2 million  tons, has carried tens of millions of tons of headings after its  commissioning.    Laid in 1975, it stretches 98 kilometres from the Musan iron  ore mine, North Hamgyong Province, in the northernmost region of  Korea, to the Kim Chaek Iron and Steel Complex, a metallurgical  giant in Chongjin.    By carrying a large portion of iron headings to the complex,  the pipeline lessens the burden of rails and motors.    Technicians and workers have laid double lines in the  steepest 8 km-long section across the Kumpae ridge and improved  the equipment for a higher rate of operation.    The great leader President Kim Il-song initiated the laying  of this pipeline to fully solve the problem of iron heading  transport in keeping with the increasing production capacity at  the Musan mining complex and the Kim Chaek Iron and Steel  Complex, and wisely led the work.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il took all necessary  measures such as the supply of equipment and building machines  so that the construction of the long-distance pipeline for the  transport of headings could be finished in a short time.    And he sent many latest equipment and facilities after the  construction of the transport pipeline so that it could fully  display its potential.</p>

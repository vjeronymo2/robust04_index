			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Business confidence will recover soon, say LBS forecasters BUSINESS confidence will recover significantly in the next few months, and output soon after, according to a study published today by the Centre for Economic Forecasting at the London Business School. Consumer confidence in the UK has recovered markedly since the end of the Gulf war, the researchers say. Yet producer confidence remains stuck at the low levels it sank to last autumn, in spite of the end of the war and the return of oil prices to pre-war levels. Business confidence should have returned to its pre-war trend by now, the researchers say. Using statistical techniques that purport to estimate the trend, they argue that businesses in the UK remain unduly pessimistic. The latest Confederation of British Industry quarterly industrial trends survey, to be published tomorrow, should show a recovery in business confidence, according to the LBS research. The LBS estimates that the percentage of respondents expecting output to fall over the next four months should exceed those expecting it to rise by only 15 percentage points, compared with 24 percentage points in the March monthly survey. Leaked results from the CBI April survey suggest less of a recovery in business confidence. The percentage-point difference between those businesses expecting output to fall rather than rise has fallen to a balance of just eight, according to a report in The Independent on Sunday.

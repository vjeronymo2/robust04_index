			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (iii) A special claims processing office provided for a disaster or civil disturbance should include a claims approving authority with adequate investigatory, administrative, and logistical support, to include damage assessment and finance and accounting support. It should not be dispatched prior to notification of Commander, USARCS. The concurrence of Commander, USARCS must be obtained prior to the payment of the first claim. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Claims processing offices discussed in paragraphs (c)(2) through (4) of this section must be supervised by an assigned JA or claims attorney in order to exercise delegated approval authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Claims policies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) General. (1) Claims investigation and adjudication should be accomplished at the lowest level possible, that is, by the claims processing office or area claims office with monetary authority over the estimated total value of all claims arising from the incident in question. The expeditious investigation and settlement of claims is essential to the successful fulfillment of the Army's responsibilities under the claims statutes implemented by this part. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Where technical errors exist in the filing of a claim or in its format, claimants should be advised of such errors and the need for corrective action. If the errors concern a jurisdictional matter, advice should be given expeditiously and a record should be maintained. The advice should include a warning that the error must be corrected prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Investigative environment. In the investigation of claims, every effort should be made to create a cooperative environment engendering the free exchange of information and evidence. The goal of obtaining sufficient information to make an objective and fair analysis should be paramount. Personal contact with claimants or their representatives is frequently essential to clarify the issues both during investigation and prior to adjudication. Where settlement is not feasible, issues of disagreement or dispute should be clearly identified and spelled out to facilitate the resolution of any reconsideration, appeal, or in appropriate cases, litigation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Claims directives and plans. (1) Two copies of command claims directives will be furnished to the Commander, USARCS. Area claims office directives will be distributed to all DA and DOD commands, installations, and activities within the area of responsibility with an information copy to Commander, USARCS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) One copy of all area claims offices' disaster/civil disturbance plan or annex will be furnished to the Commander, USARCS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Interpretations. The Commander, USARCS will publish written interpretations of the provisions of this part and establish and publish policy as to those matters that are within agency discretion. Interpretations and policies that reference this provision will have the same force and effect as this part. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Exceptions. If it is considered to be in the best interest of the Government, the Commander, USARCS may grant authority to deviate from the specific requirements contained in this part in a particular instance except as to matters that are based on statutes, treaties and international agreements, executive orders, controlling directives of the Attorney General or Comptroller General, or otherwise have the force and effect of law. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Guidance. The Commander, USARCS may publish bulletins, manuals, handbooks, notes, and a DA Pamphlet to provide claims authorities with guidance on administrative and procedural matters related to the implementation of this part. These will be binding on all Army claims personnel. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) Communication. All claims personnel are authorized to communicate directly with personnel of the USARCS for guidance on matters of policy or relating to the implementation of this part. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) Private relief bills. There is no established procedure under which DA sponsors private relief legislation; this is a matter between an individual and his or her congressman. Claims personnel will remain neutral in private relief matters. No statement should be made that purports to reflect a DA position on a private relief bill. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Guidance concerning disclosure of information and assistance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Conflict of interest. Government personnel are forbidden to represent any claimant or to receive any payment or gratuity for services rendered. They may not accept any share or interest in a claim or assist in its presentation, under penalty of Federal criminal law (18 U.S.C. 203, and 205). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Release of information. (1) Government personnel are prohibited from disclosing information that may be the basis of a claim or any evidence of record in any claims matter except as authorized by statutory or regulatory authority. Certain documents which would normally be privileged or exempt from release, such as unclassified statements, documents containing opinions, conclusions, or findings, may be released to a claimant or his or her attorney, wherever release may help settle a claim or avoid unnecessary litigation, unless such release is barred by statute. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) All requests for records and information made pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) or the Privacy Act (PA) will be processed in accordance with the procedures set forth in AR 25&hyph;55 or AR 340&hyph;21. Requests submitted by a claimant or his or her attorney, which cite only the FOIA, will be processed under the time limits of the FOIA and the exceptions and fees of the PA and FOIA, as required by AR 25&hyph;55, paragraph 1&hyph;512c. Except for medical quality assurance records exempt from disclosure by 10 U.S.C. records protected by the Privacy Act of 1974, records within a category for which withholding of the record is discretionary (AR 25&hyph;55, paragraph 3&hyph;101) may be released to a claimant or his or her attorney, if no legitimate purpose exists for withholding it.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) When it is determined that exempt information should not be released, the request will be forwarded to USARCS. For requests processed only under the FOIA, the commander, USARCS, may deny release of the records, acting on behalf of TJAG, the initial denial authority. The commander, USARCS will forward to TJAG all requests processed under the FOIA and PA. TJAG is the initial denial authority for PA requests (AR 340&hyph;21, paragraph 1&hyph;7i). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Claims assistance. The foregoing prohibitions do not apply to information and assistance provided in the performance of official duty. Any person who indicates a desire to file a claim against the United States cognizable under one of the subparts of this part will be instructed concerning the procedure to follow. The claimant will be furnished claim forms and, when necessary, will be assisted in completing claim forms and assembling evidence. He or she will not be assisted in determining what amount to claim. In the vicinity of a field exercise, maneuver, or disaster, information may be disseminated concerning the right to present claims, the procedure to be followed, and the names and location of claims officers and engineer repair teams. When the government of a foreign country in which U.S. Armed Forces are stationed has assumed responsibility for the settlement of certain claims against the United States, officials of that country will be furnished pertinent information and evidence so far as security considerations permit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Single-service claims responsibility (DODD 5515.8). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Statutes and agreements.

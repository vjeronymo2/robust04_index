			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Standard Chartered Yesterday's interim results from Standard Chartered will come as something of a shock to investors who have grown used to thinking of it as a high-growth, high-risk stock. Standard has been making commendable efforts to reduce risk in its balance sheet, but the cost appears to have been considerable in terms of growth. Operating profit in Hong Kong actually fell. Across the Asian region as a whole, operating return on gross assets fell by 10 basis points. The market will need time to be convinced that risks have been reduced, especially while the  - admittedly non-financial - echoes of Mocatta and the Hong Kong authorities' censure continue to reverberate. The danger meanwhile is that Standard will appear a high-risk low-growth enterprise. Hence yesterday's 6 per cent fall in its share price. Standard itself has a number of explanations for its Hong Kong result. Dealing profits were down; the bank was bidding up for deposits to secure funding beyond 1997; it was pulling back from riskier types of lending, for example in property. If one strips out merchant banking activities, operating profits in the territory were strongly ahead. The trouble is that none of this is quantified. The suspicion that banking margins are coming under pressure in Hong Kong also took its toll on HSBC yesterday. Given its strong retail franchise in Asia's newly affluent markets, Standard's longer-term growth prospects ought to be good. Its strategy will be more convincing, however, if it can quickly show an ability to generate income growth from the more secure base which it claims to have created. It cannot rely much longer on falling bad debt provisions to boost earnings growth.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Claudia Siria; from the "National Newscast;" </F> passages within quotation marks are recorded]    [Text] Adolfo Jarquin Ortel, director of the Social  Democratic Party [PSD], summoned the party's rank and file  membership to elect new authorities, something that reflects the  serious infighting within that organization. He warned that he  will sue party President Guillermo Potoy for slander. Crises  within the seven parties [of the National Opposition Union, UNO]  worsened when National Conservative Party [PNC] member Edmundo  Castillo decided to back the constitutional reforms. Tomorrow  the party's directorate meets to change officers.    [Jarquin, in progress] "...we believe the time has come for  us to take the party's leadership and not play into the hands of  those who have personal interests at stake."    Adolfo Jarquin Ortel, who along with other UNO deputies will  join the National Assembly on 10 January, was accused by the PSD  president of having been bribed [canoneado] with thousands of  dollars.    [Potoy] "Corruption has raised doubts about PSD operations."    [Jarquin] "I am considering taking legal action against  Potoy."    Meanwhile, Alfredo Cesar said that those who favor a  constituent assembly really seek to move elections ahead to next  year.    [Cesar] "The moment the constituent assembly is elected [as  heard] it will decide to leave or remove governments."    [Jarquin] "We disagree with them. This has been their idea.  Everyone in this country knows that we voted for a president  like Dona Violeta for her to complete her term through 1996.  The international community supports Dona Violeta completing  her Constitutional term...."    Jarquin accused Liberals and Conservatives of competing for  a  power take over through an early campaign. Meanwhile, the seven  parties that favor a constituent assembly said they have funds  to call for elections that would cost the country about $30  million.    [Deputy Frank Duarte, secretary of the National Assembly]  "Engineer Cesar no doubt continues to deceive the Nicaraguan  people by making them believe there is a fund to finance those  elections. In the best of cases it would be financed by the  National Assembly and we have heard nothing of the sort."    The crises also affected the PNC because Edmundo Castillo  rebelled against the Constituent Assembly and said he will join  the National Assembly. Dr. Castillo accused the UNO Political  Council of being two-faced and acting with a double standard.    [Castillo] "Enough said about being two-faced and having  double standards. We need to be at the assembly, we must defend  the peoples' interests."    [Siria] "At one time your group also charged that the Center  Group had been bribed. What will happen now that you also are  accused of receiving bribes, will you also sue?"    [Castillo] "I believe that if someone dares to say this I  will file criminal charges. Not only will I file criminal  charges but I will respond like a man...."</p>

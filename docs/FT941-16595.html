			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Books: A look back at affairs VIVE MOI] AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY by Sean O'Faolain Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 20, 377 pages When the late Sean O'Faolain was in his eighties, his daughter Julia encouraged him to write a supplement to his 1964 autobiography. In deference to his wife, Eileen, the earlier volume had not mentioned three important affairs of his middle age - with Elizabeth Bowen, Honor Tracy and an American socialite, Kick Erlanger. By then he was finding writing increasingly difficult, and this was the only subject that appealed to him, as Julia O'Faolain explains in her introductory 'Afterword' (sic). The original Vive Moi] contained an interesting and selective record of a writer's development. He was born in Cork in 1900, the son of a policeman and a woman who took in theatrical lodgers, grew up during the Gaelic Revival, the Easter Rising and the Civil War and then won a scholarship to Harvard. By the time his first collection of stories was published in 1932 the best of the autobiography is over. When not discussing writing, O'Faolain falls into a flat anecdotal tone. He is good at specific descriptions but cannot handle abstract ideas. O'Faolain first met Elizabeth Bowen some time before the 1939 war (the date is not clear). He read The Last September on his way to London and arrived in a state of great excitement about this 'Irish Turgenev'. An acquaintance organised a lunch to introduce the stately Anglo-Irish woman to the disillusioned patriot who had fought for the new Republic only to have it ban his books as obscene. She was only a year older than he, but they were worlds apart. The trouble with O'Faolain's account of this unlikely alliance is that we learn very little about Elizabeth Bowen as a person, although he does eventually insinuate that Elizabeth the writer was not quite Irish enough for his tastes. More revealing is Julia's memory of 'La Bowen' as a source of contention between Sean and Eileen because she invited Sean but not Eileen to house parties. Julia also points out that O'Faolain's supposedly candid memoir does not mention Eileen's 'stress-maladies . . . brought on by your philandering with Honor Tracy'. Much is made by the ungallant O'Faolain of Honor Tracy's plainness: a buxom red-head with no ankles who, nevertheless, was known to the pub-gossips within months of arriving in Dublin after the war as 'Hot Pants Tracy'. When eventually she seduces O'Faolain he is overwhelmed by her sexual expertise and he seems to have remained in her thrall for several years. We learn from the Afterword that when the affair was over she rented a small tower in the same village as O'Faolain and his family, and lived there defiantly for years, which says more about her spirit and her sense of humour than O'Faolain does. Julia O'Faolain's affection for her father and her understanding of him are evident in her Afterword which is drafted (rather archly) as an intimate letter to 'dear Sean'. But her judgment in publishing the often portentous ramblings of his old age be questioned. She has apparently edited his 'candid supplement', but not with any great care. To misquote Yeats once is bad enough, but to misquote him twice and follow that with a misquotation from one of Shakespeare's best known sonnets is inexcusable. Neither is any effort made to tidy up the chronology. Worst of all, we do not really learn anything of interest about two of the more important friendships in his life  -with Elizabeth Bowen and Honor Tracy - except for the fact that these friendships also had a sexual side.</p>

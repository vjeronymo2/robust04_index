			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Letter: Vehicles not so polluting Sir, Your report 'Roads bring growing tensions to Whitehall' (August 6) contains a seriously misleading statement about 'traffic fumes'. These were to be the fastest growing factor in air pollution. The fact is that noxious vehicle emissions are now declining because of the introduction of catalytic converters. This is recognised by the Department of the Environment which, in its recently issued consultation paper on 'sustainable development', stated that tighter emission standards introduced in 1993 for new vehicles, together with tighter checks on older ones, should lead to a steady improvement in air quality to the end of the century and beyond.

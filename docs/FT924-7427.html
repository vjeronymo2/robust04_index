			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Supreme Court to hear tobacco pricing case THE US Supreme Court yesterday agreed to hear a tobacco competition case which involves claims by the Brooke Group - formerly Liggett Group - that Brown &amp; Williamson, a subsidiary of Britain's BAT Industries, used predatory pricing to limit Brooke's ability to compete, writes Nikki Tait in New York. The case could also clarify the extent to which price-cutting is legal. Brooke/Liggett introduced low-price generic cigarettes in the early-1980s, to which Brown &amp; Williamson responded with a brand of its own and offers of volume-based rebates. Brooke brought an anti-trust case against B&amp;W and in 1990 was awarded nearly Dollars 50m (Pounds 33.1m) - increased to Dollars 148.8m because of the anti-trust nature of the case. However, a federal appeals court subsequently ruled in B&amp;W's favour.</p>

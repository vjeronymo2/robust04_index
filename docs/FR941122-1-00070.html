			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The petitioned species are characterized by a substantial lack of information regarding their geographical range, ecological requirements, and population status. The Natural Diversity Data Base of the California Department of Fish and Game had no records of any of these animals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The petition stated that the Jacalitos Jerusalem cricket is known from Jacalitos Canyon and the Panoche Hills in Fresno County, and Kettleman Hills in Kings County. Tinkham and Rentz (1969) reported records from two localities in Tulare County and three localities in western Fresno County. The Jacalitos Jerusalem cricket is restricted to areas containing sandstone and is found primarily under rocks at the bases of hillsides (Tinkham and Rentz 1969). No data are available on the specific localities or status of the Jacalitos Jerusalem cricket. The petitioner stated that the Jacalitos shield-backed katydid is known from two male specimens. No information was presented on the specific localities, habitat requirements, or status of the Jacalitos shield-backed katydid. Oil drilling and livestock grazing were cited as threats to these two animals. Jacalitos Canyon is included as a conservation area in the Coalinga Habitat Conservation Plan (Ron Rempel, California Department of Fish and Game, pers. comm. 1993). No urban development is proposed or likely in this area because of a lack of water. Indirect protection for the Jacalitos Jerusalem cricket and the Jacalitos shield-backed katydid may be provided by the presence of the endangered San Joaquin kit fox ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Vulpes macrotis mutica <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) and blunt-nosed leopard lizard ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Gambelia silus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) in the area. Beyond the information described above, the petitioner presented few data on the status of the animal. Therefore, the Service determines that the petitioner did not present substantial information that the requested action may be warranted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The splendid shield-backed katydid is only known from two localities, Barstow and 3 miles west of Essex, San Bernardino County, California. This species has been found in creosote bushes (Rentz and Birchim 1968). The petitioner stated that a female specimen reported from the Imperial Valley in Imperial County, California, is apparently a different species. No information was presented to the Service on the specific localities, habitat requirements, or population status of this animal. No threats to this species were cited in the petition or are otherwise known to the Service. Beyond the information described above, the petition presented few data on the status of the animal. Therefore, the Service determines that the petitioner did not present substantial information that the requested action may be warranted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> November 28, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SUMMIT HEALTH HIRES PRESIDENT TO NURSE FIRM BACK TO LIFE  </P> <P> Summit Health Ltd., which operates 21 hospitals and 21 nursing homes and  retirement centers, is seriously ill itself. The 12-year-old company lost $15  million in the past two years, piled up a mountain of debt and watched its  stock plunge to $1.50 a share from $14 in 1985.  </P> <P> What's the solution? Summit founder and Chairman Don Freeberg, and the rest of  Summit's board, think that they found part of the answer last month in a  37-year-old numbers whiz named Donald J. Amaral, who was hired as president and  chief operating officer after a yearlong search.  </P> <P> Shedding assets also is part of the plan. Last month, Burbank-based Summit said  its bankers urged the company to weigh the sale of its nursing-home division,  which accounted for 15% of Summit's $376 million revenues for the fiscal year  that ended June 30.  </P> <P> That division already had been pared by the divestiture of 31 nursing homes  over the past three years, according to Summit's fiscal 1989 annual report.  During the same period, Summit sold one hospital and closed two others to cut  its debt load and improve profitability.  </P> <P> But whatever other strategies Freeberg and Amaral have in store for Summit,  they're not sharing them publicly. Both declined to be interviewed, as did Vice  Chairman John E. Anderson.  </P> <P> Regardless, one thing is for sure: Freeberg, Anderson and the other directors  have more riding on the company's turnaround than just fiduciary duty to the  public stockholders. Lots of their own money also is at stake.  </P> <P> According to Summit's latest proxy statement, issued Oct. 18, Freeberg, through  his 93%-owned Sierra Land Group Inc., and his two sons control 56% of Summit's  stock, worth about $26.4 million. But the value of their stake has plunged 71%  since early 1988, when Summit's stock traded for $5.25 a share in the  over-the-counter market. Summit's directors and officers as a group own 66% of  the company.  </P> <P> Summit began looking for a new president a year ago, after William L.  Pierpoint, who had held the post since 1977, resigned. Summit gave no  explanation for his departure. But a money manager who owns Summit stock and  who asked not to be identified said that with the company sagging under  Pierpoint's leadership, "they mutually agreed that he should go."  </P> <P> Pierpoint remains a director and still owns 11% of the stock, according to the  proxy statement. Freeberg assumed the president's post during the search for  Pierpoint's successor.  </P> <P> Amaral, who has a master's degree in business administration from UCLA, came to  Summit from Mediplex Group Inc., a health-care unit of Avon Products. Amaral  was president and chief executive of Mediplex, based in Wellesley, Mass., and  had plans to expand Mediplex with Avon's backing. But in 1988, Avon decided to  largely abandon the health-care field and began divesting Mediplex's assets, so  Amaral quit.  </P> <P> Amaral "left because the mission that brought him here and attracted him, in  terms of expansion, was gone," said William J. Hartigan, who succeeded Amaral  as Mediplex's president.  </P> <P> Amaral had spent 10 years working in various financial posts for the hospital  group of National Medical Enterprises, a Los Angeles-based health-care concern.  </P> <P> Hartigan said Amaral has the credentials to help Summit, whose local facilities  include the Woodland Care Center in Reseda, Midway Hospital Medical Center in  Los Angeles and St. Luke Medical Center in Pasadena. The company employs about  4,600 people.  </P> <P> "He's very bright, with very good management ability," Hartigan said. "He's an  exceptional talent around numbers. He could do them in his head faster than I  could do them with my calculator."  </P> <P> Summit's numbers certainly present Amaral with a challenge. In fiscal 1989,  Summit lost $8.4 million, and its long-term debt as of June 30 of $137 million  -- although down 4% from a year earlier -- remained nearly twice as large as  Summit's equity, or net worth. By contrast, the net worth of Humana Inc., one  of the biggest health-care concerns, is about equal to its long-term debt.  </P> <P> Summit's fiscal 1989 loss stemmed in part from a $15.5-million provision for  the company's losses on the sale or closure of assets during the year, which  included the closing of a loss-ridden hospital in Colorado Springs, Colo.  Excluding the provision, Summit's pretax income from operations tumbled 82% to  $1.2 million, from $6.8 million the previous year.  </P> <P> In an effort to further cut its debt, Summit last January also suspended its  semiannual dividend of 2 cents per share. And Summit can't pay future dividends  without approval from its bank lenders.  </P> <P> Summit's problems grew serious in the mid-1980s, after the company aggressively  raised cash for acquisitions, including an initial public offering of stock  (priced at $7 a share), bank borrowings and its issuance of $86.3 million of  high-yield "junk bonds"  </P> <P> (of which $49 million remained due as of June 30).  </P> <P> Just as Summit was gearing up to expand, financial trends in the health-care  field began undergoing major changes that subsequently put pressure on the  industry's profits. Specifically, Medicare, the federal health insurer for the  elderly that accounts for up to half of some hospitals' revenue, began to clamp  down on its costs in 1983.  </P> <P> Medicare once reimbursed hospitals with a fee based on each service given to a  Medicare patient. But to encourage hospitals and doctors to cut costs, the  government switched to a system of paying a flat fee based only on the  patient's ailment.  </P> <P> This new system often forces hospitals to perform fewer tests and discharge  patients sooner to earn a profit on each patient. But the shorter visits,  together with the growth of health maintenance organizations (HMOs), have  reduced hospitals' overall occupancy rates.  </P> <P> Summit's U. S. hospitals "have been experiencing declining occupancy levels and  average lengths of hospital stays for the past few years," the company stated.  The average occupancy rate, for example, fell to 42% in fiscal 1989 from 48% in  fiscal 1986, Summit said.  </P> <P> As a result, "reimbursement from Medicare and other governmental programs have  lagged behind increases in labor and other costs" at Summit, the company stated  in its fiscal 1989 10-K, an annual financial report that publicly held  companies must file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  </P> <P> Even outside the United States and the Medicare regulations, Summit is  struggling. The company has a 60% stake in Orbit Summit Health, a partnership  that manages several hospitals in Saudi Arabia. But Summit has decided that the  business -- which kicked in $20.2 million of Summit's fiscal 1989 revenue -- is  not worth the cost and is trying to sell its interest in the partnership.  </P> <P> Amaral has some room in which to work. As of June 30, Summit's current assets  -- its cash on hand plus money the company expects to receive within a year --  totaled $119 million. That was nearly twice as much as Summit's current  liabilities, or bills due within the year, including the payments on its  long-term debt of $69.3 million.  </P> <P> Amaral could get a bigger cushion if Summit continues shedding properties and  uses the cash to reduce its debts. Even so, he will remain under pressure to  control Summit's costs if the company is to turn steady profits over the long  haul because the government's efforts to curb health-care expenses are unlikely  to abate anytime soon.  </P></p>

			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Indonesian whispers turn to shouts: A report on the Jakarta opposition's efforts to unravel the latest alleged banking scandal Members of Indonesian opposition parties are stepping up efforts to bring details of an alleged banking scandal into the open. The attorney-general's office in Jakarta is investigating the bad debts of PT Kanindo Prima Perkasa textile company, owned and operated by Mr Robby Tjahjadi, a controversial businessman jailed in the 1970s for smuggling. Mr Tjahjadi is alleged to have defaulted on about Rp 500bn of debts (Pounds 149m) at two state-owned banks, Bank Bumi Daya and Bank Pembangunan Indonesia, more commonly referred to as Bapindo. His company, Kanindo, is said to be suffering from serious liquidity problems. The Bapindo bank is also at the centre of another scandal involving Mr Eddy Tansil, owner of the Golden Key Group, recently sentenced to 17 years' imprisonment for defrauding the bank of more than Dollars 450m. The case exposed the extent to which lenders collude illegally with borrowers to secure loans, bringing out in the open the level of bad debts at state banks. The Tansil case 'is an appalling reality' that suggest the Indonesian banking industry is an instrument for activities of legalised crime,' said Mr Laksamana Sukardi, an economic consultant and prominent member of the opposition party PDI, said. No one has been arrested or brought to trial yet in the Kanindo case, but many Indonesians are demanding that someone be held responsible. Mr Tjahjadi is thought to be in Singapore. Adding a twist to the Kanindo case are allegations that the textile company managed to secure additional loans from Bapindo as recently as April by issuing fake export documents to support its loan application. If this is true, the company would have secured a loan from Bapindo while a number of Bapindo executives were standing trial for their involvement in the Golden Key loan case which shook the banking establishment in Indonesia. In an effort to resolve Kanindo's bad debts problems, Mr M Muhammad, Indonesia's finance minister, has appointed the Federation of Indonesian Batik Co-operatives to take over the management of the company. The government is also courting the textile group Texmaco to take over Kanindo's assets. Details of the Kanindo case were made public late last year but the government did not take any action at the time. Mr Tjahjadi was summoned to appear in a parliamentary hearing but members who questioned him about the state of his loans could not back up their allegations because of banking secrecy laws. Since then, opposition parties have increased pressure on the government to take action against Mr Tjahjadi. The Kanindo affair is raising questions about the government's efforts to clean up the banking sector. The scandal involving the Golden Key group prompted Mr Muhammad to expose the extent of bad loans at state banks, an effort praised by private commercial banks. Mr Muhammad announced earlier this year that 21.2 per cent, or about Dollars 7bn, of the outstanding loans extended by the state banks were classified as bad or doubtful, compared with 17.4 per cent at the end of 1992 and 16 per cent in 1990. Economists and bankers in Jakarta say the figure could be much higher. Since then, Indonesia's central bank, Bank Indonesia, has been conducting investigations into state banks with problem loans, singling out companies that have caused the problems. Mr Sudradjad Djiwandono, governor of the central bank, said a supervisory team had been formed with the Ministry of Finance. 'We've asked banks to identify the clients creating problems for them and we're dealing with them one by one,' the governor said. Now Indonesians are demanding to know how the central bank could have overlooked Kanindo's bad debts. 'The Kanindo case is causing us major apprehension,' said an editorial in the English-language daily, the Jakarta Post.</p>

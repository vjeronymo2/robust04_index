The State Council Information Office held a news conference  for Chinese and foreign reporters in Beijing today. During the  news conference, Ye Qing, vice minister of the State Planning  Commission, briefed the reporters on these two documents and  answered their questions.    Ye Qing said: The "Outlines of the State's Industrial Policy  for the Nineties" and the "Policy for the Automobile Industry,"  which serves as one of the special industrial policies in the  outlines, are important measures to adapt to the new situation  of China's socialist market economy; strengthen and improve  macroeconomic control; readjust and maximize industrial  structure; and promote a sustained, rapid, and sound development  of national economy.    Ye Qing said: In light of the objective rules of  industrialization and modernization as well as national  realities and structural changes in China, the outlines forward  major subjects needed to be solved when China readjusts and  maximizes its industrial structure in the nineties. The  subjects are: First, it is necessary to continue to strengthen  the farming sector's status as the foundation of the national  economy and comprehensively develop the rural economy. Second,  great efforts should be made to build basic industries and  improve a situation in which basic industries and  infrastructural facilities are backward. Third, it is necessary  to accelerate the growth of pillar industries so as to  invigorate the national economy. Fourth, it is imperative to  reasonably readjust foreign trade system and strengthen the  ability of China's industrial sectors in international  competition. Meanwhile, massive efforts should be made to  develop the tertiary industry and accelerate the development of  high and new technological industry. It is necessary to maximize  the industrial structure and promote industrial and technical  standards so as to have an even better industrial distribution.    The "Policy for the Automobile Industry," which was  promulgated at the same time as the outlines, clearly defines  China's goal for the development of the automobile industry;  policies for industrial organization, industrial technology, and  industrial distribution; as well as policies concerning foreign  funds and foreign trade. This special industrial policy has  been put into force.    In accordance with the outlines' requirements, the State  Council will also continue to examine and approve special  industrial policies for transportation, telecommunications,  construction, electronic, machine-building, and petrochemical  industries; and policies related to foreign funds, foreign  trade, technology, and readjustment of industrial organization.    Ye Qing said: The "Outlines of the State's Industrial Policy  for the Nineties" also clearly stipulate the procedures for  formulating industrial policies and their implementing measures.  The outlines stipulate the following rules: (1) The State  Council will decide the state's industrial policies. State  Planning Commission will be responsible for the overall work of  studying, formulating, and coordinating the state's industrial  policies. The State Planning Commission will initiate, with  help from departments concerned, the work of formulating various  industrial policies. (2) It is necessary to set up a reviewing  system for the state's industrial policies. (3) It is necessary  to set up a system that serves to guarantee the implementation  of the state's industrial policies. (4) It is necessary to set  up a system for the supervision, inspection, and appraisal of  the state's industrial policies. (5) People's governments at  provincial level should study and formulate, in accordance with  the requirements of the outlines and local realities, specific  rules for the implementation of these outlines and submit them  to the State Planning Commission for the record.    The outlines also put forewords "Some Regulations Concerning  the Standards of Economic Scale for Fixed Asset Investment  Projects (First Group)," which clearly stipulate the standards  of economic scale for a group of fixed asset investment projects.</p>

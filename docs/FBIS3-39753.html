When it was known that NATO's decision was not  to attack at present because the Serbs were meeting the  conditions of the ultimatum, Foreign Minister Javier Solana  expressed the government's wish for the terms of this ultimatum  to be applied and extended to the other cities of Bosnia. Valle  Alonso:    [Alonso] In statements to Radio Nacional early this morning  Foreign Minister Javier Solana ruled out air strikes in  Sarajevo. Solana made these statements at the Moncloa [Palace],  where he, the prime minister, the deputy prime minister, the  defense minister, and the minister of the prime minister's  office had been since 1900. Javier Solana, who was in constant  telephone contact with his counterparts from the European Union  and Spanish diplomats and Spanish military commanders in the  former Yugoslavia, said that the NATO operation remains open and  the Spanish contingent is well.    [Begin Solana recording] The whole operation remains open  and  remains ready to be put into effect if necessary. What I can  tell you is, I stress again, that the situation on the ground is  developing favorably, positively. The deadlines of the  conditions of the ultimatum are being met. And I will emphasize  once again that our forces and the Spaniards on the ground are  well. [end recording]    [Alonso] Solana indicated that the Western European Union  [as  heard] is in favor of the initiative started in Sarajevo being  extended to other besieged enclaves such as Mostar. According  to the foreign minister, this stance is supported in full by the  Spanish government.    [Begin Solana recording] It is the wish of the Spanish  government, in collaboration with the European Union, to try to  use this initiative which has been started to liberate Sarajevo  to give a new impetus to the peace negotiations, which should  spread to the whole territory of Yugoslavia. I can tell you  that some initiatives are already underway. Yesterday and today  we, many of the European ministers, were in touch with our  Russian, Canadian and U.S. counterparts to try to put forward a  new peace initiative as soon as possible. [end recording]    [Alonso] The foreign minister emphasized that yesterday the  government kept in touch with the different parliamentary groups  so that they could have the most detailed possible information  on the latest developments.</p>

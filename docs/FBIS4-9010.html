			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, April 15 (BTA) -- The official visit here of  German Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel ended  this afternoon.    At a press conference before his departure for Hungary Mr.  Klaus Kinkel said his talks in Sofia were fruitful and focused  mainly on bilateral relations, Bulgaria's striving to  integration with the European structures and the situation in  the former Yugoslavia. This morning Mr. Kinkel had talks with  Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov and was received  by President Zhelyu Zhelev, National Assembly Chairman  Aleksandur Yordanov and acting Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev.  Mr. Kinkel invited the Bulgarian foreign minister to visit  Germany. "Mr. Kinkel's visit has inspired us with fresh hope in  our striving to integration with the European structures and  with courage to push with the economic reform", said Bulgarian  Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov.    "Germany wishes to help Bulgaria on its difficult road of  reform", German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said. He  specified, however, that this may be help for self help. Mr.  Kinkel said the same in Albania. "As a friend I would like to  advise Bulgaria to make itself more attractive". Mr. Kinkel  said. He added that Germany would continue its support for  Bulgaria, as well as for the Central European states, especially  after June 1, when it will take over the presidency of the  European Union. Bulgaria may count on Germany's support in its  striving to integration with the European Union, GATT, NATO and  the organization to succeed the Cocom [Coordination Committee  For Multilateral Export Controls], as well as in the  establishment of relations of association with the Western  European Union.    Mr. Kinkel discussed in Sofia the situation in the former  Yugoslavia and in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia -- FYROM] and Kosovo in particular. "It is necessary  for Serbian suppression measures to cease there", Mr. Kinkel  said, stressing the solutions offered by the peace plan which  would also affect Kosovo. German Foreign Minister Kinkel  believes that a solution should be found to the disputes between  Macedonia and Greece and that Greece should lift the embargo it  has imposed on Macedonia. In Sofia Mr. Kinkel also discussed  the events in Gorazde. "Serbian attacks on Gorazde are  unacceptable", the German foreign minister said. He added that  the solution depends to a great extent on Russian influence on  the Serbs.</p>

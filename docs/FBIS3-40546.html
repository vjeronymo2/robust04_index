			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Honda Motor Co. (Nobuhiko Kawamoto, president) and  Ovonic Battery Co. (OBC, headquartered in Michigan), a U.S.  venture company that produces electronic and electrical parts,  have agreed on the joint development of a next-generation  battery for electric vehicles and concluded a development  contract. This is the first time automobile-related Japanese  and U.S. corporations have joined hands to develop a  next-generation battery for electric vehicles. Based on this  contract, Honda will begin development of a practical battery  based on the nickel-hydrogen battery on which OBC has been  conducting research and development has over twice the storage  capacity and durability of conventional batteries, development  of a low-cost battery is envisioned at the time of its placement  on board electric vehicles.    In addition, because the battery does not include any lead  or  cadmium components, it is said to have the merit of being able  to avoid secondary environmental pollution. The contract  specifies that OBC will devise the design specs--based on the  next-generation battery that the company has developed--for  mounting in the electric vehicles that Honda is currently  developing, then develop a prototype. Honda will mount the  battery in its electric vehicles currently under use. Regarding  the contract, Honda, in addition to procuring a prototype  battery from OBC for research, test production, and testing,  will pursue technology exchange. Honda is paying OBC  approximately &yen;150 million for the next-generation battery  technology. With California--due to the problem of  environmental protection--introducing regulations by 1998  mandating that two percent of all vehicles sold there emit no  exhaust gases, the development of electric vehicles is becoming  hurried. But the development of high-performance batteries has  become the major prerequisite for that. Amidst such  developments, Honda is strengthening its development  capabilities in environmental-protection vehicles by joining  hands with a U.S. venture company with strength in a future  field of technology. OBC, a venture company that excels in new  materials development and chemical synthesis R&amp;D, is a  member of  the Energy Conversion Devices (ECD) group of companies. With  former General Motors chairman and chief executive officer  Stempel recently becoming chairman of ECD, the parent company,  the group is said to be strengthening its capabilities related  to automobiles.</p>

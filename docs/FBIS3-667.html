He added that  within a few hours there would be definite arrangements between  the South African Government and Bophuthatswana for the South  African Defence Force [SADF] to move into bophuthatswana and  help stabilise it.    The news conference heard SADF forces had been deployed in  Mmabatho and more were on standby.    Mr de Klerk welcomed Bophuthatswana President Lucas  Mangope's  decision to register for the elections and said he hoped this  would have an immediate stabilising effect on the territory. He  rejected the perception that the unrest had brought about Mr  Mangope's decision to register, and attributed this to the  continued negotiations between the Bophuhatswana government, the  South African Government and other interested parties.    SADF Chief Gen Georg Meiring and South African Police  Commissioner Johan van der Merwe left after lunch to appraise  the situation in Bophuthatswana and would also hold talks with  Bophuthatswanan's chiefs of police and Bophuthatswana Defence  Force.    On the violence and looting that erupted in the areas along  the border of South Africa and Bophuthatswana north of Pretoria,  Mr de Klerk said security forces had been deployed where  warranted.    Mr de Klerk said he had been in contact with African  National  Congress President Nelson Mandela, speaking to him twice on  Friday. Mr de Klerk said there had been good co-operation  between his government and the African National Congress [ANC].    The leadership of the ANC had acted responsibly and "we  worked well together". The same could not be said, however, of  the ANC supporters and their surrogate organisations.    Information at hand pointed to their involvement in creating  the situation and in fostering a volatile spirit.    Minister of Defence Kobie Coetsee said one facet of the  unrest was the presence of elements of private armies.</p>

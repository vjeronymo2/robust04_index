			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Leadership Contest: Beckett breaks with party policy on picketing Mrs Margaret Beckett yesterday sought to enhance her appeal to Labour traditionalists by calling for the return of secondary picketing as part of a root-and-branch reform of union law. In a move which infuriated supporters of the other two Labour leadership candidates, Mrs Beckett went beyond party policy by calling for laws allowing a 'sensible, workable and fair' approach to secondary picketing. Coming less than 24 hours after the left-led TGWU general union recommended her for the leadership, Mrs Beckett's move looks set to enliven the contest, putting daylight between the candidates on a specific policy issue for the first time. Mr Tony Blair, the favourite to succeed John Smith, this week rejected the notion that all union legislation passed by the Conservatives since 1979 should be scrapped, saying he did not think it would be 'sensible'. Mr John Prescott, the leading traditionalist candidate, has pledged to work for the repeal of sections of Tory legislation, without being specific. Interviewed on BBC radio, Mrs Beckett said that a sensible approach to secondary picketing was needed to ensure workers were not treated 'without any regard for reasonable industrial rights which would be enjoyed anywhere else in Europe'. She said there could well be 'a need just to sweep the board clear and start again, keeping those elements of existing legislation which people thought it was right to retain'. She added: 'There are things many unions would want to see retained - some of the methods of balloting and so on - but sometimes when you are trying to replace legislation you can't do it bit by bit, you have to have a new act and it may well be that is the right path to follow.' Blair and Prescott supporters accused Mrs Beckett of pandering to her backers in the TGWU. In a move more in keeping with the general trend among unions, the Unison public-services union decided against recommending any of the candidates. It said it had agreed 'strongly to encourage' all levy-paying members to exercise their own judgment. Mrs Beckett's remarks were seized upon by leading Conservatives who claimed they showed Labour was in disarray about its union policy. Sir Norman Fowler, the departing Tory chairman, said Mrs Beckett's decision to 'let the cat out of the bag' had left Labour in 'a total shambles'. He was supported by Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister, who told MPs that Mrs Beckett's backing for a return to secondary picketing suggested that a Labour government under her leadership would re-create the industrial problems of the 1970s.</p>

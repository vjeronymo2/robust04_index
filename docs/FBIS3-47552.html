Following the luncheon meeting, an official of the four  organizations told reporters, "the prime minister said he wants  to have the bills passed on 19 January and to have the next Diet  session revise them." But in answer to reporters' question at  the prime minister's mansion in the evening, Hosokawa denied the  story, saying: "That is not what I said. They asked me if I  expected the bills to be passed on 19 January. I told them that  will probably be difficult."</p>

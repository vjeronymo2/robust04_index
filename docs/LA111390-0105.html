			<p><P> November 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YELTSIN HOPEFUL OF KEY ACCORD WITH GORBACHEV;  </P> <P> SOVIET UNION: AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE TWO MEN ON SHARING NATURAL RESOURCES  WOULD HELP LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR ECONOMIC REFORMS.  </P> <P> After months of bitter wrangling, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his  principal rival, Boris N. Yeltsin, the president of the Russian Federation, may  be near a crucial agreement on how to share the country's natural resources and  industrial base, Yeltsin said Monday.  </P> <P> That agreement, if concluded soon, would help lay the foundation for economic  reforms and for a new treaty among the Soviet Union's constituent republics,  including Russia, the largest, on the country's future as a federal state.  </P> <P> Yeltsin, speaking after a weekend meeting with Gorbachev, said that, for the  first time, the central government has agreed to initially negotiate the key  issues of how to share the country's vast wealth and to manage its economy --  and only then to tackle how to restructure the Soviet Union and realign  relations among the republics and between them and Moscow.  </P> <P> "We experienced pressure until yesterday (Sunday)," Yeltsin told a commission  drafting a new Russian constitution. "That pressure was aimed at making us sign  a union treaty first and settle all other issues later. . . . We could not  accept that, and we won't."  </P> <P> But he and Gorbachev had agreed, first in two hours of one-on-one talks and  then in another three hours of talks with their prime ministers, that parallel  Soviet and Russian commissions would be established to settle the division of  powers between the central and republic governments, the ownership of  industrial enterprises and the use of natural resources.  </P> <P> The commissions would also discuss changes in the banking system, state  finances and economic management. They would then work together on drafting the  new union treaty, which Yeltsin said could be ready by the end of the year.  </P> <P> "The document delimiting functions (of the central and Russian governments)  will serve as the basis for the federal treaty," Yeltsin said.  </P> <P> But no treaty would be signed before there were also agreements on sharing of  natural resources -- including oil, natural gas and gold -- and on management  of the banking system and financing of the central budget.  </P> <P> As outlined by Yeltsin, the understanding reached with Gorbachev could help end  the prolonged impasse exacerbating the country's triple crisis: economic  disintegration virtually unchecked by any reforms; breakup of the Soviet Union  as a centralized state, and the inability of the present political situation to  resolve these and other issues.  </P> <P> Gorbachev has not commented on his discussions Sunday with Yeltsin, but it was  he who approached the Russian populist after a political meeting last week and  proposed the Kremlin talks.  </P> <P> The official Soviet news agency Tass described the talks between the two men as  "businesslike and principled."  </P> <P> Although much negotiation lies ahead, Gorbachev appears to have made  significant concessions in agreeing that the constituent republics can work out  in advance the terms on which they remain in Soviet Union and in recognizing  that they have a right, which takes precedence over the claims of the central  government, to the resources and enterprises on their territory.  </P> <P> Yeltsin, in return, committed himself and Russia to the Soviet Union and  against its breakup. "I am for a strong union and union treaty," Yeltsin said  Monday, denying suggestions made in the conservative press that he was  attempting to dismantle the Soviet Union even at the risk of civil war.  </P> <P> Whether this will end the feuding between Gorbachev and Yeltsin is uncertain,  but the two appear to understand that they need each other. "The two leaders  seem to be 'doomed' to cooperation, irrespective of their personal likes and  dislikes and their political rivalry," a political analyst for Tass wrote  Monday.  </P> <P> An alliance formed in early August collapsed last month amid angry  recriminations after Gorbachev refused to proceed with radical economic reforms  as agreed to with Yeltsin, who strongly favored a 500-day "forced march" to  develop a market economy.  </P> <P> But Yeltsin found that Russia could not proceed alone or carry out even modest  economic reforms without resolving what the central government owns and what  belongs to the republic as well as without agreeing about whose laws take  precedence.  </P> <P> "A clear-cut distribution of powers between the center and the republics, above  all Russia, would be the first step toward eliminating the vacuum of power at  various levels," Tass commentator Andrei Orlov wrote. "It would help remove the  dangerous uncertain in relations with other countries and give a fresh impetus  to economic reforms."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Washington, March 25 (XINHUA) -- Most of the U.S.  Senators now support renewal of China's most-favored-nation  (MFN) trade status, the chairman of the U.S. Senate Finance  Trade Subcommittee said here today.    Senator Max Baucus told reporters that issues of human  rights  and trade should not be linked because revoking China's MFN  status would cause great harm to both the United States and  China.    The linkage policy by the Clinton administration "is fraught  with confrontation and has achieved minimal success," Baucus  said. "No other country uses this blunderbuss approach," he  added.    A clear majority in the Senate now supports severing link  between China's human rights and trade and renewing China's MFN  trade status, Baucus added.</p>

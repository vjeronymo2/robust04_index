			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / International Company News: Cathay Pacific down by 46% CATHAY PACIFIC Airways, Swire Pacific's Hong Kong-based international airline, yesterday revealed first-half 1993 earnings of HKDollars 681m (USDollars 88m), down 46 per cent from 1992's HKDollars 1.26bn. The results were significantly below analysts' expectations, with the airline suffering from the weak performance of its routes to recession-hit Japan and Europe. Cathay Pacific was also seriously hit by the cabin attendants' strike during January, which Mr Peter Sutch, chairman, said had caused an estimated HKDollars 240m reduction in profits. Revenues of HKDollars 11bn were marginally up on the previous year. The interim dividend is being held at 10.5 cents a share. Mr Sutch said: 'Although the full year's results are expected to be materially lower than 1992, we expect that the second half-year's results will not show a percentage drop as great as indicated for the first half year.' Asia's airlines had previously shown themselves to be relatively recession-proof, but with rapidly-increasing capacity and internal competition, at a time of weak global markets, earnings are finally being hit. Mr Sutch said: 'The main cause of the drop in profits was the effect of the continuing recession in the company's major markets, particularly Japan and Europe.' Cathay has suffered the additional disadvantage of Hong Kong's high inflation; it was the airlines' push to control operating costs, that ultimately resulted in the flight attendants' strike. Passengers carried during the first half of the year totalled 4.1m, a rise of 3 per cent. However, the airline's load factor fell 3 per cent, as a result of increased capacity from two new aircraft.</p>

			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Bingham Report - Investigation into the BCCI scandal: BCCI problems not spotted early enough . . . . officials in the dark as debacle developed - Bingham warns against the case being viewed in isolation, pointing out the large workload of supervisors trying to halt the frauds. Richard Waters studies the main points of the report 'THE history of BCCI's supervision by all the UK authorities is a long story, extending over 19 years. It is also a complex story, involving a number of different authorities and parties in the UK and abroad. And it is a very dense story, because the supervisory attention paid to BCCI over the years was very great. It is not a story which readily lends itself to simple and categorical judgments.' Lord Justice Bingham's introduction to his own report into the BCCI collapse may warn against jumping to simple conclusions, but the overall conclusions seem clear: the Bank of England failed to take serious note of the BCCI problem early enough, and senior officials were often kept in the dark on the debacle that was developing. The report also warns against viewing the BCCI case in isolation. 'The supervisory problems which BCCI presented were tackled by busy men and women, often over- stretched and with other problems competing for their attention. Reading the story of BCCI alone may give a misleading impression that these events occurred in isolation. Of course they did not: they were to the supervisors part of an often very considerable workload . . . The systematic frauds now thought to have been practised in BCCI were on a scale which had never been known before.' 1972-79 There was little reason to resist BCCI's arrival in London in 1972. 'Abedi himself appeared to be an experienced and successful banker . . . It would not have been consistent with the City's role as a dynamic financial centre to have resisted entry by this apparently promising newcomer.' The backing of Bank of America, which owned 25 per cent of the new bank, was also seen as a strong comfort. However, constant - though unsubstantiated - rumours about the bank's probity and its unusual structure led in time to a proposal to incorporate the bank in the UK. It was only then - in 1978 - that the Bank discovered the worrying news that Bank of America was planning to pull out of BCCI. 'It revealed its intention, over a period, to withdraw from BCCI,' says the report. 'The reasons it gave were commercial, and it was at pains to disavow concern about BCCI's business as a cause. But the loss of this prestigious backer significantly undermined the Bank's confidence in BCCI, and Abedi's failure to reveal this important development . . . confirmed the Bank in its suspicion that he was a man whose frankness could not be relied on.' Under the 1979 Banking Act, the Bank was faced for the first time with the need to licence BCCI in the UK. It was aware of several adverse factors. 'The ownership of the group was not clear. The largest bloc of shares was owned by a Cayman company, ICIC Overseas, owned by another Cayman company, ICIC Holdings. But despite considerable probing by the Bank, satisfactory details of the ownership of ICIC Holdings were never forthcoming. It was suspected that BCCI was financing the purchase of a considerable tranche of its own shares.' Other factors included: 'The general balance of market opinion, at home and abroad, was adverse, ranging from wariness of the unknown through unease to outright (but unsubstantiated) hostility.' 'The group was dominated by and excessively dependent upon the personality and skills of a single man, Abedi. He could not be trusted to disclose unwelcome news to the Bank or any other supervisor.' 'The group's operations were characterised by ostentatious expenditure and lavish entertainment.' A further consideration, says Bingham, was whether the bank should have been regarded as having its main centre of activities in the UK - a question the Bank never addressed. 'In my view the evidence is clear that London was by 1979-80, if not much earlier, the effective head office of . . . the group.' The Bank did not face these questions, and therefore did not consider it necessary to consider granting the bank a licence. That, says the report, could have been a crucial moment in the bank's history. 'Refusal of a licence would, in all probability, have caused loss to depositors and other creditors and exposed the Bank to accusations of racial prejudice, xenophobia and so on. In the real world such considerations are bound to intrude. But in the real world the choice did not lie simply between the grant and refusal of a licence. 'Had Abedi been denied the use of a banking name, as he should have been, it would have been a bitter blow and would have been a strong additional inducement to do all in his power to meet the Bank's supervisory requirements with a view to obtaining recognition, if not at once, at least in the foreseeable future.' 1980-88 By 1982, Mr Brian Gent, a deputy head of banking supervision, had come to the conclusion that the only way to supervise BCCI properly would be to force it to incorporate in the UK and regulate the whole group from there. 'The thrust of his argument was that no supervisory authority other than the Bank could reasonably be expected to take on the supervision of BCCI and that the Bank should do so, rather than let a large international group continue in business on a largely unsupervised basis.' However, by the time this plan had been developed and put to BCCI in 1984, it was quickly squashed. 'Abedi, usually compliant (at least overtly) and ingratiating, was on this occasion truculent and angry. The Bank's initiative, under consideration for nearly two years, thus fell at the first fence. 'It is true that there were no grounds for fearing imminent catastrophe. There were, indeed, no substantiated grounds for immediate apprehension. But it was appreciated that no one had a clear overall view of the group's operations. There was concern about what might be happening out of sight. If a sail has to be changed, it is better to change it before, not after, a storm has blown up. It is unfortunate that this promising initiative was so quickly snuffed out.' The Bank's failure to take a stronger line with Mr Abedi prompts some concern. 'Given the potential importance of the end in view, I find it surprising that no effort was made to bring the Bank's traditional authority to bear on Abedi to seek to secure his compliance. . . . But as matters appeared at the time, the Bank was, I think, rather easily deterred.' By 1985, however, the Bank no longer favoured the idea of supervising the whole of BCCI. 'I find it harder to understand why consolidated supervision by the Bank, endorsed at the highest levels of the Bank not so long before, was now so firmly rejected. The answer is perhaps to be found in Johnson Matthey Bankers. In the aftermath of that episode substantial additional demands were made on the Bank's supervisory resources and the Bank may well have been wary of undertaking new and risky assignments which, if the worst happened, would expose it to renewed criticism.' Concerns were quick to resurface. Late in 1985, Price Waterhouse was brought in to investigate large losses in BCCI's treasury division. It identified losses of Dollars 285m. The UK authorities' reaction: encourage BCCI to move its treasury operations to the Gulf region. 'The central treasury losses also caused the Bank to back away from the scheme for local incorporation. That was an understandable decision, but I think a questionable one. It was understandable because the central treasury losses episode underlined the difficulty of supervising BCCI and reinforced the Bank's distrust of the management's willingness to disclose bad news. It was questionable, because supervision is not a reward for good behaviour but a safeguard against bad, and this episode should have strengthened the Bank's existing view that closer and better supervision was called for.' Shifting problems overseas was not 'an adequate supervisory response', says Lord Justice Bingham. 'The place for a refractory pupil is in the front row, not in a dark corner at the back. The central treasury's recent history did not suggest that supervision was unnecessary.' In the following year, Luxembourg made a direct appeal to Mr Leigh-Pemberton for the Bank to take over worldwide supervision of BCCI. He declined. 'The clear balance of opinion in the Bank, particularly among the most senior supervisors, was strongly against the Bank undertaking this responsibility. The view was put that it was Luxembourg's problem and Luxembourg had to solve it. That was only partly true. Certainly Luxembourg had a problem, because (BCCI) was registered and licensed there . . . But it was also the Bank's problem because BCCI's effective base (apart from the central treasury) was in the UK, it was widely perceived as a British bank and UK depositors stood to lose much more than those of Luxembourg if things went wrong.' The Bank's reservations about taking on the job were understandable, though. 'Had the Bank accepted the burden of supervising the worldwide operations of a BCCI incorporated and based in the UK, its task would indeed have been formidable. The group traded in over 70 countries, in many of which supervision was weak or non-existent. In the absence of trust, a more intrusive style of supervision than the Bank ordinarily practised would have been needed. The cost would have been great. The demands on trained super-visory personnel would have been very difficult to meet. But this was by far the most hopeful solution, possibly the only hopeful solution.' By 1987, another idea was proposed by the Luxembourg authorities: a network of locally incorporated subsidiaries around the world. Mr Rodney Galpin, then in charge of banking supervision, resisted this idea, concerned that 'supervision of a UK subsidiary was likely to lead the Bank into the role of lead supervisor which it sought to avoid.' Also: 'The Bank doubted whether it could be satisfied (as required before an institution could be authorised under the 1987 Act) that it would be run prudently and with integrity, although the Bank could continue to rely on (the Luxemburg regulators') assurances in respect of SA. He offered the Bank's co-operation by intensifying its supervision of UK branches of SA, sharing information and discussing changes in the central role of London in the group.' This response, says the report, was inadquate. 'Even allowing for the fact that Jaans (the head of banking superivsion in Luxembourg) and Galpin were engaged, however politely, in a negotiation, I find Galpin's reply disappointing. There is no doubt of the Bank's intense desire at this time to avoid being drawn into a leading supervisory role. But that risk very largely arose because of the leading position occupied by the UK in the group, however unwelcome that position might be (and was). The commercial realities would not be changed by pretending they did not exist.' Eventually, banking regulators agreed to set up a 'college' arrangement in which they would co-operate to oversee BCCI. 'The college was seen by the supervisors and PW (Price Waterhouse) as an advance on the clearly unsatisfactory supervisory regime then in force,' says Bingham. 'But it was a second-best solution. No one thought it likely to be as effective as a single, efficient consolidated supervisor, and the establishment of the college did not of itself do anything to tackle the root of the problem, which lay in the structure of the group.' By 1988, accusations of fraud were becoming stronger: the City of London Fraud Squad was investigating an aspect of the bank, and diplomatic sources passed on concern reported by a chartered accountant working in the Gulf. Although both were 'serious and specific,' there was no follow-up. 'In view of the critical opinions widely held about BCCI and the considerable detail which the police supplied, I find it hard to understand the Bank's apparent lack of interest in establishing the truth. In the second case, the incident occurred outside the UK and had nothing to do with the UK branches of . . . the group. But it appeared to have a direct bearing on the ownership of the group and the integrity of its management. It may be that the Bank discounted the reliability of this report because of other suggestions it contained. If so, I think, its source justified more serious treatment, and it is indisputable that follow-up was possible. In this instance also I find it hard to understand how any supervisory official could think it right to leave such allegations unexplored.' Abedi 'On 9 February 1988, while in Pakistan, Abedi had a heart attack. Two weeks later he suffered a second, more serious attack. A heart specialist flew out to examine him and diagnosed serious damage. Shortly afterwards he was flown to the UK and a heart transplant operation was performed at Harefield Hospital on 9 March 1988. After a long stay in hospital he was followed up as an out-patient until December 1990. 'With the consent of Mrs Abedi the inquiry obtained a report from Abedi's UK surgeons. This disclosed severe neurological damage sustained before the operation. Although this report was based on an examination about a year earlier, the surgeons did not expect major improvement and their report is consistent with accounts given by those who have seen him recently.' Lord Justice Bingham's views on the founder and guiding light of BCCI cast him in a more generous light than some other commentators have, principally for his ambition of opening a bank to benefit the developing world. 'There was nobility in this ideal which, by his ambition, energy and flair, he did much to realise. The vices which brought BCCI down should not obscure the virtues which it showed in some places and which, perhaps, inspired its creation.' 'While my impressions of Abedi are inevitably second-hand, I have had the opportunity of speaking to many who knew him well and had dealings with him. He remains something of an enigma,' says Bingham. 'His hold over the staff, particularly the Pakistani staff, of BCCI was almost mesmeric, and he very favourably impressed a number of seasoned politicians. But there were others who recoiled. His oft-expounded and much-publicised semi-mystical philosophy, seen by many in BCCI as an inspiration, was viewed by others as tedious rubbish. While preaching the need for humility, he was thought by some who knew him well to be a man of overweening arrogance and considerable personal vanity. He combined his advocacy of the poor and oppressed with a personal life of flamboyant opulence and a driving ambition for power. If he is to be given credit for his ideals, he is to be debited with an inordinate endowment of low cunning, manifested in many ways and not least in his assiduous cultivation of those who by virtue of their wealth or position could be used to his advantage.' The conviction of BCCI employees on money-laundering charges in the US in the late 1980s brought some of the deepest soul-searching among regulators, with the Bank of England for a while imposing a daily reporting requirement on BCCI to detect any run on the bank. Bingham himself concludes, though, that there is no evidence that senior executives were involved in the crime. 'It has never (to my know- . . . officials in the dark as debacle developedledge) been suggested that the directors or controllers of SA were party to the money-laundering conspiracy. Nor is there evidence known to me that senior managers were implicated. Those indicted were not managers of SA within the statutory definition, as the Bank rightly held. 'But the Schedule (to the Banking Act) makes clear that fitness and properness involves not only probity but also competence, soundness of judgment and diligence. Elsewhere, the requirement of prudence is stated in general terms. There were, as it seems to me, questions to be asked about the judgment and competence of the board and management when BCCI bought its minority interest in BCC Colombia in 1983 and its majority interest in 1985. 'The likelihood of involvement in handling the proceeds of drug-trafficking could scarcely have eluded a competent and diligent banker contemplating such an investment, particularly if he had branches in Panama and agencies in Florida. While it is true that money-laundering became an increasingly high-profile subject throughout the 1980s, it was not an activity in which a banker of probity would knowingly have engaged in 1983. 'Whether BCCI failed to recognise the risk, or recognised and discounted it, or recognised and accepted it, or recognised and took what were thought to be adequate precautions, I do not know. This inquiry was never made. I think it was a pertinent inquiry, to which a rigorous supervisor would have wished to know the answer.' 1989 By the end of the 1980s, BCCI's structure had once again returned to the top of the supervisors' agenda and was the subject of discussion between Lord Callaghan, the former Labour prime minister, and the governor of the Bank of England. 'Partly at least as a result of approaches made to the Bank by Lord Callaghan a little earlier, fresh thought was given to structural and supervisory questions,' says the report. 'When Abedi was unable, through illness, to continue running the group, he shared his thoughts with Lord Callaghan, who also on occasion acted as an unofficial adviser to the group. Lord Callaghan came to feel that the group had somewhat lost its direction in the absence of Abedi's leadership and that its best future lay . . . in relocation of the group in the UK, subject to the supervision of the Bank. A meeting was arranged with the governor on May 25 1989 at which Lord Callaghan advanced this proposal.' Once again, however, due in part to a lack of agreement among bank executives over the best way to proceed, nothing was done. Meanwhile, events were moving swiftly towards the final closure of the group. Price Waterhouse, which had become sole group auditors of the bank, were approached by an employee of the bank who claimed evidence of fraud. The man, not named in the Bingham report, seems to have precipitated the events that led to the closure. 'The informant was a senior officer of BCCI outside the UK with access to good information. To protect his personal safety his identity must be withheld, although it has been made known in strict confidence to the inquiry. He began to give information to a PW partner ('P') in October 1989. 'The informant was not easy to assess. He tended to speak in riddles, to make suggestions about areas to be investigated, to drop hints. P followed up the leads and hints he was given. Some led, or appeared to lead, nowhere. But over a period P increasingly came to regard the informant as fundamentally honest and accurate. 'P's partners, who did not enjoy P's direct relationship with the informant, were more sceptical, and took longer to be convinced of the informant's reliability and good faith. There was accordingly a period during which, within PW, there was some doubt about the reliability of the informant's often rather enigmatic communications.' By February 1990, Price Waterhouse felt able to go to the Bank to discuss its growing fears. 'In communicating with the Bank in this way, (Tim) Hoult and (Christopher) Cowan felt they were taking an exceptional step. They went to the Bank and entered separately to avoid any risk of being seen by any representative of BCCI. 'They agreed with Barnes, who was alone, that because of the extreme secrecy of the meeting no note should be taken. It was a short meeting and recollections of it differ. I am, however, sure that Hoult communicated PW's doubts about the probity of BCCI, giving some of their grounds . . . Barnes asked whether they considered (Swaleh) Naqvi (BCCI's chief executive) to be fundamentally honest. 'Hoult said that Cowan had very serious doubts about Naqvi's honesty but he himself was as yet unconvinced of his dishonesty. Barnes' recollection, that PW came to tell him that the audit was not proceeding too smoothly and that they were having difficulty getting the information they needed from Naqvi, is in my view mistaken, although he thinks that if the informant had been mentioned he would have remembered it. 'I find it surprising that this meeting made so little impression on Barnes,' Bingham concludes. 'After years of criticism, and after Tampa (the money-laundering convictions), here was a suggestion of dishonesty from an unimpeachable source pointing at the chief executive of the group. Barnes' impassivity on receiving this message seems to me to show a rooted unwillingness to believe ill of BCCI.' A second meeting with Barnes was arranged for March 2. And although Barnes reported five days later to the Bank's board of banking supervision, 'he gave the board no hint of PW's communication. He judged it inappropriate to tell the board of what were no more than suspicions. While respecting his motives, I consider this a misjudgment. This was, after all, PW's second visit, and no one but he knew of the first. 'Even unsubstantiated suspicions from such a source are of significance. One of the results was that the Board of Banking Supervision, and the governors, were not at this point alerted to serious doubts about the integrity of the chief executive of the group.' In April 1990, PW produced its most damaging report on the group so far, prompting another visit by Hoult and Cowan to the Bank 'to deliver a copy'. However, what followed was a catalogue of bad communication: 'Barnes declined to receive a copy because of the Bank's delicate position vis-a-vis the (Luxembourg regulators). So Hoult went through the salient points in the report. 'It is, I think, clear from the only note of the meeting (which was made by Miss Jones and which, though not comprehensive, was substantially accurate) that Hoult concentrated on the immediate financial crisis and the need for very substantial shareholder support. 'But it seems he made no express reference to fraud or malpractice of any kind, and he went into little detail save, to some extent, of the Gokal loans. It is surprising, and unfortunate, that the Bank's attention was not expressly drawn to the fitness and properness implications of the report.' Nevertheless, the PW report was more widely circulated in the Bank later in the month. PW 'accordingly assumed that the inferences to be drawn from the report, as they thought clearly, would be drawn by the Bank. This was not what happened. 'Although Beverly read the report and found it a 'shock' and a 'devastating report to read', it is questionable whether he drew from it any inference of deception or malpractice. Barnes, if he read the report at the time at all, read it briskly and understood it to concentrate on the financial problem outlined by PW on April 18 1990. 'Quinn saw the report at the time and appreciated it disclosed a serious financial crisis, but may not have read the whole of the text very carefully and the report raised no real doubt in his mind about the integrity of Naqvi and Abedi.' PW's report failed to ring alarm bells at all levels of the Bank. 'In April 1990 (and for a number of months afterwards) the governors, the Board of Banking Supervision, Quinn and Barnes were unaware of the serious doubt thrown by PW on the integrity of the bank's most senior management.' As BCCI's problems became more serious, it was forced to rely more heavily on the Gulf state whose interests had become its major shareholder: Abu Dhabi. The result was that Abu Dhabi came to learn of problems at BCCI before the Bank or PW, says Bingham. 'When, in the spring of 1990, it was plain that BCCI faced financial disaster, Naqvi appealed to the Abu Dhabi shareholders to rescue the group. He admitted to them that the group had made large losses. An attempt to staunch these losses by Central Treasury dealing had, he said, led to even greater losses. 'To try and prop up the bank he and Abedi had misappropriated funds amounting to Dollars 2.2 billion from the (Abu Dhabi) Ruling Family's portfolio which they managed. It seems clear that this misappropriation was admitted by Naqvi, and understood by the Abu Dhabi shareholders, to have been dishonest. But Naqvi pleaded that BCCI was basically a sound and profitable enterprise and begged the Abu Dhabi shareholders to support it.' Bingham warns that his report has been produced without substantial input from Abu Dhabi. Naqvi 'is under restraint in Abu Dhabi', while 'Mazrui's own understanding is not easy to assess.' But he adds: 'The Abu Dhabi authorities are not, however, untutored innocents in the world of international finance, and I cannot think they were as greatly deceived as they suggest. 'Unhappily, the Abu Dhabi shareholders did not at the same time communicate to either the supervisors or the auditors even the outline of what Naqvi had revealed to them. It was to be nine months before the misuse of the Ruling Family's portfolio became known to PW and the Bank. 'I have to regard this as a serious and potentially influential omission, even if the Abu Dhabi shareholders' understanding was as they say. They point out (quite correctly) that Naqvi's estimates were unverified and unsubstantiated, and suggest that they viewed them with some scepticism. I find this unconvincing.' The final year of BCCI's existence could have been cut short had Abu Dhabi acted differently: 'Had the full facts known to them been communicated to PW and the supervisors in April 1990, it seems likely either that all concerned would have embarked on a group restructuring programme with a much fuller investigation and understanding of the malpractice which had existed in the past and of the level of support required, or that the bank would have been closed or would have collapsed there and then.' The blame was not all on Abu Dhabi's side: banking regulators themselves failed to encourage better communication. 'It is . . . unfortunate in retrospect that the supervisors did not, at this critical juncture in BCCI's affairs, seize the opportunity to establish direct personal contact with the top levels of the Abu Dhabi government: had senior representatives of the Bank and the IML succeeded in discussing the existing situation and the future at this stage, all involved might have had a clearer understanding of the others' position over the months ahead and it is to be hoped that more detail of Naqvi's revelations would have emerged.' Communication was not helped by the Bank's traditional ways of going about its business. For 'presentational' reasons, the banking supervisors did not want to travel to Abu Dhabi in the summer of 1990. 'I think this was unfortunate. City tradition is that the world attends upon the Bank. This is, no doubt, a beneficial tradition. But the Bank was dealing with a proud and independent government not reared in this tradition and in the throes of a serious local crisis. There was an urgent need, in the interests of UK and other depositors, to impress on the government the finality of the IML ultimatum and the necessity to find a solution.' Meanwhile, more evidence revealed to PW by senior BCCI employees showed that the size of the hole in the bank was even bigger than they had feared. 'PW were shocked to learn of these new facts, because of the figures involved, because Iqbal had apparently not been free to make the revelations before and because of the deception apparently involved. 'PW once more feared for the survival of the bank and thought it necessary to see the majority shareholders again urgently. So Hoult and Cowan returned to Abu Dhabi on 29 September 1990. They told the Bank they were going, but not of the reason for the visit beyond referring to financial problems: asked for a ball-park figure, they thought that the shortfall on certain assets might be Dollars 1.5bn, which would be needed in the form of new capital, the take-out of certain loans by the shareholders, provisions and guarantees.' Again, the Bank was not told of fears about deception at the bank. A lack of communication meant that 'both PW and the Bank were restricted in their understanding of the situation . . . The majority shareholders had not told PW or the Bank of Naqvi's revelations, even as to the misuse of the Ruling Family's portfolio. PW for their part had not told the Bank of . . . remarks about manipulation of Gokal accounts, the ownership of First American by BCCI nominees and the failure of BCCI to make a profit . . . Nor had they mentioned Iqbal's remarks on 26 September and the fact that he had not apparently been free to make these revelations before.' October 1990 In October, PW produced its latest in a series of damning reports on the bank, leading eventually to Naqvi's departure. Yet even this failed to produce a strong reaction from the Bank of England. 'Bartlett, who read the report, was understandably struck by the serious financial situation it disclosed. He did not at the time read the reference to collusion with major customers to misstate or disguise the underlying purpose of significant transactions as 'a very strong suggestion of dishonesty', although with the benefit of hindsight he now does. 'This report was not widely circulated within the Bank. Neither Barnes nor Quinn saw it until after the closure of the bank in July 1991.' The Bank of England was concerned mainly about the financial predicament of the bank. The implications about the behaviour of senior executives did not appear uppermost in its mind. Bingham says: 'I find it hard to understand why the fitness and properness aspects of this report made so little impact on the minds of those who did read it in the Bank. For any bank to be accused of colluding with customers to misstate or disguise the underlying purpose of significant transactions should be a very serious thing to a supervisor responsible for monitoring compliance with the statutory criteria. 'In failing to appreciate and react to the implications of this report the Bank was in my view at fault. But it was not solely at fault. The report did not convey, in a blunt and unmistakable way, the full extent of PW's concerns following their conversations with Habroush and Iqbal. Nor had the majority shareholders revealed the full effect of Naqvi's revelations in April.' By early in 1991, the picture developing before the auditors was beginning to look even worse. Naqvi revealed for the first time the existence of substantial fictitious loans. 'PW were conscious that Naqvi's revelations had not been verified by detailed investigation and they were sceptical of his assumption of sole responsibility. But they could see no reason why he should make damaging admissions which were untrue and much of what he said corroborated what Iqbal had said earlier. 'They were inclined to regard Naqvi's disclosures as, in all probability, a fairly comprehensive account of the fraud practised in the bank. They did not report this conversation to the Bank . . . Again, I find this puzzling and think the omission was very unfortunate.' In April, PW conveyed more of their concerns to the Bank. Yet the reaction was inadequate, says Bingham: 'Although . . . Bartlett was much concerned at the size of the financial support which this conversation showed to be necessary, the reported theft of very large sums by Abedi and Naqvi from the Ruling Family of Abu Dhabi caused remarkably little stir in the Bank. 'Barnes, to whom the note of this meeting was copied, did not attach great importance to this aspect of it because it related to past events and former management who, however disgracefully they had behaved, had no place in the future plans of the group. It was a matter between the shareholders and the former management. 'Quinn confirmed that no thought was given to revocation at this time . . . It was doubtless for reasons of this kind that no indication of this sizable theft was made to the Board of Banking Supervision and the governors until after the closure of the bank. I consider this reaction strange.' Even as late as April, less than three months before the closure, the Bank was not particularly worried about BCCI's future, believing as it did that Abu Dhabi support assured the bank's future. Bingham says: 'It is not easy in retrospect to understand how the Bank and PW could in early April 1991 have been other than pessimistic about the future. The (Luxembourg regulators') deadline had three months to run. The financial package had not been finally signed, so the group was still technically insolvent. The accounts, already overdue, would be still further delayed and would show huge losses. The final outcome of the various investigations in progress was not known but must on past experience have appeared likely (particularly to PW) to produce disturbing revelations. The prospect of hostile proceedings and adverse publicity in the US had not receded. Even the basic decisions on the future structure of the group had not been taken, and there was no realistic possibility that a detailed structural plan, approved by the shareholders and the relevant supervisors, would be available by the end of June. The directors and managers of the new banks (wherever they might be) had not for the most part been appointed. 'I find it surprising that there was not a sense of impending crisis, and that the Bank did not judge this (latest) college meeting . . . to merit the personal attendance of one of its most senior supervisors. But it must be very doubtful whether anything the Bank could reasonably have done at this stage would have averted the ultimate collapse of the group.' The Bank, meanwhile continued to look for an Abu Dhabi bail-out of BCCI. 'There is room for very real doubt whether, in view of what it had learned (and should have understood) about the business of BCCI, particularly over the preceding 18 months, the Bank was well-advised to give even provisional blessing to these restructuring plans until the past had been comprehensively explored or a clear understanding for the future reached with the majority shareholders.' The Bank's lack of preparation for the impending crisis is shown by the fact that its head of supervision was actually on holiday at the time BCCI was finally closed. 'Reading the Bank's contemporaneous records, I discern no sense of impending crisis. Had any crisis been expected, it would hardly have been thought satisfactory for Barnes, as Head of the Banking Supervision Division, to go on holiday on 21 June without plans for his return or consultation in case of emergency. (As it was, and although he left a telephone number, the Bank did not communicate with him during what turned out to be the crucial fortnight which culminated in the closure of the bank. The first he knew of the closure was when he returned from holiday on 6 July 1991 and read of it in the newspaper.) @Whsh . . . the overdue 1990 accounts unapproved, the shareholders' support unconfirmed, their global restructuring plans incomplete and the continuing threat of damaging US revelations, it is hard in retrospect to understand why the course ahead did not appear more hazardous.' It was against this background of apparent complacency at the Bank that, in July, PW delivered its bombshell: a final, damning report, which the Bank of England had itself commissioned three months before. Its effect on the regulators was immediate. 'Bartlett was clearly somewhat shaken by the report, both by its strong language and because it went further than earlier reports. Cowan thought there was not very much new in it, and suggested that its impact was the result of including all the various threads in one place . . . 'Quinn read the draft section 41 report overnight on Wednesday 26 June. He found it devastating. His mind was in no way prepared for it. Had he been fully alive to the story as, in a piecemeal way, it had unfolded to the Bank . . . he would still have been much struck by the comprehensive and cumulative effect of the draft report, but its contents could scarcely have come as quite such a complete surprise.' Within days, BCCI had been closed - at least one action which draws applause from Bingham: 'Given the decision to close BCCI without advance notice to the majority shareholders or management, the closure itself was well-planned and very skilfully executed.' The decision to close BCCI - something which has itself drawn widespread criticism - is also supported by Bingham. 'There was no course open to the Bank which offered a quick and complete solution to all outstanding problems without loss, or the risk of loss. 'All the courses open were to a greater or lesser extent unattractive as liable to cause loss. But the Bank had a statutory duty to protect the interests of UK depositors. Its judgment that those interests were best served, as matters stood, by closure was strongly supported by the Board of Banking Supervision. 'And while a judgment based on that ground alone might be open to criticism (the Banking Act 1987 apart) as unacceptably chauvinistic, it was a judgment which commanded very wide assent among other supervisory authorities. It cannot be plausibly argued, in my opinion, that the course which the Bank took was not an appropriate one, even though it was not the only possible course . . . 'That, however, leaves unanswered an important question, whether PW's draft section 41 report should have come to the Bank as the devastating surprise it did. In my opinion it certainly should not. 'It would not have done so if the Bank had been more alert in receiving and understanding the messages it was given, if those messages (received and understood) had been more consistently brought to the attention of the most senior echelons in the Bank and the Board of Banking Supervision and if the Bank had more actively pursued the leads it was given.' The Bank's decision to close BCCI without first talking to Abu Dhabi also receives support from Bingham. Abu Dhabi 'felt deeply wounded that such action should have been taken in this way by a country with which Abu Dhabi has, over many years, enjoyed close ties of trust and friendship. I am not at all surprised by these reactions, fired as they were by an unjustified but potent suspicion that the Bank was guilty of duplicity, and they must be a matter for deep regret. But I do not think the Bank's decision to give no effective advance notice to the majority shareholders can be criticised as wrong.' Bingham's conclusion: 'This history was, in its later stages, a tragedy of errors, misunderstandings and failures of communication . . . 'Public attention has naturally focused most closely on the last 15 months of BCCI's active existence, which was indeed a period of crucial significance. But the problems which then came to light, in large measure through the work of PW and the investigating team, had their roots deep in the past. Prime responsibility of course rests with those who devised, directed and implemented the frauds which were practised. Whether the frauds could and should have been discovered by the auditors earlier is an issue I have not been asked to investigate.' At the end, the Bank of England remains central, says Bingham. 'The Bank did not pursue the truth about BCCI with the rigour which BCCI's market reputation justified. In the later stages the Bank came to rely to an excessive extent, in my opinion, on the auditors: under the British system of supervision the auditors have a crucial role to play but the duty to supervise is placed on the Bank and it is a duty which cannot be delegated. It is the Bank, not the auditor, which is the supervisor. In these respects the Bank's supervisory approach to BCCI was in my opinion deficient. How different the course of events would have been had these deficiencies not existed, one can only speculate.'

The term ``wheel inserts'' does not include washers or wheel spacers, which are not inserted through a studhole. The subject wheel inserts may or may not have a surface coating and may or may not be heat-treated. The surface coating could include chrome plating, nickel plating, zinc plating (with or without wax coating), oxide coating, and powder coating. Wheel inserts are produced in a variety of sizes depending on the type of wheel and the size of the stud hole into which they are inserted; the shape of the insert interface may be spherical (called a ball seat) or conical to fit the lug nut or wheel lock which is attached to the stud.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For further information concerning the conduct of these investigations and rules of general application, consult the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, part 201, subparts A through E (19 CFR part 201), and part 207, subparts A and B (19 CFR part 207).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  September 15, 1994.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Mary Messer (202&hyph;205&hyph;3193), Office of Investigations, U.S. International Trade Commission, 500 E Street SW., Washington, DC 20436.

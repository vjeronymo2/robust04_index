			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cleaning operation. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Periods of non-compliance would be transmitted to the EPA in a semiannual report. An example of non-compliance for hand-wipe cleaning is the use of a cleaning solvent with a vapor pressure greater than 45 mm Hg (24.1 in. H <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> O at 68  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F) and does not conform to the approved composition list in a nonexempt cleaning operation. In addition, any instance where a leaking enclosed spray gun cleaner is not repaired within 15 days would be considered an instance of non-compliance that would trigger a semiannual report.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA is also proposing a semiannual reporting requirement if changes, such as the use of new cleaning solvents, previously reported cleaning solvents no longer in use, or new cleaning techniques for spray guns, are made to the cleaning operations at the facility. Where a new or reformulated cleaning solvent is used, the semiannual report would include documentation of its vapor pressure or documentation that it conforms to the approved composition list.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the cleaning operation has been in compliance for the annual period, then an annual report would be required occurring every 12 months from the date of the initial report stating that the cleaning operation has been in compliance with the applicable standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Primer, topcoat, and chemical milling maskant application operations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A semiannual report would be required whenever an exceedance of organic HAP or VOC content levels occurred, as well as any time a primer or topcoat application operation was not immediately shut down when the pressure drop across the filters or waterwash was out of range. Where control devices are used to comply with the organic HAP or VOC content levels, the EPA is also proposing to require semiannual reporting whenever a monitored parameter falls outside its appropriate range. Such situations indicate noncompliance with the proposed standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If no exceedances occur, each owner and operator would submit annual statements indicating that each affected facility has been in compliance. The annual reports for primer and topcoat operations would also identify the number of times, if any, the pressure drop limits for each filter or waterwash system were exceeded.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Depainting Operations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  If new non-chemical depainting techniques are introduced to the facility since the filing of the notification of compliance status or any subsequent semiannual report, the EPA is proposing semiannual reports to identify these techniques. The semiannual report would be required to identify any period of malfunction of non-chemical depainting methods and techniques and any period where the non-chemical depainting operation was not immediately shut down when the pressure drop across the filters was out of range.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For periods of malfunction of non-chemical depainting methods, semiannual reports would be required that identify the method or technique that malfunctioned, the date that the malfunction occurred and was corrected, a description of the malfunction, the alternative method(s) used for depainting during the period of malfunction, and the date(s) that the methods were begun and discontinued. This information is necessary so that adequate documentation is available to ascertain whether malfunctions were repaired within the 15 day limit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the facility would be required to report on a semiannual basis any new chemical strippers or changes to existing formulations and the organic HAP content of each. A semiannual report would also be required for each 24-hour period where organic HAP were emitted from the depainting operation, other than from spot, radome, or parts stripping or decal removal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the semiannual report would be required to identify all changes in the type of aircraft depainted at the facility and to identify the parts normally removed for depainting separate from the aircraft for each new type of aircraft depainted. This is important because of the exemption being proposed for radomes and parts that are normally removed prior to depainting the aircraft.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

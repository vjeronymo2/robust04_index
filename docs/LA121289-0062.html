			<p><P> December 12, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAWYER URGES FREEZING KEATING ASSETS  </P> <P> A lawyer for small investors in the parent of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan argued  Monday in federal court in Los Angeles that the corporation was run for the  benefit of Charles H. Keating Jr. and his family and that a federal judge  therefore can order a worldwide freeze of Keating family assets.  </P> <P> Some 22,000 investors claim in a class-action lawsuit that the $200 million in  debt securities they purchased at 29 Southern California branches of the Irvine  thrift provided Keating with a lavish life style and bank accounts in Europe  and the Caribbean.  </P> <P> But whether as Lincoln or as its parent firm, American Continental Corp. in  Phoenix, the business is controlled by Keating, said Joseph W. Cotchett Jr. of  Burlingame, one of the lawyers for the bondholders. That control gives  investors the right to go after Keating's personal assets, he charged.  </P> <P> But a lawyer for the beleaguered Arizona businessman contended that Keating  never held himself out as being personally responsible to the small investors  and that they do not have a right to freeze his personal funds.  </P> <P> James Ham of Los Angeles also said Keating had no funds in foreign bank  accounts, as the investors allege. And American Continental spokesman Bradley  J. Boland, one of Keating's sons-in-law, said after the hearing that the  company is fighting in various courts to revive itself and pay off bondholders  and other creditors.  </P> <P> U.S. District Court Judge Stephen V. Wilson decided to continue the hearing to  Dec. 21 to give himself time to read additional documents filed in the case.  The hearing, Wilson said, could be canceled if he decides for Keating on the  basis of the written arguments.  </P> <P> The bondholders sued Keating and others in a series of fraud and civil  racketeering lawsuits in state and federal courts over the April collapse of  Lincoln and American Continental. The holding company filed for bankruptcy  protection on April 13, and regulators seized Lincoln the next day.  </P> <P> Lincoln's failure could be the costliest ever, with taxpayers picking up a  $2-billion bill.  </P> <P> Plaintiffs in the latest suit claim that much of the money raised through the  bond sales -- some $34 million -- went to salaries, stock purchases and other  benefits for Keating and his family. More money was spent on such lavish items  as three corporate jets even as the company was struggling financially,  Cotchett claimed.  </P> <P> The suit seeks to freeze what investors say is more than $100 million in assets  of Keating and his family in such places as Switzerland, Panama and the  Bahamas. Keating, however, in a written court statement, said American  Continental's connections with overseas banks and brokerage houses were  strictly for foreign currency trading and for consulting fees on such trading.  </P> <P> "I do not have bank accounts at any of these banks," he said. "I do not have  any overseas bank accounts. I am not aware, nor do I believe, that any of my  family maintain (sic) bank accounts at any of these banks, or for that matter,  at any overseas bank."  </P></p>

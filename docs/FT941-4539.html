			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading The retreat in US and German bonds continued to exact a toll on stock index futures, leaving the near month contract in the doldrums after early attempts at a rally, writes Joel Kibazo. There was a firm start to trading in the March contract on the FT-SE 100 after it opened at 3,255. But having touched 3,262, demand for the contract petered out. Independent traders took the lead in selling and the contract surrendered the early gain, drifting lower over the next few hours in subdued trade. Dealers kept an eye on bond markets and the first signs of a slide in German and US bonds brought active selling of March. It ended at 3,237, down 12 from its previous close and about 3 points below its fair value premium of minus 8. Volume at the official close was 13,328 lots, and good activity in the June contract brought turnover of 2,818. In the FT-SE Mid 250 Index on the Liffe, turnover was 351 lots as it closed at 3,917. On the OMLX, volume in the same contract rose to 60 lots. It ended at 3,913. Liffe traded options had a quiet session, with volume falling to 30,633. The FT-SE 100 option traded 12,964, while Ladbroke was the busiest stock option with a total of 2,331 deals, followed by Argyll at 1,875 and Land Securities at 1,818.</p>

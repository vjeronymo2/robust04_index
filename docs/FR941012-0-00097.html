			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In order for the employer to demonstrate that such footwear is necessary, the employer must prove that three conditions are met: (1) that the footwear is appropriate for use in the work environment; (2) the employee's duties require him/her to work where the footwear is needed; and (3) that the use of the alternative footwear does not make the work less safe. For example, if the area where the logging is being done is moist to wet and has a dense leaf cover, the use of calk-soled boots (boots with spiked soles) would provide the logger with additional traction when walking and working on that ground cover. On the other hand, such footwear is not appropriate when a machine operator spends little time working on the ground (even if the same conditions as described above prevail) since spikes make frequent mounting and demounting of the machine more hazardous. OSHA recognizes that slips, trips and falls are a major source of injury in the logging industry, accounting for one third of the injuries to loggers (Ex. 2&hyph;1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA is also requiring that when an employee wears calk-soled logging boots, the other foot protection requirements of this paragraph must also be met. OSHA is aware that most calk-soled boots do not have steel-toes or other devices that prevent penetration by a chain saw. However, OSHA is also aware that calk-soled boots are worn primarily by fellers and buckers operating chain saws on steep terrain. Evidence in the record indicates that a vast majority of loggers in western States, where the terrain is steep, wear calk-soled boots (Ex. 2&hyph;1). However, even in those States, almost 20 percent of all injuries reported in the WIR survey involved chain saws. The vast majority of these injuries happened when the logger was struck by the chain saw. Therefore, OSHA believes that it is necessary that even when an employee wears calk-soled boots, he must also have foot protection providing protection against chain-saw penetration. As stated above, when the boot itself does not provide that protection, the employee must wear some other device that will provide the needed protection. The record shows there are such devices currently available on the market, therefore, OSHA does not believe this additional requirement will be unduly burdensome (Ex. 5&hyph;14).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Head protection.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At paragraph (d)(1)(vi) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring each employee who is at risk of injury from falling or flying objects to wear head protection. The head protection must meet the requirements of newly-revised subpart I of part 1910. Both the pulpwood logging standard and the proposed standard contained head protection requirements. The pulpwood logging standard had identified the performance criteria that head protection was required to meet, but did not specifically require employees to wear it. The proposed standard added that requirement and updated the performance criteria for the required head protection. Several State logging standards also require that employees wear head protection (Ex. 2&hyph;18, 2&hyph;19, 2&hyph;20, 2&hyph;22, 2&hyph;23, 38K).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA did not receive any comments opposing the required use of head protection and has retained the proposed provision in the final standard. OSHA believes it is important to stress that in the logging industry head protection is necessary to protect employees not only from falling objects, but also from flying objects. According to the WIR survey, 14 percent of all injuries reported were to the head (Ex. 2&hyph;1). OSHA believes this hazard is present especially for fellers, chain saw operators and persons performing chipping operations, however, there are other logging operations where the potential for head injury also exists.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Eye and face protection.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (d)(1)(vii) of the final rule requires that each employee who works in an area where there is a potential for injury due to falling or flying object shall wear eye and face protection meeting the requirements of subpart I of part 1910. This provision permits logger-type mesh screen to be worn when the employer demonstrates it provides equivalent protection. The proposed rule also contained these provisions. The 1978 ANSI standard contained a similar requirement. Eye and face protection is also required by several State logging standards (Ex. 2&hyph;18, 2&hyph;19, 2&hyph;22, 2&hyph;23, 38K).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two commenters said OSHA should require eye protection to be worn only in certain situations (Ex. 5&hyph;43 and 5&hyph;64). One commenter stated:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> This is a good rule for some logging activities, such as felling, bucking, splicing, etc.; however, we do not feel that this is necessary for choker setting and many machine operators, such as yarder, loader, feller-bunchers (Ex. 5&hyph;64).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

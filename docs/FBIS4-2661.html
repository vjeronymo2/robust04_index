			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Rain Ren] </F>   [Text] A British demand to be involved in the new Hong  Kong Special Administrative Region [SAR] passports has been  rejected by China. A Hong Kong-based senior Chinese official  told EASTERN EXPRESS that all matters relating to SAR travel  documents were within China's, "sovereign right" and were "none  of Britain's business", adding that London's demand was  "ridiculous". News of the rejection is a serious blow to the  British Joint Liaison Group team which has tried repeatedly  since last July to discuss the issue with Beijing. All  approaches have been met with silence from China.    A British official said London needed to be involved in the  process because Hong Kong was still under British rule. "In  practical terms, the passport will have to be issued in Hong  Kong," he said. "They are not going to be issued in Beijing,  "So we need to be fully involved in that activity since Hong  Kong is still under British administration."    The Chinese official said the Hong Kong Immigration  Department must "co-operate" with China in working out the  technical details of SAR passports. Matters to be sorted out  include how Hong Kong residents who qualify as permanent  residents of the SAR should apply for and take delivery of the  document. The Immigration Department will also need to develop  new technology to register passport holders and monitor the  document's use.    Beijing is still considering a design for the passport and  three options have been submitted to the Chinese government so  far.    China's Foreign Ministry will lobby other countries for  official recognition of the passport and, where applicable,  exemptions from visa requirements for passport holders. The  Chinese official said negotiations with countries over the use  of the SAR travel document would be conducted through Chinese  embassies.    The British official maintained that such matters would be  best handled on a joint basis, but he would not disclose what  role Britain wanted to play in the process saying: "We need to  reach consensus with the Chinese on who does what and when."    Hong Kong passport holders, he said, already enjoyed freedom  of travel to many countries because of previous arrangements  made by Britain. "Therefore we need to be involved in  discussions with other countries as well," he said. The British  official believed there were other complications that needed to  be resolved, including the definition of who qualifies for Hong  Kong SAR citizenship and right of abode after 1997.    A meeting of the Joint Liaison Group will be held tomorrow  to  discuss the right of abode issue. The British official said he  did not expect a breakthrough. "Other complications are that  from China's point of view, it is not easy for them to give up  their sovereign right on this issue," he said. "Having the  British or Hong Kong government involved is seen as a delegation  of their sovereignty. Our objective is to ensure ordinary  travellers in Hong Kong have the necessary documents for them to  continue to travel freely after 1997."    The European Union has said it will recognise the new SAR  passport because provisions for it were included in the Joint  Declaration.</p>

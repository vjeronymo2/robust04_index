			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: TEMPLE CITY;  </P> <P> FINAL VOTE ON HOUSE SIZES  </P> <P> The City Council on Tuesday is expected to give final approval to a modified  ordinance limiting the size of two-story homes.  </P> <P> The council last week discarded an earlier version of the ordinance, which was  a two-tiered formula based on lot size.  </P> <P> The previous draft said two-story homes on lots of 7,200 square feet or less  could have floor space totaling 50% of the lot size. Homes on larger lots could  have floor space totaling 35% of the lot size.  </P> <P> The revised ordinance does away with the two-tiered system. It requires instead  that total floor space of any two-story home not exceed 35% of the total lot  area. It also gives property owners the right to apply for an exception to the  rule through the city's conditional-use process.  </P></p>

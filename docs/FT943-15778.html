			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / International Company News: Trizec restructuring rejected Junior debtholders of Trizec, the big North American property group, yesterday voted against the company's CDollars 1.9bn (USDollars 1.36bn) financial restructuring plan. Holders of 97 per cent of the CDollars 310m of junior debt outstanding were represented at the Calgary meeting, and 66.7 per cent of those who voted rejected the plan. The rejection was widely expected since the junior debenture holders had warned they would hold out for a richer settlement. Under the restructuring, they were to get Trizec's shares plus CDollars 46m cash, but they argued this was CDollars 25m short. They may now appeal to an Alberta court to block the plan. On Tuesday senior debtholders owed CDollars 1.2bn endorsed the restructuring. They stand to get CDollars 917m cash plus Trizec shares. Following the junior debtholders' vote they may go to court today to seek permission to foreclose on their collateral. Horsham, a holding company controlled by Toronto financier Mr Peter Munk, and the US O'Connor property group would inject about CDollars 1bn cash into Trizec and take 44 per cent and 24 per cent equity control respectively. Mr Munk would be board chairman. Trizec's preferred shareholders yesterday accepted the restructuring. Common stockholders were voting later in the day. Trizec has been operating under court protection since March 19 while the restructuring was worked out and placed before debt and equity holders.</p>

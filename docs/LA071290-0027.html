			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UC SYSTEM ADMISSIONS POLICIES  </P> <P> This letter is to point out what may be a faulty assumption in Bunzel's  criticism of AB 462. He assumes that standard tests are excellent measures of  intelligence, which is questionable.  </P> <P> What they seem to measure are memorization and test-taking ability.  Unfortunately for our society, this ability does not seem to generalize to the  real world, where problems need to be solved, rather than exams passed. The  street-wise student with lower grades depicted in Paredes' case study is more  likely to have real intelligence than the other student with higher grades.  Perhaps a cultural diversity law would be a blessing in disguise for the higher  education system, jolting it into reforming its ineffective selection and  teaching practices.  </P> <P> PROF. THOMAS J. SCHEFF  </P> <P> UC Santa Barbara  </P></p>

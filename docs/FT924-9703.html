			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Allied-Lyons The new top team at Allied-Lyons is proving anything but sentimental. The decision to put Chateau Latour up for sale makes sense in strategic terms, however strong the temptation to cling on to such a proud name. The estate has never made the group much of a return. The disposal will take Allied a stage further down its chosen route of focusing on international growth brands. Together with a cash injection approaching Pounds 150m from its Carlsberg venture, the proceeds should soon make a substantial dent in group net debt of Pounds 1.9bn. Accordingly, interest cover should rise from the current level of 3.8, which is low in comparison with Grand Metropolitan and Guinness. That said, it is difficult to see the company making much of a turn on the deal. Based on the price at which it acquired the bulk of its stake from Pearson and other investors since 1988, the estate represents an investment somewhat in excess of Pounds 100m. Allied has given few details about how much the business actually earns, but it is a fair bet that it would need to conclude a sale on a multiple of between 20 and 30 to break even. It must be hoping that Axa, or whoever the final purchaser turns out to be, will not also latch on to the folly of buying brand names at unrealistic multiples simply because of their snob appeal.</p>

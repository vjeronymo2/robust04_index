The department is imposing cash penalties equivalent to the  cost of the operation that has not taken place -- though the  patient still has to be treated.    The scheme was condemned last night as nonsensical by  critics  who questioned how a hospital failing to meet government  performance criteria could be helped by punishment which further  weakened it.    David Blunkett, Labour's shadow health secretary, said: "You  couldn't get dafter if you really tried."    Under the charter, no patient should wait more than two  years  for any procedure. Since April, this limit has been cut to 18  months for cataract, hip and knee operations.    Latest official data show more than a million people in  England waiting for hospital admission at the end of June, of  whom 65,465 had been waiting more than a year -- a rise of 15.6  percent in three months.    The penalty system applies to funds distributed under the  department's waiting list programme.    This money is allocated centrally, irrespective of the  health  service market, for local health authorities to tackle long  treatment queues.    If monitoring reveals that a patient has been waiting longer  than the appropriate charter limit, the department claws back  &pound;4,000 in the case of a knee operation, &pound;3,600 for a  hip  or &pound;900 for any other procedure.    The money is taken from the regional health authority  concerned which then docks it from the relevant district  authority or the hospital concerned, depending on which is  deemed responsible for the failure.    A hospital may still be required to do the operation or the  patient may be placed elsewhere -- but, in either case, the  funding is lost.    The fines may, moreover, be increased by the regional  authority. The South West Thames region is adding a &pound;1,000  "administration fee" for every month that a patient goes over  the limit.    A hospital with a patient waiting 20 months for a knee  operation would therefore be fined &pound;6,000.    A spokeswoman for South West Thames said it had so far fined  Worthing district authority for one patient and Croydon for two,  with the penalty being passed on to Mayday hospital in the  Croydon district in at least one case.    According to the department, the scheme has been agreed by  regional managers. A spokesman said it had been well accepted as  a reasonable and effective sanction against low performers.    "The logic of it is that if they do fail on commitments the  whole of the health service has signed up to, then they know  they are going to incur the penalty," the spokesman said.    Mr. Blunkett said: "This is the kind of nonsense which  arises  from applying market forces to a caring service, which will  result in the NHS penalising those at the sharp end for failings  in the system and for under-resourcing.    "There is a danger of a spiralling downwards where financial  penalties result in further failings to achieve targets, fewer  operations and ever increasing waiting lists."</p>

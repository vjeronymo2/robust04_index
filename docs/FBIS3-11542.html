Escovar agreed that the country must make an  effort to achieve national unity but rejected the possibility of  de facto coups as hinted by the Copei leader. In Escovar's  opinion, the country wants peace and trusts the current  president.    [Begin Escovar recording] There is absolute normalcy  throughout the country. There is no destabilization risk at  this time. The people want peace and tranquility, and the  government is willing to offer it. The initiative to reach a  consensus and make commitments is a very important one.    I do not want to comment on the Copei proposal yet because  we  need to study it. I do want to say that any conciliation  proposal is welcome, because the country is hungry for national  unity. The country wants an atmosphere of national conciliation  and understanding. [end recording]    Escovar also reacted to legislators' questions regarding his  speech on state security policies. He pointed out that they  criticized its form and not its substance. The minister also  said he will give a more detailed explanation of this issue in  the future.    Meanwhile, Federal District Governor Asdrubal Aguiar  discussed the public security problem at Miraflores Palace. He  said that the prompt promulgation of a social security and  citizen safety law time is indispensable to allow the Executive  Branch to act against crime in the cities. Aguiar admitted that  although he was a critic of the Vagrancy Law, it is the sole  instrument that allows him to take actions that go beyond mere  police operations.    The governor added that in his meetings with the mayors  [prefectos] of Caracas and Vargas, he recommended that this law  be enforced without violating the right to defense and without  committing the injustices that have been regularly committed in  the enforcement of this law. As for the death toll in the  metropolitan area over the weekend, Aguiar said that even though  the figure has dropped, it is still alarming.</p>

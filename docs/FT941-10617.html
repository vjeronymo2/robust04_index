			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Court foils Fiat plans for lay-offs Fiat's hopes of being able to push through a 5 per cent reduction in its automotive workforce and lay off a further 10 per cent for two years have received a setback from the courts. A Milan court has ruled invalid a decision by Fiat to lay off for two years some 2,000 workers and 239 white collar staff at the Arese plant of Alfa Romeo near Milan. Fiat will therefore be obliged to bring these people back on to the full payroll . Unless the company can find a way round the ruling it could undermine the Turin-based car group's plans to cut labour costs and return car-making operations to profit. The ruling followed legal action by the most militant trade union grouping, Cobas, challenging the move which was put into effect three weeks ago. Arese employed 9,000 people before the restructuring plan began to be implemented and faces closure by 1996. The plant accounts for a quarter of the Fiat group's total planned lay-offs and job cuts. The court upheld Cobas's claim that the lay-offs broke an agreement between management and unions made last June. This accepted the principle that future lay-offs would not be for indeterminate periods and that laid-off workers would be able to alternate with periods of work.</p>

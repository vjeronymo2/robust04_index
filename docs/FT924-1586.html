			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Letter: Pay and experience of non-executive directors Sir, Andrew Jack's article ('New breed on the board', December 4th) bemoans the shortage of non-executive directors with marketing skills and overseas experience. Perhaps one reason is an alleged tendency to take only individuals who have served on the boards of UK publicly quoted companies. This may have merit but it excludes an important pool of experience, namely board members of UK subsidiaries of foreign multinationals. Such people are likely to have made a range of overseas contacts (and in some cases worked abroad) as part of their 'in-company' career and can be expected to bring a broader perspective to many marketing and overseas issues.

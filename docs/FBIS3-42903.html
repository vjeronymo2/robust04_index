			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Andrey Grigoryev: "Russia's Currency Market Is </F> Threatened With Paralysis"]    [Text] "A duty on transactions concerning the buying and  selling of currency" is to be introduced in Moscow as of 1  March. It is assumed that the city budget will receive 0.1  percent of the sum of all exchange currency transactions.    In the new year the capital's authorities are very actively  implementing the right granted by the presidential edict to  introduce additional territorial taxes and duties. In this case,  however, it is not quite clear who, in fact, will be the  taxpayer. It is obvious that transactions on the Moscow  Interbank Currency Exchange will become the basic taxation  object. Meanwhile, about 30 percent of the banks participating  in the currency auctions of the Moscow Interbank Currency  Exchange are not registered in Moscow and the local Moscow tax  cannot be applied to them. If the Moscow Interbank Currency  Exchange becomes the taxpayer, it will have to double the amount  of the exchange duty. (The rate of the commission collected by  the exchange now makes up the same 0.1 percent of the  transaction.) The commission of most dealer banks, which  declined significantly last year, as of today fluctuates within  0.3 to 1 percent. As a result of the introduction of the new  tax, the cost of services connected with the buying and selling  of currency will increase by 10 to 30 percent. The management of  the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange, holding consultations  with a number of exchange members, believes that this can lead,  at least temporarily, to the curtailment of exchange trade.    It is obvious that any malfunctions and pauses in the  operation of the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange, even if  they are due to purely technical reasons, lead to the  destabilization of the entire currency market and are  immediately reflected in the rate of the ruble. Thus, however  paradoxical it may seem, the new tax will have an unfavorable  effect on the entire Russian economy.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Beijing Political Situation" column by Jen Hui-wen (0117 </F> 1979 2429) written on 18 May 1994 in Beijing: "The Lack of  Coordination Between Deng Xiaoping and Chen Yun's Economic Ideas  Leaves a Legacy of Trouble"]    [Text] The Chinese mainland has adopted the largest number  of major economic restructuring programs this year. Following  the high economic growth in 1992 and 1993, this has been another  year of rapid progress. With all economic relations stretched  tightly, the inflationary pressures are unprecedented. The  situation in which two-thirds of large and medium state  enterprises operate at a loss has been increasingly serious.  The living standard of urban residents, especially the workers  and staff members of state-owned enterprises, has dropped to  some extent. Due to the problems they are experiencing in their  lives, they may set themselves against the government at any  time. Meanwhile, there is also a lack of coordination between  the central and local authorities on whether the scale of  capital construction should be reduced. Furthermore, April,  May, and June are the most sensitive months politically. The  CPC hierarchy is worried that, if the political and economic  problems unite into a single force through mutual ignition and  intensification, it will be difficult to keep the situation  under control.    Taking into account the practical situation, the Chinese  authorities have repeatedly stressed that stability is the  prerequisite of reform and development since the beginning of  this year. CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin stressed in early  April that "stability comes before everything else." [wending  yadao yiqie 4489 1353 1090 0227 0001 0434] In mid-May he again  pointed out the need to always "grasp stability as a matter of  prime importance." Hence, people cannot but feel that there may  be some unspeakable worries behind the authorities' emphasis on  stability.  <H5>  Views of the Two Party Elders on Stability Are Identical </H5>   This writer revealed on 13 May in this column that it was  Deng Xiaoping who had the patent rights for the remark that  "stability comes before everything else." According to a source  in Beijing, the patent rights for "grasping stability as a  matter of prime importance" belong to Chen Yun. During his  inspection tour of Shanghai between 26 April and 6 May, Jiang  went to Hangzhou to visit Chen Yun. After hearing Jiang's  report on the recent work, Chen gave a 12-character assessment,  meaning "a correct judgment of the current political situation  and a resolute and realistic way of doing things." Chen added:  "Over the past few years, the economy has developed, society  has been stable, and the people's livelihood has improved. All  this shows that, despite having many tasks to perform, we must  grasp stability as a matter of prime importance. Otherwise, we  shall pay a heavy price. If any country, big or small, is  unstable socially and politically, there will be turmoil. Some  political forces in the West hope for the emergence of great  chaos and peaceful evolution in China and, therefore, we should  not lower our guard."    As Chen Yun and Deng Xiaoping share identical views on  stability, the CPC hierarchy is able to carry it out more  satisfactorily. To ensure that there will be no problems in  April, May, and June, the CPC hierarchy has adopted three  measures: First, step up control over news media and propaganda.  To this end, the CPC Central Committee Propaganda Department  has especially set up a "press censorship" organ, which is  responsible for examining and analyzing the propaganda trends of  newspapers and journals at central, provincial, municipal, and  autonomous region levels and making a report to the central  Political Bureau every week. If problems detrimental to  stability are spotted, the newspapers and journals will be  banned immediately. The CPC hierarchy demands that no  statements that undermine stability be allowed to appear in  newspapers and journals, particularly during April, May, and  June. Second, tighten supervision and control over  "pro-democracy activists" and "political dissidents." It is  especially necessary to guard against these people going out  among the workers and staff members of money-losing state-owned  enterprises and taking advantage of the dissatisfaction of  unemployed workers to carry out sabotage. To this end, the CPC  hierarchy has instructed all provinces, municipalities, and  autonomous regions by cable to set up a "Leading Group for  Preventing Chaos and Dealing With Emergencies," which has been  specially tasked to handle these matters. Third, step up  ideological and political work among enterprise workers and  staff members who are having material difficulties and make good  arrangements for their livelihood to prevent the workers'  dissatisfaction from spreading into society.    Chen Yun Says There Are 10 Major Economic Problems    The source said: While stressing that stability is a matter  of prime importance, Chen Yun also talked to Jiang Zemin about  10 points for attention in economic construction, as follows:  1) In determining the speed of economic growth, we should  proceed from our national strength and guard against  "overheating"; 2) in economic construction, we should  consistently put efficiency in the first place and prevent  "excesses"; 3) in reforming state-owned enterprises, which are  the basis of the state economy, we should base ourselves on  improving, readjusting, and transforming them rather than  closing them down, suspending operations, merging them with  others, or selling them; 4) it is necessary to have an  appropriate scale of capital construction, to act in strict  accordance with planning, and to apply administrative measures  in solving the problem of capital construction getting out of  control; 5) the CPC Central Committee and the State Council  should curb the practice of getting credits or calling loans in  violation of the regulations or through personal notes, which is  still fairly serious, and deal with cadres who violate the  regulations; 6) it is necessary to keep inflation under control  and create a situation of a low inflation rate and a fairly high  economic growth, which has Chinese characteristics; 7) as the  center of the state's economy and finance, the taxation system  should be improved and strictly enforced, and the law should be  applied to plug up loopholes and crack down on violations; 8) it  is necessary to pay attention to unemployment and work stoppages  and to make job placement a routine official business, and there  should be medium- and long-term planning for job placement; 9)  we should emphasize doing a good job in agricultural production,  communications facilities, energy development, and residential  housing; and 10) we should sum up the craze in real estate,  stock market, and securities speculation and draw up legislation  and regulations to properly solve these problems rather than let  the situation become anarchy, which will adversely tarnish the  state's reputation and causes confusion in people's minds.  <H5>  What Is the Difference Between the Economic Concepts of Deng </H5> Xiaoping and Chen Yun?    An economist in Beijing pointed out: The guiding idea of  Chen Yun's 10-point view on economic construction is basically  the same as that of his talk during the Spring Festival. Both  are based on "stability," but it is different from what Deng  Xiaoping advocates. Take as an example their talks in Shanghai  during the Spring Festival. Deng praised Shanghai's good and  rapid development, saying that Shanghai must speedily bring into  play its role as a "locomotive" in promoting China's rapid  economic growth, and he again stressed Shanghai's important  strategic position in promoting China's economic development.  Chen, however, stressed his consistent idea, namely, "the scale  and speed of construction must be suited to national strength"  and "it is necessary to strengthen the central authority and  concentrate all energy on handling major issues."    To be specific, Deng Xiaoping stresses the decentralization  of power, maintaining that regional economic development (such  as Shanghai) has a more important role in the overall situation;  Chen Yun, however, lays stress on centralization of power,  holding that the strengthening of central authority plays the  most fundamental role in the overall situation. Deng holds that  "development is the last word," that a basic balance of speed,  scale, and national strength can be attained in the course of  seeking development, and that this is more compatible with the  objective law than the practice of defining first a "national  strength criterion" and then the development of scale and speed.  Chen, however, holds that it is of the greatest importance to  first define a "national strength criterion" and that only by  keeping development scale and speed in a predefined range can we  genuinely act according to the objective law and ensure the  healthy growth of the economy. Deng maintains that the market  economy enables limited resources to be most efficiently  developed and that the market economic structure is the basis  for explaining "why economic scale and speed frequently exceed  the predetermined range." Chen, however, regards the market  economic factor as a limited supplementary factor to the planned  economic structure rather than an economic means that can play  an objective function to the economic situation as a whole.    The economist stressed: The lack of coordination between  Deng Xiaoping's and Chen Yun's economic ideas is one reason why  the CPC hierarchy has been vacillating on the major issue of  handling the relationship between reform and development. The  CPC hierarchy is trying to strike a balance between the  different economic views of the two party elders. There are  indications that Chen's view is more readily acceptable to the  hierarchy, while Deng's view is more readily acceptable to the  local authorities. This is also an important reason why there  are often contradictions between the central and local  authorities.</p>

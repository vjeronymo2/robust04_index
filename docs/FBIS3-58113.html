			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Francoise Crouigneau: "Alexandre Lamfalussy: An </F> Economist Fascinated by Public Service"]    [Text] Independent spirit but profoundly  consensual.    Extremely courteous but capable, with his soft and precise  voice, of driving home his technical points in discussions with  students, ministers, or central bank governors. Alexandre  Lamfalussy, the first president of the European Monetary  Tnstitute (EMI), masks his passions and his horror of extremes  with a talent nearly void of nuance. But one should not be  mistaken. Although this 64-year-old Belgian of Hungarian origins  has proven his sharp sense of compromise, he will still be a  rigorous and demanding interlocutor for EU central bankers as  well as ministers of economy and finance. Elected unanimously  for contradictory reasons--some expect a low profile from him,  others an activism allowing the fluid powers granted the EMT  under the Maastricht Treaty to be reinforced--he will not let  his actions be dictated. And will remain faithful to the triple  credo which marked his unorthodox professional life: a  fascination for public service, a deep European character, and  an attachment to economic theory when it constitutes a simple  tool of action.  <H5>  Looking For Innovations </H5>   His expression alternately one of concentration or  mischieviousness under a high forehead encircled with white  hair, Alexandre Lamfalussy knows that he does not have too rich  an experience with which to approach his new tasks. The son of  an engineer who worked for the Water and Forestry Service,  Lamfalussy's European roots date from his college years spent  with the Benedictines in close association with the prestigious  Belgian University of Louvain. Skeptical of the seriousness of  political sciences, he opted in 1947 for "the appearance of  rigor" which he found in the economic sciences when he entered  the Polytechnical University of Budapest.    Soon aware that his instruction there was becoming more and  more Marxist, that the iron curtain which Stalin erected was  ending the democratic reconstruction of Hungary, he fled his  country in 1949 without hope of returning. With $10 for his  entire trip, he arrived in Vienna with three friends and took  part in that city's bad days, the days of the "Third Man"  symbolized by Orson Welles. He then went to Belgium and the  University of Louvain where he followed a course in which his  economic research and his teaching never ceased to mingle with  his banking and public official duties, both mutually enriching.    "Investment and Growth in Advanced Economies: The Belgian  Case" was the theme of the doctorate presented in 1957 by the  young Lamfalussy at Oxford--a university less doctrinaire than  Cambridge--and was the first illustration of his constant desire  to link theory with concrete reality. Working at the Bank of  Brussels, he discovered the interaction between the financial  sector and the real economy.    Looking for something new, he was involved from the start  when the Bank of Brussels participated in the first issue of  Eurobonds ever launched. This was in 1963. And while today $15  million raised for the Italian "autostrada" elicits a smile, at  the time this sort of operation--imagined by Warburg--was a true  revolution. "The Financial Markets in Europe," which he  published in 1968, bears the mark of this event. As does the  year he spent at Yale in the early 1960's as a lecturer, at the  invitation of Robert Triffin--also a Belgian, whose background  seriously influenced him: He predicted the scuttling of the  Bretton Woods international monetary system and then denounced  the dysfunctional floating exchange rate system, before  forecasting the creation of a European Monetary System and the  promotion of the ECU to challenge the domination of the dollar.  <H5>  At the Head of BIS in 1985 </H5>   Having become a banker and renowned university professor,  Alexandre Lamfalussy did not avoid painful experiences. Kingpin  of the merger which gave birth to the Brussels Lambert Bank, he  discovered, at his own expense, the evils of monetary  speculation. If he did not feel himself directly implicated in  the enormous loss of foreign exchange incurred by the Bank of  Brussels, he nonetheless assumed responsibility for it and  declined the presidency of the board of Brussels Lambert in  1975. His heart was no longer in it. And when he was offered the  position as the head of the monetary department of the Bank for  International Settlements (BIS) in 1976, he turned a new page of  his professional life without regret.    Moving to Basel did not cut him totally out of the  University  of Louvain where he continued to teach until he entered the  upper management ranks of BIS. He considered his contact with  students a veritable mental health necessity in order not to be  engulfed by the "central bank culture" where the priority given  to a healthy management was rarely on a par with that given to  hardly-orthodox and less-than-visionary ideas. But, since 1985  and his arrival at the head of the BIS--this revolving door for  central banks which also insures some of their financial  operations--no major financial or monetary issue has escaped him.    Hailed as much for his management as for his legendary  discretion by central bankers to whom he reported during the  past eight years, Lamfalussy, who now outranks these bankers as  president of the EMI, will play a discrete but decisive role in  the years to come. This role will be played out in the difficult  analysis of issues such as the globalization of the financial  system, the poorly defined explosion of hedging that now drives  the derivative products market, and especially the progress  toward Economic and Monetary Union.    A member of the Delors Committee which provided the monetary  basis of the Maastricht Treaty, Alexandre Lamfalussy knows all  the problems of trying to establish a single currency, an effort  which seems to him indispensable for the future of Europe. He  knows the political potholes which are waiting and the  reticences of central bankers who intend to retain all their  prerogatives. He also knows the total commitment and  imagination it takes to create a new tool, the EMU, which is  supposed to turn itself into a European Central Bank. In effect,  he will have to establish coordinating mechanisms such as a  credible method to oversee the Twelve's monetary and  macroeconomic policies. A delicate task since recessionary fears  and the constraints of national and European elections may push  certain governments to relax their vigilance. One can count on  Alexandre Lamfalussy to take them to task, publicly if  necessary. But can he succeed in asserting himself in the face  of European heavy weights? He, who was among the first to be  stigmatized by the excess of Thatcherism or who once discretely  denounced the stubborness of the Bundesbank?    Although he is known to have been chosen for this position  because of his freedom of thought and his capacity to not abuse  it, his authority comes from the quiet recognition that, not  having been candidate for the presidency of the EMI, he has  nothing to lose. And if the chemistry of this institution does  not take hold, or it displeases him, he will take pleasure in  again finding his place at the university, in writing, and in  enjoying the home he inherited on the shores of Lake Balaton in  Hungary where he produces a famous wine. And these solitary  pleasures have for a long time been the source from which he  yearly replenishes himself.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Emanuel Neri] </F>   [Excerpt] Fernando Henrique Cardoso has chosen Deputy Jose  Serra (PSDB-SP) [Brazilian Social Democracy Party-Sao Paulo  State] to coordinate the drafting of his government program.    Cardoso has also chosen former Deputy Euclides Scalco  (Parana  State) as the national coordinator of his electoral campaign.  Scalco will in turn designate the respective regional  coordinators.    The program will be completed by 21 May when the PSDB  national convention will officially nominate Cardoso as its  presidential candidate. Serra will be assisted by a team of  aides.    Serra, who is expected to seek a Senate seat for Sao Paulo  State, is considered to be one of Cardoso's closest and most  influential friends. If Cardoso is elected president, Serra is  likely to become his finance minister.    Serra understands Cardoso's political thinking better than  anyone else. Their relations are often marked by disagreement  and tension. In addition to drafting the government program,  Serra will serve as a type of permanent adviser to Cardoso.    Scalco's appointment seeks to assuage the wrath of the  leftist wing of the PSDB over the alliance that has been almost  concluded with the PFL [Liberal Front Party] and over the  virtual choice of Deputy Luiz Eduardo Magalhaes -- son a former  Bahia Governor Antonio Carlos Magalhaes -- as Cardoso's running  mate.    Scalco has always been identified with the left wing of the  PSDB. His first task will be to confer with the PSDB blocs that  oppose a coalition with the PFL. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Strong debuts The day's two newcomers to the stock market, Hambros Insurance Services Group and Quality Software Products, put on very creditable first-day showings. The former was the market's third most heavily traded stock with some 15m shares changing hands. The shares, oversubscribed almost four times, opened at 146p, an 8p premium to the offer price of 138p, and moved in a relatively narrow range to close at 144p. The shares attracted applications from 93 independent intermediaries - stockbrokers or financial advisers - more than double the previous record for any flotation. Quality Software quickly surged ahead to reach 537p, the eventual closing level, for a premium of 41 per cent on the 380p issue price. Turnover was 1.3m shares.</p>

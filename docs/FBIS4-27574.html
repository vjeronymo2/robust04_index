			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Kim Song-yong from Hong Kong] </F>   [Text] It was confirmed on 27 May that North Korea has yet  to withdraw U.S. $3.3 million of the $10 million it deposited in  the Hong Kong branch of the Arab bank BCCI [Bank of Credit and  Commerce International] that went bankrupt in 1991. North Korea  deposited $10 million in the BCCI's Hong Kong branch in the name  of the Korea Light Industry Commission in 1990. However, it has  only withdrawn $6.7 million from the bank since the BCCI  headquarters went bankrupt in July 1991, and is now waiting for  the bank's settlement to pay $3.3 million, the remainder of its  deposit.</p>

			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / International Company News: Soft prices push SCA into 42% retreat SVENSKA Cellulosa (SCA), Sweden's second biggest pulp and paper group, suffered a 42 per cent drop in profits after financial items to SKr1.23bn (Dollars 204m) last year, compared with SKr2.13bn in 1990. Group sales rose by 5.2 per cent to SKr32.76bn. Earnings per share fell by 27 per cent to SKr5.27, and the group proposed keeping the dividend unchanged at SKr3.2. SCA blamed the sharp drop in profits on its high financial charges and the decline in prices for most of its paper products during the latter part of 1991. The group has pursued an aggressive expansion programme which included the acquisition of Reedpack, the UK paper, packaging and office supplies group, for Pounds 1.05bn in 1990. However, high interest rates have pushed up the cost of acquisitions, and SCA's net financial expenses jumped 52 per cent to SKr1.42bn in 1991, mainly due to the Reedpack takeover's cost. Operating profits fell in three of SCA's divisions - packaging, graphic paper, and forest and timber. However, the group's largest business area - the hygiene products division which makes babies' nappies - showed a 20.7 per cent increase in operating profit to SKr727m, on slightly lower sales of SKr11.628bn. While profits in this area increased due to the implementation of a rationalisation programme, SCA said tougher price competition had limited the improvement.</p>

			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANTIQUES: AROUND HOME;  </P> <P> PUEBLO POTTERY  </P> <P> THE PUEBLO artists of the American Southwest have created ceramics that, in  form and design, compare favorably with pottery made in more sophisticated  parts of the world. These artists functioned -- and still function -- without  the aid of a potter's wheel.  </P> <P> The Indians who have occupied pueblos in Arizona and New Mexico for nearly  2,000 years were the first North Americans to create true pottery. Best-known  of the pueblos are those of the Hopi in Arizona and, in New Mexico, those of  the Zuni, Acoma, Laguna, Santa Clara and San Ildefonso Indians. Pottery  techniques were passed from older to younger women, although occasionally men  were involved in the process.  </P> <P> Primitive techniques have resulted in the loveliest and most sophisticated  creations. Moist clay is coiled to form the desired shape of the pottery, and  the coils are pinched together to form a rough outline of the piece. Hands and  fingers dipped in water further shape the vessel, which is then scraped by the  rind of a gourd, sun-dried and sanded with a sandstone. Then a mirror-like  finish is produced by careful polishing of the vessel with a small, oval  pebble. Paint is applied with a strip of yucca leaf that has been drawn through  the potter's teeth several times to create the proper shape. (A mystical  significance surrounds the craft, because, in the eyes of Pueblo Indians, color  is the gift of the gods.) The final firing takes place in an excavated basin or  kiln in the ground, and the dried clay vessels are placed on supports such as  rocks and potsherds and heated to between 600 and 900 degrees centigrade.  </P> <P> Excellent pottery is made today in the Hopi pueblos, especially in some of the  villages of First Mesa. The pueblos of San Ildefonso, Santa Clara and San Juan,  in the northwestern Rio Grande Valley, are also centers of fine ceramic  production. Take for example a typical Hopi polychrome jar with designs of  opposed "bird wing" motifs adapted from ancient models; a Zuni polychrome with  arabesque motifs and a naturalistic deer showing Apache or Navajo influence, or  an Acoma polychrome with multiple paneled bands repeating naturalistic bird  figures.  </P> <P> Most popular of all is the black ware. For 100 years, one of the centers for  polished black ware was Santa Clara, where highly polished wedding vases with  double necks and bear-paw motifs were common. San Ildefonso was equally  renowned, especially for the elegant matte-black-on-burnished-black vessels,  perfected by such famous artists as the late Maria Martinez, who rediscovered  early black-ware firing techniques in the 1920s. Sleekly contemporary in both  concept and execution, black ware fits well with many of today's design  imperatives.  </P> <P>  Pueblo pottery is available at the Silver Man Gallery West in Los Angeles;  Federico, Wounded Knee Gallery and Nonesuch Gallery in Santa Monica; White Eyes  Indian Shop in Arcadia; Indian Art Center of California in Studio City;  Caskey-Lees Gallery (by appointment only) in Topanga Canyon; Don Bennett and  Associates (by appointment only) in Westlake Village; Ojai Indian Shop in Ojai;  Galeria Capistrano in San Juan Capistrano, and American Indian Store in San  Diego.  </P></p>

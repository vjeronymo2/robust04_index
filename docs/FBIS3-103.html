			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Nazaire Breka] </F>   [Excerpt] A joint Franco-Ivorian military exercise  codenamed "N'Zi 94" will take place from 28 February to 4 March  in the Gagnoa, Sinfra, Bocanda, and Bongouanou quadrilateral  area. "N'Zi 94" will therefore be the first major military  maneuver undertaken by the Ivorian Army in 10 years.    Franco-Ivorian maneuvers were suspended for essentially  economic reasons. This year, the Ministry of Defense and the  military general staff have decided to organize, in conjunction  with the French, a joint exercise which will mobilize over 1,200  men, 250 light vehicles and tanks, 10 combat planes, and three  naval ships. Because of the economic crisis, France will make a  substantial contribution to the success of the operation. It  will bear the cost of fuel, ammunition, and food rations.  [passage omitted]</p>

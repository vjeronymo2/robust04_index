			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ...AS BUSH'S VISION DIMS;  </P> <P> ELECTIONS: IT WASN'T ABORTION THAT SUNK THE GOP. IT WAS THE FAILURE OF GOP  LEADERS TO OFFER A VISION.  </P> <P> Tuesday's "off year" election was not a referendum on abortion, race or any  other single issue. It was a referendum on vision -- and Republicans were  defeated all over the country because they have lost theirs.  </P> <P> Republican inability to read the political eye chart was revealed by the  party's leader at his Tuesday news conference. Speaking on the abortion issue  (though the subject could as easily have been capital gains taxes), President  Bush, who had made some gains among conservatives for what they had perceived  as a principled pro-life stand, said, "We have room in our party for people  that feel one way, pro-life or pro-choice. The Democratic Party is the same  way."  </P> <P> The Democratic Party is not the same way. Few staunchly pro-life Democrats  could be elected to anything above the level of dog catcher, and no one could  hope to be nominated for President in the Democratic Party if he or she is not  convincingly pro-choice.  </P> <P> This is what is killing Republicans from coast to coast. Voters don't want  accommodaters. They want leaders with strong convictions who will tell them  what is right and wrong and why. They want visionaries who will lead them  toward a defined goal.  </P> <P> During last year's election campaign, President Bush didn't say that there was  room in the Republican Party for those who thought Willie Horton ought to be  out on parole, or room for flag burners along with those who would protect the  national symbol. He took a stand. He had a vision. And the people followed.  </P> <P> Now he complains that Congress is "blocking everything I try to do." And why  shouldn't they? The "Mr. Nice Guy" image may work at country clubs, but it is  suicide in politics. At a prize fight the biggest cheers don't come when the  combatants shake hands before the fight, but when the slugging starts.  </P> <P> There is only one reason for winning the presidency and it has nothing to do  with promoting kindness and gentleness. It has to do with exercising power to  promote the general welfare.  </P> <P> In order to promote the general welfare, though, one must define the general  welfare. It does not excite conservative voters, who provided President Bush  with his margin of victory, when they hear him say that abortion, for example,  is not the most important issue "for me . . . absolutely not." There is only  one reason to oppose abortion and that is because one believes it is the taking  of innocent human life.  </P> <P> If President Bush can't get worked up over the most emotional issue our society  faces, what issue will light a fire under him?  </P> <P> Rep. Jim Courter lost support early on in the New Jersey governor's race  because he tried to accommodate the pro-choicers by softening his pro-life  position. Pro-choicers already had one of their own in Rep. James Florio, so  why should they vote for Courter? They didn't and neither did many pro-lifers,  who stayed home and watched Courter lose by a 2-1 margin.  </P> <P> In Virginia, though the margin was tight, Marshall Coleman assured voters that  if elected governor he would not do anything to change the abortion status quo.  </P> <P> This is not the kind of talk that energizes conservatives to go out and vote,  and it is not the kind of talk that will produce victories for Republicans.  </P> <P> Republicans have a case of political cataracts. If they don't have them  removed, they risk going blind and having to be led around by Democrats.  </P></p>

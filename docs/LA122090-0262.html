			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> JOEL ADMITS HE TRIED SUICIDE  </P> <P> Singer-songwriter Billy Joel, who was honored recently as one of four music  legends of the past two decades, has revealed that he attempted to end his life  not once, but twice, at the age of 20 or 21.  </P> <P> "I felt the last thing the world needed was another failed itinerant musician,  so I popped a bunch of pills," Joel told Parade magazine.  </P> <P> "It didn't work, so I tried again by swallowing furniture polish.  </P> <P> "Again, it wasn't fatal, but I checked into the hospital. . . . It was the best  thing I ever did. I stayed there three weeks and saw all these people with  profound emotional and mental problems. It was a great insight, because I  realized my situation was nothing compared to theirs. I knew I'd never feel  that sorry for myself again."  </P></p>

			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Letter: Safety and security issues no argument against gas competition Sir, Mr Cedric Brown of British Gas (Letters, June 30) is right to say that there must be no compromise on the issue of safety and security of supply in introducing fair competition into the domestic gas market. However, these important issues should not be used as an argument to block the introduction of competition, but rather to frame necessary high standards of service to which those companies wishing to supply the domestic consumer must adhere. In submissions to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission by ourselves and several associated energy utilities we also stressed the need for safety and security of supply. We advocated retaining a single transportation company and a separate storage company. This combination would permit clear and transparent charging of services to all users, including British Gas's marketing operations. It would also facilitate the maintenance of the same standards of safety and security of supply as customers currently enjoy. We stand by our belief that the new domestic gas suppliers should be allowed to compete on a fair and equal basis with British Gas and must be prepared to share fully in the social obligations that the Gas Act currently vests solely with British Gas. Further, the creation of a new and comprehensive public gas supplier licence will lay to rest once and for all British Gas's arguments over independents 'cherry picking' more lucrative customers and effectively ignoring the needs of the socially disadvantaged. We do not disagree with Ruth Evans of the National Consumer Council (Letters, July 1) that competition must prove its worth before regulation can be relaxed; indeed we espouse the phased introduction of competition in the domestic market to ensure that consumer interests are fully respected. The introduction of competition into other privatised monopolies has brought benefits in both price and standards of service to domestic consumers. In the case of gas, British Gas admits that, of the 25,000 firm industrial/commercial contract gas users now able to enjoy competition, more than 50 per cent have chosen to leave British Gas in favour of competitive supply. How long must the 18m UK domestic gas customers wait before they can enjoy the same freedom of choice? Peter J Bryant, deputy chairman, Utilicorp UK, 21 Tothill Street, London SW1</p>

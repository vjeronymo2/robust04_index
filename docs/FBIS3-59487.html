			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Kazimierz Dziewanowski, former Polish ambassador </F> to the United States: "A Change of Guard or the Guardhouse"]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] The editors asked a question  that quite a few people are asking these days: How did the  victory of the postcommunists in the September elections happen?  It is good that they asked, and it is good that such discussion  is under way. This discussion is not hair-splitting or a barren  exercise compounding the sense of disaster, as we may think at  times when feeling discouraged. Nations that shun, fear, or feel  ashamed of the truth about their own mistakes often pay a high  price later. As is known, he who does not learn from his  mistakes is condemned to repeat them. Even worse, societies that  look for explanations of their mistakes without trying to  analyze them and pinpoint their actual causes rely on fabricated  explanations, or, in other words, they construct myths because  they fear hard truths. That is why such discussions and  confrontation with the past are needed, are even indispensable,  unpleasant as they may be.  <H5>  How Did It Happen and What Happened? </H5>   To answer this question with some exactitude, we first have  to determine more closely just what happened.    Well, first of all, in 1989 power was taken from the  communists. Besides, some people say--not without being somewhat  right--that it was the communists themselves who yielded power.  And, indeed, in 1989 they did not try to hold on to power by  resorting to force; instead, they sat down (on their own  initiative) at the "roundtable." But that is only part of the  truth because it happened only in 1989, after resorting to force  no longer had the chance of succeeding. Previously, in clinging  to power, which they had seized by precisely an alien [Soviet]  and not their own force, the communists had repeatedly, or  rather continually, been resorting to force. They did so in the  years 1945-54, and in an exceptionally frightful manner at that.  They also did so during the Poznan [bread riots] in 1956, in  Warsaw and other cities in 1968, in 1970 [workers' massacre] on  the coast, in 1976 in Radom, at Ursus [Tractor Plant] and  elsewhere, and last--again on a large scale--in 1981 [martial  law imposed] (and during several subsequent years) throughout  the country. It thus cannot be said that avoiding to resort to  force and sitting down at the "roundtable" used to be a favorite  custom of communists.  <H3>  The First Time They Avoided Force and Resorted to the  "Roundtable" They Lost Power </H3>   That took place in an atmosphere of enthusiasm and elation.  Some people compared that event to the atmosphere and emotional  tension associated with great Polish national uprisings. But  that was not so, considering that the transfer of power took  place in the absence of violence and victims and thus led to  various distinctive consequences--good, admirable, and  praiseworthy ones, but also some less admirable. But inasmuch as  the "roundtable" nature of that transfer has already been the  subject of numerous discussions, accusations, insinuations, and  demagogic utterances, anyone who discusses it should at the same  time define his position on it so as to avoid misunderstandings.  As for myself, I believe that the decision of the democratic  opposition in those times to sit down with the communists at the  roundtable was correct and definitely more justifiable than a  boycott.    As a result, the communists lost power, and this happened in  the absence of bloodshed. This was followed by a four-year reign  of the then opposition, which became the ruling group, to its  own great amazement and astonishment.    That period is now over, and it is time to sum it up  briefly.  Of course, I am aware that a penetrating assessment would be  premature; besides, many of the related matters are still  incomplete, and the last cards have not been dealt yet, nor is  the last act of the drama over. Still, a definite era in history  is certainly over.    In view of the customs that during that period became  widespread in public life, in view of the flood of false  accusations, slanders, and reproaches lacking even a modicum of  truth, several fundamental things must be said before evaluating  that period.    The then democratic opposition took on the burden of  responsibility for the country without being properly prepared  for it. That happened not so much through its fault as chiefly  through the fault of those who had relinquished power on seeing  that they could no longer wield it (and they deserve praise for  becoming aware of it). Here several obvious things, little if at  all known to the present-day voter, should be pointed out. Well,  the essence of the communist system consisted precisely in that  all important documents, facts, statistics, and information  concerning the state were secret and not accessible to the  opposition, and attempts to gain access to them, if only in  order to understand better the surrounding reality and to  consider the future, were punished and viewed as hostile  antistate activities. Attempts to learn about such domains as  national defense, foreign policy, domestic security, the actual  budget and state expenditures, or even about true figures on the  state of public opinion (insofar as they were at all known)  meant immediate imprisonment or something even worse. Then, too,  consider that all of the higher posts and sometimes even entire  professions and kinds of work had been reserved exclusively for  members of the ruling party, and, in the case of particularly  sensitive occupations, for especially trusted functionaries,  whom Orwell termed members of the "inner party." I am not  referring here solely to the diplomatic service or the General  Staff. Eighty-odd percent of village chairmen in Poland used to  belong to the party....  <H5>  Waiting Would Have Been Impossible </H5>   Independent thinking about the system of society, foreign  policy, national defense, the direction of economic policy, and  political alliances had been permitted by only a handful of  privileged individuals within the party. If nonparty members  tried to engage in such thinking, they were ridiculed, their  sanity was questioned, and they were accused of being morally  disqualified, of "politicking," sowing discord, displaying  overweening ambition, and being irresponsible. Their attempts  were unethical and suspicious, or at least that was how they  were depicted.    As a result, in accepting responsibility for the government,  the members of the then democratic opposition faced an  incomparably more difficult task than the previous rulers, who  had anyhow failed to cope with it and thus brought about  economic collapse and hyperinflation, turning this country into  a major international debtor.    Given its insufficient preparation, should the opposition  have accepted responsibility for governing, or should it rather  have shunned it and waited? Wait for what? Wait until the  country is drowned in chaos, until inflation is growing at a  rate of several hundred percent daily, until blood is shed? By  then it was perfectly obvious that the communists were incapable  of ruling and that a continuation of the existing situation  would result in disaster. It has to be honestly admitted that  the then leadership of the PZPR [Polish United Workers Party]  probably was aware of this problem and drew its own conclusions.  It was also understood by the individuals heading (or rather  creating the leadership of) the democratic opposition, who  engaged in intense internal disputes, because experience had  taught them to distrust the communists. After all, Poland was  the first country to enter upon this new road; at the time, the  USSR had not yet disintegrated, the Warsaw Pact was still  operational, and the Berlin Wall still stood intact and guarded.  Friends of the PZPR, such as Honecker, Ceausescu, Zhivkov, and  others, were still in power at the time. The Polish opposition  was aware that they were likely to oppose it, by force....    Really, people who claim nowadays that they had known from  the beginning that there should have been no negotiations or  compromises with the communists are wise after the fact; at the  time they were silent.    Upon taking over the government, the members of the former  opposition succeeded within a couple of months in introducing a  set of economic, financial, and social measures that served to  halt inflation. Further, they commenced the indispensable and as  yet uncompleted process of privatization, made the zloty  convertible, strengthened the currency, filled store shelves,  and assured Poland of fuel and energy independence. Nowadays,  when we consider the East and the situation of certain countries  of the former USSR, we can see what Poland would have been like  had these reforms not been accomplished. Those individuals who  are making such outcries about Polish sovereignty should  consider what the situation would have been like had we not  afforded to this country, for example, additional possibilities  for securing supplies of crude petroleum and gasoline. After  all, it was not so long ago that farmers used to wait for days  in line in front of gasoline stations and turn their farms into  unsafe, flammable petroleum-storage areas.    In addition, during those first few years of the new  government, a major reduction of foreign debt could be  accomplished. Note incidentally that, during the recent  electoral campaign, a "responsible" politician uttered on  television some nonsense about truck convoys carrying $2 billion  in government funds each week from Poland to Switzerland. His  knowledge of the reality is such that he believes that  substantial funds are carried nowadays in trucks, but, more to  the point, consider that $2 billion weekly means $104 billion  annually. Polish exports have never so far exceeded $15 billion  a year. Therefore, $104 billion sounds like black magic. Should  any Polish government succeed in thus multiplying dollars, it  should stay in power forever. At any rate, a man who believes  that money is carried to Switzerland in trucks should not be  elected; after all, everyone knows that it is carried there in  socks.    But let us return to reality from Cockaigne. It is a fact  that Solidarity governments have brought about a 50-percent  reduction of Polish debt in the so-called Club of Paris--that  is, more than $20 billion. They also concluded a highly  satisfactory agreement with united Germany, established amicable  relations with all of the neighboring countries, and brought  about the withdrawal of Russian troops from Poland.    In speaking of Solidarity governments, I mean not only  particular cabinets but also the Belweder and the entire system  of society established during those four years because a no less  important accomplishment of those four years has been the laying  of the foundations of parliamentary democracy based on the rule  of law, even if it is not too popular nowadays and has deserved  considerable criticism. That will be discussed hereafter. But  there is not the slightest doubt that the existence of an even  not too efficient parliamentary system is ever so much better  than the lack of any such system.    Also established were mass media that are, though  experiencing a number of ailments (chiefly childhood ailments),  moderately independent and operate in the absence of censorship;  they may be making many mistakes, but they represent a fairly  effective means of social control over the government and the  bureaucracy.    All this has happened during those four years and by now  taken sufficient root to make possible a fairly efficient (and  so far proceeding without any major shock) transfer of power to  the new governing team.    Here we arrive at the core of our reflections.    Montaigne wrote in his "Twenty-Third Essay," "Those who try  to topple the government are most often the first to fall,  crushed under its ruins; the fruit of unrest is rarely harvested  by its initiator; usually the water is thus muddied and stirred  for the benefit of other fishermen" (in Boy-Zelenski's  translation). And Bernard Shaw wrote that revolutionary  movements attract the best and the worst elements of society.  <H5>  Was It a Revolution? </H5>   The fact that not a shot was fired and no window broken,  that  the Bastille was not demolished, and that no one was immured in  it, might conflict with the idea of a revolution. On the other  hand, the fact that an entire class or, rather, a large social  group--the party nomenklatura may not have been a  class according to classical definitions but certainly was a  very large and influential group and perhaps also something  more--was rather suddenly deprived of influence and largely  replaced may indicate that all this was something of a  revolution, considering also that the prolonged [communist] era  of nearly total stagnation was superseded by a period of great  social, occupational, etc. mobility. But it is not important  what we call it, a revolution or whatever. I am engaging in  these reflections only to justify the reference to Shaw's highly  significant dictum and also to mention Cocteau's sober and  skeptical remark, "The purity of a revolution may at most last  two weeks."    In our Polish case, that lasted somewhat longer, but not by  much. Soon afterward, in addition to the lack of preparation,  there appeared selfishness, greed, lack of moderation and often  also of decency, corruption and abuse of power, and, in the end,  the craving to amass money rapidly. All of this soon surfaced,  sometimes in the form of a caricature, as when family affairs  were settled with the aid of the public prosecutor's offices,  and sometimes in a more threatening form, as when public affairs  were resolved with the aid of secret documents. In addition, the  poor quality of a large segment of the new political class--I  hesitate to use the term "elite"--has become clear. For God's  sake, what kind of elites are they, considering that they are  ignorant of the surrounding world, cannot foresee elementary  consequences of their actions, and cannot correlate elementary  facts. But still? According to Slownik Wyrazow Obcych  [Dictionary of Foreign Terms], published by the PWN Press,  an elite is "a group or assemblage of persons displaying some  distinguishing characteristic." It is not unlikely that the last  Sejm did indeed consist of people displaying some distinguishing  characteristic, but I am not going to define it.  <H5>  The Composition of the New Political Class Proved Weak </H5>   The astonishing stupidity of the Right has already been  widely discussed in print, so there is no need for me to  describe it. The trouble is that this concerns parties,  movements, and fringe parties that had attracted 20 percent of  the vote but, at present, are not represented in the parliament  [because none of these parties won at least 5 percent of the  national vote]. But, of course, the point is not just the feeble  intellectual qualifications of certain activists--I hesitate to  call them politicians. For there also are the numerous hasty  decisions made by such a serious, experienced, and merited  institution as the Roman Catholic Church. It behaved to some  extent as if it was bereft of the experience of 20 centuries or  of the 20th century.    The unpreparedness and immaturity of the Solidarity forces  were reflected in, among other things, their failure--and that  was a grave shortcoming--to explain to the public, carefully and  clearly, their goals and intentions; even though they had a  program of action, they were unable to make it sufficiently  detailed and convincing.    Trusting too much in their authority, their mission, and  their historical rationale, the Solidarity forces neglected to  consider what democratic politicians must always keep in  mind--namely, that the principal yardstick of a politician's  effectiveness is not whether history declares him to be right  but whether voters declare him to be so, and in the very next  election, at that. The "war at the top" and the destructive and  sometimes shameful nature of successive electoral campaigns  dealt a heavy blow to such an approach by Solidarity.  <H5>  What Then Did Happen? </H5>   There was a change of guard but, by then, in a new  guardhouse, in which different rules apply. It may be that the  new sentinels will adapt themselves to the altered  environment--and then this change will benefit Polish democracy.  It would be beneficial if all of the main political forces in  Poland were to share in succession responsibility for carrying  out the reforms needed to have Poland enter the 21st century as  an equal partner of other European countries rather than as an  island of backwardness. That will be a long and difficult social  process, which is not surprising because changes on such a scale  and in such depth are bound to last much longer than was  expected in the beginning. In order that the creation of a  genuine and efficient democracy, that sole system of society  assuring social and economic progress, may be crowned with  success, it is also necessary for voters to realize that no one  can work miracles in politics or the economy, that manna does  not fall from the sky and plums do not fall from trees into  mouths. Should this happen, perhaps a stable and responsible  parliamentary democracy, meaning something different from a  system under which some people try to carry out needed changes  (and, in the process, make mistakes, which is natural) while  others merely criticize them and promise a rose garden, will  finally begin to operate in Poland.    But, of course, the outcome may also be different. If the  new  government discontinues the reforms or, in the event of some  crisis or under the pressure of the electorate, protects its  position at the expense of a loss of currency stability and  economic progress, if it fences off Poland with barriers of  customs duties and prohibitions, and if it smothers private  enterprise with taxes, then the opportunity will be forfeited,  and, after some time, we shall again face a major economic,  social, and political crisis.    Summing up, what happened happened, and it cannot be undone.  But the consequences may vary, and I believe that they still  cannot be prejudged. The basic problem is that all of those  shocks and twists and turns in our country are part of a much  broader, worldwide great crisis of leadership, which nowadays  can be observed in practically every country in the world. No  continent has been bypassed by that crisis. But that is a  subject for separate reflection.    Nowadays, ours is not the only country in which,  chameleonlike, power keeps changing its shape and hues while  perching on a swaying and weak branch. A reason for optimism is  that this creature does not, insofar as we know, behave  irrationally.</p>

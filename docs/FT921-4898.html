			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Companies face claims on leases MANY COMPANIES will face rent bills for offices they abandoned long ago if they assigned their leases to businesses which later failed, according to Lambert Smith Hampton, the firm of chartered surveyors, Ian Hamilton Fazey writes. It says landlords can claw back rents and costs at current prices from previous lessees, even though many years have elapsed since they assigned the lease. Mr Tom Marshall, who heads Lambert's Manchester offfice, said companies in the south-east were in greater danger because of the surge in rents in the latter half of the 1980s. Mr Marshall cited a company which took a 25-year lease on 12,000 sq ft of offices in central London in 1974 at Pounds 12.50 per sq ft. It assigned this 10 years later to a profitable company which could afford a reviewed rent of Pounds 40, which rose to Pounds 62.50 in 1989. The assignee failed last year so the landlord sent its demand to the original lessee, which was still liable. Lambert said the company could face costs of nearly Pounds 4m. It points out that a result of companies becoming aware of the problem could be that balance sheets might look less healthy because contingent liabilities would have to be declared and provided for.</p>

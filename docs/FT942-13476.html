			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Arts: Today's Television It has come to a pretty pass when about the only thing in which we lead the world is the sleaziness of our tabloid press. The Hunt for Michael Jackson (BBC 2, 9pm) is an attempt by US television to dish the dirt on the beleagured pop star. It leans on the expertise of British journos buying into the confidences of Jackson's disaffected entourage. The programme has it both ways: pedalling gossip while throwing up its hands in horror at such mercenary goings on. The BBC's attempts to repair its audience share by screening a third episode of EastEnders was undermined by ITV extending Coronation Street to a full hour. Tonight Rowan Atkinson's Mind The Baby, Mr Bean is fielded at 8pm in an attempt to destroy the BBC soap. Why can't the UK produce a decent tennis player? Not for lack of money. Much of the profits from Wimbledon go into training young hopefuls and Champions: Hothouse Tennis (Channel 4, 9pm) takes us to the Lawn Tennis Association's school at Bisham Abbey - but offers little hope.</p>

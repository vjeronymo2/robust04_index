			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer Vladimir Baburin] On Tuesday we received  notice from the director of the Mosenergo joint-stock company  that our most powerful radio transmitter had been switched off  because of unpaid bills, which, our company, just like  Ostankino, is unable to pay as the state does not finance its  state TV and radio companies. True, this time the power workers  switched off the knife switch because the communications  industries have not been paying them, whom in turn the state has  also not been paying. Our correspondent Vladimir Mishnev rang  Anatoliy (Batyushkin), head of the Television and Radio  Broadcasting Department of the Communications Ministry:    [Begin recording] [Mishnev] Please tell us who must pay  those  bills.    [(Batyushkin)] The communications enterprises. It has been  decided to allocate funds for paying wages only to workers in  communications enterprises for the first quarter.    [Mishnev] It must be said that you do not have the money to  pay the power workers.    [(Batyushkin)] None at all.    [Mishnev] And in such a situation what will happen now?    [(Batyushkin)] Eventually there will be a natural withering  away.    [Mishnev] Please tell us whether the Finance Ministry is  contemplating paying the arrears.    [(Batyushkin)] The Finance Ministry says the following:  Bring  your broadcasting amount in accordance with the money that is  being allocated under the budget.    [Mishnev] So, the possibility is not ruled out that other  transmitters will also be switched off?    [(Batyushkin)] According to the results of work in the first  quarter, the power workers should now have switched off  virtually all TV and radio broadcasting.    [Mishnev] Who is to decide whether the transmitters are to  work?    [(Batyushkin)] I believe only the government. [end  recording]    [Baburin] So that for the umpteenth time the prospect of  reviving the old tradition of table-talk is beginning to loom  before us. After all, following the radio receivers, TV sets  could also be switched off. So, get ready to entertain one  another by retelling Santa Barbara parts you have already  watched, the others you might just not see.</p>

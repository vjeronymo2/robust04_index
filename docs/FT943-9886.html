			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / Oil companies tread warily in Nigerian strike: How western majors are coping with the dispute Western oil companies in Nigeria find themselves caught between a political hard place and a rock. As the industry enters the sixth week of a strike by oil workers, the companies are seeking a middle way between a military government determined to see off the opposition, and the workers who are demanding a handover to civilian rule. If the oil companies maintain output they risk being accused of supporting an unelected regime and alienating their workforce. There is also a possible danger to their non-striking staff and equipment from the more extremist opponents of the government. But if the companies, which account for more than 99 per cent of Nigeria's normal production of about 2m barrels a day cut output, they lose revenue and risk being accused by the Nigerian government of backing a politically motivated strike. Given the fact that oil accounts for over 90 per cent of Nigeria's foreign earnings and over 80 per cent of government revenue, any overt sign of support for the strikers would be viewed harshly by the military. There is no sign of an end to the oil workers' stoppage, which has spread to other unions in protest at the arrest on treason charges of Mr Moshood Abiola over his claims to be president. Production has fallen by more than a quarter, with most of the loss from onshore fields operated by the Anglo-Dutch Shell group. It normally produces half Nigeria's oil but has cut output to about 500,000 barrels a day, according to industry sources. 'We are trying to maintain as much as possible of the industry and prevent an escalation of danger in a very delicate situation,' said Mr Brian Anderson, chairman of Shell's Nigerian affiliate, in Lagos yesterday. 'We have rejected the government's offer of military protection in order to maintain full production. I do not believe that protection is possible in some of our fields,' which are spread across a vast area of the Niger delta. 'There are too many small fields too exposed to attack or sabotage. We do not believe that calling in troops is the answer and could lead to even more serious trouble,' said Mr Anderson. For the first month of the strike, Shell kept the oil flowing with the use of non-union management and expatriate staff, and some contract workers, to replace the skilled engineers of the senior staff association Pengassan on strike. Normal maintenance has been neglected, however, and development of new capacity is impossible. Recently threats against strike-breakers were followed up by attacks. Two of the staff were beaten up for continuing to work and minor sabotage, carried out by strikers, halted some plants. Shell began to pull its staff out of the most dangerous fields and declared force majeure, enabling them to default on supply contracts. Mr Anderson rejects charges that Shell is siding with the unions, with whom the company will always have to work, regardless of the tenure of the present regime. 'We are certainly not taking sides with anyone, we are non-political' he said. 'We would like to maintain full production and we want a resolution of this crisis. But I am not prepared to risk the lives of my staff or risk more serious sabotage and I do not want to inflame the situation.' He says Shell has to achieve 'a fine balance'. 'We want to retain our assets, both staff and equipment, so that we can recover when this is resolved. We have old fields, with high water content, especially in the western region. You don't just turn on the taps and it starts to flow.' Other companies are also beginning to report supply disruptions, but on a lesser scale than that affecting Shell. Chevron, the third largest producer, is said to have lost about 15 per cent of its 350,000 b/d output and Mobil, the second largest has been even less affected. Both operate offshore or in onshore enclaves which are easier to protect and have fewer fields. Elf's offshore operation of about 60,000 bpd has been shut down but Elf continues to produce offshore. In the longer term the strike will worsen a decline in investment which began almost a year ago. The government, which owns 58 per cent of the joint ventures with the multinationals has fallen further behind on paying its share of costs, with the backlog now estimated at Pounds 800m. The 1994 budget for exploration and production has been cut from Dollars 4bn to Dollars 3bn, inadequate to maintain future capacity. Rising costs are already cutting into the multinationals' fixed profit margin of Dollars 1 a barrel. At Dollars 19 a barrel this is about 5 per cent. But the government arrears have forced a halt on investment. The big multinationals can survive a temporary drop in revenue but political instability and state-led under-investment are dimming the one bright spot in Nigeria's economy over the past eight years.</p>

			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHANNEL 9: SEED FOR A NETWORK?;  </P> <P> DISNEY HINTS IT WILL BUY A NUMBER OF STATIONS -- IF THE PRICE IS RIGHT  </P> <P> While acknowledging that obtaining a TV station in the home market of their  Burbank-based corporation was an important incentive for shelling out $320  million for KCAL Channel 9, top Disney executives also hint that the company is  not about to stop there.  </P> <P> "We are not looking to develop another network, but television stations  purchased at the right price are good investments," said Richard Frank,  president of the Walt Disney Studios and former general manager of KCOP Channel  13 in Los Angeles. "The price of stations has stabilized. Now we need them to  do a click or two down. We look at every (station) group that comes up for  sale, and I believe that the time will come when we will buy a group."  </P> <P> Frank said that Disney is interested primarily in station groups that include  outlets in the top 20 or 30 markets in the country, preferably independents  rather than network affiliates.  </P> <P> Aside from simply being big money makers, television stations, especially those  in heavily populated areas, would give a multi-tentacled company like Disney  what studio executives like to call "synergistic" benefits.  </P> <P> Disney has already cross-promoted Disneyland on KCAL by hosting the station's  afternoon children's block of programming from the amusement park. Programs  that the studio syndicates, such as "Siskel &amp; Ebert" and reruns of "The  Golden Girls," could be distributed to stations it owns. And a station group  can also be used to develop programs that can then be syndicated across the  country. Fox, for example, first tested "A Current Affair" and "America's Most  Wanted" on its own stations before distributing them nationwide.  </P> <P> Disney Chairman Michael Eisner calls KCAL a "slight insurance policy" for the  distribution of Disney programming.  </P> <P> "We don't believe in buying motion picture theaters because anyone can build a  movie theater on any corner in the country, so there is no prohibition in  getting your product played," he said. "That's not quite true in  government-regulated broadcasting. We felt that it was a good idea to at least  have a presence to help us understand what was going on."  </P> <P> Eisner would not comment on ongoing rumors that Disney is about to get its own  network in one fell swoop by buying CBS. But Randy Reiss, executive vice  president of Walt Disney Studios, said, "Since that's our business, I'm sure  there's interest." Disney would have to sell KCAL if it bought CBS, because CBS  owns KCBS Channel 2, and federal regulations prohibit the ownership of more  than one television station in the same city.  </P> <P> No matter how many stations it eventually buys, Disney is unlikely to put the  company name on any of them. When Disney was renaming KHJ, Reiss said that  station executives wanted to call it KDIS or K-WALT because they thought the  Disney name and reputation would attract viewers. But just as Disney calls its  adult-oriented movie unit Touchstone, it chose to call its TV station KCAL.  </P> <P> "We would've loved to call it Disney, but there are too many restrictions,"  Reiss said. "Many people look at Disney as a baby sitter. There's a certain  comfort level and you can't abuse that. Could your news be as appropriate as it  should? Could you run 'A-Team'? Who knows the programs that we couldn't do. It  was too much of a burden. Our feeling was we'd like it now, but we'd regret it  later." STEVE WEINSTEIN  </P></p>

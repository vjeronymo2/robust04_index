			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Joint interview with French President Francois Mitterrand </F> and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl by unidentified WORLD MEDIA  correspondents; place and date not given: "Unification -- An  Issue of War and Peace for the 21st Century"]    [Excerpts] German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French  President Francois Mitterrand granted a special joint interview  to the WORLD MEDIA network, of which LIDOVE NOVINY is a part, on  the occasion of the commemorations held to mark the 50th  anniversary of the Normandy landings. [passage omitted]    [WORLD MEDIA] The anniversary of the landings has also  brought to mind the impressive entry of the United States onto  the European scene. What kind of military role should the  United States be playing in Europe now?    [Kohl] The connection with the North American democracies  and the U.S. presence in Europe are visible symbols for  Europeans of the values shared on both sides of the Atlantic, as  well as the basis for defending peace and security in Europe. I  am pleased, therefore, that, at the recent NATO summit,  President Clinton renewed the commitment to maintain 100,000  troops in Europe. An active transatlantic alliance, along with  the European Union, is a fundamental condition for ensuring that  the new European democracies can be brought into the Western  community.    [Mitterrand] The vitality of the connection between the  United States and Europe is a basic element of our security, and  the U.S. military presence in Europe illustrates this  connection. Therefore, during the current discussions on NATO's  development, I always defended the view that nothing should be  done that would divert the alliance from its fundamental task of  being a security guarantee for its members. Of course, this  should not prevent the Europeans from creating a common defense.  We have made progress here too. I had the feeling at the  recent Atlantic summit that our overseas partners understood  that strengthening the Western European Union [WEU] is not aimed  at weakening NATO, but that it represents Europe's desire to  accept the responsibility for its own security and defense and  that it leads to it being able to provide long-term guarantees  in harmony with the preamble to the North Atlantic Treaty.    [WORLD MEDIA] France and Germany have agreed to establish a  joint military force, a "European Corps." In your opinion, is  this the nucleus for a future European army?    [Kohl] By creating a European unit, President Mitterrand and  myself wanted, from the very beginning, to give a European  aspect to close Franco-German cooperation. Since then, our  invitation to the WEU states to take part in units has been  accepted by Belgium, and Spanish membership is being discussed.  The European unit will operate in 1995, and it already  represents a successful model for European military structures.  It is strengthening both the WEU and European involvement in  NATO. It may also be a prototype for further European units  within the increasingly closer Union. I am especially pleased  that President Mitterrand has invited German, French, and  Belgian units to Paris for a parade on 14 July.    [Mitterrand] My answer is clearly, yes. Will the embryo  grow and will a European army be born from it? Time will answer  this question. I believe, however, that the progressive  establishment of a truly European defense body, supplied with  the necessary equipment and serving common aims will, at the  appropriate moment, be a real gauge of the European Union's  success.    [WORLD MEDIA] The recent commemorations reminded us that the  United States plays a significant role in European politics,  culture, and society. How does this role appear to you? Does  it symbolize current relations between the United States and  Europe?    [Kohl] The transatlantic bridge that links us firmly with  the United States and Canada had, primarily, a security  significance during the Cold War. Now, we must make this bridge  more passable and intensify cooperation in spheres such as the  economy, culture, and science. First and foremost, the  intensity of the exchanges between young people, who could  reinforce friendship across the Atlantic, is important.    [Mitterrand] The United States has an important position in  Europe on all levels. This is given by its qualities, dynamism,  and creativity. It is also given, of course, by its economic  strength and the size of its market. Our most major competitors  are here, which is intensified even more by our nonuniformity.  Despite this, we in Europe have at our disposal considerable  creative potential in technology, science, culture, art, and so  on. As far as I am concerned, I consider this fact to be one of  the other reasons for strengthening the European Union and this  may then enhance the dialogue between Europe and the United  States.</p>

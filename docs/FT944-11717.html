			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Abbey National takes 9.9% stake in Irish Permanent Abbey National, the mortgage lender and banking group, has taken a 9.9 per cent stake in Irish Permanent, the former building society which converted and floated last month, in a move set to strengthen ties between the two organisations. Mr Peter Birch, Abbey chief executive, said he believed there was scope for co-operation between the two groups, perhaps in areas such as Treasury operations or shared use of cash dispenser networks. Mr Roy Douglas, Irish Permanent chief executive, said the move by Abbey was a 'vote of confidence.' Welcoming the prospect of co-operation in some areas, he said he saw few opportunities for this in terms of life insurance business: Abbey National owns Scottish Mutual, while in July Irish Permanent bought Prudential Life of Ireland for Pounds 30m cash. Mr Birch said Abbey intended to maintain a long-term minority investment in Irish Permanent, and would keep its options open. Irish legislation says that no organisation can have a stake of more than 10 per cent in a licensed bank without approval from the central bank; and that no one can own more than 15 per cent of a former building society for five years after conversion. Abbey's stake in Irish Permanent, which has been built up over the past week, cost between Pounds 15m and Pounds 17m overall. On a per share basis the range was between 180p and 220p. Irish Permanent was Ireland's largest society before its conversion. It is well-placed in the Irish retail financial market, but its cost/income ratio is the highest in the industry in Ireland. Abbey's move comes against a background of increasing interest in the Irish banking sector. Both National Westminster Bank and National Australia Bank are known to be bidding for TSB Bank (which is not connected with the TSB group in the UK), which is currently state-owned.</p>

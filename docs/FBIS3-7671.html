			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Safe Areas in Cambodia"] </F>   [Text] The Phnom Penh Government and Khmer Rouge troops  were engaged in heavy battles for the control of Cambodia's  Pailin township several days ago. Consequently, over 25,000  Cambodians fled the fighting to take safe refuge at Phakkat  Village in the border district of Pong Nam Ron of Chanthaburi  Province. For humanitarian reasons, Thailand had to allow these  refugees to stay on its soil on a temporary basis, which was a  truely praiseworthy act. The Thai Government has clearly  announced worldwide that Thailand has no policy of taking any  more refugees, following the recent permanent closure of all  refugee camps in the country.    An interesting point to note regarding the influx of the  Cambodian refugees is the proposal put forth by the National  Security Council [NSC] for the setting up of safe areas inside  Cambodian territory. The NSC said that the situation after the  formation of the Cambodian Government has been relatively safe  for the setting up of a haven accessible to the UNHCR officials  to provide direct assistance to war victims.    The reasons cited by the NSC in making such a proposal are  compatible with the Thai Government's intention not to allow  Cambodians to take refuge in Thailand following the closure of  the refugee camps. The past policy of the government in  providing shelter to the war-displaced Cambodians was made,  besides for humanitarian reasons, on the grounds that Cambodia  in those days was under the control of warring factions, none of  which were recognized by the world community. But now Cambodia  is now ruled by the national government, the latter must be  responsible for the safety and well-being of the Cambodian  people.    We fully support such a clear-cut policy of the Thai  Government and NSC. We must tell the world that things have  changed. The UNHCR and other countries have the right to ask  Thailand to reopen the refugee camps. However, Thailand has the  right to reject their request because we also have to work on  our own problems.    Thailand's philanthropic activities in connection with the  Cambodian refugees have been praised by some countries. But, at  the same time, many other countries criticized the way Thailand  handled the refugee problem in spite of the fact Thailand gained  nothing from keeping the refugees in the country. This is an  important issue that requires careful and thorough  consideration. It is recommended that Prime Minister Chuan  Likphai issue a statement to tell the world that Thailand is not  obligated to walk along the path drawn by the UNHCR.</p>

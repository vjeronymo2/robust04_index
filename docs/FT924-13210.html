			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Norwegian ratification Norway's parliament is expected to ratify the European Economic Area (EEA) agreement by a narrow margin today, despite many demonstrations against the deal, writes Karen Fossli in Oslo. The pact - to link the European Community and the European Free Trade Association, of which Norway is a member - needs the backing of two-thirds of the country's 165-seat parliament. At least 42 votes would be needed to block it, but only 35 or 37 representatives are expected to vote against it. About 20,000 North Sea oil workers staged a one-hour strike opposing the ratification, which they claim would jeopardise their jobs when Norway is opened to foreign competition.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "Dangerous Military Action Aimed at Us"] </F>   [Text] The recent situation surrounding the Korean  peninsula is moving into an ill-boding direction with each  passing day. As reported, the Rimpac military exercise  participated in by the armed forces from the United States,  Japan, and South Korea is being staged on the waters of the West  Pacific Ocean close to our country, and this exercise which  began at the end of May, will continue for 50 days until  mid-July.    The exercise is being mobilized by the U.S. naval forces as  its main force with some 60 additional naval ships and 200  airplanes and vast forces of over 25,000 troops from  participating nations.    Our attention is drawn to the fact that, for the first time  in history, naval forces of the United States, Japan, and South  Korea are staging joint operations and forming one single fleet.  This is an intolerable, reckless, military action when  considering the fact that the U.S. imperialists are perpetrating  arms reinforcement maneuvers in South Korea under the pretext of  so-called sanctions against us and laying the blame on the  nonexistent nuclear issue.    The fact that the military bosses of the United States,  Japan, and South Korea, who have been holding frequent  conspiratorial conferences of aggression against us, have gone  so far as to stage joint operations by organizing a joint naval  fleet this time, vividly shows that the tripartite military  alliance that was formed long ago with the United States as its  main axis and with the aim of crushing our country and other  socialist countries in Asia, has entered a practical stage.    Our people are watching with vigilance the U.S.  imperialists'  intention to persistently perpetrate the military action against  our Republic through these joint operations that have become  more unscrupulous, and strongly condemn the Rimpac-94 military  exercise.    As reported, the DPRK Foreign Ministry, in its spokesman's  press statement of 23 May regarding the recent moves of the  situation surrounding the Korean peninsula in an ominous  direction, called upon the United States not to cling to  military action, but to respond to our peaceful initiatives.  The dangerous military situation prevailing on the Korean  peninsula and the area surrounding it, shows that our proposal  for negotiations to establish a new solid peace-guarantee system  which will replace the military armistice mechanism in our  country, is correct and timely.    Nevertheless, the U.S. imperialists are further expanding  and  strengthening military pressure on us through the Rimpac  exercise in a bid to subdue us by force.    This is proven by the open remarks by an official of the  Japan Defense Agency that the Rimpac-94 exercise is a political  message to North Korea's nuclear program.    In particular, we cannot overlook the fact that the British  paper SUNDAY TIMES of 5 June revealed that U.S. President  Clinton was reviewing a plan to move the Rimpac military  exercise site from the Pacific near Hawaii to the East Sea of  North Korea in a bid to apply pressure on North Korea.    The U.S. imperialists are threatening and blackmailing us by  mobilizing the multinational armed forces from Japan and South  Korea. By so doing, the U.S. imperialists attempt to extremely  aggravate the situation on the Korean peninsula and, thus, to  invent an excuse for a military adventure against our Republic.    The U.S. imperialists will gain nothing from us through the  Rimpac-94 exercises. The United States should not cling to the  adventurous military action against us by mobilizing their  follower countries, but should respond to our peaceful  initiatives.    The U.S. imperialists should clearly know that any  sanctions,  pressure, or action for aggression does not work out in our  Republic which treasures the country's sovereignty and the  nation's dignity. They should behave with discretion.</p>

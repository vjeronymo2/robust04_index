			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Neighbour wants my shed moved SOME YEARS ago, I replaced a broken-down fence, as required by my property deeds. I also moved my garden shed (originally erected there in 1968) a few inches nearer to my boundary but on a new, level, concrete base. My present neighbour now wants me to move the fence end-post and re-position the shed, claiming both are on his land. The original fence end-post (erected in 1957) abutted my neighbour's garden wall. My replacement fence end-post is embedded in about one ton of concrete 5 inches from my neighbour's wall. The shed was re-positioned abutting my neighbour's boundary wall. If I am on my neighbour's land, the fence end-posts and shed have been there a long time. Do I really have to dig out all that concrete and dismantle a shed to re-erect it a few inches away? If your end-post and part of the shed are, in fact, on land which belonged originally to your neighbour, you will almost certainly have acquired a title by more than 12 years' adverse possession (ie, the occupation by these features of their actual sites for some 15 years or more). Moreover, it seems likely that your fencing used to enclose an even greater area of your neighbour's land before you re-erected the end-post (from 1957 to the date when you replaced the fence). Thus, the neighbour might have lost land by 1970, but regained part of it when you re-sited the end-post. You are in a position to resist your neighbour's request if you wish. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Beijing Political Situation" column article by Jen Hui-wen </F> (0117 1979 2429) in Beijing on 27 April 1994: "The CPC's  Purpose in Making Zhu Rongji Acting Premier"]    [Text] Chinese Premier Li Peng left Beijing on 18 April to  pay official visits to Uzbekistan and other Central Asian  countries. At the news conference held at the Great Hall of the  People before his departure, Li Peng announced that Vice Premier  Zhu Rongji would be acting premier of the State Council during  his foreign visit. As everyone knows, during the last term of  the State Council, each time Li Peng made a foreign visit, he  announced that then executive vice premier Yao Yilin was acting  premier. Since Zhu Rongji became vice premier in 1991, this was  the first time he had become acting premier. Why did the  Chinese authorities make such a decision? What was the purpose  of such an arrangement?    Let us first see how the decision was made. According to  sources in Beijing, the appointment of Zhu Rongji as acting  premier was one of the personnel arrangements made by the CPC  top leadership recently, and these arrangements included:    1. In accordance with the actual needs of the work of the  State Council, during Li Peng's foreign visits and his absence  from Beijing on other official missions, Zhu Rongji will be  acting premier of the State Council.    2. Zhu Rongji and Zou Jiahua are executive vice premiers of  the State Council.    3. The party leading group of the State Council is composed  of Li Peng as secretary, Zhu Rongji as deputy secretary, and  Qian Qichen (vice premier and foreign minister), Chi Haotian  (state councillor and national defense minister), and Luo Gan  (state councillor and seretary general) as members of the  Standing Committee.    4. Tian Jiyun, Wang Hanbin, Qin Jiwei, and Ni Zhifu are  executive vice chairmen of the Standing Committee of the  National People's Congress [NPC].    People in Beijing political circles held that the  above-mentioned personnel arrangements were made according to  the work performances of the individuals and the needs of the  work. Such arrangements also balanced representatives from the  party, the government, and the military. So they were favorable  to strengthening unity in the top leading bodies and to  quickening the pace of establishing the new market economic  structure. Thus, the authorities will more effectively carry  out the domestic and foreign policies of maintaining  independence and extensively making friends in the world. The  arrangements also indicated that the status of Zhu Rongji and  Qian Qichen had been raised, and that they would shoulder  greater responsibilities. The two political rising stars will  play more important roles in China's domestic and foreign  affairs in the future if things do not go beyond general  expectations. Qian Qichen, who is also deputy leader of the CPC  Central Leading Group for Taiwan Affairs, will also have a  weightier say on the CPC's policy toward Taiwan, Hong Kong, and  Macao.    The sources also revealed that the CPC top leadership's  decision on appointing Zhu Rongji as acting premier was made in  accordance with a proposal by Deng Xiaoping. During the NPC  session in March this year, Deng Xiaoping twice mentioned the  need to create the post of acting premier.    Once, Deng Xiaoping met with Qian Qichen and listened to  Qian's report about recent diplomatic work. Afterward, Deng  said: "Is Big Peng (Li Peng) in good health? He should take  care of his health. He is still young and will have to do a lot  of work. The workload in the State Council is heavy. I think  that in the future when the premier makes foreign visits, an  acting premier should be appointed to take charge of the State  Council's routine work. Can the Political Bureau consider this?"    On another occasion, on 22 March, Deng Xiaoping met with  party and government leaders of some provinces, autonomous  regions, and municipalities. He talked about two issues. One  was the need to safeguard the authority of the CPC Central  Committee and the State Council; and the other was the  reiteration of the need to "have two strong hands." He stressed  that they must not have only one strong hand, with the other  hand remaining weak, and should first toughen the style of the  leading body. When talking about the work of the State Council,  Deng said: "The workload of the State Council is heavier than  before, but they are cooperating quite well. It is right that  they continue to cooperate although there is division of work  among them. Last year, Big Peng was ill for some time, and  Rongji did a lot of work. Qichen also shared the workload.  According to the needs of the work, the State Council should  create the post of acting premier in the future. The State  Council is a governmental institution, and it is different from  the party's central Political Bureau and the Central Military  Commission."    Obviously, Deng Xiaoping's proposal on creating the post of  acting premier was aimed at making Zhu Rongji acting premier  during Li Peng's foreign visits. The CPC central leading body  understood this and immediately made the corresponding decision.  This showed that although Deng Xiaoping had long withdrawn from  the political stage, he still influenced the decisionmaking  operation of the third-generation leading collective of the CPC  in the capacity of a CPC member and a people's deputy. This may  be regarded as Deng Xiaoping's thoughtful support for the  third-generation leading body, but it also showed that the  current leading body still lacked the insight and courage to  make independent decisions. This was precisely one of the  reasons why people could not trust them unreservedly.    The sources said that it was true that Zhu Rongji was  promoted and appointed to such a crucially important top leading  post because he was able and especially had the ability to  handle economic affairs, but that he would not have the status  he has today without Deng Xiaoping's bold recommendation. In  the eyes of leftist-minded leaders, Zhu Rongji, who was labeled  a rightist in the past, could never be a politically reliable  person. Only Deng Xiaoping had the ability to remove this  obstruction.    So, how did Deng Xiaoping discover Zhu Rongji? After the 4  June Incident in 1989, Deng Xiaoping continued to seek someone  who was able to open up a new path for reform. From Zhu  Rongji's work performance as mayor of Shanghai, Deng felt that  Zhu should be the right man. In early February 1991, as Deng  Xiaoping had the intention of promoting Zhu to be vice premier  of the State Council, he went to Shanghai with Li Xiannian and  Yang Shangkun, and consulted them on this idea. In Shanghai,  when Zhu Rongji reported to Deng Xiaoping on the plan to first  develop financial business, trade, and infrastructural  facilities in Pudong's development, Deng Xiaoping expressed  appreciation again and again, and said: "I have been saying  that we should have new ideas for reform, and that means new  methods and measures different from those in the previous 10  years should be worked out. So we need to study the new  conditions, and explore new ways. The key lies in further  emancipating the mind. The planned economy should not be  equated with socialism, and the market economy should not be  equated with capitalism, because there is planning in capitalism  and there is a market in socialism. We cannot be bogged down in  a new form of ideological ossification on this issue." Deng  Xiaoping not only expressed this idea to Zhu Rongji, but also  selected Zhu for the "premier body" later. Obviously, Deng hoped  that Zhu would be more open-minded in creating a new situation  in reform and opening.    After Zhu Rongji was promoted to be vice premier, Deng  Xiaoping again named him as a member of his entourage on his  inspection tour to Shougang [7445 6921] in May that year. Deng  praised Zhu Rongji for being an able person with economic  knowledge. Zhu did not let him down, and successfully fulfilled  a number of tough tasks, including the settlement of the  accumulated debt chains, the arrangements for adjusting the  industrial and production structure, the transformation of the  operation mechanism of the state-owned enterprises, the pilot  schemes for adopting the joint-stock system, and the  preparations for and reestablishment of the State Economic  Commission. Zhu's work was widely praised and appreciated by  people in economic and other circles. Since June 1993 he has  further successfully organized macrocontrol and rectified the  overheated economy. Deng not only praised Zhu but also  instructed him to "turn the banks into true banks" rather than  "currency-issuing companies or state treasuries." In November  1993, the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee adopted the "Decision on Building the Socialist Market  Economic Structure." After that, Zhu Rongji became the top  architect of the banking and taxation reforms in the course of  building the socialist market economic structure, and was  regarded as one who had the best understanding of Deng  Xiaoping's line. He became number two man in the State Council  next to Li Peng, and naturally held the position of first vice  premier.    However, Zhu Rongji is also facing various difficulties in  the deep-going economic structural reform. For example, debt  chains are accumulating again; the situation in which  state-owned enterprises continue to incur serious losses has not  yet been thoroughly changed; and inflation is becoming more  serious. All these will be new tests for him. Time will prove  whether he can tide over the difficulties and create a new  situation.</p>

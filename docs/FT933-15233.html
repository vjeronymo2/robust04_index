			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / International Company News: Uni to be released from state control next week NORWAY'S finance ministry will free Uni Storebrand, the country's biggest insurer, from public administration on July 13. The move, announced yesterday, is conditional on Uni's creditors demanding no more than NKr420m (Dollars 60.9m), or an average interest rate of 11 per cent, in interest payments since the time Uni was put under state control after it collapsed last August. Uni's debts will be repaid in full, the ministry said. However, some of Uni's creditors said Norwegian law would allow higher rates of interest to be repaid. Uni collapsed with debt of NKr3.8bn used to finance a failed raid on Skandia Forsakrings, Sweden's biggest insurer. The move follows a recapitalisation of the group in which a recent share offer raised NKr2.8bn and a bond issue raised another NKr1.5bn.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Natalya Bespalova report under the "Colleagues" rubric: </F> "Two Newspapers Under the Same Name. One of Them Is Certainly  One Too Many"]    [Text] The saying that practice makes perfect is nearly  universal. This was confirmed by the publication of SNG:  OBSHCHIY RYNOK [CIS: COMMON MARKET] -- the first collective  newspaper of the CIS countries. The decision on founding it was  made 23 December 1993 at the Ashkhabad [Ashgabat] meeting of the  CIS heads of government. According to the concept devised by  the newspaper's editorial board, which included representatives  of all republics that signed the agreement, the new publication  was designed to help create a common economic space on CIS  territory and also forge closer business contacts between  representatives of various states. It was decided to publish the  new periodical on the basis of Yegor Yakovlev's OBSHCHAYA  GAZETA. The publisher states agreed to earmark 950 million  rubles and $200,000 for this purpose. Vitaliy Kovalenko was  appointed the newspaper's editor-in-chief.    At the beginning of 1994, however, legal inconsistencies  inherent in the agreement on setting up the newspaper sparked a  conflict between the OBSHCHAYA GAZETA board and SNG: OBSHCHIY  RYNOK's staff, the bulk of which was made up of journalists who  left ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA after the October events. On one hand,  under the document the OBSHCHAYA GAZETA editorial board is to  exercise day-to-day control over the new publication's activity;  on the other, it does not have the right to intervene in the  work of an independent paper. This discrepancy promptly led to  disagreements between Yegor Yakovlev and Vitaliy Kovalenko.    Both sides have been advancing weighty arguments to support  their stances, and the dispute over who is to head the new  publication threatens to drag on indefinitely. It can be  resolved only by a new meeting of the newspaper's editorial  board, at which representatives of the CIS member states will  have to decide once again on who should steer their periodical.  So far, a paradoxical situation has come about where two  absolutely different newspapers under the same name -- SNG:  OBSHCHIY RYNOK -- appeared at an interval of three days, on 12  and 15 April. The first one was published by journalists under  Vitaliy Kovalenko, the second by the OBSHCHAYA GAZETA staff.  Both sides claim that the only genuine newspaper is theirs.</p>

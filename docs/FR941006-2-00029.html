Texas Gas Transmission Corp. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> [Docket No. CP94&hyph;805&hyph;000] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Take notice that on September 26, 1994, Texas Gas Transmission Corporation (Texas Gas), 3800 Frederica Street, Owensboro, Kentucky 42301, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;805&hyph;000, a request pursuant to &sect;&sect;157.205 and 157.212 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205 and 157.212) for authorization to add a new delivery point in Carroll County, Kentucky to serve an existing customer, Carrollton Utilities (Carrollton), under Texas Gas's blanket certificate issued to Texas Gas in Docket No. CP82&hyph;407&hyph;000 pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Texas Gas states that the new delivery point will enable Carrollton to provide natural gas service to a new industrial customer, Gallatin Steel, as well as accommodate additional load growth in the area. The proposed delivery point, to be known as the Carrollton  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2 Delivery Point, will be located on Texas Gas's No. 1 and No. 2 main lines near Wright's Ridge Road in Carroll County, Kentucky. The estimated maximum annual quantity of natural gas to be delivered to Carrollton at the new point will be 7,000,000 MMBtu, with a proposed maximum daily quantity of 28,800 MMBtu. Texas Gas states that service to this new delivery point will be accomplished within Carrollton's existing contract quantities and without detriment to Texas Gas's other customers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment date:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> November 14, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph G at the end of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Shell Gas Pipeline Company and BP Exploration &amp; Oil, Inc. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> [Docket No. CP94&hyph;808&hyph;000] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Take notice that on September 27, 1994, Shell Gas Pipeline Company, P.O. Box 576, Houston, Texas 77001, and BP Exploration &amp; Oil, Inc. (BP), P.O. Box 4527, Houston, Texas 77210&hyph;4587, referred to together as Petitioners, jointly filed a petition for declaratory order in Docket No. CP94&hyph;808&hyph;000, requesting that the Commission declare that facilities to be constructed on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) would have the primary function of gathering natural gas and would thereby be exempt from the Commission's jurisdiction pursuant to Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the petition which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitioners state that they propose to construct the MARS Gas Gathering System to attach natural gas produced from the Mississippi Canyon 807 Unit (MARS), produced by Shell Offshore, Inc. (SOI) and BP, to a point on interconnection with the existing offshore jurisdictional natural gas transmission infrastructure. Petitioners state that the MARS project would be located about 130 miles southeast of New Orleans in a water depth of 2,940 feet and is estimated to have approximately 700 million barrel equivalent of oil and natural gas reserves. Petitioners indicate that the MARS prospect was discovered in 1989 and is reported to be the largest discovery in the Gulf of Mexico in the past 20 years. It is stated that SOI and BP have committed $1.2 billion for the initial development of the MARS prospect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is stated that phase 1 of the MARS prospect would be developed by installing a tension leg platform (TLP) which would be secured to the ocean floor by vertical tendons. It is also indicated that up to 24 oil and gas production wells would be drilled and completed from the TLP via sub-sea flowlines. Petitioners state that initial production from the TLP is expected to commence in the second half of 1996 and production is forecasted to eventually reach peak daily rates of approximately 100,000 barrels of oil and 110,000 Mcf on natural gas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitioners state that the system would consist of a 14-inch pipeline extending approximately 45 to 60 miles from the TLP to a shelf interconnection platform in the OCS area, Offshore Louisiana. It is also indicated that the project would also include certain related facilities, that may include one or more gas sales meter stations, a pig launcher and receivers, risers, slug catcher, sumps, drains, over-pressure protection facilities, gas and condensate meters and condensate pumps.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitioners state that the exact terminus of the MARS Gas Gathering Pipeline at which the TLP would be located is still under evaluation and negotiation, with the petitioners intending to select an interconnection platform or platforms allowing connection to one or more pipelines in the South Pass and Mississippi Canyon Areas. Petitioners indicates that the design capacity of the pipeline would be 160,000 Mcf per day at an operating pressure of 1,650 psig. It is stated that the production would be separated and dehydrated on the TLP as this is necessary to prevent the formation of hydrates in the line, and compressed on the platform to a pressure which is sufficient to overcome the pressure drop in the proposed MARS pipeline as well as to allow the gas to flow into the downstream interstate pipeline. It is also stated that the gas may be processed onshore for the removal of liquids.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Klaus Murmann, president of the Employers </F> Association, by Rolf Bier; place and date not given: "This is  what Industry Thinks of Scharping...."]    [Text] [Bier] With what government would industry be best  able to cooperate after the elections?    [Murmann] With one that further reduces public spending,  cuts the taxation and debt burden, and tackles structural  reforms in the social security system.    [Bier] What does industry think of Scharping as a  chancellor...?    [Murmann] Securing Germany as a business location is also  one of Mr. Scharping's aims. But I fear that the actual policy  of the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] would fall back  into its old models and thinking patterns, for instance  regarding taxation and monetary policy.    [Bier] ...And what about a red-green coalition?    [Murmann] I prefer a Kohl government. The economy and a  red-green coalition are not at all a favorable perspective for  Germany as a business location. I do not think much of putting  together certain and uncertain risks.    [Bier] What do you think of the SPD's plans to change the  solidarity surcharge to a tax on higher incomes?    [Murmann] I have already spoken of patterns laden with  ideology. I would like to warn against attacking top  performers. If the SPD sticks with exchanging the solidarity  surcharge for a supplementary charge after the election  campaign, it will also have to increase taxes.    [Bier] What do you think of a super ministry combining  economic and financial affairs?    [Murmann] Although I am very much in favor of reducing the  number of ministries, and although the work of the economics  ministry urgently needs to be reconsidered, I favor keeping them  separate.    [Bier] Do government employment promotion programs help  industry?    [Murmann] Government employment programs burden the existing  jobs through additional taxes. But we need cheaper jobs to get  the unemployed back to work. This cannot be done overnight, but  it is the only sensible solution.</p>

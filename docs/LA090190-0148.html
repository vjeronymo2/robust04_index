			<p><P> September 1, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BEAR BRAND COMMUNITY RESIDENTS MAY FIGHT COMMERCIAL CENTER  </P> <P> Residents in the Bear Brand community will probably appeal the Planning  Commission's approval of plans for a 17-acre commercial center there, a  community spokesman said Thursday.  </P> <P> The project, which calls for restaurants, office buildings and a six-screen  theater on the northeast corner of Camino del Avion and Street of the Golden  Lantern, was approved by the Planning Commission earlier this week.  </P> <P> The 3-2 vote was cast only after 34 conditions were attached to the project,  senior planner Micki Harris said.  </P> <P> Commissioners Brian Fisk and Marc Winer voted against the project.  </P> <P> Community spokesman Paul Konapelsky said Thursday that homeowners are still  unhappy about the project, which will block ocean views in the upscale  neighborhood.  </P> <P> Residents' main concerns revolve around the density of the center and the  people and cars it will attract, he said.  </P> <P> The project is expected to generate an additional 14,060 automobile trips each  day.  </P> <P> "The size of the project is the main issue, along with the types of uses within  the project," Konapelsky said. "The biggest issue is the movie theater."  </P> <P> A proposed service station has been deleted from the project and a 65-foot  monument has been replaced with a waterfall.  </P> <P> The overall size of the project has been reduced by about 3,800 square feet,  according to the staff report.  </P> <P> The Planning Commission has final authority to approve the plans unless they  are successfully appealed to the City Council.  </P></p>

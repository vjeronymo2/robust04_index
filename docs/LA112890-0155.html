			<p><P> November 28, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> GNP GROWTH FIGURES REVISED DOWNWARD;  </P> <P> TRANSPORTATION SECTOR FUELS RISE IN DURABLE ORDERS  </P> <P> Orders to U.S. factories for "big-ticket" durable goods jumped 3.6% in October,  driven by a 14.6% gain in the transportation sector, the government said today.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department reported that orders for durable goods -- items  expected to last more than three years -- totaled a seasonally adjusted $129.4  billion.  </P> <P> It was the largest advance since a 4.1% gain in May.  </P> <P> Excluding transportation, however, orders fell 0.4% last month.  </P> <P> Orders fell 1.6% in September and 0.9% in August.  </P> <P> "Since reaching a high in December, 1988, of $132.1 billion, orders have been  unstable, fluctuating around a monthly average of $125.9 billion," the  department said. "Much of the volatility was attributable to transportation  equipment."  </P> <P> Durable goods orders are a key barometer of manufacturing industry plans for  production. A decrease in orders could result in a slump in that sector and  subsequent job layoffs.  </P> <P> Transportation orders totaled $37.9 billion, reflecting purchases of both  aircraft and automobiles. They had fallen 6.1% in September after a 1% gain the  previous month.  </P> <P> Orders in the key category of non-defense capital goods, often a barometer of  business plans to expand and modernize, rose 8.3% to $41.4 billion after  advancing 6.7% in September.  </P> <P> Only orders for non-electrical machinery and for defense goods posted declines.  Non-electrical machinery orders were off 1.5%.  </P></p>

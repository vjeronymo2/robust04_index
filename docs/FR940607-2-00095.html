Introduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On July 12, 1989, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  a proposed rule change to amend NYSE Rules 79A.30 and 123A.40. On March 15, 1993, the NYSE submitted Amendment No. 1 to the rule filing. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Amendment No. 1 limited the proposed rule change to NYSE Rule 79A.30 to securities trading at $100 or over.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 28202 (July 13, 1990), 55 FR 29696 (July 20, 1990). No comments were received on the proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Description of the Proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Currently, all transactions made at one point or more away from the last previous sale when such previous sale is under $20 per share, or at two points or more away from the last previous sale when such previous sale is at $20 per share or over, may not be published on the tape without the prior approval of a Floor Official. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  The rule change to NYSE Rule 79A.30 will permit a Floor Governor, during unusual market conditions, to change the two point parameter requiring Floor Official approval for a particular security when the last previous sale for such security occurs at $100 per share or more. The special price parameter will apply only for the trading day it was approved, but may be re-confirmed by the Floor Governor for subsequent trading sessions for the particular security on a day-by-day basis. Once a Floor Governor has established a special price parameter, a Floor Official must approve the publication on the tape of any trade that exceeds such parameter, except when Floor Governor approval is required under Rule 123A.40, as discussed below. Changes to the two point parameter must be reported to the Exchange's Market Surveillance Division by the Floor Governor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> NYSE Rule 79A.30. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NYSE Rule 123A.40 prohibits a specialist from trading for his own account in a stock in which he is registered if the trade would result in electing any stop order on his book, unless (i) his bid or offer has the effect of bettering the market, (ii) a Floor Official approves the transaction, and (iii) the stop order is guaranteed to be executed at the same price as the electing sale. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  While the above requirements would remain for transactions where the specialist's bid or offer results in the election of a stop order, under the proposal a specialist would be permitted to participate in a trade solely for the purpose of facilitating the completion of an order at a single price where the depth of the current public bid or offer (which would not be the specialist's bid or offer) is not sufficient to do so, without guaranteeing the execution price of any stop orders elected by the transaction and without obtaining Floor Official approval for each transaction. The proposal, however, requires a specialist to obtain the approval of a Floor Governor rather than a floor official as currently required, prior to engaging in a transaction for his own account at the electing sale price if a stop order will be elected (pursuant to the rule's conditions) and executed at a price outside the price parameters provided in NYSE Rule 79A.40. <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Stop orders are orders which become executable market or limit orders once the price specified on the order is reached in the market. if the order is an executable market order, it will be executed at the next best market price, which may not be the stop order (``electing'') price.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> note 4 and accompanying text. Should the two point price parameter provided in Rule 79A.30 be change for securities traded at $100 or over pursuant to the change to Rule 79A.30 being approved herein, that temporary price parameter will be the determining point for floor Governor approval pursuant to Rule 123A.40. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Discussion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements of Section 6(b) of the Act. <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  In particular, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the Section 6(b)(5) requirements that the rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts, and, in general, to protect investors and the public.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78f(b) (1988).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

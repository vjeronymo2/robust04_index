			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of Germany (30): Chrysalis of a Bank of Europe - Peter Norman explains the significance of Frankfurt's European Monetary Institute In spite of Germany's pivotal role in the European Union and Chancellor Helmut Kohl's passion for greater European integration, Germany is poorly endowed with EU institutions. The move of the European Monetary Institute to its new Frankfurt headquarters this month goes some way to redressing the balance. The EMI has been set up to prepare the planned European System of Central Banks (ESCB) which will be established if and when the EU fulfils the promises of the Maastricht Treaty and moves to the third and final stage of economic and monetary union, with a single currency and single monetary policy. Meanwhile, the institute exists to strengthen the co-ordination of monetary policy among the EU's 12 central banks and promote economic convergence among member States so they can meet the tough criteria which the treaty has prescribed for Emu membership. Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy, the EMI president, and about 75 staff have installed themselves in an imposing city centre tower block that was formerly the headquarters of the Bank fur Gemeinwirtschaft. Last week's meeting in the rechristened 'Eurotower' of the EMI's governing council, which comprises the EU central bank governors and Mr Lamfalussy, was a signal that the EU's newest institution had begun work in earnest after 10 months of preparation in borrowed office space provided by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) in Basle, Switzerland. Mr Lamfalussy, who moved from being general manager of the BIS to take over the EMI presidency at the start of this year, has described the EMI's first task as constructing a 'turnkey' central bank for Europe that is capable of operating effectively once the political decisions to go ahead with Emu have been taken. After much haggling, European leaders bowed to German wishes and agreed just over a year ago to site the EMI in Frankfurt. They also endorsed the 65 year old Belgian banker, academic and monetary policy expert as its head. At that time, there were many who wondered whether Mr Lamfalussy and the institute were being launched on a futile endeavour. The EU was still suffering the aftershocks of 18 months of monetary turbulence. These had seen the departure of the British pound and the Italian lira from the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System, numerous parity changes among surviving ERM currencies and a speculative run on the French franc in July and August 1993 that had culminated in the widening of the ERM's fluctuation margins to 15 per cent either side of its members' central rates. Since then, calm has returned to the ERM. The exchange rates of the surviving member currencies have stabilised at levels close to those that existed before August 1993. Interest rates in continental Europe have fallen and the region appears to be enjoying a broad based, non-inflationary economic recovery. According to Mr Lamfalussy, 'things are not as negative as they looked a year ago'. The way is clear for intensive work towards Emu, if not yet for the political decisions to take monetary union further. The institutional framework and operating principles of the planned European central bank system have been defined in the Maastricht Treaty. It has been left to the EMI to design its organisation in detail and specify the relations between the future European Central Bank (ECB) and the national central banks that will also be members of the ESCB. The EMI has to work out how the EU's future single monetary policy should be managed. It must also tackle such issues as the preparation of banknotes to be used after the introduction of the Ecu as a single European currency and how national payments systems should be linked. These may sound like dry technical matters. But as Mr Lamfalussy has observed: 'The veil of technicalities obscures important matters of interest to individual countries and market participants alike.' The nature of future monetary policy throws up several big issues involving differences of central bank practice that could result in tensions between such heavy-weight institutions as the Bundesbank and the Bank of England. The EMI will have to consider whether Europe's monetary policy should be guided by a money supply measure as in Germany or an inflation target as in Britain. If a monetary aggregate is chosen, which one should it be? Should commercial banks, as part of the management of policy, be obliged to deposit compulsory minimum reserves with the ESCB? If so, should these be interest bearing or not? Fostering central bank co-operation is the other part of the EMI's mandate. This task, which Mr Lamfalussy considers as important as preparing the central bank, will involve building up the EMI's economic research capacity. EU economics and finance ministers were given a foretaste of the EMI's ambitions in this area at an informal meeting of the EU's 'Ecofin council' at Lindau on Lake Constance in September. Mr Lamfalussy presented the findings of a penetrating EMI analysis that demonstrated how different levels of budget deficit, variations in currency volatility, and member states' widely varying inflation records explained why they had been impacted to varying degrees by this year's bond market turbulence. His presentation also served as a reminder to the ministers that Mr Lamfalussy is a believer in monetary union. He says its implementation is essential to protect what has been achieved in creating the European single market. However, he doubts whether Emu can be achieved by 1997 - the earliest date in the Maastricht Treaty. Emu and establishment of the ECB could take 'five, six or 10 years'. If so, the EMI, which is due to be closed down as soon as the ESCB starts operating, will turn out to be a more durable part of the Frankfurt financial scene than its designers envisaged. With a staff drawn from all EU countries (including Austria, one of the applicant countries), it should help bolster Frankfurt's credentials as an international financial centre and offset some of the shock generated by Deutsche Bank's recent decision to strengthen its investment banking presence in London. But the EMI's role will be judged ultimately by the performance of the central banking system that is due to supplant the institute, if and when Emu occurs. There is much to do before the EU achieves Emu along the lines envisaged in the Maastricht Treaty. The excessively high budget deficits and indebtedness of most EU member state must be reduced to credible and manageable proportions. Europe's politicians must generate the political will to move to stage three. Then there is the vexed question of achieving greater political union in the EU, which many economists, politicians and officials (notably in Germany) consider essential if Emu is to prove a lasting success. Speaking in Paris recently, Mr Lamfalussy acknowledged that much was beyond his capacity to deliver. 'Even if done well', he said, the EMI's preparations for Emu would 'not necessarily tip the scale of the political decision in favour of moving rapidly towards monetary union.' But he made clear that he and the EMI mean business. 'I shall do everything in my power to give no excuses to those who, on the pretext that preparation for the organisation of the European Central Bank is inadequate, wish to postpone the date of the political decision,' he said.</p>

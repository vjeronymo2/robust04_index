			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Premier Cons confirms talks over Pict stake A bid battle among Britain's independent oil exploration companies was signalled yesterday when Premier Consolidated Oilfields confirmed it was in discussions to buy a 48.3 per cent stake in Pict Petroleum, as part of a Pounds 80m full offer for its smaller rival. Premier is negotiating with Amerada Hess, the US oil and gas exploration group, to buy the shares it has held since 1987. As part of a possible deal, Amerada would trade its holding for a stake in Premier and subscribe for further shares to a maximum of 25 per cent. Last night, Mr John Lander, Pict managing director, said: 'We have been notified by Amerada Hess of their discussions with Premier, but as such we have not had any approach.' He refused to comment further on any ramifications of an offer from Premier. Premier said that any offer would be made on the basis of the group's relative share prices at the close of trading last Friday. Pict shares were then 141p, while Premier stood at 21 1/2 p. Premier added: 'Any offer for Pict is unlikely to value the company at a significant premium to that price.' Yesterday, Pict shares closed 14p up at 155p, valuing the company at Pounds 80m, while Premier shares finished 1 1/2 p up at 23p. Analysts said that at this level of valuation, an all-paper offer would probably involve about seven Premier shares for every one Pict, giving Amerada a stake of about 24 per cent in Premier. In the event of an offer, the US group would pay 30p a share to increase its stake to the 25 per cent ceiling. Mr Iain Reid, oil analyst at SG Warburg, said: 'At this price, this deal does not reflect the upside in Pict's drilling programme. We feel a more appropriate offer should be nearer the Pounds 2 a share level.'</p>

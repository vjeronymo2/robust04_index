			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Andrey Nikolayev report under the "Admission" rubric: </F> "Defense Ministry Will Approve Norms of Morals. Pavel Grachev  Officially Recognizes Military Trade Union"]    [Text] Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev and Mikhail  Kolchev, chairman of the Central Committee of the Independent  Trade Union of Servicemen of the Russian Federation [ITUS], have  signed an agreement on cooperation "in the name of reaching  understanding" on the basis of "respect for differing opinions."    The trade union has been in existence for two years but  throughout that time the Defense Ministry had not recognized it,  thereby, to all appearances, hindering the inception of a trade  union movement in the Armed Forces. The occasion for signing  the agreement, according to Vladimir Piskurev, ITUS Central  Committee deputy chairman, was provided by "optimal approaches  to the resolution of pressing problems elaborated of late in the  Army and the Navy." Thanks to these approaches the Defense  Ministry and the trade union have signed an agreement under  which both sides undertake to conduct joint work to form the  Russian Federation Armed Forces on a professional basis. They  have agreed to jointly solve questions connected with social  adaptation of citizens discharged from military service, and  with the construction of housing and training people in civilian  specialties. Joint work of the Defense Ministry and the ITUS  has been envisioned as opening new enterprises based on those  being converted to civilian uses, and the creation of insurance  guarantees and pensions for servicemen.    The sides have undertaken not to let the Army and the Navy  be  involved in political gambles, not to let sink the level of  defense capability and social protection for servicemen and  citizens discharged into the reserves or into retirement, nor  for their family members. The ITUS and the Defense Ministry  have agreed to jointly "revive the glorious traditions of  patronage links between military and work collectives, to spread  the spiritual traditions of the Russian Army and Navy," as well  as to uphold "the norms of moral behavior of servicemen in  public life."</p>

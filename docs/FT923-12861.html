			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Accountancy Column: Internal auditors in search of an authoritative role THERE WAS a good deal of head-scratching at a hotel in west London earlier this week, where the Institute of Internal Auditors was holding its latest conference. The underlying message was one of unjust neglect of their profession by the outside world. While accounting standards, auditing practices and the work of the accountancy firms dominates the news, internal auditors are barely noticed as they carry out essential functions for organisations and companies across the UK. Internal auditing is the process by which a special group of a company's employees work to help assure management that the business is achieving its objectives economically, effectively and efficiently; that financial and operating information is reliable; that laws, regulations and procedures are being complied with; and that the assets are safeguarded. While the external auditor typically spends a few weeks a year testing control systems and essentially building up a snapshot of the company's balance sheet, the internal auditor is submerged in its daily operations. If the neglect of the internal auditor was a matter of perception or professional pride alone, it might not much matter. But while in some cases the staff are not appreciated, the depressing fact is that the function itself - while so evidently vital - is often altogether absent. A survey of 1,185 quoted companies by the institute in conjunction with Aid to Industry last summer found that only 24 per cent had an internal audit function, and 23 per cent an internal audit committee. At the lower end, only 5 per cent of electronics companies had an internal audit function. Mr Roger Cheesley, a partner with Touche Ross, which is marketing a 'health check' service for companies to scrutinise their internal audit procedures, argues that many of the failures and frauds of recent months could have been prevented by an effective internal audit function. But he says: 'Surprisingly little attention is paid to internal audit.' Mr Andy Robertson, chairman of the institute's public affairs committee and an internal audit controller with a private company, contrasts the London meeting - which about 200 people attended - with an equivalent function in Arizona in the US which he attended recently. There were more than 1,500 delegates. He says the difference is explained by the slow development of the profession in the UK, the dominance and influence of the other accountancy bodies, and the fact that there remains no legislation to drive its expansion by requiring internal auditing to take place. Part of the problem has also been that, traditionally, internal auditing has had a reputation as a second-rate job. 'You used to place the accountants who couldn't do anything decent into the internal audit department,' says Mr Harold Izzard, a past president of the institute and now its spokesman on corporate governance. As a result, the staff were not always of the highest quality, turnover was high, and the results achieved were not necessarily the most impressive. The institute is keen to argue that things are beginning to change, however. It points proudly to nearly 4,000 members. It displays its code of professional ethics, and a series of guidelines and position statements. Perhaps most significantly, it stresses the fact that since 1990 full membership has only been available to those who pass its written examinations and gain relevant work experience over at least three years. They can then become either a Member of the Institute of Internal Auditors (MIIA), or obtain the specialist Qualification in Computer Auditing (QiCA). Mr Robertson says that while the recession may also be a factor, the growing status and more demanding nature of the role helps explain why his own company's internal audit department is now receiving a large number of job applications from chartered accountants - something that would never have happened even a few years ago. The status and importance of the profession has certainly grown as its influence has spread. The public sector has made far greater play of internal audit than the private sector, driven by legislation and public pressure for accountability. Other worries remain. There will always be tension for the internal auditor in identifying high-level fraud: it may require going to the managers involved; or to the external auditors who - according to Mr Izzard - often find such discoveries embarrassing. On a more practical level, Mr Cheesley says that the internal auditors are often used as 'fire-fighters' for the accounts department during periods of illness or high pressure. They provide back-up support to other functions within the business, at the expense of their own work. But he stresses that where internal audit is performed effectively, it is a vital complement to the work of the external auditor. It can provide reassurance, highlight areas of weakness, and prevent costly duplication of effort. 'The question is whether management is giving internal auditors an opportunity,' he says. As Mr Andrew Chambers, professor of internal auditing at the City University Business School in London, pointed out at the Institute's conference this week, there still appears to be little attempt to involve internal auditors in the wider debates about accountancy and corporate governance, and little discussion by other bodies of the issues it raises. One example of this neglect which Mr Chambers cites is the Cadbury report on the financial aspects of corporate governance, which has caused some irritation at the Institute. It was not invited to sit on the committee or to help sponsor its work. Mr Andy Robertson takes some comfort from the fact that it did participate in discussions. 'But we are still only mentioned in the notes at the back,' he says. This low-key role is reflected in the final conclusions made in the report. The institute made a submission when the committee first began operating a year ago. It is now on the point of submitting a detailed response to the draft. In contrast to most professional bodies, it launched a strong and immediate attack when the report was issued in late May. Mr Neil Cowan, the president elect, said at the time: 'Cadbury pays lip service to internal auditing. It doesn't give it any teeth.' He said that fraud was most likely to be detected by the internal auditor; that the chief internal auditor should have unimpeded access to the audit committee; and that all listed companies should be required to have an effective internal audit function. The Cadbury report does stress that 'an effective internal control system is an essential part of the efficient management of a company'. But there are no recommendations to reinforce this point. It talks about the importance of the audit committee, but it makes little play of the role of the internal auditor in providing information to that committee. As a result, it should come as no surprise that the institute criticised the report for taking a 'top-down' approach to corporate governance, and considering the issues from the perspective of the external auditor. Mr Izzard warns that, if the amended Cadbury report due out later this year does not include stronger recommendations on internal auditing, it will deal a powerful blow to the profession. 'Without internal audit, the audit committee is a bit of a farce,' he says. 'External auditors can only scratch the surface. Internal auditors constantly monitor controls and systems. They are in a prime position to identify problems.' 'External auditors can only scratch the surface. Internal auditors constantly monitor controls and systems. They are in a prime position to identify problems.'</p>

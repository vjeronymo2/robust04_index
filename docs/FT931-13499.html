			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Jobs top priority for new Copenhagen government POLICIES to generate more jobs and reduce Denmark's 11 per cent unemployment rate will be a top priority for the four-party, majority government which Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, the leader of the Social Democratic Party, will form over the weekend. The SDP leader yesterday received the consent of the three small centre parties - Radical Liberals, Centre Democrats and Christian People's Party - to form a coalition government on the basis of a policy document hammered out this week: 'A programme to engage, enthuse and call on the commitment of the people.' The new government will have the narrowest possible majority, 90 of the 179 seats in the Folketing, including the votes of two of the four members elected for the Faroe Islands and Greenland. Mr Rasmussen will spend the weekend putting together his cabinet. It is expected that his new government will be ready to be presented to Queen Margrethe on Monday. The three centre parties all supported the outgoing Conservative-Liberal coalition, which collapsed last week when Prime Minister Poul Schluter resigned after 10 years in office following criticism over the so-called Tamilgate scandal. Therefore, no radical changes in the policies of the new government are expected. Mr Rasmussen has also chosen to isolate the left-wing Socialist People's Party (SPP), whose leaders were hoping for a government resting on support from them, the SDP and the Radicals, another majority combination. 'The SDP has made a right turn,' said Mr Holger Nielsen, SPP leader. Low inflation, continued membership of the European Community's exchange rate mechanism, a cautious fiscal policy and a continued 'solid' surplus on the current external account are among the basic points in the government's programme. Its headline points are employment, renewal of the welfare state, the environment and improvement in human rights and democracy around the world.</p>

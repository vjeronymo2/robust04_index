			<p>Battery   Life   <F P=102> 94FE0228E Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 17 Aug 93 p  14 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY </F>  <F P=103> 94FE0228E </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN </F> <F P=105>  Japanese </F> CSO     [Text] The Kyushu Electric Research Institute has developed  a testing and evaluation system for EV (electric vehicle)  batteries and has started trying to extend the life of those  batteries, which it believes is one of the keys to the  widespread use of electric-powered vehicles.    The institute has devised a system whereby the life of an EV  battery can be tested and evaluated for actual road conditions  inside a laboratory. In this system, a battery is placed inside  the test equipment, and an external device is used to input  changes in accelerator pressure (discharge), temperature,  humidity, and vibrations for actual driving conditions in  Fukuoka City. The system can evaluate 30 different batteries  simultaneously, so it is a lot faster and much more labor-saving  than actual on-road testing. Battery makers do not as yet have  such a testing and evaluation system.    Lead batteries used to be used in electric vehicles, but  they  could only go about 70 km on a one recharge for in-city driving.  When a nickel-zinc battery is used, that figure goes as high as  140 km, but these batteries have a short lifetime and are twice  as expensive. If the life of a nickel-zinc battery could be  extended, it would mean that a new battery would not be needed  and that the total cost could be reduced, thereby making such a  battery more practical to use.    The institute wants to extend the life of existing 70-cycle  nickel-zinc batteries to 400 cycles, with one cycle being one  complete charge and discharge. Working from a 4-year plan that  starts this year, the institute has said it will investigate the  optimum configuration for the battery by changing the makeup of  the electrode plates and the electrolyte concentration in the  battery.</p>

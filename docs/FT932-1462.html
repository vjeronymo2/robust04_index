			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Survey of Spain, Banking and Finance (3): Focus is on rate trend - The Stock Market Madrid's Bolsa index is hovering around the 260 mark which means that the market has already put on the 20 per cent in value that at the begining of the year had been forecast for all of 1993. Spain, according to whichever securities house last offered its opinion, is ready for underweighting or ripe for a considered speculative buying. The first opinion requires little by way of explanation. Spain is in recession - the first quarter recorded a negative 0.5 per cent growth following one of 0.2 per cent in the last quarter of 1992 - and that is reason enough to give it a rest. The second option has the analysts mostly sidelining fundamentals and focusing on politics, or more exactly, on what the politicians, whoever they made be, will do about interest rates. Discussion on this will continue right through to mid-July and the investiture debate to elect a new prime minister. Such is the level of debate on government and on policies that the security houses seem to be employing more political pundits than business analysts and economic gurus. It is only after the debate next month that the markets will gain a clear notion of what government policies can be expected following the qualified victory of Mr Felipe Gonzalez's socialist party in the general elections on June 6. And what they will be looking for is the all-important interest rate trend. The central point is that the Madrid market appears to be driven more by interest rate movements than by industrial cycles. A recent report by Lehman Brothers on Bolsa strategy has been the latest to underline this and it notes that such a driving force is less surprising when the market constituents - chiefly banks and electrical utilities - are considered. Spain has not had what the UK, for example, would consider a proper recession for 30 years but it has had periods of slowdown of which the present period is arguably the most severe. The market has, however, tended to react more to rates and less to the slowdowns. This occured in 1975 in the 12 months that followed the bottoming-out of industrial production; interest rates rose and the market fell by 16.3 per cent. Midway through 1982, which was when the previous big slowdown reached a snail's pace, long rates remained broadly unchanged for 12 months and the market put on just 7.2 per cent. There was, true to form, a stampede to sell in the 48 hours that followed Mr Gonzalez's electoral win. A lot of market players had clearly betted on a triumph by the conservative opposition which is perceived to be much softer about defending the peseta. Later the Bolsa rallied and this was because it formed the opinion that Mr Gonzalez, who is short of an overall majority and in need of parliamentary allies, cannot in practice be as supportive over the currency as he would like. It is not that Mr Gonzalez does not want to cut rates. It is that he is not willing to risk any attacks on the peseta as a result of doing so. The prime minister's potential coalition partners will nevertheless press him to bump-start the economy whatever the feared consequences might be. Fuelling the rally is the market's perception that the prime minister's dilemma will be resolved for him by the Bundesbank. The consensus opinion is that Spanish rates will track the German ones and could lose between 150 and 200 basis points by early autumn. More bullish analysts suggest that this timing could be perfect for the Bolsa. The thinking is that the cuts will coincide with a series of social pacts, bringing together the government. This sanguine scenario, which naturally strengthens the lowered rate lobby, leans strongly on the prime minister's perceived leadership qualities. It depends on Mr Gonzalez putting together first, well before the summer break, a strong coalition government with clear, market-orientated ideas on the economic problems - from inflationary wage settlements to excessive government spending - that have been building up for far too many months. The speculative buying opinion thus sees a new rally in the final months of the year that could take the Bolsa index beyond the 270 level.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta, June 28 (AFP) -- Up to 21 people arrested  Monday during demonstrations protesting a government ban on  three weekly publications were to appear in Central Jakarta  district court Tuesday.    There will be three separate hearings for the demonstrators,  who include prominent poet Rendra, said court official Amir  Samsudin.    He said 29 demonstrators had been arrested but seven were  released immediately. One man, identified only as Viktor, was  detained for allegedly instigating the demonstration, and will  face trial later.    One of Rendra's relatives said the demonstrators had been  questioned without lawyers being present.    Rita Kalibonso, a lawyer with the country's leading human  rights group Legal Aid Foundation, said the 21 demonstrators  were considered to have committed minor offences under the law  and could be dealt with summarily.    They were likely to face charges either of refusing to  disperse despite repeated warnings by security officials, or  holding a mass gathering of more than five people without a  police permit. The offences carry maximum sentences of 18 weeks  and two-week jail terms respectively.    The government's decision last week to revoke the licences  of  three popular weekly publications TEMPO, EDITOR and DETIK which  had criticised a minister close to President Suharto has  triggered protests from several human rights groups, students,  journalists and artists.    On Monday hundreds of anti-riot police and military in  combat-fatigues and wearing black T-shirts with "Operation  Cleansing 1994" written on them, broke up the demonstrations.</p>

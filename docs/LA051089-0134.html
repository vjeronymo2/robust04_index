			<p><P> May 10, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BRADLEY TELLS CITY COUNCIL HE ERRED BUT BROKE NO LAW  </P> <P> Mayor Tom Bradley, in an extraordinary public admission, told a stunned City  Council today that he made "an error in judgment" in creating the appearance of  a conflict of interest between his personal finances and his mayoral actions,  but he insisted that he will be exonerated by pending investigations into his  behavior.  </P> <P> "I was insensitive not to realize that accepting outside employment can create  the perceptions we see today," said Bradley, making his comments under the  glare of a battery of television cameras in a hastily arranged appearance in  the council's ornate chamber.  </P> <P> "In retrospect, my decision to engage in outside employment was a mistake  because of the perceptions it created. I now recognize that error and will  always regret it.  </P> <P> "I am certain," the mayor added, "that the inquiry will conclude that I  violated no laws."  </P> <P> The two-minute public statement, which Bradley aides said the mayor had been  mulling over for a week, was meant to blunt the political damage mounting daily  because of the raft of investigations surrounding the mayor. Council members  were told of the pending statement less than half an hour before Bradley  delivered it, and the mayor refused to answer questions afterward.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Few Personal Words'  </P> <P> Afterward, the members, whose good will Bradley was clearly courting with what  he termed "a few personal words" about the controversy, expressed sharply mixed  reactions. Council members Robert Farrell and Joel Wachs rose in a standing  ovation as Bradley marched from the council chamber, but other influential  members discounted the mayor's address.  </P> <P> "I don't think it was clear enough; I don't think it was convincing enough,"  said Councilwoman Gloria Molina, a member of the council's Governmental  Operations Committee, which is overseeing City Atty. James K. Hahn's probe of  the mayor.  </P> <P> Councilman Mike Woo, who heads the committee, offered a similar assessment. "We  still need to find out what the facts are," he said.  </P> <P> Bradley faces four separate investigations into his conduct. Hahn's probe,  which is expected to continue for months, centers on Bradley's financial  relationships with two local institutions. The Far East National Bank last year  awarded Bradley $18,000 to serve as the only paid member of its advisory board.  The second firm, Valley Federal Savings &amp; Loan, had paid Bradley up to  $24,000 a year since 1978 to serve as a director.  </P> <P> Both were doing business with the city during the time they employed the mayor.  Bradley initially denied knowing of the connection, but documents released in  recent weeks have indicated that Bradley knew Far East held city accounts.  Bradley also voted on measures affecting Valley Federal subsidiaries before he  left the board earlier this year.  </P> <P> The mayor also faces probes by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the  Fair Political Practices Commission, which has launched two investigations of  the mayor.  </P> <P> In his admission of error, Bradley specifically apologized for accepting fees  from outside firms -- a practice that, as the mayor noted, is allowed under the  City Charter. He did not, however, address the central issue of the controversy  -- the allegations that Bradley improperly consulted with city officials  regarding the firms and took actions benefiting those who paid him fees.  </P> <P> Bradley's top aide, Deputy Mayor Mike Gage, said the omission was intentional.  </P> <P> "He considers the taking of outside employment to be his error in judgment  because of the perception that it created -- not because of his actions," Gage  said.  </P> <P> Gage said Bradley's decision to publicly address the matter came after much  deliberation, and acknowledged that, in the minds of some city officials, was  considered belated.  </P> <P> "I think any person has difficulty admitting they made an error of judgment,"  Gage said of the timing.  </P></p>

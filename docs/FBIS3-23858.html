			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Natalya Bespalova and Dmitriy Donskoy under the </F> rubric "Problem": "1904-1994: There Is No Drop in the Number of  Indigent in Russia; How Many of Them Are There Today--Nobody  Knows"]    [Text] No statistics are kept on homeless people in Moscow,  and therefore nobody knows their exact number. According to the  most approximate estimates of specialists, it is several tens of  thousands. In proportion to the total number of population of  Moscow, this figure is considerably higher than in most other  major Russian cities. An important transportation junction and  the center of a metropolitan area, the capital has always  attracted those for whom the song line "my address is not a  house and not a street" has become a harsh reality of life  rather than a romantic phrase.    One could get an indirect idea of the number of Moscow  homeless from information on how many of them are brought  annually to the only holding facility in the city, on  Novoslobodskaya Street. For almost five years now this number  has not dropped below 1,300. This is determined, however, not at  all by the number of Moscow homeless but first and foremost by  the capacity of the holding facility itself, which is precisely  this figure. An ordinary Moscow citizen, however, can draw only  one conclusion from his own observations: the number of beggars  and homeless on Moscow streets and underground crossings is  growing steadily from year to year. It is especially noticeable  in the winter. In the summer, free to move away from central  heating pipes and unlocked basements, the inhabitants of the  capital city's foul places fan out to Russian nooks and  crannies, only to return a few months later, in somewhat better  shape, to the capital for the winter. In that same Moscow  holding facility out-of-towners--a questionable definition as  applied to the homeless--account for 72 percent of its clients.    The state that once proclaimed the slogan "Everything in the  name of the people, everything for the good of the people" has  now found itself unable to pay even minimal attention to  vagrants. In 1991 Russia repealed the article in the criminal  code that stipulated a penalty for vagrancy and begging. A  democratic measure at first glance--each person is free to live  the lifestyle he desires--in reality it only worsened the  situation. Having stopped persecuting those who by all laws of  humanity need support rather than punishment, it has not offered  anything instead. A system of aid to those who have hit the  social bottom was never set up, and thousands of people who  found themselves not only below the poverty line but also  outside of normal human existence were now completely left to  their own devices.    Left unattended, the illness progressed rapidly, however,  and  in the end it became impossible to ignore it any longer. The  first to sound the alarm were Moscow health care practitioners.  Thousands of homeless that flooded the streets dramatically  exacerbated the health and hygiene situation in the capital and  became walking carriers of the most dangerous diseases. The  first case of cholera in Moscow in many years, in which the  disease turned out to be caused by local sources rather than  brought in from other regions, was diagnosed last year in a  homeless man. Research shows that each Moscow vagrant carries a  bouquet of five or six diseases. Almost 100 percent of homeless  suffer from pediculosis, or, to put it plainly, infestation with  lice. The same goes for tuberculosis. As early as the middle of  1992 a calculation was presented to the collegium of Russia's  Ministry of Health Care, according to which an estimated 40,000  homeless with an open form of tuberculosis were roaming the  country. The number of homeless in the country certainly has not  declined since then, and, in the opinion of physicians, this was  the main factor contributing to the fact that the curve of  incidence of tuberculosis in the country has headed sharply  upward.    Finally, the problem that had already become a plague of big  cities was noticed at the top. On 2 November 1993, Edict of the  President of Russia No. 1815 "On Measures of Prevention of  Vagrancy and Begging" was issued; a month later it was  duplicated by a Moscow Government decree of the same name. These  documents could have come out much earlier, but the fathers of  the nation, busy with important state affairs, fly on airplanes  and almost never happen to pass through a railway station, and  one cannot really see from the window of a government limousine  the horror that is taking place today in underground crossings  and around subway stations. However, whether even these belated  directives will be carried out is unclear. According to the  Government of Moscow decree, two branches of the holding  facility, each with the capacity to accommodate 80-100 persons,  are to be opened in Moscow before 1 March 1994. Despite the fact  that the deadline is approaching, however, the addresses of the  new institutions that are supposed to open their doors to the  Moscow homeless are still not known, and facilities have not  been allocated for them. Not everything has been worked out  regarding the creation of a system of social support for the  current inhabitants of the streets either.    The president's decree envisages the function of the militia  being limited to identifying, detaining, and bringing those  engaged in vagrancy and begging to centers of social  rehabilitation. There are no such centers as yet, and it is  envisaged setting them up on the basis of the same holding  facilities. The latter circumstance causes the greatest doubts  among MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] specialists: it is  unlikely that social protection service workers, who are  predominantly female and will replace militiamen, will be able  to handle easily the rather disagreeable population of the  holding facility. Especially considering that most current  homeless carry the luggage of an extensive criminal past. Among  those who passed through the Moscow holding facility in 1993,  66.4 percent had prior convictions, and among men this indicator  came close to the 100-percent mark. In addition, a check showed  that 108 persons, that is one in 13, were fugitives, with  criminal cases against them still open.    There is, however, a grain of utility in bringing social  services to work with the homeless. Because the problem of  people who have found themselves outside regular society is  first and foremost a social one, and the militia alone cannot  solve it. Holding facility workers who sent their wards for job  placement have more than once picked them up time and again in  the slums. It is hard for a person who has been a vagrant for  many years to start a new life from scratch, and many  deliberately choose the street again. But even for those who  want to get back to normal life, this is very difficult to  accomplish: one can fall out of it almost without noticing, but  it is practically impossible to get back.    The banal phrase that socioeconomic crisis always is  accompanied by impoverishment of the popular masses no longer  sounds banal when real human faces fill the background behind  the dry figures of declining production and gross national  product. And once again, like 100 years ago, today's outcasts  are digging into trash heaps, collecting alms in chewed-up caps,  drinking moonshine, and sleeping on street cobblestones.  Homeless Russia, the Russia of slums and gateways, of trash  containers and people dying at rail stations, has already become  the mirror of the Russia of limousines, casinos, and gold  Rolexes. Both were born in front of our very eyes. But which one  should we call the new Russia?</p>

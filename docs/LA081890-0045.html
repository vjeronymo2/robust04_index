			<p><P> August 18, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEWS;  </P> <P> THE TEXAS TORNADOS BLOW INTO PALOMINO  </P> <P> True to their name, the Texas Tornados filled the Palomino with a lot of hot  air on Thursday. Also a stream of corny country, Mexican polkas, slow and fast  R&amp;B, '60s pop hits, demented Lone Star psychedelia, hybrids of all of the  above and, as ringmaster Doug Sahm might put it, good vibes.  </P> <P> Sahm, his longtime cohort Augie Meyers, Chicano country singer Freddy Fender  and the great conjunto accordionist Flaco Jimenez comprise the Tornados, a San  Antonio semi-supergroup in the vein of country's Highwaymen and rock's  Traveling Wilburys.  </P> <P> It looks like a good way to get some idle careers back in gear, and it made  much more sense in a sweaty nightclub than it does on their new album, where  the music is often pedestrian and regressive. At the Palomino, the frolicsome  foursome, supplemented by four other players, kept it loose and spirited.  </P> <P> They know more about personality than pacing, and they haven't quite figured  out whose solo comes next, but between Fender's couple of hits ("Wasted Days  and Wasted Nights," "Before the Next Teardrop Falls"), Sahm's Sir Douglas  Quintet chestnuts ("She's About a Mover," "Mendocino") and Jimenez's explosive  workouts, plus an encore version of the legendary Roky Erickson's "You're Gonna  Miss Me" and visits from Harry Dean Stanton and Los Lobos' Cesar Rosas, they  kept the heat on. Pretty good for guys hovering around 50.  </P> <P> The hot air? Frequent bursts of self-congratulation for playing "real" music,  and regular breaks for record-biz chatter ("The single didn't chart, but the  album's going crazy," Fender reported, as if heading a promotion meeting). Kind  of blew the vibes. The Tornados and opening act Kelly Willis appear on Monday  at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano. RICHARD CROMELIN  </P></p>

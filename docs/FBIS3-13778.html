			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 20 Mar (MENA)--Dr. Nabil Najm, Iraqi  permanent delegate to the Arab League, has stated that  yesterday's renewal of sanctions on Iraq will have a tremendous  effect on the Iraqi people and will cause more deaths among the  Iraqi women, children, and patients.    In a statement here today, Dr. Najm described this step as  one that "will not help stability in the region" and denounced  what he called "the double standards adopted by the Security  Council on Arab issues."    The Iraqi delegate denied that Iraq had proposed to swap  some  Kuwaiti detainees with some Iraqi defendants detained in Kuwaiti  prisons on charges of attempting to assassinate former U.S.  President George Bush. He added that this is completely untrue  because Iraq has no Kuwaiti detainees.</p>

			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / The Markets: Financing the upgrade to a high-wage-growth economy - Economic Eye The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is not known for its publicity-seeking ways. Strong titles, racy language, bold conclusions - none of these are house-style at the industrialised countries' Paris-based think tank. Yet, despite the usual diplomatic language and veiled prescriptions, a clear message shines through the OECD's draft report on employment and unemployment. The study, currently circulating among member governments, criticises continental European governments for their poor records of job creation and high long-term unemployment. But the OECD does not believe that the deregulated Anglo-American labour markets are the answer. Far from it. The collapse in the demand for unskilled workers in developed economies, the draft report says, is a serious problem 'regardless of the form it takes - low paid, low quality jobs or overt unemployment'. Less regulation may mean more low-wage, low-productivity employment. But the side-effects of America's hire-and-fire labour markets - rising wage inequality and in-work poverty as well as male inactivity - are as economically and socially dangerous as the long-term unemployment they are supposed to avoid. The only sustainable, and affordable, solution is to reverse the dwindling ability of most developed economies - with the exception of Japan and perhaps western Germany - to create high-wage, high-skill jobs and equip poorly educated workers to compete for them. What the OECD is not willing to do, however, is to ask whether the free market policies pursued by the UK government or deeply embedded in the structure of the American economy also explain why they have comparatively low levels of investment in physical and human capital. Last year's OECD Employment Outlook, for example, published research which finds a strong link between security of employment tenure and the willingness of both workers and managers to invest in training. But, while the draft report makes many suggestions for increasing the quality of education and removing obstacles to job creation, it does not tackle the question of whether flexible hiring and firing necessarily undermines long-term relationships and thus investment in skills. Again, with a clear nod in an Anglo-American direction, the report suggests that 'investment levels are too low in many OECD countries to provide the capital stock necessary to generate sufficient numbers of high-productivity jobs.' But perhaps the low levels of investment in the UK and US are linked to the structure of Anglo-American financial systems, and the fluid relationships between managers, shareholders, banks and other stakeholders that they encourage. The OECD's desire to duck these issues is understandable - international comparisons of financial systems are fraught with difficulties. Identifying differences in corporate governance across country is comparatively easy: US and UK companies have few intercorporate or bank equity holdings, while the takeover threat means incumbent managers must focus on short-term results; German and Japanese companies are less vulnerable to takeovers because of cross-shareholdings while management decisions are supervised by committees on which banks play a leading role. Yet the standard complaint from UK companies - that they do not have the same level of access to long-term bank finance as their German or Japanese competitors - is not borne out by the evidence. Oxford University economists Jenny Corbett and Tim Jenkinson have identified the net sources of funds available for physical investment over the period 1970-1989 after adjusting for bank deposits and purchases of bonds and equities. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, their research finds that internally generated profits are by far the main source of funds for investment in all four countries, as the charts show. US and UK companies actually depend more on bank finance than German companies. But market capital - bonds and equities - provides a small and dwindling net source of finance. For British companies, the development of the takeover market means that equity finance has increasingly become a net drain on resources. Yet financial systems clearly make a difference to the time horizons over which managers and workers can plan. The pattern of UK investment is much less stable than in Germany, in part because of Britain's recent macroeconomic turbulent history, as the charts show. But the share of bank finance in UK investment also fluctuates markedly, rising when investment increases but then falling sharply in recessions as the profitability of lending falls and banks call in their loans. In Germany, by contrast, the banks' role as actual and proxy shareholders in the companies they lend to seems to deliver much more dependable bank finance. The ability of German and Japanese stakeholders - workers, managers and shareholders - to take a longer term view and forgo earnings to invest for the future must also be part of the reason why profits and thus investment are consistently higher than in the US or UK. Who can blame British managers or workers for trying to extract as much as possible as fast as they can from the companies in which they work when the threat of takeover, recession or bankruptcy remains so immediate? The OECD is right of course, to counsel against easy solutions to unemployment. The long-term challenge of tackling unemployment, and creating more high-wage jobs, is not easily understood, let alone solved. But finding corporate structures which encourage managers, workers and bankers to take a longer-term view must be part of that solution. The OECD's decision not to explore how differences in corporate governance affect wages, profits and investment leaves a gap which needs to be filled.</p>

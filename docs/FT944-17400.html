			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Middle England's malaise: The despondency undermining Tory support Mr Mike Bawden, a long-serving conservative councillor in Swindon, is not a melodramatic man. But as he surveys middle England this autumn, his verdict is that something strange is afoot. 'The government has a big problem,' he admits. 'All the yardsticks by which we used to measure the economy have changed, and people just don't feel wealthy or good any more.' The failure of the feelgood factor to return with economic growth is troubling the Conservative party as it assembles for its conference next week. An internal inquiry has been launched into the government's low popularity, led by Mr John Maples, one of the party's deputy chairmen. He insists the despondency will lessen in time. But two years into the recovery, the message from Swindon is not simply that the feelgood factor is elusive but that there is little likelihood of a rapid change in mood. On paper, Swindon is a manufacturing success story. In the late 1980s, the local economy grew fast as companies such as Honda, the Japanese car maker, opened factories locally. Growth faltered with the recession in the early 1990s, but its economy is expanding again. Unemployment, which rose from 4 per cent in the late 1980s to 9 per cent in 1992, has fallen back to 6 per cent. The town's retailers detect modest sales growth. And 10,000 homes are being built in what will be Europe's largest private sector housing development. But, says Mr Geoff Teather, editor of the Swindon Evening Advertiser, 'nobody is really thanking the government'. Tax increases such as the imposition of Value Added Tax on domestic power have been introduced gradually, adding to consumer uncertainty. But, says Mr Bawden, the housing market is the real culprit for Middle England's malaise. Flat house prices have not only left the town with myriad tales of negative equity but have also forced many middle class residents to re-evaluate financial strategies. For example, David, a 36-year-old project planner, bought a house five years ago for Pounds 140,000. He tried, and failed, to sell it for about Pounds 120,000 last year. 'In the 1980s, people like me thought if we had spare cash we had to get on the housing ladder and keep borrowing and moving up. But now that's ended. We have had to look at our salary again and think a lot harder about saving.' Few people expect an early end to this malaise. Mr Russell Cleverley, of developers Hannick, says that although the market picked up at the start of the year, it has stalled again. He blames the end of fixed rate mortgages, a crucial marketing tool in a time of low economic confidence. 'I was thinking of buying a place for my children, but I won't now they have withdrawn the fixed rate.' There is no shortage of jobs locally. Indeed Mr Andy Cable, of the Response Management mail order group, says he has recruitment problems as he prepares for Christmas demand. But the part-time, flexible jobs he is offering have only limited appeal. 'You can get temporary jobs, but there is really not much proper stuff around,' says Miss Ann Whitfield, who recently found a job as a receptionist. Few people in Swindon are yet predicting that the three Conservative MPs in the area will be ousted at the next election. But as Mr Teather of the Swindon Evening Advertiser observes: 'Labour is re-emerging just as these economic changes are happening. Mr Tony Blair must be hoping that people in Swindon could turn out to be his children of tomorrow.'</p>

			<p><P> July 26, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> TECHNICAL FLAWS DELAY INTRODUCTION OF IBM PRODUCT  </P> <P> International Business Machines Corp. suffered an embarrassing setback today  when it announced that technical difficulties had forced it to cancel the  introduction of an important new disk-storage product for its mainframe  computers.  </P> <P> IBM shares were off $1.625 to $111.125 as investors worried that the delay in  the new unit would cause short-term earnings to suffer. Sales of the device had  been expected to reach $1.5 billion in 1990.  </P> <P> Announcement of the new product, which had been scheduled Tuesday, was canceled  at the last minute after the computer manufacturer said tests had revealed  problems. The company gave no indication of when the disk drives would be  available.  </P></p>

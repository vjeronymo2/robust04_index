			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial from the 9 June issue of PASASON: </F> "Wholeheartedly Welcome the Chairman of the State Law and Order  Restoration Council of the Union of Myanmar"]    [Text] Today, all Lao people and Vientiane residents are  very pleased and greatly honored to welcome His Excellency  [H.E.] General Than Shwe, chairman of the State Law and Order  Restoration Council [SLORC] of the Union of Myanmar [Burma], and  his delegation who are paying an official visit to the Lao  People's Democratic Republic [LPDR] from 9 to 13 June at the  invitation of H.E. Nouhak Phoumsavan, president of the LPDR.    The official visit to the LPDR by H.E. the SLORC chairman  and  his party takes place after an exchange of a series of visits by  the delegations at various levels from the two countries, for  instance the friendship visit to the Union of Myanmar by H.E.  Prime Minister Khamtai Siphandon in late February 1992, which  ended in glorious success, thus becoming an important step in  the development and strengthening of the relations of friendship  and cooperation between the two countries. Therefore, this  visit -- the first foreign visit by H.E. Gen. Than Shwe in his  capacity as SLORC chairman of the Union of Myanmar -- is  regarded as a great honor for the LPDR. It is also an event of  great significance in the history of the long-standing fine  relations of friendship and good neighborliness between Laos and  Myanmar. The visit will enable the peoples of the two countries  to understand one another more profoundly, thereby contributing  to further enhancing the relations of friendship and cooperation  in various fields between the two countries; to more fruitfully  benefitting the Lao and Myanmar peoples; and to building peace,  stability, and cooperation for development in Southeast Asia and  the world.    Laos and Myanmar have maintained fine and friendly relations  over a long period of time. Our two peoples admire and respect  one another and sincerely aspire to further strengthen our  mutual cooperation and ties. In recent years, an exchange of  visits by high-level delegations of the two countries has  successively been conducted, acting as an important factor for  gradually enhancing relations and cooperation in various fields.  The peoples of Laos and Myanmar living along our common border  regularly visit one another. Cross-border trade is also  increasingly flourishing. The close brotherly relations have  been distinctively displayed in the recent speedy demarcation of  the common border between the two countries. An agreement will  be signed on this during the visit. This important event will  become an excellent model for all nations who are trying to  solve historical border problems.    On this occasion, we, the Lao people, would like to express  our sincere thanks to the people of Myanmar for rendering  material and moral assistance to us in combating natural  calamities in recent years. We wish the Myanmar people more  glorious achievements and prosperity in developing and building  their own country. We wish the SLORC chairman and his  delegation brilliant success in paying this friendship visit to  Laos, thereby contributing to making more fruitful the existing  traditional fine relations of friendship and cooperation between  Laos and Myanmar and bringing more practical benefits to the two  peoples in the future.</p>

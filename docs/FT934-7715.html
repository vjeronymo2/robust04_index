			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China 3): The meteoric rise of Zhu Rongji - Tony Walker profiles the movers and shakers in China's economy FOR Zhu Rongji, China's senior vice-premier in charge of the economy, 'uneasily sits the crown,' as the saying goes. The reformist Mr Zhu, who introduced a 16-point austerity programme mid-year, has entered some rough water after offending powerful vested interests in the state sector with his attempts to impose stricter financial discipline. But the 65-year-old electrical engineer is unlikely to be fazed by criticism if he believes he is on the right track. A native of Changsha in Hunan province close to the birthplace of Mao Zedong, Mr Zhu is known for a stubborn streak, and a willingness to take risks. He has also experienced ups and downs in a bureaucratic career that began in 1951 as an official involved in central planning after graduating from Beijing's prestigious Qinghua University. In the late 1950s, Mr Zhu's career went into eclipse after he joined criticism of the system in the 'Hundred Flowers' campaign of 1957. During his years in the doldrums, which included a stint in the countryside for 're-education' during the Cultural Revolution, Mr Zhu remained nominally a deputy division chief of the State Planning Commission from 1952-1975. In the last years of the Cultural Revolution he was transferred to the Ministry of Petroleum. Then in 1978, the year that Mr Deng Xiaoping, launched his economic revolution, Mr Zhu became director of the Industrial Economics Institute attached to the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, an important Dengist 'think tank.' There followed jobs with the State Economic Commission, president of the Economic Management Institute affiliated with his alma mater, Qinghua University, deputy Party-Secretary of Shanghai in 1987, and mayor in 1988. The bold Mr Zhu earned a reputation for getting things done as mayor of the China's largest city: he was known as 'one chop' Zhu - a reference to the seal used by Chinese bureaucrats to signal approval. In recognition of his sterling efforts in Shanghai, Mr Zhu was transferred to Beijing as a vice-premier in 1991, elevated to the seven member standing committee of China's ruling politburo in 1992, made senior vice-premier in charge of the economy in March this year, and concurrently People's Bank governor in mid-year. By any standards, it has been a meteoric rise, and has, inevitably, aroused jealousies. LOU JIWEI, THE IDEAS MAN AMONG Mr Zhu Rongji's core group of close advisers a key figure is Lou Jiwei, director of the Macroeconomic Department of the Commission for Restructuring the Economy. While, the 42-year-old Mr Lou's substantive position is with the Restructuring Commission, his more important role is that of 'ideas man' in the Zhu kitchen cabinet dealing with economic issues. Indeed, he is credited with a vital part in formulating the 16-point stabilisation programme of mid-year. The representative of an international lending institution says of Mr Lou that he is 'very influential' and 'liberal minded'. Like Mr Zhu, Mr Lou is a graduate of Qinghua university - he graduated in computer engineering - and, among his more recent tasks, he was head of the Shanghai Commission for Restructuring the Economy. This was during the period when Mr Zhu was mayor. ZHU XIAOHUA, YOUTHFUL ADVISER ZHU XIAOHUA, the new deputy governor of the People's Bank, China's Central Bank, is another of Mr Zhu Rongji's youthful advisers, and like Mr Lou Jiwei, these connections stem from associations formed in Shanghai in the late 1980s. The 44-year-old Mr Zhu served as vice-president of the People's Bank's Shanghai headquarters from 1987-1990. This was during Zhu Rongji's term as mayor. A graduate of the Shanghai Institute of Finance, Mr Zhu Xiaohua was seconded to the International Monetary Fund from 1991-92. He returned to be deputy director of the economic section of Xinhua newsagency in Hong Kong before his appointment to the People's Bank in July. The Xinhua offices in Hong Kong are China's unofficial headquarters in the colony, and officials placed there are effectively Beijing's senior diplomatic representatives. Mr Zhu, described by a Chinese economist as 'smart,' is a native of Zhejiang province, south of Shanghai. LI JIANGE HAS A CRUCIAL ROLE LI JIANGE has the least public face of Mr Zhu's close staff, but according to a Chinese economist familiar with the workings of the vice-premier's office, Mr Li plays a crucial role as a personal assistant and speech-writer. Mr Li, who is in his forties. has worked in recent years in the State Council's Development Research Centre, the Cabinet 'think tank,' and in the State Planning Commission. His substantive position is deputy director of the law and policy department of the Economic and Trade Commission, but he spends almost no time there these days. A Western economist describes Mr Li as 'clear-headed.' He is tipped for bigger and better things. ZOU JIAHUA: WIDE CONNECTIONS ZOU JIAHUA, the third ranking vice-premier among five behind Premier Li Peng and Mr Zhu Rongji, appears to have seen his influence diminished recently; but with his wide Party and bureaucratic connections his present lack of prominence may be temporary. The 67-year-old Mr Zou, is married to the adopted daughter of the late Marshal Ye Jianying, one of the heroes of the Communist revolution, and is a son of Zou Taofen, a famous intellectual and journalist from the Shanghai of the 1930s. His responsibilities include industry and the State Planning Commission which is seen as a haven for officials antipathetic to Mr Zhu's reformist zeal. But the Shanghai-born Mr Zou himself is regarded as a moderate with liberalising tendencies. His long experience in the Chinese bureaucracy includes stints as Minister of Machinery and Electronics and director of the State Planning Commission. Born in Shanghai, Mr Zou was trained as an engineer in the Soviet Union between 1948-55. He is fluent in Russian and speaks some English. LI LANQING'S STAR IS RISING THE fifth-ranking vice-premier, Li Lanqing is one of China's more impressive officials whose star appears to be rising. The urbane Mr Li, 61, has overall responsibility for foreign trade and education. Among his more important tasks is selling China to the outside world. He is frequently charged with the task of receiving foreign visitors. In his previous role as Minister of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade (Mofert), he travelled widely. He speaks passable English. Much of his experience has been in the automotive sector. A graduate in enterprise management from Shanghai's prestigious Fudan University, he was trained at automotive plants in the Soviet Union in the 1950s. Mr Li was appointed vice-premier in March. According to Chinese insiders he fought a successful rearguard action to stop the powerful Trade Ministry (now called the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation - Moftec) from being dismembered. WU YI: 'A SMART, TOUGH BARGAINER' THE 55-year-old head of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation (Moftec), Wu Yi may not be the highest-ranking female in the hierarchy, but her 'trade minister' role gives her the most prominence. Appointed minister in March this year, Ms Wu is regarded as one of the younger breed of officials more likely to succeed. She first came to international notice when negotiating trade agreements with the US. Her opposite number, Carla Hills - the US special trade representative - said of her negotiating partner that she was a 'smart and tough bargainer.' Trained as a petroleum engineer in Beijing, Ms Wu spent 25 years in the petroleum industry, most of them working in refineries. A Xinhua dispatch listed her hobbies as tennis, golf, angling and reading - Tolstoy, Hugo and Balzac. Ms Wu is unmarried.</p>

			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Markets Report: D-Mark gains in spite of continuing US recovery The D-Mark gained yesterday against the dollar in spite of economic data signalling a continuation of the strong US recovery, write Peter Marsh and Emma Tucker. The French franc was also moderately strong against other important currencies, rounding off a helter-skelter year for the French currency. In thin holiday trading, the dollar found few buyers, in spite of data indicating durable goods orders rose 2 per cent in November, above market forecasts. After hitting DM1.693 in European trading, the dollar rallied slightly by the close but only to DM1.6935, down nearly a pfennig from the previous finish. In New York it also ended at DM1.6935. The franc was steady against the D-Mark as French Economy Minister Edmond Alphandery told a news conference that the government would not hesitate to take further steps to help stimulate growth, if that were necessary. The French franc ended last night little changed against the German currency at FFr3.406. In other parts of Europe, the Austrian central bank announced a cut in its GOMEX money market intervention rate of 10 basis points to 5.6 per cent from December 27, while the National Bank of Greece said the bank would reduce its deposit rate by 1 percentage point to 16 per cent in the next few days. There were few buyers for sterling as dealers, reluctant to take positions over Christmas, quoted prices defensively. In spite of this, the pound held firm against the D-Mark in late European trading, and gained against a generally weaker dollar to break through the psychologically important Dollars 1.50 barrier. It closed in London up  1/4 pfennig at DM2.5475, with analysts yesterday predicting that at least in the short term there was little upside left for the pound. Against the dollar it finished at Dollars 1.5040, after the previous day's Dollars 1.4950. The Bank of England announced that from January 20 it would introduce a new permanent sale and repurchase agreement, or repo, to relieve money market shortages. The move to the permanent repo still depends on consultations currently under way with banks and building societies, but follows on from the special facilities that were originally required after Black Wednesday last year to help offset the exceptionally large money market shortages that arose from the settlement of official foreign exchange transactions. In the meantime, the Bank said it would offer temporary facilities to take effect from January 5, maturing on January 20, to replace the outstanding January 5 maturing repo. On the money markets, the overnight rate slipped as low as 3 1/2 per cent, as a Pounds 1.5bn shortage was easily removed. The March short-sterling contract moved about 5 basis points higher to close at around 94.82 and the three-month interbank rate ended the day at 5 3/8 per cent.</p>

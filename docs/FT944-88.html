			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / The future revealed: read all about it]: Six analysts study the prospects for international markets in 1995 Tomorrow marks the start of a new year. What will it hold for investors  - prosperity or another dose of financial gloom? Will 1995 be, for instance: The year in which the dollar dies? The year when investors begin to take Russia seriously as the cheapest of the emerging markets? The year of the corporate merger? Those are just three of the predictions from our panel of forecasters: two fund managers, two conventional strategists, one technical analyst and a stock market historian. We asked each to guess the end-1995 level for a number of stock market indices and several key rates. All expect US and UK interest rates to rise over the year, but those who expect only a minor up-tick in UK inflation also expect only a minor rise in UK base rates. And although some are predicting further falls in gilts, no one expects another massive setback. All are predicting a recovery in UK equities, with the Footsie finishing anywhere between 3,200 and 3,700. Recoveries in the Japanese stock market and emerging markets are also common ground - although, again, views on the extent differ. The hardest market to call has been Wall Street, perhaps because it has shown such puzzling stamina in 1994. Their predictions are summarised on page 4. Michael Hart, the chairman of investment management group Foreign &amp; Colonial, is modestly optimistic about most markets. He says: Probably the most important factor of all is what happens to the US economy. My belief is that the high real interest rates experienced for some time now, and the rises likely in the next month or so, will slow down the economy by mid-year. The dollar should have a better year. Inflation will be the key. Valuations are not too demanding if investors can look forward to steady economic growth, low inflation, stable interest rates and improving corporate profits. A recession is unlikely until mid-1996 at the earliest. The stock market has not been down in a pre-election year for 55 years. The forecast of a 10 per cent rise for the UK market is based on the belief that growth is likely to slow and interest rates will not be forced up to panic levels by either internal or external forces. The outlook for corporate profits and dividends remains good as the benefit of higher volumes and productivity improvements come through. The market is cheap on current estimates of 1995 and 1996 earnings, although the Conservative party's prospects appear bleak and a Labour government probably has not been fully discounted. The reasons for assuming that the Japanese market will rise are: 1. The economy is steadily recovering and growth in 1995 is expected to be ahead of that for 1994. 2. Profits are also recovering: 25 per cent increases are possible in the manufacturing sector. 3. Inflation should remain low; thus, there should be no particular pressure on long-term bond rates. 4. Imports are now growing strongly, which should help to stabilise the yen and avoid trade friction with the US. 5. There are also some signs that Japanese institutions are beginning to commit money into the market. My forecast of a rise of more than 20 per cent for emerging markets is based on Europe and Japan stepping up imports, and an eventual slowdown in the US. Most of these markets are expected to perform well, but the most compelling valuations are to be found in Latin America. 1995 will be the year when investors began to take Russia seriously as the cheapest of the emerging markets. David Rough, Legal &amp; General group director (investments), is the other fund manager on our panel. He is more worried about the possibility of a hard landing in the US than Hart, but remarkably sanguine about the medium-term outlook for the UK. He says: Expect a further monetary tightening around the world as governments seek to curb any emerging signs of a pick-up in inflation. With the UK in the vanguard of recovery, domestic interest rates have bottomed already and begun the move upwards. But even with further interest rate increases in prospect, the UK can continue to expect steady growth through to the end of the century without a damaging rise in inflation. US inflation is more of a worry, even though US interest rates started to move upwards many months earlier than in the UK. Consequently, the continuing risk of a hard landing in the US is significantly depressing all world markets. The Japanese economy is more reassuring with a pick-up in growth expected following recent sluggishness. Continued acceleration by the German economy could weaken the recovery of the rest of Europe but the UK will be largely insulated from the impact of any German rate rises because our recovery is already well-established. The emerging economies are, therefore, the most likely to suffer from any further rises in US interest rates or a slowdown in US growth rates. The 1994 crash in world bond markets probably went too far. Although it may be too early yet to predict a bull market in bonds, it looks as if the worst has been seen already. But, overall, we still prefer equities to bonds. 1995 will be remembered as the year of the corporate merger, with major deals across many industrial and financial sectors. Michael Hughes, head of global economics and investment strategy at BZW, is the more optimistic of our two strategists and expects anyone with an internationally diversified portfolio to make a modest but real capital gain in 1995. He says: Economies rather than markets won the competition for funds in 1994. Liquidity was the key factor. The global recovery strengthened but sapped the available savings, with the result that markets fell. Although this shake-out has improved the valuations of many markets, few would appear to offer exceptional value. The UK is not one of them, although we feel that the equity market will benefit from the strengthening dollar and exposure to economic recovery in Europe. Corporate mergers and acquisitions could also propel prices. Higher domestic UK interest rates will, however, limit the adjustment of gilt yields despite an improving budget deficit. Most progress during the early months may be concentrated on Japan, where the economic recovery at least appears to be materialising as the yen falls. But this will take time, so the expected improvement in Japanese equities should be reasonable rather than exceptional. The recovery in Europe seems likely to gain momentum but, in the Anglo markets, the peak of the economic growth cycle may have been achieved by the end of 1994. Judging the timing and degree of the economic slowdown, should, therefore, take over as a market pre-occupation. We do not fear huge inflationary pressures at the consumer level. We are looking for a peak US inflation rate of 4 per cent, which would suggest that Fed funds may need to reach 7 per cent. For the year ahead, we would expect a global balanced fund to gain by around 12 per cent, which is modest by comparison with the exceptional period in the late '80s but very respectable against the background of 4 per cent inflation. This will be remembered as the year . . . when the Franc fort policy tying the French franc with the DM is deemed no longer to be feasible nor desirable. Nicholas Knight, deputy managing director of Nomura Research, was outstandingly bullish a year ago. Now, he is outstandingly cautious. He says: Stop-go-stop is likely to be the UK government's tactics for 1995 through 1997. This prognosis is not good for financial markets. Tight fiscal policy and higher base rates in 1995 will kill growth faster than currently expected, and cause downward revisions to corporate earnings estimates. Gilts will take no comfort; fear of a big pre-election bribe, therefore, could force gilt yields higher even if inflation remains low in the short term. In these circumstances, the equity market looks vulnerable, especially in the first half. If 1995 is indeed a 'slowdown' year in a cyclical context, valuations are still dangerously high. With UK institutions more interested in gilts, retail investors more interested in cash and overseas investors returning home, buy-backs and bids will be insufficient to drive the market dramatically higher. Indeed, it could go lower, perhaps, if international influences are as negative as we think. Higher short rates in the US, therefore, may spark a consolidation phase for the US equity market as money flees to the safety of cash deposits. Such has been the flood of American money overseas in recent times that all equity markets, not just the Dow, will feel the draught. 1995 will be remembered as the year when cyclical optimism about budget deficits gave way to secular pessimism. Robin Griffiths, technical analyst at research house James Capel, who warns that he only makes year-end forecasts for fun, expects world markets to touch bottom late in February, roughly a year after they peaked. He says: The trend for the current year has been negative for bonds and equities all around the world, and this will continue into the new year. Our models indicate a low in late February to early March. We could see the FT-SE 100 at 2,680 by then. The US Dow might get to 3,200. But unless a depression starts - there is a risk, but we bet against it - the rest of the year should see earnings recover and stocks rise. If that is accompanied with inflation, then equities rise a lot. This year's down-trends will continue to late February 1995. Then, we get a positive reversal. By then, the US Fed will have raised rates enough to have cooled the economy without killing it and the growth in earnings will then be able to drive equities ahead. Later, the dollar will end its rally and become weak. The dollar has actually been in a down-trend for 25 years but has still been thought of as the main reserve currency. During this year, it will be downgraded and no longer used as the dominant unit of account. The yen will dominate the Pacific region and the D-mark or Ecu will dominate Europe. This is the year in which the dollar will die. David Schwartz, a stockmarket historian, is a one-man band - unlike the rest of our panel. He says: The critical issue that will drive stock market prices up is the next US presidential election, due in 1996. The year preceding an election has been a constant winner for UK shareholders since 1951. The average pre-election year profit was over 20 per cent. Because the stock market anticipates the real economy, it is good to own shares in the preceding calendar year. Since 25 per cent of all FT-SE 100 company profits emanate from the US, UK investors benefit from this US domestic issue. 1995 will be remembered as the year the UK stock market scaled a 'wall of worry'.</p>

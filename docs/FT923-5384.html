			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Letter: Selling Czechoslovak privatisation short Sir, Before dismissing the progress made in Czechoslovakia (Leaders, 'No free lunch', August 21) there are a number of matters you should consider. Mass privatisation has been implemented this year against the background of economic stability and the rule of law. Reforms to this end have been effective but painful, with living standards dropping by more than 10 per cent. This is certainly no 'free lunch'. Privatisation gained political acceptability through relentless promotion by domestic politicians, including its champion, Mr Vaclav Klaus. I agree that some promises made by fund managers to attract the vouchers of citizens cannot be met. This may well undermine the confidence of the population in fund managers, but not in the whole system of mass privatisation. Yet fund managers triggered the correct conviction among people that the vouchers represented value - albeit not as great as some operators suggested. And some 8.5m citizens, almost 80 per cent of those eligible, participated. It is true that most fund managers are not experienced - the fund managed by our group is the largest foreign operator, the sixth largest in the Czech Republic - and initial confusion was inevitable. But accountability of management to shareholders will increase; restructuring of companies by shareholders' syndicates involving foreign partners with cash and management expertise will occur; and a heavy dose of entrepreneurship is about to enter the system. A stock market is emerging, and we believe prevailing liberalism and low prices will attract investors. You may scoff at some companies on offer, but don't sell the whole system short.

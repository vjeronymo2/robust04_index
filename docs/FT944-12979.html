			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Deutsche Bank puts its money on London Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest commercial bank, yesterday emphasised London's pre-eminence over Frankfurt as an international financial centre by deciding to put all its international investment banking activities in the UK capital. It is combining its activities with those of Morgan Grenfell, the UK merchant bank which it bought in 1989 for Pounds 950m, a few days before Mr Alfred Herrhausen, Deutsche Bank's former chairman, was murdered by terrorists. Mr Hilmar Kopper, who succeeded Mr Herrhausen and worked with him on the Morgan Grenfell acquisition, said the bank would continue to support Frankfurt and expand its activities there. Its Frankfurt investment banking operations, serving German corporate, institutional and other customers, will stay in the German city. The move, marks a change of strategy for Deutsche, which was previously keen to keep Morgan Grenfell as a separate subsidiary. Deutsche said yesterday that the integration of its and Morgan Grenfell's investment banking operations would happen 'over time', and changes to its organisational structure would be 'evolutionary'. It said a new investment banking board would be established under the chairmanship of Mr Ronaldo Schmitz, Deutsche Bank board member, and would also comprise Mr John Craven, Morgan Grenfell's chairman, and Mr Michael Dobson, Morgan chief executive, who will run the combined operation. 'Investment banking is an Anglo-Saxon business,' said Mr Schmitz. 'We want to achieve the global integration of our investment banking business. This cannot be done in Frankfurt. It has got to be in London. New York is outside our time zone. Europe is of overwhelming significance for us.' Mr Kopper said customers expected a range of services from investment bankers. 'A truly European bank must have an integrated pan-European management operating from its largest market - that is London for international products.' Together, the Deutsche Bank and Morgan Grenfell investment banking operations employ more than 6,000 people. Last year, Deutsche earned a pre-tax profit of nearly DM2bn (Dollars 1.34bn) from investment banking with Morgan Grenfell's profits totalling Pounds 236m. Helped by changes in the law and a more relaxed attitude to new financial instruments by Germany's Central Bank, the Bundesbank, Frankfurt has made progress towards becoming a more effective financial centre. But bankers agree its future lies less in competing with London as a global centre and more as an important regional centre. See Lex Convergence of cultures, Page 7</p>

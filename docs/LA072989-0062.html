			<p><P> July 29, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAIDERS CUT TACKLE JACKSON -- NO. 10 DRAFT PICK  </P> <P> The Raiders cut a draft choice, their first of the 1989 training camp,  releasing Charles Jackson, a defensive tackle from Jackson State, Friday. He  was their No. 10 selection.  </P> <P> They also released inside linebacker Eric Snelson, a free agent from Stanford  who was a starter all last exhibition season in the absence of holdout Matt  Millen.  </P> <P> The Raiders have since signed five Plan B free-agent linebackers and seem to be  most impressed by one of the least-recognized -- Joe Costello, formerly of the  Atlanta Falcons. Bigger names Jackie Shipp of Miami and Emmanuel King of  Cincinnati, both former No. 1 picks, are thought to be battling to make the  team.  </P> <P> Former Chicago Bear Otis Wilson, the most famous of the new linebackers, put on  full pads for the first time Friday.  </P> <P> Raider Notes  </P> <P> Another projected starting guard got hurt, but not seriously. Newt Harrell, who  moved up when Dale Hellestrae broke his leg, hyperextended an elbow in  Thursday's practice against the Cowboys and was held out of Friday afternoon's  workout. Coach Mike Shanahan says he hopes Harrell will be able to practice in  pads today. . . . Of the starting secondary, only Stacey Toran worked Friday.  Mike Haynes' lawyer, Howard Slusher, wanted to take a look at his client's new  contract before Haynes signed. Vann McElroy has a sore hip. Terry McDaniel, the  promising cornerback who still must prove he can avoid injuries, has been out  for a week with a groin pull. MARK HEISLER  </P></p>

			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Leading Article: A tilt at windmills IT IS EASY to be scornful of Mrs Margaret Thatcher's diatribe against the European Community. The immoderation of her language has confirmed the wisdom of the Conservative party in retiring her. Equating the 'half-Europe imposed by Soviet tyranny' with the objectives of the EC Commission is a ponderous calumny worthy of those who recently ruled east of the Elbe. The Brussels windmills at which she tilts are grinding British liberties much less fiercely than she imagines. The ex-prime minister does, however, perform a service in exposing contradictions in the Maastricht process. As she predicted in the past, many countries in practice are much less willing to transfer national powers to Community institutions than their Euro-rhetoric suggested. That is why the Germans are jibbing at abandoning the D-Mark. But that is also why Europe is not charging down the road towards a 'super-state' in the manner Mrs Thatcher supposes.</p>

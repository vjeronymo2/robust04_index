			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Analysis): More choice from a point of principle  -Married Couple's Allowances THE MALE Chauvinist Allowance can now go by its proper name as the married couple's allowance. Despite the introduction of independent taxation in 1990, elements of pre-independence paternalism hung on through the allocation to the husband of the married couple's allowance - currently Pounds 1,720. The only exception was in cases where the husband's income was too low for him to make use of it. From April 6 1993, married couples can choose who should receive the allowance or elect to receive half the allowance each. The one case in which a married couple will make a saving is if the wife is a higher rate taxpayer while her husband pays tax at the lower rate. She can now obtain tax relief on Pounds 1,720 at 40 per cent, instead of her husband obtaining it at 25 per cent, saving the couple Pounds 258 a year. However, there will still be a few instances where it will be worthwhile to make a change in allocation on the ground of tax-efficiency. But the government will have scored here on a point of principle at little cost. The chancellor himself said 'this measure will have only a small effect on revenue'. Instead, many working wives will be happy that they are now entitled to claim half the married couple's allowance even when this has no effect on the couple's finances. The new arrangement comes into force from April 6 1993.</p>

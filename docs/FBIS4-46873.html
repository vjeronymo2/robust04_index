This decree had the stamp  "not subject to publication," and, although the news agencies  rather quickly informed the public concerning the creation of  this commission, all its subsequent activities have been veiled  by secrecy and truly nothing "has been subject" to publication.    Certainly, no one today doubts the necessity of overcoming  hyperinflation in Ukraine. From this standpoint the creation of  a commission to develop a plan for financial preparations  appears to be completely normal. As much as the appearance of  this commission, structured as it is, is logical, there is a  more complex question (members of the commission are the  presidential adviser Valentyn Symonenko-the head of the  commission, Mykola Syvulskyy deputy head of the agency for  international cooperation and investment, Israeli ex-finance  minister Itzak Moday, two entrepreneurs - Boris Hubskyy, the  head of the center SLAVUTYCH and Viktor Medvedchuk, the  president of the association of lawyers in Ukraine.) In the view  of some professionals, what seems strange is that the commission  contains no representatives of the Ministry of Finance or any  professionals from the National Bank. But according to others  this is precisely what the makeup of the commission should be -  a minimum number of people (for productivity), a maximum of  expertise and an almost obligatory presence in the commission of  representatives of the executive departments. The last is not  without sense: many economic reforms were prepared by one or  more people, were enacted by a command, headed by a totally  different person (according to some sources, the legendary  Ludwig Erhard worked to the recommendations of two American  economists).    There is a different problem, that of personalities. The  riddle remains, for example, as to why Valentyn Symonenko was  appointed head of the commission, a man who was not known for  any prominent achievements as an expert on financial questions  (obviously, in this case the President relied on his adviser as  a person in whose bureaucratic talents he had full confidence).  One member of the commission who is truly an authority on  finances on the Ukrainian side is Mykola Syvulskyy. The  appearance on the commission of Boris Hubskyy, Hryhoriy Surkis  and Viktor Medvedchuk seems strange, in as much as, certainly  not one of them until now has been known as a prominent  financial expert. According to the words of one Ukrainian  official, who considers himself as well informed, these people  were included on the commission as practical men, who well  understand the "loopholes" in the law, and how to circumvent  them, and therefore can protect the program for financial  stabilization against the appearance within the plan of such  "loopholes." This argument is original, but it is necessary to  admit the following: to compete with the above mentioned trio as  with "practical men" is really quite complicated: how valuable  is just the battle for the Kiev "Dynamo", won by Hryhoriy Surkis  but not without the help of Viktor Medvedchuk, Borys Hubskyy and  other business partners (after Viktor Bezverkhyy, president of  the football club "Dynamo," emerged untouched from the scandal  "on the level of Interpol," associated with the sale of Protasov  and Lytovchenko, it seemed that no force could be found which  would defeat him - but one was found, and it turned out to be  Surkis and his partners). Besides that, one can speculate that  this selection was not accidental, yet for another reason:  Viktor Medvedchuk heads the Ukrainian-American-Israeli  attorney's office of BIM; the makeup of the committee includes  the ex-finance minister for Israel - therefore, evidently, this  could also be a question of definite Israeli capital interests  in Ukraine.    But, absolutely, the most interesting figure on the  commission is the former Israeli finance minister Itzhak Moday.  A man who has three advanced degrees (in engineering,  jurisprudence, and economics), a highly qualified financier,  Itzhak Moday acquired in Israel a reputation as a brilliant  organizer. Becoming minister of finance in 1984, when inflation  was coming close to 500 percent per year, he left the post in  1986, when inflation was at 19 percent. During his second tenure  in this position during 1990-1992, inflation was reduced from 18  percent to just under 10 percent. As was recently reported by  one of the influential Israeli newspapers "Maariv," in January  of last year, on Itzhak Moday's 67th birthday, his former  secretaries arranged a "surprise" party: on a huge cake was  written "9.4 percent inflation - thank you. We have not  forgotten." The fact that many other people in Israel "did not  forget" the achievements of the minister is certified by the  number of legends which are associated with his name. Ukrainian  financiers have also been able to convince themselves of the  exceptionally high professional level of the Israeli  ex-minister. According to Viktor Yushchenko, head of the  directorate of NBU [National Bank of Ukraine], only a few among  those with whom he has had dealings have such a keen sense of  financial problems, and can so brilliantly generate ideas in  this area.    Thus, having united into one commission according to the  directive of the President, these people were to develop, in a  month and a half, a plan for the financial stabilization of  Ukraine and give it to the President back in February. According  to Mykola Syvulskyy, the members of the commission came together  on the position that today's inflation in Ukraine cannot be  subdued purely through monetary methods, that is, only through a  severe restriction on the supply of money; a real effect must be  induced by the policy of a steady reduction of inflation from  month to month, at 5-10 percent, depending on the status that  prevails in the production sector. The money supply is also to  increase, confirms Mykola Syvulskyy, corresponding to the supply  of goods in the market, but at the same time, not in proportion  to the rise in prices (if you are to have, for example, a  guideline of a monthly reduction in inflation by 40 percent,  then the aim is to increase credit deposits by 30-35 percent).  What the other steps are that have been included in the program,  we were unable to determine either from Mykola Syvulskyy or from  Itzhak Moday, nor from the other members of the commission, in  that all of them believe that publication of the details of the  program at least until the beginning of its implementation is  premature.    How will the Israeli experience of overcoming inflation be  adopted and what will be the role of Itzhak Moday in case the  program is approved? It is not simple to give an answer to the  first question in that the tactics announced by Mykola Syvulskyy  do not totally match with the stabilization which took place in  Israel during the years 1985-86. (As is known, the program of  stabilization which entered history as the "plan of professor  Bruno," first of all provided for a strict financial policy, a  sharp reduction of the budget deficit, subsidies and privileges,  and an increase in taxes against a background of a decrease in  the real income of the populace. At the beginning of the reform,  three way deals were made between the government, employers, and  the trade unions according to which the trade unions temporarily  halted strikes and were actually agreeing to the freezing of  wages, the entrepreneurs were agreeing to the actual freezing of  prices, the government took upon itself to control 90 percent of  prices and to maintain the frozen exchange rate of the shekel at  the same level (although it is true, not without the help of the  USA in the form of 1.5 billion US dollars for the stabilization  fund). Specifically due to such dynamics and strict methods, the  country was able to knock down inflation to less than 20 percent  per year and to reduce the price of credit on the world market  from 880 percent to 53-55 percent.) Considering this, the role  of the minister of the country that emerged from a crisis via  such "silken" methods appears to be rather unique in the  realization of a plan for a progressive surmounting of inflation  in a different country. Considering the high professional level  of the ex-minister of finance for Israel, one can suppose that  he sees in our realities a basis for this. One thing which at  the moment Ithzak Moday is emphasizing is the essential need for  him to be personally present in Ukraine if the program is going  to be carried out: "Economics - this is a living entity which  reacts very sensitively to all changes. This is why the creator  of the program needs to oversee his creation, in order to have  the ability to make essential corrections and modifications to  its behavior."    And the last question - what fate awaits the program? The  answer will depend on how developments in parliament will  unfold, who will join the government and who will head it. (It  is interesting that three members of the commission - Mykola  Syvulskyy, Viktor Medvedchuk, and Valentyn Symonenko - ran for  the new parliament, but only Valentyn Symonenko succeeded). Thus  the plan can be buried as easily as it was created, once again  testifying to the simple truth that in Ukraine you can create as  many programs as you wish, but this does not mean that they will  mean anything in this country.</p>

			<p>920116 FT  16 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: First Leisure If Brent Walker has any fans left, they might profit by studying the steady rise of First Leisure. Since its flotation in 1984 it has outperformed the market by more than 200 per cent, while its market capitalisation has risen tenfold to Pounds 460m. Granted, yesterday's earnings were only marginally up on the year before, and that only because of a lower tax charge. But the performance was still remarkable when set against the leisure sector's decline. The trick has been simple enough. From the start, First Leisure avoided high gearing in favour of cautious expansion and tight cost controls. It refined its markets - unglamorous niches like ten-pin bowling and discotheques - and offered customers an attractive combination of comfort and value for money. When consumers start spending again, it should justify its historic rating of 19 times earnings. Until then, it can quietly chip away at competitors' market share.</p>

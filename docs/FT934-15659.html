			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Sky 'left itself open to pirates' SKY Television exposed itself to having its decoding cards pirated when it closed its security department earlier this year, a specialist suggested yesterday. Mr John McCormac, a specialist who monitors the activities of pirates in a newsletter called Hack Watch News, said: 'This department had provided intelligence on the piracy industry and prevented a number of hacks. Had this department been in existence this hack may not have had the impact that it has had.' According to Mr McCormac, who has been monitoring the efforts of unauthorised card operators, pirated Sky cards have been available throughout Europe since late April. When the official cards were upgraded to take account of the new Sky Multi-Channel package, the pirates responded within a week. Had Sky stuck to its original suggestion of changing its cards every three months, said Mr McCormac, it would have been uneconomic to try to produce the unauthorised cards which are illegal to manufacture, sell or use in the UK and illegal to import to the UK mainland. Mr McCormac, who estimates that the number of illicit pirate Sky cards and chips could run into six figures across Europe, said yesterday: 'Sky will have to come up with a major upgrade in the next one or two months or change all their cards.' Such a change would involve a multi-million pound exercise. Satellite Decoding Systems, an Irish pirate-card distributor with a branch in Warrington, says it is committed to exporting its pirate cards to the UK. Mr David Lyons, who runs the company, said: 'Sky is running out of things to do. We know all the information in their chip and if they call their card in we already have the information they will be using on their next card.' Responsiveness to change is its main marketing tool. Although the cards initially cost Pounds 220, the company says that users will be able to use them indefinitely for a further Pounds 30 a year. Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a stake in British Sky Broadcasting, operators of Sky Television.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] Discussing the atmosphere surrounding U.S. Secretary  of State Warren Christopher's tour of the region, due to begin  next week, the newspaper AL-BA'TH says: This tour comes after a  lengthy halt in the Washington peace talks and in the wake of a  premeditated attempt by Israel to conceal the peace process  behind a thick wall of blood and fire. Meanwhile, the Israeli  rulers stabbed the peace process in the back, undermined it, and  derailed it from the bases set for it. This has created a  gloomy and disappointing atmosphere, making it hard to be  optimistic over the possibility of extricating the peace process  from the difficult situation created by the Tel Aviv rulers.    Discussing the U.S. role in the region, the paper says: The  full partner role, which the United States chose for itself, has  not changed the situation. This is because the United States is  evading the requirements of partnership, represented by a call  for adopting the bases set for the peace process and respecting  international legitimacy and its resolutions, in addition to  holding discussions with the parties concerned to achieve and  confirm this respect, and using all means available to convince  the parties that reject international legitimacy and its  resolutions and try to impose their will on others.    AL-BA'TH asserts that a stand in favor of international  legitimacy and its resolutions as well as standing alongside  justice and peace are not a departure from the full partner role  or from the role of an honest and effective mediator.    Concluding its editorial, AL-BA'TH stresses that Syria  cooperated with the United States in order to establish a just  and comprehensive peace that would be honorable and not  humiliating--a peace that would secure the rights of all and  respect international legitimacy without breaching it. The  paper emphasizes that Syria will continue to support a just and  comprehensive peace, international legitimacy, and anyone who  champions these values, principles, and approaches. Syria,  however, will never be alongside injustice, nor will it accept a  false peace that would bring humiliation to future generations  and consecrate the encroachments on our territories and rights.    Also discussing U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's  tour, the newspaper AL-THAWRAH says: The Arab parties welcome  any effective and active U.S. efforts that would contribute to  removing the numerous obstacles which are still impeding the  peace process. They even used to call for upgrading the U.S.  role to a level befitting the full, fair, and honest partner, so  this partner will have a clear and frank say in determining the  course of the peace process and preserving the bases and  principles according to which the disputing parties attended the  Madrid conference, particularly concerning a comprehensive  solution and the land-for-peace principle.    Discussing the intransigent Israeli positions, AL-THAWRAH  says: If, during his visit, Christopher plans to provide an  appropriate atmosphere to unleash the peace process anew, he  will first face the intransigent Israeli position which is still  creating obstacles, setting conditions and uttering no's, which  make it impossible to achieve any real balance in the peace  process. This is because the Rabin government persistently  calls for relinquishing the Madrid formula and publicly rejects  full withdrawal. Moreover, it does not accept any discussion on  Jerusalem and the settlements, and always seeks to single out  the Arab parties and peddle partial solutions that would  squander the peace opportunity, territory, and rights.    The paper adds: As part of a disinformation and deception  campaign, the Rabin government is now calling on Syria to hold  secret negotiations and conclude a separate solution away from  other Arab tracks.    Concluding, AL-THAWRAH says: Everyone knows that Syria wants  peace and does its utmost to achieve it. Syria and the entire  world, however, believe that if peace is not just and  comprehensive and if it does not regain the entire occupied Arab  territories, it will not be real and firm, and will not last; it  will simply be a temporary truce that can end at any moment.  The United States should take this into account and begin  devoting its efforts to promoting the negotiations toward  achieving peace. Such peace will end aggression and occupation  and will achieve justice and security for all.</p>

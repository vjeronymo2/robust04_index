			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Colombia tries to filter out excess coffee production THE SIZE of Colombia's coffee harvest - estimated at about 17m bags this year - has become both a financial burden and a political embarrassment. So much so that the government and Federacafe, the coffee growers' federation, are trying to devise ways of reducing production by 1m to 1.5m bags (60 kg each) and hope to have a scheme outlined before next week's International Coffee Organisation meetings in London. The whole idea of pulling up coffee trees is a role-reversal for Federacafe's local committees, which were created to provide incentives for growers and to improve the quality and quantity of coffee produced. Their success, based on technical assistance, effective action against rust and other coffee tree diseases, cheap fertiliser and constant renovation, is reflected in today's output figures. Committees that increase coffee production have normally been rewarded with bigger budgets. Since the collapse of the International Coffee Agreement in July 1989 Colombia's share of the world market has grown to nearly 18 per cent, with annual exports of some 13m bags. Local consumption absorbs another 1.5m bags and stocks have built up to more than 9m bags. For the National Coffee Fund, which finances the purchase of the crop at a loss, the situation is clearly unsustainable. And for a country advocating better management to achieve higher prices, it is uncomfortable. Although the domestic price paid to coffee growers has dropped, it is still high in comparison with international prices. Coffee is one of the most profitable legal crops in Colombia with an assured market. A further reduction in the support price would probably make little difference to the area planted with coffee - mainly because alternative crops do not bring a secure income. At the top policy-making level, the government and the coffee authorities, as well as the private exporters, are all in agreement with the plan to take between 100,000 and 150,000 hectares (250,000-370,000 acres) out of production. But so far neither small nor large growers have shown any inclination to uproot their trees - in spite of the Dollars 1,500 to Dollars 1,800 per ha that has been mentioned as a possible incentive. The cost to the coffee fund would be close to the cost of buying the extra harvest over one year. Colombia has about 1m ha of coffee distributed over several regions. The eradication plan will probably affect all the main production areas and is likely to target medium and large, rather than small, growers. Those who accept the plan may have to sign an undertaking not to plant coffee within a certain period. The main problem is to find alternatives for coffee farmers  -among the possibilities are flowers, fruit, livestock and vegetables but none have such dependable earnings. Exporters believe there is a good chance of establishing a new agreement. 'We're seeing a new, active Brazil, this is a big change,' said Mr Diego Pizano of Federacafe. 'The Europeans are also supporting a new pact with quotas. There are difficulties of course but the basis could be agreed at the London meeting.' Colombia is arguing for a quota distribution reflecting performance during the free market period. Depending on the global quota, this would give Colombina exporters 11m to 12m bags - 1m less than current export volumes. Hence the need to adopt the domestically unpopular eradication plan.</p>

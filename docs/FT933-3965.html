			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / International Company News: Asian deal for Canada mine groups CAMECO and Uranerz, Canada's biggest uranium producers, have signed a joint 10-year marketing and technical development agreement with Katep, the uranium producer controlled by the Republic of Kazakhstan. As a first step, the Canadian companies will invest USDollars 3m in Katep's uranium facilities to improve efficiency, safety and environmental performance. Acting as agents, they will help Katep sell its uranium concentrates on long-term contract to world customers. Katep has considerable uranium ore and also extensive in situ leachable resources. Cameco produced 5,200 tonnes of uranium oxide last year, and German-owned Uranerz 2,600 tonnes. Their mines are in northern Saskatchewan. Their capacity, plus Katep's, represent 30 per cent of world produc-tion. Cameco, now 51.5 per cent-held by the public, is carrying out a feasibility study of the Kumtor gold deposit in Kyrgyzstan, another former Asian republic of the old Soviet Union. Cominco reached agreement with 2,000 members of the United Steelworkers at its lead-zinc operations in Trail, British Columbia. It covers job flexibility and security, contracting out and job cuts through attrition.</p>

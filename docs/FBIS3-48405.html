			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Jan. 22 (YONHAP) -- The Seoul District Public  Prosecutors' Office Saturday questioned Pak Kun-po, president of  the Pusan Chemical Co., and three other people about a complaint  filed by Pusan charging Yi Chol-hui and Chang Yong-cha with  fraud.    Prosecutors asked them the details of how Pusan made a  contract with Kim Chu-sung, son-in-law of Yi and Chang.    Yi and Chang will be summoned early next week, a prosecution  spokesman said.    Pusan, a footwear maker, Thursday accused the couple and Kim  of fraud over a deal to sell 6,976 square meters of land in  Pusan to Pusan that fell through because Chohung Bank had a lien  on the land.    Kim, who had received 2.3 billion won from Pusan as contract  deposit, gave Pusan a promissory note for 4.25 billion won (5.25  million U.S. dollars) as breach-of-contract damages. The note,  issued by Kim and endorsed by Yi and Chang, was later dishonored.</p>

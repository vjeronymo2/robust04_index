			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Gaza Provincial Governor Eugenio Numaio has  described as unfounded the accusations made by Jose de Castro,  Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] Foreign Affairs  Department chief, that Renamo authorities are experiencing many  difficulties because of the obstacles raised by provincial  authorities.    On 14 January Jose de Castro granted an interview to Radio  Mozambique in Xai-Xai during which he accused the Gaza  Provincial Government in general, and Governor Eugenio Numaio in  particular, of not even wanting to hear of Renamo in the  province. He also said that the provincial government has not  shown any interest in granting premises for the Renamo  provincial branch to operate and to accommodate Renamo's three  provincial advisers.    Gaza Provincial Governor Numaio noted that such accusations  are typical of people who only know how to make demands and know  little about the difficulties faced by those wanting to satisfy  those needs.</p>

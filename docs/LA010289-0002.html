			<p><P> January 2, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CARING FOR THE EARTH  </P> <P> Events converged during 1988 to make the state of the Earth a matter of keen  public concern. Now comes the difficult part. In 1989 the involved officials  must move forcefully to translate that concern into serious public policy so  that this new awareness does not become just another passing trend or lost  opportunity.  </P> <P> The issues will not go away. There is a danger, however, that the enormousness  of the collective problem will overwhelm a public desire to do something. After  all, what can one person do about the atmosphere or the ocean? The United  States has become a result-oriented nation that likes to see some bang for its  buck, and soon. A dollar invested today to avert a global-warming crisis may  have no visible payoff for decades.  </P> <P> But perception is critically important. What made 1988 the year of the Earth  may have been a coincidence of unrelated and largely irrelevant circumstances.  The appearance of medical waste on Atlantic beaches or the Yellowstone Park  fires had nothing to do with the ozone hole. The 1988 drought may have had  nothing to do with global warming. The growing trash crisis certainly did not.  But all these events impinged on the public consciousness until they set off an  alarm bell: Something is very wrong.  </P> <P> The importance of this public attention cannot be underrated. But little  happened in 1988 that was new or surprising to most environmental scientists.  And Earthlings possess most or all of the technical equipment needed to slow or  halt just about all the bad things that are assaulting the planet. What has  been lacking is the public demand, the political will and an institutional  structure for facing the challenge.  </P> <P> The new year provides the opportunity for setting this process in motion. The  obvious source of leadership is the presidency. President-elect George Bush  already has been inundated with stacks of studies for combatting environmental  problems on a national and global scale. One of the best was compiled by a  50-member bipartisan task force under the chairmanship of Sens. Timothy E.  Wirth (D-Colo.) and John Heinz III (R-Pa.). In addition to the more traditional  regulatory controls, the plan emphasizes the search for common ground and the  development of market incentives for pollution control.  </P> <P> The Wirth-Heinz outline also makes the critical point that the public must be  informed of the full social costs of environmental action or inaction, not just  the direct outlays. Because so many environmental issues are interrelated, some  policies will attack several problems at once and provide multiple benefits.  The energy-efficiency program advocated by the Wirth-Heinz study would help  fight global warming, acid rain and local air pollution while also improving  U.S. energy security and productivity. Short-term investments can yield  long-range national economic benefits. Existing fragmented federal policies  often work at cross-purposes or lack the public attention and support that they  deserve.  </P> <P> Bush will have to decide what he thinks are the most effective means of  advancing the environmental agenda. An address to Congress is an obvious  possibility. Or he could revive the dormant President's Council on  Environmental Quality, which is supposed to serve as a clearing house and as a  coordinator of programs. Better yet would be the creation of a Cabinet  Department of the Environment that would consolidate the Environmental  Protection Agency with related agencies from within the Interior and  Agriculture departments. Most other industrialized nations created  cabinet-level environmental agencies years ago.  </P> <P> Since so many of these issues observe no boundaries, the United States must  pursue international agreements to control pollutants and preserve critical  rain forests. The environment is an appropriate topic for the next superpower  summit and the annual meeting of the Western industrial nations, leading  perhaps to a global environmental conference.  </P> <P> Environmental problems, from protection of U.S. wild lands to the global  atmosphere, seem immense. Still, every citizen can have an effect. It begins  with caring.  </P></p>

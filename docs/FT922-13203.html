			<p>920413 FT  13 APR 92 / The Lex Column: France Confirmation in Paris last week that the French finance ministry is preparing legislation to outlaw partial takeovers is a welcome development. The practice of making bids for only two-thirds of a company's equity has long antagonised the institutions, besides reinforcing outside suspicions that the Paris market is tilted against minority shareholders. An important turning point was this year's partial offer by Pinault for the Parisian stores group Au Printemps, which infuriated a wide range of market opinion. Significantly, the Agnellis were quick on a later occasion to convert their initial two-thirds bid for Exor into a full takeover bid when mutterings of disapproval turned into a crescendo of discontent. While bourse reform in the last decade has improved France's international standing, it would be wrong to think that the country is about to become a paradise for the likes of Lord Hanson. The concept of concert parties remains ill-defined and, though the spirit of the new law will be against them, one wonders just where the line will be drawn. The government will be reluctant to surrender its power to intervene where defence, banking and other strategic interests are at stake. A key challenge, though, is to find a way of conducting takeovers which does not involve excessive use of the courts. The disagreement between the COB and the CBV - the two Stock Exchange authorities - is part of the problem. Much as it may stick in local throats, some body based on the UK's Takeover Panel may ultimately be required.</p>

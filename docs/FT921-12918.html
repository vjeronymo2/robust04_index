			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / PowerGen to build coal import facility POWERGEN, the electricity generator, yesterday proved it was serious about replacing the coal it buys from British Coal with cheaper imports by announcing an outlay of Pounds 40m on a new 5m-tonne coal terminal in Liverpool. The announcement will add to the uncertainty over the future size of British Coal now the electricity industry is privatised. British Coal supplies PowerGen with 26.4m tonnes, falling to 24.6m tonnes in the year to March 1993, and National Power with 44m tonnes, falling to 40m tonnes. The terminal, which will be designed and built by NEI Clarke Chapman on the Gladstone Dock, leased by the Mersey Dock and Harbour Company to PowerGen, is expected to be operating by late next year. 'This will allow PowerGen to withdraw their Fiddlers' Ferry power station (in Warrington, Cheshire) completely from the UK market,' said Mr Gerard McCloskey, of the newsletter International Coal Report. He said that PowerGen was also beginning to squeeze British Coal further by selling imported coal to industrial customers in competition with British Coal. National Power, the other large generator, was doing likewise. British Coal has argued in the past that the two generators were bluffing about their ability to import coal without pushing the price up - but in Commons Energy Committee meetings earlier this week National Power reaffirmed that it planned to be in a position to import half its coal by the mid 90s. PowerGen said it did not believe that would push prices up, as there was plenty of spare coal produced worldwide. PowerGen can already import 5m tonnes to its Kingsnorth power station on the Thames, and has a joint venture with National Power and Associated British Ports to build a 10m-tonne terminal at Immingham on the Humber. National Power is developing two 3m-tonne terminals at Hull and on the Tees, and a 5m-tonne terminal at Bristol. The two generators' plans to replace British coal with orimulsion, a bitumen-based fuel, still face strong environmental opposition.</p>

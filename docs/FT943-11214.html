			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Rethink on London's healthcare urged by policy centre The government is today urged to respond to mounting concern over its plans to reshape healthcare in London. In an intervention that will be highly embarrassing for ministers, Mr Robert J Maxwell, chief executive of the King's Fund health policy centre, says in a pamphlet that there is 'widespread concern' that the changes are putting patients at risk. He says: 'At a minimum there is a need to re-establish confidence, revive timescales and review the management of the transition.' Mr Maxwell's comments will prove particularly difficult for the government because it was a King's Fund report two years ago that first recommended what has become the government's policy of reducing hospital beds in London and diverting resources to family doctor and community services. Some hospitals, including St Bartholomew's in the City, are scheduled to close, while others, among them Guy's and St Thomas', are due to merge. Mr Maxwell argues that the case for tilting London's healthcare towards primary services, with specialist hospital activities organised around fewer centres, remains overwhelming. However, he says, while there have been gains over the past 18 months, including improvements in primary services, there have also been weaknesses with 'a deterioration in many London hospitals, a decline in public confidence and a lack of communication of what is actually happening'. The government, he says, should not back away from change because it is difficult or unpopular but neither should it continue with present policies regardless of opposition and criticism. He proposes a number of changes in the handling of the transition. He also calls on the government to agree that there should be no further reduction in hospital beds while the pressure on beds and accident and emergency departments 'both remain as intense as they do now'. The government faces dilemmas of timing. Hospital closures are unpopular with the public and the timetable for achieving them is so long that the future of London's healthcare is certain to be an issue at the next general election. Immediate problems are exacerbated by the fact that inner-London hospitals are losing patients under the National Health Service's new contract funding arrangements and rely on subsidies to keep going. Mr Maxwell warns that in several areas of London 'the financial situation is one that continually threatens to go out of control and to drive damaging cutbacks in service'.</p>

			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hesitant Tokyo mildly easier as Hong Kong falls 2.3% Investors remained inactive ahead of the US Federal Reserve Board's Open Market Committee meeting, and the Nikkei 225 average declined on index linked selling by arbitrageurs, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index was finally 54.91 easier at 20,133.53 after a day's low of 20,067.41 and high of 20,174.93. A fall in futures prices on the overnight Chicago market prompted a bout of arbitrage selling earlier in the session. Small-lot buying by overseas investors later eroded some of the losses. Volume remained low, totalling 251m shares against 285m. The Topix index of all first section stocks dipped 2.58 to 1,636.43 and the Nikkei 300 lost 0.54 at 299.13. Declines led rises by 614 to 369, with 188 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 1.19 firmer at 1,335.88. Market participants said many investors were still wary of any surprises from the spate of company earnings announcements and were reluctant to commit funds in spite of the yen's easing against the dollar. Meanwhile, technical indicators were also worrying some dealers. 'The three short term moving averages nearly converging, the lack of volatility and the very low volumes seem to be precursors of a sharp move up or down,' said Mr Yutaka Nakai, analyst at Daiwa Securities. High-technology stocks were higher on buying by foreign investors. Hitachi, the day's most active issue, rose Y5 to Y1,000 and Toshiba put on Y3 at Y798. Large-capital steels were also firmer, with Kawasaki Steel up Y2 to Y385. Some banks were lower on arbitrage selling. Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank slipped Y10 to Y1,950. Profit-taking depressed real estate and pharmaceuticals shares, previously bought as laggards. Mitsubishi Estate receded Y20 to Y1,220 and Takeda Chemical Y30 to Y1,230. The rise in gold and copper prices buoyed mining shares. Dowa Mining advanced Y12 to Y585 and Sumitomo Metal Mining added Y13 at Y925. The low volume encouraged individual investors' trading in speculative stocks. Ga-jo-en Kanko forged ahead Y27 to Y184 and Wakachiku Construction gained Y9 at Y669. Brother Industries, however, relinquished Y13 to Y706 on profit-taking. In Osaka, the OSE average shed 57.55 to 22,366.93 in volume of 20.4m shares. Aoyama Trading, the men's suits retailer, fell Y120 to Y4,180. Roundup Regional markets continued mixed, awaiting the outcome of yesterday's FOMC meeting. HONG KONG closed sharply lower as the brief detention of a prominent Beijing dissident raised worries about the renewal of China's Most Favoured Nation trade status with the US in a market already cautious about US interest rates. The Hang Seng index dropped 208.71, or 2.3 per cent, to 9,044.70. Turnover came to HKDollars 4.88bn, against a revised HKDollars 4.10bn on Monday. The market was also speculating about a possible early agreement with China on financing Hong Kong's new airport, but news that the Sino-British Airport Committee will meet on Friday to discuss the issue emerged after the market close. Among blue chips, HSBC slid HKDollars 2.50 to HKDollars 83.50, China Light HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 40.75, Swire Pacific 'A' HKDollars 2 to HKDollars 55.50 and Hutchison HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 30. TAIPEI retreated 1.6 per cent as profits were taken following the market's recent rally. The weighted index fell 98.95 to 6,015.83 in TDollars 67.3bn turnover. Financials led the falls, with China Development down TDollars 3.5 to TDollars 129.5 and Cathay Life losing TDollars 6 to TDollars 257. SINGAPORE was steady with selective buying seen among blue chips. The Straits Times Industrial index finished 14.08 higher at 2,304.49. Shipyard stocks were firmer amid talk that a foreign brokerage was issuing covered warrants on a basket of shipyard companies. KUALA LUMPUR was easier after a moderate session, a spate of selling near the close having pushed the index down from an early high. The composite index settled 5.88 off at 991.96 in volume of 76.4m shares. Telekoms, facing a competitive telephone system, weakened 90 cents to MDollars 18.70. SYDNEY retreated after Monday's sharp gain. The All Ordinaries index finished 14.9 down at 2,096.0 after touching 2,094.8. Turnover was ADollars 548m. BHP slipped 30 cents to ADollars 17.94, Western Mining dropped 23 cents to ADollars 7.85 and Pasminco shed 15 cents to ADollars 1.80. CRA contrasted with a rise of 8 cents to ADollars 18.46. Turnover amounted to ADollars 560m. In the banking sector, ANZ slipped 7 cents to ADollars 4.75, Westpac dipped 4 cents to ADollars 4.98 and National Australia eased 2 cents to ADollars 12.04. WELLINGTON eased, with most of the day's activity taking place in Fletcher Challenge. FCL closed 1 cent up at NZDollars 3.90 as the NZSE-40 Capital index shed 8.21 to 2,118.04 in turnover of NZDollars 51m. SEOUL turned higher in a technical rebound after its three-day consolidation, and the composite index improved 5.21 to 946.87 ahead of today's market holiday. MANILA rose strongly, helped by an overnight gain on Wall Street for PLDT, together with buying of San Miguel and Manila Electric. The composite index moved forward 34.20 to 2,936.43. Turnover was 950.4m pesos. PLDT put on 50 pesos at 1,955 pesos, San Miguel 'B' increased 5 pesos to 235 and Manila Electric added 5 pesos at 330. BOMBAY's 30-share index registered a 41.59 decline at 3,802.50 after index-weighted shares fell, but the broader market was steady after a dull session. Hopes remained high, however, that forward trading will be allowed to resume after a meeting of the Securities and Exchange Board of India on Friday. The old badla, or carry forward system, was banned in mid-March on the grounds that it led to excessive speculation. KARACHI ended firmer on heavy buying of polyester stocks, reflecting expectations of higher profits because of a cotton shortage. The KSE 100-share index rose 4.43 to 2,189.44.</p>

			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Money Markets: Overnight rates soar CONFUSION AND turmoil hit the UK money markets after the Bank of England announced it was raising its minimum lending rate to 15 per cent in an attempt to stop the pound falling through its floor in the European exchange rate mechanism, Emma Tucker writes. Overnight rates soared to 100 per cent as liquidity was squeezed and the government did everything it could to avoid a devaluation of sterling. 'The authorities have been pulling out all the stops to show that they are not going to devalue,' said one analyst. Speculation of a rise in base rates was already rippling through the market early yesterday morning after intervention by European central banks on Tuesday had failed to lift sterling off its DM2.7780 floor. In the early round the Bank of England announced a forecast liquidity shortage of Pounds 650m. This was followed at 11am by the news that it was reintroducing a minimum lending rate of 12 per cent, which triggered a two-point rise in base lending rates to 12 per cent from 10 per cent. But on the foreign exchanges it soon became apparent that the authorities' action had little effect on sterling. Later in the morning the Bank announced that any discount houses wanting to borrow from the Bank were invited to do so at 2.30pm, but diverged from normal practice by not stating the rate. This suggested another rate rise in the afternoon. At 2.30pm the Bank announced a three-point rise in the minimum lending rate to 15 per cent. This time, however, the clearing banks said they would wait until today to announce their intentions. By the end of the day the Bank said it had lent Pounds 920m to the market at 12 per cent. Interbank rates eased in later trading as the market started to come to the conclusion that sterling would be devalued. The key three-month interbank rate stabilised at around 16 per cent. One-week money came down to around 25 per cent, while further out, one-year money closed at around 12.5 per cent. Sterling futures also rallied in the middle of the afternoon on the back of speculation that the pound would be devalued. The December short sterling traded in a 155-point range in heavy trading.</p>

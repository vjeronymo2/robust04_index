			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Thais lower growth expectations THE FALLOUT from the bloodshed in Thailand last month could slow the country's growth rate for the year to between 6.5 and 7.4 per cent, according to estimates released yesterday by two forecasting agencies. The figures are the first systematic attempts to measure the impact of the troubles on one of the world's fastest growing economies. The more optimistic figure of 7.4 per cent came from the National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB), the government's planning agency. The independent Thailand Development Research Institute (TDRI) predicted growth would slow to 6.5 per cent. Both had earlier predicted growth at close to 8 per cent for this year. Their figures would have been worse if the discord between the military and the parties that supported it on the one hand, and the civilian opposition on the other, had not been eased by the appointment of Mr Anand Panyarachun as a neutral prime minister last week. The main difference between the two institutes is the assessment of the decline of tourism, a principal foreign exchange earner. TDRI believes Thailand could lose almost 29bn baht (Pounds 616bn), or half a percentage point of gross domestic product this year, although a recovery is predicted for 1993. The planning agency's estimate is for a loss of between 10bn to 20bn baht.</p>

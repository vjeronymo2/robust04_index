			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Doubt over council's schools plan A WIDELY publicised move by Wandsworth council, the Conservatives' flagship borough in south London, to introduce selective primary schools with government funding may breach the rules of the City Challenge scheme under which funding is being sought. City Challenge is an inner-city regeneration scheme that takes Pounds 750m from existing urban programmes to concentrate it on 20 authorities over five years. It is intended to promote partnership between public, private and voluntary sectors. Wandsworth's bid - one of more than 60 submitted to the Department of the Environment - includes Pounds 3m to improve pre-school education, upgrade three primary schools in Battersea as selective 'junior technology colleges', and establish a state 'prep' school on the site of Battersea Technology College. The college, due to open in September, is part of the government's controversial city technology college scheme. The original plan was to spawn elite schools funded largely by the private sector - but in practice the colleges are reliant on the state for about 80 per cent of funding because of a shortage of business sponsors. The environment department said yesterday: 'We would not pay (through City Challenge) for things ordinarily part of a local education authority's function. City technology colleges are not within the City Challenge remit.' There is also doubt about Wandsworth's ability to attract 'partnership' funding. Mr Edward Lister, the borough's education chairman, has said the plan will be open to outside funding - but the scheme has failed to attract any private money, nor is any in prospect. Mr Lister defended the introduction of selection at primary level as 'a welcome addition to parental choice in a deprived area'. Under Wandsworth's plan, applicants for the prep school would be selected by interview. The results of seven-year-old tests might also be taken into account. Entry to Battersea Technology College would be by interview and examination. If successful, the scheme would mark the most significant reverse for comprehensive education for 20 years.</p>

			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Leading Article: Herculean task for Italy ITALIANS HAVE voted by a larger-than-expected margin to reshape the political system under which their country has been run since the second world war. The referendums on Sunday and Monday confirmed the momentum behind reform, above all the drive to redraw the electoral laws that have produced five decades of weak coalitions. The Herculean task is to translate this wish for change into new policies and structures capable of making Italy a better governed country, able to hold its own in the mainstream of Europe The difficulties of the transformation bear some resemblance to those that have confronted countries in eastern and central Europe. The struggle has been made more complex by the challenge of steering Italy through its most severe recession for 20 years, while limiting the country's chronic budget deficit. But after the damage wrought by revelations of corruption and misdoing, the country's political establishment has now no choice but to proceed with renewal with utmost speed. The direction of the desired transition is now evident. The Italian parliament must quickly transcribe the voters' wish for an end - or at least a substantial modification - of proportional representation into legislation ensuring a new basis for elections, perhaps as early as the autumn. Full-scale rewriting of Italy's 1946 constitution is a task which should await the next parliament. But the process of constitutional reform is not merely at the top of the agenda; it is now under way. The nature of the politicians and the parties who will carry out the electorate's mandate for change is far less clear. Mr Giuliano Amato, the current prime minister, could stay on at the helm of a new interim government specifically charged with organising a transition culminating in its own extinction. In view of the urgency of its tasks, not least in the budgetary field, such an interim administration should draw support from as broad a coalition as possible. This could include not only the Radicals, but also the Lombard League, whose rise in northern Italy has dramatically reflected the yearning for a break with the past. Neither Mr Amato nor any other established party figure would seem suitable to guide Italy beyond the next elections. New figures will be needed. For all his success in the referendums, Mr Mario Segni, the former Christian Democrat who headed the reform movement, may not fit the bill. In Italy's shifting political landscape, the referendum results guarantee neither a passport to better political management, nor an automatic demise of the old nomenklatura. It is unlikely, for instance, that scrapping state funding of political parties will, by itself, make them less prey to nefarious influences. Furthermore, a first-past-the-post voting system, which increases the likelihood of large majorities by dominant regional parties, may raise rather than diminish the risk of political fragmentation. The Christian Democrats, previously the main party of government, have been badly hit by allegations that Mr Giulio Andreotti, seven times prime minister, has for years been consorting with the Mafia. But if voters - particularly in the south - start to realise that the ending of the old order brings real sacrifices, the party's fortunes could again start to rise. Italy's natural dynamism needs a political system which will be more open, just and efficient than the one which - precisely because of the possibilities for abuse of power and patronage - has hitherto proved so entrenched. Italy's voters have chosen a high-risk course, but it is the only one available. The transition will bring discomfort. The greater the Italians' recognition that it is worth bearing, the higher will be the chance of success.</p>

			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / International Company News: HKSE censure forces newspaper chief to resign Mr Yu Pun Hoi yesterday resigned as chairman of the Ming Pao newspaper group after the Hong Kong Stock Exchange censured him for failing, on three occasions, to own up to a criminal record. A senior stock exchange official said the exchange took seriously Mr Yu's failure to observe its listing rules requiring directors to disclose past criminal convictions. 'The issue is not what he did 14 years ago,' said Mr Herbert Hui, head of the listing division. 'The issue is that 12 years on, as a director, he negligently signed our listing agreement three times.' The resignation of Mr Yu comes at a time of upset in Hong Kong's media industry. The Oriental Daily group's foray into English-language publishing appears to have foundered. The acrimony surrounding last month's dismissal of the paper's editor continues to sour relations between the publication's largely expatriate staff and Chinese owners. This week, most of the senior staff of the Eastern Express resigned and the continued publication of the paper is in doubt. Meanwhile, there was confusion at Ming Pao last night, and Mr Yu was unable to say who would replace him as chairman. Mr Yu, and interests associated with him, own 60.5 per cent of the company. Since the disclosure last week that he had served a short prison term in 1979 for cheque fraud and possession of a firearm, Mr Yu has come under intense media attention. His private life, about which little is known, has been subjected to scrutiny, much of it barren. On Wednesday, his peers deserted him when he was forced to step down from the chairmanship of the Newspaper Society of Hong Kong, the colony's publishers' association. Significantly, representatives of the colony's two main pro-China newspapers voted for his dismissal. Mr Yu, through his privately-held CIM, is a large investor in media on the mainland and was thought to have powerful friends. Mr Yu has also resigned from the board of South Sea Development, a property development and investment company, in which he has a 36 per cent interest. He stepped down earlier this week from a non-executive directorship at Tristate, a garment manufacturer.</p>

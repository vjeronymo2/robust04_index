Sqn Ldr Prasong said he would meet Mr Qian during the  Chinese  foreign minister's stopover in Bangkok and, if need be use the  opportunity to clarify any problems. [passage omitted] Earlier  in the day, Sqn Ldr Prasong said he had instructed Permanent  Secretary for Foreign Affairs Pracha Khunakasem to clarify the  country's stance with the Chinese embassy, and the Government  itself was ready to confirm the policy. "The visit of Taiwanese  President is like that of the Dalai Lama during which China also  protested to the Thai Government," said Sqn Ldr Prasong.  [passage omitted]    Foreign Minister Prasong reiterated that Thailand's  one-China  policy did not bar Thai people and businesses from making  contact with the Taiwanese regarding commerce and trade affairs  or at a personal level. The minister noted that there was no  official welcoming ceremony for the Taiwanese president when he  arrived in Bangkok on Wednesday. He also said Dr Amnuai did not  receive Mr Li in the capacity of a senior official.    He said people who went to meetings with the Taiwanese  president were not from the Cabinet, which belongs the executive  branch, but from the Parliament which is regarded as the  legislative branch.    Sqn Ldr Prasong said he was happy to clarify the matter with  the House Foreign Affairs Committee at their invitation about  his involvement in the matter if he was available during that  time. If not, he would instruct the permanent secretary to go  instead. [passage omitted]</p>

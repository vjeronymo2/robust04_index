			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Dispatch by reporter Chou Te-hui (0719 1795 1920): "Russia </F> Supplies Beijing With an Arms Sales List"]    [Text] Moscow, 25 Apr (LIEN HO PAO)--According to Russia's  General Staff Headquarters, Russia has recently given mainland  China a list of 44 advanced weapons for the latter's reference  in purchasing weapons. On the list are Sukhoi Su-30K and MiG-31  fighters, air defense missile systems, and so on.    Russia-mainland China military cooperation has attracted  great attention. In the face of great concern, Russia's General  Staff Headquarters, Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations, and  other departments concerned broke the silence by proposing plans  and guidelines for arms sales at a congressional hearing on  China issues.    Antonchev [an dong xue ke fu 1344 2639 7185 0668 1133),  representative from the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations,  said: "According to the latest statistics, Russia owes $1.5  billion to mainland China, of which $1 billion is loans and $500  million results from the change in the form of clearing foreign  exchange. The Russian Government offered to 'pay off the debts  with weapons.' Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin will  discuss the matter with the mainland hierarchy during his visit  to Beijing in late May."    As disclosed by the Russian General Staff Headquarters,  following Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev's visit to the  mainland in October last year, the two countries signed an  agreement on long- term military cooperation. It is certain  that over the next two years, the two countries will have  frequent exchange visits by military delegations and intensify  their cooperation in military and high-tech fields.    The Russian General Staff Headquarters also said that after  selling 26 Sukhoi Su-27 fighters to mainland China last year,  the Russian military has recently sent a list of 44 advanced  weapons to mainland China for its reference in purchasing  weapons, adding that among the main items on the list are five  kinds of new fighters: The Sukhoi Su-27 and Su-30K, the MiG-29  and MiG-31, and the TY-22M3 [preceding term published in Roman  letters and Arabic numbers]; and the "Arrow"-10M [preceding  three-character term published in Roman letter and Arabic  numbers] and "Needle" air defense missile systems.    However, the General Staff Headquarters stressed that the  weapons sold to the mainland are mainly defensive. Strategic  weapons such as rockets and nuclear weapons are not on the arms  sales list, they added.</p>

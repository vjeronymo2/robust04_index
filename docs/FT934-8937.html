			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / International Company News: Walt Disney's historical vision WALT DISNEY, the US entertainment group, yesterday announced plans to build a new theme park, featuring re-enactments of events in American history, on a 3,000-acre site in northern Virginia, just west of Washington, DC. The company said the park and a related shopping complex could open as early as 1998 if agreements on development were reached with local and state governments. It would create some 3,000 jobs in the area. Confirmation of the long-rumoured scheme came just 24 hours after Euro Disney, the Paris theme park in which Walt Disney has a 49 per cent stake, reported annual losses of Dollars 930m. Virginia is a growing tourist destination, with attractions which include the restored colonial village of Williamsburg and several theme parks, including those operated by Paramount Communications and brewer Anheuser-Busch. Disney said its park would be different from the others it operates which focus on Disney characters, in both subject matter and presentation. It would use new technology to allow visitors to 'participate' in historical events by, for example, piloting a world war two aircraft and taking part in Revolutionary and Civil War battle re-enactments. Visitors would also meet life like dummies of US presidents using Disney's audio-animatronics technology. The village, near the civil war battlefield of Bull Run, would also include a high speed 'thrill' attraction called the industrial revolution. The project has yet to receive planning permission, and complications here could scupper it: Disney abandoned a Dollars 3bn marine park in Long Beach, California, which it had announced in 1990, because of regulatory and environmental concerns. Congressional sources said the company hoped the Virginia park would attract up to 30,000 visitors a day.</p>

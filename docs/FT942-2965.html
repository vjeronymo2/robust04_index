			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / Blair wins strong backbench support Mr Tony Blair, Labour's leading moderniser, was yesterday nominated by 154 of the 269 MPs entitled to vote in the party's leadership contest, giving him an overwhelming lead in the race to succeed the late John Smith. The strong support among MPs for Mr Blair guarantees him 15.5 per cent of the votes in the party's leadership electoral college, and puts him well on the way to victory in the contest against Mrs Margaret Beckett and Mr John Prescott. However, last night the leftwing leadership of the Transport and General Workers' Union, the biggest union affiliated to Labour, decided by a substantial majority to recommend Mrs Beckett for the leadership. The decision, made after all three contenders addressed a meeting organised by the union, raised the prospect of a much closer battle for the votes of 4.3m union supporters. Mr Blair was backed by 13 of the 19 elected members of the shadow cabinet, including Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, and Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary. Mr Prescott, the traditionalist employment spokesman, was nominated by 46 MPs, including three shadow ministers. Mrs Beckett, the interim leader, won 42 nominations, but no shadow cabinet support. Mr Denzil Davies, a former Treasury minister running on a platform opposing European economic integration, drops out of the race after winning only seven nominations - 27 fewer than the threshold required to contest the election. Mrs Beckett won 106 nominations for the deputy leadership and Mr Prescott 101, suggesting that both will have to campaign intensively during the four weeks before voting ends on July 21. Both Mr Prescott and Mrs Beckett appeared to have had difficulty in crossing the threshold of 34 nominations required to contest the leadership. Mr Straw dismissed claims that Mr Blair's preference for the deputy leadership had been signalled by Mr Brown, a close ally, who nominated Mrs Beckett. Neither Mr Blair nor Mr Straw nominated a candidate for deputy, in an effort to maintain friendly relations with both candidates. Other friends of Mr Blair nominated Mr Prescott. The shadow employment spokesman said he was 'delighted' to have crossed the nominations threshold. Mrs Beckett said the nominations process had ensured 'a real choice' for the party. In the debate organised by the TGWU, Mr Blair indicated his growing self-confidence by rejecting the idea that all union legislation passed by the Tories since 1979 should be scrapped by a future Labour government. 'I don't believe it would be sensible to say we would repeal all the Tory trade union legislation,' he said. 'We want a positive framework of law. It allows us to go forward, not back.' But Mrs Beckett and Mr Prescott both pledged to work for the repeal of large sections of the Tory legislation. Earlier, the executive of the GMB general union decided not to nominate or recommend any of the candidates for the Labour party leadership.</p>

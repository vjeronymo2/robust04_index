			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Survey of World Electricity (1): From public to private - Many countries are privatising or restructuring their electricity industries. But none has yet rivalled the radical nature of the reforms in Britain, and EC efforts to encourage more cross-frontier competition have so far made little headway ELECTRICITY industries round the world are being restructured. But they are not, contrary to the predictions of Mr John Wakeham, Britain's former energy secretary, following the UK privatisation pattern. Nor is Europe moving towards the kind of free electricity market set up in Britain. UK privatisation itself has been a mixed success. Some analysts, such as Mr Andrew Johns of National Utilities Services, (NUS) are enthusiastic. 'It has enabled consumers to negotiate individual deals,' he says. 'There is no doubt that it has changed the face of electricity purchasing completely.' Most observers agree that privatisation has made the electricity industry leaner and meaner, and although it is too early to say whether it has brought prices down, most consumers appear to be better off. 'It has removed forever the CEGB mentality where you had engineers running the industry for engineers, and the government handing them a blank cheque,' says a financial consultant to the industry. 'The consumer now has a certain transparency when the CEGB was one of the most opaque organisations,' says Mr Gordon MacKerron of Sussex University's Science Policy Research Unit (SPRU). 'They now have a clear idea what nuclear costs, and have an incentive to develop new technologies such as renewable energy, which has moved ahead fast. Cross subsidies are more difficult - you can't have blatant political fixes for big consumers. 'It is also good to have gas-fired plant - although the craze for gas has gone too far. The CEGB's strategic planning function was pretty Stalinist - we would have just had more gigantic coal and nuclear plants.' But the market has detractors - and not only the large customers who have lost their government subsidies under the new regime. MPs on the Commons energy committee, and the electricity industry watchdog, Offer, are both concerned about whether enough competition is emerging in electricity generation. Meanwhile, other European countries are showing few signs of following Britain down the privatisation road. The EC itself has made efforts to introduce more competition, and to make the basis of electricity pricing more open, or transparent. But draft directives aimed at liberalising the electricity market have so far made little progress. In particular, several European countries including France and the Netherlands, are resisting efforts to introduce 'third party access' or TPA, which would open up national monopolies, allowing European suppliers to supply European customers across borders. This is mainly because of the many large public sector European utilities, which resist any encroachment on their protected franchises. There are also logistical problems with introducing cross border trading of electricity, such as establishing who pays for capital investment in the grid systems. If a German company's purchase of power from a UK generator means lines need to be reinforced to carry the extra electricity - who pays for the work? There would also have to be some equivalent of the UK 'pool' which acts as a central clearing and settlement agency for all deals. A Spanish supplier who is paid on contract by an Italian purchaser but fails to generate needs to settle up with the Italian national supplier who actually supplies. The chances of European countries adopting the UK 'pool' or wholesale market in electricity are small, most observers say, not least because the pool itself seems increasingly peripheral (some say unnecessary) to the UK market. But they will probably begin to unbundle their accounts, splitting generation from distribution and supply, to give more transparent pricing. Even if TPA does not develop across borders for some time, there will be more competition in supply within domestic markets. There has also been more of a trend towards restructuring than to privatisation. One group of European countries is still resisting any real change. France, Italy and Germany have not restructured their industries, and are broadly opposed to EC attempts to open their electricity markets. Belgium, which previously had three private companies, now has a private monopoly, Electrabel, over which the state has more control. It too, is opposed to radical market reform. Spain is more ambivalent. The country's utilities have been restructured: the biggest private electricity companies, Iberduero and Hidrol, merged to form Iberdrola, while Endesa, the state-owned company, has taken over two other utilities. Some shares have been issued in Endesa. However, Spain's enthusiasm for privatisation or for TPA is muted. Three countries making more significant moves towards a competitive market in electricity are Norway, Sweden, and Portugal. Portugal has invited private sector bids to build new power stations, notably a new oil-fired station north of Lisbon. The UK's PowerGen and National Power are among the international companies bidding for the business. The Portuguese electricity utility, Electricidade de Portugal, is also being restructured, and 'corporatised,' and will later be split into six separate companies. Some private capital may be injected into these companies later. In Sweden, meanwhile, the government has committed itself to introducing a free electricity market with full TPA by 1994. It has created a new Swedish National Grid, which may be partly sold off, but there are no firm plans for privatising Vattenfall, the dominant state-owned utility. The Norwegian system is perhaps the closest to the UK market, although no privatisation has taken place. Early this year, Norway began a radical restructuring of the electricity industry, which comprises the publicly-owned utility, Statkraft, as well as a number of privately and publicly owned electricity companies. Companies will be able to compete to supply customers, and will have open access to the electricity grid. Statkraft was recently split into two parts, a generating company, and a grid management company, giving the generating side more commercial freedom. Norway already has a spot market for surplus electricity, and it is thought that electricity contracts may be traded in the near future. Privatisation, for most European countries, is a political issue. If they are against it, it is often because their large public utilities are part of the framework of government. But in Asia, where electricity industries are also being restructured, privatisation is primarily an economic issue. In South East Asia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia plan to inject private sector capital into their cash-starved utilities. 'In the developing countries, privatisation is viewed primarily as a mechanism for raising funds,' says Mr Andrew Barnett, who heads Sussex University's Developing Country Group. 'There is a massive requirement for electricity, and a shortage of funding.' Some South East Asian countries, he says, have even had to resort to export credit finance, which is unsuitable for infrastructure projects. Privatisation will not necessarily mean utilities become more efficient, Mr Barnett says. 'Competition in generation is a good thing, but in developing countries it can mean a huge proliferation of small scale diesel generators which are efficient only in the narrowest sense.' Developing countries, he says, may experience considerable conflict between government policy on electricity, (for instance its fuel policy), the utility's plans, and the financier's requirements. That is also true where World Bank financing is concerned, he believes. The Bank has tended to encourage privatisation, but may come into conflict with what the state wants. Nevertheless, several Asian countries now plan partial privatisation of their electricity industries. Malaysia recently sold off 22.8 per cent of the capital of Tenaga Nasional, the state-owned electricity monopoly, which was 'corporatised' in 1990. The company is likely to be restructured further in the near future. In Thailand, meanwhile, EGAT, the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand, is still state-owned. However, the government will sell shares in three power stations which were recently set up as separate subsidiaries. Thailand is also one of many Asian countries including India, Pakistan, Malaysia and even China inviting private sectors to tender to build and operate new power stations. This has become a widespread practice in Asia. 'The impetus for privatisation may have come from the UK,' says Dr Tony Wheeler, manager at Ewbank Preece, an engineering consultancy which advises governments on restructuring electricity industries. 'The World Bank has jumped on the bandwagon too. These countries really need to raise capital - for instance Pakistan can only borrow enough to build one power station - and they need 10.' The country has long planned foreign investment in the power station it plans on the coast near Karachi, but has made little progress in agreeing a deal that suits all parties. Although the South East Asian electricity systems are typically modern and so in fairly good condition, Mr Wheeler believes bringing in private capital could help the countries become more efficient. 'Pakistan has 165,000 staff to sell 10,000MW - that does not look good for the efficiency of the organisation.' In South America, too, privatisation is underway. Argentina's aggressive privatisation programme led to the sale of Central Nuevo, a generating company created from the state-owned electricity monopoly Segba. The company is now owned by two privatised Chilean power companies, Chilgener, and Chilectra, which outbid European and US companies to win a 60 per cent stake in the company. Argentina plans to sell the whole of the electricity industry. Chile itself has already privatised its electricity industry: Endesa, Chile's largest electricity business, is one of the country's most profitable private sector companies. Although Mexico expects to keep the electricity utility in the public sector, it has invited private sector companies to bid to build electricity plant. A few other developed countries, notably Australia and New Zealand, are making some moves towards electricity privatisation. But this is unlikely to be in the near future, or to follow the UK model.</p>

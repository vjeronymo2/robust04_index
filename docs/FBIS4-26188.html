			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Willie Chu and Y.C. Tsai] </F>   [Text] San Francisco, June 16 (CNA) -- The Republic of  China [ROC] hopes to join the United Nations in order to make  more contributions to the prosperity and stability of the  Asia-Pacific region, ROC Foreign Affairs Minister Frederick  Chien said Thursday [16 June].    Chien made the statement in a panel discussion of the 1994  world forum in Beaver Creek, Colorado. The forum opened  Thursday and will continue through Saturday.    The forum, sponsored by the American Enterprise Institute,  annually brings together more than 100 ranking government  officials, senior business executives, and renowned academics  from around the world to exchange views on the world's major  concerns ranging from politics and regional security to economic  issues.    Dignitaries attending the 1994 forum include former U.S.  President Gerald Ford, Former French President Valery Giscard  d'Estaing and former British Prime Minister James Callaghan.    During the panel discussion entitled "Asia at Center Stage  --  Trade, Security, and Human Rights," Chien noted that Asia is  expected to contribute 50 percent to global economic growth in  the next decade.    Asia, which currently outperforms other world areas in  employment and inflation, is a major source of the U.S. trade  deficit, he pointed out, adding that how to narrow the trade  imbalance has become a major concern.    Moreover, he said, the ROC has played an important role in  the stability of the Asia-Pacific region. He also stressed that  the investments made by Taiwan manufacturers in Mainland China  have had a strong impact on the development of the mainland  economy.    The panel discussion was chaired by James Lilly, former  director of the Taipei office of the American Institute in  Taiwan and former U.S. ambassador to Beijing.    Chien, accompanied by his wife, arrived in Beaver Creek  Wednesday. This is the fourth consecutive year Chien has  attended the forum.</p>

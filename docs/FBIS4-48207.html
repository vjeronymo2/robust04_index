			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The latest Nigerian-supported  genocide against the innocent civilians has again opened sore  wounds regarding the neutrality of the Nigerian contingent  within the multinational peacekeeping force in Liberia. Angry  citizens in Gbarnga are calling on the leadership of the NPFL  [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] to demand the  unconditional withdrawal of the Nigerians from Liberia. The  citizens also accused ECOMOG field commander General John  Inienger, who is also a Nigerian, of misleading the people of  this country into believing that the Nigerians, for peace sake,  have turned over a new leaf only to realize that they are still  bent on the destruction of innocent lives and property.    Local and international observers say the activities of the  Nigerian troops within ECOMOG [Economic Community of West  African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] are in themselves an  obstacle to the peace process and that the only guarantee for  lasting peace is the complete withdrawal of Nigeria from the  process here. Since the inception of the civil crisis in  Liberia, the Nigerians have continued to create splinter armed  groups against the people of this country with direct support  intended to prolong the civil crisis.    Evidence has emerged in Monrovia that the latest upsurge in  fighting between rival ULIMO [United Liberian Movement for  Democracy in Liberia] factions is being fueled by arms sales to  both groups by ECOMOG. Intelligence sources in ECOMOG itself  have relayed that the Guinean and Nigerian troops within the  ECOMOG are involved in the sale of arms to the two fighting  tribes within ULIMO. Our sources said the sale of arms to rival  ULIMO factions involved some top-level personnel of the Nigerian  and Guinean contingents of ECOMOG.    The report said the economic gain of the sale is the main  factor behind the delay by ECOMOG to take any decisive step in  (?securing and end) to the fighting between the two ULIMO forces.    The Koromah group is mainly supplied by the Guinean troops  of  ECOMOG while the Krahn faction is being supplied by the Nigerian  contingent.</p>

			<p><P> May 3, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BROWN ASSAILS DEUKMEJIAN'S ASSAULT GUN FINES PROPOSAL  </P> <P> Assembly Speaker Willie Brown on Tuesday declared his opposition to a proposal  by Gov. George Deukmejian that current owners of assault guns who do not  register their weapons should merely be fined instead of charged with a  criminal offense.  </P> <P> "That's like a parking ticket," said Brown (D-San Francisco), asserting that  "some of us (Democrats) will not vote to make the possession of an assault  rifle an infraction."  </P> <P> It was unclear whether Brown's opposition would be enough to torpedo the  assault-gun ban, which has been strongly promoted by law enforcement leaders,  teachers and neighborhood activists fed up with street gang terrorism.  </P> <P> But Deukmejian's chief of staff, Michael R. Frost, who is helping craft an  expected compromise version of legislation to ban most semiautomatic weapons,  suggested that Brown might not be up to date on the negotiations.  </P> <P> Frost told a reporter, "There is going to be a fairly stiff fine associated  (with failure to register). I would expect (the Speaker) would support the  final version of the bill."  </P> <P> However, a spokeswoman for Brown later reiterated his determination to oppose  any bill "that makes it an infraction to (illegally) possess . . . any assault  weapons."  </P> <P> As currently written, bills by Assemblyman Mike Roos and Senate President Pro  Tem David A. Roberti, both Los Angeles Democrats, would make it either a felony  or misdemeanor for current owners of assault guns to fail to register them with  the state Department of Justice.  </P> <P> The governor maintains that the criminal penalties would be too tough on  otherwise law-abiding gun owners who refuse or neglect to register their  weapons. He has insisted that the penalty for failing to register an assault  weapon be an infraction, punishable with a fine much like a traffic citation.  </P> <P> Among other things, the pending legislation would require owners of assault  weapons who want to keep them to register the firearms by Jan. 1, 1991. To  qualify, the guns would have to be acquired lawfully by this June 1.  </P> <P> The bills would make illegal the possession of about 60 military-style assault  rifles, pistols and shotguns. Punishment could range from a $1,000 fine and one  year in the jail to a term in state prison of up to three years.  </P> <P> Each measure has passed both houses in different forms and is awaiting final  action.  </P> <P> </P> <P> More Time  </P> <P> Deukmejian announced his opposition to criminal penalties for failing to  register the weapons shortly after he asked Roberti on April 19 to hold up  expected final passage of his bill. The governor said he needed more time to  study the measure and offer amendments.  </P> <P> Since then, Roos, Roberti and Deukmejian have met privately once to discuss  their differences. Their staffs, however, have conducted a series of  negotiating sessions in an effort to reach a compromise.  </P> <P> "We are now in the area of dealing with technical aspects of the bill," Frost  said Tuesday after a negotiating session. "I don't think there are substantive  major policy differences at this point. It is really in the fine-tuning area."  </P> <P> But Brown, who has mostly played a cameo role in the Legislature's effort to  ban assault guns, told a press conference that he opposes the infraction  penalty as "watering down the bill."  </P> <P> The Speaker did not, however, indicate that his opposition to the infraction  penalty would be enough to kill the proposal. He did voice concern that  negotiations tend to "reduce the urgency and courage quotient" in many  legislators who have supported the measure.  </P> <P> According to Brown's press secretary, Susan Jetton, the Speaker believes that  while some Democrats would not vote for the bill with the infraction provision,  Republicans who previously opposed it would vote for it because it would bear  the governor's clear-cut endorsement.  </P></p>

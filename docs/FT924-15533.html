			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Banks calls US findings on BCCI 'offensive' THE Bank of England yesterday fiercely denied accusations by US senators that it failed to regulate Bank of Credit and Commerce International properly, condemning part of the criticism as 'misconceived and offensive'. In an unusually strong public statement, the Bank made a detailed rebuttal of charges in a Congressional inquiry led by Senator John Kerry (Democrat, Massachusetts) which accused the Bank of 'wholly inadequate' regulation of BCCI. The Bank said it would not respond formally to an inquiry which it believed had employed 'deficient procedures', but it wanted to deny 'a number of allegations about the Bank for which there is no factual basis of any sort'. Senator Kerry's office reacted to the Bank's statement by saying: 'Mr Kerry stands by the report.' The war of words between Congressional investigators and the Bank broke out the day after the publication in Washington of the report of a four-year inquiry by Senator Kerry and Senator Hank Brown (Republican, Colorado). The report said the Bank had received evidence of BCCI fraud in the spring of 1990, but had 'colluded in the suppression of the true facts' until the spring of last year, when it co-ordinated the worldwide closure of BCCI. However, the Bank said yesterday that to suggest it had been 'even inadvertently a party to a cover-up of criminality is misconceived and offensive'. It also denied entering any deal with the government of Abu Dhabi not to close BCCI. The Bank, which initially responded to the report by saying it could not comment because it was awaiting the publication of the inquiry into BCCI supervision by Lord Justice Bingham, was highly critical of the senators' methods. 'The procedures under which this investigation operated were, in the Bank's view, unjust and have led to allegations about the Bank which have no basis in fact,' it said. The Bank denied telling BCCI's auditors Price Waterhouse to certify BCCI's accounts in 1989. The report said that Price Waterhouse would not have certified the accounts unless it had been guided to do so by the Bank. The Bank also disputed a central tenet of the Kerry report, that the investigation by Mr Robert Morgenthau, the New York district attorney, had triggered BCCI's closure. The Bank said it had acted independently of Mr Morgenthau's investigation. The Bank and Price Waterhouse insisted that neither had given evidence to - or been interviewed for - the Kerry inquiry. Senator Kerry's office denied Price Waterhouses claim that the committee had not responded to the firm's offer to come and talk to it in London. 'We prepared a subpoena against Price Waterhouse of the UK asking that they talk to us. But the US lawyers for Price Waterhouse told us point blank that they wouldn't even accept the subpoena,' a senate staff member said. Senator Brown said last night that the Bank had refused a request for access to information concerning BCCI, which had been made through the Federal Reserve Bank. He said the Bank had thrown a 'veil of secrecy' over its actions. The report's findings were based on public documents and represented 'what we believe to be an objective analysis of their contents'.</p>

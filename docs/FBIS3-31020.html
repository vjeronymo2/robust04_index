			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 11 Feb (TANJUG) -- In reaction to the  latest developments in and around Bosnia-Herzegovina, FRY  [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] President Zoran Lilic has sent  a telegram to UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali.    According to the FRY President's Office, the telegram says  that the FRY upholds the European Union's proposal on resolving  the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina, as well as the agreement on a  cease- fire and the demilitarization of Sarajevo signed by the  Bosnian Serb and Muslim sides.    The FRY president stresses that this gives Yugoslavia all  the  more reason to be concerned over NATO's perplexing decision to  search for a solution through ultimatums and military might, and  adds that such decisions could invoke the continuation of the  war, while peace can only be achieved through negotiations on an  equal footing. NATO's decision is an unauthorized assumption of  the UN Security Council's political competences by this military  alliance.    President Lilic also says that the FRY is firmly convinced  that the United Nations alone is authorized to reach such  political decisions, especially concerning the use of force.    The FRY president also appeals to the UN secretary general  to  take all necessary measures in order that the UN Security  Council may regain its usurped political rights in resolving the  crisis in former Bosnia-Herzegovina [as received], which would  ensure a successful outcome of the Geneva peace process.</p>

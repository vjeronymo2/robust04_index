			<p><P> December 21, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HAYDEN CHAIRMANSHIP COULD GO TO FRIEDMAN  </P> <P> Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Los Angeles) is a leading candidate to become  chairman of the Assembly Labor and Employment Committee, a post being vacated  by Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), according to legislative sources.  </P> <P> Friedman -- whose district includes Sherman Oaks, Topanga and other Santa  Monica Mountain areas of the western San Fernando Valley -- on Thursday  acknowledged that he had sought the appointment from Assembly Speaker Willie  Brown (D-San Francisco).  </P> <P> Friedman, elected in 1986, has not served as chairman of a major standing  committee in the Assembly.  </P> <P> "Of what I understand is now available, this is the one I want," Friedman said,  citing his interest in issues handled by the panel such as worker safety,  plant-closing notices and employment discrimination.  </P> <P> Michael Reese, Brown's press secretary, said "no final decision has been made  on the labor committee."  </P> <P> Another name legislative sources have mentioned as a possible labor chairman is  Assemblywoman Teresa P. Hughes (D-Los Angeles).  </P> <P> Reese would not comment on specific candidates.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, Hayden announced that he was stepping down from the labor  committee chairmanship, a post he has held for the past two years.  </P> <P> He will accept the chairmanship of a new Assembly Higher Education Committee.  </P></p>

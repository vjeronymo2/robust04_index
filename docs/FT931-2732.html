			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Technology: Word for word in Japan - Worth Watching Japanese commuters could soon find a new way of buying their railway tickets. Gone will be the man behind the counter and the push button ticket machine. In their place will be a computer which recognises spoken requests. This is just one scenario envisaged by NEC for its voice recognition system which will be marketed in Japan this year. The machine can be programmed to recognise 1,000 words which are relevant to each particular application. The machine uses a technique developed at NEC's media research laboratory in Kawasaki, called demi-syllable speech recognition. Each syllable is dissected and analysed. NEC: Japan, 03 3798 6520.</p>

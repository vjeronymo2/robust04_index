			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Markets: It's party time - but will the Fed join in? - Wall Street US investors started 1994 in confident fashion this week, buying enough stocks to push the Dow Jones Industrial Average through 3,800 for the first time. But the broader market missed out on the new year celebrations: the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 barely moved. The gains on the Dow, and the lack of movement in the S&amp;P, indicates that investors are responding to the latest evidence of economic strength by pinpointing the shares of those companies likely to benefit most directly from the acceleration in the pace of business activity. This move into stocks sensitive to the economic cycle was most evident in the impact the buying had upon transport issues. The Dow Jones Transportation Average - which includes airlines, rail, freight and road transport companies, all of which prosper alongside a buoyant economy - climbed 2.3 per cent in the first four trading days of the week, finishing Thursday's session at a record high of 1,802.21. While transport and cyclical stocks climbed, other sectors languished. In particular, small and medium sized growth company stocks, and those sensitive to interest rates, are increasingly out of favour. These sectors tend to perform best when an economy is struggling to pull out of a recession. This is because, in difficult economic times, investors seek out companies with earnings on a fast-growth track that is independent of the business cycle. They also invest in companies - such as utilities, banks and securities houses - which are most likely to gain from the decline in interest rates that usually accompanies a period of below-par growth. Yet, the economy is now showing signs of considerable vigour and, in such a climate, the rate of earnings growth at the big industrial companies begins to catch up with growth rates of smaller growth-oriented companies, making the former group's stock look a more attractive buy. Also, a stronger economy brings the likelihood of higher interest rates, which takes the shine off utility companies, banks and securities houses. There can be little doubt that the economy is growing, and quite rapidly. This week brought more good news in the form of an increase in the National Association of Purchasing Management's monthly survey of nation-wide manufacturing activity, in construction spending, and in factory orders. There was also yesterday's all-important December jobs report. Although the headline number was below market expectations - non-farm payrolls increased by 183,000 last month, and not by well over 200,000 as analysts had forecast  -the report gave investors the best of both worlds. While the figures proved strong enough to sustain the belief that conditions in the labour market are improving (albeit slowly), the fact that they came in below market forecasts delighted the bond market, which had been troubled all week in case the jobs report was extremely bullish on the economy. Some analysts went so far as to say that the weaker-than-expected December employment report could delay any tightening of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. Everyone expects the Fed to push up rates soon to dampen inflationary pressures in the economy, but the big question is when. In the past, the employment report often has been the trigger for a Fed easing or tightening, and the thinking on Wall Street is that the Fed will wait to raise rates until it sees clear signs of dynamic growth in the labour market. Consequently, the stock market has at least another month's grace period, possibly more, before facing a possible rate hike. How investors react when rates do rise is another matter. The answer depends on whether the many who have shifted out of short-term assets and into equities over the past three years are fickle enough to take their money out of the stock market at the first sign of an increase. While there are some analysts who warn that many investors will be scared out of equities by rising rates, the majority believes that the flood of money into stocks since 1990 has been the result of changing demographics and attitudes, rather than a simple knee-jerk response to very low interest rates. Investors, the theory goes, have been buying equities for the long term, to save for their children's education and their own retirement. It is a compelling argument. Yet, it will not be tested when the Fed makes its first move on interest rates because yields on short-term assets will have to rise substantially from present levels before they look an attractive alternative to stocks. No, the real test will come when the Fed makes its second, third or fourth move on interest rates, and that could be as far off as 1995. Monday       3756.60 + 02.51 Tuesday      3783.90 + 27.30 Wednesday    3798.82 + 14.92 Thursday     3803.88 + 05.06 Friday       3820.77 + 16.89</p>

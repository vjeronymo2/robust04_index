			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Government Bonds: Bundesbank rate move underpins European sentiment THE BUNDESBANK'S decision to cut one of its short-term interest rates yesterday raised hopes of a further easing and provided a boost for German and other European government bond prices. Bund prices received further encouragement from news in the afternoon that the Russian parliament chairman, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, said he did not favour the impeachment of President Boris Yeltsin. Early in the trading session, the Bundesbank said it had cut its three-day Treasury bill rate from 8.4 per cent to 7.5 per cent, which is the same level as the discount rate. Economists pointed out that the move should give the Bundesbank more freedom to cut its repo rate and allow the call money rate to fall lower. 'The move went down very well in the market as it means the Bundesbank will probably lower the discount rate further in the next couple of months,' said Mr Julian Callow, European economist at Kleinwort Benson. 'The three-day T-bill rate has traditionally been above the discount rate, so now that they are at the same level it creates the impression that the discount rate will come down,' he added. The bund futures contract opened at 95.26 and rose steadily to a high of 95.67 towards the close of trading. The release of disappointing inflation figures from one of the western German states yesterday had little impact on the market. Consumer prices in the state of Baden-Wurttemberg rose 0.4 per cent in the month to mid-March and were up 4.3 per cent from a year earlier. LONGER-DATED UK government bonds continued to slip as dealers marked down prices ahead of next week's gilt auction, while short- and medium-dated issues traded in a relatively narrow range. Dealers said the  1/8 to  1/4 -point drop in prices among long-dated issues reflected pre-auction positioning of the market. The Bank of England will auction Pounds 3bn of a new 20-year stock - the 8 per cent gilt due 2013 - on March 31. JAPANESE GOVERNMENT bond prices were pushed sharply lower yesterday by a combination of yen weakness and a stock market rally. The June futures contract, which closed on Wednesday at 109.80, traded in a range of 108.99 to 109.65, before ending the day at 109.03. The yield on the benchmark No 145 issue opened at 4.09 per cent and moved between 4.065 per cent and 4.15 per cent, before ending the Tokyo session at 4.135 per cent. The bond market opened on a weaker note, due to the yen's fall against the US dollar. Dealers reported some buying interest on weakness late in the Tokyo session. US TREASURY prices were mixed yesterday afternoon, and trading was fairly subdued despite a successful auction of Dollars 11bn five-year notes. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond fell  11/32 to 103 9/16 , yielding 6.840 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was  1/16 higher, to yield 3.908 per cent. There was reasonable interest in the afternoon five-year note auction, with yields of 5.19 per cent, below expectations. The bid-to-cover ratio was better than usual, at 2.64-to-1, above the average in the last six Dutch auctions. There was no need for the Federal Reserve to intervene in the open market, with Fed Funds trading at 3 per cent, the Fed's target for the rate.</p>

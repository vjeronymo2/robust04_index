			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Silviya Velikova] </F>   [Text] The Bulgarian Social Democratic Party [BSDP], Civic  Alliance for the Republic [GOR], and the Greens Party signed an  agreement today on political cooperation and friendly relations.  The document signed by the leaders of the three political  parties states that only the national unification of the  democratic political forces, based on a clear and specific  program, will provide Bulgaria with a new political choice. The  three parties intend to work together to found a political  alternative to the existing confrontational bipolar model and to  draft documents and programs to resolve the main problems  relating to the country's development.</p>

In the previous 12 months pre-tax profits were Pounds 719,000 on turnover of Pounds 32.2m. The net interest charge fell from Pounds 486,000 to Pounds 144,000. Losses per share were 13.2p (earnings 0.9p). During the period there was a Pounds 6.7m rights issue which left Fortress Trust with a 25 per cent stake. Directors said the first quarter's trading was satisfactory. The shares rose 3p to close at 30p.</p>

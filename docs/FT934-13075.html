			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / ANC, government agree on mobile phones and fuel A MEASURE of economic peace returned to South Africa yesterday when breakthroughs were achieved on two lingering disputes over cellular telephone licences and a petrol price rise. Threats by the African National Congress to nationalise the cellular telephone industry and by the trade unions to implement a mass action programme to resist a petrol price rise had done much to sour the optimism following the lifting of economic sanctions. Yesterday, however, a joint statement from the ANC and government said Vodacom and Mobile Telephone Networks, the two companies issued with licences to operate cellular networks, could proceed 'as soon as possible' with the establishment of their networks. The basis for the rapprochement was that the ANC backed away from its threats to nationalise the operators in exchange for the two companies agreeing to increase black participation. At the same time the government yesterday announced that the petrol price would be dropped by two cents a litre from October 30. This decrease follows widespread protest against the 7 cents a litre hike announced on September 15. When, two weeks ago, the government refused to accept advice from the National Economic Forum (NEF), where business, labour and government are represented, to put the price rise on hold, trade unions and taxi-drivers threatened mass action. Cosatu, South Africa's largest union grouping, welcomed the announcement, but said it still wanted the full 7 cents rolled back. It still has to decide on whether to pursue any action. The NEF has urged that the whole structure of the liquid fuel industry, including pricing, needs urgently to be reviewed.</p>

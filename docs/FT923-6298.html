			<p>920825 FT  25 AUG 92 / International Company News: TWA agrees plan for reorganisation with creditors TRANS World Airlines, the debt-burdened carrier operating under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code, yesterday said it had reached agreements in principal with its creditors and all of its employees on a stand-alone reorganisation plan, paving the way for the airline to emerge from bankruptcy protection. A spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) cautioned, however, that 'to my knowledge, TWA's announcement is premature. I doubt there's any ink on paper right now'. According to the airline, ALPA, along with the International Association of Machinists and the Independent Federation of Flight Attendants have agreed to provide unprecedented three-year wage, benefit and work rule concessions in exchange for a 45 per cent stake in the reorganised airline. Creditors would receive 55 per cent of the equity in the reorganised airline, as well as debt securities and preferred stock. Mr Carl Icahn, TWA's owner, would inject Dollars 200m in cash and would cancel more than Dollars 170m in face debt. He would also cede control of the airline. 'Eliminating Carl Icahn and his senior management team and replacing them with a professional airline management team committed to TWA's long-term viability was one of our pre-conditions to any agreement,' said the ALPA spokesman, 'and that does not appear to be one of the outstanding issues'. An important sticking point appears to be the unprotected portion of the pilots' pension fund. TWA's pension plan is believed to be underfunded by about Dollars 1bn, and the unprotected portion of the pilots' pension fund is about Dollars 232m. Another outstanding issue is the pilots' demand for job protection if there is a further asset sale. Once an agreement is reached with union representatives, it would still need membership ratification by the rank and file of each union. It would also need bankruptcy court approval. However, 'I think getting the agreement would be an enormous first step,' the ALPA spokesman said.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 7.1.6&blank;Data Recorder Resolution. Review the output from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calibration error test; the COMS data recorder shall provide output  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capable of being resolved into 0.5 percent opacity increments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7.2&blank;Preliminary Field Adjustments. Install the COMS on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affected facility according to the manufacturer's written  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instructions and the specifications in section 4, and perform the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following preliminary adjustments:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7.2.1&blank;Optical and Zero Alignment. When the facility is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in operation, optically align the light beam of the transmissometer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> upon the optical surface located across the duct or stack  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i.e., the reflector or photodetector, as applicable) in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordance with the manufacturer's instructions; verify the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alignment with the optical alignment sight. Under clear stack  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions, verify the zero alignment (performed in section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7.1.1) by assuring that the monitoring system zero response for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the installation zero check coincides with the instrument actual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> zero measured by the COMS as set for the monitor pathlength prior  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to installation. Record these values. Adjust the instrument  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actual zero response, if necessary, and only if a clear stack  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> condition exists. Then, after the affected facility has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> started up and the effluent stream reaches normal operating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temperature, recheck the optical alignment. If the optical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alignment has shifted, realign the optics.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Note: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  Careful  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consideration should be given to whether a ``clear stack''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> condition exists. The stack shall be monitored and the data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> output (instantaneous real-time basis) examined to determine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether fluctuations from zero opacity are occurring before a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clear stack condition is assumed to exist. Check and record the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> upscale calibration value.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7.2.2&blank;Optical and Zero Alignment (Alternative Procedure).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The procedure given in section 7.2.1 is the preferred procedure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and should be used whenever possible. However, if the facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is operating and a zero stack condition cannot practicably be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obtained, use the zero alignment obtained during the preliminary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustments (section 7.1.1.2) before installing the COMS on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stack. After completing all the preliminary adjustments and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tests required in section 7.1, install the system at the source  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and align the optics, i.e., align the light beam from the transmissometer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> upon the optical surface located across the duct or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stack in accordance with the manufacturer's instruction. Verify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the alignment with the optical alignment sight. The zero alignment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conducted in this manner must be verified and adjusted, if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary, the first time a clear stack condition is obtained  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> after the operation test period has been completed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7.3&blank;Operational Test Period. Prior to conducting the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operational testing, the owner and operator, or the manufacturer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as appropriate, should have successfully completed all prior  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing of the COMS. After completing all preliminary field  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustments (section 7.2), operate the COMS for an initial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 336-hour test period while the source is operating. Except  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during times of instrument zero and upscale calibration checks,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the owner and operator must ensure that they analyze the effluent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gas for opacity and produce a permanent record of the COMS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> output. During this period, the owner and operator may not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> perform unscheduled maintenance, repair, or adjustment. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> owner or operator may perform zero and calibration adjustments,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposed optical and other CEMS surface cleaning, and optical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> realignment only at 24-hour intervals. Automatic zero and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calibration adjustments, made by the COMS without operator  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intervention or initiation, are allowable at any time. During  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the operational test period, record all adjustments,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> realignments, and exposed surface cleaning. At the end of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operational test period, verify and record that the COMS optical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alignment is correct. If the operational test period is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interrupted because of source breakdown, continue the 336-hour  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period following resumption of source operation. If the test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period is interrupted because of COMS failure, record the time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when the failure occurred, after the failure is corrected, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 336-hour period and tests are restarted. During the operational  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test period, perform the following test procedures:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7.3.1&blank;Zero Calibration Drift Test. At the outset of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 336-hour operational test period and at each 24-hour period,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> record the initial (Reference A) zero calibration value and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> upscale calibration value (UC Value), see example format  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> figure 1&hyph;8. These values are the initial 336-hour value  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established during the optical and zero alignment procedure (see  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 7.2.1). After each 24-hour interval, check and record  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the COMS zero response reading before any cleaning and adjustment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Perform the zero and upscale calibration adjustments,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposed optical and other instrument surface cleaning, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> optical realignment only at 24-hour intervals (or at such shorter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intervals as the manufacturer's written instructions specify).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If shorter intervals of zero and span adjustment are conducted,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> record the drift adjustment. However, adjustments and cleaning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must be performed when the accumulated zero calibration or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> upscale CD exceeds the 24-hour drift specification ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 2 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opacity). From the initial and final zero readings, calculate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the zero drift for each 24-hour period. Then, calculate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> arithmetic mean, standard deviation, and confidence coefficient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the 24-hour zero drift and the 95 percent confidence interval  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> using equations 1&hyph;3, 1&hyph;4, and 1&hyph;5. Calculate the sum of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> absolute value of the mean and the absolute value of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> confidence coefficient, and report this value as the 24-hour zero  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> drift. At the conclusion of the 336-hour operational test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period, record and report the 336-hour accumulated drift.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

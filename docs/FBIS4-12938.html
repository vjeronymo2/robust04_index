			<p>BFN     [Text] Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, head of the Palestinian  delegation to the peace negotiations, has held Israel fully  responsible for the escalation of acts of violence in the  occupied territories. In a statement last night, 'Urayqat was  quoted as saying that the acts of violence are generated by the  Israeli occupation troops' daily massacres targeting the  Palestinian people. He stressed that ending the Israeli  occupation of the occupied territories and halting the Israeli  Army's acts of terrorism is the only way to end the acts of  violence.</p>

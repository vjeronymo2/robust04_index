			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: MPs seek facts on Lamont donation THE WATCHDOGS on MPs' financial dealings have stopped short of launching an inquiry into Mr Norman Lamont's alleged failure to report an Pounds 18,000 donation from Conservative party sources to help pay his legal bills for evicting a tenant, Ivo Dawnay writes. Instead, the Commons' committee on members' interests yesterday asked three Labour backbench complainants to give more details of the alleged breach of rules. It offered the chancellor an opportunity to tell his side of the story. The committee is scheduled to meet again next week to examine the question further. The complaint from Ms Alice Mahon, Mr Alan Milburn and Mr Geoffrey Hoon argued that Mr Lamont should have registered the payment to comply with strict rules governing MPs' financial dealings. The committee must first decide whether the donation was a private gift or whether it could be deemed to relate to the chancellor's performance of his duties as a member of the House.</p>

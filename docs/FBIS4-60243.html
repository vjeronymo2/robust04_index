			<p>BFN     [Text] The cabinet was given a detailed report on the  commando operation [to abduct Mustafa al-Dirani], the reasons  for it, and its planning. Speaking on behalf of the cabinet,  Prime Minister Rabin praised the defense forces and the chief of  staff. On another issue, security officials told the cabinet  the Palestinian police force and administration face serious  problems in establishing their authority. Jack Katzenell  reports:    [Begin recording] [Katzenell] Now that the euphoria  surrounding the arrival of the Palestinian police is over, the  new leadership has to cope with the drab reality of raising  funds to pay salaries, a security official told the cabinet.  There is a shortage of trained personnel, weapons, food,  vehicles, and above all money to pay the salaries, the official  said. Nabil Sha'th brought a few hundred thousands dollars when  he made a brief visit to the Gaza Strip last week. Arab mayors  have been holding fund-raising drives, and Israel is paying the  salaries of 37,000 Civil Administration employees up to the end  of this month. But Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said the  money contributed so far by the donor countries is much less  than what they promised. In the ruling council for the  autonomy, portfolios have not yet been distributed, and this is  making it more difficult to organize the new administration.  The Palestinian police have called on the population not to  carry arms in the streets. In some parts of the Gaza Strip the  police have begun planning the collection of weapons from the  population. But Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] has warned  that it will not hand in its weapons, and the Popular Front of  George Habash says it will not give up its weapons so long as  Israeli soldiers or settlers are present anywhere in the  territories.    Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin again warned that Israel  expects  the Palestinian police to make sure that armed terrorists do not  enter Israel. So long as the security problem is not solved the  total closure of the Gaza Strip will continue, Rabin warned.    Minister of Commerce and Industry Mikha Harish said clearly  the PLO has an interest in showing that it can impose order in  Gaza and Jericho, and Israel is prepared to wait for a while:    [Harish] This process will be tested in a few weeks. If  there is going to be a serious progress in a few weeks then we  know that we are in the right track.    [Katzenell] If not?    [Harish] If not, then the agreement is collapsing, and they  are aware of that.    [Katzenell] The cabinet was told that the Fatah Hawks and  other local Palestinians who were on the wanted list are  disappointed, because they have not been incorporated in the new  police force or administration. Former policemen who resigned  at the beginning of the intifadah have not been reenlisted, and  feel they have been discriminated against relative to the  newcomers from the diaspora.

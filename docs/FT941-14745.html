			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / UK to share in Hercules project Lockheed, the US aerospace group, said yesterday UK companies would make up to 15 per cent of its proposed new version of the veteran Hercules transport aircraft, the C-130J. Launching a campaign to secure a Royal Air Force order for 30 new Hercules for Pounds 750m-Pounds 900m, it said the UK share would be roughly the same as on the rival European project, the Future Large Aircraft. British Aerospace is lobbying for government backing for the European venture. Lockheed and its UK partners estimate the UK would obtain Pounds 1.2bn of work from the C-130J programme on a 'conservative' forecast of 400 sales worldwide, 'significantly more' than the value of the UK purchase. They claim the programme would support 1,500 British jobs in the high-technology industry. The RAF has about 60 older-model Hercules. The Ministry of Defence, which is expected to decide by the end of the year whether to refurbish or replace half of this fleet, is due to invite a formal bid from Lockheed shortly. Lockheed has so far signed up 18 UK companies for the project, including GEC-Marconi, Hunting, Westland, Lucas and the TI subsidiary Dowty, which will manufacture the propellers. The UK companies have already invested about Pounds 70m in the programme, in which Lockheed is investing about Pounds 200m. Lockheed is looking to the UK as the lead customer for the four-engined aircraft, which is outwardly similar to the previous Hercules in service since the 1960s. Other customers include Australia, with an initial requirement of 12 new aircraft, New Zealand and Saudi Arabia. The US is also believed to have a requirement for about 250 aircraft to replace older Hercules transports. British Aerospace, which fears it will be forced out of the European FLA project if the UK government continues to refuse to back it, is understood to have declined an invitation to join the Lockheed programme. However, Mr Gordon Williams, chairman of Hunting Aviation, part of the Lockheed consortium, said yesterday the C-130J project was not in conflict with the FLA. The European aircraft would be a contender to replace the second batch of RAF aircraft, he said, but would not be available until about 2003. The Lockheed aircraft was 'the only realistic contender' for the first batch, expected to be required in 1996, he said. The new C-130J would have a 35 per cent greater range than its predecessor.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The rationale for the order of questions is that cement kiln dust should first be considered to present risk to human health or the environment or a potential risk under plausible mismanagement scenarios before the Agency considers it for regulation under RCRA subtitle C. Second, before it considers regulating the waste under subtitle C, the Agency should determine that current management practices and existing state and Federal regulatory controls are inadequate to limit the risks posed by a waste. Then it should consider whether subtitle C regulation would be effective and appropriate. Finally, the special statutory status of the waste requires that the Agency consider the impacts to the industry that regulation under subtitle C would create in making a decision to regulate the waste as hazardous. Therefore, the decision rationale allows EPA to systematically narrow its focus as to whether the waste may present significant risk of harm and whether additional regulatory controls are necessary and desirable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The tentative answers to the questions posed in its three-step decision rationale are discussed below:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Step 1: Does management of CKD pose human health and environmental problems? Might current practices cause problems in the future?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After reviewing evidence of damage to human health and the environment, performing a risk assessment, and reviewing the results of laboratory analyses of waste samples, EPA has concluded that risks associated with CKD management are generally low, however, there is a potential under certain circumstances for CKD to pose a danger to human health and environment, and may do so in the future.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Data collected from state files and EPA site visits identify common CKD waste management practices, including management in exposed, unlined piles, abandoned quarries, and landfills, that have caused, and may continue to cause, contamination of air and nearby surface water and ground water. Management practices such as disposal in a water-filled quarry and management in piles adjacent to grazing and agricultural fields or surface water bodies also pose a potential danger to human health and the environment. In addition, risk modeling results supports the conclusion that CKD can potentially pose risks to human health and the environment under certain hypothetical, yet plausible scenarios.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Step 2: Is more stringent regulation necessary or desirable?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has reached no conclusions with respect to the need for more stringent regulation. EPA's preliminary analysis of the effectiveness of State and Federal regulations and controls suggests that additional controls should be evaluated; for example, controls for CKD management scenarios which potentially present high risks, if those scenarios exist. While CKD is regulated under State and local laws, the specific requirements for CKD vary from state to state. In many instances, minimal controls are applied to these wastes. Also, recycling technologies could be used as a means to improve waste management practices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Step 3: What would be the operational and economic consequences of a decision to regulate CKD under subtitle C?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Operational costs of CKD regulation are largely dependent on the management alternative selected. If CKD is managed as a hazardous waste under RCRA subtitle C, facilities that manage their CKD through on-site land disposal are estimated to incur significant compliance costs. However, the financial burden of compliance, even for waste dust generated in kilns that burn RCRA hazardous waste, may be reduced, if facilities are able to adopt pollution prevention technologies which recycle CKD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The possible economic outcomes of a decision to regulate CKD under RCRA subtitle C cover a broad spectrum. An economic analysis of innovative pollution prevention technologies (including alkali leaching, flue gas desulfurization, and fluid-bed dust recovery), suggests that the potentially high compliance costs of CKD land disposal may drive the industry toward more recycling of their CKD. However, at this early stage of their development, it is uncertain that these recycling technologies can be widely adopted by the industry. Moreover, even if CKD is recycled, some facilities may incur substantial disposal costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> D. Regulatory Options  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> This section presents a series of options the Agency is considering concerning the management of cement kiln dust waste based on the findings of this Report. In accordance with RCRA section 3001(b)(3)(C), EPA will make a regulatory determination for cement kiln dust waste after submitting this Report to Congress, and after holding a public hearing, and accepting and reviewing public comments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As stated previously, cement kiln dust waste generally presents a low inherent toxicity, is only rarely characteristically hazardous, and, in most cases based on risk modeling, does not present a risk to human health and the environment. However, cement kiln dust waste may pose a potential threat to human health and the environment considering plausible worst case conditions under certain hypothetical management scenarios (see Chapters 5 and 6). Major factors increasing the potential for human health and environmental damages include proximity to potential exposure points such as agricultural fields and surface water bodies, as well as the concentrations of key constituents of concern.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the findings, and an initial evaluation of regulatory options, the Agency has not decided whether to retain or remove the CKD exemption. The Agency considered a number of options which represent a wide range of scenarios that would subject CKD to different management requirements and enforcement oversight. From these, the Agency has chosen to highlight five, including three in which CKD would be managed under subtitle C, with the intent to focus public comment from environmental groups, industry, and other interested parties regarding the most appropriate approach to manage CKD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

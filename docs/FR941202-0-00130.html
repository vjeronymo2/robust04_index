			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FAA is adding three definitions and amending a third definition to make the drug testing rule clearer and to parallel the alcohol testing rule. ``Contractor company'' is defined to mean ``a company that has employees who perform safety-sensitive functions by contract for an employer.'' ``DOT agency'' is defined to mean ``an agency (or `operating administration') of the United States Department of Transportation administering regulations requiring drug testing (14 CFR part 61  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ; 46 CFR part 16; 49 CFR parts 199, 219, and 382) in accordance with 49 CFR part 40.'' The FAA is also adding a provision to clarify current requirements concerning access to records. The provision provides that an employer required to conduct random drug testing under the anti drug rules of more than one DOT agency shall provide each such agency access to the employer's records of random drug testing, as determined to be necessary by the agency to ensure the employer's compliance with the rule. This provision is designed to resolve some confusion regarding compliance monitoring of multi-modal pools.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Implementation Dates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on the 1992&hyph;1993 data submitted to FRA and FAA, the railroad and aviation industries may begin testing at a minimum 25 percent random rate beginning January 1, 1995, because their positive rates were less than 1.0 percent in 1992 and 1993. Pipeline and marine employers will continue testing at 50 percent until they have 2 years of data showing that random positive rates for their industries are less than 1.0 percent. If the positive rates are below 1.0 percent for 1994 and 1995, then testing rates may be lowered to 25 percent beginning January 1, 1997.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interstate motor carriers are currently testing at a minimum 50 percent testing rate and will continue to do so until the positive rate for the entire motor carrier industry (both interstate and intrastate and motor coach operations) is less than 1.0 percent. Large intrastate motor carriers will begin random drug testing at a minimum 50 percent testing rate on January 1, 1995, and small intrastate motor carriers will begin random testing at a 50 percent rate on January 1, 1996. We will allow the motor carrier industry to reduce its testing rate to 25 percent beginning on January 1, 1998, if the 1995 and 1996 data for those required to conduct random testing under the FHWA rule demonstrate a positive rate of less than 1.0 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Large transit operators will begin random drug testing at a minimum 50 percent testing rate on January 1, 1995, and small transit operators will begin random testing at a 50 percent rate on January 1, 1996. If the 1995 and 1996 data for large transit operators combined with the 1996 data for small transit operators demonstrate a positive rate of less than 1.0 percent, we will allow the transit industry to reduce its testing rates to 25 percent beginning on January 1, 1998. Industries that do not meet the criterion will continue to test at a minimum 50 percent random testing rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Analyses and Notices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The final rule is considered to be a significant rulemaking under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, 44 FR 11034, because of the substantial public and Congressional interest in this subject. A regulatory evaluation has been prepared and is available for review in the OST docket. This final rule was reviewed by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs pursuant to Executive Order 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FAA estimates an average potential cost savings of approximately $9 million per year for the aviation industry if the testing rate is dropped to 25 percent. USCG estimates an annual cost savings of between $0.8 million to $1.6 million annually for maritime; RSPA estimates $1.4 million or more per year for pipelines; FRA estimates $1 million per year for the railroad industry; FHWA estimates $107 million per year or more for motor carriers; and FTA estimates an average of $7 million per year or more for transit. Further detail is available in the OST final regulatory evaluation and the OA preliminary regulatory evaluations, which are available in the respective dockets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12612  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final rule has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that it does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

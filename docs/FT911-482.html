			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Arts: Penelope rediscovered - Faure's neglected masterpiece OPERA DE Nantes, one of the strongest of the French regional companies, has revived Penelope (Monte Carlo, 1913), Gabriel Faure's only opera. It is a work I have loved with a passion since getting to know it from the score half a lifetime ago; later encounters via radio broadcasts and then via recordings with Regine Crespin and Jessye Norman only increased the enthusiasm. Penelope is very seldom done (the 1970 production at the Royal Academy of Music, which I unfortunately missed, is the only one mentioned in the annals over last two decades). Seeing it a first time in the theatre fulfilled a wish that lasted, unfulfilled, even longer than Ulysses's absence from Ithaca. Often, first encounters of this kind contain an element of disappointment: one comes to understand that there are sound (if not necessarily admirable) reasons for the absence from the schedules of this or that favourite rarity. Not here: after last Friday's performance I insist more forcefully than ever that this is a crazily neglected masterpiece. Exactly like The Trojans before it was widely seen, Penelope is an opera enshrouded in critical myth. Most of the textbooks tell us that it is worthy but undramatic, the late fruit of a composer who was essentially a miniaturist, a chamber-music thinker, and above all not a man of the theatre. In the actual experience none of this is borne out - least of all the untheatrical charge - but it is easy to work out how such misunderstandings could come about. Throughout his life Faure's tastes in opera (he was a committed Gluckian and Mozartian, a clear-eyed but not idolatrous Wagnerian, and a foe of Italian verismo) and his distaste for obvious effects might be taken for those of an artistic monk, incapable of even contemplating, let alone producing, a properly effective (in all senses) theatre composition. Yet, as Andrew Porter pointed out on this page after that 1970 RAM production, on those very few occasions when rediscovery has been permitted, it is exactly the work's reserves of theatrical power, its culmination in climaxes of elevated grandeur, that can so enthral the newcomer. In truth, it is a 'quiet' opera (analogously, Faure's is a 'quiet' Requiem). The pace is moderate - but has Parsifal ever been deemed undramatic on that account? To begin with, the musical motifs out of which each act is woven seem undemonstrative, the scoring (which, according to false legend, the composer left entirely to other hands) discreet, the mood elusive. In fact, the dramatic pull soon proves inexorable. The late-Faure musical language elicits an atmosphere of chaste, classical decorum - which in all three acts is then broken into, fierily, by the incursion of the disguised dramatic-tenor Ulysses. Penelope is not lacking in 'moments'; indeed, it is studded with airs, melodic units in the style of late-Faure songs, expanded in scale and emotional range until the whole opera becomes a tissue of song-turned-into-opera of ineffable radiance. The characters are sharply defined: not just the glorious dramatic soprano (or high-mezzo) title role, or Ulysses, but all of the smaller parts - nurse, shepherd, quintets of serving-maids and suitors. In spite of his criticisms of Rene Fauchois's libretto (directed at its wordiness, and the difficulty of keeping a disguised Ulysses credible for three acts), Faure reached to its core. As Martin Cooper once wrote, 'In Penelope the much-vaunted affinity of the French and the Hellenic genius does appear and finds what may be its classic expression'. What proves so theatrically unexpected about this affinity is the revelation of the Dionysiac as well as the Apollonian aspects of Faure's classicism: the fire burning within the noble edifice. Penelope is unfashionable: perhaps, like Gluck's mature operas, it always will be. In presentation it demands focus on the music, on the words (the intimacy of the Nantes opera house was ideal), on the 'moral' ethos of the whole dramatic treatment. Any staging that takes a modish 'critical' slant, that substitutes production tricks for concentration on the performing powers of the leading players, will surely collapse in ignominy. The Nantes production had got its values right. It was not an entirely gimmick-free piece of stagecraft - the producer, Christian Gangneron, put Penelope and her maids in ancient Greek costume and the suitors in modern European - but by current French standards its modesty of style was otherwise startling, and its ensemble was admirably cast. Neither the Orchestre des Pays de la Loire nor the house chorus is of the front rank; under the patient, profoundly musical guidance of the veteran French conductor Jean Perisson, the achievement surpassed all built-in limitations. The most impressive feat was to find two convincing exponents of Penelope and Ulysses. Isabelle Vernet, whose song recital at last year's Aix Festival I praised so highly, is Regine Crespin's star pupil. All who love French opera must pray that she continues to develop out of the limelight: for in potential she is the French soprano the world is waiting for. The voice is not yet 'finished'. Its use is not always free of breathy impurity. But in warm, tender utterance of words, in unforced stage command, in emotional shades and nuances, Miss Vernet surpassed all hopes. Mark Baker, the young American whose Florestan was last year shown to Glyndebourne Touring audiences, needs to work on his French words, which were clear but sometimes bluntly accented. The youthful power and freshness of the tone lent the chastely sculpted phrases a thrilling lift. The final-curtain cheers, bravos and foot-stamping of the Nantes audience suggest that the promise of the house brochure had been kept: this was indeed 'the highlight of the season'. Now it's time for a British house to take on Penelope.</p>

In Kigali [words indistinct] today, Ambassador  Andre Katabarwa, a former minister and ambassador and former  managing director of the Public Electricity, Water and Gas  Production, Transport and Distribution Company in Rwanda was the  victim of a grenade attack. The grenade was thrown by attackers  disguised as mechanics repairing a motorbike near Mr. Andre  Katabarwa's home.    The would-be assassins waited for Mr. Andre Katabarwa to go  past them at 1215 to commit the atrocity. Mr. Andre Katabarwa  was hit in the fingers, thighs, and ribs. His watchman, who  opened the gate of the compound, was also wounded. The car was  heavily damaged.    Mr. Katabarwa, who was taken to hospital, received treatment  and returned home as his injuries were not judged serious.  Witnesses interviewed said that [word indistinct] gendarmes  were patrolling in a vehicle near Mr. Katabarwa's home while the  attackers were pretending to repair their motorbike. The  gendarmes' vehicle disappeared immediately after the attack  against Mr. Katabarwa. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920627 FT  27 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Improved Pounds 2.87m from Syltone Syltone, the maker of specialist ancillary equipment for the transportation industry, lifted pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.73m to Pounds 2.87m in the year to March 31. Turnover advanced from Pounds 33.7m to Pounds 34.9m. Mr Tony Clegg, the chairman, said the result had been achieved despite a serious setback at Rotocold, the vehicle refrigeration and air conditioning subsidiary. Looking ahead, he said the company would continue to explore new opportunities and markets. A final dividend of 6.3p (6p) is proposed for a total of 9.45p (9p), payable from earnings of 22.22p (22.18p) per share.</p>

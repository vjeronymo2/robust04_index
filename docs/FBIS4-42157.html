			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, chairman of the Russian  Liberal Democratic Party, is demanding millions of markkas in  damages from Finns for defamation. Zhirinovskiy has accused the  Swedish Theater in Helsinki of linking him with Hitler and the  newspaper HUFVUDSTADSBLADET of describing him as "mad."  According to Zhirinovskiy's representative, several other  similar suits against Finnish newspapers and television programs  are currently being considered. Marja-Helinae Peltonen reports:    [Peltonen] During his visit to Finland this spring, Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy authorized his Scandinavian representative, George  Paile, and his company to deal with articles and performances  that Zhirinovskiy feels insult him. The first two claims for  damages have now been submitted to Helsinki district court.  According to Zhirinovskiy's representative, it is likely that  several other court cases will be brought during June.  Zhirinovskiy's representative says that the two claims  submitted to Helsinki district court are the first court cases  of their kind concerning Zhirinovskiy in the West.    One of the claims concerns the Swedish Theater in Helsinki.  The first night of the play "Mein Kampf," directed by Dick  Idman, was in February and the last performance has already been  given, i.e., the play is no longer being programmed.  Zhirinovskiy or his representative have not previously voiced  their displeasure to theater director Georg Dolivo. [passage  omitted]    The other claim today is connected to an article in the  newspaper HUFVUDSTADSBLADET written by journalist Jutta  Zilliacus. The article that offended Zhirinovskiy was published  in mid-April. Zhirinovskiy finds the word "mad" used about him  in the article as offensive. The claims for damages in the two  cases submitted to Helsinki district court total about 15  million Finnish markkas.</p>

			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / International Company News: Number of loss-making US national banks falls THE number of loss-making commercial banks in the US is declining, according to a report by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the US regulatory agency. The report said the number of unprofitable national banks was lower in the first nine months of 1992 than it had been in many years. For the first nine months of this year losses were reported by some 278 banks, or 8 per cent of national banks. This compared with an average of 681 banks, or 16 per cent of the total, which had suffered losses in the first three quarters of each of the previous five years. The OCC report said national banks disclosed aggregate profits of Dollars 4.66bn in the third quarter of 1992, nearly Dollars 3bn higher than the aggregate total in the same quarter of last year. The improvement in bank profits came in large part from rising net interest income and gains on the sale of investment securities, both of which benefited from low interest rates. Over the past two years big banks had increased their holdings of investment securities, including Treasury securities, by Dollars 80bn, or 25 per cent, the OCC said.</p>

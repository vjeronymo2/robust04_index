"The Zionists are too anxious to deal with a Syria without  another Hafiz al-Asad, so the incident raises many questions,"  said the daily KAYHAN. "We cannot exclude a role here for US and  Israeli agents."    The newspaper said Basil was the most appropriate  replacement  for his father and Syria's "only hope" to continue the "tough  political heritage" of Hafiz al-Asad, who has ruled the country  for 24 years.    The paper added that Basil was his father's confidant, often  chosen to launch secret negotiations on Hafiz al-Asad's behalf,  particularly with the Lebanese Shiite Moslem fundamentalist  group Hizballah.    Basil al-Asad, an Army major who was being groomed to  succeed  his 63-year-old father, died on Friday aged 31. He was buried  on Saturday in the family's home village of al-Qardahah in  northern Syria, at a funeral attended by several Arab leaders  and some 100,000 mourners.    Basil's death came less than a week after Asad and US  President Bill Clinton held a summit meeting in Geneva in a bid  to revive the Arab-Israeli peace process, which Iran fiercely  opposes.    In a condolence message to Asad on Saturday Iranian  President  'Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani described Basil's death as a  "tragic event."</p>

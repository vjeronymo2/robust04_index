			<p>BFN     [Text] Construction is due to start within the next week  on the first stage of a project to pipe offshore gas from Bach  Ho oil field to Ba Ria in southern Vietnam.    According to the Ministry of Energy, construction will start  on April 9. The first stage includes collecting gas from Bach  Ho oil field and building a pipe line from Bach Ho to the Ba Ria  power plant. The pipeline will include 10 km under the sea and  20 km on land.    This stage is expected to be completed by September this  year  to directly supply gas to turbines in the Ba Ria power plant.  The associated gas of the Bach Ho oil field will replace oil  currently being used at 50 percent cheaper price.    The capacity of the first stage will be about 300 million  cubic meters a year. The second stage will begin in 1994 and  complete at the end of 1995 or early in 1996.    Investment in capital construction for the first stage is  valued at about $100 million and about 15 billion Vietnamese  dong, equivalent to $1.5 million.</p>

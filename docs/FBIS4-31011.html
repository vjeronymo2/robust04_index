			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 31/5/1994 -- Indian President  Shankar Dayal Sharma, now on an official visit to Romania,  addressed the two chambers of Romania's Parliament in joint  sitting on 31 May.    The Indian president conveyed to Romania "the fraternal  salute of India's Government, Parliament and people." He spoke  of freedom and democracy and showed that where there was freedom  of thought and expression the most differing views could be set  forth, to the benefit of democracy.    The visit by the Indian president, who is accompanied by a  delegation of ministers and parliamentarians, is the first visit  after 1989 by an Asian head of state to Romania.    Romanian Senate President Oliviu Gherman assessed in his  welcoming address that India was a potential supporter of the  development of Romania's relations with other Asian states. He  also hoped Romania would be able to be in turn a European gate  for India.</p>

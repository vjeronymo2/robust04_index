			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] A ceremony has been held in the Croatian  National Theater in Split to mark the third anniversary of the  formation of the 114th Brigade of the Croatian army, the first  reserve brigade. The ceremony was attended by families of dead  Croatian defenders, invalids of the patriotic war, high military  and civilian officials, and by Corps General Janko Bobetko,  chief of staff of the Croatian Army. Sandra Stanic reports:    [Stanic] [passage omitted] Speaking about the beginnings of  the brigade, Corps General Janko Bobetko stressed that many  pages of Croatian history will be written by soldiers and  officers of the 114th Brigade. There are many tasks ahead of  us, the corps general added, and one of the fateful ones is to  preserve what we have achieved, to return to Croatia every inch  of the occupied land and to organize ourselves to be a model  democratic and happy country.    [Begin Bobetko recording] We must thoroughly prepare our  army  and the Croatian people for the final task. If it is our fate  to do that -- and we will do it with pleasure and  conscientiously -- there will be no skirmishes, we will go to  the end, to the last inch with all our force and all means  available. We have let them know this very clearly. We must  say and everyone must know that the Croatian state and the  Croatian Army have the potential to do that. When and how they  will use that potential, that is a question of decisions and  estimates. Our task is to be prepared for it and to be up to  the task. [end recording] [passage omitted]</p>

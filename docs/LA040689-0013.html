			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NICARAGUA AND EL SALVADOR  </P> <P> I refer to "New U.S. Policy on Contras Told," Part I, March 25:  </P> <P> You state that under a bipartisan agreement, $45 million of humanitarian aid --  for food and shelter -- will be provided the Contras over a period of 10  months. Based on a 12,000 troop count, this sum equates to $375 per month per  Contra, or approximately $65 more than the general relief paid to the destitute  by Los Angeles County -- and an even greater differential when compared to the  relief provided in other areas of the U.S. where the cost of living is less.  And many of those on relief live on the streets -- or in shelters, if they can  be found -- because affordable housing is just not available.  </P> <P> It is difficult to justify Contra support as a funding priority over needed  social programs which, we are told by our legislators, cannot be provided  because of budget deficits. With inadequate housing, food, medical care, and  education, it is apparent that the poor in this country are effectively the  source of the $45 million for the Contras.  </P> <P> BENNETT L.

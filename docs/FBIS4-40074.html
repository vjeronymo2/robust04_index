			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev declared  today that ending international sanctions against the Bosnian  Muslims might return the world to a state of cold war and even  push it into a third world war. He expressed his view to  journalists, according to a REUTER report, after a meeting in  Moscow with Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, who has  arrived in the Russian capital to receive a literary prize.    As is known, the other day the U.S. Congress decided on a  unilateral dropping of the embargo on arms supplies to the  Muslim side in the Bosnian conflict. The head of the Russian  Foreign Ministry noted that Russia, for its part, will not be  taking similar steps vis-a-vis the Bosnian Serbs unless they are  connected with a peaceful settlement of the crisis.</p>

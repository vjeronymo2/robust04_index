			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLACING THE BLAME FOR THE CONDITION OF ROCK 'N' ROLL  </P> <P> The real downslide first appears in the '70s when there was no clear-cut, bona  fide phenomenon for that decade along the lines of Elvis or the Beatles (Elton  John came close, but nowhere close enough).  </P> <P> The '80s were further confounded by several acts vying for this position --  Jackson, Springsteen, Prince, etc.  </P> <P> But there is no real need to worry. Because of rock's historical impact,  whatever replaces it would have to transcend it and be more exciting in the  eyes of adolescents. Side genres such as rap, disco or techno-pop are not  strong enough to override it. They've just bought rock 'n' roll more time.  </P> <P> FRANK BEESON  </P> <P> West Los Angeles  </P></p>

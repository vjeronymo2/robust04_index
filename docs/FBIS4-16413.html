			<p>BFN     [Text] The news service of the Union of Georgia's Citizens  reports that a meeting of the board of the Union of Georgia's  Citizens has been held in the large hall of the Cinema House.    The first issue on the agenda was a speech by Giorgiy  Zhorzholiani, deputy chairman of the Union, who presented a  brief outline of major trends and forms of the board's activity  during the period following the congress [held in March 1994].    The board confirmed the commission chairmen. It was pointed  out that the Union of Citizens is already beginning to put its  practical measures into effect.    Speaking during debates on determining the political course  of the Union, which was the final issue on the agenda, the  chairman of the Union of Young Citizens has said that there  would be a danger of having an amorphous and unmanageable  organization unless the Union were experienced emotionally as an  incorporated organism. In addition, it is essential that  mistakes should be avoided like those made during the  confirmation of members of the government.    The state treasury was said to be allocated to people who  have not yet passed either a patriotism test or an honesty test.  It was also noted that the Union's approval rating would  decrease sharply unless a serious program was drafted to be  presented to the electorate.    According to Zurab Zhvania, general secretary of the Union,  there are many serious problems in the Union, but talks about  the danger of disorganization are rather exaggerated.    Union Chairman Eduard Shevardnadze made a closing speech,  and  the board passed a resolution.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Commentary" by Chu Ke (2806 1356): "The United States </F> Must Curb Its Habit of Interfering in the Internal Affairs of  Other Countries"]    [Text] Hong Kong, 14 Mar (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--When  meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Christopher on 12 March,  Foreign Minister Qian Qichen pointed out frankly that, before  Christopher visited China, "in disregard of China's laws, a  senior U.S. official took actions which interfered in China's  internal affairs when visiting China in preparation for the  state secretary's visit." It is generally believed that Qian  Qichen was referring to Shattuck, U.S. assistant secretary of  state for human rights, who openly met with Wei Jingsheng on an  official visit to Beijing last month. In China, Wei Jingsheng  is a criminal who has been released on parole. It was a  transgression of protocol for a U.S. official -- in the country  on an official visit -- to meet privately with a person who, for  China, is a criminal.    It was no coincidence that a U.S. official did something  which did not respect the law of another country. More  recently, when an American youth, Michael Fay, was sentenced to  four months' imprisonment and caning by a Singapore court for  creating graffiti and accepting stolen property, U.S. President  Clinton suggested that Singapore reconsider the sentence.    One typical shortcoming of the U.S. Government is the idea  that U.S. law is the law of laws and is universally applicable.  If the law of a land differs from or contradicts U.S. law, it  is automatically viewed as wrong in some way or not perfect  enough, and the United States will even interfere with it.    The same goes for human rights problems. Some people in the  U.S. Government seems to think that the United States is a  paragon where human rights are concerned and that only American  standards of human rights can serve as a guide for the rest of  the world. In fact, these people only look at other countries  and ignore numerous domestic situations which flout  international human rights norms. The situation of the Native  American Indians is a case in point. The U.S. Government and  American society have been treating the Indians unfairly, yet  there have never been any "human rights warriors" in the United  States taking any moral actions to address the history and  present reality of the systematic annihilation of Indian  culture. The U.S. Government doesn't care that prisons in  California and Oregon use prisoners as cheap labor and then  export these prison products.    In the minds of the Americans, none of the Asian countries  have "promoted human rights" in the past. During the era of the  bipolar world order, many countries were lashed by the whip of  U.S. "human rights" concepts and dared not raise any objections.  Today, Asian countries can openly tell the United States that  there are regional considerations in human rights, and,  moreover, the right to regional development is one of them.  This principle was expounded at last year's UN Conference on  Human Rights. However, the U.S. Government is still violating  this principle all the time and is continuing to interfere in  other countries' internal affairs with its own human rights  standards. The interference in China's human rights and  Singapore's judiciary both originated from the same  psychological background and show that the United States still  has a hegemonic mentality.    In fact, with the disappearance of the bipolar international  system, a multipolar world order with a diverse political,  social, economic, and cultural situation has appeared. This  diversified world order values mutual respect and mutual  noninterference. If the United States continues to act in a  hegemonic style and intervenes in other countries at the  slightest excuse, it will, in the near future, find that the  regions will react strongly to counter such interventions.</p>

The Corporation may enter into a written agreement with the debtor permitting the debtor to repay the debt in installments if the Corporation determines, in its sole discretion, that payment of the amount due would create an undue financial hardship for the debtor. The written agreement shall set forth the amount and frequency of installment payments and shall, in accordance with &sect;1408.12, provide for the imposition of charges for interest, penalties, and administrative costs unless waived by the Corporation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The written agreement may require the debtor to execute a confess-judgment note when the total amount of the deferred installments will exceed $750.

The oral hearing, however, shall not be an adversarial adjudication and need not take the form of a formal evidentiary hearing. All significant matters discussed at the hearing, however, will be carefully documented.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Any review required by this part, whether a review of the written record or an oral hearing, shall be conducted by a hearing official.

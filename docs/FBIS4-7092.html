			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Shoichi Totani] </F>   [Text] What draws one's attention about Tsutomu Hata, the  next prime minister, are his ties with business circles as it  can mean direct links with "money" sources. Hata will replace  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, whom the public had hoped  would tear down collusion among politicians, bureaucrats, and  businessmen, but ended up resigning over "suspected dirty money"  cases involving himself. Hata, whose selling point is his  "clean" image, appears to have nothing to do with business  circles at first glance. But "support groups" for him have been  formed one after another since the beginning of the Heisei era  [1989], and he is surrounded by business leaders as much as  other powerful politicians are.    The "biggest" support group for Hata is the "Uyu-kai,"  composed of members of metropolitan business circles.  Representatives of this group are Ken Moroi, chairman of  Chichibu Cement Corp.; Sho Nasu, chairman of Tokyo Electric  Power Corp.; and Yoshihisa Tabuchi, adviser to Nomura Securities  Corp. Among members of the group are Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman  of Toyota Motor Corp. (next chairman of Keidanren [Japan  Federation of Economic Organizations]); Tadahiro Sekimoto,  president of NEC Corp.; and top executives from Japan's 38  leading companies like Nissan Motor Corp., Toshiba Corp., Nippon  Telegraph and Telephone Corp., Sumitomo Chemical Corp., Seiyu  Corp., and IBM Japan. Since the first year of the Heisei era,  the group has met two or three times a year.    The "Shinshi-kai" is composed of about 30 members, including  business leaders from Nagano Prefecture, Hata's home prefecture,  and top executives from companies having close ties with Nagano.  Representatives of this group are Yoshio Nakayama, honorary  president of Cosmo Oil Corp.; Yoshio Maruta, chairman of Kao  Corp.; Kaneo Fujimori, adviser to Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank; and  Shigenobu Yamamoto, adviser to Hino Motors Corp.    There is no particular support group composed of graduates  of  Seijo University, Hata's alma mater. But Ryoichi Kito, who is  the president of the machine tool maker Kito (head office in  Yamanashi Prefecture) and was Hata's senior at Seijo High  School, serves as a representative of the "Shisui-kai" which is  made up of top executives from 15 firms of middle standing.    What is noteworthy is that all of those support groups  formed  in the Heisei era. An official of Hata's office claimed: "This  has happened only because Mr. Hata gained power and made a name  for himself during his days in the Liberal Democratic Party."  Many business leaders, meanwhile, said: "We were impressed by  the stand of Mr. Hata who tackled the political reform issues  seriously, risking his political life."    Mitsuo Fukawa, who is president of Nisshin Oil Mills Corp.  and a graduate of Seijo University, supported this view, saying:  "Mr. Hata is a good-hearted man who carried though his resolve  (in political reform and other major issues)."    So far, Hata has not always had strong influence on business  circles, however. A "Uyu-kai" member asked more of him, saying:  "His connections with business circles are more extensive than  those of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. I should say his  connections are more extensive, but shallower. He presens a  clean image on money matters, and there is nothing more to ask  of his personality, but that is not good enough for a prime  minister. He should learn to exert more leadership."</p>

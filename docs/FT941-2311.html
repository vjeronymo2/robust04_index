			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / S African jail riot kills 21 Twenty-one prisoners were killed and more than 100 others were injured in rioting at jails in South Africa yesterday after protests by inmates demanding voting rights in next month's elections, agencies report from Johannesburg. The most serious incident took place in a prison at Queenstown, in the Eastern Cape, where 21 prisoners suffocated after setting their communal cell ablaze. More than 2,000 prisoners went on the rampage at Pietermaritzburg prison, in Natal, and prisons spokesman, Colonel Barry Eksteen, said warders fired teargas in an attempt to control the inmates. He said some 120 people were injured. Prisoners on death row at Pretoria jail also joined the protest, setting 18 cells alight, and destroying bedding and furniture. The authorities gave no details of casualties.</p>

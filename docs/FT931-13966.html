			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Counting the cost of weathering ERM storm: Resilient krone sees off the speculators THE upheavals in the EMS have left Denmark with high short-term interest rates and an abrupt loss of competitiveness in important export markets. But, in spite of a prospective change of government, Denmark appears to have weathered the crisis - and the central bank is proclaiming victory. 'Defence of the krone has not cost us a thing. It has cost the speculators, who have lost,' said Mrs Kirsten Mordhorst, vice-president of the Danish National Bank. The UK, Sweden, Finland, Norway and the southern European countries - all of whose currencies have fallen in the past few months - together account for about a third of Denmark's exports. But this has not yet dented Denmark's current account surplus, about DKr25bn (Pounds 2.6bn) last year, or 3 per cent of GDP. Furthermore, the domestic political turbulence which erupted last week with the resignation of the prime minister, Mr Poul Schluter, has had a positive impact on financial markets. The krone has strengthened against the D-Mark, the one-month Copenhagen interbank offer rate has fallen by more than 2 percentage points to 15, the all-share index fell 4.7 points in two days, but bond prices have risen. Firmness on financial markets in part reflects the view that the new Social Democratic government, expected to be installed later this week, will be in a better position than Mr Schluter's administration to secure a Yes to the Maastricht treaty when it is submitted to a second referendum this spring. In spite of only sluggish Danish economic growth, the markets are also impressed by inflation of only 1.4 per cent for the latest 12 month-period. Mr Erik Hoffmeyer, the national bank governor, now says that in all important respects Denmark's economy is more stable than Germany's. Short-term interest rates have nevertheless been high for long periods. Some companies have been paying loan rates of up to 20 per cent. According to Mr Michael Teit Nielsen, economist at the Federation of Small Enterprises, this is creating a vicious circle. 'As equity capital is eroded the banks are less and less willing to lend money,' he said Despite the national bank's optimistic view, Denmark is as eager as any other EC country to see the Bundesbank making significant cuts in interest rates.</p>

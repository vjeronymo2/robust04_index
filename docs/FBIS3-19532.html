Pasqua said that in Paris the protest drew up to 35,000  people, two-thirds of them students and the rest union  supporters. Union leaders had put the total at 50,000.    In other French cities and towns, between 180,000 and  200,000  people took part in protests, Pasqua said.    The demonstrations were called to denounce a government plan  to fight unemployment by letting businesses pay young people  less than the minimum wage.    In Paris, demonstrators burned about a dozen cars and threw  stones at police and occasionally at union leaders.</p>

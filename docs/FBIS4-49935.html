			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO Reporter Pi Shuyi (4122 2885 5030) and </F> XINHUA Reporter Jiang Jun (1203 6511): "The Commodity  Inspection Departments of Our Country Should Strictly Hold the  Pass of the Import and Export Commodity Quality"]    [Text] Along with the sustained increase in the import and  export volumes of our country's foreign trade, the task for well  holding the pass of the import and export commodity quality  becomes heavier and heavier with each passing day. To safeguard  the interests of the state and consumers, the staff members and  workers of the commodity inspection departments throughout the  country have made efforts to carry out reforms and keep forging  ahead and promoted the rapid development of the commodity  inspection cause.    The reporters learned of the fact from the national meeting  of commodity inspection bureau directors held on 5 May that  positively responding to the strategy for "winning victory in  foreign export trade through quality," commodity inspection  departments have strictly conducted inspections and guarded the  pass. The import and export commodities inspected last year  were valued at $75.18 billion. Of this, 11,065 batches of  export commodities were found unqualified, valuing at $301  million. The goods owners were instructed to sort out or change  their goods. Thus, the reputation of the state has been  safeguarded. Simultaneously, 12,814 batches of import  commodities were found unqualified, valuing at $1.53 billion.  Commodity inspection certificates were timely issued to the  departments concerned for claiming damages from foreign  countries. Some $186 million of compensation funds were paid.  According to the "regulations on banning unlawful transit of  textile products" promulgated by the Ministry of Foreign  Economic Relations and Trade, the General Customs Office, and  the State Commodity Inspection Bureau, the commodity inspection  departments of all localities inspected the marks of export  textile products and prevented more than 300 batches of export  textile products from exports.    To solve the problems of fake and poor-quality products  exported through the border trade which has rapidly developed  over the past years, the commodity inspection department and the  departments concerned especially investigated and studied these  problems on several occasions and reflected the situations to  the State Council in a timely manner. The commodity inspection  department, the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and  Trade, and the General Customs Office jointly issued the  "Circular on Strictly Banning the Exports of Fake and  Poor-Quality Commodities," and revised and made public the  "methods for inspecting the commodities exported and imported  through the border trade." Simultaneously, the establishment of  commodity inspection organs at border trade ports was  accelerated. Methods for linking on-the-spot inspections with  pursuing for a permanent control were adopted to manage the  commodity inspections. Strict measures, including expanding the  scale of sample surveys and turning over goods for inspections,  were adopted to especially inspect the commodities relating to  the people's safety and public health, the ordinary commodities,  and the commodities easily mixed with fake commodities. The  commodity inspection department also worked in coordination with  the departments concerned to strictly handle a number of  enterprises and businessmen that manufactured and sold fake and  poor-quality export commodities. Thus, the trend that fake and  poor-quality commodities were wantonly exported through border  trade channels has effectively been brought under control.    The commodity inspection organs at various levels have  positively conducted self-reform. Some commodity inspection  bureaus changed their laboratories with conditions into  relatively independent inspection entities which could join the  market competition. A small number of inspection and appraisal  entities were changed into independent corporations. Market  intermediate organizations, including quality attestation and  property appraisal organizations, were growing up. On the basis  of this, some commodity inspection bureaus begin to  appropriately separate administrative management functions from  specific inspection functions. To suit the demands for  expanding the scale of opening the coastal and border areas and  the areas along the rivers to the outside world, last year, 31  new commodity inspection organizations were established, 26  preparatory organizations were approved, and six Sino-foreign  jointly invested inspection and appraisal organizations were set  up.</p>

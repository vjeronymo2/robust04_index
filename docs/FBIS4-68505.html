			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Aleksey Chernychev: "New Source of Replenishing </F> the City Budget Is Found in the Business Sector"]    [Text] Beginning 1 May of this year, mandatory  licensing of activities of all economic entities in the sphere  of trade, public catering, and consumer services for the  population, regardless of their form of ownership and  departmental affiliation, goes into effect in the kray center.  According to the city administration press center, a  corresponding decree was signed recently by acting Mayor of  Vladivostok Konstantin Tolstoshein.    These actions by the city authorities were undertaken in  carrying out the decree of the head of kray administration dated  24 February 1994 "On Introducing Mandatory Licensing of  Activities in the Sphere of Trade, Public Catering, and Consumer  Services for the Population."    In accordance with the decree at the city level, the  aforementioned licensing will be carried out by the Committee  for Entrepreneurship, Trade, and Consumer Services of the  Vladivostok Mayoralty; the right to sign licenses has been  delegated to its chairman, Yuriy Terskiy.    As Mr. Terskiy told NOVOSTI correspondent, his committee is  currently preparing to begin issuing licenses. It is known that  all enterprises conducting economic activities in four spheres  of entrepreneurial activities--liquor sales, retail trade,  public catering, and consumer services for the population--are  to undergo the "licensing purgatory."    Beginning 1 May the price of a license for each point of  sale  (kiosk, stand, store, cafe, etc.) engaged in one of these four  activities will be R30,460. Entrepreneurs of all forms of  ownership will have to pay separately for their right to conduct  business in each of the four listed categories. In the event a  certain point of sale is intended both for retail sales and  consumer services for the population, the proper license will  cost R60,920.    According to Yuriy Terskiy, by introducing new rules for  licensing activities in the sphere of trade and so on, the city  will get a reliable source of additional budget revenue. The  actual scale of this additional revenue will be clear after 1  May.</p>

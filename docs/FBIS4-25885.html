			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, June 15 (XINHUA) -- The stocks listed in  the Hong Kong stock market by nine Chinese mainland state  enterprises are eagerly sought after by investors.    These enterprises have raised 11.385 billion Hong Kong  dollars by issuing 5.551 billion shares since July last year  when they were first listed in Hong Kong.    This figure made up four percent of the total overseas  investment in the Chinese Mainland last year.    These enterprises include the Qingdao Brewery, the Shanghai  Petrochemical Works, the Beiren Printing Machinery Plant, the  Anhui Maanshan Iron and Steel Complex, the Yizheng Chemical  Works and the Tianjin Bohai Chemical Works.    According to experts here from Hong Kong's market, the  reason  why the "H"-shares are popular in Hong Kong is because these  mainland enterprises, which are backed by government policy,  have valuable property and their products have a ready market.    It was learned that 22 additional mainland enterprises are  expected to get listed in the Hong Kong market this year.</p>

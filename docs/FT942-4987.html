			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Kmart investors dig in heels over discount record: Richard Tomkins explains how the US retailer has provoked a shareholder rebellion Low prices were the foundation on which Kmart, the US discount store group, grew to become the world's biggest retailer, but it was never the intention that this reputation should extend to its shares. Now, angry shareholders are signalling that they have had enough. At the company's annual meeting on Friday, dissident institutional investors delivered a humiliating blow to Kmart's management by throwing out its plans to create new shares tied to the earnings performance of its speciality stores. Shareholder activism is nothing new in the US. Many big US companies - including another retailing giant Sears, Roebuck - have been forced into changes of direction as a result of shareholder pressure. Several - including General Motors, International Business Machines and Eastman Kodak  -have lost their chairmen or chief executives along the way. But what has gone wrong at Kmart to provoke shareholders into such a public attack? Shortly after Mr Joseph Antonini became chairman and chief executive in 1987, he proclaimed in a newspaper interview: 'My goal is to make Kmart the most respected dominant retailer in America.' Briefly, the company won that respect in 1989 when it overtook Sears, Roebuck to become the world's largest retailer. But already, analysts were predicting that the discount store group most likely to succeed in the 1990s was not Kmart, but its rival Wal-Mart Stores. They were right. In 1990 Wal-Mart swept past Kmart to claim the number one slot. In terms of sales, profits and share price, it has soared ahead ever since. Analysts say that Wal-Mart is quite simply the better retailer. Kmart has too often had to sell off goods cheaply to get rid of them, or run out of things people want to buy. But there is another factor. Kmart has baffled shareholders with its repeated changes of direction. In the 1980s, it decided to use the cashflow from general merchandising to enter speciality retailing. It bought or set up the PayLess Drug Stores chain, the Waldenbooks and Borders book stores and the Sports Authority shops, among others. Confusingly, however, it also set about expanding its general merchandising activities by making forays into the hypermarket and membership businesses, first by taking a stake in the Makro hypermarket chain and then by buying the Pace Membership Warehouse operation. Both these ventures proved unsuccessful. The basic strategy went awry when Kmart realised that its discount stores would not generate the expected surplus cash because they needed so much investment to survive the competition from Wal-Mart. But the refurbishment programme was abruptly scaled back in 1992, when Kmart considered re-entering the hypermarket business. Then in January this year, it said the results from its refurbished stores were so good that it was starting up the programme again. Meanwhile, the PayLess Drug Stores chain disappointed and was sold last year. The performance of the other speciality retailers also fell short of expectations, but in January Kmart said it had no intention of selling them. Instead it came up with a plan to create a new class of shares in the companies and sell 20-30 per cent of them. It was this plan that proved the last straw for some shareholders. After watching their company plunge to net losses of Dollars 947m last year, they wanted Kmart to get out of speciality retailing altogether and concentrate on putting its discount stores to rights. One after the other, the big pension funds - among them, the College Retirement Equities Fund and the California Public Employees Retirement System - weighed in with announcements that they would vote against the scheme. On Friday, Kmart's management lost the vote. So what happens now? Yesterday Kmart seemed dazed by the defeat, putting out a vague statement that spoke of 'reviewing all alternatives and taking actions that are in the best interests of Kmart shareholders'. The failure of its plan to sell stakes in the speciality retailers will leave it short of Dollars 500m to Dollars 1bn, a sum badly needed for its store refurbishment programme. Options could include selling the 21 per cent stake in Coles Myer, the Australian retailer; a cut in the dividend; or another attempt at a partial spin-off of the speciality subsidiaries. Alternatively, Kmart could do what the shareholders want and sell the subsidiaries altogether. That would not be Mr Antonini's preferred option: but if it is a choice between losing the subsidiaries or his job, he may yet come round to it.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Inger Viklund-Persson report: "Agreement on NATO </F> Invitation"]    [Text] At yesterday's meeting of the Foreign Affairs  Council, Prime Minister Carl Bildt reiterated Sweden's positive  attitude toward participation in the NATO cooperation program,  Partnership for Peace.    "The Defense Ministry and the Foreign Ministry will now look  at the details of the NATO initiative and see how we should  proceed. We will also discuss this with other countries, chiefly  with Finland, which has more or less the same attitude as we  do," the prime minister said after the meeting.    Prime Minister Bildt also stressed that Sweden is almost  best  in the world at peacekeeping operations and could contribute its  special competence.    "We can offer other countries training at the UN school at  Almnas outside Sodertalje."    Social Democratic leader Ingvar Carlsson was generally  positive. He said that the meeting had chiefly had the  character of a briefing.    In the past, the Social Democratic leader has called for  consultations among party leaders on Swedish security policy.  The prime minister's response has been that the question would  be discussed at the meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council after  the Christmas and New Year holidays. The meeting yesterday did  not touch on the question at all, however.</p>

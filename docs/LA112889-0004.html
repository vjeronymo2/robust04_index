James Thom, a truck driver from  St. Charles, Ill., said the bus was "blazing furiously" soon after it was  struck by Larry Mahoney's pickup. Thom, testifying during the third day of  Mahoney's trial in Carrollton, said he snatched some of the children from the  burning bus amid "a constant barrage of screams." Mahoney, 36, is charged with  27 counts of murder in the case. He also is charged with 12 counts of  first-degree assault, 42 counts of wanton endangerment and one count of drunk  driving.  </P></p>

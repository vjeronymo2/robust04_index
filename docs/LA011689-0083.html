			<p><P> January 16, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> Q&amp;A: MICHAEL L. MEYER;  </P> <P> FORDING THE AFFORDABLE STREAM;  </P> <P> REAL ESTATE EXPERT SEES WAYS TO BUILD LOWER-COST HOMES  </P> <P> It's a long way from Omaha to Laguna Beach, where he has made his home for 14  years on the waterfront, but like many of his contemporaries, Michael L. Meyer  fled the harsh climate of his birthplace for temperate Southern California in  the early 1960s and found Orange County to be the perfect place to enjoy the  sun and sea.  </P> <P> Meyer, a certified public accountant with a degree from the University of Iowa,  opened the Newport Beach office of Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co. in 1974. He has  headed the accounting and consulting firm's county operation ever since,  guiding its growth from a dozen to 155 employees and developing it into a  respected specialist in real estate and financial industry services.  </P> <P> In his role as a real estate and finance specialist in the county, Meyer has  for several years lobbied within the industry for a greater commitment to  lower-cost housing, citing both the potential financial rewards and the need  for a mix of housing prices to help keep the region's economy healthy.  </P> <P> Meyer, 50, writes a regular column for Southern California Builder, a regional  journal for the construction trades and has also written for the National Real  Estate Investor and California Builder. He has spoken on regional housing  issues at many meetings and seminars, including the USC Real Estate Conference  and the Pacific Coast Builders Conference.  </P> <P> In a recent interview with Times staff writer John O'Dell, Meyer discussed  lower-cost housing in the county and the programs being considered in  Washington to assist first-time home buyers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Q. Why are you concerned about lower-cost housing?  </P> <P> A. Well, our concern comes in working with the home builders and land  developers and commercial and industrial developers in the county. And their  concern is to be able to provide a product that is affordable to the people who  are their customers and to try to create a balance of housing and jobs. Among  other things, the more of a balance you can create, the fewer the social and  transportation problems that are created.  </P> <P> Q. We've all watched -- some with horror and some with glee -- the price of  housing in the county increase dramatically in the last few years. The latest  median price figures have homes in the county running from $230,000 for resale  single-family homes to $293,500 for new detached homes, and just 16% of the  families that live here can qualify to buy the median-priced resale home. Does  all this mean that affordable housing is a pipe dream?  </P> <P> A. Well, of course, it depends what you define as affordable. I think we're  reaching a point where the single-family detached home with a nice-size yard, a  living room, den, a couple of fireplaces and three bedrooms and three bathrooms  is not affordable to the median-income family. But you have to keep in mind  that these affordability indexes have a tendency to exaggerate the problem.  First of all, you're talking about median income, so half the homes are priced  lower than that. And when the statistics are about single-family detached, then  that's really only about a third of the housing stock that's available. And the  Realtors who report sales from Orange County almost all are from the southern  and coastal areas -- the higher-priced areas.  </P> <P> Q. In all the talk about affordable housing, is there any generally agreed-upon  figure, for income or for price, as to what is meant by "affordable?"  </P> <P> A. Well, there is no generally agreed figure, but the (county's) median  household income is something like $45,000 a year. So you could back down from  that and, presuming the median family has no other sources of income and no  significant savings, an affordable home would be in the range of $130,000 to  $150,000.  </P> <P> Q. If we use a $150,000 selling price as a cutoff, is there such a thing as  affordable housing in the county today?  </P> <P> A. If we use that kind of a guideline, then there's not very much affordable  housing. And the affordable housing that you do find will be attached --  townhouses or condominiums and rental units.  </P> <P> Q. If rentals should be included in discussions of affordable housing, then  aren't we facing new problems there? Hasn't there been a rather substantial  change in tax law -- a change that many say is going to kill off the rental  construction business?  </P> <P> A. Yes. Starting with the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the federal government has  deterred some investment in rental housing across the country because the  benefits of depreciation write-offs have been diminished and the losses from  rental operations aren't fully deductible anymore. Also, the tax act greatly  diminished a tax-exempt bond program, where developers of apartments could get  lower interest rates and pass them on as lower rents. So, around the country,  that has created a slowdown in apartment construction. But Orange County was  one of two markets in the country that had an increase in apartment  construction in 1987, although construction dropped in 1988 because of higher  land costs.  </P> <P> Q. If financial incentives for building rental units were reduced in '86, why  did rental construction stay relatively healthy here?  </P> <P> A. Well, the activity comes largely from local developers who have seen the  demand for rental units rise as the price of housing has escalated. The spread  between the cost of renting and the cost of homeownership has widened, and the  general feeling has been that even though there's not a very good immediate  return to an owner of an apartment building, the rents will steadily increase  in the future.  </P> <P> Q. And keep on spiraling until we end up with unaffordable apartments as well?  </P> <P> A. Well, yeah. There will be a tendency toward the more affordable apartments  being the older apartments.  </P> <P> Q. You said your interest is in representing builders and developers who are  concerned about having a salable product. Commercial and industrial developers  are not building housing, so what is their concern? Is it the availability of a  labor force that can afford to live here?  </P> <P> A. That's one of the concerns. It's a big problem. Both the immediate  availability of the lower-income type workers and the costs of relocating  higher-income workers to the county -- where housing prices are higher than  they were paying -- are major concerns.  </P> <P> Q. And where does that lead us?  </P> <P> A. As with the cost of land for housing, the cost of land for industrial and  commercial uses has moved up. So we won't have very many more warehouses or  factories built in Orange County. Instead, what we'll have are research and  development companies, a lot of medical research facilities and more upgraded  office buildings -- the types of uses that call upon the pool of higher-income  people more than the lower-income people. So it does have a tendency to balance  itself out that way.  </P> <P> Q. You have called repeatedly for Congress to take actions to spur construction  of lower-cost housing. What is going on in Washington on that front?  </P> <P> A. There is a Senate housing subcommittee that has been holding hearings on a  National Affordable Housing Act. That's been headed by (Sens.) Alan Cranston  (D-Calif.) and Alfonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.). One of the biggest problems across  the country is that lower-income people have trouble raising money for a down  payment. So one part of the proposal is to allow them to borrow from their IRA  accounts to get a down payment. Another (proposal) raises the Federal Housing  Administration limit for mortgage insurance, to allow people to get bigger  loans with lower down payments. The act would also provide funds for a program  for state and local governments to encourage private-public partnerships in  affordable housing construction and rehabilitation.  </P> <P> Q. Builders tend to be free-market advocates, so turning to government to  provide lower-cost housing hasn't been met with much enthusiasm. What is the  difference between programs in the past and what's being talked about now?  </P> <P> A. Well, I think there are certain things the government does have a proper  role in. Few people would argue that providing the basic infrastructure -- the  interstate highway system -- was not an appropriate role for the federal  government. Government also should be involved in developing schools and  providing clean water and sewage facilities and just keeping America's  infrastructure developed and maintained. Other areas, like tax-exempt bonds, or  even taxable bonds issued by governmental agencies, are a means of providing  lower-interest-rate financing, and of limiting the mortgages that are provided  to the lower-income families. So that is a good role for government in the  housing market.  </P> <P> Q. In other words, providing or finding ways of obtaining lower-cost financing  is appropriate for government, but not actually building and regulating who can  rent and sell and buy?  </P> <P> A. Yes. When the government gets involved in the details of either building or  controlling the building, then everything goes afoul. But some sort of a  partnership of local governments, developers, employers, and the general  populace, with leadership and incentives from the federal government -- that  makes sense. And in Orange County, the major employers hopefully will start to  take more interest in the issue of providing housing their workers can afford.  </P> <P> Q. Does that mean nothing is happening along that line now?  </P> <P> A. Right. But it is being talked about more. The large employers in the county  are taking more interest in all of the problems of the county, which includes  the transportation problems and the housing and social-welfare issues. And you  know there is a tremendous amount that a coalition of employers together with  developers and environmental agencies and other interest groups could do if  they put their minds to it. The 1986 tax act brought in tax credits against  your federal income tax if you invest in affordable housing. And that program  makes a lot of sense, but it was very slow to be accepted because of the  complex rules for claiming the credits. But now, some of the large investment  bankers are syndicating the credits to enable individuals and corporations to  buy shares. Builders would get the proceeds and do joint ventures with the  syndications to build apartment projects that are affordable.  </P> <P> Q. Do we have any of that development going on in Orange County?  </P> <P> A. It's not very prevalent. But we've been talking with a lot of our clients  about going into that program. The clients we've talked to are corporations.  None have moved into the program, but some are looking into the opportunities  to combine funding from the tax credit program, with assistance from local  redevelopment agencies. It is just not profitable in Orange County to build  moderate-income apartments without assistance. I can't identify any of the  clients we've talked to because of our confidentiality agreements, but what is  being explored is acquiring less desireable land at reasonable prices in  redevelopment areas and then building apartment units that could be rented by  moderate-income families. They are looking to the redevelopment agencies to  either write down the cost of the land or to assist by putting in streets and  other site developments. That, with the added funds from the tax-credit  syndications, would make these projects viable.  </P> <P> Q. Anything else that you see on the horizon to spur construction of lower-cost  housing?  </P> <P> A. I think we will see more taxable bond issues by municipalities. And we may  see some nonprofit organizations being put together in the county to issue  bonds to finance housing on a limited scale. State law also requires 20% of the  tax-increment funds captured by redevelopment agencies to be used for  affordable housing. But other than that, the help we're seeing from local  government is more indirect. Transportation improvements like the widening of  the 55 (Costa Mesa) Freeway. And transportation corridors. The San Joaquin  Hills Transportation Corridor is one that will be funded largely by builder  fees, with tolls and federal and state funds helping out. All of that just  starts to take a burden off of the home buyer, and helps out in providing these  necessary services. The other thing is that those roads are making areas more  accessible, and that provides people an opportunity to live in a more  affordable house and still be able to get to work. So all of the improvements  that go into making this a county where people can move around and be educated  and have a good life style and are paid for by somebody other than the  homeowner helps the home builder make a more affordable house.  </P> <P> Q. Much of the available raw land in the county is held in relatively few  hands. Does that have anything to do with costs? Do landowners now phase land  sales over time to keep prices up?  </P> <P> A. Well, I think that having the large land developers in the county has  resulted in beautiful, planned communities with all kinds of nice amenities.  And that planning process has developed communities that are so much above the  standard communities in America that it has driven the prices up in those  communities. But the landowners and developers are not holding land off the  market to try to drive the price up. Believe me, they try as hard as they can  to get the land approved and processed and developed. And they, above everyone  else, would prefer to see the problems of having an inadequate supply of  housing solved. They're concerned about the balance of the cost of housing --  versus what's affordable to the workers -- just as much as the community is  concerned about it.  </P> <P> Still, it is true that a big part of the reason the cost of building a house  has gone up so much over the years is the cost of land. And the reason land has  gone up so much is because of the shrinkage of the supply of land. A lot of the  shrinkage is because of requirements for open space by governmental  authorities.  </P> <P> And the cost of getting government approval to build has stretched out over the  years, so a developer or a landowner has significant costs just to hold onto  his land and plan it out.  </P> <P> And then there is the cost of the public facilities. The costs of schools,  streets, sewers, parks all have been passed onto the developers, when the costs  previously were paid for by the general community through the property tax  system. All of that adds on to the costs of building and ends up increasing the  cost of a house.  </P> <P> Q. How much do government costs add to the price of a home?  </P> <P> A. A 1987 survey by the Building Industry Assn. showed that the average costs  in Orange County were $7,500. But it ran much higher in some areas. San Juan  Capistrano was highest, with government-required fees and land dedications  adding $21,000 to the cost of each new home.  </P> <P> Q. But builders just pass on the costs, and so far there has not seemed to be a  lack of buyers. So what is the builders' concern?  </P> <P> A. I don't think they're concerned about pricing themselves out of being a  viable community. But the proven formula of having a nice balance is a lot more  comfortable than projecting out what the development of the county will be if  every house is $500,000. The question is always just how many people are there  that can afford a $500,000 home.  </P> <P> Q. Where is that money coming from?  </P> <P> A. Nobody can do a sophisticated analysis. But people obviously have a lot of  built-in equity in their existing house and in other properties. And there are  second- and third-generation people here that have had savings over the years.  And the economy's been good, so jobs are paying fairly well. And people are  optimistic about their future ability to pay off their debt. So they come  through with the money to buy the houses.  </P> <P> But it's speculative to guess how much further that could go. I believe that  we'll be seeing a more urban type of development here.  </P> <P> Q. Multistory apartments and condos?  </P> <P> A. In most urban areas, like New York or San Francisco, and more and more so in  Los Angeles, the chosen life style for the up-and-coming young executives,  secretaries and newlyweds is to live in a rental house near the places where  they work and shop. Retired people and empty-nesters have the tendency to live  in that type of environment too. It's only when they start to raise a family,  after they've been working for some years and saved some money, that urban  people move out into the suburban areas to buy a house. And then, as they make  their way through life and can afford to move up into a more upscale house,  they do that. And I think we'll just see more of a trend toward Orange County  developing into that type of highly desirable urban area.  </P> <P> Q. How optimistic are you that we are really going to see more efforts to  provide more lower-cost housing in the county in the next decade than in the  past?  </P> <P> A. Well, the optimism is only that we'll continue to see higher-density  developments, smaller houses, smaller rental units, or higher-density projects  in terms of high-rise or mid-rise construction. We'll also see redevelopment of  the older mixed-use downtown areas. Orange County is getting older, and now  that we have some of these 20-, 30- and 40-year-old sites, we'll see some of  them redeveloped as urban villages, with retail and commercial and decent and  more affordable housing.  </P> <P> Q. We've also got a lot of 20- and 30-year-old residential tracts in the  central and northern cities. Is there talk of redevelopment in those areas?  </P> <P> A. Individual houses are remodeled and upgraded over a period of time, some  with the help of government programs. But to think of a developer compiling 100  houses to tear down and redevelop into a new housing tract, that's just too  prohibitive. But there will be rezoning of single-family property to  multifamily. And developers will buy six or eight houses and build a  three-story apartment on the property. That type of ongoing upgrading of an  older neighborhood to what's now considered a better use will continue to  happen.  </P></p>

			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / The Economy: Deutsche Bank seeks to join Chaps system DEUTSCHE BANK, the biggest bank in Germany, has applied to become a UK clearing bank by joing Chaps, the electronic system for clearing and settling high value bank payments. If Deutsche is successful - bankers said yesterday it was likely to be  - it would become the first Continental bank to have a clearing account at the Bank of England. Banks' debts and credits to each other, resulting from Chaps transactions, are cleared at the end of each working day at the Bank of England. It also emerged yesterday that six other Continental banks, including Credit Lyonnais, France's biggest bank, have made approaches to Chaps with a view to becoming clearers in London. A banker said two or three of these would probably become members. Foreign banks have traditionally done their sterling clearing by using UK banks, such as Barclays or National Westminster, as their agents. They have had the right to join Chaps for several years but only Citibank of the US has exercised it. Deutsche Bank's move appears to represent a vote of confidence in the future of London as a financial centre. Bankers said this was encouraging, given that doubts had been expressed about the City of London's ability to remain the leading European financial centre following sterling's withdrawal last year from the exchange rate mechanism and the government's lukewarm attitude to monetary union. Deutsche's approval is likely in the next two months.</p>

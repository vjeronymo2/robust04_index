			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Observer: Undercurrent Two different worlds. A fortnight ago, water industry regulator Ian Byatt was unveiling new and highly market-sensitive price controls for the water companies. Today Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, will perform the same task for electricity companies in England and Wales. In both cases, the companies were advised of the results 24 hours before they were released to the market. In the case of water, not a single detail seeped out, and Byatt was able to reveal all to a waiting world. No such luck for Littlechild; the stock market has been certain for days what he is up to. By yesterday, dealing rooms were abuzz with the details, and excerpts from the report were even doing the rounds. Maybe it's just that electricity executives are bigger gossips than their water colleagues. But another difference is that Byatt held a special briefing session for stock analysts. Littlechild declined to do so - which did not please the scribblers . . .</p>

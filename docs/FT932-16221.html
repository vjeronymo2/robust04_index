			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Rail talks expected in attempt to avert strike TALKS BETWEEN British Rail and the RMT transport union are expected to try to avert the second 24-hour rail strike planned for Friday April 16. The RMT's executive yesterday decided to allow a breathing space before the next stoppage is due to take place so that a 'negotiated settlement' might be reached with BR. Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general secretary, said yesterday: 'The opportunity is there if BR want to take it.' He stressed that his union's dispute is with the British Railways board and not the travelling public. 'As a responsible trade union we respect the fact that many thousands of families and individuals will be setting off to enjoy a break this (Easter) weekend. We do not intend to disrupt that holiday,' he said. Mr Knapp added that the RMT was 'willing to resume negotiations to find a resolution of the dispute'. The union is asking BR for a guarantee that it will not seek compulsory redundancies among its members and for a ban on the employment of contractors on the railway network. Mr Paul Watkinson, BR group personnel director, expressed dismay at the decision to hold a second 24-hour strike and said he would be in touch with the union to see 'once again whether there is scope to resolve the situation through serious talking with a will to reach a solution'.</p>

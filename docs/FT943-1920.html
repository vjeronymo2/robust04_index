			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Nato extends Bosnia air cover Nato ambassadors yesterday decided to extend air cover by alliance aircraft beyond Bosnia to a small part of Croatia near the Bihac enclave. This means that in principle alliance aircraft could carry out bombing raids against Serb positions in Croatia if the Serbs were attacking UN forces around the Bihac enclave in Bosnia. The alliance ambassadors agreed that air cover could be extended to the whole of Croatia, but that would require a more complex operation involving the UN authorities in Zagreb. Yesterday's decision falls short of the imposition of a draconian 'exclusion zone' - where all heavy weapons are subject to air strikes. Any move in that direction would require a fresh UN resolution. However, diplomats said that even limited Nato air raids on Serb positions in Croatia could mark an important twist in the conflict. Yesterday's meeting in Brussels was the latest in a series of moves towards a tougher Bosnian policy that has been taken at alliance headquarters, where frustration is growing over the cautious tactics of UN commanders on the ground. The meeting took place amid pressure from US officials for a toughening of the application of existing policies in Bosnia, including the commitment to maintain six enclaves or 'safe areas' for the government side.</p>

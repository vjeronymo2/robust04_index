			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Court win for Hindu party A COURT in Madhya Pradesh, India's largest state, has ruled that the dismissal of the Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party government in the state in December was 'invalid' and 'beyond the scope' of the constitution. The judgment by the state's High Court is a major victory for the BJP, India's largest opposition party, which demanded reinstatement of all four of its dismissed state assemblies or fresh state elections. The Madhya Pradesh government, along with three other BJP governments in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh, were dismissed by India's ruling Congress (I) party following the destruction of the Ayodhya mosque, which sparked widespread communal violence. Mr Sunder Lal Patwa, Madhya Pradesh chief minister, had challenged the proclamation dismissing his government, calling it a 'political vendetta and a gross misuse of powers' against the opposition party. The court noted that the government had been unable to support its case for imposing central rule only in the BJP-ruled states, while other state governments survived despite their inability to contain post-Ayodhya violence. The judges said dismissal of the BJP government in Madhya Pradesh was 'wholly uncalled for'. They said the BJP government in Himachal Pradesh had also been dismissed even though there had been no disturbances in the state of the kind that occurred in Madhya Pradesh. Congress I leaders voiced concern the judgment could lead to early elections in the states. They said they would appeal to the Supreme Court.</p>

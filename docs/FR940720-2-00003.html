Box 2255, Waldron, AR 72958. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> responsible official:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The Forest Supervisor for the Quachita National Forest, located at P.O. Box 1270, Hot Springs, AR 71902, is the Responsible Official and the deciding official for this action. If this becomes a significant amendment to the Forest Plan, the Regional Forester in Atlanta, Georgia will be the Responsible Official and the deciding official for this action. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <ACTION> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> proposed action:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The goal of this proposal is to renew the historic shortleaf pine/bluestem grass ecosystem on a portion of the Ouachita National Forest. Renewal includes recovery of the Red-cockaded Woodpecker (RCW). This EIS will document the analysis of alternatives to the proposed action and disclose the effects of designating a Shortleaf Pine/Bluestem Grass Ecosystem Management Area and implementing the Regional EIS for  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> Management of the RCW and its Habitat on National Forests in the South.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Recovery of the RCW includes changing the current Forest Plan goal of 50 breeding groups to a minimum of 250 breeding groups on the Forest. Designation of Management Area 22 affects the management direction for 155,010 acres of National Forest. There will be no change in the amount of land classified as suitable for timber harvest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ecosystem management of the proposed area would include a broad variety of forest conditions and management practices. Resource outputs such as timber production would be a product of managing to restore the shortleaf pine/bluestem grass ecosystem. To feature older stands, regeneration cycles will be lengthened to a minimum of 120 years. Regeneration areas would retain indefinitely a portion of the overstory trees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Management Area 22 would occur in portions of the Ouachita National Forest in Scott and Polk counties, Arkansas. Included within this management area would be the proposed Habitat Management Area (HMA) for the RCW, containing 84,312 acres of which 66,606 acres is suitable for timber management. A new desired future condition, management area goals and standards and guidelines would be formulated for this new Management Area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> Preliminary Issues <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Through our informational meetings and meetings with other citizens, the following issues relating to the effects of the proposal have been identified. These are preliminary  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> issues. Additional scoping and public participation will be used to refine and add to this list to develop a complete understanding of the significant issues related to this proposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. People are concerned that this proposal will result in a reduction in the local supply of timber products from the National Forest. This could have a direct and indirect effect on local communities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. People are concerned that hardwood trees would be eliminated in the proposed Management Area. Hardwood tree retention and forest diversity in pine-dominated areas of the Forest has been an issue that has been addressed many times in the past. This proposal stresses that current hardwood tree retention guidelines will not be changed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. There are concerns that smoke from an increased prescribed burning program could lower air quality and visibility. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. There is a concern that this proposal will increase costs to taxpayers. Costs, both direct and indirect, would have to be estimated. Timber receipts from projects in the proposed area will help pay expenses through the Knutson-Vandenberg Act of 1930. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. There is a concern that if the population of Red-cockaded Woodpeckers (RCW) on the Forest increases, the RCW's will move to adjoining private lands. Since they are a federally listed endangered species, this could lead to limitations on the management of that private land under Section 9 of the Endangered Species Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. There is a concern that portions of the Forest might be closed to uses such as hunting, fishing, berry picking or firewood gathering in the future. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. There is a concern that evenaged timber management techniques will be the only harvest techniques used in this area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Preliminary Alternatives:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Forest Service will evaluate a wide range of alternatives to the proposal in response to the issues identified in the scoping process. The agency expects to consider at least the following alternatives, which respond to preliminary issues identified to date. As new issues are identified through public participation, new alternatives may be created, and existing alternatives modified. Some of these preliminary alternatives may not be analyzed in detail. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Alternative A (No Action)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This alternative would not change the management area allocations, activities or desired future condition of the existing Forest Plan. The rotation age for shortleaf pine would remain at 70 years. The current goal of 50 groups of RCW would remain. There would be no change in fire control or prescribed fire activities. Revenues and expenditures would remain at or near current levels, as would the supply of timber products. Hardwood tree retention rates would not change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </ACTION> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Libya makes conciliatory move Libya has appointed an oil industry manager with good contacts in the US and Europe as foreign minister in the hope of ending its crisis with the west over the Lockerbie airliner bombing, Reuter reports. The General People's Congress named Omar Mustafa el-Montasser to replace Ibrahim Mohamed Beshari. Earlier, Libyan second-in-command Abdel-Salam Jalloud appealed to US President-elect Bill Clinton to open a 'new page' in relations and allow the lifting of United Nations sanctions against Libya. Western governments have been demanding for a year that Libya hand over for trial in the US or Britain two men suspected of blowing up Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie in Scotland in 1988.</p>

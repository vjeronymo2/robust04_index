Jim Brent said. The snake  was seized by animal control officers.  </P> <P> Deputies found a Dragon anti-tank rocket launcher but no rockets. Among the  other items found were a replica of an M-60 machine gun and 20 small explosive  devices, deputies said.  </P> <P> Chris Sundahl and Edward Coleman, both 40 and of Lancaster, were arrested on  suspicion of possession of explosive devices and were being held in lieu of  $70,000 bail each at the sheriff's Antelope Valley station.  </P></p>

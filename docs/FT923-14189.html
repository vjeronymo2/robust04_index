			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / UK Company News: SB to dispose of its personal care products SMITHKLINE Beecham, the Anglo-American pharmaceuticals and consumer products group, is looking to dispose of its low-margin personal care products. The company said yesterday it wanted to focus on health products, like pharmaceuticals, over-the-counter non-prescription medicines and health-related drinks such as Horlicks, Ribena and Lucozade. Ideally it would like to swap the personal care brands for OTC pharmaceutical brands. However, it would be willing to pay cash at the same time, as the pharmaceuticals business was highly cash generative and successful OTC brands were difficult to create. The company refused to say which of its brands were available for sale. Its personal care products include Brylcreem, Vosene and Badedas. However, it treats oral hygiene products and feminine brands as OTC products. SB said it was already in negotiations with a number of companies but refused to identify them. The move would be part of a wider reorganisation of the consumer brands business, it said. The personal care products businesses made sales last year of about Pounds 300m; the OTC operations generated revenues of Pounds 700m in the same period. 'There are plenty of sensible reasons for strengthening the OTC side,' said Mr Mark Brewer, pharmaceuticals analyst at Credit Lyonnais Laing. 'The problem is it's difficult to imagine anyone wanting to swap their OTC products for personal care brands.' Most pharmaceutical groups are building up their OTC businesses. One reason, explains Mr Brewer, is to compensate for lost sales of ethical prescription products when they lose their patents. SB is looking to gain a licence in the US to sell Tagamet, its best-selling ethical medicine, over the counter. The drug, used to treat ulcers, comes off-patent in the US in 1994. OTC brands based on former prescription products can command higher prices.</p>

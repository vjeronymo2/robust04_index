			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHILD'SPLAY: AROUND HOME;  </P> <P> TUMBLING TYKES  </P> <P> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA'S many gymnastics schools reflect a variety of philosophies  about the sport. Some emphasize its fitness benefits; others offer the  opportunity to participate in team competition. Although few children learn  gymnastics to become the next Mary Lou Retton, parents may wish to ask the  director of the center they select to explain the center's approach.  </P> <P> Because children of the same age vary widely in their fitness level, parents  should look for gyms that evaluate and place kids with children of similar  experience. Beginners, obviously, should not be placed with veterans. But even  novices should be given a chance to learn about all the major pieces of  gymnastics apparatus.  </P> <P> Centers that approach gymnastics as a means of building both fitness and  self-esteem provide a gentle introduction to the sport. Among centers with this  approach are the Fun &amp; Fit Gymnastics Centers of Burbank and Canyon  Country. "In competitive gymnastics, there are always more losers than  winners," says Jeff Lulla, president of Fun &amp; Fit. "We find ways of  offering praise even if a task is not perfectly performed."  </P> <P> Centers that encourage their most accomplished students to go into competition  also offer a full range of recreational classes for children who do not wish to  compete and do not pressure students to enter competition. Gymnastics Olympica  in Van Nuys maintains competitive teams for boys and girls. A child-scaled  training room is available through its Sportskids weight-training program for  all kinds of young athletes. Other centers offering competitive opportunities  include SCATS, a nonprofit organization with four centers; Foothill Academy of  Gymnastics, Pasadena, and USA (United Sports Assn.), Santee.  </P> <P> Gymnastics for children is taught at Fun &amp; Fit Gymnastics Centers in  Burbank, (818) 845-0700, or in Canyon Country, (805) 255-7244; Imagymnation in  Simi Valley, (805) 584-8872; Junior Gym in West Los Angeles, (213) 479-2730;  Gymnastics Olympica in Van Nuys, (818) 785-1537; SCATS of Huntington Beach,  Anaheim, Mission Viejo and Walnut, (714) 890-7014; Foothill Academy of  Gymnastics in Pasadena, (818) 446-6789, and USA (United Sports Assn.) in  Santee, (619) 449-9459.  </P> <P> </P></p>

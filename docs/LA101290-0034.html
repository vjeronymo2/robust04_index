			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> NORTH STARS RALLY TO TIE BRUINS  </P> <P> Mike Modano scored the tying goal on a rink-length rush with 9:42 left in the  third period Thursday night at Bloomington, Minn., and the Minnesota North  Stars rallied for a 3-3 tie with the Boston Bruins, ending the Bruins'  season-opening four-game winning streak.  </P> <P> Modano, the top pick in the 1988 draft, also had two assists as the North Stars  overcame a 3-0 deficit early in the second period.  </P> <P> The Bruins were the only unbeaten, untied team in the NHL.  </P> <P> Chicago 4, Pittsburgh 1 -- Jeremy Roenick had the first hat trick in the NHL  this season as the Blackhawks beat the Penguins at Chicago.  </P> <P> Roenick scored twice in a 1:55 span in the first period and then knocked in the  rebound off Steve Larmer's 25-foot shot with less than six minutes left.  </P> <P> Philadelphia 7, New Jersey 4 -- Jiri Latal scored twice in the Flyers'  three-goal first period at Philadelphia, but the victory could prove costly as  goaltender Ron Hextall left the game with a pulled back muscle.  </P> <P> Hextall, who missed most of last season with injuries, left with 3:06 remaining  in the second period.  </P></p>

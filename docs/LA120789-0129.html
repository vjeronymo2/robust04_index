			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOSES AND THE MASSES TURN OUT FOR MUSIC CENTER BIRTHDAY BASH  </P> <P> Ask a Hollywood cabbie how to get to the Music Center and he might say,  "Practice!"  </P> <P> Ask the kids from Chinatown's Castelar Elementary School and you won't get a  punch line. "We walked up Alpine and turned left on Grand," one sixth-grader  explained Wednesday, providing a partial explanation as to why an estimated  10,000 people found themselves on Music Center Plaza at lunchtime Wednesday.  </P> <P> The occasion was the Music Center's 25th birthday. In a silver anniversary year  that has been sprinkled with exclusive black-tie soirees, this event was a  decidedly Populist affair that featured, among other things, Charlton Heston  doing a little Moses shtick.  </P> <P> In addition to 70 kids from Castelar, the crowd included more than 1,200  uniformed high school musicians, an army of office workers on their lunch  break, scores of jurors from the courthouse next door and at least two theater  lovers who rode in on an RTD bus.  </P> <P> "What I was trying to do was compare the number of people to the kids in band,  and 10,000 is probably conservative," said Music Center spokeswoman Kathy  Bornstein.  </P> <P> The party was a way for the Music Center to show its appreciation for years of  support from the Los Angeles community, Bornstein said. "We do a lot of big  events and galas during the year. We're really more and more geared to doing  events for the community at large.  </P> <P> This party featured carrot cake, cartons of milk, jugglers and the USC Song  Girls. Radio personalities Ken Minyard and Bob Arthur served as emcees, and, as  at any good Southern California party, the talk turned to real estate. When the  Music Center opened on Dec. 6, 1964, they noted, the average cost of a  three-bedroom home in Los Angeles was $15,425.  </P> <P> The massive musical ensemble was composed of the USC marching band and 22 high  school bands that had arrived from as far away as Mojave, Riverside and San  Diego. They played selections from "A Chorus Line," "The Phantom of the Opera"  and "The Music Man."  </P> <P> Heston, featured as a guest speaker along with Carol Channing, recalled that  when the Music Center was being planned more than 25 years ago, "some people  thought it might dampen the performing arts here. Of course, that has not  happened."  </P> <P> Adding some Hollywood schmaltz to the occasion, Heston briefly reprised his  role in the film "The Ten Commandments," with the Lipchitz Fountain playing the  role of the Red Sea. Holding Moses' (prop) staff aloft, Heston intoned, "Who is  on the Lord's side? Let him come to me!"  </P> <P> The waters parted, of course. Just like at Universal Studios.  </P> <P> For revelers who didn't have jobs to get back to or verdicts to decide, the  Music Center opened the Mark Taper Forum to the public Wednesday afternoon for  a free dress rehearsal of Truman Capote's "A Christmas Memory."  </P></p>

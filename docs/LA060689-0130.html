			<p><P> June 6, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> OPERA REVIEW;  </P> <P> BATES MOUNTS A DECENT SHOWCASE FOR THE MODEST CHARMS OF 'DIDO AND AENEAS'  </P> <P> For less obvious reasons, early-music performance in San Diego County is about  as popular as ice fishing. Though a modest circle of aficionados presents  occasional chamber concerts, opportunities to hear large works by composers who  flourished before the time of J. S. Bach are rare.  </P> <P> Seen in this light, conductor David Bates' mounting of a concert version of  Henry Purcell's opera "Dido and Aeneas" at La Jolla United Methodist Church on  Sunday night was both a brave and a commendable venture.  </P> <P> Tipping his hat to authenticity, he imported the Los Angeles Baroque Orchestra  to accompany a cadre of local soloists. Bowing to more pragmatic requirements,  he employed the church's 40-voice Sanctuary Choir to sing the opera's chorus  parts.  </P> <P> Because "Dido and Aeneas" was originally presented in a London girls' boarding  school, rather than in a sumptuous court opera house, a church performance is  not as unlikely as it may appear.  </P> <P> All things considered, the performance proved to be a reasonable exposition of  the 300-year-old opera's charms, modest as they are. Martha Jane Weaver sang a  dignified Dido, her dusky mezzo-soprano seemingly tailor-made for a role of  such stoic despairing. She projected her phrases in long, graceful arches, and  her final aria communicated admirable pathos.  </P> <P> As Belinda, Dido's lady-in-waiting, soprano Mary-Esther Nicola-Peck added an  animated and tastefully ornamented foil to Weaver's gravity.  </P> <P> Other notable vocal contributions included baritone John Polhamus' suitably  stolid Aeneas and a spritely witches' duet filled with well-turned roulades  sung by soprano Martha Hamilton and countertenor Michael Cox. Elizabeth  Kimery's Sorceress, however, vacillated between melodramatic wobbles and less  than Baroque shrieks.  </P> <P> Stage director Thomas Richardson provided minimal movement for the principals.  While this allowed the singers to move on and off stage according to the needs  of the libretto, some of his gestures and poses appeared unintentionally  comedic. As Weaver slowly extended her arm in the solemn aria that begins, "Thy  hand, Belinda," Nicola-Peck scampered to her side like Mozart's infatuated  Cherubino bounding over to kiss the countess' hand.  </P> <P> Though the well-trained choir displayed a pleasant tone and clean diction, it  lacked a sense of 17th-Century style, especially in terms of phrasing and  metrical accent. On the podium, Bates could have done with less body language  and more focused conducting, but he kept his forces together and moving ahead  at a brisk pace.  </P> <P> Under the leadership of concertmaster Gregory Maldonado, the 11  instrumentalists of the Los Angeles Baroque Orchestra opened the program with  an instrumental suite from Purcell's "King Arthur." This period instrument  ensemble lacked no sympathy for the composer's angular, short-phrased style,  although the group's uneven releases marred the clean ensemble.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Manila, April 21 (XINHUA) -- China has earned  world-wide appreciation for helping prevent the crisis in the  Korean peninsula from further deteriorating, Senator Blas F.  Ople said here today.    Ople, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,  said that as he welcomed the Foreign Affairs Committee  delegation of the National People's Congress of China at the  Ninoy Aquino International Airport.    He said to a great extent it was due to China's efforts that  the threat level to peace between the two Koreas has apparently  now subsided.    The senator, who just returned from Marrakesh, Morroco,  where  97 nations signed the final act of the Uruguay Round of talks on  the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), said various  delegations assembled in Marrakesh favored the early admission  of China to GATT to be an original member of the new World Trade  Organization (WTO), expected to succeed GATT by January 1995.    The WTO, to be credible, needs to be universal, and that  standard cannot be attained without the admission of China, Ople  said.    Zhu Liang, head of the Chinese parliamentary delegation,  said  Philippine-Chinese relations were a stabilizing influence in the  East Asia region.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jan Carnogursky, chairman of the Christian </F> Democratic Movement, KDH, by Alena Melicharkova; place and date  not given: "Everyone Is Condemned To Pursue Right-Wing Policies"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Melicharkova] The left has  been victorious in several postcommunist countries, including  Poland and Hungary. Some political scientists expect a similar  development also in our country. They even say that, in a  certain way, those election results demonstrate distrust of  changes and the market system. What if the left actually wins  in Slovakia?    [Carnogursky] As a democrat I respect, and will respect, the  legitimate results of democratic elections. Should the voters  really vote more in favor of the left, let them have a left-wing  government. The Christian Democratic Movement [KDH] would still  stick to its right-wing positions, to the socially oriented  market economy. But let us look at some factors from the past.  Before the last elections, the Movement for a Democratic  Slovakia [HZDS] was promising an economic policy geared toward  development that would be completely different from the  federally applied reform. Three months after the elections,  when the late Professor Koctuch returned from the United States,  from talks with the IMF, the HZDS immediately changed its entire  economic concept and acknowledged that right-wing economic  policy was the only option. That is why, deep within, I chuckle  when you ask me what will happen if left-wing parties win. Even  if this happened, it would be only a question of time before  they realized that they must pursue right-wing policies. After  all, even [Party of the Democratic Left Chairman] Peter Weiss  said in a newspaper interview about a year ago that the economic  policy of the Party of the Democratic Left was to the right of  the HZDS's economic policy. And, mind you, that was after  Professor Koctuch's return from the United States.    [Melicharkova] Is the formation of a coalition government  composed in the same way as the present government possible  after the elections, in your opinion?    [Carnogursky] The present term of office is also a trial  period whether such a coalition can continue even after the  elections. It seems, for the time being, that it might.  [passage omitted]</p>

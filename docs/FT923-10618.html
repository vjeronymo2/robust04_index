			<p>920729 FT  29 JUL 92 / International Company News: EC set to tap syndicated loans market THE European Community is poised to tap the international syndicated loans market for the first time in nearly a decade with a three-year Ecu500m (Dollars 675m) facility. The proceeds will finance imports of agricultural and medical products by the republics which formerly made up the Soviet Union. The EC is expected to award the mandate to a European bank this week. Deutsche Bank and National Westminster Bank are among those which have bid for the position of lead manager, although Banque Nationale de Paris and Societe Generale have been mentioned as contenders. The EC traditionally prefers to borrow in the international bond markets - where it can fund at below the London interbank offered rate (Libor) - rather than the international syndicated loans market where pricing is much higher. An EC official stressed that in the case of funding exports to former Soviet republics, the EC had chosen a syndicated loan 'because it gives us flexibility to choose the date of drawing the funds. In this case we will need a lengthy draw-down period which would be difficult to arrange with a bond where we would have to take the funds and then be exposed to an interest rate risk.' The EC last tapped the international syndicated loans market in 1983 with a Dollars 1.24bn term loan.</p>

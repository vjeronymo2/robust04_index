			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / Arts: Faith Healer - Royal Court Theatre After the delights of his Dancing at Lughnasa, Brian Friel's new play turns out to be relatively heavy going. Indeed, were it not for his charming Irish way with the English language and the excellence of the acting, one would be tempted to say that it is overlong and dangerously thin. Faith Healer does not have much of a theme. It might be summed up as 'what is the difference between someone who occasionally achieves miraculous cures and a quack?' The answer is not a lot. A sub-theme, explored in the second act, is what is the difference between a faith healer and a music hall artist. The answer is much the same. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. No-one can say for certain why the act comes off one night, and not another. Being Irish, it might have something to do with the drink. Friel, however, is careful to state that neither the whiskey nor the lack of it give the full explanation. The mystery of why the same act can fall flat at times and be a brilliant success at others remains unsolved. There are sufficient references to Laurence Olivier in the text to suggest a direct debt to John Osborne's The Entertainer. It was Olivier who played the old fading comic in Osborne's play and told the audience not to applaud too much - 'it's an old building'. Teddy, the business manager in the faith-healing act, explicitly draws the parallels betwteen entertainment and cure, failure and success. It is all show business. One of the reasons why it is heavy going is that Friel has chosen to present the play as a series of monologues. There are only three characters; they never appear together. First, Frank Hardy, the faith healer, tells the story of travelling around the Celtic fringes of the United Kingdom practising his arts and wondering whether he has extraordinary gifts or is no more than a con man. Strikingly, he never goes to a metropolis. Most of his works take place in the upper reaches of Scotland or Glamorganshire. The majority of the people who come to him, he notes, are despairing. Then Grace, his wife, to whom Frank insists on referring to in public as his mistress, tells the story again in a slightly different light. The daughter of a Scottish judge, obviously she adores him. In the second act the story is told by Teddy, the man responsible for keeping the show on the road. At the end, Frank returns for a final monologue, Grace having died from an overdose of sleeping pills in Paddington. The fatal mistake, apparently, was to attempt to take faith-healing to Dublin: it doesn't work on home ground. In between times, there is a good deal of Fred Astaire singing The Way You Look Tonight. It was the great hit song in the year that Frank and Grace met. How much significance it has beyond that defies me, though the words might explain why the faith-healing sometimes works. It is all excellently done, as you would expect in a play by Friel and directed by Joe Dowling. Teddy, in particular, has a terrific scene at the beginning of the second act where he tells about his performing dogs. He is marvellously played by Ron Cook. Donal McCann as Frank is even better when he appears for his final soliloquy than he is at the start. Sinead Cusack has some pathos and dignity - perhaps not enough - as Grace. But when you come down to it, it is not much more than a lot of lovely Irish words. The Irish have a knack of getting away with it.</p>

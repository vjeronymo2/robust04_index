			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Pakistan urges release of Britons The Pakistan government and Pakistan-based militant groups yesterday called on the captors of two Britons in Indian-held Kashmir to release them unharmed. Indian troops launched an extensive search for the two, Mr Kim Housego, 16, and Mr David Mackie, 36, who were captured on Monday by gunmen. The Moslem militant group Harkat-ul-Ansar said it had kidnapped them to highlight human rights abuses by Indian troops in Kashmir. 'It is not true that we have abducted them to secure the release of our three leaders,' the group said in a statement delivered to the Reuters office in Srinagar, Kashmir's summer capital. The statement said they would not harm the Britons but warned India against using force to free them. A note demanding the release of three jailed guerrillas had been left with Mr David Housego, Kim's father and former Financial Times correspondent in New Delhi, who had been trekking south-east of Srinagar with his wife and son and Mr and Mrs Mackie. Pakistan condemned the kidnapping and appealed for the release of the captives, though it also said India must stop human rights abuses in Kashmir and release detained Kashmiri leaders. Mr Mohammed Farooq Kashmiri, a leader of the Harkat-ul-Ansar group in Muzaffarabad, Pakistan, said it had appealed to the captors to immediately release the hostages: 'We have no involvement or interest in this matter.' Mr Amanullah Khan, leader of the militant Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front, also called last night for the captives to be released.</p>

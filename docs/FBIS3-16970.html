			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [No dateline as received] -- A UNIAN correspondent  learned today that heating in Ukraine's residential buildings  and at enterprises will be switched off before the end of March  rather than on 15 April as was the case previously. Commenting  on the situation, Oleksiy Sheberstov, Ukraine's first deputy  minister of power engineering and electrification, said  Ukraine's fuel supplies are rapidly diminishing. At the same  time, consumers owe 8,000 billion karbovantsi to the ministry,  which is the reason why it lacks the money to buy oil and gas  for heating.</p>

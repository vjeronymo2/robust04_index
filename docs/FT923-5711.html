			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Survey of Malaysia (10): Helpful neighbours can also be a liability - Tourism is the only service industry to run a surplus, but there is anxiety at the central bank TO THE Malaysian tourism industry, Thailand is a source of both inspiration and despair: inspiration, because of its longstanding success in attracting foreign visitors; despair, because the political violence in Bangkok in May has prompted some holidaymakers to cancel their visits to south-east Asia. Malaysia is anxious to emulate Thailand's successful handling of the tourist trade, not least because the Kuala Lumpur government is concerned about the services deficit in the balance of payments, and tourism is the only service industry to run a surplus. By 1990 - or Visit Malaysia Year 1990, if you are in the tourism business - tourists had become the country's third largest source of foreign exchange, after manufacturing and crude oil, although arrivals have since fallen from that year's total of 7.5m visitors. In its latest annual report, the Malaysian central bank notes with some Angst that the country's tourism industry is lagging behind those of its neighbours in Asean (the Association of South East Asian Nations) in terms of the sector's share of gross national product. Furthermore, half of Malaysia's visitors are short-stay tourists from Singapore (day-trippers are not counted); the average length of stay in Malaysia is put at 4.6 nights, against 6.1 for Thailand. Average per diem spending is MDollars 345 in Thailand, compared with only MDollars 128 in Malaysia; Thailand has more than three times as many hotel rooms. With holidays in the developed world becoming longer and longer, tourists increasingly favour multi-destination holidays. Malaysia has used the opportunity to expand its business, particularly by forging links with Thailand and Singapore, the two main air travel gateways to south-east Asia (the slogan for the Malaysia-Singapore tie-up is: 'Fascinating Malaysia, surprising Singapore: two great countries, one great holiday'). The potential disadvantages of such links were graphically illustrated in May, when troops killed at least 50 pro-democracy demonstrators on the streets of Bangkok. Many holidays through the Bangkok gateway were cancelled, at least in the short term, and, in the words of Mr Ahmad Bakri Shabdin, the director general of the Malaysia Tourism Promotion Board, 'when they cancel, they cancel both legs of a journey'. That setback, and the competing lure of the recent Olympic Games in Barcelona, have left Malaysia struggling to reach its target of 6.6m visitors for 1992, although the start of the new high season is yet to come. The Gulf war helped push down 1991 arrivals to 5.9m from 1990's 7.5m, and Malaysia had been hoping for a brisk revival. 'Come 1992, we were hoping for a recovery, but we are now being affected very much by the global recession,' says Mr Bakri Shabdin. 'It has been compounded by the fact that in 1991 many countries developed domestic tourism.' In the European market, Malaysia finds itself competing with more convenient destinations in America or the Mediterranean; and even in Asia, the most important source of tourism, there are problems with the decline of the Japanese incentive travel market. Malaysia has much to offer the tourist, from tropical beach holidays, scuba diving and hill resorts in the peninsula to jungle treks and mountain walks in Borneo, but it has never been able to project a clear image to its potential customers. The jury is still out on the success of Visit Asean Year 1992 - an attempt to link the six Asean members (Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand) - but it appears that Asean is too little known outside the region to make much impact on the average tourist. Tourism officials point vaguely at Malaysia's ethnic diversity and interesting history, but admit that the name Malaysia conjures up different and hazy images for different people if it conjures up anything at all. 'Since 1990 we've decided to highlight our natural resources,' says Mr Bakri Shabdin. 'That's one thing we have that is uniquely Malaysian. We are acknowledged as being the home of the oldest rainforest in the world.' Leaving aside the controversy over whether that rainforest is being irreparably destroyed by logging, Malaysia also realised from its 1990 campaign that it was worth making an effort to promote the country vigorously as a tourist destination, and worth linking its promotions to special events already scheduled for Malaysia. 'We learned from 1990 that there is a very marked correlation between events and people arriving in the country,' says Mr Bakri Shabdin. 'We realise that tourism is very much a consumer-oriented activity, and therefore we have to continually make our presence felt in the global tourism market.' The result was a decision to launch another Visit Malaysia Year in 1994  - an idea first mooted as early as 1991 and formally inaugurated this year - and to repeat the process every four years. This will fit conveniently with the Commonwealth Games in Malaysia in 1998. Malaysia has already started to release promotional material for the 1994 campaign, featuring a jungle scene with flowers, butterflies and a waterfall. Tourists are curious, but it is questionable whether many foreign visitors will be drawn to Malaysia by some of the advertised events - including a squid-fishing festival, an Asean literature meeting, the Ipoh half-marathon, the birthday of the state governor of Malacca and a bird-singing competition - rather than by Malaysia's more permanent charms of sun, sea, sand and jungle. Perhaps the important ingredients for reviving the Malaysian tourism industry will not only be the kite shows and Malaysian fruit festivals, but also the continued investment in real estate (up to 70 hotels and resorts are planned before the end of the decade and the number of hotel rooms is increasing by 10 to 12 per cent a year), the proposed new airport, and a recovery in the world economy.</p>

Final  </P> <P> EARNINGS;  </P> <P> ALLIED-LYONS PROFITS UP 10%  </P> <P> Britain's Allied-Lyons PLC, a diversified food and drinks conglomerate, said  today its profit climbed 10% in the six months ended Sept. 15, helped by  special items and results of newly acquired Dunkin Donuts.  </P> <P> The maker of Beefeaters Gin said its pretax profit rose to $569 million from  $512 million as sales edged up to $4.98 billion from $4.8 billion.  </P> <P> The pretax figure included a substantial gain of $47 million for property  sales. Allied said its two major acquisitions of the last year, James Burrough  spirits and Dunkin Donuts coffee shops, had performed fully up to expectations,  even though they added sharply to interest costs.  </P></p>

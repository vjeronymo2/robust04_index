			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Geoffrey Varley] </F>   [Text] Paris, Jan 14 (AFP) -- The French left is pressing  ahead with plans for a massive demonstration here on Sunday [16  January] after claiming victory in a row with the conservative  government over private school funding.    The left hoped to convert a try into a goal after the nine  "wise men" of France's constitutional court cancelled the key  part of a controversial education bill that had revived the  country's long-running "schools war."    The Paris demonstration was originally planned to protest  the  new legislation which granted unlimited use of public funds to  the country's private, mainly Catholic, schools.    But the court slapped it down, ruling that the central  article of the bill was unconstitutional because it upset the  balance between the state and private school systems.    A crowd of between 300,000 and 350,000 was expected to march  through the city for most of the day on Sunday, grouping  teachers, students and parents' associations, trade unions and  freemasons as well as socialists and communists.    Organisers hired 66 special trains and 1,800 buses to bring  demonstrators into the capital from the provinces.    The court ruling was the left's first victory over  conservative Prime Minister Edouard Balladur since it was  heavily defeated in legislative elections last March.    Socialist Party leader Michel Rocard is eager to capitalise  on the win as his party prepares for a series of conferences  aimed at building a broad centre-left coalition ahead of next  year's presidential elections.    Rocard termed the ruling a "victory" for the left and  renewed  his calls for a big turnout on Sunday.    Balladur, who had come under fire from both left and right  after the education bill was rushed through the senate last  month in the middle of the night, beat a hasty retreat after the  court ruling.    Government spokesman Nicolas Sarkozy said it would be  "imprudent" to submit a new education bill for the moment while  Education Minister Francois Bayrou called for "dialogue" and  said he wanted to "restore the self-confidence of the state  education system."    One reason for going ahead with Sunday's demonstration was  the difficulty of calling it off at short notice, but Balladur  will be carefully watching the turnout and hoping that the  cancellation of the law will dampen enthusiasm.    It was undoubtedly a reversal for the prime minister but  this  was preferable to being forced to defend an increasingly  indefensible corner, analysts said.    Although Balladur has been consistently popular in opinion  polls since become prime minister in April, the schools law was  definitely unpopular, with most people believing that additional  funds for private schools could only come at the expense of the  public school system.    Polls this week showed that 50 percent of the French thought  the law was wrong against 34 percent who approved of it.  Another poll said that 40 percent supported Sunday's  demonstration, with 21 percent against and 30 percent undecided.    Socialist President Francois Mitterrand waded into the  controversy on Thursday, attacking Balladur for his "unfortunate  initiative" and cheering on the left.    Worse still, the bill was also criticised on the right.  Jacques Chirac, leader of Balladur's own neo-Gaullist Rally for  the Republic (RPR) party and a rival to the prime minister as  possible candidate in 1995 presidential elections, said he  "understands perfectly" that there were "reservations" about the  way the bill was voted.    Former conservative prime minister Raymond Barre strongly  attacked it as "a signal blunder" and called for a new  parliamentary debate. National Assembly speaker Philippe Seguin  weighed in with an ode in praise of the secular education system.    Balladur counterattacked, allocating 440 million dollars for  urgent repairs in state schools while arguing that the bill was  an "act of fairness" and "an election promise that had to be  kept."    That cash will still be spent, amid general relief in the  government that the constitutional court got it off the hook.</p>

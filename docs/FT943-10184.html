			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / International Company News: Nextel in Dollars 1.68bn Motorola assets deal Nextel Communications has advanced its bid to create a North American network for advanced mobile voice and data communications services with agreements to acquire Dial Page, a mobile radio services company , and the specialised mobile radio (SMR) assets of Motorola. The stock swap transactions are together valued at about Dollars 2.4bn. Nextel said it agreed in principle a tax-free merger with Dial Page for 28m Nextel shares which, at yesterday's price, were worth about Dollars 760m. In a separate transaction, Nextel will buy all of Motorola's special mobile radio licences and businesses in the US for 62m Nextel shares, worth about Dollars 1.68bn. Nextel said it is also committed to a 'substantial purchase' of equipment from Motorola over the next five years. Together with previous orders for equipment, this will enable Nextel to build over 4,000 transmission sites in the US covering about 85 per cent of the country, Nextel said. Nextel's goal is to create an advanced digital mobile communications service that will compete with existing cellular communications systems. Over the past 18 months, the company has acquired mobile radio spectrum rights from Motorola and several operators of SMR operators that provide radio dispatch services for taxis, delivery vans and the like. Nextel plans to use new digital technology from Motorola to convert these dispatch systems into integrated mobile telephone, messaging, dispatch and paging services. 'Combined with our recent agreements with leading SMR operators in Canada and Mexico, Nextel will be the first company to offer advanced integrated wireless voice and data communications, featuring digital clarity and reliability, a single telephone number that will work anywhere and availability across North America,' said Mr Morgan O'Brien, Nextel chairman. MCI Communications, which in March agreed to acquire a 17 per cent stake in Nextel for Dollars 1.3m, expressed its support for Nextel's expansion. 'Nextel's nationwide spectrum and coverage after these transactions gives it a unique position,' said Mr Richard Liebhaber, chief strategy and technology officer of MCI. Nextel and MCI are negotiating definitive agreements for MCI's planned purchase of Nextel shares , he said, and are also forming an alliance to jointly market wireless services nationwide under the MCI brand name.</p>

			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Kotani given suspended sentence THE MOST famed stock speculator of the 'bubble era' in Japan, Mr Mitsuhiro Kotani, was yesterday given an 18-month suspended jail sentence for what the Tokyo District Court described as the 'naked manipulation' of stock prices. Mr Kotani, 56, had pleaded guilty to manipulating the stock price of Fujita Kanko, a tourism company, but the court also condemned banks and brokers which assisted Mr Kotani's speculator group during its reign over Japanese markets in the late 1980s. The group, Koshin, bought shares in companies ranging from Janome, a leading making of sewing machines, to Kokusai Kogyo, an aerial survey company, which it first attempted to greenmail and then took over when the management was unwilling to buy back the Koshin stake. Mr Kotani admits that his group earned about Y31bn (Pounds 181m) through manipulating Fujita Kanko's price, which rose 40 per cent during one week in April 1990. The money was needed to complete the purchase of Kokusai Kogyo. While Mr Kotani admitted the charge, he suggested that he did not intend to deceive other investors into buying the stock, while his lawyers argued that Fujita itself and Tobishima, a formerly conservative construction company, had played an important role in the manipulation. In the late 1980s Mr Kotani, became one of the brightest stars of the 'bubble era'. His downfall, which came with the collapse of stock prices, has left a range of politicians and bankers open to criticism. A former environment minister was charged with tax evasion on profits allegedly made through Kotani stock tips, while the deputy head of Sumitomo Bank's domestic business division resigned to take responsibility for the bank's dealings with him. The court said yesterday that the securities companies which assisted Mr Kotani in his share raids and price manipulation were 'partly responsible' for the affair, and the Tokyo market had been 'far from fair and just'. Mr Kotani still faces a separate charge of extorting Y30bn from Janome, the sewing machine company.</p>

			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Treasury and Bank step up defence over sterling THE TREASURY and the Bank of England yesterday stepped up their defence of the pound's position in the European exchange rate mechanism in the face of renewed weakness on European currency markets. Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the Bank's governor, moved swiftly to counter damage to sterling following Thursday's criticism of its high value in the ERM from Mr Brian Pearse, Midland Bank's chief executive, and Sir Denys Henderson, ICI chairman. The UK monetary authorities were 'absolutely determined not to tolerate inflation', Mr Leigh-Pemberton said. 'This is why our commitment to the ERM is so important and unwavering as a means to that end,' he told a business seminar in London. Earlier, in an interview with the Daily Express, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, repeated his opposition to devaluation. It was 'fool's gold', he said, and would lead to higher, not lower, interest rates. Dealers said both the Bank of England and the Bank of Portugal intervened in yesterday's foreign exchange market trading, buying sterling after it fell below its permitted floor against the Portuguese escudo, which is the strongest ERM currency. The chancellor and the Bank governor were supported in their campaign by Sir Jeremy Morse, chairman of Lloyds Bank. Sir Jeremy said the pain inflicted by ERM discipline would have to be endured to reach the goals the government wanted. 'We are suffering the same pain that other countries did years ago,' he said. He poured cold water on the chances of a realignment of currencies in the ERM, unlike Mr Pearse and Sir Denys, who urged the government to work for such a move. After losing about one pfennig against the D-Mark in early European trading, the pound recovered to close unchanged in London at DM2.8425. It was at DM2.8413 in late trading in New York.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev believes that  currently there exists no direct military threat to Russia.  Interfax learned that this statement had been included in his  draft statement at the NATO Council of Defense Ministers in  Brussels on Tuesday. Grachev will speak on the Russian military  doctrine before the participants in the council late on May 24.    In accordance with the text of the statement, Russia regards  no state as its enemy. "Russia has no enemies but it has its  vital interests. We are ready to defend them and we are capable  of doing this," the statement underlined.    Grachev considered the development of bilateral and  multilateral agreements between the states and the participation  of Russia in joint security structures as priorities in the  sphere of security for Russia.    Grachev called stability in the regions close to its borders  as a prior condition for Russia's military security. "In all  that concerns the maintenance of international peace and  security Russia sees all states, the policy of which does no  damage to its interests, as its partners," the statement  emphasized.    Grachev stressed that development of cooperation with the  CIS  states with which it had signed the treaty on joint security  also was among Russia's priorities. He added that at the  regional level Russia was prepared to enhance cooperation with  all CSCE states.    Russia does not intend to limit itself to Europe, Grachev  pointed out. "In order to ensure security for our vitally  important interests we are obliged to take measures for the  establishment of a joint security system, including the  Asian-Pacific region."    Grachev underlined that the Russian armed forces had also  faced several untraditional tasks. They will:    -- carry out peacekeeping operations in accordance with the  decisions by the UN Security Council and other joint security;    -- cooperate with the Russian Interior Ministry forces and  law enforcement bodies in order to localize conflict zones and  to prevent armed clashes.    Commenting on the decision of the Russian leadership which  had decided not to confirm the obligations assumed by the former  USSR which said it would not be the first to use nuclear  weapons, Grachev stated that this did not mean that Russia would  subscribe to the concept of preventing nuclear strike. Russia  wants to eliminate the danger of a nuclear war by halting  aggression against Russia and its allies, Grachev stressed.    CIS and Eastern Europe defense ministers will also  participate in the meeting in Brussels.</p>

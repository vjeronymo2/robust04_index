			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow moves narrowly in program trading Wall Street WALL STREET dithered yesterday, with equities trading in a narrowly mixed range throughout the day, writes Karen Zagor in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was finally 1.79 off at 3,254.25 in unexceptional New York SE volume of 191m shares. The slim movement in US equity markets was also registered by the broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500, which ended 0.46 easier at 409.12. On Tuesday the Dow gained about 20 points. In the absence of any significant economic news, computer-driven program trading dominated activity. NBD shed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 28 7/8 after the Detroit-based banking group said it would acquire INB Financial, a large Indiana-based bank, in a Dollars 876m stock swap. Each INB share will be exchanged for 1.6 shares of NBD. Shares in INB soared Dollars 7 to Dollars 43 in active over-the-counter trading. Also in the secondary market, Chambers Development 'A' plunged Dollars 20 1/8 to Dollars 10 3/8 after revising its 1991 earnings to 3 cents a share from a previously reported 83 cents to reflect a change in accounting. Chambers predicted 1992 earnings of about 48 cents a share, sharply below analysts' expectations of about Dollars 1.05. Although analysts said that other waste management companies had already addressed the problems which are starting to affect Chambers, shares in a number of waste management companies fell. Waste Management was very active on the NYSE and tumbled Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 40 1/2 . Trading was also heavy in Blockbuster Entertainment, the video-rental chain, which eased Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 13 1/2 after Kemper Securities started coverage of the stock with an aggressive 'buy' rating. Federal Express dropped Dollars 6 to Dollars 49 1/4 after Moody's, the US rating agency, said it was reviewing the company for a possible downgrade. The stock had added Dollars 2 on Tuesday after the US express package delivery company revealed details of a big retrenchment of its loss-making European operations. A &amp; P, the West Coast supermarket chain, climbed Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 33. Although A &amp; P yesterday unveiled a sharp decline in fourth-quarter earnings to 42 cents a share from 83 cents a year earlier, it said that pressure on its profit margins had eased from the third quarter. A number of blue chip issues saw heavy trading, including AT&amp;T, up Dollars 3/8 to Dollars 39 3/8 , Chrysler, off Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 17 3/4 , and Citicorp, unchanged at Dollars 17 1/8 . Secondary stocks were firmer than big board issues through the day, with the Nasdaq composite ending 1.67 up at 624.94. High-tech stocks continued to dominate Nasdaq trading, with Sun Microsystems down Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 31 1/8 , Microsoft off Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 126 3/8 and Dell Computer Dollars  1/2 lower at Dollars 38 3/4 . Canada TORONTO stocks broke a five-session losing streak to end moderately higher after solid turnover. The composite index gained 12 points to 3,451.9, while advances narrowly exceeded declines by 276 to 255. Volume came to 31m shares. The consumer products sub-group led the sectors with a 1.97 per cent gain. Seagram jumped CDollars 6 1/4 to CDollars 139 3/4 . The company reported decreased earnings in its latest fiscal year, and said it will seek to split its shares on a four-for-one basis at its next annual meeting. If the split is approved Seagram will seek to raise its dividend 12 per cent.</p>

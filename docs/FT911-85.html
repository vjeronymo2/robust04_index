			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Brooke hopeful on reviving Irish talks MR PETER BROOKE, North-ern Ireland secretary, last night appeared hopeful that he could resuscitate talks on the province's political future. But he admitted that time was not on his side. After a fourth day of talks in Belfast with Unionist and nationalist leaders about the venue for talks involving the Irish government, Mr Brooke suggested he was making some headway in reaching a compromise. 'Serious business is being done,' he said. However, Mr Brooke was careful not to raise hopes after what has proved an acrimonious debate over the location for talks on relations between north and south Ireland. 'I don't think time is on our side,' he admitted, adding: 'I don't want to get overexcited.' The row has dominated the first two weeks out of the 11 set aside for the talks. At this stage the participants were supposed to be discussing devolved government in the province. Mr Brooke will meet Unionist leaders and the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party again today at Stormont parliament buildings outside Belfast. An incident yesterday which highlighted the cost of failure was the murder by the IRA of Mr Robert Orr, a businessman and member of the loyalist Orange Order. A bomb exploded under his car as he waited at lights in Armagh. Mr Brooke appears to have stopped short of issuing an ultimatum over a venue with the threat of ending the talks if agreement cannot be reached. He is understood to be working on variations of a proposal for holding talks with the Irish government first in London, then Belfast, then Dublin. Unionists insist they cannot hold talks with Dublin ministers anywhere in Ireland while the Republic's constitutional claim on Northern Ireland remains. The SDLP believes meetings should rotate between London, Dublin and Belfast.</p>

			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Wild stallion romps home: Saleroom AN UNUSUALLY dramatic painting by the 19th century horse painter John Frederick Herring Snr sold for Pounds 251,000 at Sotheby's yesterday. The painting, entitled 'Mazeppa', depicts the Ukranian general of that name strapped to the back of a wild stallion. It was the top price in an auction of British paintings that totalled Pounds 1.2m, with just more than 36 per cent unsold. It was not a bad result given the market's present state. The unsold percentage was boosted by the failure of Constable's 'Willy Lott's House' to find a buyer even though bidding reached Pounds 180,000, its low estimate. Stubbs' 'Horse frightened by a Lion' was sold for Pounds 104,500, at the bottom of its estimate. Among the successes were a contemporary painting of the young Prince Edward, later King Edward VI, attributed to the studio of William Scrotts. It sold above estimate for Pounds 52,800. 'Rownham Ferry with Portraits', by the short-lived early 19th-century painter Rolinda Sharples, doubled its estimate at Pounds 46,200, a record for this female artist. The National Army Museum bought a portrait of an officer of the 15th Light Dragoons by Tilly Kettle for Pounds 12,650, and the National Postal Museum paid Pounds 7,480 for two paintings by James Pollard depicting 19th-century Royal Mail coaches. Another museum buying yesterday was the Royal Armouries, which paid Pounds 6,600 at Christie's for a sporting gun given by Queen Victoria in 1868 to her favourite gamekeeper, John Brown. Christie's South Kensington on Tuesday celebrated its 25th year of auctions devoted to costumes and textiles. Top price at the sale was Pounds 16,500 paid by the US collector Cora Ginzburg for a chintz open robe made around 1770. Another robe of the same period, discovered in a costume trunk at London's Player's Theatre, sold for Pounds 6,820, three times its estimate.</p>

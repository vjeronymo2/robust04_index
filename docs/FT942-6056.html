			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / International Capital Markets: OM to concentrate on core activities OM Group, a Swedish company which runs derivatives exchanges in Stockholm and London, is selling its financing businesses and dropping plans to participate in founding a new Swedish bank in order to concentrate on core exchange and clearing operations. OM, operator of the OM Stockholm exchange and the OMLX exchange in London, said the surprise decision to restructure was prompted by the dramatic recent growth in volume of derivatives traded. 'We can see steady growth in the exchange and clearing business for derivatives, not least in London. With all the discussion going on about the risks, we think the demand for centralised clearing will grow,' Mr Olof Stenhammar, OM's founder and chief executive, told the Financial Times. He said that the combined daily volumes at OM Stockholm and the OMLX had jumped from 97,000 contracts in December to 135,000 contracts in May, with the daily value of clearing operations rising from SKr50bn to SKr70bn in the same period. OM Group, founded in the mid-1980s, is listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange. Its biggest shareholder is the powerful Wallenberg family, which holds a 21 per cent stake. Mr Stenhammar, who remains under investigation by the country's state prosecutor for insider trading allegations, which he strongly denies, owns 7 per cent. OM had intended to extend its interests in finance activities to founding a bank called Tre Kronor Bank in a joint project with a state pension fund and AFS, a financial services arm of Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish engineering giant. But Mr Stenhammar said this no longer fitted with group strategy. OM said the sale of its OM Finans division, which it hopes to complete by the end of this year, would increase its equity to assets ratio to around 70 per cent from 54 per cent at present. AFS and the pension fund issued a joint statement saying the Tre Kronor Bank project would no longer go ahead, despite initial approval from the banking authorities.</p>

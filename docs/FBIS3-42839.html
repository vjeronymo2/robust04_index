			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Oleh Lystopad, UKRAYINSKA HAZETA ecology </F> correspondent: "Just 70 Grams Could Destroy Odessa"]    [Text]  <H3>  Ukraine needs 40 million metric tons of oil. But this does  not mean that it must have an oil transshipment complex near  Odessa </H3>   At its meeting, the tender commission considered competitive  bids for the construction of an oil terminal (known as the oil  transshipment complex, or NPK) in the vicinity of Odessa. A  majority of the commission members voted in favor of the bids  submitted by the IVM company. The complex will be able to  receive 40 million metric tons of oil per year. The construction  of the first stage of this complex, with a planned capacity of  12 million metric tons, is to begin soon. But should we be in  such a rush to begin building?    We will begin by examining the numbers that I consider to be  most significant. These are official statistics. During the  unloading process, the average amount of oil spilled into the  sea is 70 grams per metric ton. This might seem like an  insignificant amount. But what happens when you multiply these  70 grams by 40,000,000 metric tons? You get 2,800 metric tons!  After absorbing this amount, "the world's bluest" [sea] will  turn black, disgusting, and dead. Specialists may say that I am  wrong. According to the calculations of Professor O.H. Myronov  (Sevastopol's Institute of the Biology of Southern Seas), the  Black Sea is supposedly capable of cleaning up 2,600 metric tons  on its own. This may be, but we are left with another 200 metric  tons, which is enough to pollute the entire Odessa bay and  Odessa's beaches (one cubic meter of oil, spreading as film,  covers ten square kilometers). This will start a chain reaction:  it will disturb the balance of the "water area -- atmosphere"  system, producing unexpected changes in climate and the mass  destruction of phytoplankton (in other words, the "lungs" of the  sea). There is more. Mollusks [rachky-chervyachky?] will die,  fish will die of hunger and lack of oxygen. And no new fish will  breed, because their eggs will have been destroyed even earlier.  We will not be the only ones affected. The Black Sea will be  completely devoid of fish and all living organisms, because the  Odessa valley [balka] accounts for 70 percent of the total  bioproductivity of the Black Sea. It acts as a kind of birthing  home for 60 percent of all the fish in the Black Sea.    And what about human health? Those who have managed to catch  such fish and eat it now lie hospitalized in cancer wards. The  toxic components of oil can accumulate in huge quantities in  fish.    Nor can we ignore the possibility of technical mishaps.  Consider an accident along the 25-mile-long pipeline, an  accident involving the equipment used to receive the oil.  Finally, an accident involving an oil tanker.    et us get back to statistics, which indicate that the number  of such accidents is growing with each year. In 1986 there was  only one accident that produced a large oil spill; in 1987 there  were five, in 1988 -- 21, and in 1989--39!. The sea in the  vicinity of Odessa resembles Derybasivska Street in Odessa  itself. But the most that a collision between two pedestrians on  Derybasivska Street can result in is an exchange of juicy  invective, whereas a collision at sea in which a tanker hits  something will spell tragedy for thousands, perhaps millions, of  people. Supporters of the terminal respond to concerns about the  threat of pollution to the sea by saying: we will call in the  oil clean-up vessels and they will remove everything. But the  director of the State Inspectorate for the Protection of the  Black Sea, S.K. Dolynskyy, is much more pessimistic on the  subject: it is possible to remove only 10 percent of the oil  that has been spilled.    Moreover, should one of our tankers "splatter" oil near some  foreign shores, we will have to pay huge fines and compensation  for serious losses. Not surprisingly, Turkey announced its  unwillingness to allow our tankers to pass through its straits.  The risk of collision in these narrow sea corridors rises  manifold. It appears, therefore, that in our attempt to free  ourselves of dependence on Moscow, we will end up just as  dependent on Turkey. Just like in the old days, when our hapless  hetmans sought the sultan's support against the tsar or the  tsar's against the sultan. It will be a sad day if, after  spending huge sums of money on this project, we will be unable  to use it because of our southern neighbor. Now that I have  broached the subject of politics, let me cast some light on the  situation with respect to the terminal from the political  standpoint. The point of the project is primarily political: to  make Ukraine independent of Russia. This means that either our  politicians and diplomats are unable to live in harmony with our  neighbors, or that this eighbor is an out-and-out villain. At  this point, we should mention another argument that is made in  support of the terminal. Russia's oil production is supposedly  dropping and there will nothing left for us to buy. Perhaps that  is so. But so far Russia is pumping oil to us. And even if we  have to pay for it in hard currency, I, as a politician, do not  much care to whom we pay this money--Iran or Russia. As an  ecologist, however, I am in favor of dealing with Russia,  because this will allow us to protect our benevolent sea from  oil.    And so, let us return to ecology. If we must ship in oil by  sea, what can we do to reduce the danger? In the first place,  the tankers should be unloaded in a closed port. The oil port  that has long been operating in dessa already has the capacity  to take in 4 million metric tons. Following reconstruction that  will take two weeks, it will be able to receive 8 million, and  after another six weeks, 12 million. Exactly the same amount  that the first stage of the future terminal is designed to  receive. In other words, we can receive the same amount of oil  but spend a lot less money if we opt for reconstruction. In  addition, this will be safer, because in the event that  "something happens," up to 90 percent of the spilled oil can be  removed in the closed area of the port, and the rest will  pollute only the port. The personnel of the Odessa port  submitted its proposals to all the institutions concerned, but  for some reason no one was interested. Could it be because they  would have to travel to Odessa to negotiate this matter rather  than to England?    Another way to prevent accidents is to reduce the tonnage of  oil tankers. Instead of the planned tankers with a capacity of  100,000-150,000 metric tons, we need tankers that will hold  one-third as much. Such vessels can be built at our own  shipyards--in Kerch, Kherson, and Mykolayiv. But for some  reason, Ukraine is placing orders for its tankers in the Federal  Republic of Germany instead. Our countrymen are left jobless.  The Ukrainian government is planning to feed German  shipbuilders. Why? It is up to the Security Service to determine  the reason. At the same time, it should assess this whole  project from the standpoint of security. The terminal can prove  a tasty morsel for terrorists--homegrown and foreign alike. Put  the sea portion of the terminal out of service and the whole  country is left without "black blood." The shore facilities are  even more inviting--they stand next to the Odessa port plant  [pryportovyy zavod]. In addition, the burning oil will produce  clouds of ammonia, which will transform Odessa into a cemetery  within hours. Our military has considerable experience in the  operation of terminals. If the need is really so great, it makes  more sense to use the existing terminals of the Black Sea Fleet.  Conversion in action! But perhaps we need not involve either the  Security Service or the Defense Ministry? We have, after all, a  Ministry of Environmental Protection! They are the ones who  should be sounding the alarm. Unfortunately, however, this  ministry is silent. And when it does speak up, it does so at  little more than a whisper. In talking with me, Minister Yuriy  Kostenko agreed that 40 million metric tons through a single  facility is too much. "This is contrary to the National Security  Program, which I helped to draft," he added. Yet the ministry  gave its approval for the construction of the first stage of the  terminal. In doing so, it did list many reservations. But why  agree to the project? It is not up to me to relate in detail the  position of this ministry. I expect that UKRAYINSKA HAZETA will  give the minister of environmental protection and other  organizations concerned in this matter an opportunity to do so  in future issues. But one dangerous problem remains--to devise  the safest way of shipping in the oil. Perhaps it would be  better to bring in some of the oil through the oil port and some  through the Black Sea Fleet's terminal. And the rest? But then,  is there anyone who can show concretely that today Ukraine needs  exactly 40 million metric tons of oil? And does this figure  include the eight million metric tons that our businessmen  shipped abroad last year?    Another fact is also interesting. Some people are now citing  a figure of 100,000-150,000 million metric tons rather than 40  million. According to the data of this same socioecological  alliance, in addition to the existing oil refinery in Odessa,  plans are now being drawn up for a second refinery, closer to  the terminal. The plans for the terminal itself include an  outport. This facility is designed for exporting not for  importing. Here is what it boils down to: the oil is shipped to  us, we refine it, give 50 percent to the owner of the oil and  keep the rest for ourselves. Plus all the smoke, dust, etc. In  other words, we are paying with the lives of our people to solve  the "gasoline" problem. Just like any banana republic. We will  sell the health of our citizens, but in exchange we will be able  to feed them so that they do not strike and do not demand early  elections to the Supreme Council.    For Ukraine, oil means its existence and independence. But  finding this oil must be left to people who are wise and who are  patriots of the land on which their children and the children of  their children will live after them.</p>

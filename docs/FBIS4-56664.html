			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Rumors indicating that right-wing political  leaders are ready to install a new government, challenging the  United Nations and U.S. President Bill Clinton, are circulating  in the Haitian capital. The British news agency, Reuters,  reports that Haitian businessmen are worried that the extreme  right is about to install a new de facto government. They report  that they [not further identified] have asked for the return of  Robert Malval as prime minister, a post he left with disgust  last December. They believe that having a legitimate leader in  this post could fill the temporal vacuum and reduce the  necessity to fill it.    Someone close to Malval refused to confirm or to deny the  speculation, stating that any approach might be be considered. I  cannot reject that, this official said. Depending on how it is  presented, Malval would have to wait and see of what the offer  consists. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Letter: Insider dealing and those in the know Sir, Those who worry about the extent of insider dealing sometimes fail to appreciate the natural potential effect of good and bad news in a free market. There are, of course, a few flagrant cases. But the very fact that a limited number of people close to a company know of good or bad potential means that, whereas most of them will not buy before good news, nor sell before bad - they are unlikely to do the reverse. Therefore, a part of those closest to the company - including advisers who might normally be sellers or supporters - will 'hold fire', reducing the weighting of one side of the market. Their absence from the market has its effect. This is especially true of small and medium-sized companies. Under the personalised jobbing system - pre-1986 - a jobber would soon have a quiet (or less quiet) word with the principals of any broking firm bringing suspicious business. In the new faceless market, matters are delayed and 'official'. Commercial standards are lower - as they are with companies settling debts - in spite of broader rules. For, as Mr Wally Giles of Barings said on the introduction of the Take-Over Code: 'If they had all read the 10 Commandments this would not be necessary'.

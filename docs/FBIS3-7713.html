			<p>Language: <F P=105> Burmese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mr. Goh Chok Tong, prime minister of the Republic  of Singapore, who is currently on a goodwill visit to Myanmar  [Burma], held a news conference with local and foreign  journalists at 1115 today at Seinle Kantha Guest House. The  news conference was attended by responsible officials; local and  foreign journalists; journalists from REUTER TV, NHK TV, KYODO,  and NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN; and freelance journalist Dominique  Faulder.    Singapore Prime Minister Mr. Goh Chok Tong said his trip to  Myanmar is part of current efforts to assess economic  opportunities for Singapore companies. He explained that  Singapore is encouraging entrepreneurs and investors to invest  in neighboring countries and that he had also visited the  People's Republic of China, Vietnam, India, Thailand, and  Indonesia in order to assess for himself the economic  opportunities in those countries. He said he was also able to  familiarize himself with political developments in those  countries and that he came to Burma with similar objectives.    Mr. Goh explained that the objective is to cooperate with  the  Government of the Union of Myanmar for investment in Myanmar and  to study how to persuade Singapore investors. He said economics  and politics are inseparable, and investors would like to know  about developments in Myanmar before building hotels, offices,  and factories. This is why he came -- to enable investors to  discover for themselves, and for himself to assess developments  in Myanmar.    The Singapore prime minister said he did not discuss the  issue of Myanmar's entry into ASEAN during his visit and he  believes it is still premature to discuss the issue. He said  Thailand, as host of the ASEAN meeting in July, can invite  Myanmar if it wishes and there is an identity of views on this  matter among the ASEAN nations.    He said Myanmar has some delicate problems regarding  economic  and political affairs. He said that economically Myanmar  authorities want to practice a market economy and attract more  tourists and foreign investment. He said the Government of  Myanmar fully understands the need for foreign investment and is  aware of the impact of economic development on politics. He  said that politically the Myanmar Government is striving to  obtain unity with ethnic organizations. He cited the holding of  the National Convention as a government undertaking. He said he  discussed this matter at considerable length. In his view, the  Myanmar Government has considerable problems in this regard. He  said he learned that efforts are being made to improve the  situation, and he expressed the hope that efforts appropriate to  the time will be undertaken.    Mr. Goh explained that he did not discuss human rights, but  he discussed Myanmar's political situation extensively with  Senior General Than Shwe and Secretary-1 Lieutenant General Khin  Nyunt. He said the discussions included matters relating to Daw  Aung San Suu Kyi. However, as the discussions were private, he  could not elaborate.    He said Singapore follows the International Declaration on  Human Rights and violations of human rights have an effect on  the foreign policy of a country. However, he recognizes that  human rights situations vary from country to country. He said  he believes trade will benefit the people of Myanmar as  international trade involves contact with people of other  countries and will enable them to understand the procedures  involved in international business.    Continuing, Mr. Goh said that trade and investment are on  the  rise in Myanmar and this in turn will greatly benefit Myanmar  society. He said he believes trade will benefit Myanmar society  in the long term, but he did not discuss the matter of using  Singapore as a model for developing Myanmar. The Myanmar  Government is increasingly welcoming investment from Singapore.  Singapore is interested in some sectors in Myanmar and he  believes that the two countries will be able to cooperate for  mutual benefit.    He said the outstanding success of Singapore can be  attributed to factors on all fronts. He said it is necessary to  create a correct situation and that in order to create such a  situation, an effective government is necessary, and such a  government should be capable of organizing the people to obtain  a common view. Furthermore, he said Singapore is located in a  region which is experiencing accelerated development. He said  Singapore is competitive internationally because it is able to  organize the strength of the people, although it does not have  any natural resources. He said, therefore, that it is necessary  to combine organizational skills, national leadership, and the  people's strength in order to create positive situations.    Mr. Goh recalled that he visited Myanmar for the first time  in 1980 and again in 1986. This is his third trip and he noted  many changes in the country. He said Yangon [Rangoon] is now  cleaner and the roads are wider with new buildings and renovated  old buildings. He said these are signs of genuine economic  improvement in the city of Yangon. He added that Myanmar  desires foreign investment and has become more open. He said he  believes prospects for progress in Myanmar are good, but he does  not want to compare Myanmar to other countries. He said the  ratio of the population to natural resources in Myanmar is very  favorable and Myanmar can be described as having the best  prospects in the region next to Malaysia.    He said Myanmar has many mineral, forest, marine, and  natural  resources and fallow and virgin lands. He said he views Myanmar  as a country very rich in natural resources and the exploitation  of these natural resources is still very low. This is why he  thinks Myanmar has very good potential. However, he said, it is  necessary to create positive conditions for foreign investors.    He said Myanmar has remained in self-isolation for many  years  and the present pressing economic problem is to link its economy  to that of the free international market. He said the process  will take time. He said there has been no foreign investment  because foreign investors are still assessing the situation in  Myanmar.    Mr. Goh said the Myanmar side has given a practical response  to foreign investors' concerns about the foreign exchange rate.  He said the Myanmar Government said that entrepreneurs already  know how to deal with the issue. He said the Myanmar side  recognizes the high value of the kyat and the fact that the  Foreign Exchange Certificate rate is based on the free market  rate, although it cannot be described as a blackmarket rate. He  said there is an official rate as well a free market rate. He  said the entrepreneurs know how to operate with these rates.    Mr. Goh said that although Myanmar has not officially joined  regional circles, it needs to show more openness if it wishes to  participate in regional affairs. He said he has encouraged and  urged the Myanmar leaders on this matter. He said economics and  politics are related and that there can be no economic relations  with Myanmar without good political relations. He said the  Singapore delegation came to Myanmar as a friend and it is  necessary to have mutual benefits in a market economy. He said  there should not be a one-sided situation wherein Singapore  enjoys 80 percent of the profits while Myanmar only enjoys 20  percent.    On the political front he urged Myanmar to return to the  international community as he mentioned in his speech. He said  at present Myanmar is isolated internationally and he believes  Myanmar should make efforts to return to the international  community.    He said Singapore wishes to assist Myanmar in developing the  tourist industry. In the next five years the number of tourists  visiting Myanmar will increase from the current 100,000 to  200,000 or 300,000. He said that as the tourist industry  develops, there will be more hotels, shops, and economic  enterprises. He said Myanmar is a very rich agricultural  country and he hopes it can meet domestic demand as well as  enter the international market. He said agriculture could  constitute a major export sector and expressed his hope that  Myanmar's economic undertakings will be successful.    Continuing, the Singapore prime minister said he believes  the  constructive engagement policy of ASEAN is correct. Myanmar  remained in self-isolation for many years, but it is now opening  itself economically to the world. He said the international  community can help Myanmar by holding constructive discussions.  He said because Myanmar has remained isolated for a long  period, the policy of isolation will not be successful. He said  efforts to make Myanmar more isolated will be in vain. He said  because of these factors, he decided to visit and hold talks  with the Myanmar leaders.    He said discussions on some matters were delicate and he  could not disclose details. He said Singapore was able to  present its views to the Myanmar side and encouraged Myanmar to  undertake certain measures. He said the main purpose of his  visit to Myanmar this time is to find markets for investment by  Singapore entrepreneurs. He said Singapore is well aware of the  economic potential of Myanmar, but at the same time Singapore is  aware of the delicate political situation.    He said he came to Myanmar because he believes that his  constructive discussions with the Myanmar leaders will help  normalize the situation and that the time is ripe for a visit to  Myanmar. He said he did not know whether the actions taken by  Western countries match their words. However, countries pay  great attention to economic relations. He said he urged Western  leaders and entrepreneurs to visit Myanmar themselves because  only then can they assess the situation in the country for  themselves. Furthermore, what is more important is that they  will be able to present their views to the Myanmar leaders. As  more leaders and entrepreneurs visit, they will have more  opportunities to present their views to the Myanmar leadership  and Myanmar will benefit further.    He said he discussed the political situation in Myanmar for  a  considerable time with Sr. Gen. Than Shwe and Lt. Gen. Khin  Nyunt. However, he said, his discussions were an expression of  his views on what should be done in the future and they do not  amount to giving advice. He said the discussions were private.    He said there was no pressure from the U.S. for improving  relations between Myanmar and Singapore. He said even if the  U.S. applies pressure it will not bring any results. He said  Singapore is an independent nation which practices an  independent foreign policy.    The news conference ended at 1140.</p>

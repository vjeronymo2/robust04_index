			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The licensee commenced operating on 24-month fuel cycles, instead of the previous 18-month fuel cycles, starting with fuel cycle 9. Fuel cycle 9 started in August 1992. Approximately 6 months after startup from 8/9 RFO, IP3 began an extended unplanned nonrefueling outage. Startup from the outage is currently expected for early 1995. After startup from the current outage, the plant expects to run until its next FRO 9/10 which is scheduled to begin in spring of 1996. In November and December of 1994, RHR containment isolation valves AC&hyph;732, AC&hyph;741, AC&hyph;MOV&hyph;743, AC&hyph;MOV&hyph;744, and AC&hyph;MOV&hyph;1870 are due for their Type C LLRT. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, the interval for Type C testing of these valves is 30 months. These LLRTs are normally performed during a refueling outage when the reactor is defueled and the RHR system is not providing a source of cooling water. The current outage is a nonrefueling outage; therefore, the reactor is not defueled and RHR system is providing core cooling water. The licensee's procedure and the system design require the RHR system to be out of service in order to perform the LLRTs. The licensee has requested a one-time schedular exemption to allow Type C LLRTs of the above listed valves to be deferred to provide additional time to finalize plans to accomplish this testing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NRC staff has reviewed the LLRT data provided by the licensee as well as methodology used by the licensee to extrapolate LLRT data to a 30-month test interval and the staff concludes that there is reasonable assurance that the containment leakage rate would be maintained within acceptable limits with a one-time LLRT interval increase until the return to power following the current outage, which is defined as prior T <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> avg <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  exceeding 350  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F. As a result, the application of the regulation in the particular circumstances is not necessary to achieve the underlying purpose of the rule. Thus, there are special circumstances present which satisfy the requirements of 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, the Commission has determined, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12, that (1) the exemption as described in Section III are authorized by law, will not endanger life or property, and are otherwise in the public interest and (2) special circumstances exist pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii).

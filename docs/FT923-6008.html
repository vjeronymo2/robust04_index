			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Tesco plans Pounds 30m depot TESCO plans to build its largest distribution depot in Britain on a site being developed by Gwent Europark, a consortium of developers, beside the M4 motorway at Newport, Gwent. The Pounds 30m project, conditional on obtaining government grants, would create 600 jobs within five years and is intended as part of a larger development that could create more than 2,000 jobs. The site is at the point where the M4 meets the road link to the second Severn bridge which is expected to open by 1996. If Tesco obtains a regional grant from the Welsh Office, it will develop 350,000 sq ft in a first phase - which would be the company's largest undertaking in Britain, in terms of both capital and floorspace. A second phase could see the depot extended to 500,000 sq ft. Tesco already has a 250,000 sq ft dry-goods depot at Chepstow near the Welsh end of the Severn bridge. The company is understood to have obtained planning consent for a similar depot near the English end of the second Severn crossing, but is unlikely to go ahead with that scheme if the grant is approved. Officals in the Welsh Office believe the scheme meets all the criteria necessary for financial support. Tesco's planning application for the Welsh depot, made in conjunction with Hoggett Lock Necrews, the Welsh arm of international architects Whinney McKay Lewis, is expected to be approved.</p>

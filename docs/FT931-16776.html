			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Cork Gully issues Harry Neal writ CORK GULLY, the receiver of the Harry Neal building group, has issued a High Court writ against the company's directors concerning a property deal nearly six years ago. The writ, which has not yet been served, concerns the company's sale of two buildings to Berrington Developments, a company partly owned by Mr Harry Neal, chairman of the building company. Cork Gully believes Mr Neal's involvement in Berrington was undisclosed. It says that was a breach of fiduciary duties by Mr Neal and seven other ex-directors of Harry Neal, who should pay damages for negligence or breach of contract. It said that the writ, which names all of Harry Neal's former directors, was drafted to cover all possibilities. When Harry Neal went into receivership in November 1990, it was owed Pounds 6m by Churchill Securities, Berrington's parent company, relating to deferred payments for the properties and their refurbishment. Cork Gully, which has not yet investigated the valuations of the buildings, has not alleged that the sale was made at an incorrect price. The writ was described as a protective writ, since it reserves Cork Gully's right to bring proceedings six years after the transactions took place, which is the normal time limit for legal action.</p>

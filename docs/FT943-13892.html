			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Compromise offer in Polish strike: A dispute between Warsaw steelworkers and Italian employers A bitter five-week strike by workers at the Warsaw steelworks, taken over two years ago by Lucchini, Italy's largest private steelmaker, reached a turning point at the weekend as strike leaders dropped plans to take control of production and offered the Italian management a compromise designed to open talks. In a landmark confrontation between the 3,400-strong Polish workforce and a foreign investor, Lucchini is demanding that the strike end before talks can start on their demand for a 30 per cent wage increase. But the gap between the two sides - which Catholic bishops acting as mediators are seeking to close - is large. Lucchini argues that the wage demand is too high. The workers, who earn an average Dollars 250 (Pounds 165) a month gross compared with Dollars 175 a month when Lucchini took over in 1992, say pay increases have not corresponded to either inflation or the 100 per cent rise in productivity over the last two years. Mr Andrzej Wieczorek, the deputy head of the Solidarity union's Warsaw region, yesterday threatened to step up protests if Lucchini did not accept the compromise proposal. He was speaking after a church service at the works at which the workers and their families heard Fr Henryk Michalak, a local parish priest, tell them: 'When there is a conflict between capital and labour, labour always comes before capital.' The workers' determination is fuelled by the feeling that the new Italian owners are failing to respect their past achievements. Under communist rule the plant, built in the 1950s, enjoyed prestige as a crucial supplier to the defence and engineering industries. Then, in the 1980s when the plant was a Solidarity stronghold, the authorities went out of their way to accommodate their requests. Even now it is a key supplier to local industries, including Fiat Auto Poland's Cinquecento plant in Bielsko. But a sign on the gate saying 'Welcome to the white blacks at Lucchini' implies that they feel they have been pushed into a neo-colonial situation. Workers complain that the foreign owners show them no respect. The mood contrasts sharply with the almost 100 per cent backing for the joint venture with Lucchini which the workforce, then 4,500 strong, voted in a referendum two years ago. At that time the Lucchini joint venture was seen as the only way out for the debt-laden works, which was beginning to recover from a sharp drop in sales in 1991 as Comecon markets collapsed. The agreement with Lucchini, which has a Polish government golden share giving it veto powers in the joint venture, commits the Italians to an Ecu150m (Pounds 115.5m) modernisation programme to cut costs while bringing output up to 1m tonnes a year from present annual sales of 300,000 tonnes, 15 per cent of which are exported. Last year Lucchini's output in Italy was 2.4m tonnes and the strategy in Poland was to position the company to be ready to supply the countries of the former Soviet Union once the area recovers. However, the modernisation plans ran foul of a complex land ownership situation. Lucchini says it did not know when it signed the initial deal that much of the steelworks was built on a former tsarist military training ground taken over in 1920 by the newly independent Polish state, which however failed to document its title to the land. The registration of ownership has taken 18 months to complete. Meanwhile, the International Finance Corporation, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and a group of Italian banks whose loan is to be guaranteed by SACE, the Italian credit agency, have held up the already arranged Ecu150m in modernisation loans until the land deeds were ready. The delay infuriated the workers, one of whose strike demands is that the modernisation be started immediately. Last year the group showed a net loss in Warsaw of 27bn zlotys (Pounds 780,000), against more than 400bn zlotys recorded in 1992, the last year of Polish management. Lucchini says it will not abandon its initial investment commitment - Ecu19m in cash and knowhow transfers and Ecu8.3m in promissory notes. Actual investment in Warsaw by the Italians has been a mere 100bn zlotys. The Polish government so far has backed the Italians. Mr Wieslaw Kaczmarek, privatisation minister, told parliament recently the strike was illegal and the blame for the delay in modernisation was to be laid entirely at the door of the Polish side. But the conflict has a nationalist undertone. 'Not only are you fighting for wages you deserve, you are also fighting for control of the nation's right to its means of production,' the strikers heard Fr Michalak say yesterday. If the stoppage is allowed to escalate, it will put question marks over the viability of foreign investment in Poland.</p>

			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / International Company News: Branches survive Swiss bank takeover CREDIT SUISSE said only 62 domestic branches would be closed following its SFr1.6bn (USDollars 1.1bn) takeover of Swiss Volksbank in March, significantly fewer than the 100 to 150 closures forecast at the time of the takeover. The benefits of the merger were proceeding more rapidly than expected, and the bank expected a SFr65m operating profit gain from it this year, Mr Josef Ackermann, chief executive. 'We are confident that we will achieve the planned SFr250m annual improvement in operating results by the end of 1995. In the medium term, we should do even better,' he said. Mr Ackermann added that the bank's operating results in the third quarter continued to be 'very good', but warned that provisions for bad loans would remain high because of the recession in Switzerland. The new branch plan means that the two banks together have the largest network in Switzerland, with 332 outlets. The group has chosen to cut 35 Credit Suisse branches, but only 27 Volksbank branches, reflecting Volksbank's stronger presence in Swiss retail banking. Volksbank would continue to be represented throughout the country, while Credit Suisse would concentrate on the larger centres and tourist resorts where its international reputation would be a competitive benefit. The original forecast of 2,000 job losses arising from the merger still held, but the bank hoped to avoid compulsory redundancies, Mr Victor Erne, personnel director, said. The more modest cuts appear to reflect the bank's sensitivity to public resentment of its high profitability at a time of deep recession in Switzerland.</p>

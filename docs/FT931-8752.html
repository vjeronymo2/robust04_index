			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Bonn gives the signal for railways reform THE German government yesterday approved a reform plan for the country's entire loss-making railway system, designed to relieve a DM70bn (Pounds 30bn) debt burden and pave the way for its privatisation. The west German Bundesbahn and east German Reichsbahn will be turned into a joint stock company from January 1 next year, but with its shares remaining in government ownership for the next 10 years. The entire plan requires the support of the opposition Social Democrats in order to gain the two-thirds majority needed in the federal parliament to change the constitution. Mr Klaus Daubertshauser, SPD parliamentary leader in charge of transport, said parliament would have to make sure the reforms did not jeopardise loss-making rail routes. The creation of a joint-stock company, called Deutsche Bahn AG, aims to free the railways' management from red tape and the vested interests of politicians. At the moment, any investment above DM5m requires the approval of the finance ministry. The reform will also remove the special status of many employees who, as public servants, have jobs for life and enjoy special benefits. The German Industry Federation, in a statement in support of the reform plans, said yesterday the railways could not operate if it remained subject to state-owned companies' regulations. But the change in employees' status might bring the government into deeper conflict with the Social Democrats and the unions, who want to protect the jobs and benefits of the railways' employees. The means of financing the rail reform is likely to create further political conflict. Last week, the government's three coalition parties agreed to levy a yearly fee on users of motorways and to transfer the revenues to the railways. But the proposal was denounced by Greens and politicians from all sides. Equally controversial is the possibility of raising a petrol tax to finance the railway reforms. A government working group is due to come up with a report on both issues on March 10. The loss-making railways will have debts of DM70bn by the end of this year and interest payments of DM12bn. Mr Gunther Krause, the transport minister, said that without reform the railways' debt would climb to DM569bn by 2003. The reform package should reduce this to DM139bn, he said.</p>

			<p><P> October 26, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ASK THE VET: FEVERISH CAT MAY SUFFER VIRAL INFECTION  </P> <P> Q. In the past three months, our 2-year-old male cat has had frequent episodes  of fever during which he stops eating for one to three days, is listless and  seeks places to hide. He later snaps out of it and starts to act normal again,  playing and eating well. We had him vaccinated about six months ago when we had  him neutered. Could the surgery have caused some sort of problem to develop? We  had him examined one time, and the vet started him on some antibiotics and  Nutracal, which seemed to help him quite a bit. What could be the cause? He's  the only cat that we have and is fed Crave dry food and a variety of canned  foods. What do you think?  </P> <P> Jenny Gilbert, Irvine  </P> <P> A. Frequent or reoccurring fever episodes are generally associated with viral  infections or chronic diseases. To determine if your cat really has a fever,  you need to use a child's rectal thermometer and take your cat's temperature  rectally. The normal range is usually between 101 and 102.5 degrees, depending  on the age and activity of the cat. If your cat is truly running increased  temperatures and they are frequent, it is wise to have him examined by your vet  again. The doctor will probably take a blood sample to do a Complete Blood  Count (CBC) and a chemical profile to evaluate organ functions. The cat should  definitely be tested for leukemia virus (FeLV), feline immunosuppressive virus  (FIV) and feline infectious peritonitis (FIP).  </P> <P> The examination should also include a urinalysis to help determine if your cat  is suffering from urinary disease. If the CBC is markedly abnormal and  indicates a bacterial infection -- and no other causes can be determined -- a  series of blood cultures may be necessary. Antibiotics may be given for several  weeks, and follow-up examinations and tests may be necessary.  </P> <P> Do not give your cat any aspirin or Tylenol-like products. They can be very  toxic and possibly fatal. I doubt that the surgery would be the cause for such  persistent episodes but do have your kitty examined.  </P> <P> Q. Regarding the cat with continuing diarrhea, our Siamese started having this  trouble about a year ago. After much veterinary study, it was found that she  was (or became) allergic to milk (when in the food). When we cut out all food  with dried milk products, the diarrhea stopped. She's about 12 years old, and  we found that this is possible in older animals.  </P> <P> Now, what do you do with a cat that has a hairball in the stomach? Lots of  Laxatone isn't working.  </P> <P> Ruth Glunt, Los Alamitos  </P> <P> A. It is true that milk or milk products will cause soft stools to fluid  diarrhea in most dogs and cats. This is because they do not have sufficient  enzymes in their digestive systems to break down the milk proteins. These  undigested products will start to draw fluid from the intestinal tract and  cause diarrhea. Also the proteins can induce allergic conditions, which can  upset the digestive tract and prevent absorption of the other nutrients,  leading to diarrhea. This is true for kittens and puppies as well as adult  animals.  </P> <P> If your cat does have a hairball lodged in the stomach that she cannot pass, it  may be necessary to anesthetize her and have her stomach examined with an  endoscope to identify the problem. The hair might have to be removed in  fragments with an instrument passed in the scope. If it is too large to remove  this way, abdominal surgery will be necessary to open the stomach and remove  the obstruction. Radiographs (X-rays) should be taken before any of the  procedures are done to determine if they are necessary.  </P></p>

			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Patten promises HK will tackle rising home prices The Hong Kong government is to develop a comprehensive set of proposals to deal with the issue of rising house prices, Mr Chris Patten, the colony's governor, said yesterday. The governor said rising property prices were the top issue facing Hong Kong. 'It is an exceptional problem and I think it will demand exceptional measures,' he said. Home ownership is one of the main aspirations of people in Hong Kong. But analysts say that due to a government policy which restricts the supply of land for residential development, prices have been kept artificially high. In 1993, residential property prices rose by an average 28 per cent compared with the previous year. At the luxury end of the market, prices were up by more than 50 per cent. Mr Patten, who left for Europe last night, said he had instructed senior civil servants to develop proposals for action by the early summer. There were no simple solutions to the problem, he declared. Property market analysts said the problem of high residential property prices could be solved by an increase in the supply of land. Mr Peter Churchouse, managing director of Morgan Stanley, said: 'The government is absolutely appalling in its land policy. It runs a high land-price policy which has meant land prices are twice what they should be.' High residential property prices have caused a storm of protest in Hong Kong. Elected politicians have warned of unrest among frustrated home buyers who cannot afford the price of entry into the residential market. A 600 sq ft flat costs around HKDollars 2m (Pounds 173,460). Property developers have also been accused of rigging the property market by holding back from release completed homes. Prof Edward Chen, a member of Mr Patten's Executive Council, and chairman of the Consumer Council, has alleged developers are holding back up to 50 per cent of flats completed last year. Even Beijing has joined the debate, with officials criticising mainland companies for speculating in the colony's property market. Mainland Chinese investors are estimated to have invested up to a quarter of funds expended on property in Hong Kong last year.</p>

			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Recovery in car sales falters The fragile recovery in west European new car demand was halted last month as sales fell by 1.6 per cent year-on-year to 1.08m, according to industry estimates. New car sales were higher than a year ago in each of the first three months, but the market was hit last month by a sharp fall in demand in Germany as well as by lower sales in several of the smaller European markets. In the first four months new car sales have risen by 3.8 per cent to an estimated 4.33m. Sales in the whole of 1993 plunged by more than 15 per cent, the steepest decline of the post-war period. In Germany, the biggest single market in Europe, new car sales fell last month by an estimated 13 per cent to 295,000 and have declined by around 1.7 per cent to 1.16m in the first four months. Sales fell last month in 10 of 17 markets across west Europe in contrast to the improvement of the first quarter. In the first four months of the year sales were higher than a year ago in 11 west European markets. Last month new car demand remained strong in the four main Nordic countries and most importantly in France, where sales rose by 17.2 per cent year-on-year. The rate of growth slowed, however, in Spain, as well as in the UK, where consumer confidence has been dented by tax increases. PSA Peugeot Citroen of France has drawn level with General Motors of the US (Opel in continental Europe and Vauxhall in the UK), in second place in the west European market. Helped by the strong recovery in new car sales in France and in Spain - it is the market leader in both countries - the Peugeot Citroen group has increased its sales volume by an estimated 11.3 per cent in the first four months this year. It has raised its market share to 12.7 per cent from 11.8 per cent a year ago. Japanese new car sales in west Europe have fallen by an estimated 6.3 per cent to 486,000 in the first four months, as Japanese carmakers struggle to keep their prices competitive under the impact of the rising yen. Japanese carmakers without production in Europe have been hardest hit, with Mitsubishi sales falling by 18.9 per cent and Mazda sales declining by 8 per cent. Mercedes-Benz increased sales volume by 39 per cent in the first four months of the year, helped by the launch last year of its C-Class executive range, overtaking arch-rival BMW.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                  WEST EUROPEAN NEW CAR REGISTRATIONS                          January-April 1994  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                            Volume    Volume    Share (%)   Share (%)                           (Units)  Change (%) Jan-Apr 94   Jan-Apr 93  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL MARKET           4,332,000      +3.8       100.0        100.0  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- MANUFACTURERS: Volkswagen group         714,000      +0.9        16.5         17.0  -Volkswagen             469,000      -2.6        10.8         11.5  -Audi                   115,000      -2.2         2.7          2.8  -Seat                   111,000     +19.7         2.6          2.2  -Skoda*                  19,000     +21.1         0.4          0.4 General Motors****       550,000      +4.7        12.7         12.6  -Opel/Vauxhall          526,000      +3.9        12.2         12.1  -Saab**                  18,000     +30.6         0.4          0.3 PSA Peugeot Citroen      550,000     +11.3        12.7         11.8  -Peugeot                325,000      +7.7         7.5          7.2  -Citroen                225,000     +16.8         5.2          4.6 Ford****                 510,000      +4.0        11.8         11.7  -Ford Europe            505,000      +3.9        11.7         11.7  -Jaguar                   4,000      +9.5         0.1          0.1 Fiat group********       490,000      -0.3        11.3         11.8  -Fiat                   379,000      +3.3         8.8          8.8  -Lancia                  64,000      -9.8         1.5          1.7  -Alfa Romeo              42,000     -14.9         1.0          1.2 Renault                  454,000      +3.3        10.5         10.5 BMW group***             266,000      +6.0         6.1          6.2  -BMW***                 134,000      -0.7         3.1          3.2  -Rover***               132,000     +13.9         3.0          2.8 Mercedes-Benz            154,000     +39.2         3.6          2.7 Nissan                   147,000      +0.1         3.4          3.5 Toyota                   114,000      -5.9         2.6          2.8 Volvo                     71,000     +22.1         1.6          1.4 Mazda                     71,000      -8.0         1.6          1.8 Honda***                  56,000      +2.8         1.3          1.3 Mitsubishi                42,000     -18.9         1.0          1.2 Suzuki                    30,000     -20.8         0.7          0.9 Total Japanese           486,000      -6.3        11.2         12.4  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- MARKETS: Germany                1,160,000      -1.7        26.8         28.3 Italy                    708,000      -6.9        16.3         18.2 United Kingdom           671,000     +14.1        15.5         14.1 France                   638,000     +13.8        14.7         13.4 Spain                    271,000     +13.3         6.2          5.7  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *VW holds 31 per cent and management control of Skoda. ****Includes cars imported from US and sold in western Europe. **GM holds 50 per cent and management control of Saab Automobile. ******** Fiat group includes Lancia, Alfa Romeo, Innocenti, Ferrari and Maserati. ***BMW owns 80 per cent of Rover group and is to acquire the remaining 20 per cent from Honda.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: industry estimates  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

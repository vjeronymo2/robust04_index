			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, April 1 (XINHUA) -- Several Malaysian  companies together with their multi-national partners have  decided to join China's entertainment and film industry.    This was proved by the signing of several agreements here  today, which was witnessed by Malaysian Minister of Trade and  Industry Rafidah Aziz.    The agreements worth a total of 60 million U.S. dollars are  principally for the establishment of integrated entertainment  centers, comprising multiplexes and dynamic motion simulators in  Shanghai and other cities of China, Ramli Kushairi, chairman of  South Malaysia Industries (SMIB) told newsmen here today.    SMIB is a big shareholder in the proposed projects. The  venture partners are United Cinemas International owned by  Paramount Pictures and Universal MCA, and China Venturetechno  International and Shanghai Paradise, a leading Chinese  entertainment company listed on Shanghai's stock market.    The international standard multiplexes to show the latest  films "will meet the needs of the more affluent and discerning  Chinese consumers", Ramli said.    The first multiplex would be opened in Shanghai in January  1995, he said.</p>

			<p><P> September 25, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. SAYS IT CAN'T BALANCE WORLD TRADE ALONE  </P> <P> The United States warned Sunday that it cannot reduce its outsized trade  imbalances on its own, and called on West Germany and Japan to step up their  efforts to trim their trade surpluses, which are the mirror image of America's  trade deficit.  </P> <P> In a speech before the policy-setting Interim Committee of the International  Monetary Fund, U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady reiterated American  calls for the two trading partners to spur more demand at home and open up  their economies to more U.S. exports.  </P> <P> "The United States cannot solve the world's problems alone," Brady told the  closed meeting, according to a portion of his remarks that was made public by  the Treasury. "We cannot reduce our external deficit unless surpluses elsewhere  decline."  </P> <P> He also repeated warnings by finance ministers of the United States and its  major economic allies that the dollar's value has risen too far. And he vowed  new joint action by the allies in the foreign exchange markets to help keep the  dollar in check.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Massive Intervention  </P> <P> Brady's remarks came as the Group of Seven, as the finance ministers' group is  known, made preparations for what is expected to be massive intervention in the  markets today as currency traders try to test the resolve of the industrial  countries' central banks. In addition to the United States, the group includes  Britain, Japan, West Germany, France, Italy and Canada.  </P> <P> The seven warned in a communique on Saturday that any further increase in the  value of the greenback could hurt the world economy. The ministers are worried  that if the dollar rises any more it could reverse recent progress in reducing  the U.S. trade deficit.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Brady and the finance ministers of West Germany and Japan joined in  rejecting a plea by developing countries to approve a new issue of "special  drawing rights" -- artificial reserve assets that developing countries want  used to provide added aid.  </P> <P> Brady and finance ministers Theo Waigel of West Germany and Ryuarto Hashimoto  of Japan all argued that Third World countries had not made a convincing case  that more SDRs were needed. They also declined to increase the maximum limits  for IMF borrowing by poor countries.  </P> <P> The IMF and its sister organization, the 152-country World Bank, are scheduled  to begin four-day-long annual meetings here today, with the major debate over  whether to grant an IMF request for a doubling of its lending resources.  </P> <P> The United States still opposes any such move, contending that the IMF still  must define more fully what its role will be in the next decade. Most other  industrial countries have said they will back a small increase in IMF  resources, but not the doubling that the IMF would like.  </P> <P> In a related development Sunday, the Group of 10, which comprises finance  ministers of 11 large industrial countries, pledged to try to resolve the  conflict in lending resources and bring the issue to a vote by the end of the  year.  </P> <P> The group also underscored Brady's assertion that the industrialized countries  need to do more to help trim back huge global trade imbalances. But the  ministers stopped short of admonishing West Germany and Japan on what to do.  </P></p>

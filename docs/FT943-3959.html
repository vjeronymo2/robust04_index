			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Clinton's foes on scent of 'fast-track': Threats to the power to negotiate trade pacts Virulent partisanship in the US Congress, which nearly killed popular crime legislation last month and threatens proposed health insurance reform next month, could claim another victim: the fast-track negotiating authority President Bill Clinton needs to secure new trade pacts with Latin America and Asia. With just four weeks left before Congress is due to recess for elections, time is running short for agreement on many disputes surrounding the legislation needed to implement the Uruguay Round world trade deal under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Among the problems yet to be resolved is how to raise funds to compensate for reduced revenues due to tariff cuts agreed in the round. Failure by Congress to approve legislation before it recesses would severely jeopardise Gatt members' pledge in April to ratify the round in time to put it into effect and establish the new World Trade Organisation at the start of next year. Not only is it inconceivable that the timetable could be kept if foot-dragging by Congress prevented the US formalising its commitment to the round; delay in Washington could provide a pretext for other governments to defer parliamentary approval of the deal, raising the risk of indefinite slippage. So far, fewer than 30 of the 125 participants in the round have ratified it. Outlook for action by the EU is clouded by a jurisdictional dispute between the European Commission and the Council of Ministers, while there are also uncertainties about the timetable in Japan. In the face of the mounting obstacles in Congress, the Office of the US Trade Representative is understood to be weakening in its resolve to seek renewal of President Clinton's 'fast-track' authority to negotiate further trade agreements. A request for such authority, which requires Congress to vote on legislation without amendment, was included in the Uruguay Round package at a time when it seemed non-controversial. Matters have been complicated by Senator Robert Dole, the Republican minority leader, who has made frustration of the president's legislative agenda his top priority. In a much publicised recent article in a newspaper in his home state of Kansas, he argued for a postponement of the Gatt legislation while questions of its costs and its effects on US laws were assessed. Mr Dole's stance has been welcomed by the round's opponents on the left and right, who have argued for delay in the hope that with more time they can mobilise enough opposition to kill it. Adding to their glee, Mr Rush Limbaugh, the right-wing chat show, crusader has come out against the WTO. The White House is said to be still reluctant to give up fighting for fast-track, which it deems vital for the president's credibility when he meets Asian leaders in Jakarta in November and Latin American leaders in Miami in December. A decision could come soon, but observers of past decisions by President Clinton's White House are expecting a cave-in. The fast-track is in most trouble in the Senate, which failed to include the necessary authorisation in its own version of implementing legislation. Trade officials then met Republican congressmen and got it included in the House version, after they reluctantly agreed to drop labour and environmental issues as specific goals to be sought in future trade negotiations. Staff members of the Senate finance committee and the House ways and means committee are now working to resolve differences in the two versions, so the legislation can be sent to the White House and returned to Capitol Hill in time for final votes this year The administration is widely accused of fumbling passage of the Gatt legislation by not moving sooner to settle the tariff revenue problem, by incorrectly assessing congressional sentiment and by taking a strident position on the labour and environmental issues in the hope of satisfying the Democratic left. A former senior Bush administration official said Republicans and business lobbyists were alarmed by the 'boasts' of Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, that all future trade deals would seek to raise the environmental and labour standards of foreign trading partners. On the other hand, Senator Dole is displaying 'the worst type of partisan manipulation of trade issues' which 'will not serve him well,' he said. If, as expected, the Republicans gain seats in both houses in November, President Clinton could have even more difficulty pushing fast-track authority through Congress next year. That, in turn, would be a humiliating setback to US plans for hemispheric integration and trade initiatives in Asia.</p>

			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / International Company News: Hong Kong and Shenzhen in talks on dual listing SHARES listed on the Shenzhen stock exchange in southern China could be traded on the Hong Kong stock market if talks under way between the two markets bear fruit, according to officials of the Shenzhen exchange. The dual listing would cover 'B' shares, which are listed in Shenzhen but may only be traded by foreigners and paid for in foreign currency. However, the proposal still has to be approved by authorities in both China and Hong Kong. The Shenzhen officials were in London yesterday as part of a round-the-world trip with Credit Lyonnais Securities Asia. They are also visiting Edinburgh, Paris, New York and Washington. They held talks with the London Stock Exchange and made a presentation to brokers and fund managers. The Shenzhen market, one of two stock exchanges in China, has met huge investor demand since it began trading in December 1990. This reflects growing prosperity in Shenzhen, a special economic zone bordering Hong Kong, as well as in the rest of southern China. Foreign investors are attracted by the sharply rising market and the opportunities opening up in China. Questions from British-based institutions reflected their hesitancy to become involved. They concerned the violence surrounding queues outside Shenzhen brokers' offices, information provided by listed companies, the quality of new issue prospectuses, pricing of new issues, gaps between payment for new issues and listing, absence of securities law, and failure to consolidate subsidiaries in accounts. Mr Zhen Qinan, assistant general manager of the exchange, said Beijing officials had recently visited it and were drawing up a securities law which would cover insider trading, fraud and investor protection. Mr Zhang Hongyi, vice-mayor of Shenzhen, said funds were being formed with the aim of creating investing institutions for the domestic 'A' share market and removing part of the speculative element. However, officials admitted that regulations were still inadequate.</p>

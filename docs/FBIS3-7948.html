			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Regular weekly interview with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus </F> by station editor Lucie Weissova; place not given--live or  recorded]    [Excerpts] [Weissova] Prime Minister, you had talks  yesterday with Polish Sejm Speaker Mr. Oleksy. At the same  time, you said that Czech-Polish relations are of absolute  priority for us. Can you explain why they are more important  for us than, for example, relations with Slovakia or Germany?    [Klaus] I certainly did not say that they are more important  than relations with Germany or Slovakia. I think that it was  necessary to use this visit to dispel certain doubts which  continue to exist on the Polish side. They have lasted for four  years. If you remember, there was an occasion when we did not  open small-scale border contacts. On another occasion, we did  not want to solve the questions (?anew). We almost forgot that.  And there was something else for the third time.    At the moment there have been complications as regards our  weak attitude toward the Western countries regarding entry to  NATO and the Partnership for Peace. Part of the Polish press  continues to create the impression that we want to do something  against Poland or without Poland and so on.    So I am glad that this visit has taken place and I was quite  conscious in uttering those welcoming sentences, but it  certainly did not mean putting these relations above Slovakia or  something like that.    [Weissova] Nevertheless, the mass media often criticize our  government for the relations which it has with its neighbors,  for example, as far as the countries of Visegrad are concerned,  they blame the Czech Republic for not wanting to progress in a  coordinated way, for wanting to be isolated. The kernel of  discord between us and Austria is Temelin. Relations with  Germany are complicated by the Sudeten German question and  criticism of our government appears in the mass media regarding  its foreign policy toward neighbors. Do you agree that this  policy does not take sufficient consideration of tactics  concerning these sensitive questions?    [Klaus] I certainly do not agree with it. If we had no  neighbors we would have no problems with neighbors. [passage  omitted] I simply cannot agree that our policies are  irrational, inconsistent, and badly thought out. This is not  true, and I cannot imagine what kind of policies we should  conduct for them to be better. Should we go for the Austrian  blocking of Temelin? Would it be better foreign policy?  [passage omitted] The fact that we are being criticized by a  small fraction of the German press, in my view, is evidence that  we are doing things correctly.    [Weissova] Prime Minister, NATO planes have interfered in  Bosnia. What do you think about this resolute step? Can this  demonstration of NATO determination contribute toward ending the  protracted conflict or, on the contrary, worsen it?    [Weissova] I do not like to pass absolute judgements  because,  as I have understood up to now, or at least up to this morning  as we are talking, it was not clear at all what kind of planes  they were, which sides were involved, and what was behind it.  We know very well that in this strange war there are a lot of  strange activities by individuals going on which are not  completely synchronized and coordinated with the others.  [passage omitted]    [Weissova] Events in Hebron on Friday, where a Jewish  settler, a doctor, shot dozens of praying people, shook the  world by its scale and manner. You were recently in Israel and  met its top representatives. You saw the complicated problems  there: Do you think that this action could jeopardize or make  it impossible to bring peace to the area?    [Klaus] I am worried. I am really worried that this is a  huge blow to all peace talks. What really makes me concerned is  my feeling that a massacre on this scale could not be the work  of one individual, however mad he was. It had to be prepared,  there had to be some sort of logic and support behind it. This  is why I am worried that this was not an isolated deed committed  by someone who deals with problems of the world in this mad way.  And this is what bothers me. It would indicate that something  similar can happen again and this is really bad.    I have seen the swift reactions of Israel in its obvious  counter- gesture of releasing thousands of Palestinian captives  in an attempt to rectify this dreadful deed.    I have seen this problem, the internal political conflicts  in  the Israeli parliament. I saw there at the same table  representatives of a group that would never negotiate with  Palestinians opposite a group which wants the negotiations. I  am afraid that what happened has added complications to a  problem which is already difficult.    [Weissova] My last question is about coupon privatization in  the Czech Republic. The completion date for the preparatory  round of the second wave has been finally set. [passage  omitted] Why was this preliminary round so long? Was it  necessary?    [Klaus] [passage omitted] All enterprises which are to enter  the second wave of coupon privatization must have their annual  accounts settled. This takes time and it could not be done any  quicker. If this took place three months earlier or later and  the annual balancing did not come into it, it could have been  done faster.</p>

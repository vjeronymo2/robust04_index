Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, accused the Government  of making "no attempt to bring us on board" and said he wanted  Mr Major to abandon what he called the Unionist veto over future  moves towards a united Ireland.    There was now "a standoff," he said. "If the republican  struggle needs to continue for the next 25 years, then so be it.  We continue for the next 25 years."    Nearly four weeks after the declaration was signed at  Downing  Street by Mr Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, Ireland's prime  minister, doubts remain over whether the IRA is prepared to give  up violence and enter the political process.    Mr Major, interviewed by Sir David Frost on BBC television  yesterday, said he was still prepared to wait for an answer, but  his patience was not inexhaustible. He also accused Sinn Fein of  trying to muddy the waters by seeking further clarification.    "What at present is going on is that they are seeking to  muddy that issue, to enter into negotiations effectively without  giving up violence," Mr Major said.    "Well that is not on offer. They do have to give up violence  and then the way forward to a democratic future is perfectly  clear, and the way forward for them to get into the talks about  the democratic future for Northern Ireland is perfectly clear."    At the weekend, Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist SDLP  [Social Democratic and Labour Party], urged the Prime Minister  to agree to Sinn Fein's request for clarification set out in a  letter sent by Mr Adams to Downing Street. Labour's spokesman,  Mr Kevin McNamara, also believes Sinn Fein is justified in  asking for further interpretation and there are signs of growing  strains between London and Dublin over the issue. Mr Reynolds  is due to make a keynote speech later today setting out where he  thinks the process is leading.    But the Prime Minister won support for refusing to be drawn  further on the declaration from Mr John Smith, Labour party  leader. He appeared to differ with Mr McNamara when he said:  "The danger is that we enter into negotiations before we have  got the abandonment of violence."    Mr Major clearly believes he has gone as far as he can in  seeking to accommodate the Provisional IRA without losing  backbench support.    "I think what Mr Adams is about is seeking to drag us into a  negotiating position. I am not going to be drawn into  negotiations by the back door by Mr Adams."    Mr Major denied Sinn Fein's suggestion that the Government  has not done enough to bring the IRA into the political process.  "We have offered them much more than the extra mile," he said.  "We have offered them a route into the democratic talks  themselves. That is what is on offer. All they have to do is  give up violence."    Mr Major, who again ruled out an amnesty for convicted  terrorists, indicated that the time was approaching when a  definitive Sinn Fein response was needed. "I have said I am  prepared to be patient. It is worth a little patience while  they examine whether they are going to give an affirmative  answer to give up violence.    "The world does not stop during that period.... I can be  patient for a little while. There will come a time when it is  apparent that they are not going to respond. We will know  it--rather like an elephant, you will know it when you see it.    "It can't be too long, but I am prepared to be patient for a  little while."</p>

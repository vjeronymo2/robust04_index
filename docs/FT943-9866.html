			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / Curriculum cuts to deepen Cuts in the compulsory national curriculum for England and Wales from September next year are to be deeper than planned, the government's curriculum body said yesterday. The move follows responses by teachers' unions to the provisional new curriculum unveiled in May by Sir Ron Dearing, chairman of the Schools Curriculum and Assessment Authority. The unions said the curriculum would not deliver the government's aim of ensuring that at least 20 per cent of classroom time up to the age of 14 could be spent studying non-compulsory subjects chosen at teachers' discretion. At present most teachers believe that the compulsory elements of the curriculum take up all available classroom time. No further cuts will be made to mathematics and English, and so the cuts are likely to be in the other subjects, which include science, history, geography, modern languages, art, music, physical education and religious education.</p>

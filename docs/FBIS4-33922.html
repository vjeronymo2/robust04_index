			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Edwige Balutansky] </F>   [Text] Port-au-Prince, 13 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Representatives  of international organizations in Haiti reported here today  attacks on their personnel by members of the Revolutionary Front  for the Promotion and Progress of Haiti (FRAPH).    The officials of these organizations told the media that  they  do not want to travel in the official vehicles of their  organizations because the FRAPH violently confiscates them. It  was learned last week that customs personnel at the Haitian  international airport confiscated, without apparent reason,  bulletproof vests and uniforms from members of the U.S. Marine  Corps.    Regarding the topic, the (?mysterious) confiscation of  communications material and defense weapons was made by regular  military forces and not by "armed civilians as the alleged  civilian mission affirms." "This material has been confiscated  because it was not registered anywhere," the communique stated.    This weekend, two individuals who identified themselves as  FRAPH members violently seized an official vehicle from a  64-year-old driver. The FRAPH is a paramilitary group linked to  the Haitian Army. It has been identified by the OAS-UN Civilian  Mission and international organizations as responsible for the  violence and the repression of popular organizations and  supporters of ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.    Meanwhile, airplane tickets for flights through 25 June have  sold out. That is the date when the United States will suspend  its commercial flights to Haiti. Air Canada has already  canceled its flights effective this Monday and announced it will  make a special flight on Wednesday in response to the Canadian  Embassy's recommendation to Canadians to leave the country  before 25 June.    Political observers have expressed surprise that the price  of  gasoline has dropped at a time when it is said the border with  the Dominican Republic is closed to prevent the entry of fuel.  Gasoline vendors in Port-au-Prince explained to Radio Tropic  that they have no difficulties obtaining the fuel because it is  brought across the border at night when there is no surveillance.</p>

			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / International Company News: Czech telecom monopoly advances to Kcs3.49bn SPT Telecom, the Czech state telephone monopoly being restructured and privatised, yesterday reported pre-tax profits of Kcs3.49bn (Dollars 124.6m) for the six months to June on revenues of Kcs10.01bn. Interim figures for 1993 were not made available, but SPT Telecom made full-year pre-tax profits of Kcs6bn on revenues of Kcs18.3bn last year. The company expects full year pre-tax profits for 1994 of Kcs7.4bn. SPT Telecom is seeking a single strategic partner to buy 27 per cent of the company by March 1 next year to help modernise its outdated network. Several international telecoms groups are believed to be interested, with most speculation centred on France Telecom and AT&amp;T of the US. Only one in five Czechs has a telephone, and SPT Telecom has a backlog of more than 500,000 applications for new telephones. The company's future investment programme calls for spending up to Kcs130bn on updating equipment and speeding up installations. Under the government's telecommunications policy, SPT Telecom is to retain a monopoly of Czech telephone services until the end of the decade.</p>

			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Letter: London fails to match Tokyo as a civilised city Sir, May I challenge Mr Colin Amery's statement ('A test for taste and political judgment', February 24) that 'as a civilised city to live in, London certainly scores higher than either New York or Tokyo'. I will concede New York. In the absence of any universally agreed measurement of 'civilised', I suggest that, when applying yardsticks in the arts, science, culture, good government and, not least, the customs and manners of its inhabitants, Tokyo is significantly more civilised than London. With regard to the first three categories (arts, science and culture) not only by definition is Tokyo the most civilised city for its natural inhabitants, the Japanese, but it also provides an ever-broadening array of such activities serving the many constituents of its foreign community. With the last two yardsticks, good government and the customs and manners of its inhabitants, the interests of the local and foreign residents interlock. Government provides a city that functions impeccably and the local inhabitants observe standards of civility and courtesy that are largely unknown in London or in any other city in the world. Avoiding subjectivity, I suggest the most objective data possible on what constitutes 'civilised' is a measurement of its opposite - that is, the occurrence of violence between a city's inhabitants. The comparison between Tokyo and London provides unquestionable proof that a higher level of civilisation prevails in the former.

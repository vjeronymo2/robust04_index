			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: UK economy Perhaps it was lack of incisiveness in the Treasury select committee questions. Perhaps the chancellor remains unexcited by open discussion of economic policy after all. Perhaps the authorities still do not have coherent ideas on policy. Whatever the reason, Mr Lamont's answers yesterday scarcely left the markets any wiser. Without clear economic criteria, short-run policy decisions will probably continue to depend mainly on politics. True, one could read into Mr Lamont's remarks an indication that a rate cut is in the offing. Inflation, he noted, is a lagging indicator. So the fact that the UK is only just inside this particular target may not matter. The chancellor also focused on the exchange rate which has conveniently rallied since last week. Yet there is less immediate political imperative to cut rates now the party conference is over. The authorities may prefer to give the market more time to savour the prospect. After all, they can hardly afford to spark another precipitate fall of sterling by cutting too hastily. One might expect the emphasis on the effective exchange rate index to create a little additional leeway. In fact, since Black Wednesday sterling has fallen by just under 10 per cent against both the D-Mark and in terms of the effective index. So the choice of yardstick has little immediate relevance, and looks designed as a sop to those who want nothing more to do with the ERM. It may narrow the government's freedom of manoeuvre next year, however, if, as many expect, the dollar starts to appreciate significantly against all European currencies.</p>

			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Survey of Turkish Finance and Industry (13): Needlework at the bank - Profile, Bulent Gultekin Building a market economy is harder than people realise,' says Mr Bulent Gultekin, Turkey's new central bank governor. And he should know. As one of the breed of international jet set economists, Mr Gultekin, when not teaching at Wharton School in the US, has spent the last three years advising the Poles, Uzbeks, Kazaks, Ukrainians and Belarussians on how to do it. He is more optimistic about Turkey's prospects however. 'In eastern Europe, you go in a good mood and come out depressed. When you come to Istanbul, even after Vienna, this is a metropolis. It has the same liveliness as Hong Kong, Shanghai, Kuala Lumpur or Jakarta. The lenders and creditors always look at the current account. The institutions, the equity investors, they notice this vibrancy.' Mr Gultekin brings a wealth of experience to the job. A one-time adviser to the World Bank, the EBRD, the United Nations Development Office and the US Agency for International Development, he first came to prominence in Turkey as a pivotal figure in the late Mr Turgut Ozal's economic reforms in the mid-1980s, running the newly created privatisation agency. He remembers drafting a study on the Istanbul stock exchange, when it was still just an idea on Mr Ozal's drawing board. 'Friends in the US thought we were a lot of science fiction writers. Now look at the market,' he says. Turkey, he believes, is at the second stage of reform. 'The first stage was easy. All you needed was a politician of vision, pushing changes through by decree. We are now at the second stage. It requires something more like needlework,' he says. The choice of metaphor might seem appropriate as Mr Gultekin moves to forge a working relationship with Mrs Tansu Ciller, the prime minister - never the easiest of tasks. When appointed, the Turkish press made life briefly uncomfortable, forcing him to renounce his US passport. His wife is an American. The governor was very much a surprise choice to replace the long-serving Mr Rusdu Saracoglu. It was a surprise to him, too. The first his colleagues at Wharton knew of it was from the pages of the Financial Times. 'I was on holiday in Turkey. I'd never met Mrs Ciller before. Within half an hour she'd offered me the job.' When asked if he set any preconditions his reply is loaded: 'I asked her whether she wanted a clerk or a governor.' He faces a difficult job. Mrs Ciller appears intent on bringing down interest rates, in a bid to reduce the government's debt service costs - even if it means renewed pressure on the lira. Since she took over in June, the depreciation of the currency has been accelerated and is now running at around 5 per cent a month compared with around 3 per cent in the first half of 1993. The bank reserves, while healthy at around Dollars 8bn, will need to be sustained to see off any unforeseen volatility. Mr Gultekin is reluctant at this early stage to outline his plans for what he likes to call the banks' bank. But he has already shown his mettle, in the first week in November, successfully intervening to the tune of Dollars 300m to 'stabilise' the currency. Although as a former World Bank adviser, this is not a verb he would use, of course.</p>

			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / International Company News: GM agrees terms to end Daewoo link-up GENERAL Motors, the US vehicle maker, and the Daewoo group of South Korea, have reached final agreement on the terms for GM's withdrawal from Daewoo Motors, the two groups' troubled Korean car manufacturing joint venture. Daewoo said yesterday it had received approval from the South Korean government for its takeover of GM's 50 per cent stake. Three Daewoo units will acquire the GM holding for Dollars 170m with payment spread over three years. Daewoo Electronics will acquire 55 per cent of the GM stake with Daewoo Telecom purchasing 22.8 per cent and Daewoo Heavy Industries 22.2 per cent. Daewoo said the three units would pay 40 per cent of the purchase price this month with payments of 30 per cent in each of the next two years. Relations between the Daewoo Group and GM have been strained for several years. Plans for GM to withdraw first emerged in the second half of 1991, after the US carmaker refused a Daewoo request to inject fresh capital into the venture to expand business and to develop a new model. Honda, the Japanese vehicle maker, is preparing to provide Daewoo with technical support to produce a range of executive cars in Korea. The withdrawal by GM is a setback to its ambitions in the Asia-Pacific region, where it hoped to develop Daewoo Motors as a low-cost production base in Asia.</p>

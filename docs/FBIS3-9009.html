[Drzycimski] Good morning to you, and to you, ladies and  gentlemen.    [Woyciechowski] We know for sure now that on Tuesday [22  March], Prime Minister Pawlak will send the president a motion  concerning the appointment of new Deputy Prime Minister Dariusz  Rosati. What will the president do about the motion? Will he  sign it, or not?    [Drzycimski] You know, I am not sure whether it will happen  on Tuesday -- that is the first thing. The other issue is that  at the point when the president receives the motion, he will  then definitely talk to the prime minister, and he will  deliberate on the issue. But so far, there has been no official  document submitted to the president, nor have there been any  talks that would concern this whole issue in a substantive way.    [Woyciechowski] But it so happens that the entire press is  speculating on the issue. So let me put it this way: Does the  president have any reasons not to sign the nomination?    [Drzycimski] He does not have any reasons but he just has to  take a good look at the man since so far there has been a  candidacy which by the way was talked about by the media, but as  regards the person who is the most concerned here -- that is the  prime minister -- there have been no statements apart from a  general statement that the president is familiar with such a  candidacy. So I think that once the candidacy is officially  presented, then the president will think about ....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Has it happened before that  the president did not sign such a motion for appointment of a  deputy prime minister or a minister?    [Drzycimski] Well, yes, I mean not when it comes to a deputy  prime minister but there was the famous case of the minister of  culture. That happened in the past. The president did not sign  the motion, and that caused a specific political situation. So  when it comes to that, the president will also try to assess  [words indistinct]    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] But do you think he will tend  to sign it, or not? Is he willing to sign it? What is the  situation?    [Drzycimski] You know, I never speak in terms of whether  somebody could probably tend to do this or that since the  decision in this case must be carefully deliberated by the  president and therefore he has to have more information. We  really do not know a lot about Mr. Rosati, I mean Professor  Rosati. He is someone who is getting a lot of publicity  currently from the mass media, he himself is outspoken, he  presents his views. The issue requires a careful approach. The  president never undertakes such things ....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] You mean he never signs  anything immediately but takes some time to think about it?    [Drzycimski] I mean he never does things that have not been  thought through. Sometimes he signs something right away but  then it has been thought through. But when it comes to Mr.  Rosati, we actually do not know much.    [Woyciechowski] And what will he do [words indistinct]    [Drzycimski] This is even more so since Professor Rosati was  abroad for the entire period when the main transformations were  taking place in Poland. And so it is difficult to say right  away whether someone knows his activities. We do not know a lot  about this.    [Woyciechowski] And what about the budget? That is another  document which needs to be signed by the president. And there  are huge speculations going on as to whether he will sign it or  not.    [Drzycimski] That is [hesitating] one of the big problems  created by subsequent governing teams. Parliaments and  governments take quite an easy-going approach to this, and then  they leave it to the president to make the final decision, and  they are positive that he will make a judicious decision, and so  forth. I must say that the budget is ....[Drzycimski pauses]  Generally speaking, a situation of social tension has been  created about the state budget, since the whole election  campaign in September was under slogans like: It Doesn't Have  To Be That Way, It Shouldn't Be That Way, The Budget Must Be  Changed, in other words that the budget be pro- social. All  these are election slogans. And in practical terms, the budget  -- presented to the parliament and going through subsequent  stages there -- has not changed much apart from a few minor  revisions, in comparison with what the previous governments had  established and worked out regarding the entire concept. So one  can say that all these enormous social hopes that had been  aroused, were not reflected in the budget.    [Woyciechowski] You mean the budget is not a fulfillment  of election promises?    [Drzycimski] Yes. And so the president is asking the  question: What is the situation? Are society's hopes to be  frustrated once again? Is the issue to be approached  light-heartedly again, something along the lines of election  promises and their implementation by a specific political  coalition? That is why this is a difficult problem for the  president since he has to view it from two perspectives: In  political terms, I mean in terms that society had a right to  expect because society had been presented with a change of a  certain economic concept, and that change was not implemented in  practice. The president's other problem -- I mean sort of in  reverse -- is that the president is familiar with the state of  the country and its budget, and he knows that when it comes to  this budget, one cannot make many radical moves, as it were.  That is a dilemma for a politician who must make difficult  decisions, and they are difficult also for him.    [Woyciechowski] But that is a moral dilemma. What would  happen politically speaking if the president refused to sign the  budget? What are the consequences of [words indistinct]    [Drzycimski] The consequences are that the budget goes back  to the parliament, and then it can be voted through again, and  then once there are two-thirds of the votes, then the president  must sign it. There were such cases in the past where the  president vetoed a law and it went back to the parliament, and  that proves that the president pays attention ....[pauses] Let  me remind you that the problem of Electoral Law for instance was  vetoed by the president and there was a big debate whether he  can do it or not. The law was voted through anyway, and one must  pay attention to how this influences the current situation, with  this kind of political configuration.    [Woyciechowski] About Prime Minister Pawlak's Moscow visit.  Is the president still surprised, and is he happy with the  outcome of the visit? Has the prime minister presented a report  yet?    [Drzycimski] I mean, as far as I know, the prime minister  has not paid a visit to the president as yet. I mean, I know  for sure that he has not seen him, but whether he has called him  on the telephone -- as far as I know, he has not done so yet,  unless he did it very recently, but as far as late last night is  concerned, that did not happen.    The president was surprised by something else -- I mean  generally he was aware of the visit -- but he was surprised that  the prime minister failed to report to him personally on what  the situation is, I mean in terms of the goal of the visit.  When the prime minister goes on a foreign trip, political  issues always come to the surface, and that is why the president  stressed that when it comes to the supreme state agencies, there  should be large-scale coordination. In every case concerning  foreign policy, he has always consulted with Minister  Skubiszewski -- it has never happened otherwise. And right now,  he does the same with Minister Olechowski since the president  thinks that of course he bears the constitutional responsibility  for the general strategy as president, but when it comes to  practical implementation, there is a specialized governmental  agency to do that -- that is the Foreign Ministry which carries  out the implementation. So the ministry knows about what is the  best solution in terms of political configurations, timing, and  selection of countries. That is very much observed by the  president.    [Woyciechowski] Mr. Prime Minister -- I am sorry: Mr.  Minister -- why did the prime minister not conduct any  consultations? Did he just forget? Or did he rebel?    [Drzycimski] No, no, that was simply regarded a bit like  ....[pauses] Anyway, that was cleared up quickly.    [Woyciechowski] So he forgot?    [Drzycimski] It was regarded as something to be taken for  granted. There is the ministry, and it transferred [sentence as  heard]. But the president expects that in such situations, some  mutual consultations be conducted, and this is even more so  since the president always invites government representatives to  participate in his every trip. I emphasize that he does not  have to do that.    [Woyciechowski] The prime minister did not invite  representatives of the president's office...    [Drzycimski, interrupting] No, that is not the problem. All  I am saying is that the president wants everything that he takes  care of in the state to be handled by specific ministries,  specific ministers. They take, as it were, specific issues into  their own hands and decide whether these or those solutions can  be achieved. As a rule, the economic ministers are invited, but  not only. In Ukraine, for example, the culture minister  participated in the visit. It all depends on the character of  the visit. However, the president always assumes that it is  very good when there is close rapport between the president and  the government, when there is no misunderstanding. The  president believes that the government should see what the  president discussed, which issues were tackled. Let us take the  recent visit to India, for instance. The visit was rather  scantily discussed by the Polish mass media; however, I must say  that on that Indian subcontinent it really hit the headlines,  both on television and in the press. During that visit the  president was accompanied by three ministers: foreign affairs  minister, industry minister, and foreign economic cooperation  minister. Participating in the visit was also a group of ten  entrepreneurs who represented the greatest commercial, economic  centers which want to enter the Indian market, or which are  already operating there. You know, there is an awareness that  this is all conducted as a joint activity.    [Woyciechowski] Mr. Minister, how does the Belvedere  evaluate the Moscow trip? Was it just a minor incident or have  relations with Prime Minister Pawlak, which have so far been  excellent, begun to deteriorate?    [Drzycimski] Do we think so?    [Woyciechowski] Yes.    [Drzycimski] No, certainly not.    [Woyciechowski] It was just a minor thing, was it not?    [Drzycimski] It was a technical issue, all the more so  because, as I said, during the visit that the prime minister  paid to the president a day before his departure, these issues  were...    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] They were explained?    [Drzycimski] Yes, they were explained. In addition, the  prime minister presented very detailed main points of the visit;  this was very important, because the prime minister decided that  the visit and the talks should supplement the presidential  agreements with specifics. This is what we really need:  openness is everywhere, but we should get deeper into things,  especially into the economic issues. I hear that a lot has been  achieved in this area. I believe this will be a very important  visit as it may open the Russian market.    [Woyciechowski] Mr. Minister, have you already read the  68-page report by the National Council of Radio and Television?    [Drzycimski] No, I have not. This report is currently on  the president's desk. I saw him going through it rather  thoroughly.    [Woyciechowski] What will become of the council? What do  you think?    [Drzycimski] The president delicately presented his stand.  He presented his own remarks and concerns. As president, who  feels responsible for what is happening in the country -- also  responsible for the democratic transformations in the mass media  -- he stated his views. He believed that certain decisions had  been made too hastily; he did make that clear. It also seems  that these issues will sooner or later be brought up again and  again: Free mass media, free press, free radio, and free  television. I believe that these issues will be brought up,  that all the issues of social concern will be presented. The  president had information which needed to be thought over. I do  not...    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] He recalled Markiewicz. Is he  still certain that he had the right to do that?    [Drzycimski] Did he have the right?    [Woyciechowski] Yes.    [Drzycimski] This is one of the loopholes of the law, and  the president brought the issue up -- he realized that the issue  would come up sooner or later. He thought that this problem had  to be resolved, so that future actions could be taken within a  specified legal framework. It was a loophole; the president  showed that; and now we are quietly waiting for the  Constitutional Tribunal to make a decision. At any rate,  generally the president believes that, whenever he has any  doubts, he feels he must speak out. He has done so in many  other cases, in many far more difficult cases. He has some  doubts, his conscience compels him to present it all. Now,  whether this will prove itself remains an open issue. He did  signal the problem, he did bring it up at a moment when  decisions were being made too hastily; he decided to recall the  chairman because he believed that the issues needed to be  examined quietly -- all the more so because, according to the  president, the decisions were in great conflict with the Law on  Radio and Television, which clearly states that one broadcaster  cannot achieve a dominating position; however, it seemed that  there was such a dominating position, because if one broadcaster  receives both the satellite... [pauses] The nationwide  television and regional stations, then, well, there is not much  left for others.    [Woyciechowski] Mr. Minister, today and yesterday the  issue of those three presidential deputy ministers started to be  discussed again. Today's papers carry reports that most  probably Mr. Siemiatkowski will very soon be appointed deputy  minister of national defense. Can you confirm that? Is this...    [Drzycimski, interrupting] This is definitely an issue...  [pauses] Generally, I want to recall, and I have already said  that the president believes that if a minister is entrusted with  the function of steering a ministry, then...    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Then the minister selects his  cooperators himself.    [Drzycimski] Then the minister selects his cooperators  himself. Such positions cannot be filled in line with the  so-called political-party system. That is one point. Second,  if the ministries need to be strengthened, it is decided by the  minister, who makes his decisions after examining not their past  membership, but their professional skills and expertise. The  president will always defend decisions made independently by  ministers, not made under political pressure.    [Woyciechowski] In other words, we should not expect any  important decisions today or tomorrow on the issue?    [Drzycimski, interrupting] I do not have any information on  that.    [Woyciechowski] Another piece of information from today's  press: The candidate of the Democratic Left Alliance for the  post of deputy minister of internal affairs is Mr. Zbigniew  Sobotko, or Sobotka, and Minister Milczanowski has not yet  discussed that with the Belvedere. Do you know anything about  that...    [Drzycimski, interrupting] This falls under the same rule; I  am speaking now about the rule, not about persons. If the  ministers decide that these are persons who are professionally  able to...    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Then the president will not  object to that.    [Drzycimski] No, he will not. The president believes that  it is an issue of decisions; however, he will keep stressing  that the decisions are up to the ministers, who do not have to  yield to political pressure.    [Woyciechowski] Mr. Minister, let us now briefly discuss the  strikes. The Solidarity strikes. Today at 0830 [0730 GMT]  Solidarity will begin picketing in front of the Sejm. Tomorrow  Solidarity will hold talks with Prime Minister Pawlak. How do  you evaluate the strike situation?    [Drzycimski] Well, we partly discussed that while talking  about the budget. People had a right to expect certain things.  That is their way of expressing concern, which will grow deeper.  Therefore, both the government and Solidarity must attempt to  find some solution. People's expectations were increased and so  they must ask the question. Now, here is another, very  important remark. The trade union role is to exert pressure;  however, they must also remember that there is a certain limit  that cannot be exceeded. Many years ago the president said that  trade unions, in this case Solidarity, are just like good  bacteria on a living organism: They are parasites, quote  unquote; however, they must remember that they cannot destroy  the organism they live in. That is, trade unions must put  pressure, fight, keep reminding, submit demands, and so on.  Those are their inalienable rights; it is the most fundamental  right, which must be implemented. However, trade unions must  also remember that there is a certain limit, which is called the  condition of the state. That limit is hard to exceed.  Therefore, it is important that union people and government  representatives sit at the negotiation table jointly, so that a  discussion can be conducted over what can be done and to what  extent. It seems that the resolution of the problem is going in  that direction. Nevertheless, I would like to stress very  strongly that it has been caused by the election campaign, where  something entirely different was promised and the people are  entitled to make demands.    [Woyciechowski] Thank you very much for the interview.    [Drzycimski] Thank you.</p>

			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Postal workers vote on shifts deal STRIKING POSTAL workers in Cardiff will vote today on whether to end the dispute which has disrupted mail in the Welsh capital for a fortnight. Officials of the Union of Communication Workers yesterday told a meeting of the 900 postal workers of a framework agreement which was negotiated last week between the union and Royal Mail. But the ballot on calling off the strike was postponed until today. The ballot will carry a recommendation from both national and branch officials to accept the agreement. Mr Steve Bell, Cardiff branch secretary of the Union of Communication Workers, said after yesterday's meeting: 'Branch officers believe that the agreement represents a substantial concession - a victory for the workforce. However, the workforce will make the final decision itself. 'Whatever the decision is, we have demonstrated that attempts by an unaccountable management to impose antisocial working patterns upon the Cardiff workforce have been defeated.' Mr Alun Michael, Labour MP for Cardiff South and Penarth, yesterday called for an independent inquiry into Royal Mail's management structure and style, which he said had prolonged the dispute. He said it was 'crazy' that the letter service in Cardiff was now managed from a regional office in Gloucester. 'We have this remote control management which seems calculated to reduce confidence both on the part of employees, with whom communication is of the essence, and also with the public,' he said. 'Negotiations are always best left to the two sides but when it is the business community and the public generally that are being damaged then we have a right to say 'how are people running this outfit?'.' Mr Graham Hall, chief executive of the Wales Chamber of Commerce, said last night: 'There is an increasing feeling of frustration, particularly at the way a settlement has been delayed. 'I am not sure people are aware of how serious it is. Everyone can identify the cashflow problem - the money flow in Cardiff is drying up. But the longer-term effect that people don't realise will be the lost orders because inquiries have not been answered.' It is expected to take at least a week for the backlog of 1m items of mail to be cleared if the strike is called off today.</p>

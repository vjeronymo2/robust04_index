			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / UN Security Council warns Iraq against border violations THE United Nations Security Council yesterday expressed concern at recent criticism by Iraq of the work of a UN commission which demarcated the Kuwait-Iraq border, Reuter reports from New York. The Council warned Baghdad of the 'serious consequences' of any violation of the boundary. The commission did not reallocate territory between Kuwait and Iraq but demarcated a boundary agreed by them in October 1963.</p>

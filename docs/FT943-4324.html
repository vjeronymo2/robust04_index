			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Target may be company profits Sir, Your reporting of Jonathan Aitken's interview omitted a significant point ('Aitken targets housing benefit', September 6). Commenting on economic recovery, the Treasury chief secretary referred to company profits increasing and said '. . . these should be being used for new investment and new jobs'. The italics, as far as they can be determined in a radio interview, are Mr Aitken's. Those investors, whether tax-exempt or otherwise, who depend on a flow of company dividends to meet their commitments, would do well to reflect on this remark and its implications for government policy on taxation and dividends.

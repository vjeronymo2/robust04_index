			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / People: Brian Walsh moves from GKN to TI TI Group chairman Sir Christopher Lewinton has put the finishing touches to his new generation of managers with the hiring of Brian Walsh, GKN's finance director, to replace TI's own Michael Garner, who has been in the job for 14 years and wants a change. Garner, 55, already a member of the Accounting Standards Board, will play a larger role within that organisation. 'Michael pointed out to me that he had served seven years in two administrations and that he wanted to make a change, but within TI if possible. This gave me the opportunity to bring in a younger man, fitting in with the heads of the three operating divisions, who are all in their late 40s or early 50s,' Lewinton said yesterday. The most recent recruit was Tony Edwards, formerly of Lucas, to head the Dowty division at TI. As well as being the right age, TI also believes he understands the marketing business - very important to the Lewinton culture - having worked at two consumer goods companies. At Singer he was vice-president and director of finance and business planning between 1980 and 1982 and he then moved to General Foods, initially as assistant corporate controller and treasurer, and subsequently as finance director of the US grocery business. These five years in the US were also important in his selection, says Lewinton, who explains that 40 per cent of TI's business is in America. City analysts, meanwhile, give Walsh high marks for his near six year spell at GKN, where he identified earlier than some of his peers the onset of recession and initiated tough cost-cutting measures. Meanwhile, TI is looking forward to Garner, who remains an executive director, involving himself in a range of accounting issues of direct relevance to TI such as ACT, and the introduction of FRS3. 'One of the problems of this country is that everyone stands in their separate corners - industry, government, the treasury,' complains Lewinton. Under his stewardship, Mark Radcliffe was seconded from TI to set up the National Manufacturing Council at the CBI. ASB chairman David Tweedie adds that with only two full-time members out of the nine board representatives, his operation is under-resourced  - in contrast, for instance, to the American counterpart FASB which has seven full-time members. He sees Garner developing the contacts with industry for which he himself has insufficient time.</p>

			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Trafalgar to change accounting policy TRAFALGAR HOUSE, the property, construction and engineering group under siege from Hongkong Land, is expected to change its accounting policies following an investigation by the Financial Reporting Review Panel, the new accounting standards watchdog. The outcome of the panel's investigation, which started in February, is also likely to have a significant effect on Trafalgar's results for the financial year to September 30, 1992. The move centres on Pounds 102.7m worth of development properties Trafalgar reclassified in 1991 as fixed assets, resulting in a Pounds 68m writedown of wholly-owned properties and a Pounds 34.7m writedown of associates. If the writedowns had been deducted from the profit and loss account, as the panel is understood to have argued, they would have reduced last year's Pounds 122.4m pre-tax profits. Sir Eric Parker, Trafalgar's chief executive, said: 'The group's accounts were the responsibility of the board which have acted with the very best advice from our financial advisers. The accounts were unqualified by our auditor, Touche Ross.' He added: 'There are different views within the accounting profession as to how deal with things.' Trafalgar said the panel was already looking at the accounts of another 200 companies and dismissed the incident as having little effect in its fight to prevent Hongkong Land, which has already acquired 14.99 per cent of the group, from taking another 15 per cent by tender this week. However the panel, which is expected to make an announcement today, says it is investigating the accounts of fewer than 20 companies. Trafalgar is understood to have accepted the ruling of the panel - to transfer the development properties back into current assets - to avoid going to the High Court, which could have compelled the group to revise its accounts. Trafalgar will give details of the expected amendments to its accounting practices and policies in a circular to be sent to institutional shareholders tomorrow. Sir Eric, who was yesterday working on the final details of the circular with senior directors at Trafalgar's London headquarters, said he would try to reassure shareholders that the panel's ruling would not have any effect on the value of Trafalgar's businesses. Shareholders' funds at the year-end are expected to remain unchanged at Pounds 704.6m. However this year's pre-tax profits are expected to be further dented by new writedowns. The board still intends to pay a final dividend although it is expected to be severely cut from last year's 9.6p. Trafalgar said Kleinwort Benson, one of its financial advisers, is marketing its hotels, which include the Ritz and the Stafford and are valued at Pounds 130m by Trafalgar, to around 30 potential buyers.

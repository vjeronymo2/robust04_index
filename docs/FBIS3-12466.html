			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with PLO Executive Committee Member Mahmud </F> 'Abbas, also identified by his nom de guerre Abu-Mazin, by  Rashid Khashanah in Tunis; date not given]    [Text] [Khashanah] There are mounting Palestinian calls  for the suspension of the PLO's participation in the  negotiations in protest against the Hebron massacre. What are  the expected repercussions of the massacre for the negotiations  and the peace process?    ['Abbas] What the Israeli settlers have done is a major  obstacle in the way of the peace process and reflects the wishes  and views of those settlers who rejected the peace process from  the beginning out of the belief that it endangers their own  interests. They see it undermining their beliefs and the  illusions they entertained for decades about "greater Israel."  That is why, since the signing of the Declaration of Principles  agreement and the start of the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations,  they have been provoking the Palestinian population and, in  doing so, taking advantage of the privileges they got from the  Israeli Government, namely full armament and freedom of movement  in the West Bank and the Gaza strip while the Palestinians are  forbidden to carry arms and are faced with curfews and movement  restrictions.    The settlers, enjoying all these freedoms and privileges, of  course reject the peace process. That hostile action will have  an impact on the Palestinian people.    As a matter of principle, we have to say that there has been  no crime such as that abominable crime committed by those  settlers for many years. It (the Hebron massacre) is of the  same magnitude as the Kafr Qasim, Qibyah, and Dayr Yasin  massacres, and other massacres committed by the Zionist gangs in  the past, crimes now committed and carried out by the settlers  militias.    We must here hold the Israeli Government responsible because  it gave the settler these liberties and because it has special  militias.    I do not know why a government which has an army, a police  force, and security forces needs militias to "protect" those  settlers. If it believes that their presence is abnormal, why  keep them where they are? Furthermore, why have settlements  which have been deemed unnecessary by the United Nations, the  whole world, and a large number of Israelis?    When (Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq) Rabin himself speaks  of  political settlements and security settlements, he means to say  that some of these settlements are unnecessary. We do not  believe that the solution to this problem is to be found in the  statements and resolutions of condemnation nor in the messages  of condolences sent by the Israeli officials. The solution lies  in effective measures to disarm the settlers and reassess many  settlements which present daily provocations and cause direct  friction between the Palestinian and Israeli people, until such  a time when settlement as a whole would end, for, in our view,  it was unnecessary to begin with.    [Khashanah] Do you believe that the revival of the  intifadah, with the old thrust and even more strongly, would  weaken the negotiation trend or strengthen the position of the  Palestinian negotiators?    ['Abbas] The intifadah was initiated against the occupation  and it will continue as long as the occupation continues, and it  will grow day after day whenever massacres such as the Hebron  al-Ibrahimi mosque massacre are committed and as long as other  tragedies befall the Palestinian people. It is an expression of  the Palestinian people's determination to end the occupation.    If the Israeli Government wants to coexist with the  Palestinians, it must eliminate all the causes of friction and  provocation which are real obstacles and barriers in the way of  the peace process.    [Khashanah] Will the Palestinian suspension of the  negotiations continue until the PLO's request for disarmament of  the settlers and freezing of the settlements is granted?    ['Abbas] We have summoned the heads of the Palestinian  negotiating delegations to leadership headquarters in Tunis for  consultation on the measures to be taken in the wake of that  massacre.    [Khashanah] Will a Palestinian delegation go to Washington  in response to President Clinton's invitation addressed to the  PLO and Israel?    ['Abbas] In principle, I see no objection to acceptance of  the invitation, but before the (Palestinian) leadership says yes  or no, we must have answers to many important inquiries handed  by brother Abu-'Ammar ['Arafat] to the U.S. ambassador in Tunis.    [Khashanah] Such as?    ['Abbas] The purpose of moving the negotiations to  Washington, the level of the delegations to the negotiations,  and other matters.    [Khashanah] Have you noticed that the number of Palestinians  killed under this current Labor government is more than the  number of those killed under Likud? That casts heavy shadows on  the declared peaceful intentions of the ruling Labor Party.    ['Abbas] If we look at the general historical course of  events and examine the Arab-Israeli conflict developments, we  would notice that the Labor Party controlled the Jewish Agency  in the early days and it still does, and it was the Labor Party  which founded the state of Israel and fought the 1956, 1967, and  1973 wars against the Arabs. It was also the Labor Party which  started the settlements, killed the fedayeen and crush their  bones in full view of the whole world. But we are dealing with  a state and an institution which, if it differs under different  governments on some issues, is always in agreement on many other  issues.</p>

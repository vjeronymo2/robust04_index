			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["U.S. Nuclear Submarines Extend Espionage Against DPRK" -- </F> KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, June 22 (KCNA) -- U.S. nuclear submarines  are reportedly extending espionage near the coast of Korea these  days.    The number of calls of U.S. nuclear submarines at ports on  the west coast of Japan last year jumped remarkably. The  submarines called at the White Beach Base of the U.S. Navy in  Okinawa on 17 occasions at maximum and frequent the Sasebo Base  in Nagasaki prefecture and the Yokosuka Port.    The brisk activities of U.S. nuclear submarines are related  to the expanded scope of the the U.S. naval espionage against  the DPRK, said ITAR-TASS June 20.    The news agency said U.S. nuclear submarines navigating  along  the shores of the DPRK are specialised in collection of  information about the communications network of the Armed Forces  of the DPRK and every possible eavesdropping of radio  communications.    U.S. nuclear submarines enter Sasebo Port of Japan but stay  on the waters off the harbour for more than an hour, not  anchoring at the wharf, in order to hand over information,  experts say.    The activation of the espionage of U.S. nuclear submarines  near the coast of the DPRK coincides with the intensification of  the U.S. hostile campaign to stifle the DPRK.</p>

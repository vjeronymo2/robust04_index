			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Philips faces its moment of truth: The company's emphasis on consumer electronics When Mr Jan Timmer, president of Philips, unveils last year's results on Thursday, he will highlight the group's shift in emphasis towards consumer electronics and reveal to what extent it has recovered from the black year of 1990. That year, which saw record losses of Fl 4.24bn (Pounds 1.3bn), prompted an ambitious restructuring: non-core businesses have been disposed of and the company's technological strengths have been brought to bear on new consumer products. This week's news is expected to show that, while the company made a small profit last year, the revival has largely been the result of cost-cutting rather than success in new products, many of which are still in the planning stage. The group's assessment of how it fared in its year of reckoning is of interest not only to investors worried about its financial health. As one of the few remaining diversified European electrical and electronics companies, Philips is a champion of a cause - the maintenance of an independent European capability in electronic technologies. As such, its ability to turn its financial fortunes around will have consequences extending far beyond the boundaries of the group's home town of Eindhoven, in the Netherlands. It will also show whether Europe will be able to maintain electronics concerns that can compete globally. A year ago, Mr Timmer made a resounding pronouncement about shaking the group back into competitiveness and returning it to long-term profitability. In the first nine months of 1991, 24,200 jobs - about 9 per cent of the total - were cut. Changes in top management, including the replacement of the head of the consumer electronics division, have been implemented. The aim of his corporate strategy, as gleaned by the divestments and investments he has made since becoming president nearly two years ago, has been to bolster the predominance of consumer electronics in the group's businesses. Last year, Philips disposed of its loss-making information systems division; sold off its remaining stake in Whirlpool International, its white goods business; and pulled out of its telecommunications joint venture with AT&amp;T. The moves were welcomed as indicating a new-found willingness to take tough decisions. The picture that emerges is of a group in which the technology-driven strategy that made Philips, the great innovator, a loser on the high street, is being replaced by a more market-driven initiative. The central element of this strategy, the focus on consumer electronics, is hardly surprising. The division represents nearly half the group's revenues, accounting for 45 per cent of total revenues of Fl 55.8bn in 1990. What is new, however, is the greater emphasis on software, such as music recordings and videos, and expansion of the group's distribution network. This strategy clearly emerges in Mr Timmer's most eye-catching investments. This month, he agreed to spend Dollars 175m on a 25 per cent stake in Whittle Communications, the US media company - a step towards a 33 per cent holding. Philips sees Whittle as a vehicle for promoting one of its latest products, Compact Disc-Interactive (CD-I), a CD player which, when hooked to a television set, allows the viewer to combine sound, image and graphics. Whittle already enjoys unusual access to US schoolchildren - a prime potential market for CD-I's educational applications - through its 12-minute news programme called Channel One, which it beams to nearly 9,000 US high schools (partly with the help of Philips equipment) every day. The US investment is part of Philips' wider efforts to ensure not only that consumers have the necessary software to run on their Philips hardware, but also that the company will be in a position to control the outlets for that software. To this end, Mr Timmer has concentrated the group's relatively scarce resources in building up a network of interests in the video-rental business in continental Europe, the UK and the US. This emphasis has been controversial, partly because Philips was itself making losses in video rental and was forced to rescue Super Club, the loss-making Belgian chain in which it had a stake. But this web of interests in video rental will give it access to thousands of 'software' outlets in north America and north-west Europe, which it hopes to use to promote new "hardware' like CD-I. Philips increasingly sees software as a valuable activity in its own right, both as a source of dependable profits and a counter-weight to consumer hardware price wars. Although Philips does not break down profits by product group, its 80 per cent stake in PolyGram, the London-based music company, has in recent years been a main source of profits in consumer products. It now evidently assumes that having influence over the software played on its video-cassette recorders and televisions will be equally lucrative: it frequently cites 1989 figures from the US showing that consumers spent Dollars 9.5bn on video software that year, Dollars 500m more than they spent on TV sets. But while Philips's new market-driven strategy marks a bold departure, the impact has yet to be felt on the company's profits. The group's performance in 1991, its centenary year, is expected to show that, while Mr Timmer and his management team have made some progress, there is still a long way to go. Recession in many of its principal markets and the difficulties in changing attitudes in the company's large bureaucracy have slowed the benefits of restructuring. An unexpectedly strong swing back into profitability in the first three quarters of last year has raised hopes. A loss of Fl 2.2bn in the third quarter of 1990, for example, was transformed into profits of Fl 188m in the same period in 1991. But a careful scrutiny of the numbers indicates that the improvement is due largely to the benefits of having taken out a big slice of costs in the form of staff cuts. The costs of the restructuring were taken as provisions against profits in 1990 - an important factor in the group's losses that year. More worrying, profits in the consumer electronics division, which comprise more than 40 per cent of group revenue, have been slipping steadily throughout the year as increased competition in a recessionary environment has eaten into margins. In spite of the cost reductions achieved so far, the group is still highly indebted and financing costs last year are expected to be as high as 50 per cent of operating profits. This level of financing costs is crippling at a time when new products, such as CD-I and high definition television, still require large investments. HDTV investment is likely to cost several hundred million guilders. Unless financing costs can be brought down, they will have a lasting impact not only on profitability over the next few years but also on the company's ability to stay ahead in product innovation, says Mr Peter Knox, electronics analyst at stockbroker UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. With shareholders increasingly vocal in their criticism of Philips' management, the company can no longer afford to take such a long-term view of its investment in product development, admits one Philips official. The combination of the group's financial pressures and the need to placate shareholders means that Mr Timmer will need to perform a careful balancing act when he declares the company's dividend policy in two days' time. If analysts are right and Philips fixes the 1991 dividend at about Fl 0.50 compared with its last pay-out of Fl 2 in 1989, the message to staff and to investors will be clear: some progress has been made but a lot needs to be done. The real test will come in the next two to three years. This will be 'own-up time' for the group, as one spokesman for the company puts it. During the period, at least one of the technologies that Philips has been pouring money into - DCC, wide screen TV and CD-I - must reap profits. Unless the group can deliver in that time, Philips could return to the gloom of 1990. It would then have to face a much more radical shake-up than Mr Timmer's current exercise.  -------------------------------------------------------------- STRUGGLE TO STAY ABOVE WATER  --------------------------------------------------------------                         ---------------Sales-------------                            1990                         Guilder bn     Q1      Q2      Q3  -------------------------------------------------------------- Lighting                    7.03     1.75    1.80    1.75 Consumer Products           25.40    5.71    5.84    6.33 Profesional                 13.06    2.60    3.22    3.02 products and systems Components                   8.16    1.99    2.15    1.94 Miscellaneous                2.12    0.46    0.47    0.45 Income not attributable to a specific product sector  -------------------------------------------------------------- Total                       55.76   12.51   13.49   13.49  --------------------------------------------------------------  --------------------------------------------------------------                       ------------------Income-----------                             1990                       Guilder million  Q1      Q2      Q3  -------------------------------------------------------------- Lighting                     419      135     126     109 Consumer Products          1,172      298     191     180 Profesional                   18       70     181     109 products and systems Components                   -11       65     166     120 Miscellaneous                144       16      42     -10 Income not attributable to   -22       71     -27     -39 a specific product sector  -------------------------------------------------------------- Total                      2,260      655     679     469  --------------------------------------------------------------</p>

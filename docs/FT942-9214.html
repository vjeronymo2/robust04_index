			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Quality streets find ready buyers - The advantages of acquiring good mortgage books Potential home buyers complaining that many properties on the market are poor quality and that the good ones are snapped up quickly at rising prices as buyers compete, may find it comforting to know that mortgage lenders themselves are in the same position. The properties in question are mortgage books rather than houses, but the market conditions are not dissimilar. For the last few years, interest among lenders in this low-profile form of acquisition has been increasing, and competition has become intense. 'A couple of years ago, it might be that two lenders looked at a book that was for sale,' one senior executive said, 'now, 15 might see it'. Even among centralised lenders, who are usually cast as those seeking to leave the market, there is some interest in acquiring mortgage books. National Home Loans, for example, is looking to buy. None of the purchases has so far matched in size the Pounds 1.8bn offered by Lloyds Bank for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society. However, the sums involved can still be substantial and are rarely insignificant. Few lenders would look at a book worth less than Pounds 10m, and for the larger organisations Pounds 20m may be the lower limit, which makes the process of carrying out due diligence worthwhile. Halifax Building Society has built up mortgage book acquisitions totalling about Pounds 1bn over the past three to four years. In February this year Abbey National bought the Pounds 900m UK residential mortgage book of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. Birmingham Midshires, one of the smaller building societies active in this area, made acquisitions amounting to almost Pounds 250m in 1993. Such activity highlights the contrast with the books that have failed to find a buyer. 'There are a lot of poor quality loan portfolios out there,' commented one lender. Nothing came, for example, of giving potential purchasers the opportunity to show interest in the Pounds 2bn mortgage book of Mortgage Express, the centralised lender owned by the TSB. Some potential buyers were deterred by the quality of the loans. TSB says now that it is committed to keeping the operation and managing down the loan book. Similarly some of the mortgage books available from foreign banks have not proved attractive. These banks entered the UK housing market in the mid- to late-1980s, stopped lending in the recession and now want to leave an area of non-core business. Much more attractive have been the the staff mortgage books of some large financial institutions. Even the Bank of England has sold its staff mortgage book to the Halifax, which has specialised in this type of purchase. Mr Peter Walsh, finance director of Chelsea Building Society, said that in buying a mortgage book a lender was taking on business where there was a track record of payments giving more information than may be obtained from vetting a new borrower. While it is hard to imagine what could be safer than taking on the Bank of England staff mortgage book, this lack of risk highlights only some of the advantages that a purchaser can gain from buying a book of the right quality. Mr John Fry, group services director at Abbey National, said that buying the CIBC book was 'a way of increasing our assets without putting margins under pressure'. The purchase also gave Abbey an additional 17,500 mortgage customers who were 'pleased to come to a household name', as well as a facility that will enable them to securitise future mortgages. Abbey gave former CIBC borrowers a 0.25 percentage point interest rate cut, but they are still paying about 0.5 percentage points more than Abbey customers generally. Mr Stuart Bernau, a senior executive at Nationwide Building Society, commented that even when different interest rates paid were harmonised, there was still a benefit in acquiring such loans. Against the background of the recent emphasis on fixed-rate mortgage lending, where margins are generally narrower, the opportunity to buy a significant amount of variable rate lending is particularly attractive. Compared with merger or the purchase of another organisation, buying a mortgage book can also offer growth without tears. The transaction does not require, for example, the consent of a society's members, and the legal status of the process is not in doubt. It is also much less likely to lead to large scale job losses or redundancies than having to reconcile two branch networks into a single organisation. Though lenders believe the intensified competition for mortgage books will continue for some time, despite the impact it has already had in raising prices, they know that whatever its benefits, buying mortgage books can only be a sideline compared with selling mortgages. 'It's a useful addition, but it's not going to change the way we do business,' concluded Mr Dick Spelman, marketing general manager at the Halifax.</p>

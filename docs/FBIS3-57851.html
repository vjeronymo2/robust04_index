			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Sian Clare, PRESS ASSOCIATION lobby correspondent] </F>   [Excerpts] Britain today gave the Sudanese ambassador 14  days to leave the country in response to Sudan's refusal to  reconsider its decision to expel Britain's man in Khartoum. The  Foreign Office said its order for ambassador Muhammad 'Uthman  Yasin to go was the "inevitable consequence" of Sudan's sticking  by its expulsion of British envoy Peter Streams.    Britain would not agree to the appointment of a successor to  Mr Yasin and there were no plans to choose a replacement for Mr  Streams. Sudan's decision to expel Mr Streams was sparked by  the Archbishop of Canterbury's visit to mainly Christian areas  in the rebel-controlled south of the country.    Today's response by the British Government followed a  meeting  between junior Foreign Office Minister Mark Lennox-Boyd and the  Sudanese Charge d'Affaires Abdurrahman Bakhit who was summoned  this morning. In a 15-minute showdown, Mr Lennox-Boyd asked the  Sudanese to reconsider their decision to expel Mr Streams, but  Mr Bakhit said his government had not altered its position.    A Foreign Office spokesman said: "Mr Lennox-Boyd said this  was a matter of considerable regret and disappointment. Under  the circumstances and in light of the wholly inadequate  explanation which the Sudanese had given for Mr Streams's  expulsion we decided to request the withdrawal of the Sudanese  ambassador, Mr Muhammad 'Uthman Yasin. Mr Yasin has 14 days  within which to leave the country."    Mr Lennox-Boyd had concluded that the expulsion of Mr Yasin  was the "inevitable consequence of the Sudanese government's  action," said the spokesman. But he added: "The British  Government did not want, however, to see the situation  deteriorate further." [passage omitted]    Britain had given Sudan until today to reverse its decision  to expel Mr Streams. But Abdullahi al-Azret, of Sudan's  embassy in Kenya, said today that the ambassador's expulsion  "will not be reconsidered by Khartoum as the presence of such a  man in Khartoum cannot help our bilateral relations."    Khartoum's move had followed Dr Carey's refusal to go to the  east African state as a guest of its government, saying it would  have restricted his freedom of movement. [passage omitted]</p>

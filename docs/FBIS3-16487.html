			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ivan Vorotynskyy: "Minister Radetskyy Is at the </F> Crossroads: Should We Go to NATO or to the Bath House?"]    [Text] Speaking at the flag-raising ceremony for the  antisubmarine ship "Lutsk" in Sevastopol, Ukrainian Defense  Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy said: "The Ukrainian Armed Forces are  equipped well enough to be an equal partner with NATO." Jumping  on the bandwagon has become a habit of the minister. Well, more  power to him. However, there is more wind in the pockets than  in the sails.    Studying the reconstruction potential of the Armed Forces  from the small Czech Republic, independent Western experts  concluded that even if 80 percent of the military budget was  spent on this purpose, the restructuring would require at least  12 years. Polish specialists estimated that to reach the  armament level of the German and U.S. Armies, the Polish Army  would have to receive 10 percent of the state budget for 20  years.    For Ukraine, NATO is also an example of how to resolve the  problem of unification of weapons and military equipment. The  huge military industrial complex in Ukraine needs to be phased  out because its production used to be oriented toward former  Warsaw Pact countries. A new complex will take decades and huge  expenses to establish. Let alone the fact that Ukraine has a  range of military plants (the Lvov Radio and Television  Equipment Amalgamation, the Dniepropetrovsk Rocket Plant, and  Mariupol Ship Yard), whose products are even better than their  NATO equivalents, such as the T80-M tank manufactured in  Kharkov. Besides, Ukraine risks losing its niche on the arms  market, which presently brings substantial profits to the state  treasury. The "Partnership for Peace" has its social aspect in  Ukraine as millions of people employed in the defense industry  will be thrown out onto the street.    It does not take a military expert to understand that  achieving NATO standards will demand changes in  microelectronics, computers, optical equipment, radio  electronics, and electronic surveillance. The AWACS digital  communication systems, satellite meteorologic system, satellite  system of strategic communications, integrated radiolocation  system of intelligence and weapons management -- they are all  part of NATO's equipment. Perhaps Defense Minister Radetskyy  had in mind not the global problems of the "Partnership for  Peace," but joint military exercises and maneuvers. But who  will pay for all of this? Is the Ukrainian economy able to  sustain even just a company exercise with NATO, let alone make  preparations to become an "equal partner?" Last year, the  Ukrainian Army did not hold a single exercise on the regimental  level. At a meeting with officers from the Ivano-Frankovsk  Garrison, Vitaliy Radetskyy complained that instead of resolving  combat readiness issues, he is forced to think how to provide  people with food and where he can get money for personnel to  bathe in the bath house. The experience of joint Russian-U.S.  exercises shows that in five to seven months, the Armies managed  to prepare only a small military parade involving 250 servicemen  on both sides.    According to one source of leaked information, NATO is going  to earmark $10-$30 million annually for the "Partnership for  Peace," which is, at best, some $1 million for cooperation with  each member country. For Ukraine, the "Partnership" will cost  at least $1 million. As usual, it is the people that will take  most of the burden -- even though Ukraine should hardly expect  that this much-vaunted program will secure military security  guarantees for our state.</p>

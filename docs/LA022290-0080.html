			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CULINARY SOS: PITCHING FOR A BETTER MONTE CRISTO  </P> <P> DEAR SOS: While dining recently at J's Horseshoe Restaurant in Tracy, Calif., I  had the the best Monte Cristo sandwich I've ever tasted. Can you obtain the  recipe for me?  </P> <P>  -- DOROTHY  </P> <P> DEAR DOROTHY: The Monte Cristo sandwich was also a big hit with our tasting  panel. The nice thing about the sandwich is that you can perform the restaurant  trick of assembling the sandwiches in advance and refrigerating them until  ready to cook.  </P> <P> HORSESHOE MONTE CRISTO SANDWICH  </P> <P> 18 slices bread  </P> <P> 6 slices turkey  </P> <P> 6 slices ham  </P> <P> 12 slices Swiss cheese  </P> <P> Mayonnaise  </P> <P> Batter  </P> <P> Oil for deep frying  </P> <P> Powdered sugar  </P> <P> Strawberry preserves  </P> <P> For each of 6 sandwiches, use 3 slices bread, 1 slice turkey, 1 slice ham and 2  slices cheese. Spread mayonnaise on 1 side of slice of bread. Top with slice of  turkey and cheese.  </P> <P> Add second slice of bread. Spread with mayonnaise. Layer with slice of ham and  cheese and top with third slice of bread, mayonnaise side down. Press gently.  Trim crust and cut in half diagonally, then into halves again. Chill until  ready to cook.  </P> <P> Dip sandwiches into batter. Heat oil to come 1/2 way up side of large skillet.  Add 1 or 2 sandwiches at time, depending on size of skillet, and deep fry over  medium heat until golden brown. Dust with powdered sugar and serve with  strawberry preserves. Makes 6 sandwiches.  </P> <P> Batter  </P> <P> 1 1/2 cups pancake and waffle mix  </P> <P> 1 1/2 cups milk  </P> <P> 2 eggs  </P> <P> Combine waffle mix, milk and eggs in bowl and beat until smooth.  </P> <P> DEAR SOS: My family loves Chinese food and I'd give my eye teeth for a recipe  for Sweet and Sour Pork, the kind that's dipped in batter and fried.  </P> <P>  -- ROXANNA  </P> <P> DEAR ROXANNA: There are numerous such recipes and hope you enjoy this one,  originally printed in The Times.  </P> <P> SWEET AND SOUR PORK  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons sake  </P> <P> 1/4 cup soy sauce  </P> <P> 1 pound boneless pork, cut into 1-inch cubes  </P> <P> 3 tablespoons cornstarch  </P> <P> 4 to 6 tablespoons oil  </P> <P> 1 (13 1/2-ounce) can pineapple chunks in syrup  </P> <P> 1 large onion, cut into 6 wedges  </P> <P> 2 green peppers, cut into 1-inch squares  </P> <P> 1 medium carrot, thinly sliced  </P> <P> 1/4 cup diced water chestnuts  </P> <P> 1/4 cup sugar  </P> <P> 1/4 cup catsup  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons vinegar  </P> <P> Cooked rice, optional  </P> <P> Blend sake and soy sauce in large bowl. Add pork cubes, toss lightly and let  stand 10 minutes. Drain pork, reserving soy sauce marinade. Roll pork in 2  tablespoons cornstarch.  </P> <P> Heat oil in skillet over medium heat. Add pork and brown lightly. Remove from  oil and set aside.  </P> <P> Drain pineapple chunks, reserving syrup. Add enough oil to pan drippings to  make about 1/4 cup. Saute onion, green peppers and carrot until tender-crisp,  about 4 minutes. Add water chestnuts and drained pineapple chunks.  </P> <P> Blend sugar, catsup, vinegar and remaining soy mixture. Pour over vegetables  and bring to boil. Blend remaining 1 tablespoon cornstarch with pineapple syrup  and stir into mixture. Cook until smooth and thickened, stirring occasionally.  </P> <P> Mix in reserved pork and heat just to serving temperature. Serve with hot  cooked rice. Makes 4 to 6 servings.  </P> <P> DEAR SOS: As a child, I remember my grandmother taking me to Bullock's in Los  Angeles for a fashion show and lunch. My favorite were the popovers. Do you  think you could track down the recipe? It's been 20 years since I've had them  and I'd love to share them with my family.  </P> <P>  -- TRACY  </P> <P> DEAR TRACY: These popped out of our file and we too can't wait to try them  again. The recipe has appeared many times throughout the years.  </P> <P> BULLOCK'S POPOVERS  </P> <P> 6 eggs  </P> <P> 2 cups milk  </P> <P> 2 cups flour  </P> <P> 3/4 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 6 tablespoons butter or margarine  </P> <P> Beat eggs in bowl. Beat in milk until blended. Combine flour and salt. Work  butter into flour. Gradually add flour mixture to milk and egg and blend well.  </P> <P> Fill 8 well-greased custard cups. Place on baking sheet and bake at 400 degrees  1 hour or until golden. Makes 8 popovers.  </P> <P> Note: If using new custard cups, season to prevent sticking. Cups should be  greased and placed in hot oven 30 minutes. Remove old grease and re-grease cups  before using.  </P> <P>  Only recipes of general interest will be printed.

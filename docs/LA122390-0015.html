			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: WAKE UP CALL  </P> <P> So how does Dr. Oliver Sacks feel about Columbia Pictures' just-out  "Awakenings," which chronicles his dramatic success in reviving a group of  post-encephalitic patients from their catatonic states in 1969?  </P> <P> "My reservations are very small, because the essential truth of that time was  conveyed," he tells us.  </P> <P> "I'm delighted that the story of this event and these patients is being told  again (there was a British documentary in 1973). These things were full of  wonder at many levels."  </P> <P> Director Penny Marshall's feature has fictionalized much of Sacks' own book,  which recounts his work with patients who had been mute and virtually immobile  for decades. Robin Williams portrays a doctor based loosely on Sacks, with  Robert De Niro as his primary patient, who awakens after 30 years to a changed  world and a challenging new life.  </P> <P> Sacks, technical consultant on the film, says that the actors -- "especially De  Niro" -- meticulously studied footage of the so-called "awakenings." De Niro  "had an incredible empathy and (mastery) of detail," Sacks says. "At times, I  would get totally taken in and forget he was an actor."  </P> <P> Sacks is generally pleased with the film's depiction of behavior and events --  "This was not a documentary or reconstruction, though it's authentic in many  ways" -- but remains unhappy that De Niro's character becomes violent in the  film.  </P> <P> "My main reservation is the violence on Ward 5," Sacks says. "I got very angry  about it. In fact, I walked off the set."  </P> <P> He was less upset when screenwriter Steven Zaillian created a relationship  between the doctor and a supportive nurse (played by Julie Kavner).  </P> <P> "The nurse didn't exist," Sacks says. "She was an invention.  </P> <P> "But what is Hollywood without a little love and violence?" John M. Wilson  </P></p>

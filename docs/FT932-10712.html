			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Letter: Ukraine seen as a parallel to Bosnia Sir, Your leader on Ukraine ('Nuclear rift over Ukraine', May 5) is penetrating, but overlooks a key explanatory factor in Kiev's foot-dragging over nuclear weapons. Russian nationalists have their eyes on Ukraine's large Russian minority and the areas they inhabit, the Donbas and the Crimea. The fate of the Bosnian government against the Serbs is perceived as a parallel and western inactivity is read as a signal that the west would do nothing for Ukraine in an analogous conflict. The repercussions of the war of Yugoslav succession go far beyond the frontiers of ex-Yugoslavia.

			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries becalmed ahead of inflation data APPREHENSION ahead of today's all-important inflation data left US Treasury markets becalmed yesterday as most dealers and investors chose to stay on the sidelines, fearing a possible interest rate hike if the figures show prices rising farther than expected. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  3/32 at 103 5/32 , yielding 6.871 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was unchanged at 99, to yield 4.275 per cent. Fears that a resurgence in inflation could persuade the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates has dominated trading all week, and yesterday the market's anxiety deepened. This was partly due to recent remarks by one of the Fed governors, Mr Lawrence Lindsay, who said on Wednesday that some governors might be willing temporarily to put up rates to indicate the Federal Reserve's preparedness to tackle inflation. Trading was especially quiet yesterday because the producer prices index for May is released today. If the index, which will give the market the latest reading on inflation, shows a rise of no more than 0.2 per cent (as forecast by Wall Street analysts), investors and traders will be able to breathe a sigh of relief. An increase significantly larger than forecast, however, could trigger a tightening of monetary policy and a sharp downward correction in bond prices. If the data is unconvincing in either direction, then the market is likely to hold its ground until next week, when the May consumer prices index is published. GERMAN government bonds rallied yesterday, taking heart from comments by Mr Otmar Issing, a member of the Bundesbank Council, concerning money supply growth. Mr Issing said the rapid growth in April of M3, the measure of money in circulation, which sent a shiver through the German bond market at the time of its release, was unlikely to have continued in May. Although the German market was closed yesterday, the news had a positive impact on bund trading in London. The futures contract, which weakened at first, later picked up on Mr Issing's comments and ended the day in London around 0.20 higher at 94.72. IN LONDON, UK government bonds saw an early two-way pull but the optimists won the day and the long gilt futures contract closed  1/4 point higher at 104.16. Wednesday's resignation attack on the government by Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, revived concerns over political stability but was seen more as a reason for staying away from the market than an impetus to sell. Moreover, overseas investors were tempted by the weakness of sterling and there was some switching out of the French government bond market - which has been a very strong performer recently - into gilts. In the afternoon there was some domestic buying on the belief that gilts have been oversold. Dealers said that prices were softer at the short end of the yield curve as Mr Eddie George, the governor-in-waiting of the Bank of England, sought to dampen enthusiasm for a near-term cut in base rates. FRENCH government bonds sustained their recent rise in spite of investors switching funds into the UK government bond market. The June futures contract on the Matif followed the performance of the bund market, closing 0.18 higher at 118.18 and gaining further in after-hours trading. Some economists were beginning to consider OATS over-priced and felt that the spread over 10-year bunds might start to widen again, having narrowed to as little as 16 basis points. However, BZW, in its latest bond review, believes long-term French yields will move below those in Germany within the next six months. HIGH-yielding European markets were weak yesterday, with Spanish government bond prices slipping back after the rises that followed the general election at the weekend. Italy's BTP futures fell 15 basis points to 100.05, responding in part to a weaker lira and also to concerns about the outcome of regional elections. JAPANESE government bond yields fell ahead of the release today of the key economic review. Most analysts expect the Tankan quarterly review from the Bank of Japan to show a weak economic picture and that, combined with the record strength of the yen, is likely to add weight to the argument in favour of an interest rate cut. The yield on the benchmark No 145 JGB fell two basis points to 4.48 per cent in London and Japanese government bond futures rose 0.06 to 107.89 as what one dealer decribed as 'rate cut fever' gathered pace.</p>

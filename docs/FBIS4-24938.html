			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Geoffrey Crothall in Beijing] </F>   [Text] "Tell the world", protesting students beseeched  foreign journalists as the Army stormed its way into the centre  of Beijing on the night of June 3-4, 1989.    Today, five years later, Beijing's students are equally  anxious that their voice be heard -- but it is a different  message they want to get across. "I think the Government was  right to suppress the rebellion, it was a good thing. Our  country would not be in the position it is today if action had  not been taken then," said a young undergraduate at the  prestigious Chinese People's University.    "A lot of students and ordinary people think like that. They  see that China is now quite strong and prosperous, so why should  you want to disrupt that," he said as he devoured a bowl of  noodles at one of the numerous privately-run restaurants which  have sprung up around the campus. "We are now engaged in  economic construction, that is what people should devote their  efforts to, not protesting and demonstrating," he added.    When told that many people in the West still had an image of  Chinese students as brave fighters for democracy, the student  and his friends from the university were flabbergasted. "That's  ridiculous," one of them said. "You really must report what we  are really like now."    The students said the anniversary of the June 4 massacre had  no significance for them. They were all in high school at the  time and did not take part in any of the protests and had no  sentimental attachment to the movement. "It's ancient history  now," one of them said. "The only reason we know it's the  anniversary is because of all these police outside and increased  security on the gate. Otherwise we wouldn't pay any attention to  it at all."    Nearly all the undergraduates from the People's University  interviewed on Friday [3 June] and yesterday had a low opinion  of the 1989 democracy movement. "We can say now the movement  was badly organised. They did not have clear objectives and did  not understand the reality of the situation," one said. "People  like Wang Dan and Wuer Kaixi were actually very poor students,  they got very bad marks in their exams."    They accused Wang Dan of cheating his fellow hunger-strikers  by sneaking off to restaurants at night and having a good feed  while the others suffered in the square. Wuerkaixi, they  claimed, had embezzled funds. "Look at where they are now. How  can you say these people have achieved anything of note?"  another student said.    While the students insisted that their views were their own  and were not simply repeating a government line, many graduates  said their younger colleagues had been brainwashed. "When I was  at university (in the mid-1980s) all our teachers were open and  encouraged us to develop new ideas but since 1989 the teachers  have been much more controlled and have reverted to the old  style of education," one graduate said. "The Government has put  a lot of work into so-called patriotic education. And it must  be said they have been successful," he said. "As you can see  there really is a big generation gap between my generation and  the students today."</p>

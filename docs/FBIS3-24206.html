Vladivostok residents will answer two questions:    1. Do you find it expedient to approve a common system of  city administration, which envisages the functioning of city  services as one whole, with the phased elimination of rayon  administrations?    2. Do you agree with the text of the draft Vladivostok  Charter?    This draft contains the basic principles of organizing the  representative and executive authority in Vladivostok and  defines their powers in the structure of local self-rule bodies.

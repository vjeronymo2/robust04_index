			<p><P> January 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHLAND SPORTS FANS SHOULD GIVE THANKS  </P> <P> I read sports letters in wonderment at the attitude of Southern California  sports fans. Being a native Texan and a graduate of the University of Texas, I  can tell you how far a football program can fall (let's not even discuss the  Dallas Cowboys).  </P> <P> Last year Texas was 4-7 and on the wrong end of a couple of blowouts.  </P> <P> Instead of incessant criticism of a couple of top 10 football teams and  coaches, Southern California fans should all stop and remind themselves how  lucky they are.  </P> <P> BRADLEY SAINT-LAURENT  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

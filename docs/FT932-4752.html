			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Paisley obstacle to Ulster talks EFFORTS to re-start the political dialogue in Ulster received a blow yesterday when the Rev Ian Paisley said he would not meet Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland Secretary. Sir Patrick invited leaders of the four main constitutional parties to meet him separately over the next two weeks. But the Democratic Unionist party leader told the Northern Ireland Office he was not interested in discussion until the Irish Republic removed its territorial claim over Ulster or while Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist SDLP, was holding discussions with Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein.</p>

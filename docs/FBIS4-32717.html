			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 27/6/1994 -- The National  Peasant Christian-Democratic Party [PNTCD] is waiting for a  sufficient number of signatures to be gathered in order to start  the procedure of suspending President Ion Iliescu from office,  stated PNTCD spokesman Senator Radu Vasile.    He cautioned during today's weekly news conference that the  decision of Romania's Prosecutor General of appellation against  final court decisions regarding the confiscated houses was a  direct consequence of President Iliescu's position.    Regarding the no-confidence motion [against the Nicolae  Vacaroiu government], the PNTCD leadership considered that  irrespective of the results of the vote, a change of the  government was inevitable, and it did not rule out the  likeliness of early elections either, considering the grave  economic situation.    The leadership of the PNTCD considers that the Democratic  Party-National Salvation Front's [PD-FSN] position in the  opposition is declarative, rather than based on concrete  actions. Referring to that party's "hesitant" stand on the  PNTCD's initiative to suspend President Ion Iliescu from office,  Senator Radu Vasile noted that the PD-FSN was manifest as an  opposition party "especially on an external plane [abroad]."  Both Radu Vasile and Ion Diaconescu, PNTCD first deputy  presidents, disapproved of the PD-FSN parliamentarians' having  failed to sign so far the list regarding the suspension  procedure. "This is a conjuncture alliance pursuing to change  the parliamentary majority," said Ion Diaconescu cautioning that  this alliance "does not mean we have forgiven the FSN's  [National Salvation Front] past mistakes made at the time it was  the ruling party."</p>

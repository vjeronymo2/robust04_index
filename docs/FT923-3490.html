			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Pendragon increases 7% to Pounds 2.17m despite disappointing car sales PENDRAGON, the luxury and executive cars dealer, yesterday announced a slight increase in interim profits, despite disappointing sales of new and used cars. Pre-tax profits increased 7 per cent, from Pounds 2.02m to Pounds 2.17m. However, this did not match growth in turnover, which was up 31 per cent at Pounds 101m (Pounds 77m) due to acquisitions. Mr Trevor Finn, chief executive, said new car sales volumes were higher, but margins had fallen, while sales of used cars declined. 'People are buying, but there are very few emotional purchases taking place. It is all sensible, commercial buying,' he said. Business cars such as Mercedes Benz and BMW had increased sales. But luxury cars - where margins are higher - such as Rolls-Royce and Ferrari continued to be poor. With customers delaying purchases, cars were getting older and requiring more after-sales service. This division increased its proportion of group revenues to 56 per cent, compared to 44 per cent two years ago. Contract hire was flat at about 6 per cent of turnover. Operating profits increased 15 per cent to Pounds 3.12m (Pounds 2.72m). Higher borrowings to fund acquisitions pushed interest costs to Pounds 949,000 (Pounds 698,000). Mr Finn said borrowings would rise to between Pounds 8m and Pounds 9m by the year end, less than 30 per cent of shareholders' funds of Pounds 35.2m. The interim dividend is lifted 10 per cent to 2.2p (2p) on earnings of 5p (5.9p) Pendragon also announced the acquisition of two dealerships - one for Honda and the other for Aston Martin - for about Pounds 1.3m. The company now has 45 franchises, including two in Germany, compared to 23 two years ago.</p>

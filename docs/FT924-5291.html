			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Lonely ride into sunset: Unless John Smith transforms the UK's Labour party and speeds up its move to the political centre, another election defeat beckons There is a short answer to the question, 'does the British left have anywhere to go?' It is 'no'. For the Labour party appears to be living in a fantasy world in which the Conservatives self-destruct, an early general election follows, and Mr John Smith becomes prime minister. The dream will not come true. Not that way. Mr Smith may one day move into Number 10 Downing Street, but first he must totally transform his party. If it is to win again, Labour must no longer be regarded as a party of the left. It must be separated from the trade unions. There is time for such a renewal. No election need be held until 1996 or 1997. By then the redistribution of constituency boundaries will have created another 10 or 20 seats whose demographic profiles favour the Tories. The recession will (surely) have come to an end. The party that faced the Conservatives in mid-slump in April 1992 and lost will, if nothing has changed, lose, lose and lose again. Reality could be different. If Labour makes a complete break with its own history and traditions - in essence, creates a fresh political force - it may stand a chance. The slimness of that chance may be measured by the performance of the Democrats in the recent US elections. Governor Bill Clinton did not campaign as the candidate of the poor, the dispossessed or the proletariat. He ran on a promise to meet the concerns of the middle classes. Socialism neither entered his mind nor obscured his vocabulary. He denied his party's liberal past by stressing the 'new' in 'new Democrats'. The public feeling was that there was no end to the recession. Mr Clinton peddled a Keynesian revival, Victorian social values and 'hope'. In the event he won by a far smaller margin than had been anticipated. Had it not been for a statistical quirk, much of that advantage could have melted away. The US Commerce Department's estimate of third-quarter growth, originally 2.7 per cent, was revised upwards this week to 3.9 per cent. President George Bush must be wondering what might have happened if that figure had been available, and believed, during the campaign. As it is, Mr Clinton may enjoy the advantages of coming to office at the start of a return to real growth in the US economy. Mr Smith is not so fortunate. He has become Labour's leader in time to see prosperity return before he gets to fight a general election. Truly there is no hope for parties of the left, not in the sense the term has been used until now. Professor J K Galbraith has an explanation. He believes that during the last half century the left, particularly in Britain, has saved capitalism. He said so on Tuesday. In a lecture to the Institute for Public Policy Research, a think-tank of the left, he listed old-age insurance, unemployment compensation, medical care, public housing, improved public services, the ending of the 'once-cruel exploitation of women and children' and the like as ingredients of a social revolution that 'has taken the cruel edge off capitalism'. In consequence 'our claim is not to violent change, certainly not to revolution. It is to a socially better performance by the existing system.' We are now, the professor intimated, in the age of 'constructive pragmatism'. That would be all fine and dandy for Labour if the Conservatives represented something else - destructive ideology, say. They did for a while, particularly during the years 1987-1990. But just two years ago this weekend they jettisoned the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher and replaced her with the supremely pragmatic Mr John Major. He has had a run of bad luck, and at times has made the worst of his misfortunes, but he has not sought to place the cruel edge back on to capitalism. Contrary to Labour's eager expectations, the social security budget has not been cut. Most payouts will be increased in line with inflation. This will leave the poorest among us with pretty thin gruel. For the life of me I cannot imagine what it is like to live on income support or unemployment benefit of less than Pounds 2,250 a year (basic levels for a single person). Yet Labour could only find money with which to improve on these meagre sums by increasing taxation. To propose that is a proven vote-loser. Mr Clinton advocated tax increases for families with annual incomes greater than Dollars 200,000. He only just got away with it. The Clinton programme, which centres around 'workfare', is politically saleable as a hand-up, not a hand-out. The benefit system that most appeals to electorates on either side of the Atlantic is the one that delivers comfort and cash to the middle classes. Labour is still wrestling with this. The 'Commission for Social Justice' which Mr Smith espouses has yet to be established. I am told that its chairman will be known by Christmas. He or she will do well to approach half the standard of intellectual rigour and thoroughness of the Beveridge Report, the work of a Liberal, which was first published exactly 50 years ago. Beveridge advocated workfare, proposing that unemployment benefit should be 'subject to requirement of attendance at a work or training centre after a limited period . . .' After that, 'complete idleness even on an income demoralises'. He did acknowledge the proposal to be impracticable in periods of high unemployment. A second Beveridge lesson for Labour is fiscal. The report, printed in 1942, projects spending on social security for the years 1945, 1955 and 1965. Only the cost of pensions rises significantly. Unemployment benefit falls slightly; the health services (which would soon make everyone well) remain at a flat level of cost. As an exercise in optimistic under-estimation of future expenditure the Beveridge arithmetic has not to my knowledge ever been exceeded - not even by the designers of nuclear generating plants. Labour must find new ways of thinking, and get them straight. One of its unique selling points should be constitutional reform. Another should be strong environmental protection, using selective taxation as an instrument. A carbon tax would be a mixed blessing, but it could serve as a method of raising revenue that, like VAT, would be politically less painful than direct imposts on incomes. The danger is that the Tories are already ahead: they are making pencilled-in calculations about both a carbon tax and toll booths for roads. The government is also denying Labour the opportunity of differentiating itself by promoting the abandonment of strict monetary controls in favour of Keynesian pump-priming. Mr Smith, who became leader on July 18, is approaching all of this at a measured pace, with long interruptions to respond to the dramas on the Conservative benches. Some of his colleagues believe that he cannot afford such a luxury. If he is ever to become prime minister, his goal for 1993 should be to create a new party. He would then have about three years - a desperately short time - in which to convince the voters that Labour really had changed. It will be amazing if he pulls it off.</p>

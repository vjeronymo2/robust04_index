			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DISAPPEARING CENTER CAN BAFFLE CLEMSON;  </P> <P> EAST REGIONAL: MORNINGSIDE PRODUCT ELDEN CAMPBELL SOMETIMES DOES IT ALL FOR  TIGERS, WHO FACE CONNECTICUT TONIGHT.  </P> <P> And now, introducing the Duo of Doom, nearly 14 feet tall, laced into two pairs  of size-15 1/2 sneakers and topped by twin flat-tops suitable for high fashion  or possibly helicopter landings.  </P> <P> But Duo of Doom?  </P> <P> "I guess Twin Towers was already taken," said smiling 6-foot-11 senior center  Elden Campbell, who has been running somewhat short of grins recently.  </P> <P> Clemson's high hopes of upsetting Connecticut (30-5) in tonight's East Regional  semifinal round lean on Campbell and 6-11 forward Dale Davis.  </P> <P> Will they be up to the task? If everything goes right, Campbell thinks it could  be Doom's day.  </P> <P> "We haven't been favored for a lot of things this year," said Campbell, from  Morningside High School in Inglewood. "I'm lucky because I get another chance.  I'll just go out and be a leader."  </P> <P> Actually, Clemson is here because the whole team got lucky against Brigham  Young. The Tigers escaped with a 49-47 first-round victory, despite shooting  33%, missing 16 free throws and scoring just 10 points in the first 15 minutes  of the second half.  </P> <P> Campbell ended the game with 15 points and seven rebounds, and Davis had 11  rebounds.  </P> <P> Next, Clemson trailed La Salle by 16 points at halftime but came back to win,  79-75, despite shooting only 12.5% from three-point range.  </P> <P> In that game, only one of the Duo played up to expectations. Davis came through  with 25 points and 17 rebounds, but Campbell staggered through a seven-point,  five-rebound, five-foul performance.  </P> <P> Campbell once again heard from his critics, who said Clemson's attack was more  like the Uno of Doom.  </P> <P> Campbell's failings have often been lively topics of discussion among Clemson  faithful. When Campbell was benched for the last six minutes of the first half  and the first three minutes of the second half in the BYU game, it did not go  unnoticed.  </P> <P> Coach Cliff Ellis said it was no mistake.  </P> <P> "You can't ever put an individual before the team," he said. "You have to do  what's right. Elden Campbell has not been the only one on our team who's had to  sit. But naturally, if it's in the NCAA, people notice it a little bit more."  </P> <P> The most notable Clemson center since Wayne (Tree) Rollins, Campbell led the  Tigers in scoring and blocked shots, was second in rebounding and steals, and  was third in shooting.  </P> <P> But it wasn't what Campbell did that bothered his critics, it was the way he  did it. A finesse player, Campbell plays an emotionless game that belies his  doom-dispensing nickname.  </P> <P> Morningside Coach Carl Franklin said he is not surprised Campbell caught flak  because of his demeanor.  </P> <P> "He has a real easygoing manner," Franklin said. "He makes everything look  easy. But I never had any trouble getting him to play hard for me.  </P> <P> "I'm sensitive to the criticism," Franklin said. "We were more patient with  him. We didn't try to pressure him so hard he burned himself out or turned him  off.  </P> <P> "They say, 'Oh, if they can just get him to play a little harder.' Sure, he has  an easy manner, but that doesn't mean he doesn't play hard."  </P> <P> Campbell blocked 94 shots this season, and Clemson (26-8) won its first  Atlantic Coast Conference regular-season championship. One of Campbell's valued  skills is that he can block shots with either hand.  </P> <P> He can also score. Campbell had 20 or more points 11 times this season. Still,  Ellis did not start Campbell on five occasions.  </P> <P> Said UCLA Coach Jim Harrick, who tried to recruit Campbell for Pepperdine:  "He's a very tough player, but he's also kind of a sleepy-eyed kid who always  gives the impression he needs his heart jump-started."  </P> <P> In the ACC tournament, Campbell was slowed by flu and strep throat, and lost 15  pounds. Campbell said he is still recovering.  </P> <P> As for sitting down against BYU, Campbell said it was "no big thing."  </P> <P> And as for playing poorly against La Salle, Campbell is thankful for another  chance against Connecticut, the surprise team of the season.  </P> <P> "I look at it as a second chance for me," he said. "In the last two games, I  really wasn't playing well, but we got lucky in the BYU game and then won  another.  </P> <P> "I'm just fortunate to have another opportunity to play like I can and not to  have to go out on a low note."  </P> <P> Against Connecticut, another low note is possible for Clemson. On paper, it is  an intriguing match-up. The Huskies are not big, but their smothering pressure  defense is an equalizer. Meanwhile, the Tigers are big enough, but their  backcourt may be susceptible to pressure, and their inability to shoot  three-pointers may be their downfall.  </P> <P> "All I know is we've won 26 games this way," Ellis said.  </P> <P> So, as Clemson seeks to upset Connecticut, Campbell tries to redeem his  reputation.  </P> <P> "I know what I'm capable of," Campbell said.  </P> <P> Ellis, who would not permit Campbell to attend Clemson's pregame news  conference, said he is trying to shield the vulnerable half of the Duo of Doom  from too much pressure.  </P> <P> "Maybe he's thinking a little bit now about the pressure, and I want to take  part of that burden off his shoulders," Ellis said. "He's pressing himself."  </P> <P> Connecticut will try to do the same thing tonight.  </P></p>

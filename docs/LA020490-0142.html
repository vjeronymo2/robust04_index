			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> NHL NOTES;  </P> <P> NORTH STARS WOULD COME FULL CIRCLE IN MOVE TO OAKLAND  </P> <P> The North Stars' plan to relocate is no idle threat. It is likely they will not  return to Bloomington, Minn., next season and will play in Oakland.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, the North Stars applied to the NHL for permission to transfer  their franchise to an unspecified location after the season. Brothers George  and Gordon Gund co-own the team. Gordon told the St. Paul Pioneer Press  Dispatch, "Oakland is our choice. It's the fourth-largest market in the U.S.  and it's where George lives."  </P> <P> If the North Stars want to move, in the wake of Al Davis' legal victory over  the NFL, there is no way the NHL can prevent it. The North Stars say they will  lose $4 million this season for a total of $16 million in losses from 1987-90.  They have demanded that $15 million in improvements be made at their  15,093-seat Met Center, including the doubling of luxury suites from 20 to 40.  The Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission, which owns the arena, is  expected to offer a compromise at its next meeting Feb. 21.  </P> <P> Its director of operations, Dennis Alfton, told Newsday, "They want us to spend  $15 million so they can get $13 million in additional revenue over the next  four years. That's hard to agree to." Alfton said the commission received the  proposal Wednesday and is digesting it.  </P> <P> Bloomington Mayor Neil Peterson said, "I think the commission will try to do  something. If not, the North Stars are gone and it's their fault."  </P> <P> The NBA's Timberwolves, drawing 24,000 fans a game at the Metrodome, will move  into a new 18,000-seat arena in Minneapolis this fall. On Wednesday, they  offered the North Stars three years rent-free in it.  </P> <P> Gordon Gund rejected that offer. He said he paid only $126,000 in rent last  year, so free rent is no big deal. Gund said if his team moved to the new  arena, where it would not share parking, concession, advertising and luxury-box  revenue, it would lose $18 million in the next four years instead of the $10  million he projects if it stays put.  </P> <P> Alfton said, "We want to keep the North Stars," but added the commission might  let the debt-ridden team go and seek an expansion franchise. "That probably  will be one of the alternatives we'll review," he said.  </P> <P> "This is a good area," Alfton said. "A lot of good hockey is played here. But  the North Stars have not put a good product on the ice. Improvements need to be  made (to Met Center). But that isn't the reason people aren't going there."  </P> <P> The North Stars say they are selling fewer than 11,000 tickets per game and  their tickets-used average is 7,800, the NHL's worst. NHL spokesman Gerry  Helper said franchise relocations require an amendment to the league  constitution plus a unanimous vote from its Board of Governors. Such amendments  and votes were obtained by the Atlanta Flames when they moved to Calgary in  1980 and the Colorado Rockies in 1982 when they became the Devils. The board  meets Feb. 19-20 in Chicago.  </P> <P> If the move is approved, the North Stars franchise will have come full circle.  It was one of six expansion clubs that joined the NHL in 1967. Eleven years  later, it merged with the Cleveland Barons, who lasted two winless seasons  after having been transplanted from Oakland in 1976.  </P> <P> Oakland never had a winning season in nine years and was the NHL's worst  drawing team. George Gund was a one-third owner of the Oakland franchise when  it shifted to Cleveland and bought out his partners. The North Stars had five  straight winning seasons from 1979-84 but have had only one in the past five.  </P> <P> NHL President John Ziegler, who seems sympathetic, said, "It is imperative that  each (club) has maximum revenue opportunity from the area in which the team  plays. It is well-recognized that the Met Center at the present time does not  provide the type facilities which will be needed for the North Stars to compete  in the '90s."  </P> <P> Can Oakland support a team? Groups in San Francisco and San Jose are vying for  an expansion franchise. If the North Stars move, they would be co-tenants at  the 15,039-seat Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum with the NBA's Golden State  Warriors. A new arena is expected to be built nearby soon.  </P> <P> The Coliseum is owned by the city and county and run by Coliseum, Inc., whose  president, George Vukasin, referred questions to the North Stars. The Gunds did  not return calls to Newsday.  </P> <P> Remember last spring when goaltending seemed the least of the Blackhawks'  worries? Alain Chevrier had a 2.61 goals-against average in 16 playoff games,  leading them to series victories over Detroit and St. Louis before they were  ousted by Calgary.  </P> <P> Chicago has the NHL's fourth-best record (29-19-4) after Thursday night's 7-4  win over the Los Angeles Kings in Inglewood, Calif., but goaltending now is its  biggest problem. Coach Mike Keenan has yanked his starting goalie 12 times this  season. The Blackhawks are 4-8 in those games. Saturday he used Chevrier and  Jacques Cloutier twice each in a 6-4 loss in Hartford.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, Blackhawks General Manager Bob Pulford and assistant Jack Davison  flew to Czechoslovakia to try to sign goalie Domenic Hasek, their 10th-round  1983 draft pick. Chicago's first-round choice in 1987, goalie Jimmy Waite, is  playing with Indianapolis of the IHL.  </P> <P> To prepare for the Kings, Keenan held a three-day mini-camp at a ski resort at  Lake Arrowhead East of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> In a 7-4 home win over the Kings last month, three French-speaking Maple Leafs  were chosen as stars of the game, a rarity in English-speaking Toronto.  </P> <P> "There hasn't been many French guys play here," said left wing Vincent  Damphousse, who was named first star. The others were Daniel Marois and Gilles  Thibadeau. They played on a line until Jan. 19, when Thibadeau was sent to  Newmarket of the AHL.  </P> <P> "I was the first French guy they drafted in the first round (in 1986),"  Damphousse said. "I was born and raised in Montreal. We're all hockey players.  In Quebec, most of the players are playmakers and scorers. Hopefully, they'll  realize there's some good players in Quebec and draft more."  </P> <P> Former Red Wings left wing Bob Probert is to be released from prison next week,  but his problems are not over. He pleaded guilty to importing cocaine and was  convicted after being arrested in March with 14.3 grams.  </P> <P> A Chicago immigration judge on Jan. 2 ordered Probert, a Canadian citizen,  deported, citing the conviction and his history of alcoholism. Probert has  appealed.  </P> <P> The appeal process could take a year. In the meantime, he is not permitted to  leave the United States. So, if the Red Wings reinstate him, he could not play  in Canada. No date has been set for hearing his appeal.  </P> <P> Detroit Coach Jacques Demers said of Probert, "Even if he wins, I would think  it will be a year or more before he comes back. We need a tremendous commitment  from Bob Probert before we'll let him anywhere near the team."  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUSH 'REALLY' LIT YULE TREE, AIDE SAYS, FUDGING ON REAGAN  </P> <P> President Bush pressed "the real thing" when he switched on the National  Christmas Tree, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said today, but he hesitated when  asked the same question about former President Reagan.  </P> <P> "I better let that go," Fitzwater said when asked if Reagan had used a phony  button in the years that he lit the tree from the safety of a White House  balcony, several hundred yards from the tree.  </P> <P> "Is your non-answer an answer?" he was asked.  </P> <P> "Well, sort of," responded Fitzwater, who served as press spokesman to Reagan  before taking on the same assignment with Bush.  </P> <P> Asked about this year's ceremony, Fitzwater asserted without hesitation: "Last  night was the real thing."  </P> <P> Bush lit the 35-foot national tree Thursday night in person at a public outdoor  ceremony on the Ellipse. During his eight years in office, Reagan stayed within  the White House complex for the ceremony, supposedly lighting the Christmas  tree by remote control.  </P></p>

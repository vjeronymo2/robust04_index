			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Standard not necessarily to do with product quality Sir, As a former business director for commodity chemicals in one of the world's largest chemical companies, the attacks on BS 5750/ISO 9000 provide me with a belated sense of 'I told you so' ('Quality under fire', June 21). I regarded the so-called standards as one of the biggest con games ever perpetrated on the chemical industry, since they did not necessarily have anything to do with the quality of the final product or its fitness for use. If the BS/ISO certification defines a process which is less than optimal, product quality can be affected. For chemical products the physical and chemical specifications agreed between the customer and the producer should be the prime criterion. The manner by which the producer makes the chemical or acquires it in the event that his plant cannot produce for any reason should be irrelevant to the customer. The guarantee to the customer must be that the product supplied is 'on spec'. The only winners in the BS/ISO game have been those that carried out the certification process which is unbelievably time-consuming and expensive. An American friend of mine (also in the chemical business) assured me that the initials 'BS' had a meaning other than 'British Standard' when the number 5750 was involved.

			<p><P> October 4, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NHL OPENING SEASON OF PERSONAL GOALS  </P> <P> When the NHL opens its 73rd season with nine games Thursday night, Wayne  Gretzky will not be the only one shooting for a milestone.  </P> <P> While Gretzky's pursuit of Gordie Howe's all-time scoring record may overshadow  other individual achievements, several other players also have their eyes on  new levels.  </P> <P> Three players have a chance this season to reach the career 1,000-point mark,  and another player has a shot at the 500-goal level.  </P> <P> Quebec's Peter Stastny is closest to 1,000 points, needing just 14 to join the  exclusive club. Edmonton's Jari Kurri is 50 points away and Chicago's Denis  Savard 67.  </P> <P> Bryan Trottier of the New York Islanders figures to join the 500-goal club this  season. He needs just 13 to make it. Trottier also needs 32 assists to move  past Phil Esposito (873) into fifth place on the all-time assist list.  </P> <P> Four players are gunning for milestones in the assist category. Larry Robinson  of the Kings is closing in on 700, and Pittsburgh's Paul Coffey, Montreal's  Bobby Smith and Boston's Ray Bourque are nearing 600. Robinson needs 14 assists  to reach his milestone, Coffey needs 5, Smith 10 and Bourque 56.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Gretzky will continue his pursuit of Howe's scoring record of 1,850  points when the Los Angeles Kings play host to the Toronto Maple Leafs in one  of Thursday night's openers. (Story, Part III, Page 1.) The Kings center needs  just 14 to surpass the Detroit Red Wings' great.  </P></p>

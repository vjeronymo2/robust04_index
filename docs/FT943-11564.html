			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Office rents in Far East cities outstrip west's finance centres Rents for city offices in China and Vietnam have risen sharply this year to become some of the most expensive in the world as international companies seek footholds in rapidly emerging markets. Accommodation is in such short supply that some companies are working from hotels and town houses. Rents in Shanghai, Beijing, Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City have outstripped leading financial centres such as London, Paris, New York and Frankfurt, according to a study by international property consultants Richard Ellis. Only Tokyo and Hong Kong have higher rents. Ellis is currently operating out of rooms in the Beijing Toronto hotel in China's capital. It says the pace of new development has been insufficient to satisfy growing demand from international companies. Rents in Shanghai and Beijing have rocketed by 30 per cent in the past six months alone. The shortage of space has left 'a number of foreign businesses operating from hotel rooms', says the agent. Hotel rooms also have been converted into office space in Guangzhou, where rents have risen by 9 per cent in the past six months. In Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, in Vietnam, companies have been forced to rent town houses, villas and hotels. A total of 1,500 foreign companies are housed in just 10 dedicated office buildings in Shanghai, China's main financial centre, where some of the country's biggest property developments are under way. Cities in the South-East Asia account for eight out of the 11 most expensive office locations according to the agent, which compared accommodation costs in 45 business centres. Most expensive was the inner central district of Tokyo where rents of Pounds 98.32 a sq ft increased to Pounds 111.67 after service charges and property taxes. Total occupation costs in Hong Kong were Pounds 97.05 a sq ft. London remains the third most expensive city with total occupation costs of Pounds 68.71 a sq ft in the West End and Pounds 61.88 in the City - but this does not include rent free periods and other inducements offered to tenants in a market which until recently remained very depressed. Also, property taxes are expected to fall sharply in London next year. Paris was the eighth most expensive location and New York mid-town was the 13th, with total property costs of Pounds 47.72 and Pounds 38.85 a sq ft, respectively.  ----------------------------------------------------------------             WORLD OFFICE RENTS (per square foot)  ----------------------------------------------------------------                                 Net               Total                                rent                cost*  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Tokyo (inner central)  Pounds 98.32        Pounds 111.67 Hong Kong              Pounds 87.26         Pounds 97.05 London (West End)      Pounds 40.00         Pounds 68.71 London (City)          Pounds 30.00         Pounds 61.88 Shanghai               Pounds 49.62         Pounds 54.58 Tokyo (outer central)  Pounds 44.22         Pounds 52.87 Beijing                Pounds 44.80         Pounds 49.28 Paris                  Pounds 40.06         Pounds 47.72 Hanoi                  Pounds 41.25         Pounds 47.66 Ho Chi Minh City       Pounds 34.83         Pounds 41.25 Guangzhou              Pounds 36.05         Pounds 40.56 Mexico City            Pounds 33.66         Pounds 39.23  ---------------------------------------------------------------- *inc local property taxes and service charges  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Source; Richard Ellis  ----------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / German retail sales down 6% German retail sales fell a real 6 per cent during April, and were down 10 per cent on the comparable month last year, the federal statistics office said yesterday. Although the figures were distorted because the Easter shopping rush fell in March this year, economists said the decline confirmed expectations that shrinking real incomes were stifling private sector demand. The fall, widely forecast, followed an unexpectedly strong first quarter. The cumulative total shows real sales in the first four months were a real 2 per cent lower than in 1993. James Capel's London office calculated that combining March and April data, and thus discounting the effect of the early Easter holiday, sales for the two months were 4 per cent lower year-on-year. According to the statistics office only drugs, cosmetics and paper and printed goods have managed year-on-year increases in the first four months. Clothing sales were down 4 per cent and turnover from road vehicles fell 3 per cent. Mail order deliveries were unchanged in the period, but other leading outlets showed sales declines of between 3 and 5 per cent.</p>

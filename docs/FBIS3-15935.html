			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with B. Gromov, deputy minister of defense of </F> Russia, by V. Starkov; place and date not given: "`Our Army Has  Its de Gaulles'"]    [Text] Colonel General Boris Gromov, Hero of the  Soviet Union, needs no special introduction. Former commander of  the 40th Army, he became renowned not only for having fought  successfully in Afghanistan but also for having pulled the army  out of there in militarily competent fashion, practically  without losses. General Gromov is now deputy minister of defense  of Russia.    [Starkov] You have a very handsome name. It resonates with  something legendary. Do you know its historical roots?    [Gromov] I grew up in a family in which my ancestors,  starting with my great grandfather, taught foreign languages.  My father died at the front in 1943, two months before I was  born.    [Starkov] Do you know any foreign language?    [Gromov] The curriculum at the Suvorov School in Saratov,  where I was a student, allotted nine hours a week for the study  of foreign languages.    In addition, for one whole day from reveille to taps  everyone  was required to communicate only in English or French. I once  spoke English well. But to speak a language fluently you need  constant practice, which I have not had for a long time. Taking  part in negotiations, though, I still understand my partner.  <H5>  `The Putschists Did Not Confide in Me' </H5>   [Starkov] Following your return from Afghanistan, yours has  been a complex fate. There have been ups and downs. There have  continually been attempts to pin some labels on you and to  involve you in something or other. You, on the other hand,  remain one of the most outstanding and influential, but at the  same time enigmatic political figures.    [Gromov] I have never shied from side to side or changed my  position in deference to the current situation and have not  bowed down before anyone.    [Starkov] On the eve of the August events you calmly went on  leave. Does this mean that the putschists did not confide in the  first deputy minister of internal affairs?    [Gromov] I was lucky, they truly did not confide in me.  Because had they done so, they would have let me into some of  their plans.    And then I was simply called back from leave and told: Come  on, call off the troops. That is, attempts were made to make me,  at my age and in my position and rank, a pawn.    Do you know what the internal troops are? They are units  specially trained for street fighting. And then, based on my  actual experience, I realized what was brewing and to what this  could lead. And when I saw that these people, Yanayev, Pavlov,  and the others, had made it their aim to seize the White House,  which no one needed, I understood conclusively that this was all  just an adventure.    [Starkov] You did not support the Emergency Committee. In  other words, you felt that the time of Gorbachev, Yazov, and  Kryuchkov was up?    [Gromov] Perestroyka, which was pursued without any plan  whatever, could not have produced positive results. A true  politician should not resemble a soccer player, who runs faster  than he thinks.    [Starkov] For a long time you were the personal  representative of Marshal S. Akhromeyev in Afghanistan and,  evidently, knew this person well. Are you not tormented by the  mystery of his death?    [Gromov] Marshal Akhromeyev was, in my view, the conscience  of the armed forces. A soldier of the front, he had devoted his  whole life to strengthening the country's defense capability. He  did a great deal for the army, particularly as chief of the  General Staff. He was a very intelligent and most punctilious  and decent person, who knew his business.    The collapse of the system was a real drama for people of  the  older generation, and for Marshal Akhromeyev, a tragedy. I do  not believe he was afraid of being put on trial. He simply could  not reconcile himself to the fact that everything he had lived  for and had sacredly believed in would be demolished.  <H5>  Afghanistan </H5>   [Starkov] Why did you go there a second time?    [Gromov] Marshal Akhromeyev had proposed that I head the  group of representatives of the General Staff in Afghanistan. He  needed unembellished reports on the actual situation in the  country. In other words, use was made of the experience of the  Great Patriotic War, when representatives of the General  Headquarters endowed with special powers operated at the fronts.    [Starkov] What do you think, why was such a big country as  the Soviet Union with a most powerful army not the winner in  Afghanistan? Could we, generally, have won the Afghan war --  there was already the experience of the Americans in Vietnam,  after all.    [Gromov] Defeating a people by way of arms is impossible. In  addition, this was not the mission given the limited contingent  of Soviet troops. The 40th Army was to have supported the  revolutionary regime in Kabul, neutralized the armed opposition  detachments on the country's territory, and prevented their  penetration of Afghanistan from abroad.    [Starkov] It would be sinful not to ask you about Rutskoy.  Did you know him from Afghanistan?    [Gromov] Of course. And, as army commander, I participated  most actively in his release from captivity, when he had been  shot down for the second time.    We had no news of him at all for several weeks. Thinking  that  Rutskoy, deputy commander of the army air force, had died, I  signed a recommendation for the posthumous conferment on him of  the title of hero. Shortly afterward, military intelligence  agents managed for a very large amount of money to learn that he  had been taken prisoner, ascertained where he was, and  immediately began to negotiate for his release.    [Starkov] So Rutskoy was ransomed? For how much?    [Gromov] It was a large ransom--several million dollars. But  when it is a question of a human life, no money is begrudged.  Besides, Rutskoy was an excellent pilot. But pilot and  politician are different things.  <H5>  Last October </H5>   [Starkov] So, blood is the symbol of the 1970's, 1980's, and  1990's. The military tried to avoid bloodshed both in  Afghanistan and in August 1991. Could you not clarify the  situation--what happened in October 1993?    [Gromov] I can say nothing in this connection because I was  not a participant in the October events either. Nor was I  present at the well-known nighttime session of the Ministry of  Defense Collegium.    [Starkov] You were not invited?    [Gromov] I was simply not there, I could not get there.  Operational-strategic exercises codenamed Zapad began in the  armed forces on 21 September, when the edict of the president  was promulgated. Practically all forces stationed in the west of  the country were taking part. These exercises had been planned  back at the start of 1993. I first heard about the edict in  Kaliningrad, having hardly disembarked from the airplane, from  correspondents, who just about knocked me off my feet. They were  demanding comment, and I did not understand what they were  talking about.    [Starkov] You evidently weighed up the scenario in the  October situation, for all that. Let us suppose that the army  did not intervene. What would have happened next? There they are  in the White House, we are here, the president is in the  Kremlin....    [Gromov] It is essential to use the internal troops in such  a  situation. First, this is required by the law. Second, MVD  troops are stationed in Moscow and in the vicinity, there are  practically no army units in the capital. They are stationed far  beyond the city.    The Dzerzhinskiy Internal Troops Division, in particular, is  specially intended for operations in emergency situations on the  territory of the capital. This is a crack formation. The  servicemen--from the soldier through the commander of the  division-- have excellent professional training. Special  subunits of the Dzerzhinskiy Division can in their helicopters  be at any point of Moscow within 10 minutes, provided there is  somewhere to land.    [Starkov] It is known that you and Yazov had a difficult  relationship. How is it shaping up with the present defense  minister?    [Gromov] Normally; we were in Afghanistan twice, for that  matter. At first I was a divisional commander, he, deputy  regimental commander. Then I was appointed commander of the 40th  Army, General Grachev, commander of an airborne division.    [Starkov] Are there often attempts to set you at odds?    [Gromov] Yes, it should not be forgotten that we live in  Russia.  <H5>  Military Diplomacy </H5>   [Starkov] Your name does not correspond all that well to  your  image. You are not in principle a "loud" person--you are never  at the center of rows. What issues do you handle in the Ministry  of Defense?    [Gromov] I am responsible for all negotiating processes and  relations with countries of the near abroad.    [Starkov] Which CIS republic has given you the most  difficulty?    [Gromov] It is difficult everywhere. For a very long time we  were unable to find a common language with the leadership of  Ukraine. Problems of the use of strategic nuclear forces on the  territory of Kazakhstan are proving hard to resolve. We are  extremely concerned at the situation of the Russian-speaking  population in the Baltic. The development of the situation in  Tajikistan is causing particular concern. Events there are  developing literally according to the Afghan script of 15 years  back. Lest Russia become tied up there the same as in  Afghanistan, it was decided to create in this region a coalition  force with the participation of Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyzstan, Russia, and Tajikistan.    [Starkov] You often travel overseas together with Kozyrev.  Are there some subtleties in relations between you? Or do you  attend the negotiations as representatives of two different  departments and try not to notice one another?    [Gromov] Good interaction has been worked out, in my view.  It  is easy working with him--he is a composed and thoughtful  professional.    [Starkov] Is the foreign minister a democratic individual?    [Gromov] Yes, but fairly strict also, perhaps.    [Starkov] You, more than other generals, are connected with  policy, including foreign policy. Are you thinking of continuing  your political career?    [Gromov] No.    [Starkov] It is precluded for you?    [Gromov] I am a professional military man and wish to deal  with my field.    [Starkov] Do you know any promising people in the army? Are  there such persons in the Ministry of Defense leadership?    [Gromov] Marshal Ye. Shaposhnikov declared recently on the  "Commanders" program that he does not see a single de Gaulle in  the army. There has to be. Especially since the Russian and  French armies have a great deal in common.    [Starkov] Does this mean that a military dictator could  emerge here, as in Chile?    [Gromov] De Gaulle was not a dictator, Chile is not Russia.  When I left Afghanistan, in 1989, then from 1989 through 1991,  everyone was prophesying that I would be a dictator. But I was  convinced even then that dictatorship in Russia was out of date.  At least, there are none such in the military, I believe. It is  simply that after all the recent events, a person who would  venture to assume such colossal responsibility will not be found.    [Starkov] How many are there in the Gromov family?    [Gromov] My wife and I have four children: Maksim, Andrey,  and the twin daughters Valechka and Zhenechka. The eldest,  Maksim, already has his own twins--a boy and girl. So in this  respect I am a wealthy man.    P.S. General B. Gromov's book "Limited Contingent," chapters  from which the paper intends to familiarize readers with in a  coming issue, will be published by Progress Publishers at the  start of next week.</p>

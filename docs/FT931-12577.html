			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Scientists launch new Aids appeal THE MOST ambitious effort so far to raise funds for fighting Aids will be launched in Paris today. Professor Luc Montagnier, Europe's best-known researcher into the disease, and Dr Federico Mayor, director-general of Unesco, are seeking hundreds of millions of dollars for their new World Foundation for Research and Prevention of Aids. The foundation, based at Unesco headquarters in Paris, hopes to raise money from both private and public sources to 'intensify the global struggle against Aids'. Prof Montagnier, its president, is looking for donations, such as the FFr1m (Pounds 118,000) 'seed money' given by a group of Italian banks, and for investments from companies looking to make a long-term financial return from collaborative research with the foundation. He also hopes to work with the new US administration, which has undertaken to increase spending on Aids. The foundation will set up three new centres - one in France, one in the US and one in Africa - where its scientists can follow the progress of people who are infected with HIV but who do not yet show any symptoms of Aids. One aim is to develop rapid clinical tests that could evaluate the effectiveness of new drugs more quickly than those available today. Establishing the three clinical centres and running them for five years would cost an estimated FFr930m. In addition, the foundation plans to sponsor more basic research, for example into co-factors - other viruses and bacteria which act together with HIV to cause Aids. Prof Montagnier's own laboratory in the Institut Pasteur in Paris is working intensively on research into co-factors. The first project in the foundation's programme of social work is to provide education for Ugandan orphans whose parents have died of Aids, at an estimated cost of FFr5m. Prof Montagnier says he looks forward to working more closely with Aids researchers in the US - including Dr Robert Gallo of the National Cancer Institute. The two scientists were officially credited with discovering HIV jointly in 1984, but a US government inquiry found Dr Gallo guilty early this month of misconduct in his research. 'It's time to leave all that behind us,' Prof Montagnier said. 'It has given the public a bad image of Aids research.'</p>

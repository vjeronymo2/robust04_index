"Our economy should be reformed by ourselves, not  by Russia," he declared in a televised statement Monday evening.    Nevertheless, Shushkevich conceded that a monetary union  with  Russia is capable of considerably improving the economic  situation in Belarus.    According to him, to ensure normal working of the proposed  monetary union it is necessary to fix equal prices for fuel and  basic raw materials and establish a customs union between  Belarus and Russia.    With reference to the possibility of his resignation during  the current parliamentary session, Shushkevich said he is aware  that a group of deputies intended to "raise this issue." He  would resign on his own, if he believed that the next speaker  will induce legislators to fix a date for early parliamentary  elections, Shushkevich said.</p>

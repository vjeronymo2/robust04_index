			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Germans arrest Algerian leader Mr Rabah Kebir, spokesman for the Algerian Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), was arrested in Germany yesterday on an international arrest warrant issued by an Algiers court, Francis Ghiles reports. He had escaped from house arrest in Algeria last summer, six months after national elections were suspended when it became clear the FIS was poised to win. The FIS was outlawed the following month. In a separate incident yesterday Mr Oussama Kebir, the son of the FIS leader, Mr Abassi Madani, imprisoned since June 1991 in Blida, near Algiers, was arrested elsewhere in Germany. The decision to extradite the two men, one of whom is under sentence of death in Algiers, rests with the German federal government since there is no extradition treaty between the two countries. The French authorities meanwhile have banned the FIS weekly Critere which for the past 18 months has been regularly distributed after Friday prayers in mosques throughout France. French security sources say they have arrested a number of FIS activists over the past few days.</p>

			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / The Queen's Speech: Lacklustre clash of leaders proves narrow win for Blair Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, yesterday scored a narrow victory in his first full-scale Commons clash with Mr John Major, the prime minister. In a lacklustre debate on the Queen's Speech, Mr Blair successfully fought off an ambush by backbench Conservative MPs who sought to undermine his first Commons speech as leader by repeatedly interrupting him. The Tory tactics backfired as Mr Blair dealt with the interruptions in the style of a headmaster accepting and dismissing a series of cheeky questions from the less intelligent members of the fourth form. Even the prime minister allowed himself a smile as Mr Blair joked that Mr Bob Dunn, a Tory backbencher who had admitted regularly ignoring the advice of experts, was unlucky not to have made it to the cabinet. Mr Blair focused his attack on the Conservative record on taxation and the economy, prompting irritable interventions from Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Norman Lamont, his predecessor. Mr Blair ridiculed Mr Major's decision to drop Post Office privatisation in the face of opposition from a handful of rebels. It was not in the legislative programme because 10 Tory rebels had opposed what was supported by 340 other Tory MPs, including the prime minister. He called for the Post Office to be 'liberated within the public sector'. Mr Blair derided as an empty gesture Mr Major's threat to call a general election if the European contributions bill is defeated. Mr Blair said the Queen's Speech showed that the government was 'out of touch and out of steam'. The cabinet was 'so riven by factions, buffeted by one day's headlines to the next, that it cannot address the interests of the country'. But, in a speech widely regarded as lacking inspiration, Mr Blair failed to tempt an intervention from the prime minister, or to deflect Mr Major from the main body of his prepared speech, which focused largely on Northern Ireland and Europe. Mr Major, unwisely tempted by the witty opening to Mr Blair's speech, attempted several jokes, all of which fell flat. But he was on surer ground with an attack on the opposition leader's claim to have transformed Labour. Disparaging the 'new Labour' tag developed by Mr Blair, the prime minister claimed that eight shadow cabinet members remained committed to unilateral nuclear disarmament, giving a fresh meaning to the phrase 'brothers in arms'.</p>

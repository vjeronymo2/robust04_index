			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SALZWEDEL FAILS TO FIND FOOTHOLD IN PRO LEAGUE;  </P> <P> SOCCER: TALENTED GOALKEEPER IS DISMAYED AT HIS LACK OF OPTIONS IN THE SPORT  AFTER STARRING AT CAL LUTHERAN FOR FOUR YEARS.  </P> <P> The life of a soccer star fresh out of college is not supposed to be this  difficult.  </P> <P> Former Cal Lutheran goalkeeper Dave Salzwedel had intended to earn his degree  and, with more professional soccer leagues kicking around than summer movie  sequels, sell himself to the highest bidder. He then would go on to a happy,  though obscure, career doing his favorite thing, playing soccer.  </P> <P> Not so fast.  </P> <P> The only thing more confusing than the number of soccer leagues is their  organization -- or lack of same. Soccer leagues in this country have come and  gone, multiplied and divided so frequently over the past two decades that one  almost has a better chance of resolving the national debt than fathoming  organized soccer.  </P> <P> Case in point: Salzwedel, an National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics  honorable-mention All-American at Cal Lutheran in 1988 and '89, figured he had  an outside shot at being drafted in this year's Major Indoor Soccer League  draft on July 26. Not only was he not contacted by an MISL team, Salzwedel  didn't even know when the draft was until the last minute.  </P> <P> It would be one thing if Salzwedel had not been contacted on purpose. But,  according to San Diego Sockers Coach Ron Newman, that was not the case. The  players selected in the draft are not necessarily the best available, according  to Newman.  </P> <P> "I have not heard anything about the (Cal) Lutheran goalkeeper, but that  doesn't mean he shouldn't be here," Newman said on the eve of the College  Indoor soccer showcase, an all-star game played in Baltimore the day before the  draft. "We don't have the (means) to hear about and look at all the top players  in the country. No soccer league does. That's why soccer operates at a  disadvantage in this country, and more and more kids are going to Europe."  </P> <P> Salzwedel has entertained thoughts of playing in Europe but for the time being  it is a risk he is unwilling to take. Salzwedel, who graduated last spring with  a degree in communications, currently coaches at soccer camps in Camarillo.  </P> <P> "I would jump on a plane right now for Europe if someone told me they wanted  me," said Salzwedel, a native of Thousands Oaks. "But I can't afford to do  that, especially not being certain what would happen."  </P> <P> Salzwedel's predicament comes on the heels of a career in which things came  easily for the 6-foot-1 goalie.  </P> <P> In his first collegiate game against West Coast Christian College in 1986, he  notched a shutout, the first of 10 he would record that year. In leading Cal  Lutheran to a 14-5-1 record, Salzwedel posted an 0.60 goals-against average, a  feat that he was unable to match in the following three years. In 1987, his  average climbed to a still-impressive 0.93 before topping out at 1.20 in 1988.  </P> <P> Last season, Cal Lutheran posted an 11-7-1 mark, its best since 1986, and  Salzwedel posted eight shutouts -- he finished with 30 in his college career --  and a 1.16 goals-against average. In the final match of the year, he made 19  saves against The Master's College, then ranked among the NAIA's top 20, but  his performance went for naught. The game, a 1-1 tie after regulation, finally  ended after two overtimes in a 5-2 shoot-out won by Master's.  </P> <P> "Dave Salzwedel is the best goalie, maybe the best player, to ever don a Cal  Lutheran uniform," Kingsmen assistant coach Sean Roche said.  </P> <P> His college career over, Salzwedel went to Las Cruces, New Mexico, over the  winter break as the starting goalie for the West team in the 1990 NAIA Senior  Bowl. Salzwedel reckoned he'd enjoy a couple of days under the New Mexico sun,  come back and get his degree in the spring, and then start thinking about  joining the professional soccer ranks.  </P> <P> "My main concern was getting my degree," Salzwedel said. "I thought my  professional goals would take care of themselves after I was finished with  school."  </P> <P> The problem was that the Western Soccer League, which has teams in Los Angeles  and Santa Barbara, holds its season in the spring. The Western League was  probably Salzwedel's best opportunity because of the aforementioned teams'  proximity, but the regular season ended a week and a half ago. All of which has  left Salzwedel, well, footcuffed.  </P> <P> "No one has really talked to me about playing and I haven't really talked to  anyone," Salzwedel said. "There are a lot of amateur clubs in the area, but you  can't make a living playing for them.  </P> <P> "Unless you know someone, it is really tough to hook on with a professional  team. As I have found out."  </P> <P> So if Salzwedel's popularity doesn't suddenly increase and the phone doesn't  start ringing, expect to see him back at Cal Lutheran in the fall -- as  goalkeeper coach.  </P> <P> "I was planning on being a coach down the line," Salzwedel said. "Sometimes  things work out in strange ways."  </P> <P> If the sport is professional soccer, count on it.  </P></p>

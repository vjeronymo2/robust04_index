			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / International Company News: NEC, Samsung to extend co-operation NEC of Japan and Samsung Electronics of South Korea, two of the world's largest memory chip manufacturers, plan a joint development of next-generation memory chips, expanding their existing co-operation agreements, NEC said yesterday. The two companies are aiming for an agreement by the middle of this month on a development of 256-megabit dynamic random access memory (D-Ram) chips which could cost up to Y100bn (Dollars 960m). Japanese semiconductor makers, who have superior manufacturing technology, have previously teamed up with US chip manufacturers, but are now increasingly turning to South Korea as technology there advances. Japan's leading semiconductor makers have this year begun mass producing 16-megabit D-Ram chips, and are planning to start sample shipments of 64-megabit D-Ram chips. Analysts believe that samples of the 256-megabit chips are likely to be available in 1997 or 1998. But the more advanced the semiconductor, the more expensive it is to develop, the NEC spokesman said. He said the cost of developing the 256-megabit D-Ram chip is seen 'in the tens of billions of yen'. The NEC spokesman said the accord with Samsung would spread the risk, and allow mutual supply by unifying production specifications. NEC and Samsung have already agreed to exchange information on the 256-megabit D-Ram cell structure and Samsung has asked for NEC's help in developing the logic integrated circuit, which relies heavily on process technology. Samsung is South Korea's largest semiconductor maker and, based on sales, ranked seventh in the world last year, for the first time breaking into the top 10. NEC, the world's second-largest chip maker behind Intel of the US, holds more than 50 per cent of Japan's personal computer market.</p>

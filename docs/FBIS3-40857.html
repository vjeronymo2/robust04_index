			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] London--IRNA--14 Dey--4 January--Commercial  exchanges between Iran and England declined significantly last  year and in this process the English suffered losses because  along with the reduction in Iran's imports from England, Iran's  exports to this country doubled.    Based on the latest statistics published by the English  Ministry of Commercial Industries, the value of the commercial  exchanges between this country and Iran in the first 10 months  of 1993, 9 Dey 1371 to Mehr 1372 [30 December 1992 to September  1993], declined 44 percent, decreasing in value from  &pound;[pound  sterling]1.152 billion to &pound;643 million.    During the same period Iran's exports to England increased  from &pound;116 million to &pound;226 million, a growth of 95  percent,  while Iran's imports from England declined 15 percent,  decreasing from &pound;489 million to &pound;417 million.  Consequently, Iran's trade deficit with England decreased in the  first 10 months of 1992 from about &pound;372 million to  &pound;191  million.    The increase in Iran's food exports to England is one of the  most important factors in the improvement of Iran's balance of  trade with this country. Another factor in the improvement of  Iran's balance of trade with England is the increase in the  volume of oil exports to this country. In the first six months  of 1992 the value of these exports was about &pound;50 million,  while in the first six months of the year 1993 it was more than  $125 million.</p>

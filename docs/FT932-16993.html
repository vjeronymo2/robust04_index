			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / International Company News: US breaks financing records RECORD amounts of new debt and equity were raised in the US during the first quarter of this year, as low domestic interest rates continued to fuel corporate demand for capital. Wall Street securities houses reaped the rewards of the capital markets boom, with underwriting fees breaking the Dollars 2bn barrier for the first time. According to Securities Data, the US information company that compiles the data, Merrill Lynch was once again the busiest underwriter, followed by Goldman Sachs and First Boston. In total, a record Dollars 262bn in domestic financing was raised during the first three months of this year, eclipsing the previous record of Dollars 222bn set in the opening quarter of 1992. Records were broken in almost every underwriting category. A total of Dollars 122bn in new straight corporate debt was issued during the period, due primarily to the fact that optimism about the economy and surprise at President Clinton's willingness to tackle the budget deficit kept interest rates extremely low for most of the quarter. In spite of a slow January, a record Dollars 11.5bn was raised through initial public offerings of stock as companies continued to tap the equity markets either for fresh capital, or to pay off older, more expensive debt. Even the market for junk bonds soared during the quarter, with Dollars 14.1bn in new high-yielding, low-rated corporate debt issued, up almost 80 per cent on a year earlier and well ahead of the previous record set in the second quarter of 1992. Low interest rates, investor enthusiasm for riskier but higher yielding instruments, and a greater willingness among banks to underwrite junk bonds, were the main factors behind the market's strength. International bond and equity issuance also remained strong during the quarter, with a record Dollars 114bn in stock and Eurobonds sold in the period. The two areas where records did not tumble was mortgage and asset-backed debt issuance, which was hit by the desertion of institutional investors concerned about pre-payment risk, and mergers and acquisitions activity, which remained flat compared with a year ago.</p>

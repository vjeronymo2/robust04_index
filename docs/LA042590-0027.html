			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> UC OFFICIAL ENCOURAGES EFFORT TO GET ANTELOPE VALLEY CAMPUS  </P> <P> A top University of California official Tuesday encouraged Antelope Valley  leaders to continue their efforts to land a UC campus for the fast-growing  region, but warned that any such expansion hinges on passage of Proposition 111  on the state ballot in June.  </P> <P> During an hourlong presentation at Lancaster City Hall, UC Vice President  William Baker said the Antelope Valley, along with other areas, is "certainly  high on our list of priorities" as a location for a new Southern California  campus that could open by 1999.  </P> <P> Antelope Valley leaders have been campaigning to get the new campus for the  past year. But the communities of Diamond Bar and the Santa Clarita Valley in  Los Angeles County, Palm Springs and the Coachella Valley in Riverside County  and Chula Vista in San Diego County also want the campus. Baker said no  community has an edge over any of the others.  </P> <P> Baker told about 30 civic leaders at a briefing Tuesday that the UC system  could not afford the planned expansion unless state voters approve Proposition  111, a measure that would relax state constitutional spending limits and allow  more tax money to be spent on transportation and higher education. If the  measure does not pass, Baker said, the system would have to turn away  prospective students and impose higher fees.  </P> <P> UC officials have proposed adding three new campuses -- in the northern,  central and southern regions of the state -- to handle enrollment that is  expected to grow by 56,000 students to 221,000 by 2005. The university system  now has nine campuses.  </P> <P> The UC Board of Regents decided in February to proceed first with a new campus  for the central region. The board is to decide in November whether the next  campus to be built after that would be in the north or the south. A site for  that campus could be selected by mid-1992, Baker said.  </P> <P> Baker said the Southern California campus would cost about $300 million,  require between 1,200 and 2,000 acres and ultimately serve 15,000 to 25,000  students. The Antelope Valley, with a population of about 200,000 and growing,  is projected to have sufficient population, housing, jobs and services to  support such a campus, he said.  </P> <P> Baker's stop in Lancaster was the first in a two-day series of meetings with  leaders in some of the communities vying for the new UC campus. Baker was to  meet later Tuesday with Palm Springs Mayor Sonny Bono and today with officials  in Diamond Bar and the Coachella Valley.  </P></p>

			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / TUC calls for Pounds 600m for training and jobs THE GOVERNMENT was urged by trade unions yesterday to spend Pounds 600m on measures to tackle unemployment, ahead of official figures today that are expected to show that the number of jobless has risen for the 28th consecutive month. The Trades Union Congress drew attention to a recent analysis by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), showing that Britain lagged behind most European Community nations in developing labour market measures to tackle joblessness. The TUC wants the government to restore the budgets of Training and Enterprise Councils, which administer training in England and Wales, and also to develop temporary employment programmes. Separately, Mr Bill Jordan, president of the AEEU engineering and electrical union, called on the TUC and the Confederation of British Industry to seek a meeting with the prime minister to urge measures to halt economic decline. The TUC said Britain was ranked ninth out of 12 EC countries in the OECD analysis in terms of the percentage of national income spent on training, temporary work programmes and job subsidies. Spending an estimated 0.56 per cent of national income last year, Britain ranked only just above Portugal and Greece. Five EC countries spent nearly twice as much as Britain. Mr Norman Willis, TUC general secretary, said Britain's job record was a 'cause for national shame'. He added: 'At a time when the government should be taking action to cut the dole queues, all it appears to be doing is stoking up rumours about reducing the benefit of the growing number of long-term unemployed.' Today's figures are expected to show that the unemployment figure for June of 2.72m rose by a further 25,000 in July. Mr John Major has held the first meeting of a UK prime minister with Civil Service union leaders since 1984, it emerged yesterday. The discussion at 10 Downing Street, which came after the government restricted pay rises for high-salaried public servants, is seen by unions as evidence that Mr Major is taking a less hostile approach to them than his predecessor. The last meeting between a prime minister and Civil Service unions came when the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher defended the union ban at the Government Communications Headquarters, Cheltenham. According to the monthly journal of the FDA civil servants association, Mr Major told general secretaries of the FDA, IPMS and NUCPS unions on July 29 that he regretted the decision to cut rises of up to 24 per cent, as recommended by the top salaries review body, to 4 per cent. However, he said many individuals had had pay rises of below 4 per cent and others had received pay cuts.</p>

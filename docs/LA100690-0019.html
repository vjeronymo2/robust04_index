			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP BEAT: IAN ASTBURY: FORCE BEHIND 'A GATHERING OF THE TRIBES';  </P> <P> FESTIVAL: THE CULT'S LEAD SINGER IS BRINGING TOGETHER A DIVERSE ROSTER OF ROCK,  RAP AND POP ACTS FOR A TWO-CITY CONCERT.  </P> <P> You've probably played that little game of dreaming up the perfect concert, the  one with all your favorite acts on one bill regardless of genre.  </P> <P> Ian Astbury of the Cult has.  </P> <P> "I was sitting in the front of the tour bus one day with my notebook, thinking,  'Wouldn't it be great if I could take the records in my collection and see a  festival with some of the best acts?'," the English singer recalled recently in  his manager's Beverly Hills office. "Why not an event where you could see all  this great music?"  </P> <P> But where most people's fantasies remain just that, Astbury's dream is coming  true. He's the force behind "A Gathering of the Tribes," a two-city/two-day  festival bringing a diverse roster of rock, rap and pop acts -- and their  audiences -- together, first today at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in the Bay  Area, and Sunday at the Pacific Amphitheatre in Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> Among the performers: rockers Iggy Pop, the London Quireboys and former Sex  Pistol Steve Jones, rappers Public Enemy, Ice-T and Queen Latifah and the  folk-oriented Michelle Shocked and the Indigo Girls.  </P> <P> Astbury, an amiably chatty 28-year-old from Birkenhead, a town across the  Mersey River from Liverpool, explained that as he discussed his vision with  associates earlier this year, he was only expressing a fantasy.  </P> <P> "It's a quality of life thing," he said. "I thought it would be great to put a  diverse bill together and see if it could happen and introduce all the  segregate groups to each other. But it was nothing more than conversation,  really."  </P> <P> But the Cult's agent, Bill Ellison, mentioned the idea to others, including  promoter Bill Graham, who operates the Shoreline Amphitheatre, and Alex Hodges  of the Nederlander organization, which runs the Pacific Amphitheatre.  </P> <P> "Bill came back to me and said, 'Your festival's on,' " Astbury said. "I said,  'What do you mean?' . . .  </P> <P> "I had one vision and any excuse was not good enough," Astbury said. "Guns N'  Roses should be doing it, but can't due to commitments. Tracy Chapman should be  doing it. Living Colour, Ziggy Marley, Julian Lennon should be doing it."  </P> <P> Still, the lineup's diversity, Astbury believes, is enough to affirm his prime  directive: "Us and them doesn't exist any more." The music will be supplemented  by an appearance by the American Indian Dance Theatre and representation from  various environmental and social-activist groups.  </P> <P> One act conspicuous in its absence is Astbury's own.  </P> <P> "I didn't want the Cult to play because I didn't want people to think we were  using this to boost our career," Astbury explained.  </P> <P> He does, however, plan to jam with Jones and perhaps one or two other acts.  After all, he put together these shows as a fan, not as an artist.  </P> <P> "One of the selfish reasons of having it was to see these acts perform," he  said.  </P> <P> Still Tossin': The song "Tossin' and Turnin' " has one of rock's great  openings. Bobby Lewis' leering delivery of the line "I couldn't sleep at all  last night" proved as much a grabber when imitated in a recent breakfast cereal  commercial as when the original held the No. 1 spot on the pop singles chart  for seven straight weeks in 1961.  </P> <P> But few would guess that in chart terms the song was the No. 3 biggest hit of  the '60s, just behind the Beatles' "Hey Jude" and Percy Faith's "The Theme From  'A Summer Place'." That will be one of the songs heard as the Legends of Rock  'n' Roll two-night stand at the Greek Theatre concludes tonight, as Lewis makes  his first Los Angeles appearance in nearly 20 years.  </P> <P> "It means I've always got something to stick my chest out for," said Lewis, 62,  who now lives in Newark, New Jersey. "And something to thank the mighty first  God for."  </P></p>

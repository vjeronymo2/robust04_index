			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Pavel Vanichkin and Vitaliy </F> Chukseyev]    [Text] Washington, 9 Mar -- Tuesday [9 March] was a busy  and intense day on Capitol Hill for the Russian State Duma  delegation which is visiting the U.S. capital at the invitation  of the U.S. Congress. The Russian parliamentarians, headed by  Ivan Rybkin, chairman of the State Duma, held meetings and talks  with the leaders of the Senate, George Mitchell and Robert Dole,  and with Senators Sam Nunn and Richard Lugar. They visited the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee, whose chairman is Claiborne  Pell. The speaker of the House of Representatives, Thomas  Foley, gave an official luncheon in honor of the Russian  delegation.    ITAR-TASS correspondents asked a member of the delegation,  Vladimir Lukin, who is chairman of the Duma's international  affairs committee and a former Russian ambassador to the United  States, to comment on yesterday's talks, which were held behind  closed doors. He said that a wide range of issues, including  both international problems and the state of our economy and  budget, were discussed. There was especially great interest in  the economic situation in Russia at the meeting with the Senate  Foreign Relations Committee. A thorough discussion on Bosnia  took place. We agreed to coordinate our actions better within  the framework of partnership, i.e. coordinating our steps first,  then acting, rather than the other way round. On the whole the  talks were constructive, there was no suggestion of  confrontation, irritation and so on. We have now reached the  stage of mature partnership, we have moved on from the days when  we agreed in advance to what anyone told us. This fact  naturally creates some nervousness here.    In addition to the meetings in Congress, the State Duma  delegation also visited the Pentagon, where it was received by  U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry. Bearing in mind that the  delegation was invited by Congress, wasn't this merely a  courtesy call, the ITAR-TASS correspondents asked. No, replied  V. Lukin. We were met by a solid team and there were solid  talks about problems which concern them - ratification of  fundamental treaties, including START-2, accession to the  convention on chemical weapons, and open skies.    The ITAR-TASS correspondents asked how united was the  position of the Russian parliamentary delegation, given its lack  of political homogeneity. V. Lukin said that in his view there  are really only two groupings in the Duma. One is geared to  constructive and professional work on ending the crisis and to  cooperation with all branches of power. The other is interested  in chaos. Our delegation, he stressed, was made up entirely of  representatives of the first grouping, and the shades of  difference between us were secondary. Our prime motivation was  to show our American partners that we hail from a single state,  that we are Russian patriots and that we are upholding our  country's interests, rather than settling internal scores.    The talks and meetings were also attended by Sergey Glazyev,  Sergey Yushenkov, Mikhail Zadornov and Galina Klimantova, who  are all chairmen of State Duma committees.</p>

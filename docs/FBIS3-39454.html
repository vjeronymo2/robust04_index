After a five-hour meeting,  Interior Minister Manfred Kanther said that due to the difficult  economic situation in Croatia, and in order to give the state an  appropriate period of time to look after those returning, the  repatriation to "pacified regions" in Croatia would be extended.    This means that refugees from areas occupied and destroyed  by  the Serbs can stay in Germany up to 30 June 1995. The  repatriation of childless married couples, or single, childless  adults, will begin on 1 May, and will be finished by 31 October.    The interior ministers pointed out, however, that the  refugees' stay in Germany could only be a temporary one. The  Federal Government should be asked to discuss the best possible  solution to the repatriation problem with the Croat Government  as soon as possible.</p>

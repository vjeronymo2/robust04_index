			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Grigoriy Selyaninov under the "CIS Integration" </F> rubric: "Russia May Find Itself Once Again Confined to Ruble  Zone"]    [Text] Explaining his refusal to join the government  currently under reorganization, Yegor Gaydar cited among other  things the threat of returning to the situation of 1992, when  there was an inflation competition among 12 centers of money  creation in the ruble zone. The fears are not without reason.  The issue is in the first place the unprecedented preparations  for the merger of the money systems of Russia and Belarus, which  KOMMERSANT-DAILY reported 12 January. Meanwhile, Andrey Kozyrev  has also joined in the Russian Government fray over economic  integration. In his message to the president the Russian  Foreign Ministry chief argues against both Russia's  "isolationism" in economic relations with the former USSR  republics, and the stepped-up resuscitation of the ruble zone.  The general balance of forces within the government, however, is  unfavorable for the ruble so far.    Uncertainty and political infighting in the top echelons of  the Russian executive branch have prompted candidates for the  leading roles in the cabinet to issue statements that go beyond  the scope of their current powers. In his address to the  president, Andrey Kozyrev supports integration within the CIS in  principle. He believes that Russia can overcome the economic  crisis only jointly with the other former USSR republics. On  the other hand, Andrey Kozyrev's statement contains a provision  saying that the formation of the CIS economic union is running  too far ahead. The union is being hastily equipped with  documents describing the final stage of economic integration.  In other words, the Foreign Ministry chief is diplomatically  objecting to the stepped-up creation of a currency union,  especially in the form of a ruble zone.    The foreign minister's statement can also be interpreted as  follows: While wishing to stay on in the government, Andrey  Kozyrev is distancing himself in advance from its fairly likely  decisions in favor of the ruble zone's comeback, which may  undermine the prospects for Russia's financial convalescence.    On the whole, the balance of forces in the government with  regard to resuscitating the ruble zone does not appear to be  favoring the ruble. If Boris Fedorov follows Yegor Gaydar's  suit in compliance with decisions by "Russia's Choice" ruling  bodies, there will be no radical market advocates opposing the  ruble zone's revival left in the government. Given that  regarding this subject the Central Bank sticks to a view that  priority should be given to restoring interrepublican economic  ties, not to propping up the ruble, then 1994 may mark a return  to a situation of two years ago in terms of Russia's subsidizing  former Union republics. Meanwhile, according to available  estimates, a total of 8 percent of Russian GDP was siphoned off  into the republics in 1992, and 25 percent of Russia's price  growth was caused by the inflationary dumping of rubles into  Russia from the CIS countries. The year 1993 saw only the  beginning in switching economic and especially credit and  financial relations to market principles (by using the  indexation of Russian Government credits through the current  exchange rate of the dollar, setting interest rates on the basis  of LIBOR [London Interbank Offered Rate], and making insurance  currency deposits). Nonetheless, Russia gave its CIS partners  credits to the tune of 5.2 trillion rubles in settling trade  accounts.

Aleksandr Shokhin signed the 28 December Russian-Belarusian  protocol on the readiness to merge the two countries' money  systems. He sees the draft agreement prepared by the Central  Banks of Russia and Belarus "On the Mechanism of Operation of  Belarus' Money System Upon Merging it With That of Russia" as  acceptable.    Vladimir Mashits holds a wait-and-see stance. He favors a  stepped-up creation of a multi-currency payment union of CIS  countries, but he does not object to the ruble zone, either.</p>

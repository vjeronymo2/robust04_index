			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Outdoors: The SL, a symphony in heavy metal - Motoring The 50-year-old Dakota, smelling like all old aeroplanes of petrol, oil and the passage of time, had taken off from Biggin Hill airfield in Kent, immortalised by the Battle of Britain. Close to an hour later, it rolled to a standstill on the grass of Swanton Morley. I jumped out, walked across to an open-topped Mercedes-Benz 320SL, and drove it away down the kind of track makers use to test cars to destruction. At 35-40mph (56-64kph), nothing shook, banged or creaked. For all the notice the Mercedes took of the potholes and bumps, it could have been an average B-road in Britain. Why the trip by veteran aircraft to a former second world war bomber base in East Anglia? First, to make the point that the SL has been around for a very long time; the type name originated 40 years ago with the 300SL and its unusual gull-wing doors. Second, because the roads in East Anglia are almost traffic-free compared with those of the overcrowded south-east. With the sun shining, it was just the place for wind in the hair motoring. The SL stands for superlicht (super-light) although, over many years, these cars always have struck me as anything but. At close to two tons ready for the road, the latest 320SL is a fairly massive piece of machinery; almost a battle tank designer's idea of a sports car. But its carved-from-solid integrity makes it the strongest, stiffest and safest open car in the world. It even has a rollover bar deployed automatically in a fraction of a second if a sensor detects that the car is in danger of overturning. This really works. When the present SL was launched five years ago in Portugal, a girl who should not have been at the wheel up-ended one at speed on a race track. The car looked distinctly second-hand afterwards, but she and her passenger walked away. To get an SL into such a predicament, however, calls for bad luck or inept driving. Although it rides like a town carriage, its wide track and sophisticated suspension give it levels of handling and road-holding so high that they simply cannot be explored on the highway. The SL has always been the choice of affluent motoring connoisseurs and their ladies. Many of the owners are no longer young; indeed, it is the kind of car to which a man might turn naturally on feeling he had grown too old for a Porsche 911. Although a cabriolet version of the gull-wing appeared in 1960, I reckon the latest blood line began with the 'pagoda top' 300SL of 1963 - the one with a slightly concave roof. Its replacement in 1971 stayed in production until the present car appeared 18 years later, in 1989. Since then, more than 106,000 have been made, more than half with five-litre, V8 engines. Mercedes-Benz murmurs that this is because 'our customers have a liking for power'. Britons, undaunted by the recession, have bought more than 5,000 of them and sales now are even more buoyant. SLs come with in-line, six-cylinder engines of 2.8 and 3.2 litres; the five-litre V8; or a six-litre V12 at prices ranging from Pounds 53,594 to Pounds 96,794. All have automatic transmission. Orders are being taken for a very limited 'hot' edition with a bored-out six-litre V8, special AMG suspension and ultra-wide wheels. It will cost between Pounds 85,000 and Pounds 90,000. I doubt I would like driving that one as much as I did the 320SL. This has a silk-smooth six-cylinder (231 horsepower at 5,800rpm) which, I thought, gave it more than enough performance. Foot down hard, the 308hp 500SL I tried later was more rocket-like, but the extra weight up front made it handle less sensitively. All SLs have a power-operated hood and a hard top which you keep in the garage until winter sets in. The soft top is a masterpiece. It disappears completely when folded and is the only one I know that is totally automatic, even to the operation of the clamps that fasten it.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Hisham Milhim dispatch from Washington] </F>   [Excerpt] The Governments of Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan  have decided to suspend bilateral peace negotiations with Israel  in Washington before the end of the last week of talks on  Wednesday. This decision is to put on record their vehement  denunciation of the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and to express  their solidarity with the Palestinian people.    Syrian delegation head Muwaffaq al-'Allaf communicated this  united Arab stand to peace negotiations coordinator Dennis Ross  on Sunday afternoon.    Al-'Allaf told Radio Monte Carlo: In light of the  circumstances resulting from the massacre, we found that it is  not logical or suitable to pursue the negotiations. We also  want to express our solidarity with the Palestinian people after  this barbaric attack.    The suspension of negotiations takes place three days before  they were scheduled to end.

			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Domnick Hunter to raise Pounds 16m The flotation of Domnick Hunter is expected to raise about Pounds 16m in new money for the north-east of England-based engineering group which claims to be a world leader in filtration products. The flotation, by way of a placing, will give the group a market capitalisation of about Pounds 60m. It is expected that impact day will be March 16 and that dealings will start on March 29. Of the net proceeds, about Pounds 9.9m will be used to redeem preference shares and Pounds 5.4m will be used to reduce group borrowings. The group has a dominant role in the UK compressed air filter market, and exports more than 60 per cent of sales to 40 countries. Last year it made operating profits of some Pounds 4.7m on turnover of Pounds 30.6m. A pathfinder prospectus was published yesterday.</p>

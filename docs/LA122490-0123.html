			<p><P> December 24, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> 'BONFIRE' HARD ON WHITES: HANKS  </P> <P> Actor Tom Hanks says charges of racism in "The Bonfire of the Vanities" may be  misdirected because the movie hits rich, white people most of all.  </P> <P> "I didn't worry much about the racist angle," he said.  </P> <P> "The story is hard on everybody, probably hardest of all on the white Park  Avenue types."  </P> <P> Director Brian DePalma ran into considerable community opposition while making  the movie, particularly from blacks.  </P> <P> In an interview published Sunday in The Tennessean, Hanks said he was "bracing  to hear from the Southern belle lobbyists. My mistress in the movie is not a  very flattering example of Southern womanhood."  </P> <P> The star of "Splash," "Dragnet" and "Big" said that the offer from DePalma to  play selfish yuppie Sherman McCoy came as a surprise and that he thought the  offer was a joke.  </P></p>

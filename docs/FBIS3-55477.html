He has  had a meeting with Geydar Aliyev, the president of Azerbaijan.  Aliyev noted that active fighting is in progress at the moment,  but it was not initiated by the Azerbaijani side. For a month  now, he said, plans are being hatched for the annexation of  further Azerbaijani land. Addressing Fedor Reut, the president  called on the Russian side to promote a peaceful settlement of  the question of Azerbaijan's territorial integrity. Aliyev also  asked for help in defending the 600,000-strong Azerbaijani  community in Georgia, which is being subjected to attack by  criminal elements. That was a report from the ANI news agency.</p>

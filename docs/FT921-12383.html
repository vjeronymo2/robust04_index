			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / Lengthening Guinness trial to be adjourned again this week THE SECOND Guinness trial, in which former merchant bankers Mr Roger Seelig and Lord Spens deny fraud and false accounting, has progressed only 2 1/2 days since December 20, when it was adjourned for Christmas, Raymond Hughes writes. The trial, halted since January 15 by a juror's illness, is expected to resume at Southwark Crown Court in London today. It will be adjourned again on Friday, the judge having decided some time ago that the jury should have the first week of February off. Only 10 of the 80 potential prosecution witnesses have so far given evidence and the case is thought likely to last well into the summer. When the case opened in September it was expected to last three months. In early December, though, Mr Justice Henry told the jury it might last until Easter 'and I can't give you a copper-bottomed, 100 per cent guarantee that it will have finished by then'. Within little more than two hours of the trial's resumption on January 6 a juror became too unwell to continue. There were no further sittings that week because Mr Seelig, who is conducting his own defence, was suffering from the side-effects of medicine prescribed for treatment he started after Christmas. The effect on Mr Seelig of the strain of the lengthening proceedings is another imponderable hanging over the trial. Not all the non-jury days have been wasted. Many hours have been spent in legal argument that might otherwise have delayed sessions in the presence of the jury. The whole of the Serious Fraud Office's prosecution arising from Guinness's Pounds 2.7bn takeover battle for Distillers in 1986 is not expected to be completed much before the end of this year. After Mr Justice Henry has completed Guinness Two, he will preside over Guinness Three, in which the defendant is Mr David Mayhew of Cazenove, Guinness's broker during the takeover. Guinness Four is to start at the Old Bailey before Mr Justice Turner in September and is expected to last four to six weeks. That action concerns Mr Thomas Ward, a US attorney who was a Guinness non-executive director at the time of the battle for Distillers. Allowing for appeals, the process might last until early next year - seven years after the original events.</p>

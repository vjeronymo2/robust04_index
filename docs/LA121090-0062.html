			<p><P> December 10, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> More State Trucking Firms Failing: The number of trucking company failures in  California rose 11% the first three quarters of 1990, reversing a four-year  downward trend, according to Dunn &amp; Bradstreet.  </P> <P> About 130 carriers failed the first nine months, up from 117 last year. If the  trend continues, there will be 175 failures this year, more than in any year  since 1986, according to the California Trucking Assn. Last year there were 157  failures. Carriers operating in the Los Angeles basin, where environmental  regulation is strictest, are among the most vulnerable to failure, the  association said.  </P></p>

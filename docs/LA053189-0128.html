			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> JAPANESE FOREIGN MINISTER UNO TO SUCCEED TAKESHITA  </P> <P> Foreign Minister Sosuke Uno agreed today to become Japan's next prime minister,  at the behest of a governing party crippled by scandal and divided by the  choice.  </P> <P> The Liberal Democrats turned to Uno, 66, after elder statesman Masayoshi Ito  refused the job.  </P> <P> Uno was attending a meeting in Paris and agreed by telephone, apparently with  some reluctance, to become head of the party and to replace Prime Minister  Noboru Takeshita.  </P> <P> Ryutaro Hashimoto, deputy secretary-general of the party, appeared at a news  conference and quoted Uno as saying: "I am not confident I can handle the job  when the party is facing such a difficult time, but now that the party is in an  unprecedented crisis I will commit myself for the party."  </P> <P> Hashimoto said party leaders decided Uno was "currently the most-suited  candidate as successor" to Takeshita. The prime minister is resigning to take  responsibility for the Recruit influence-buying scandal, which stained the top  ranks of politics, business and the bureaucracy.  </P> <P> Opposition within the party indicated Uno may have a difficult time even if he  gets the expected approval from Parliament, where the Liberal Democrats have a  large majority.  </P> <P> Some oppose the foreign minister because he is a senior member of the party  faction of former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, during whose tenure in  1982-87 the scandal developed.  </P> <P> "I am outraged by this nonsense of giving the country's highest office, which  only one person can assume, to a sort of managing director of the Nakasone  company," former Prime Minister Takeo Fukuda told reporters. "I am totally  amazed."  </P> <P> Fukuda, 84, had lobbied against Uno. His own name was one of many mentioned as  possible candidates during the long search.  </P> <P> Tsuruo Yamaguchi, secretary-general of the Japan Socialist Party, the largest  opposition group, said: "The Recruit scandal involved corruption during  Yasuhiro Nakasone's administration. It is . . . a violent act to appoint one of  Nakasone's aides as the next prime minister."  </P></p>

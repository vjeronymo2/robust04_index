			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / US Mid-Term Elections (November 8): Tax vote turns off Philadelphia suburbs - An account which Montgomery County's wealthy aim to settle Even before Congresswoman Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky cast the 218th and deciding vote for President Bill Clinton's budget in 1993, she was the Republican party's top target for the November 8 congressional elections. Two years ago, she became the first Democrat since 1916 to represent her generally conservative district in Montgomery county, west of Philadelphia, winning by just 1,373 votes. But 'the 218th vote' for a budget that raised taxes on high incomes seemed sure to doom her in these wealthy Philadelphia suburbs, where registered Republicans outnumber registered Democrats two to one. Sure enough, Ms Margolies-Mezvinsky is trailing in her battle for re-election. But she is ecstatic about a local opinion poll that shows her winning 32 per cent of the vote against 39 per cent for Mr Jon Fox, the Republican county commissioner whom she defeated in 1992 and who is her opponent again this year. 'I should be 40 points down,' she said after a raucous public debate with Mr Fox and two independent candidates near the county seat of Norristown this week. The results show that even in the most hopeless of districts a good Democratic candidate with a strong campaign can stay within reach. They also show that, despite the Republicans' confident predictions that they are on the verge of taking over both the Senate and the House of Representatives, the Democrats' weakness is not the Republicans' strength. 'I voted for Marjorie last election and she was a total letdown. She didn't represent me on any of the issues I was concerned about,' complains Mr Chris Zabala, who was particularly outraged by her vote to ban assault guns. But Mr Zabala plans to vote for the Libertarian candidate, Mr Lee Hustead, who wants to abolish most of the US government, starting with the Federal Reserve, the Department of Health and Social Security and the Department of Education. 'Republicans and Democrats - I've had it with them,' he scoffed. Mr Bob Sambrick of Norristown also plans to vote Libertarian. 'I'm looking for a candidate that's going to be for the people, and I haven't found one yet. I'm going Libertarian - any other vote except Republican or Democrat,' he said. Yet the howls of anger against the political status quo seem unlikely to translate into solid political results. There are surprising numbers of self-proclaimed Libertarians on the streets of Norristown or Conshohocken, old industrial towns along the Schuylkill river with many of the problems of urban decay faced on a larger scale by nearby Philadelphia, but more scientific polling shows Mr Hustead winning just 4 per cent of the vote. Nevertheless, 22 per cent of those questioned in this week's poll for the KYW radio and television stations said they were still undecided, and 40 per cent of those who expected to vote for Mr Fox were still not certain they would do so. In a surprisingly large number of districts across the country, Republicans have chosen candidates who are poorly positioned to exploit the Democrats' weakness. Some, like Mr Fox, are professional politicians ill-equipped to capitalise on voters' general frustration with politics as usual. Ms Margolies-Mezvinsky's television advertisements hit hard at the fact that Mr Fox has run for office 10 times in the past 15 years, and has run for four offices in the past four years. Others, like Mr Rick Santorum, the Republican congressman who is trying to unseat Mr Harris Wofford, Pennsylvania's Democratic senator, are sufficiently extreme in their views to alienate a good number of voters in the middle. While Mr Santorum's opposition to even the most minimal controls on assault guns may play well in parts of the state, he stands well to the right of Republicans who have in the past won statewide elections in Pennsylvania, such as Senator Arlen Specter. In Montgomery county, too, the two candidates are divided by gun control. Ms Margolies-Mezvinsky's support for a ban on assault guns wins her votes in wealthy suburbs like Narberth and Bryn Mawr, clustered along the Main Line railway into Philadelphia, and among Republican women who were crucial to her victory in 1992. The National Rifle Association's endorsement of Mr Fox carries more weight further out in semi-rural areas like Skippack and Whitpain, where walled condominium housing developments with guards at their gates are sprouting among the horse paddocks and pumpkin fields. But Ms Margolies-Mezvinsky still faces an uphill struggle if she is to confound the Republican congressmen who chanted 'Goodbye Marjorie' as she cast the '218th vote' for Mr Clinton's budget last year.</p>

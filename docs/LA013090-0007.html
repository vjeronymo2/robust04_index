			<p><P> January 30, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CARSON MUST DIP INTO SAVINGS TO MEET BUDGET  </P> <P> Carson will have to take $5.5 million from its reserves to meet a $34.8-million  budget that three council members approved last week, since revenues are  projected to be only $29.3 million.  </P> <P> The budget, which was passed with the fiscal year more than half over, will  leave the city with reserves of only $2 million.  </P> <P> However, the city expects to begin receiving $1 million during the next fiscal  year from special revenues allocated by the Legislature to cities with low  property taxes or none.  </P> <P> The plan represents a 16% increase over last year's budget. A major increase  came in the $2.2-million capital budget, much of which is to go for  construction in Veterans Park.  </P></p>

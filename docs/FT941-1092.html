			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Savers abandon building societies for unit trusts - At a Glance Money continued to pour into unit trusts as savers deserted the building societies last month. Net sales of unit trusts rose to Pounds 722.4m last month, Pounds 530m of which was private investors' money, according to the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds. Meanwhile, the Building Societies Association reported a net outflow of Pounds 404m in February. Among the most popular unit trust sectors were the five Pep-qualifying UK equity sectors, which attracted Pounds 335m between them, illustrating the rush to use up Pep allowances before the tax year ends. International growth funds were also popular. The unit trust industry had Pounds 98.9bn under management at the end of February. The marketing drive is set to continue as more funds are still looking to pull in new money - see table on page X.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["grd"-signed report: "`Close Down All Nuclear Power </F> Plants'"]    [Excerpt] Hamburg -- Lower Saxony, Schleswig-Holstein, and  Hamburg want to renounce nuclear power. This was agreed at a  meeting in Hamburg by minister-presidents Gerhard Schroeder,  Heide Simonis, and Mayor Henning Voscherau (all Social  Democratic Party). The three laender are planning to coordinate  their future energy policies within the "regional development  concept." This will include closing down all nuclear power  plants, Schroeder said.    The three heads of government have, however, not yet agreed  on a date for opting out of nuclear power. "We do not want to  pressure ourselves," Schroeder said. Specific steps can be  expected next year. There will be talks with the major power  suppliers in northern Germany over the next few months, where  economically feasible alternatives to nuclear power will be  discussed. Voscherau and Schroeder did not say which  alternatives they have in mind. Ms Simonis indicated, however,  that a more intense use of coal would be the obvious choice.  She urged the other laender to close down their nuclear power  plants as well. "Quitting nuclear power can only be successful,  if all laender join in." [passage omitted]</p>

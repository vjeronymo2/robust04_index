			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The government is in the process of actively  considering taking strong measures by mobilizing all possible  means, including handing this issue over to the UN Security  Council and imposing sanctions on North Korea, if North Korea  does not respond to an additional inspection by the  International Atomic Energy Agency and the South-North exchange  of special envoys.    In a news conference on the afternoon of 17 March, Kim  Sam-hun, nuclear ambassador of the Foreign Ministry, revealed  such a policy by saying that the government has strong doubts on  whether it should continue its dialogue efforts with North Korea  and if that is possible at all. He also stated that now is the  time to take all possible proper steps.    In connection with resolving North Korea's nuclear issue, he  said that the government's policy on the North Korean nuclear  issue maintained the basic framework of peaceful resolution  through dialogue in the past. However, the government's policy  revealed today is very noteworthy because it hints that the  government's policy on North Korea will turn to strong measures,  including sanctions.</p>

			<p>Cost   of Colored Region to 1/2 that of Pigment Dispersion Method   <F P=102> 94FE0437A Tokyo NIKKEI MICRODEVICES in Japanese Mar 94 pp  86-87 ---FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY </F>  <F P=103> 94FE0437A </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo NIKKEI MICRODEVICES </F> <F P=105>  Japanese </F> CSO     [Text] Mitsumura Printing has developed a low cost and high  precision color filter for printing. Manufacturing cost of color  layers is half that of the pigment dispersion method.  Previously, color printing was done one color at time, but this  new method can print three colors at once. It is said that this  method reduces print defects caused by particles. Sample  shipments will start from the summer of 1994, and the company  will actively sell to TFT panel makers.    It is expected that the color filter printing method will  reduce manufacturing cost since it does not require a  lithography process. On the other hand, since the resolution is  low, it was thought that this printing method was not suitable  for high resolution TFT panels. The color filter printing method  that Mitsumura Printing has developed this time increased the  resolution, and even some panel makers are saying, ``it changes  the concept of printing.''    In traditional printing methods, flattening and the  formation of direct lines were not fully satisfactory. In  addition, there was a frequent problem of defects caused by  particles. The main reason for the defects is because each color  is printed separately and dries, and then next color is layered  on the dried print. The layered part becomes dense in the film,  so that it is difficult to flatten the surface. Furthermore  since a roller is used to transfer ink, the edge becomes wavy.  <H5>  Print Three Colors Simultaneously Leaving Gap </H5>   The new method uses offset printing, three colors are  printed simultaneously. For this reason manufacturing cost is  reduced (see figure 1), and high resolution printing is  improved. On each of RGB print boards, a roller shaped blanket  body is rotated, and three colors of ink are transferred onto  the surface of one blanket (see figure 2). At this time, a 10  m gap is spaced between each color.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-025L-16A>      Figure 1. Cost Comparison In Color Area Using Color Filter </FIG>    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-025L-17A>      Figure 2. Color Filter Manufacturing Process In Each Method </FIG>     This blanket is pressed hard to the glass baseboard,  rotated, and each color is transferred. At the same time  following the blanket, a second roller is rotated, which presses  and spreads each color onto the baseboard, and flattens. Ink  pressed from the top is packed, filling the gap, so ``flattening  and edge linearity are improved.'' said the R&amp;D manager of  Mitsumura Printing. Flatness and direct line formation are  improved to less than 0.15 m and 5 m respectively  which is  less than half that produced by the traditional method (see  table 1 and figure 3).       -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1.

View Of Traditional Printing Method And New </FIG>     Also, the flat board made by A1 was corrected, and  dimensional precision was improved. It is said that correction  is possible between 5-50 m. At present the printing method  employed by Toppan Printing Company which is a competitor, has  difficulty with correction since the board is glass, and  manufacturing cost is higher by 2 digits. Moreover, simultaneous  three color printing is, Rprincipally difficult since ink gets  mixed,S said the manager of R&amp;D at Mitsumura Printing.  <H5>  Production Capacity Increased By 25% </H5>   From calculations, a 25% improvement in production  line  capacity is estimated by using 3 color simultaneous printing.  Improved operation idling and efficiency result from reducing  the printing machines from three units to one unit, and particle  generation as well as machine failure in the overall process are  reduced.    However, the number of rollers per unit increases three  times, and tack time per piece will be longer. By Mitsumura  Printing's estimate, if one color operation is involved,  operational efficiency is 50%, idling is 65%, and  tack time is  30 seconds; and if the three color operation is employed, the  values are 60%, 75%, and 60 seconds respectively.</p>

			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Fashion: Simply made to measure . . . perfectly - Linda Watson opts for bespoke tailoring when a good fit is hard to find Call me old-fashioned, but I like fashion that fits. I like shoulders to flatter, the sleeves to skim my wrists, the waist to meet mine. All I ask of a jacket is that it allows me to stretch, bend, and cross my arms without fear of asphyxiation or the buttons flying off. Maybe I am asking too much: at a mere 5ft, I am a size 10 across the shoulders, a 12 across the bust, a 14 around the hips. As a result of this odd - but not rare - anatomical equation the past five years have been spent in pursuit of the perfect jacket. There comes a point in every woman's life when she must concede defeat: in the eyes of the fashion industry Ms Average is around 5ft 6in, with a beanpole physique. Although an alarming 47 per cent of Britain's female population is size 16 or over, it is not simply a question of weight - but the distribution of it - which causes headaches for high street retailers. Millions of individual nuances in height and shape are the root cause of our clothes not fitting properly. To some extent this is catered for in specialist sub-sections, namely the outsize, the tall, and the petite. But what happens when a few of these categories merge? Pity the small curvy woman, the tall outsize shape or anyone else who does not fall neatly into mass market statistics. Ironically, for all the technological advances in clothingmanufacturing, around 50 years ago this problem did not exist. Firstly, I would have been in the majority (Ms Average circa 1940 was shorter and curvier - no wonder original utility jackets have always fitted me like a dream), but more importantly this was the era before mass manufacturing. When people were not making their own clothes, they bought made-to-measure. Today there seems to be a psychological barrier against made-to-measure. For many, the art of choosing clothes is frequently squeezed in hastily during a busy day's appointments. Lycra has a lot to answer for. How many women, I wonder, are regularly purchasing leggings or stretch velour trousers (easy to wash and just as easy to wear) instead of the tailored ones? But elasticated fabrics and frenetic lifestyles cannot be solely to blame. Harry Sargeant, one of the shrinking number of bespoke tailors and a member of the Federation of Merchant Tailors, says: 'We've become incredibly lazy about the way we dress. It isn't enough just to be willing to spend more, you must take a keen interest in your figure, have a feel for fabrics and know what clothes can actually do for you. A certain amount of imagination is required.' But it is not just jackets which are a problem - it can apply to any clothing item which requires an element of fit. To be fair, the high street retailer has met us half way. In-store alterations are more widespread than ever. But these can only go so far. Any nips and tucks carried out at the point of sale only tackle basic discrepancies - shortening or lengthening sleeves, narrowing or extending a shoulderline. What they will not do is change the structure  - re-align a waist point, re-cut a sleeve, reshape a collar. Contrary to popular belief, bespoke tailoring is not a no- go area for women. While any tailor will tell you men make up the majority of their business, many have a small percentage of female clients. Women often assume that custom-made clothing means outlandish prices. In fact, it often costs much the same as up-market, off-the-peg labels. A pure wool coat (with a small percentage of cashmere) at Jaeger, for example, will cost around Pounds 400. A bespoke tailor (not on Savile Row) will charge you around Pounds 350. Even a top-of-the-range ladies cashmere overcoat, from Huntsman of Savile Row, is Pounds 2,836. Its mass-produced counterpart averages between Pounds 1,000 and Pounds 2,000. Although tailors work on a one-to-one basis - effectively cutting out the middleman and the usual 100 per cent mark up - their profit margin is minimal. You therefore get more for your money. Custom-made clothes last longer: partly because the quality of cloth is superior, but also the personal touches - hand finishes, hand pressing and hand stitching  - cannot be simulated on a production line. Even when the garment is worn out, the original pattern will be on hand to make an identical copy. During its lifespan, a coat can be regularly re-lined and repaired. Seams (particularly with traditional bespoke-wear) are generous enough to be easily taken in or out to accommodate fluctuating weight. But most impressive of all, knowing Ms Average does not exist, tailors are trained to take individual posture into consideration. It is best to try a personal recommendation first and, when it comes to traditional tailoring, look for a tailor who is a member of the industry's governing body, the Federation of Merchant Tailors. The procedure is straightforward: at blueprint stage in buying a jacket, for instance, a few questions will be asked: Will you be wearing it in the country? Do you prefer thinner or thicker cloth? Do you intend to wear it with trousers or a skirt? Two prices will probably be quoted - one with, and one without the fabric (in which case the customer provides it). Price decided, you pay approximately one third of the total price, the rest to be paid on completion. One, possibly two fittings follow before the garment is finished. In total, you will have to wait at least three to four weeks for your made-to-measure jacket. If this seems an eternity, you could buy off-the-peg and wait around 10 days for any alterations. Alternatively you could spend the next five years looking for perfection. No contest: I am off to the tailor's tomorrow.</p>

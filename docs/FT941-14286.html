			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Reformer quits rather than cry surrender Apres moi le deluge was the message from Mr Boris Fyodorov, Russia's 35-year-old finance minister, whose resignation last night leaves a gaping hole in the country's economic reform programme. A pugnacious champion of market reform, he said he was quitting not just because his conditions for staying had been rejected, but because the government was planning to abandon his tough financial policy. 'There is a fine line between a moderate policy and an inflationary policy,' he said, expressing hopes that 'the few remaining professionals in the government' would try to prevent the 'catastrophe' of hyperinflation. Announcing his resignation, Mr Fyodorov predicted that attempts to fight inflation by means other than tough monetary and fiscal policies would lead to a surge in inflation in the second quarter, from its present level of around 20 per cent a month. 'Nothing' would stop the fall in the rouble, which has lost a third of its value against the dollar in the past three weeks, unless, he added sarcastically, Mr Victor Gerashchenko, the central bank chairman whose removal he had demanded, kept 'his promise of a return to a fixed exchange rate'. Moves towards a domestically convertible currency have been one of the main components of reform in the past two years. Mr Fyodorov doubted Russia could count on significant help from international organisations such as the International Monetary Fund to support a changed course. Hours earlier, Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, who angrily rejected Mr Fyodorov's attempts to dictate conditions for staying in his government, sought to pre-empt such remarks by vowing he was not retreating from market reforms but correcting them. 'The age of market romanticism is over,' Mr Chernomyrdin declared. He denied he was planning to spend his way out of crisis, saying it is 'not true that Chernomyrdin will give money here and there'. The government had to embrace other tried and tested methods for fighting inflation, including promoting competition, pursuing an industrial policy and, he hinted, wage limits to be agreed between government, unions and workers. 'Fyodorov's departure shows the government is determined to change tack and see if there are other ways to control inflation,' said one western economist. 'I would expect what they are saying: more support for industry and agriculture, and less reliance on markets to determine economic restructuring. It is a change of direction rather than going from one extreme to another.' The problem is that many of these policies, including an anti-monopoly policy and an industrial policy of selective support for industry, have been proclaimed by the government for a year or more. Nor are they inconsistent with what Mr Fyodorov was trying to achieve in his role as finance minister. They have not worked because they have been badly handled, insufficiently developed or too awkward politically. Russia's economic reform has never been comprehensive or synchronised. It has suffered from frequent personnel changes and a dearth of talented people, in an area where pushing through consistent policies places heavy demands on individual politicians and economists. Over the past year, Mr Fyodorov has struggled to curb Russia's high inflation, and has, at the least, fended off a real threat of hyperinflation. In the process, he was accused of starving various ministries of funds to spend on industry, defence, and other state sectors. But he had little choice in a government accustomed to taking spending decisions it could not afford. Mr Fyodorov's departure does not mean the death of economic reform; that is a process difficult to stop. But it heralds a slowing of pace, and the loss of a highly effective professional to a government where no ministers, except Mr Anatoly Chubais, the deputy prime minister responsible for privatisation, can point to concrete achievements. 'One wonders whether they'll be any more successful in picking industrial winners than losers, especially given a populist parliament,' one economist said. Mr Fyodorov's departure will be a blow to the confidence of western financial institutions, creditor banks, and large sections of Russia's business community. He was the man people loved to hate, but many of his supposed enemies will be sorry to see him go, for, at the least, he pursued a clear policy rather than no policy at all. 'He was right not to give money to everybody who wanted it,' said one executive at Avtovaz, Russia's biggest car producer. 'Why should he give more money to agriculture when we cannot even reap what we sow?'</p>

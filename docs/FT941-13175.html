			<p>940127 FT  27 JAN 94 / Ahern delivers on tax promise Mr Bertie Ahern, the Irish finance minister, has delivered on his promise to accelerate tax reform and give a boost to domestic demand in his 1994 budget unveiled yesterday. Hailed in advance as a 'budget for jobs', Mr Ahern has focused his new measures on easing the tax burden for the lower paid, by a substantial widening of the standard rate tax band, eliminating a 1 per cent income levy, reducing employers' and employees' national insurance contributions and increasing personal income tax allowances. The effect of these reliefs will be to increase disposable income at the lower end of the income scale by IPounds 333m (Dollars 478m) in a full tax year, equivalent to 1.1 per cent of GNP. Overall private sector consumption is estimated to grow by 4 per cent in 1994. This should boost consumer and business confidence, especially in those industries manufacturing mainly for the domestic market and which have experienced the heaviest job losses over the past three years. Although the Irish economy has one of the best performing economies in the EU, exhibiting growth averaging 5 per cent since 1987, a low fiscal deficit and low inflation, these successes have not stemmed the rising tide of unemployment, which now stands at 18.4 per cent of the workforce - almost twice the EC average. This budget, although unlikely to make a dramatic impact on the jobless figure, should nonetheless help to reverse the trend without fuelling inflationary fears. Mr Ahern said the budget is aimed at creating 'faster sustainable economic and employment growth' which would keep government borrowing 'comfortably below 3 per cent of GNP'. Inflation is 'unlikely to exceed 2.5 per cent' in 1994, compared to 1.5 per cent in 1993, he said. GNP growth in 1994 is projected at 3.75 per cent. He said capital spending is set to grow by 7.3 per cent, while construction-related spending is budgeted to grow by 9 per cent. Mr Ahern has partially offset the expansionary effects of the budget, by increasing excise duties on beer, tobacco and spirits, and shifting some of the tax burden to middle and higher income groups, and reducing a range of discretionary tax reliefs. Property taxes are also to increase. The net effect of the measures will result in a cost to the exchequer of IPounds 162m. Government borrowing is targeted at IPounds 798m in 1994, or 2.7 per cent of GNP, only 0.2 percentage points higher than in 1993. Any public-sector pay increases for 1994, which have still to be finalised, have already been built into that figure. This will be reassuring news for the financial markets looking out for signs of any slackening of fiscal discipline. Opposition leaders, however, were critical of Mr Ahern for not going further with tax reforms. Mr Ivan Yates, the spokesman for the Fine Gael party, described the budget as 'modest, conservative and unimaginative'. The government's own projections are for unemployment to fall only 5,000 to 289,000.</p>

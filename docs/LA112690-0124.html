			<p><P> November 26, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> END OF COFFEE CARTEL HURTS AFRICA  </P> <P> African coffee-producing countries have lost more than $1.6 billion since the  collapse 15 months ago of the International Coffee Agreement -- the industry's  price cartel, a top Kenyan official said today.  </P> <P> Opening a five-day meeting of the Inter-African Coffee Organization in Nairobi,  Kenyan Vice President George Saitoti said African economies had been affected  greatly by the losses because of their heavy reliance on agriculture as a  source of foreign exchange.  </P> <P> Africa was worst hit, he said, but no coffee-producing country in the world  benefited from the onset of a free market.  </P> <P> "The lifting of quotas has led to increased export volumes which has caused  considerable buildup of stocks in consumer countries, leading to the 40% drop  in coffee prices," Saitoti told the meeting.  </P> <P> He called on African producers to address themselves collectively to their  joint problem.  </P></p>

			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / People: Barings' global shuffle Barings is beefing up its emerging markets coverage by sending two senior directors, to New York and to Hong Kong, to be closer to the clients in Latin America and Asia respectively. Andrew Norris, 41, goes to New York as joint head of equity capital markets, while Jeremy Palmer, 37, whom Barings is hiring from JP Morgan in London this month, moves out to Hong Kong, as the other equity capital markets boss. 'Latin American business naturally looks to the financial community in New York, not London,' Norris explains. In terms of placement power, proximity to the North American investor base for say, an Asian deal, is important, too. He adds that 'the competition' - largely American investment banks - had been observed last year moving more staff out to Hong Kong for similar reasons. 'The trouble is, issuers tend to look on the Americans as being more globally capable. Actually, it is a complete fallacy - the majority of our staff live outside Europe. Do the majority of the staff of an American investment bank live outside America?' Norris's equity capital markets operation in London had recently become, for administrative purposes, part of Baring Securities, rather than Baring Brothers. Following the departure of Christopher Heath, Baring Securities is now headed by Peter Norris, Andrew's brother who is two-and-a-half years his junior. So is he pleased not to be reporting directly to him any more? 'I rather miss him actually,' is the reply. David Watkins, 49, a Goldman Sachs veteran between 1972-1991, joined in January and becomes the director with responsibility for equity capital markets not covered from New York or Hong Kong - again principally emerging markets - as well as for London syndication of Asian, Latin American and other issues.</p>

			<p><P> August 30, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> UCI IS SUPPORTED FOR REJECTING BID THAT WAS 1 SECOND LATE  </P> <P> A UC hearing officer has upheld a controversial decision in which UC Irvine  administrators rejected the lowest bid for construction of a  multimillion-dollar cancer building because it was one second late.  </P> <P> Don McIntyre, attorney for Taylor Woodrow Construction in Irvine, said the  decision will cost California taxpayers $149,000 per second -- the amount they  would have saved had the Taylor Woodrow bid been accepted.  </P> <P> "It's kind of ironic," he said. UCI Medical Center, McIntyre said, is faced  with millions of dollars in deficits each year, "and on the other hand we get a  result like this."  </P> <P> After a daylong hearing on the contract process earlier this month, UC hearing  officer James J. Putkey concluded Monday that Taylor Woodrow was responsible  for meeting UCI's bidding deadline June 8 at precisely 2 p.m.  </P> <P> "Taylor Woodrow's bid was irregular because it was late," he wrote.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Victor Is Pleased  </P> <P> Putkey also said the Taylor Woodrow bid did not comply with UCI bidding  requirements because, although its representative may have entered the room  where UCI officials were accepting bids by 2 p.m., "the bid was not deposited  at the front desk" in that room on time, as bidding documents specified.  </P> <P> Further, had the late bid been accepted, Taylor Woodrow would have had an  unfair advantage over other bidders because the firm "had more time to receive  lower subcontractor bids and thus present a lower bid to the university,"  Putkey wrote.  </P> <P> Bernards Brothers Inc., a San Fernando construction firm, won the contract over  three others with a bid of $8.65 million. Taylor Woodrow and Moran Construction  of Alhambra submitted lower bids, but those firms bids were not even opened  because UCI officials said both were one second late.  </P> <P> Taylor Woodrow bid $8.5 million on the project, and Moran Construction bid  $8.53 million.  </P> <P> Officials from Bernards' applauded Putkey's decision Tuesday. "It's customary  for bids to be rejected if they're late, whether it's one second, one minute or  one hour," said Ted Gropman, a construction law attorney representing Bernards.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'A Long Story'  </P> <P> Meredith Cefali, the UCI contract administrator who handled the bidding,  declined to comment on Putkey's decision and on whether any UCI bidding  procedures have changed because of the dispute. "It's a long story," she said.  "I'm not going to go into it."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Charles Glidden, vice president of Moran, which had protested UCI's  bid process but did not appeal, conceded: "Our representative was wrong. He  should have had the bid in" at precisely 2 p.m. Still, Glidden said: "One  second -- that's pretty picky. And it's going to cost the state or the taxpayer  a considerable amount of money."  </P> <P> Taylor Woodrow officials said Tuesday that they will probably appeal the  hearing officer's decision in court. Still, project executive Chris G. Elliott  called the situation an unusual example of "bureaucratic stubbornness."  </P> <P> According to some of the bidders and their attorneys, UCI administrator Cefali  had on June 8 assembled a half-dozen bidders for the cancer building contract  in a row of offices along a hall on the Irvine campus. Each contractor's  representative had a telephone so that he could talk to officials in his  company's office.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Arcane Process  </P> <P> According to those familiar with the process, the public contract bidding  process is an arcane and frenetic one. In the space of a few hours, officials  in a construction company's headquarters get quotes from subcontractors, figure  out their costs and profit margins, then telephone the total to a "bid runner,"  who races with the formal bid to the office where it is to be submitted.  </P> <P> The pace is frantic because "bids are compiled at the last possible moment" so  that competing contractors will have less opportunity to "shop" subcontractor's  bids -- that is, ask one subcontractor to beat another's price, said Taylor  Woodrow attorney McIntrye.  </P> <P> This was the process used by the prospective contractors for UCI on June 8. But  according to hearing officer Putkey, shortly before the 2 p.m. deadline, Cefali  had received no bids and had asked another UCI official to go down the hall and  give bidders a one-minute warning. According to Putkey's report, the Taylor  Woodrow bid runner heard the warning, immediately sealed his bid and delivered  it to the bid room.  </P> <P> At this point, the Taylor Woodrow officials contend, the procedure became  unfair. They contend their office was farthest down the hall from where the  bids were to be submitted, so that when a UCI official told them they had one  minute left, they were "misled" and that they actually had less time remaining.  </P> <P> Cefali was using as an official clock a telephone recording of the time that  was broadcast to bidders on a speaker phone. After sounding the 2 p.m.  recording of the time, Cefali hung up the telephone receiver. And, according to  Putkey, "immediately after the receiver was hung up, Taylor Woodrow's runner  deposited the bid in the bid deposit box on the front desk" and Cefali rejected  it.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'In the Room'  </P> <P> McIntyre contends that the bid should have been accepted because "physically  our people were there in the room. There was a sweep-hand clock on the wall.  And they went to hand the bid to Ms. Cefali, and she said, 'What's this?' They  said, 'This is our bid.' And she said, 'Well, you're late. Well, you're one  second late.' "  </P> <P> McIntrye said he thinks UCI officials could easily end the dispute by  admitting, " 'Let's say this is a mistake; let's get on with business rather  than spend $149,000 that need not be spent.' "  </P> <P> Bernards officials say the contract was properly awarded, and Putkey agreed.  </P></p>

			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / People: New sales force head at National Westminster David Poulton, 48, has been appointed head of regulated sales for National Westminster Bank's UK branch business, with responsibility for directing the bank's 2,700 strong sales force, engaged in selling life insurance, mortgages, pensions and other investments. Poulton started his working life at British European Airways in 1963, staying with the airline five years before joining Rothmans UK, where he was initially a salesman, rising to become director of the company's sales force. All told he spent 20 years at Rothmans. Then in 1988 he joined Lloyds Abbey Life Assurance, moving in 1989 to join Black Horse Financial Services as sales director. The business of selling financial services has come under close scrutiny in the UK recently. NatWest says it has decided to restructure its sales operations in the light of regulatory and competitive changes, in order to ensure proper emphasis on compliance and training is carried out. Poulton will have the task of monitoring those sensitive changes.</p>

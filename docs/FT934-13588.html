			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Smith accuses Clarke of delaying rate cut MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour leader, yesterday demanded an immediate cut in interest rates as he delivered a wide-ranging attack on the government's economic strategy. In a series of speeches, Mr Smith accused Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, of deliberately delaying a reduction in borrowing costs with the intention of 'sweetening' tax increases in next month's Budget. The Labour leader also sought to capitalise on renewed unrest on the Conservative back benches about the imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel. Mr Smith called on Conservative MPs concerned about the tax to join with the Opposition to overturn the measure during the passage of the Finance Bill which will follow the Budget. He said the increase in VAT threatened economic recovery. He added: 'It is imperilling consumer confidence because people are now realising the tax increases which the Conservatives already propose will cost the typical family Pounds 8.50 more a week.' His message was echoed by Liberal Democrats, who said that the proposed Pounds 1 per week on the state pension next April would be more than offset by a Pounds 1.60 per week rise in heating bills for elderly people. Later, Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, said Mr Smith ought to admit that, if Labour had won last year's general election, 'they too would have put VAT on heating'. Speaking at a Manufacturing Matters conference in London, Mr Smith broadened his attack on the government's economic policies by accusing it of ignoring the need for an industrial strategy. He told the conference that Britain had a Pounds 7bn trade deficit in manufactured goods last year, the 11th consecutive year in which manufactured imports had exceeded manufactured exports. The deficit had weakened the economy, added to inflationary pressures and forced unemployment up even higher, he said. Mr Smith added: 'This deficit cannot be ignored. It is eating away at British prosperity and the living standards of ordinary working people throughout the country.' Calling for an immediate reduction in interest rates, he said: 'The cut should not be delayed until it is convenient for the govern-ment's news management, but intro-duced now when industry and the wider economy so clearly require.' Lower borrowing costs should be accompanied by a phased release by local authorities of the Pounds 5bn they had accumulated in capital receipts, he said. The money should be used largely to finance new housing programmes. Mr Smith said that a future Labour government would set up a defence diversification agency to help defence companies move from production for the battlefield to production for the high street. It would also encourage the European Community to set up a 'recovery' fund for infrastructure, training and environmental projects.</p>

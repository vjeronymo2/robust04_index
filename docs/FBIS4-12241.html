			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 6 Apr (MENA)--Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political  adviser to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and head of the  Palestinian delegation to the negotiations with the Israelis on  the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement, has said that  President 'Arafat reviewed the negotiations during his meeting  with President Husni Mubarak this afternoon.    He said the Palestinians welcome any help to resolve the  pending issues so that the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of  Principles can be implemented on schedule on 12 April.    Sha'th told journalists following the latest round of  Palestinian-Israeli negotiations that President 'Arafat also  discussed the results of the negotiations during his meeting  with Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana. Egyptian Foreign  Minister 'Amr Musa was also briefed on the results, he added.    Sha'th said: We did not achieve the progress we expected to  achieve to sign the final agreement on schedule on 12 April.    He accused the Israeli delegation of obstructing the  negotiations. Noting that the Israeli delegation left the  negotiations at this time for a long recess (three and a half  days) without finalizing the issues under discussion, Sha'th  said: It is difficult to blame us for this; the Israelis are  entirely to blame.    Sha'th said the Israeli delegation promised to continue the  negotiations by fax and telephone. We are waiting to see if  this will solve the remaining problems, he said.    He stressed that this depends largely on the intentions of  the Israelis and their readiness to end the negotiations on  time. If this is the case, he said, a practical result can be  reached on Sunday or Monday.    Sha'th went on to say: We are working and are ready to work  every minute of the remaining five and a half days before  Tuesday 12 April. I firmly believe that if the Israelis have  good intentions there is enough time to reaching an agreement.    The Palestinian official explained that the economic talks  in  Paris will continue tomorrow and the day after. Had these  negotiations [in Cairo] been given a similar chance, he said,  they would have been completed on time.    Sha'th said the Israeli delegation's ending the negotiations  ahead of schedule on the pretext of marking the holocaust (the  burning of Jews by the Nazis during World War II) means the  Israelis have obstructed the negotiations in some way.    We could celebrate the intifadah or any other dear national  Palestinian occasion by observing a silence or by breaking up  the negotiations for an hour, he said. Ending the negotiations  before their time in this way, he added, is an obstruction.    Sha'th stressed that the Palestinians still insist on the  specified date for the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho  agreement, that is, 13 April. He said this date is extremely  important and must not be overlooked. There is enough time to  achieve this, he said.    Sha'th added: The Israelis know full well what we want and  what is required. I do not believe it is impossible to achieve  what is required.    He said he tried to persuade the Israeli delegation to stay  to complete the negotiations but the delegation insisted on  leaving.</p>

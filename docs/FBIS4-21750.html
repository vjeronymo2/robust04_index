			<p>BFN     [Text] Algiers, March 28 (AFP) -- A Russian embassy  employee was murdered Monday at Saoula, south of the capital,  the fourth Russian slain in the North African country in six  months, security officials said.    Two Frenchmen were slain last week, victims of the war being  waged by Islamic fundamentalists against the military-led  government. More than 30 foreigners have been killed in the  country in the past six months.</p>

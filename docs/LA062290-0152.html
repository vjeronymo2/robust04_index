			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> BARNETT SAYS SHE'LL SEEK COUNCIL SEAT  </P> <P> Jo Ann Barnett, a longtime board member of the Anaheim Union High School  District, has announced that she will seek a City Council seat in the November  election.  </P> <P> Barnett, 58, has served for 19 years on both the city elementary and high  school boards and believes that the city should be paying more attention to the  problems of gangs and drugs.  </P> <P> "I think it's about time the city recognizes that there are some gang problems  here," Barnett said. "I think we need to put more money into the  gang-suppression efforts."  </P> <P> She would also like to bring more cohesion to the often-antagonistic council, a  role she said she has had much experience playing in her many years as a school  board member.  </P> <P> "I can work with other people -- that's my strong point," she said.  </P> <P> Though she ran for the council unsuccessfully in 1982, she said she learned  that funding is an essential part of a winning campaign. "A lot of people told  me that if you had waged a campaign, you would have won it. So this time, I'm  going to do it," she said.  </P> <P> Barnett raised about $5,000 at a recent back-yard barbecue, her first campaign  function. She expects to raise about $80,000 to $100,000 in her bid for the  seat. LISA MASCARO  </P></p>

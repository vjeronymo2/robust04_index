Lu Yucheng, vice mayor of the municipality, made a report at  the conference. Under the guidance of the guidelines of the  14th party congress, according to the requirements of the  seventh party congress, under the leadership of the municipal  party committee, the municipal government, and the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs, and with the great support of relevant  departments, in 1993, the municipal foreign affairs front  accurately implemented the central authorities' foreign  principles and policies, emancipated the mind, renewed their  ideas, and made new progress in expanding the contacts with  foreign countries, serving the economic construction, and  managing foreign affairs. All this forcefully promoted the  further development of the opening to the outside world. The  contacts with the capitals of foreign countries and foreign  cities are unprecedentedly vigorous. As of now, the  municipality has established friendly ties with 18 foreign  cities and government- level contacts with 96 capitals cities of  72 foreign countries. The number of persons entering and  leaving the border increased rapidly. The foreign economic and  trade volume increased by a big margin. The import and export  volume reached $3.04 billion. A total of 3,752 foreign-funded  enterprises of three types were newly approved. The daily  approvals numbered 10. Some $6.28 billion foreign capital were  introduced according to agreements. The municipality made  progress in developing foreign cooperation in the scientific and  technological aspects. A total of 1,054 scientific and  technological groups were dispatched and 622 foreign specialists  were invited. The number of foreign cultural contacts increased  with each passing day. Sixty-nine cultural troupes were sent  out and 104 groups were invited from other places. The external  contacts in the educational, public health, and sports spheres  were ceaselessly expanded. Districts and counties made great  headway in developing foreign affairs. The mass organizations  established closer contacts with the outside world. The  management of foreign affairs was further strengthened. New  achievements were made in conducting external propaganda.  Simultaneously, we must notice that we still lag behind in  emancipating the mind and suiting the demands of reform, opening  up, and modernization.    Lu Yucheng said: The basic ideas guiding the 1994 foreign  affairs work are: Take Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on  building a socialism with Chinese characteristics as a guidance;  comprehensively implement the guidelines of the third plenary  session of the 14th party Central Committee and the 1994 work  principles as defined by the municipal party committee and the  municipal government; make new breakthroughs in expanding  foreign contacts, serving economic construction, and  intensifying the management of foreign affairs; safeguard the  stability of the capital; create a good environment and  condition for opening to the outside world; form, step by step,  a pattern of foreign contacts suitable to internationally large  modernized cities; and make contributions to becoming fairly  well-off three years ahead of schedule. We should achieve the  work in the following five aspects: Further expand the contacts  with foreign countries, further serve reform, opening up, and  economic construction, further intensify the management of  foreign affairs, further strengthen foreign propaganda, and  further strengthen the setup of foreign affairs worker  contingents.    In his speech, Li Qiyan expressed thanks to the foreign  affairs office of the State Council, the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs, and the central departments concerned for their support  to the work of Beijing Municipality. He stressed: Beijing's  foreign affairs work is related to the implementation of the  central foreign policies and the image of the state. So, we  must conscientiously and comprehensively implement to the letter  the basic line of the party and define the line of foreign  affairs according to the basic line of the party. The primary  task is to serve the foreign affairs of the central authorities  and to positively work in cooperation with the central  authorities to fulfill various specific tasks. We should make  the foreign affairs work serve the economic construction,  further emancipate the mind, pioneer channels for attracting  foreign affairs, promote the cooperation in the economic and  trade and scientific and technological spheres, and promote the  economic development of the municipality. The foreign affairs  work should serve the capital's political and social stability.  This is the primary task of the municipality. The foreign  affairs work should serve this overall situation. Li Qiyan also  urged the necessity to stress the unified and centralized  leadership over the foreign affairs work and to guard against  the practice of each acting according to its own way. The party  committees and governments at various levels should pay  attention to foreign affairs work. The party and government top  leaders should personally engage themselves in the foreign  affairs work. The newly elected district and county leaders  should pay attention to studying the party's foreign policies,  the knowledge of foreign affairs, and foreign etiquette. We  should intensify the construction of the foreign affairs worker  contingents, strengthen the improvement of administrative  honesty and diligence, set strict demands, and grasp the study  of politics, policies, professional knowledge, and foreign  languages.    Li Yongan, secretary of the municipal discipline inspection  commission, made a speech on strengthening foreign affairs  discipline and correcting the unhealthy trends of using public  funds to go out of the country (border) for trips.    Municipal leaders Qiang Wei, Meng Zhiyuan, Hu Zhaoguang, and  Shen Rendao attended the conference.</p>

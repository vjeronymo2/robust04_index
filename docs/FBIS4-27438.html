			<p>CSO     [Text] Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) subsidiary NTT  International [Minato ward, Tokyo; Hideaki Kamitsuma,  president], which engages in the design and sales of electrical  communication systems from overseas sources, on 1 June will  begin domestic sales of U.S.-made software used in developing  systems for processing facsimile transmissions. The software  enables the building of a system to integrate processing of  voice and facsimile on a personal computer with only a  voice-processing board and without installation of a  facsimile-processing board, enabling addition of the function at  about one-half of prior costs.    The subsidiary plans to capitalize on the introduction of  the  new software by expanding product offerings in the  facsimile-processing equipment group.    The product that the subsidiary will sell on an exclusive  basis is "Multifax" made by communications and data-processing  equipment maker Commetrex (Atlanta, Georgia; Michael Coffey,  president). The software enables installation of a system with  as many as 2,148 circuits. Processing speeds are set at 9,600  bits per second for transmissions and 4,800 per second for  receipts.    The software is used in conjunction with a voice branch  exchange (VBX) voice-processing board made by U.S. Natural  Micro-System (NMS) Company. The system functions on top of a  digital signal processor mounted with a voice-processing board  and does not affect the performance of personal computers.    The subsidiary envisions development of software that will  boost transmission and receiving speeds to 9,600 bits per second  by this summer and is considering sales of communications modems  in the future.    The price is set at 400,000 yen for the installation kit and  7,500 yen for licensing of each circuit. Each additional  personal computer connection will require a 12,000 yen fee for  an unauthorized-software-copy prevention connector. The  subsidiary has a goal for the first fiscal year of selling  enough systems integrators developed through the use of NMS  voice-processing boards to cover 300 circuits.</p>

			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Hashimoto under fire for war remarks Japan's government was yesterday plunged into a dilemma over whether to sack one of its most valuable cabinet ministers or risk a serious row with China. Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, international trade and industry minister, yesterday came under pressure from China to resign over recent remarks about the second world war. Mr Hashimoto had told parliament, in response to an opposition party question, it was a matter of delicate definition whether Japan committed aggression against its Asian neighbours during the war. 'Hashimoto's remarks thrust him into the centre of controversy over Japan's continued reluctance to accept responsibility for the war, an issue that has ended the careers of two ministers this year,' the official Xinhua news agency said. South Korea said Mr Hashimoto's remark was regret-table. If he is obliged to step down, the government will lose a senior figure in holding together the three-party coalition of the conservative Liberal Democratic party, left-wing Social Democratic party and the small centre-left New Harbinger party. Mr Hashimoto, a senior member of one of the LDP's main factions, is the government's toughest trade negotiator and an important influence in economic policy. If he stays, the risks of a row with China are intensified when relations between the two are already difficult. China's relations with Japan became suddenly precarious several months ago, when they were drawn into a protracted wrangle over the presence of senior Taiwanese officials at the recent Asian Games in Hiroshima. Mr Hashimoto irritated China again only last week by meeting his Taiwanese counterpart, Japan's first formal ministerial meeting with Taiwan in 22 years. The ill-health of Mr Deng Xiaoping, the Chinese leader, contributes to inflexibility among Beijing's leaders, unwilling to step out of the official line when a power struggle may be imminent. Mr Tomiichi Murayama, Japan's socialist prime minister, has sought to defend Mr Hashimoto's war remark, while the chief government spokesman, Mr Kozo Igarashi, maintained yesterday that the comment was misreported. The growing queue of Japanese ministers to lose their jobs for their views on wartime history (four in the past eight years) is a testament to Japan's continuing internal divisions over whether it was aggressor or victim. Mr Hashimoto, 57, on the right wing of the LDP, represents an important minority which feels that Japan's recent wartime apologies should not diminish the honour of its war dead. He heads an association of bereaved war families and leads a controversial annual visit of LDP colleagues to the Yasukuni Shrine, where war heroes, including some convicted war criminals, are remembered.</p>

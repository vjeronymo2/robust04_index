Prosecutor's Office investigator Mikhail Slinko said the  investigation work done by the ICCCC last year lay outside the  commission's authority.    The prosecution started on September 3, 1993, against  officials from the Agrokhim Association (today called the  Russian Agrochemical Company) suspected of unauthorized transfer  of funds abroad, was quashed on February 22. But eight of the  19 volumes of Agrokhim case documents which concern the  operations of the Vozrozhdeniye financial and trading company  distributing baby food bought in Israel have been sent over to  the Prosecutor General's Office, the Moscow Prosecutor's Office  being unable to trace the whereabouts of a shipment of baby food  worth $1.5 Mn.    On January 17, the Moscow Prosecutor's office terminated the  prosecution against former vice president Aleksandr Rutskoy,  whom the ICCCC suspected of illegal dealings with the Trade  Links Ltd. company. In this connection, the office the same day  started a libel case against "an unidentified person," in which  Acting Prosecutor General Aleksey Ilyushenko is a witness.</p>

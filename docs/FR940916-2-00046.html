Since application of the updated determinants and the removal of certain stranded costs associated with Account No. 165 and the unrecovered balance of a take-or-pay settlement agreement with a former affiliate, as described in the August 19, 1994, Order, does not serve to decrease the surcharges applicable to Rate Schedules FT, EFT, SCT, IT and EIT, no change to these rates is required by the Commission's order. Accordingly, Panhandle does not propose to put the recalculated surcharges in effect at this time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Panhandle states that copies of its filing have been served on all affected customers, all parties to this proceeding and applicable state regulatory commissions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any person desiring to be heard or to protest the said filing should file a motion to intervene or a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426, in accordance with &sect;&sect;385.214 and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before September 19, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the Public Reference Room. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Lois D.

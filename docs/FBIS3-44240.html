			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] There is open conflict between businessmen and the  Customs and Excise Office [FIDA] over the unilateral fixing of  the exchange rate by FIDA management at 90 new zaires to the  dollar, while the Bank of Zaire's official rate is 35 new zaires  to the dollar. This state of affairs has given rise to protests  these days by members of the National Association of Zaire  Enterprises [ANEZA). Over to you, Kalinda Molonu:    [Molonu] For businessmen, FIDA's measure is causing sheer  anarchy because the fixing of the official exchange rate, they  argue, is only within the competence of the Central Bank. It is  illegal for any public service to fix the foreign exchange rate  for its charges outside the official rate fixed by the Central  Bank and the commercial banks. In a note to FIDA regional  directors, the headquarters of this state public company  explained that its decision was made in view of the very big  loss incurred by the public treasury in implementing the Bank of  Zaire's official exchange rate.    ANEZA feels that the more than 150 percent increase in the  exchange rate decided by FIDA will cause a more than 150 percent  increase in the prices of basic commodities, as well as total  confusion in the exchange market because businessmen will no  longer know which rate to refer to in their export transactions.</p>

Asked by TANJUG what the EU, which is currently chaired by  Greece, planned to do following the U.S. initiative for a  Moslem-Croat federation in Bosnia, Papoulias said Europe would  come out with its own ideas on how to resolve the crisis.    Acting under strong pressure from Washington, Bosnian Moslem  and Croat officials met in Washington on Tuesday to sign a  preliminary deal on forming a binational federation, which would  subsequently form confederate ties with neighbouring Croatia.    Washington's idea is to use the binational federation  manoeuvre to enable the Moslems to preserve the integrity of  Bosnia, expand the territory under their control, give them  access to the sea and, finally, create a strong negotiating (and  possibly military) bloc against the Serbs.    In Cairo, Papoulias met Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak for  talks on various issues, including Bosnia-Herzegovina, but he  did not elaborate on that point.    Egypt has cautiously welcomed the Moslem-Croat rapprochement  under Washington's auspices, but the government-controlled press  has been writing over the past few days the latest developments  clearly indicate that Bosnia will be divided and that its days  in the present shape are numbered.    Bosnian Serbs, who were not invited to the talks in  Washington, formed their own republic in 1992 in their ethnic  and historical territories.</p>

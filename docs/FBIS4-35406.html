			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] At the Foreign Ministry's meetings hall today,  brother Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, minister of planning and  development, met with the heads of the diplomatic missions in  Sanaa. [passage omitted]    Dr. al-Iryani added: Yemen's position on this issue is that  it regards what is taking place in Yemen as an internal affair  and that the Security Council is not entitled [to discuss this].  At the same time, since the move began at the Security Council,  we have not said that we categorically reject any resolution  issued. We cannot say in advance that we will accept any  resolution issued. We adhere to this opinion, and we do not  want to have differences with this international institution.  However, it is our right to [word indistinct] and to have  doubts about the reasons behind raising this issue. We have the  right to say that this is the beginning. No one, however, knows  what is the end of this new discussion of an internal Yemeni  problem.    Al-Iryani continued: Thus, the Yemeni leadership decided to  send a Presidential Council member and the justice minister to  the United Nations to explain Yemen's viewpoint on this internal  affair and to stress that the Republic was established on  genuine bases according to the international law, that both the  declaration of the Republic and even its timing were made in  consultation with the United Nations, and that the foreign  ministers of the two formerly independent states which merged  into one state, the Republic of Yemen, signed all [word  indistinct] statements at the United Nations and for the members  of the diplomatic corps. [words indistinct] we signed all  statements and decisions and [words indistinct] unity on the  ground, so he later said: [passage indistinct] once again  asserts its [word indistinct] and commitment to the  international charters and the UN Charter by legitimate  decisions. We cannot at all have difference with the Security  Council. However, we have the right to express our viewpoint  and not to accept interference in our internal affairs. I  reiterate this [words indistinct] and that we have the right to  say that interference in our internal affairs is not permitted  according to the UN Charter.    Brother al-Iryani added: As for the principle of a  cease-fire, I assert that we appreciate and respect everyone who  demands stopping any war anywhere in the world. However, [word  indistinct] any war has conditions and [word indistinct]. The  reasons for this war and the intentions of the rebellious side  should be known. It is clear that the intention of the rebels  was secession. Did [words indistinct] the secessionists to  cease fire know in advance that [word indistinct] want secession  and at the same time they demanded a halt to fighting? We leave  this question for the (?future).</p>

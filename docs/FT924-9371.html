			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Harmony rebels hit out at board THE INCREASINGLY hostile battle for control of Harmony Leisure, the loss-making pubs and restaurants group, reached a a new pitch yesterday when rebel shareholders accused the board of financial incompetence and defamatory tactics. Launching their strategy to revive the company, the dissidents said they would reverse the slide in Harmony's performance marked by accumulated losses of Pounds 6.9m over the past three years. Mr Andrew Martyr, leader of the rebel group, dismissed management allegations that the dissidents had misled shareholders about their former directorships and lack of experience. Harmony was behaving like President Bush's failed campaign team and 'the board has resorted to personal attacks and innuendo to stave off defeat,' he said. The rebel leaders, who hope to oust the board at an extraordinary meeting later this month, claim 36 per cent support for their restructuring plans. The board has rejected the rebel plans as 'opportunistic' and urged shareholders to back the current management team. Mr Martyr, however, warned that failure to unseat the board could result in Harmony being absorbed by a larger group, leaving shareholders facing considerable losses. 'The board has proved itself incapable of taking the action necessary to rescue Harmony,' he said.</p>

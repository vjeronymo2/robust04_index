			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ISSUES OBSCURED IN HOTEL COVERAGE  </P> <P> In its coverage of the proposed luxury hotel on the Santa Monica beach  (Westside, July 15), The Times has placed too much emphasis on personalities  and not enough on the public policy dispute.  </P> <P> The first issue is the impact of private development on the public environment.  Building a $300-a-night hotel on public parkland is a bad idea. Nearly 50% of  California's beaches are in private hands already.  </P> <P> This non-essential project will generate 3,000 more vehicle trips per day on  the already-choked Pacific Coast Highway. It will pollute the air with  construction dust in excess of allowable levels for two years. It will increase  the sewage flow from 11,000 to 25,000 gallons per day on a sewage system  already past its limit. Water usage will increase from 24,000 to 45,000 gallons  per day while the rest of us are trying to conserve.  </P> <P> The second issue is whether we should exploit a finite environmental resource  to generate revenue for social programs. The hotel purports to provide "public  access," mainly through a community center, showers, a restaurant and a  sculpture garden -- token gestures to buy support for the luxury purposes.  </P> <P> The hotel is defended as a cornucopia of revenue for beach cleanup, local  schools, parks and other social programs. The Times repeats the developer's  false claim that these benefits will total $3 million per year. In fact, the  owners are relieved of providing full guarantees after the first year, and the  rest of the benefits depend on a booming 80% occupying rate and a  three-year-old economic analysis that was prepared when hotels were more  profitable than they are now. If the hotel goes bust, the mortgage holder is  not required to provide the key public access promises.  </P> <P> Why not turn to general revenue or fees to clean up the beach? Why pay for  schools and homeless programs by exploiting public parklands? The "logic" is  folly when you consider that environmental resources are limited and the cost  of social programs is unending. Why not sell off the rest of the environment to  pay for the city's social agenda?  </P> <P> There is no need for what the developer himself calls a "Bel-Air Hotel on the  beach." We have a duty to preserve our threatened environment and pay for  programs through the open budget process.  </P> <P> TOM HAYDEN  </P> <P> California Assembly  </P></p>

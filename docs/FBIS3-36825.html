			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Asia" program] </F>   [Text] International sanctions can be taken against the  DPRK. If Pyongyang does not accept the international inspection  of its nuclear cites before 21 February, sanctions can follow,  said ROK Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu. A Board of Governors  meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] will be  held on 21 February in Vienna. The meeting is expected to adopt  a resolution on sanctions to be referred to the UN Security  Council for deliberation. In this connection, station  commentator Valeriy Surikov writes:    The situation on the Korean peninsula is deteriorating these  days. The three parties, namely, Washington, Seoul, and  Pyongyang, are responsible for it. For instance, the United  States and the ROK are planning to resume the Team Spirit--the  large-scale annual joint military exercise--this year.  Pyongyang regards the Team Spirit ROK-U.S. joint military  exercise as an exercise aimed at northward invasion.  Furthermore, the Pentagon is attempting to deploy Patriot  anti-missile missiles in the ROK and even to bring back tactical  nuclear weapons there. This attempt will only adversely affect  the situation on the Korean peninsula, giving rise to a very  negative reaction from the Pyongyang side.    In the meantime, the measures taken by Pyongyang these days  are not contributing to the alleviation of tension either.  Pyongyang made a principled promise last December that it would  permit international inspection of its nuclear sites.  Nevertheless, the IAEA has not received a reply on  materializing the nuclear inspection. Moreover, the DPRK stated  that it could withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty  and give up negotiations with the IAEA by reason of the Team  Spirit military exercise.    A spokesman for the Russian Foreign Ministry has recently  issued a statement clarifying the Russian position. Moscow  claims that since there is still an opportunity to resolve the  nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula by diplomatic means, the  problem should be solved through talks.    Not many days are left before 21 February. However, all the  parties concerned have enough time to ponder about the right and  wrong of the problem. There is still time and opportunity to  find a reasonable solution. It is time they fully operated the  institution of talks, rather than of pressure.</p>

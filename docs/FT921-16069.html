			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Westinghouse calls on US federal court to drop bribery charges: Philippines Nuclear Power Allegations WESTINGHOUSE Electric of the US has called on a US federal court to drop bribery and corruption charges against it in connection with a nuclear power project in the Philippines. The Dollars 1.1bn (Pounds 596m) civil action was brought against Westinghouse and consultants Burns &amp; Roe, also of the US, by the Philippines government and the National Power Corporation of the Philippines. Last autumn, the companies were committed to face trial by jury, which is scheduled to begin on February 3. The appeal follows an unexpected judgment by the International Chamber of Commerce in Geneva, which is hearing aspects of the case. The ICC, shortly before Christmas, found that the case against Westinghouse was circumstantial and without merit. The allegations stem from a contract awarded to Westinghouse in 1976 to supply the Philippines with a 620 MW nuclear power station. The allegations claimed that Dollars 17m in consultancy fees paid to Mr Herminio Disini, a Manila businessman, were passed on to then-president Ferdinand Marcos to secure the deal. The nuclear station was completed, after several delays, in 1986, shortly before the fall of the Marcos government. It was mothballed before being put into service by the government of Mrs Corazon Aquino. A number of issues relating to the performance of the contract were turned over to the ICC arbitration tribunal in Geneva, but part of the ICC's brief was to consider the bribery and corruption allegations. To the surprise of both the defendants and the plaintiffs, the ICC judgment came down strongly in favour of the US companies. The judgment said: ' ..There is no direct evidence that Marcos supported Westinghouse because he expected to benefit (from commission payments to an intermediary). The circumstantial evidence also fails to prove that Marcos promoted Westinghouse because he expected to receive (commission payments from an intermediary). There is no evidence either of any agreement between Marcos and Westinghouse or (that the intermediary) acted as agent for Marcos. 'Although (the Philippine) parties argue that the circumstantial evidence establishes that Marcos must have received a share of the commissions (from the intermediary), the tribunal is not persuaded.' A Westinghouse official said that the company was delighted with the news as it 'vindicates the position which Westinghouse has taken for over 14 years, that is, that not one dime was ever paid by Westinghouse to President Marcos.' The company now hopes Judge Dickinson Debevoise, the New Jersey federal court judge, will drop charges. In his decision to order the jury trial, he said he found 'ample evidence to permit a reasonable jury to find that the Disini commissions were intended to be paid in whole or in part to President Marcos.' According to US legal officials, he now will have to weigh his findings against those of the ICC. He is expected to rule on the Westinghouse appeal following oral hearings on January 24. Judge Debevoise will be the presiding magistrate at the jury trial should it still go ahead. A spokesman for the plaintiffs said the Philippines government was considering an appeal to the Swiss Supreme Court.</p>

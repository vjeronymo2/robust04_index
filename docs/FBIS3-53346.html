			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Egypt has sent a protest note to the Sudanese  Government over its plans to build a dam on the Nile north of  Khartoum. In the note, which was delivered by Egyptian  Ambassador in Khartoum Hasan Jad-al-Haq last week, Egypt  rejected the construction of any project on the Nile that could  affect its share of water in accordance with the 1959  water-sharing agreement signed by the Nile basin countries.    Meanwhile, the Irrigation and Foreign Ministries are  preparing scientific and political studies to confront any such  project in the future.    This topic is expected to be placed on the agenda of the  upcoming meeting of the Egyptian and Sudanese foreign ministers.</p>

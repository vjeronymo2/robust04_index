			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tax rises 'may not clear deficit' THE TREASURY acknowl-edged yesterday that the tax rises announced in the Budget might not be enough to wipe out the structural parts of Britain's fiscal deficit. Mr Chris Riley, a senior Treasury official in charge of medium-term economic analysis, told the Commons Treasury and Civil Service committee it was reasonable to assume that roughly two thirds of the deficit was cyclical or related to the recession, with the rest being structural. Questioned by Ms Diane Abbott, Labour MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington, Mr Riley told the committee it was impossible to say whether the Pounds 16bn of tax rises promised over the next three financial years would clear the parts of the deficit deemed to be structural. Mr Riley said there was a danger that over a period of several years some of the cyclical parts of the deficit became structural because of the need for the government to make large interest payments which eventually became part of the deficit. The Treasury expects a gap between spending and borrowing in 1993-94 of Pounds 50bn, moving to Pounds 44bn in 1994-95 and Pounds 35bn in 1996-97. It has not given details on how much of the deficit is cyclical rather than structural. Mr Riley told MPs that the Treasury had revised down its assumptions about the UK's growth path over the next four years because of the longer-than-expected recession, the degree of spare capacity in industry and the sluggish state of consumer spending. In this month's Budget, the Treasury assumed average growth of about 2.5 per cent per year in the four financial years from 1993-94, compared with corresponding projections of about 3.5 per cent in last year's Budget.</p>

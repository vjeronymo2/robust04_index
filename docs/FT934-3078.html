			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Management: Square pegs in round holes - Re-engineering does not always fit Contrary to all the hype surrounding the subject, most 're-engineering' projects fail to create much improvement in the financial performance of the organisations which introduce them - sometimes it even gets worse. This is in spite of the considerable impact which re-engineering often has on individual 'business processes', in terms of both cost reduction and productivity improvement. The reason for this apparent paradox is that most re-engineering projects lack breadth, depth, or committed leadership by senior executives - even all three. These are the main conclusions of a study of re-engineering projects in 100 companies around the world carried out by three consultants from the New York office of McKinsey &amp; Co, Gene Hall, Jim Rosenthal and Judy Wade. Of 20 companies which the consultants studied in depth, many cut the cost of their redesigned processes by between 15 and 50 per cent. But only six achieved total cost reductions of above 13 per cent in the business unit concerned; the highest was 22 per cent. Even these better efforts created, at most, a marginal rise in pre-tax earnings. As one of their 'five keys to a successful redesign', the consultants say that chief executives of organisations with re-engineering projects need to commit between 20 and 50 per cent of their time to them. In its indictment of narrowness, shallowness, and lack of leadership, the study reinforces existing evidence that, because of all the hype, the term 're-engineering' is being mis-applied by many companies. First, it is being attached to the design of narrow activities within individual departments or 'functions'. One example given by the consultants is accounts payable. By contrast, the originators of the term intended it to be applied only to broader processes which span several departments, such as order generation and fulfilment, in which billing and payment are only small components. Second, the study underlines the danger of seeing re-engineering as a shallow, isolated exercise, rather than combining it with other elements of 'change management'. The consultants itemise - albeit in rather an odd order  -six so-called 'depth levers' which must also be changed: people's roles and responsibilities; measures and incentives; organisation structure; information technology; shared values; and skills. Reporting on their study in the latest issue of the Harvard Business Review*, the consultants single out three companies as model re-engineers: AT&amp;T, Banca di America e di Italia, and Siemens Nixdorf Service. In all three cases, senior executives not only set ambitious goals, but restructured every element of the organisation. By contrast, the McKinsey team cites a European commercial bank which expected that a redesign of some of its back-office activities would cut its process costs by almost a quarter. The actual reduction was only 5 per cent, and pre-tax earnings rose by a scant 3 per cent. The reason was not only that the bank had overlooked many back-office processes, but also that back-office costs represented only 40 per cent of its total costs. 'The process had been too narrowly defined,' the consultants comment. Apart from committing large amounts of the chief executive's time, the consultants' other 'key steps' to successful re-engineering include the setting of aggressive performance improvement targets for the entire business unit concerned, not just for one or two individual processes within it. They conclude that the problem is that most executives think they can accomplish everything 'with a memo and a slick video of the CEO talking about the need for change'. *How to make re-engineering really work.

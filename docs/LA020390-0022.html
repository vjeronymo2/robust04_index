Dr. Veronica Prego claims that she contracted the disease  from a needle left carelessly at Kings County Hospital. A professor at the  Columbia University Graduate School of Business testified that Prego could have  made up to $30 million in her normal estimated working lifetime of 32.8 years  had she not become infected.  </P></p>

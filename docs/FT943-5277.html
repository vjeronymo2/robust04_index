			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: UK car market After all the hype, the August car sales figures have been disappointing, and puzzling. Thanks to massaging by the trade the full month's numbers due out tomorrow may well be better than the flat out-turn earlier figures suggested. Even so, underlying sales appear to have gone off the boil. They could hardly have continued for ever at the pace set in the first half. But given the encouraging signs elsewhere in the economy, including a pick-up in new house sales in August, a sharp slowdown is hard to explain. One possibility is that the problem lies not with demand but supply. Anecdotal evidence suggests supply shortages of certain models, in some cases caused by a lack of key components. There are long waiting lists for some German cars due to the unexpectedly strong recovery in the domestic market earlier in the year. But supply shortages do not explain why dealers are complaining about the disappearance of the private buyer. This is especially odd since private new car buyers tend to sell-on after five years and 1989 was the peak of the last cycle. Perhaps car buyers are showing the same bargain-hunting mentality evident in other consumer markets and holding out for better deals at the end of the month. Or maybe they have finally tired of the August registration scramble. Whatever the explanation, the odds must favour poor August figures being a temporary blip rather than a change in the trend, in which case the sharp fall in car dealer share prices over the last few weeks could soon be reversed.</p>

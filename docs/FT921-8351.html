			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Survey of Tyne and Wear (9): Sunny side up, please - Social difficulties THE local authority economic development officer explains his stance on Tyneside's social problems. 'When you go to see companies in the South you give them a pretty positive picture of the area,' he says. 'But here, I would be foolish to pretend there weren't problems.' This approach to Tyne and Wear's deprived areas has been common among those who anxiously seek to attract inward investment, in a bid to ameliorate the very problems they find it delicate to discuss. At the best of times, the area's economic regeneration bodies have been touchy about its image, thinking it too grim; too negative. September's riots in the West End of Newcastle and the Meadow Well estate in North Shields were seen when they happened as a marketing calamity, a washing of dirty linen in public. In a sense, the riots happened at the least-worst time; the recession meant there was little inward investment to be frightened off. The view has since been promulgated locally that the 'events' had no impact, that similar criminally-inspired incidents of little real significance were happening in the south but were, most unfairly, less reported than Tyneside's. Even so, any national mention of the riots still provokes unease. The desire to present everything sunny side up is a mirror image of the tendency, in some media quarters, to treat Tyneside's deprived areas as a fascinating wen of squalor and hopelessness. 'They didn't want to hear the positive side of what we're doing,' complains one woman campaigning for improvements in her area despite threats from the local criminal network which resents any challenge to its power. She remains bitter that a threat during the riots to petrol bomb her house was, briefly, a 'good story' for a reporter phoning from a safe distance. She and her friends are bitter too that the rising tide of crime, harassment and quiet misery in their vandalised estate had gone largely unreported for years before. What the riots did highlight was the extent to which some areas have become virtual ghettoes where people inhabit a different world from the far more pleasant localities where other Tyne and Wear residents live. Many of the latter have no direct contact with these grim estates, except through car crime. Newcastle's City Challenge submission for the West End, an area of 35,200 people, says that more than 50 per cent of its 16- to 24-year-olds are jobless. The overall 23 per cent unemployment rate masks pockets of well over 50 per cent. Only 2.1 per cent of pupils at the local comprehensive obtain five or more GSCEs. Just 14.4 per cent of households are owner-occupied; only 15 per cent have a car. In Scotswood, within the Challenge area, a tenant-led survey revealed that only 20 per cent of residents are in full-time work, and that one in four homes reported a break-in in 1991. At the Meadow Well's primary school, at the time of the riots, every pupil qualified for clothing grants. 'We took the kids to MetroLand once,' says a mother of five children at Scotswood, where the streets look over the Tyne to the MetroCentre and its funfair. 'We couldn't afford for them to go on any of the rides; it was so disappointing.' Her 17-year-old son has become involved in car crime. 'I lost him to the street culture,' she says. She told the police of his activities and suffered severe harassment from local youths for 'grassing'. Although still nervous of going out even by day she is actively involved in the Scotswood strategy steering group, working with the local authority to improve the area. 'The reason we're fighting is for our kids,' she says. 'With the three younger ones I tell them the world out there is a bad world.' In the 1980s, Tyneside was dealt the full pack of government urban initiatives, most designed to stimulate the economy by investment in bricks and mortar. But long before the 1991 riots, recognition was growing that the trickle-down effect was insufficient to tackle the scale of problems in deprived areas. It had also become apparent that spending money on the physical fabric was not on its own a solution. A consensus has emerged, among bodies ranging from the TWDC and Labour party-controlled local authorities to the groups of tenants - mostly women - who are fighting for a better future, that progress can be made only if local people have an active, leading role in improving their areas. 'It's less top down and more bottom up,' says regional DTI director Pamela Denham. 'Empowering people is the word.' Among the places where this theory is being tested is the Meadow Well, now focus of a multi-agency initiative. A group of committed residents is developing a community village concept, running in tandem with other projects. There is also the start of a return to policing on foot and Mr John Stevens, Northumbria's new Chief Constable, is bringing a fresh mind to tackling crime. One of the most influential experiments, begun in the late 80s, is the Cruddas Park Initiative. Led by the private-sector Newcastle Initiative it has focused the efforts of government departments, private companies, the city council and residents on a small deprived area. It has transformed some local people's lives by giving them a sense of achievement, a job and an income. This partnership concept is the nub of City Challenge, the new scheme of Mr Michael Heseltine, Environment Secretary. 'The great advantage we have in Newcastle is that the learning curve is already in place; a lot of people have been working at this for a number of years,' says Mr Jonathan Blackie, its City Challenge director. All five Tyne and Wear councils are eligible to apply for the next round of Challenge funding; all will. They hope to apply the lessons of Cruddas Park and many other initiatives focused, in some cases for a decade, on problem estates dotted throughout Tyne and Wear. But is the private sector sufficiently big, and willing, to get deeply enough involved in so many places? And will City Challenge be swimming against the tide as local authority cuts mean pruned budgets for education, probably the most important initiative of all? Considerable efforts are being made to increase the involvement of business with schools; the Tyneside TEC is spending Pounds 4m on business and education partnerships. Training, too, is central to many local initiatives. Among Newcastle City Challenge's top priorities, for example, is the creation of a Pounds 1m multi-agency training centre in the West End. Throughout Tyne and Wear the TECs are involved in efforts to bring residents back into the labour market. Pre-training courses, some linked directly to job opportunities, are springing up to help those long out of the habit of work, or never in it, to reach the stage of competing effectively for employment. 'The important thing is that people are trained for real jobs,' says Pamela Denham. But are there going to be jobs for many of Tyne and Wear's 64,000 unemployed as the demand for unskilled labour dwindles? 'There's no jobs to be had outside self-employment,' says Colin Lamb,33, of Newcastle, jobless seven years. Mr Lamb had a business idea  - a board game he developed on the unemployment theme, called On Your Bike. He presented a copy to Mr Norman Tebbit, there was a flurry of publicity, then the slow discovery he could not break into the games market. Despite his spent savings and a marriage broken by the strain, Mr Lamb, now living on Pounds 39 a week of state benefits, is glad he tried. He firmly believes his game is a winner but he does not think he is. 'It's the educated people who are working,' he says. 'I did Employment Training and it was an utter waste of time.' He was sent on another training course, got to the gate and turned away. 'I just knew it wasn't going to get me anywhere. You lose heart.'</p>

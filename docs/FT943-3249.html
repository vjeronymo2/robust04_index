			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Accords may hurt poorer countries - Uruguay Round The successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round represents a victory for multilateralism and diminishes the threat of mutually antagonistic trading blocs, the latest United Nations Trade and Development Report says. But poorer developing world countries may be disadvantaged by some aspects of the accords which will erode the value of preferential tariffs and could raise the costs of technology and foodstuffs imports. Enabling developing countries to benefit from trade liberalisation is 'a key challenge to the international community'. It suggests that help is needed in areas such as services, infrastructure, improved investment conditions, and access to international financing. It also highlights the need to help developing countries with marketing techniques. Average tariff levels on industrial products in developed nations will be cut by 38 per cent to an average of 3.9 per cent. But high tariffs remain for 'sensitive' items subject to competition from low-cost countries such as leather goods in Japan and textiles and clothing in the US. In agriculture, the industrialised countries have converted import restrictions into equivalent tariffs which will be cut by 36 per cent over six years. According to Unctad's analysis, this has produced duty levels as high as 1,000 per cent for some items. Even at the end of the six-year period both EU and Japan will be have tariffs on non-tropical farm products averaging over 20 per cent.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Pre- and post-Uruguay Round MFN* tariff profiles  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Importing                 Unweighted MFN         Maximum MFN rate market                    tariff average                         Pre-UR     Post-UR      Pre-UR     Post-UR  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Agricultural products (non-tropical) Canada                   13.4%        8.6%       266.6%     170.6% EU                       32.2%       21.4%       438.0%     280.4% Japan                    31.4%       23.1%       650.0%     552.5% US                       10.3%        7.2%       999.8%     449.9%  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Tropical agricultural products Canada                    4.9%        2.5%        30.1%      19.3% EU                       17.3%       11.1%       162.4%     104.0% Japan                    14.2%        9.0%       589.0%     500.7% US                        9.5%        6.5%       536.9%     429.5%  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Textiles and clothing Canada                   19.6%       12.7%        30.0%      18.0% EU                       10.5%        8.2%        17.0%      12.0% Japan                    10.7%        6.9%        22.4%      16.0% US                       12.8%        9.1%        42.4%      32.0%  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Leather and footwear Canada                   13.3%        9.6%        25.0%      20.0% EU                        8.3%        6.9%        20.0%      17.0% Japan                    29.8%       23.4%        84.0%      75.2% US                       14.0%       11.8%        61.8%      61.8%  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- All products** Canada                    9.9%        5.5%       266.6%     170.6% EU                       10.4%        6.6%       438.0%     280.4% Japan                     9.7%        5.9%       650.0%     552.5% US                        7.0%        4.3%       999.8%     449.9%  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Most favoured nation, ie excludes preferential tariffs **Excluding fuels  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Trade and Development Report 1994, Unctad  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

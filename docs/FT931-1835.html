			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Heseltine hints at coal supply deal MR MICHAEL HESELTINE hopes to set out on Thursday his proposals for Britain's coal industry in a white paper that will identify scope for increasing the market for coal without specifying how many pits will be saved. The trade and industry secretary gave a clear hint yesterday that he believed base contracts between British Coal and electricity generators can be agreed before Thursday's cabinet meeting. That would pave the way for Mr Heseltine to set out the broad outline of how some of the 31 coal pits scheduled for closure could be saved - including via a Treasury subsidy - in the hope of heading off a threatened revolt by Tory MPs. If the government does publish its white paper on Thursday it may have to soften demands that the electricity companies and British Coal first sign contracts for coal. In spite of significant progress in talks over the weekend and yesterday, several minor issues remain to be resolved. Some companies do not believe it is possible to sign by Thursday - others remain reluctant until they see the white paper. Mr Heseltine may have to content himself with a statement to the Commons saying the heads of companies will sign shortly. Mr Heseltine's hint came after Mr John Major chaired a meeting of ministers, including the trade and industry secretary and Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, that lasted nearly three hours. A cabinet committee meets again today. However, the white paper will not include any deal on the generators buying more coal over and above the levels agreed when British Coal announced its pit closure programme last October. Averting pit closures will thus still depend on reaching further agreements with generators. Ministers have floated the possibility of up to a dozen pits being saved, possibly only for a couple of years. That would probably satisfy many of the potential rebels on the Conservative benches. The white paper strategy will enable British Coal to close pits over a period of months, a move likely to weaken opposition. Mr Heseltine has taken soundings from across his party and met more Tory MPs last night - as well as a delegation from the Union of Democratic Mineworkers. A Commons vote on the proposals will almost certainly be delayed until after the Easter recess.</p>

			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / International Company News: IBM's recovery will be long haul, says Gerstner Mr Lou Gerstner, chairman and chief executive of International Business Machines, sees no quick fix for the computer company's financial woes. In the annual report to shareholders, published yesterday, Mr Gerstner says that IBM will recover 'over time'. 'It won't all happen overnight, but we are making significant progress,' Mr Gerstner says in a letter addressed to 'Dear Fellow Investor'. He adds, however, that 'you wouldn't know it from looking at the financial results for the year (1993).' IBM earlier reported net losses for 1993 of Dollars 8.1bn on revenues of Dollars 62.7bn. In 1992 the company recorded a Dollars 5bn loss on sales of Dollars 64.5bn. Mr Gerstner charges that the company 'failed to keep pace with significant change in the industry'. The company 'has been too bureaucratic and too preoccupied with our own view of the world. We have been way too slow getting new things to the market,' he states. 'We believe we can fix these problems because they are caused by us and not factors outside our doors,' says Mr Gerstner, directly contradicting past statements by senior IBM managers who blamed IBM's problems on economic pressures and market turmoil. In a remarkable reversal, Mr Gerstner, who last July stated that 'the last thing IBM needs right now is a vision,' now believes that 'strategy is particularly important for IBM'. Mr Gerstner is expected to begin to reveal his strategies at an analysts meeting later this month. IBM's plans, announced last July, to reduce its workforce by 35,000 by the end of 1995, are unchanged. 'Based on current business conditions, we think that's about the right number,' Mr Gerstner says. The annual report points to IBM's mainframe computers as the crux of its problems. Revenue from mainframe computer hardware declined 27.6 per cent last year, to Dollars 10bn, while personal computer sales increased 23.3 per cent to Dollars 9.7bn.</p>

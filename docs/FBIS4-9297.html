			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Seki Radoncic: "Into the Minister's Ear"] </F>   [Text] The fear citizens of Montenegro have of having their  phones tapped is a legacy of the communist times, but also a  consequence of this government's loose use of the word "traitor"  for those who do not share its political opinions. Finally, an  important reason for suspicion arises from the fact that only  the Montenegrin police in all of Europe are not subject to the  oversight of a multiparty parliament.    It is the public's general belief that eavesdropping is done  on a large scale, says Slobodan Franovic, justice secretary of  the executive board of the LSCG [Liberal Alliance of  Montenegro]. "It is not our view that certain agencies that  exist in all states should not take advantage of certain methods  which represent some departure from certain principles of human  rights, such as the principles of secrecy of the mail or  inviolability of other means of communication between  individuals. However, this must conform to the standards that  prevail in the world."    The Liberal Alliance has announced "that it will take the  initiative for evaluation of the constitutionality of the Law on  Internal Affairs, that is, of Article 23, under which the  minister of police can order the SDB [state security service] to  take steps that depart from the inviolability of the mail and  allow eavesdropping."    The Constitution of Montenegro, Franovic says, provides that  this can be done only on the basis of a court order. However,  the present Law on Internal Affairs allows this on the basis of  a decision of the minister of internal affairs. So, we want the  court to evaluate this and issue a decision, that is, to  establish civilian control over the work of the police. We will  soon file a petition with the Constitutional Court as to whether  one provision of the Law on Internal Affairs conforms to the  provision of the constitution. Specifically, concerning the  procedure whereby the constitution allows departure from the  principle of inviolability of the mail and other communications.  "I personally believe," Franovic says, "since this is more than  obvious, that the Constitutional Court will find that this  provision of the Law on Internal Affairs does not conform to the  constitution."  <H5>  Eavesdropping on Telephone Conversations </H5>   The PTT does not resist when the police monitor telephone  conversations. In all the post offices in Montenegro, that is,  there are separate rooms through which subscriber cables pass,  where eavesdropping devices and telephone recording devices have  been installed; post office employees are not allowed to enter  except in special cases.    Aware of this kind of collaboration between the police and  the post office, the former Democratic Party [DS] filed a  criminal charge back in 1990 against several persons because of  warranted suspicion they committed the crime of unauthorized  eavesdropping and recording.    The basic public prosecutor's office responded to the  complaint of the Democratic Party in mid-1991 by confirming that  "in 26 PTT offices in Montenegro there are in fact rooms with  what are called `cable taps' in which is possible to monitor and  record other people's telephone conversations." However, it also  informed the plaintiff that it found no legal basis for  undertaking criminal prosecution of the "suspects."    It is of interest that the basic public prosecutor's office  said at the time "that the powers of the republic secretary (now  minister) of police under Article 24 of the Law on Internal  Affairs are too vague...."    The prosecutor's office also observed the following: The  summary definition of this authority, as represented in the law,  affords an opportunity for arbitrariness and willfulness on the  part of the agency of the state and an erroneous assessment of  the existence of grounds for invoking the authority. In the  judgment of the basic public prosecutor's office, this is  incompatible with basic civil rights....    The basic public prosecutor's office promised at that time  that it would initiate amendment of the legislation in effect in  the Montenegrin Assembly. However, that never went beyond an  empty promise.  <H5>  Bugging Facilities </H5>   In the meantime the police have made technical advances, and  now conversations in Kolasin, Cetinje, and Danilovgrad can be  monitored from Podgorica, conversations in Kotor and Tivat from  Herceg-Novi, and conversations in Zabljak from Pljevlja.    In addition to eavesdropping on telephone conversations, the  police frequently eavesdrop on conversations in facilities they  have bugged. The bugging of facilities (offices, apartments,  houses...) is done by installing highly sensitive microphones in  the walls (especially under wallpaper), light fixtures, pieces  of furniture, or anywhere the police imagination can think of.  The bugging of a facility may be temporary or permanent, again  depending on the police assessment. This method has one  technical deficiency. That is, the place where the conversations  are taped and recorded must not be very far from the place that  is bugged. For example, if a person "subject to operational  scrutiny" goes to a hotel, then through collaboration between  the police and the desk clerk, he is sent to a room that is  permanently bugged. Usually between eight and 10 rooms are  bugged in the larger hotels. One of the hotel rooms is always  "at the service" of the police, and that is the location of the  "operative" who listens in and tapes conversations of the person  or persons in whom the police are interested.    Policemen, depending on the need, also know how to install a  hidden camera. They may use three methods at the same time:  monitoring the telephone conversations, bugging the rooms, and  tailing. The bugging of a room is defeated most easily by  turning on the radio or TV, and turning on a water faucet has  also proved an effective means of defense.    In any case, all the observations of the police, reports,  taped conversations, and so on are coded separately and put in  the same file. The first and last name of the "suspect" are  never used as the code. So, the person, the facility, and the  measure (eavesdropping or tailing), the action, and the file  itself are given separate codes.    The Montenegrin SDB also monitors and records telephone  conversations on behalf of the KOS [counterintelligence  service]. Although by law the KOS, our sources say, is required  to file a request, order and decision of the Montenegrin MUP  [Ministry of Internal Affairs] for such "services,"  eavesdropping is done on no more basis than a verbal agreement  between the heads of these two agencies.    The equipment which the Montenegrin MUP has for monitoring  telephone conversations is nevertheless not quite as good as  what the Serbian MUP has. That is, the Serbian SDB has the  "5001" system, which is the most up-to-date and was purchased  from the French, Germans, and English. This system allows 50  telephones to be monitored from a single point. The system also  allows computer monitoring of a particular subscriber in that it  prints out data on all the numbers called. This system can also  block a large number of telephone lines at the same time,  normally if the "security people" judge that certain people  should be prevented from contacting one another by telephone. A  journalist of POLITIKA has expressed the opinion that "whoever  has this equipment in his hands has control of the country."  <H5>  Who Is Monitored? </H5>   The Montenegrin police regularly follow all the major fairs  of police equipment in the world. MONITOR has learned that Bosko  Bojovic, who heads the Montenegrin SDB, attended the world's  fair of police equipment, technology, and weapons two months ago  in Paris. He was accompanied by a well-known Podgorica  businessman, which could suggest that soon even "our" MUP will  be technically upgraded. As is natural, the price of this police  equipment will be paid for by the citizens of Montenegro, and  many will thus be financing eavesdropping on their own  conversations.    For someone to be monitored, there must be warranted  suspicion of his extremist activity, an activity aimed at  bringing down the order established by the Constitution.  Although they cannot be put in that group, Nikola Samardzic,  former foreign minister, and then Blagoje Lucic, current federal  minister, as well as Branko Abramovic, former agriculture  minister in the Montenegrin Government, have been monitored, our  sources say.    If it is true that current ministers have been unlawfully  monitored, then this greatly strengthens the suspicion that  certain opposition leaders are monitored in Montenegro. For that  matter, it has already been leaked to the public that Slavko  Perovic, leader of the LSCG, has been bugged and that this  operation was allegedly done by the police under the code  "Godfather." It is no secret at all that the eavesdropping on  certain opposition politicians is spoken about openly in the  other opposition parties. But what is the eavesdropping on  opposition leaders compared to the bugging of Dobrica Cosic,  whom the Serbian SDB "bugged," according to the press, while he  was president of the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]?    For the present there is no hard evidence that the police  are  monitoring the telephone conversations of party leaders in  Montenegro. Provided, of course, the arrested leaders of the SDA  [Democratic Action Party] are excluded. However, MUP personnel  who work in the "ear department," we have learned, have their  hands full of work and every morning put envelopes containing  recorded conversations on the desk of Bosko Bojevic. He then  informs Nikola Pejakovic, minister of internal affairs, about  the content of the conversations and other knowledge generated  by the operations.    The minister of police, our sources say, reports all the  more  sensitive and major operations of the MUP (which include the  monitoring of important persons) to Momir Bulatovic, president  of Montenegro, Mile Djukanovic, prime minister, and of course  Zoran Zizic, the inevitable deputy prime minister responsible  for monitoring the operation of the police. Since Montenegro is  the only state in Europe that does not have a parliamentary body  to oversee the work of the police, it is a closed circle.    The police were supposedly depoliticized back in 1989. We  have had a chance to see what this looks like in practice by  watching the TV screen when the camera showed the  "depoliticized" chief of the Montenegrin SDB, Bosko Bojevic,  attending a closed party congress of the incumbent party.  Strange that he should not have attended the open congresses of  the People's Party or the Liberals. Or perhaps he knew in  advance what they would be saying and adopting there, and he did  not want to waste his time?</p>

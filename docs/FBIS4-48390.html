			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report from Lusaka by correspondent Manuel da Conceicao] </F>   [Text] The government and National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola [UNITA] negotiating teams are still  discussing national reconciliation. Today, the government and  UNITA spent the whole day discussing the future of the Voice of  Resistance of the Black Cockerel [Vorgan]. The government wants  Vorgan to operate as a commercial radio station and stop  broadcasting on medium wave because it violates the law. UNITA  accepts this, but says for historic reasons the transformation  of Vorgan into a commercial station must be gradual. The two  delegations will continue discussing the issue tomorrow.    Although the talks have not yet discussed a new mandate for  the UN Angola Verification Mission, the United Nations has  already invited a number of countries to monitor the peace  process once an accord is signed in Lusaka. Jack Mabanga,  Zambia's secretary of state for defense, told today's edition of  the Zambian DAILY MAIL that Zambia is one of these countries.</p>

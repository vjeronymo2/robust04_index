			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, June 15 (XINHUA) -- President Boris Yeltsin  has warned that a system of making inefficient organizations  bankrupt will be introduced in Russia in the near future.    Yeltsin's comments came as he met with entrepreneurs in the  city of Blagoveshchensk in the Far East Amur region of the  country, on the border with China.    "The times when enterprises and whole regions lived at the  expense of the state budget are over," Yeltsin said. "It is  necessary to find one's own resources to survive since living on  subsidies under market conditions is a shame."    He explained that Russia's current task was to transfer the  macro reform to a micro level which is aimed at attracting  investment to boost production and solve social problems.    Earlier today Yeltsin visited the Blagoveshchensk  shipbuilding yard where he talked with the workers and  management. He promised to help seek customers for larger  fishing seiners while suggesting the yard should also make small  boats, which farmers need, on direct, non-state orders.    Yeltsin arrived in Blagoveshchensk on Tuesday [14 June] for  a  four-day working visit. He is also scheduled to visit the local  Republic of Tuva.</p>

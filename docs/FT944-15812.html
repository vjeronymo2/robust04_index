			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Outside directors 'more productive' The productivity of non-executive directors has increased by half in the past three years, according to research by 3i, the investment company. In a study conducted with the Top Pay Research Group, a specialist on executives' earnings, 3i said non-executives were increasingly putting more time into helping companies in a variety of informal ways, while not asking for any more cash. The report says that in 1991 non-executive directors devoted 15 days a year to working on the affairs of each company on whose boards they sat. This figure has risen to 22 days a year, while the average fee per directorship has stayed at about Pounds 15,000 a year. According to 3i this 'spectacular' productivity increase shows that most non-executives are 'less concerned with the size of their fees than with being usefully involved'. The report was based on a survey of 272 non-executives with a total of 767 appointments. Independent Directors Programme, 3i, 91 Waterloo Rd, London SE1 8XP.</p>

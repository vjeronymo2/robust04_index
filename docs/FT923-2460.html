			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Algeria to control imports ALGERIA has set up a government committee to decide on import priorities. This marks a reversal of the policies followed since 1990 of liberalising a strictly centrally-controlled economic system. The government said it was acting 'to contain the risk of economic, social and political collapse', a reference to the resurgence of Islamic fundamentalism since the electoral process was suspended last January and to the unprecedented economic strains from the debt service ratio of the last three years. Priority will be given to imports of foodstuffs, running at about Dollars 1.8bn this year, pharmaceutical products and building materials. The decree urges importers to 'limit their foreign exchange spending to a strict minimum' and to forego ostentatious purchases such as luxury cars. Imports are expected to reach about Dollars 7bn this year while exports, mainly oil and gas, will reach Dollars 11.3bn. However, because of the very heavy cost of servicing foreign debt, the ratio of repayments to foreign income is expected to remain high, at 74 per cent.</p>

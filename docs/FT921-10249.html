			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Letter: Union leader reasserts view of UK traditions Sir, Your report ('Union leaders admit upsetting Japanese', February 3) on the recent visit of a small group of TUC leaders to Japan shows that at least one TUC resolution is helping to influence the world - would that there were more] The fact that Japanese business leaders want to talk more about the British TUC's policy is cheering to those who experience the cold shoulder from their British counterparts. Your report is wrong to indicate that the suggested talks between the Japanese CBI and the British TUC were on the initiative of the TUC. The initiative came from the Japanese who are worried about their international image and concerned to protect their profitable investments in Britain. I hope that something comes out of these discussions to protect the interests of British employees from alien practices such as no-strike deals and employer imposed choice of union. Much has been written about alleged insults during that TUC debate. As the resolution's instigator, my union was anxious to show that the practices described above are contrary to British traditions. They also offend the principles laid down by the International Labour Office for the international community on the rights of association and the right to strike. We have been accused of being racist in the use of the word 'alien'; reference to any decent dictionary will show the word, when used as an adjective, perfectly sums up this complex set of ideas. Only those weaned on comics and 'B'-feature science fiction films make the mistake of accusing us of insulting the Japanese people. Mind you, the statement made by the Japanese prime minister, a man with little experience of manual labour, about the lack of the work ethic in the US makes you wonder. Must we look forward to a working life of long hours, company controlled unions, unquestioning loyalty to the boss, and unrestrained discrimination against women workers? Or is there an alternative based on the dignity of labour, which flows from democratic rights and strong independent trade unions at work? This is what the debate is really about.

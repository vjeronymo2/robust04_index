			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / Business and the Environment: Pollution verdict worries insurers US business has won another round in its long running legal battle with insurers over who should meet the cost of cleaning up pollution. The victory, in an Illinois Supreme Court decision earlier this month, has potentially serious implications for insurers at the Lloyd's market, who are heavily exposed to businesses in the state. The Illinois court decision freed Outboard Marine Corporation, an outboard motor manufacturer, to pursue its insurers for the costs of cleaning up polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) dumped into Lake Michigan between the 1950s and the 1970s. In 1978, Outboard was ordered to clean up the PCBs, which had been present in pydraul, a hydraulic fluid the company had used in die-casting. Insurers  -mainly US companies and none of them London-based - had restricted coverage under liability policies to cases where pollution was 'sudden and accidental' and resisted claims on the grounds that the pollution had occurred over a long period. The Illinois court ruled on December 4, however, that the term 'sudden' was ambiguous and said coverage was available regardless of how rapidly pollution had occurred if it could be shown that pollution had been 'unexpected and unintended'. Nine other US state supreme courts have also ruled on the interpretation of the 'sudden and accidental' clause. Verdicts so far have been mixed, with five courts ruling that there is coverage only where the pollution is 'sudden' in a temporal sense. However, lawyers acting for policyholders claim that the Illinois ruling is a crucially important one and could lead to a huge escalation of pollution losses for the market. Lloyd's underwrites directly in the state (one of two in which it is licensed to do so) and many US companies have their headquarters in the state, which is also one of North America's most polluted, increasing the chances that legal action might take place there. At the very least a series of long-drawn out - and hugely expensive  - legal battles is on the cards.</p>

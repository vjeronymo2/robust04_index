			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Political factors overshadow nervous session - Market report The sharper political focus as voting in both national by-elections and the elections for the European parliament took place in the UK yesterday left share prices to give ground in cautious trading. Falls in government bonds, reflecting market doubts over prospects for Conservative candidates in the UK, also served to unsettle equities. The FT-SE 100 Index ended 9.3 down at 3,028.9, just above the lowest level of an erratic trading session. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index fared a little better, shedding only 1.5 to 3,599.3, largely because second line issues were somewhat neglected. There was some disappointment at the apparent unwillingness of the big institutions to maintain the buying pressure of the previous session. However, Seaq volume was nearly 16 per cent higher. On Wednesday retail value jumped to Pounds 1.26bn, compared with Pounds 936m and Pounds 764m respectively in the two preceding trading sessions, implying a welcome return to more normal trading levels. Turnover was boosted yesterday by a large trading programme at midsession, weighted to the sell side and comprising a wide range of Footsie and Mid 250 stocks. Hanson, Tesco, Glaxo, British Steel, British Gas and BAT Industries were prominent in the programme list. Two more smaller programmes were also identified. Market strategists remained fairly optimistic, pointing to the sharp rise in UK industrial output announced this week. But, with voting in the European elections continuing over the weekend in some Continental countries, the markets expect to remain overshadowed for some days. Investors were also looking ahead to next week when markets face a busier calendar of economic data on both sides of the Atlantic. Equities attempted in early dealings to extend the recovery of the previous day but were checked by a general malaise in bond markets across Europe, although the Bundesbank decision to leave rates unchanged was no surprise. A gain of 6 Footsie points was soon reversed, and at the day's low of 3,025.6 the index was more than 12 points down. London was unsettled at the end of trading by a hesitant start on Wall Street, where the Dow showed a dip of nearly 3 points as the UK markets closed. Some caution was expressed ahead of the announcement, expected today, of the latest producer price index in the US. On the whole, however, markets hope that Federal Reserve credit policy will remain benign, for the time being at least. Trading statements from leading British companies were generally helpful for market sentiment. PowerGen, the electricity generator, pleased the market and the recent buyers of the shares by sharply increasing the dividend payout, thus underlining the yield attractions which have kept the sector in the centre of the stage during the recent market weakness. Also delivering good dividend news was Johnson Matthey, the precious metals group. The market seemed to take an optimistic view of the High Court ruling on Lloyds Bank's bid for Cheltenham and Gloucester Building Society, a move which could have widespread implications for the whole of the UK financial sector. The Lloyds Bank share price reacted only mildly, implying market belief that the Pounds 1.8bn bid will be reshaped so as to secure legal and regulatory acceptance.</p>

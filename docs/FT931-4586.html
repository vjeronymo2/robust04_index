			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / International Company News: Four KIO executives in US to go THE KUWAIT Investment Office, the international investment arm of the gulf state, has made redundant the four executives who have run its Dollars 2bn US property operations for the past decade. Mr Ali-Rashid al-Bader, chairman of one of the world's powerful investors with a portfolio worth around Dollars 20bn, said the four executives, led by Mr Michael Puglisi, had been made redundant in a 'cost-cutting programme'. The four - who include Mr Richard Della Pietra, Mr Richard Battista and Mr Luis Pomponio - were executives of Fosterlane Holdings, a KIO-owned US company. Their departure follows Mr Saleh Al-Zouman's appointment in January as chairman of Fosterlane's management company. Kuwait is one of the 20 biggest investors in US properties. Most of its properties are owned by a network of companies controlled by Fosterlane. It has maintained a veil of secrecy over its US properties. Tenants often have no idea buildings are owned by the KIO. But it has invested around Dollars 2bn in US properties, often in partnership with Mr Gerald Hines, the US property investor. It controls well-known US buildings, including New York's 'Lipstick Building', at the corner of 53rd street and 3rd Avenue, Chase Manhattan's offices at 350 Park Avenue, 101 California in San Francisco, and the Dallas Galleria. It also owns 40 per cent of the General Motors Building in New York. The four departing executives are understood to have three-year contracts and will continue to receive their salaries, estimated at more than Dollars 1m a year in aggregate, for that period. Mr al-Bader said their departure reflected a basic change of approach by the KIO in managing its property portfolio. Rather than expand this portfolio, the KIO would realise investments when it could. He said that this was part of its new worldwide investment strategy, which aims to convert illiquid investments, such as property, into more liquid holdings, because the costs of the 1991 Gulf war depleted the KIO's liquid reserves. An executive with a close knowledge of the KIO said St Martins Property Corporation, the KIO's UK property company, was likely to make substantial property disposals. St Martins owns London Bridge City, one of the biggest Thameside developments in London. Mr al-Bader added there could also be redundancies at the KIO's London headquarters, although no decision had been taken.</p>

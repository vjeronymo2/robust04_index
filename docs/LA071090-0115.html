			<p><P> July 10, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> DISPUTE OVER TREES MAY GO TO COUNCIL  </P> <P> A group of people living along and near historical Broadway, angry that no  decision appears near to save several dozen trees threatened by proposed street  improvements, vowed Monday to appeal to the City Council to resolve the long  dispute.  </P> <P> The group, Broadway and Area Residents, has rejected the city's three options  for the neighborhood and instead offered a fourth proposal.  </P> <P> They suggest saving all trees on the south side of Broadway and replacing trees  lost on either the north or south sides with trees larger than those the city  has offered. Members say they will appeal to the council if no acceptable  agreement is reached this week.  </P> <P> "I'll be really surprised" if the city accepts the new proposal, said Michael  Kowalski, spokesman for the group.  </P> <P> Last month, the city razed trees along several blocks -- some of them more than  50 years old -- to make room for a nearly $1-million street improvement project  that includes adding curbs and replacing sidewalks.  </P> <P> After outraged residents voiced their concern for the remaining trees, the  project was put on hold until a solution could be reached. Despite several  meetings, there still is no agreement in the horizon.  </P> <P> "The three options given to us were not overwhelmingly accepted -- in fact,  none of it was," said Sally White, a longtime Broadway resident and a member of  the group.  </P> <P> Deputy City Manager Arthur Daw, who has been meeting with group members, said  he would listen to their latest offer, but could make no guarantees. "We'll  certainly be open," he said. LISA MASCARO  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SCORCHING WINDS SHOULD EASE AS COOL AIR ARRIVES  </P> <P> The desert-like winds that created a severe fire hazard in the county's  bone-dry hills should ease today with arrival of cooler temperatures,  forecasters said.  </P> <P> Temperatures should dip at least 15 degrees below Tuesday's highs, which  reached up to 95 in parts of the county, they said.  </P> <P> But the second day of scorching heat and blustery Santa Ana winds Tuesday  prompted Orange County fire officials to place firefighters on alert and to  urge residents to take precautions.  </P> <P> In the wake of the two brush fires in Yorba Linda that burned seven acres  Monday, county fire officials put two strike teams on active duty -- one in the  Santiago Canyon area near Villa Park and one in Rancho Santa Margarita, in  South County.  </P> <P> The firefighters "are loaded up, suited and ready to go," said Capt. Dan Young  of the Orange County Fire Department. "They will be on the road within  seconds."  </P> <P> Winds blowing through the Santiago Canyon were clocked at 20 m.p.h., fire  spokeswoman Maria Sabol said Tuesday. With humidity readings at 15% in that  area, the Fire Department was poised to put its stations on red-flag alert, the  highest priority status, had the winds increased by 5 m.p.h., she said. Winds  of 50 m.p.h. were recorded Monday.  </P> <P> Sabol said residents should take extra precautions now, especially because four  years of scant rainfall have left the vegetation in the county's rural  hillsides in a tinder-like condition.  </P> <P> Young said firetrucks are on patrol, not only looking for signs of smoke but  acting as deterrents.  </P> <P> "Our engines are out there in high profile. They're monitoring and looking for  problems. Just looking at a fire engine makes people think about fire  prevention."  </P> <P> Marty McKewon, a meteorologist for WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts  for The Times, said that the Santa Ana condition was expected to subside by  today.  </P> <P> It was created when a high-pressure trough centered in Utah collided with a  low-pressure system over the Gulf of Mexico.  </P> <P> McKewon said that the weather condition is typical for mid-October. "This is  not that unusual," he said. "This always starts happening this time of year."  </P> <P> The winds heat up rapidly as they dive from the mountains into the Los Angeles  Basin, he said. As a result, even the beaches lose the cooling benefit of ocean  breezes, reaching temperatures in the 90s.  </P> <P> The hot spots in Orange County on Tuesday, McKewon said, were El Toro, where  the temperature reached 94, the Santa Ana Civic Center, which recorded 95.  </P> <P> "It's warmer in Santa Ana today than in Palm Springs," where the high was 94.  </P> <P> Ventura FIRES: Three wind-fanned blazes raged near Santa Paula.

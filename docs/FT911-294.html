			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Greek deficit falls by 13.6% Greece's current account deficit fell 13.6 per cent to Dollars 1.69bn (Pounds 1bn) in the first quarter, reflecting a sharp rise in invisible receipts and better export performance, writes Kerin Hope in Athens. But the visible trade gap widened by 14.3 per cent to Dollars 3.45bn, mainly because of higher prices for imported fuel, the Bank of Greece says. It is the first time in over two years that the current-account deficit has shown a quarterly improvement.</p>

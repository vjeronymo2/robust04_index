			<p><P> January 5, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SUPERVISORS OPPOSE PLAN TO BLOCK LANDFILL  </P> <P> The Board of Supervisors has voted to strongly oppose a pending city of Los  Angeles development plan that would block the use of three Westside canyons as  a regional landfill.  </P> <P> The board, on a 3-1 vote, directed its staff to argue at City Council hearings  against a provision in the proposed Mulholland Scenic Parkway Specific Plan  that prohibits development of Mission, Rustic and Sullivan canyons for garbage  disposal.  </P> <P> Last May, three of the five supervisors -- Deane Dana, Mike Antonovich and Ed  Edelman -- said they either opposed a landfill in the canyons or that they  would consider it only as a last resort to solve long-range garbage disposal  problems.  </P> <P> But the supervisors reportedly want to keep the possibility of using the  canyons as a landfill alive as a bargaining chip with the city.  </P> <P> The canyon area is one of six locations that sanitation experts say are  technically best suited to be garbage dumps. Four of the others are on the  northern rim of the San Fernando Valley or near Santa Clarita. The fifth is in  Griffith Park.  </P></p>

			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Poland's former PM heads UN Bosnia probe THE United Nations Human Rights Commission yesterday unanimously approved a resolution appointing a special investigator to compile evidence on human rights abuses in Bosnia-Hercegovina and elsewhere in the former Yugoslavia. The investigator will be Mr Tadeusz Mazowiecki, former prime minister of Poland. The US-drafted resolution calls for the investigator's report to be completed by August 28 and presented, with recommendations, to the Human Rights Commission and the Security Council. US and other western diplomats say they will then consider what further action might be needed to stop the abuses. This might include the stationing of permanent human rights monitors in the region. The resolution condemns 'widespread, massive and grave' human rights violations and the practice of 'ethnic cleansing', demands immediate release of all those arbitrarily detained and access for the International Committee of the Red Cross to all detention camps and prisons. Islamic countries, led by Turkey and Egypt, supported the resolution despite failing to secure changes naming Serbia as the principal perpetrator of human rights violations and Moslems as the main victims. Western diplomats said yesterday that specific condemnation of Serbia should follow rather than precede the special investigator's report, which is intended to be an authoritative and objective assessment of the evidence. They also expressed fears that singling out Serbia and Serb forces at this stage could hamper the investigator's work. Mr Mazowiecki is expected to start work within the next few days, after confirmation of his appointment by the UN's Economic and Social Council on Monday. The self-styled Serb-dominated Federal Republic of Yugoslavia yesterday pledged its full co-operation with Mr Mazowiecki's investigation. The US said it was pleased with the outcome of the exceptional two-day session of the Human Rights Commission, which was convened at Washington's request. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said yesterday it had finally been given access to Omarska, the Serb-run detention camp filmed by British television crews last week, but had found only 200 or so prisoners there. US officials warned earlier this week that prisoners were being moved from Omarska and other Serb-run camps before ICRC visits. Mr Pierre Gauthier of the ICRC said some of the prisoners previously in Omarska may have been moved to camps at Trnopolje and Manjaca. Red Cross officials visited both earlier this week. Mr Gauthier said about 3,500 people were being held in Trnopolje and, at the time of the first visit, some 2,300 in Manjaca. The ICRC has also visited a Croat-run camp at Konjic north of Mostar, bringing to 13 the number of detention centres it has visited in Bosnia.</p>

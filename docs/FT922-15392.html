			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Arts: Holbein for National Gallery The National Gallery has secured its Holbein, one of the paintings on its 'most wanted' list. It was confirmed yesterday that 'Portrait of a lady with a pet squirrel and a starling' will go on show at Trafalgar Square from April 28. Its owner, Lord Cholmondeley, accepted Pounds 10m net under a private treaty sale, which makes the gross valuation of the painting about Pounds 14.5m. This success, after long and tortuous negotiations, is a triumph for three men - Neil MacGregor, director of the National Gallery, who led the campaign to keep the Holbein in the UK; Jack Baer, of dealers Hazlett Gooden &amp; Fox, who undertook the negotiations on the Gallery's behalf; and Lord Charteris, of the National Heritage Fund, who today celebrates his last day as chairman by providing the Pounds 3m which clinched the deal. Originally Lord Cholmondeley, who needs the money to shore up Houghton Hall, his Norfolk seat, was advised to sell the painting at auction, through Christie's on April 15. A price in excess of Pounds 15m was anticipated, but the Marquess would have had to pay tax of around 60 per cent on the hammer price. To avoid this he suggested that the William Kent furnishings at Houghton should be offered to the nation in lieu of tax while remaining at the Hall. This would have made a mockery of the acceptance in lieu provisions. With the National Gallery's annual purchase grant frozen at Pounds 2.75m for the past six years, a package had to be assembled involving the heritage bodies. In the event the National Heritage Fund contributed Pounds 3.5m and there was also a donation from the National Arts Collections Fund. But the bulk of the cash, which the Marquess will receive over three years, comes from the National Gallery committing its future purchase grants. Obviously, after this success it will not be in a position to make any important acquisitions in the foreseeable future, although it does have another purchase fund, financed by J. Paul Getty, that it can use in an emergency. The Getty money helped to purchase the Holbein. Christie's may be relieved at the private treaty sale. It will not gain its 10 per cent buyer's commission on the hammer price, but it will receive a sweetener for its part in the negotiations, and it will not have to risk offering the painting at auction on an uncertain market. To get the same amount of cash for Lord Cholmondeley at auction Christie's would have had to find a buyer willing to pay around Pounds 27m. * The BP Arts Journalism Awards were announced yesterday. Andreas Whittam Smith, editor of The Independent, took the press award for his newspaper's coverage of the Pop Art Show at the Royal Academy. John Higgins, opera critic and obituaries editor of The Times, won a special award for his services to the arts. He started the full-scale FT arts page with Andrew Porter in the early 60s and went on to edit the arts page of The Times for many years.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Marta Salomon and Vanda Celia] </F>   [Text] Brasilia -- According to a restricted access  document that is circulating in Congress, the proposal for the  new Economic Order -- which was drawn up by the rapporteur for  the constitutional revision -- provides for an end to all the  Union's monopolies and an end to the market reserve for  state-run telecommunications and mail companies. The proposal  is being negotiated by rapporteur Nelson Jobim, PMDB [Brazilian  Democratic Movement Party] lawmaker for Rio Grande do Sul, who  opted for a more flexible system, to be adopted by the next  president of the Republic.    The decision to make more flexible the state presence in the  economy is a majority trend within the Constituent Congress,  which will be voting within a couple of weeks on the most  controversial part of the reform. According to the rapporteur's  report, which was released to a limited number of lawmakers, the  concept of national capital enterprise and the restrictions on  foreign capital will both disappear. Most of the activities  that are currently being undertaken by monopolies, or that are  being protected by market restrictions, will be exploited  "directly by the Union, or through concession or authorization."    Jobim believes that his proposal could be good either for a  president with a liberal program of government, or for a  president whose program of government advocates strong  participation by the state. The idea is not to produced a  "fixed" economic model, because after the reform any change will  require the support of three fifths of the congressmen. Despite  the fact that it preserves the Union's power to control  strategic sectors, the proposal does not prevent the  participation of private enterprises in providing telephone and  data-transmission services, for example.    Article 177 of the Constitution, which defines state  monopolies, will undergo a deep change in the rapporteur's  proposal. Not even the prospecting for, production, and  enrichment of nuclear minerals will remain under a monopoly.  Exploitation will be done directly by the Union or by  authorized enterprises.    The Union will also control the prospecting for and  exploitation of petroleum, but will not participate in the  refining, importation, exportation, and maritime transportation  of petroleum, which are considered the most profitable fields.  This is the most controversial point of the proposal:  exploitation of these areas will be free, and the only  constitutional requirement will be to observe technical refining  regulations and customs policies in the case of exportation and  importation of oil and oil byproducts.    The proposal by the rapporteur puts an end to the provision,  included in the 1988 Constitution, which makes a difference  between Brazilian enterprises and national capital enterprises.  Such enterprises will, however, enjoy preferential treatment:  in addition to general benefits in the economy, they will have  exclusive rights to produce minerals, and will enjoy preference  for the purchase of goods and services by the state. Jobim's  proposal ends the privileges and the restrictions affecting  foreign capital in financial and health care institutions. The  proposal maintains a preferential treatment for small-sized  Brazilian enterprises.    In addition to ending the market reserve for enterprises  like  the Postal and Telegraph Company (ECT) for mail services, and  Embratel [Brazilian Telecommunications Company] in the area of  telecommunications, the modifications of the Economic Order will  also affect other sectors. Among these are the exclusive market  for Brazilian ship owners, commanders, and crew members for  long-range navigation, and for navigation along the coast and  along local routes, plus the restrictions on ships built outside  Brazil.  <H5>  The Proposal </H5>   The following are the changes proposed by rapporteur Nelson  Jobim for the Economic Order:    -- The prospecting for and production of petroleum,  natural gas, and other fluid hydrocarbons will no longer be a  monopoly, and will be directly exploited by the Union or by  private enterprises through concessions granted in bidding.    -- The refining of Brazilian or foreign petroleum, the  importation or exportation of byproducts, and the maritime  transportation of petroleum in bulk will be open to exploitation.    -- The transportation of gas or petroleum through pipes  can be directly exploited by the Union or through concession.  The same conditions will apply to the prospecting for,  production of, and enrichment of nuclear minerals.    -- The postal service and public telecommunications  services can be exploited by the private sector with  authorization or concession from the Union, which will lose  control over the National Air Mail Service.    -- The Union will no longer directly exploit the  infrastructure of airports, or the highway, railway, and river  transportation infrastructure for transportation between  national ports and within the national territory. Private  enterprises will need authorization to operate in these fields.    -- The concept of national capital enterprise, and its  benefits, will be terminated. Restrictions on foreign capital  in the financial and health assistance fields will be terminated.</p>

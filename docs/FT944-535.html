			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / Tokyo mandarins feel power of the sword: Japan's bureaucrats are being shaken up in their struggle with politicians The office blocks of Kasumigaseki, Tokyo's civil service district, were shaken yesterday when three of the country's top mandarins, in charge of industrial, international trade and technology policy, lost their jobs. Ministers of the conservative three-party government coalition yesterday approved the resignation of Mr Hideaki Kumano, vice-minister (the top bureaucrat) at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, which took pride in being the architect of Japan's industrial success and is a keen advocate of economic deregulation. His right-hand man, Mr Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice-minister for international affairs - the top trade negotiator - stood down. With them went Mr Kinju Atarashi, chief secretary of the Science and Technology Agency, a Miti fiefdom which runs the country's first home-grown space rocket, successfully launched last summer. They are the senior victims of the ruling Liberal Democratic party's campaign to reassert power over the public administration, which follows the party's return to office six months ago after its first humiliating year in opposition for nearly four decades. The purge further destabilises Miti, already struggling to find a new identity to replace its redundant role of engineering industrial growth. It may take 10 years for morale to recover, mourns a retired official. The Miti mandarins' alleged sin was to get in the way of politicians' attempt to strike a new balance between elected representatives and the holders of bureaucratic power. This is a popular theme on all sides of Japanese politics. Public feeling is shifting away from a public administration perceived as more sensitive to its own interests than to the citizen's. Bureaucrat-bashing excites increasing competition between political parties, in the absence of significant policy differences. Mr Kumano, the Miti boss, was blamed for failing to stop, and by implication for conniving in, the dismissal, by a previous government almost exactly a year ago, of Mr Masahisa Naito, former head of Miti's industrial policy bureau. Mr Naito, until then next in line to succeed Mr Kumano, was ousted for prematurely promoting a young official who was about to stand for the LDP. Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, the Miti minister and a rising star in the LDP, only delayed the sackings because he was waiting for the 1995 budget to be completed, say officials. Meanwhile, Mr Atarashi lost his job because of a row with his political boss, the formidable Ms Makiko Tanaka, the agency's director general. Unwisely, he told Ms Tanaka to restrain a government campaign to trim the number of departments, reportedly warning her that government offices were 'public organs. . . not a minister's personal obsession'. He should have known better. Ms Tanaka, 51, the daughter of former prime minister Mr Kakuei Tanaka, is a popular and much publicised critic of excessive bureaucratic power. She and a generation of younger politicians want to break with the tradition under which ministers were merely ministries' meek figureheads. They would read from scripts prepared by civil servants, leaving policy formation, parliamentary questions, and sometimes international negotiations, to officials. Ministers were kept weak by the former LDP faction system, in which they changed jobs every two years or so to make way for the next faction's candidate. But the LDP factions were finally dissolved a week ago, in connection with the political reforms that took effect on Christmas Day, a deep blow to the old order. Now, 'teamwork between cabinet ministers and the people who shoulder public administration is necessary,' argues Mr Yohei Kono, LDP president. Yesterday's bureaucratic bloodletting is a consequence of a process started in summer 1993 by Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the first non-LDP prime minister for 38 years, when he launched a deregulation drive. Ostensibly, deregulation was supposed to promote consumer demand and open the economy to imports, in which Japan had the support of trade partners sceptical of seeing change to a tightly protected system. But deregulation won political popularity as an attack on the bureaucracy. Mr Naito's resignation, in December last year, brought this into the open. When the LDP returned to office in June, it took up deregulation as an electorally popular policy, despite its own conservative instincts. The government plans to publish the country's first white paper on deregulation early next year and has launched a review of 92 state agencies  -the issue on which the unfortunate Mr Atarashi committed his self-destructive gaffe. There is another dimension to all this. The bureaucracy has also become a battleground between the LDP and the opposition New Frontier party, whose members formed the two previous coalition governments. Many saw the hand of Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the NFP's strategic mastermind, in Mr Naito's dismissal. Equally, the hand of Mr Noboru Takeshita, the LDP's shadow shogun and former prime minister, is thought to be behind yesterday's sackings. Yet the humbling of Miti may not go entirely to the politicians' script. It will, in the short term, further strengthen the Ministry of Finance, untouched by this battle, rather than boost the power of the LDP, warns the retired official. Until this row, Miti was the only ministry strong enough to counterbalance the finance mandarins' fiscal austerity and conservatism, he points out. The Ministry of Finance is increasingly portrayed in the Japanese press as an arrogant defender of the old bureaucratically controlled order. It may therefore become the next target of ambitious politicians, though the men from the MoF will certainly put up more of a fight than did the Miti men across the road in Kasumigaseki.

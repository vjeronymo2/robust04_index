			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / MPs seek bigger coal market to safeguard pits' future THE GOVERNMENT last night faced a delicate political balancing act after a cross-party committee of MPs recommended measures to secure the future of more than half the 31 threatened coal pits. The trade and industry select committee's proposals would increase the annual market for deep-mined British coal by 16m tonnes or more for five years at a cost of about Pounds 500m. This would be achieved mainly by postponing liberalisation of the domestic electricity market until 1998 and subsidising the extra output so that it could be sold at world prices. Barring reform, domestic coal consumption by electricity generators is set to fall to 40m tonnes in 1993-94 and 30m tonnes thereafter. The report is certain to increase pressure on the government as it prepares its own solution to the pit crisis, to be released as a white paper within two weeks. In effect, it leaves cabinet ministers - still smarting from October's retreat - to decide how far below the committee's bottom-line figure the government dare pitch its own proposals, without risking defeat in the Commons. The precariousness of the government's position was underlined last night when Mr Winston Churchill, Conservative MP for Davyhulme, indicated that he and his 30 colleagues on the recently-formed coal group of Tory backbenchers were looking for 'a clear majority' of the threatened pits to be saved. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, would be taking 'a serious personal risk' if he pitched the government's 'bid' significantly lower than the committee's recommendations, Mr Churchill said. As Labour celebrated what it described as his 'humiliation', Mr Heseltine prepared the way for a climbdown by arguing the government would have been 'culpable' if it had not reviewed its original decision in the light of the outcry it generated. The government retained 'an open mind', he said, describing yesterday's report as 'very long, very complicated and very interesting'. A first indication of how the government might respond came in a speech from Lord Wakeham, who chairs the cabinet committee on coal. 'If productivity improvement can be implemented and cost reductions achieved, there is scope for many pits to improve their performance costs significantly within three to five years,' he said. He emphasised that electricity privatisation had been planned on the basis of an eight-year transition to full competition, designed with the interest of the coal industry in mind. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, called for his opposite number's resignation, saying: 'Nobody in business would keep their job after such a monumental mistake and neither should Michael Heseltine.' Mr Neil Clarke, British Coal chairman, said the report supported the company's view that only 'a radical transformation of the market would change the prospect of many of our collieries'.

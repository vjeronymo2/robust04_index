			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Cha Man-sun Reports from Vienna] </F>   [Text] On 3 May, Hans Blix, secretary general of the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], has sent an urgent  telegram to North Korean Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam in an  attempt to make a breakthrough in the issue of witnessing the  changing of fuel rods at North Korea's nuclear reactor in  Yonbyon.    In the telegram, he emphasized that the IAEA would send its  inspectors if North Korea accepts the demands set forth by the  IAEA, and pointed out that the changing of nuclear fuel rods  without witnesses may lead to a serious situation under which  the transparency of North Korea's nuclear development cannot be  guaranteed.    It was reported that Secretary General Hans Blix may have  stressed that the IAEA would be compelled to report to the UN  Security Council of its inability to confirm whether nuclear  materials are being diverted in the event that the nuclear fuel  rods are changed without the presence of inspectors.    Considering that all previous communications have been made  through a working-level channel, the IAEA secretary general's  urgent telegram is taken to be a very unusual step that hints of  an acute situation and that can be interpreted as an ultimatum  regarding the changing of nuclear fuel rods. This step was taken  as the situation turned more serious as North Korea recently  reiterated its position to go ahead with the changing of its  nuclear fuel rods in a statement released by the North Korean  Foreign Ministry.</p>

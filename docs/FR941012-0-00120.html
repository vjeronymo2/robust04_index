			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At paragraph (f)(3)(i) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that the specified logging machines that are placed into initial service after the effective date of the final standard be equipped with falling object protective structures (FOPS) and/or rollover protective structures (ROPS). This provision applies to each tractor, skidder, swing yarder, log stacker, and mechanical felling device, such as a tree shear or feller-buncher. This provision combines the FOPS and ROPS requirements contained in the proposed standard. ROPS requirements are also contained in several State logging standards (Ex. 2&hyph;18, 2&hyph;19, 2&hyph;20, 2&hyph;21, 2&hyph;22, 2&hyph;23, 38J, 38K). In addition, FOPS and ROPS requirements are contained in OSHA Construction Safety Standards, 29 CFR Part 1926, and Agriculture Safety Standards, 29 CFR Part 1928.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA received many comments supporting the FOPS and ROPS requirement (Ex. 5&hyph;6, 5&hyph;7, 5&hyph;10, 5&hyph;19, 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;22, 5&hyph;35, 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;54, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92) and did not receive any comments opposing this provision in general. Many of the commenters addressed the issues of retrofitting machines with ROPS and FOPS and incorporation by reference of SAE standards have been discussed above in the Major Issues section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter said that the ROPS requirement should also apply to loaders on self-loading logging trucks (Ex. 5&hyph;7). However, three other commenters said this machine should be excluded from the requirement because the machine would not meet most state highway height restrictions if FOPS and/or ROPS were added to the operator station (Ex. 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;49). OSHA agrees with these three commenters and has not expanded the FOPS and ROPS requirements to cover loaders on self-loading logging trucks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The necessity of ROPS and FOPS on logging machines is not disputed. Steep terrain, slippery or uneven ground, large loads, top-heavy equipment with loads, and other environmental conditions and unsafe work practices increase the potential for logging machine rollover. ROPS reduce the likelihood that operators will be crushed in the event their machine rolls over. FOPS prevent falling objects such as trees, limbs and winch lines from penetrating the cab and injuring the operator. As OSHA noted in the preamble to the proposed rule, ROPS and FOPS are standard features on all currently manufactured logging machines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on other comments in the record, OSHA has made the following changes to the ROPS and FOPS provision in the final rule:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The ROPS and FOPS requirements have been incorporated in one provision because the SAE FOPS standard (J231, January 1981) specifies that only machines equipped with ROPS can also be equipped with FOPS. The ROPS-FOPS requirement of the SAE standard was pointed out by three commenters (Ex. 5&hyph;16, 5&hyph;22, 5&hyph;57).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Machines only used in construction activities, such as road building, rather than logging operations have been deleted from this provision (e.g., graders, scrapers, bulldozers, front-end loaders). Construction machines and activities continue to be covered under 29 CFR Part 1926.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Forklift trucks have been deleted from this provision and included in a separate provision in the final standard (see paragraph (f)(4)). One commenter pointed out that forklift trucks were manufactured with overhead guards rather than ROPS and FOPS and, therefore, were not included in the SAE standards (Ex. 5&hyph;16, 5&hyph;47; Tr. W1 224)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

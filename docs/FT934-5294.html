			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets: Scandinavia suffers sharp reverses Equity markets were under pressure last week, with Japan, jittery over the corporate outlook, leading much of the pack lower. This was reflected in a 2.26 per cent fall in the FT-Actuaries World index. Most of Europe was on a downward track, with the sharpest falls seen in Scandinavian markets. UBS comments that the steep fall in Ericsson's share price serves as a salutary lesson to all investing in Scandinavia. Foreign holdings have risen sharply in recent months, with foreign investors pumping more than SKr3bn a month into Sweden. 'Domestic funds are not able to replace that sort of cash flow. So when foreign investors turn away from a market, stocks can fall sharply,' says UBS. 'There is, therefore, a real danger to Scandinavian markets if US bond yields rise in the near term, before earnings justify current recovery hopes.' Norway was a casualty of the collapse in oil prices as Opec failed to agree on a reduction in production quotas, although the move is seen as a silver lining for the country's oil shipping sector. Oslo was also dragged lower on Friday by a 7.1 per cent drop in Hafslund-Nycomed 'A' as the pharmaceutical group forecast that current year profits would be held to 1992 levels. Stockholm remained affected by weakness in Ericsson, in continued response to the previous week's third-quarter results, a reaction that Barclays de Zoete Wedd feels was exaggerated. BZW contends that there had been encouraging stability in earnings estimates in recent months, while continued undervaluation of the krona within Europe, as well as further dollar strength in 1994, were a recipe for further positive earnings recovery surprises in 1994-95. Volvo also had a volatile week, with many participants marking the shares lower ahead of a decision on the Renault merger at next Tuesday's egm. But in spite of the reservations of many investors to the link-up, analysts believe the decision of the 4th AP fund, the second largest shareholder, to vote in favour is likely to carry the day. Kleinwort Benson comments that the company presented probably the best set of third-quarter figures in the Swedish market, highlighting the scale of operating earnings recovery. However, it warns that the attraction of the shares as a dollar-exposed turnround story would be minimised if the Renault merger is ratified.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                     % change  % change                   % change in local currency **    sterling **  in US                                                               dollars **             ------------------------------------------------------------              1 Week   4 Weeks   1 Year   Start of   Start of   Start of                                            1993       1993       1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria       -2.34     -3.61   +31.80    +28.87     +24.23     +21.43 Belgium       -0.21     +1.12   +25.00    +25.45     +17.71     +15.06 Denmark       -2.14     -2.61   +35.37    +34.37     +27.18     +24.32 Finland       -3.04     -4.36   +90.89    +90.42     +74.43     +70.52 France        -0.90     -2.18   +25.53    +18.89     +13.65     +11.09 Germany       -1.46     -1.03   +33.88    +32.29     +28.07     +25.19 Ireland       -0.58     -0.65   +50.52    +47.02     +30.34     +27.40 Italy         -0.56     -8.40   +30.90    +27.34     +13.46     +10.90 Netherlands   -0.35     -1.46   +34.60    +31.60     +27.47     +24.61 Norway        -4.92     -7.18   +38.08    +31.56     +25.27     +22.45 Spain         -2.64     -4.35   +37.70    +38.29     +15.92     +13.32 Sweden        -3.70     -8.68   +36.64    +29.33     +11.36      +8.86 Switzerland   +0.14     +1.40   +48.09    +33.51     +33.65     +30.64 UK            +0.11     -1.93   +15.84    +10.81     +10.81      +8.32 EUROPE        -0.63     -2.10   +26.46    +21.47     +17.52     +14.89  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Australia     -2.01     -3.22   +36.77    +27.17     +25.39     +22.58 Hong Kong     +0.52     +1.60   +57.36    +70.70     +74.94     +71.01 Japan         -7.44    -12.25   +10.12     +9.77     +29.04     +26.14 Malaysia      -0.90     -0.88   +73.92    +76.72     +84.95     +80.80 New Zealand   -1.90     -5.66   +39.58    +37.28     +49.93     +46.07 Singapore     -0.54     -3.44   +52.18    +41.48     +48.34     +45.02  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Canada        -0.54     -0.11   +21.54   +19.82      +17.27     +14.63 USA           +0.16     -1.09    +7.48    +5.88       +8.32      +5.88 Mexico        +2.91    +12.54   +30.84   +24.56      +27.68     +24.82  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- South Africa  -1.17     +8.00   +42.59   +35.67      +52.28     +48.85  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD INDEX   -2.26     -4.43   +14.88   +12.84      +18.46     +15.80  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Based on November 26th 1993.

[Jad-al-Haqq 'Ali Jad-al-Haqq] Your question appears to  concern media reports on clashes between some groups and the  police under the name of (terrorism and combating terrorism). I  would like to say first and very clearly: Events in Egypt  cannot be called terrorism. Most of the incidents and attacks  by groups on policemen are reaction. The incidents are either  criminal ones that violate the law or acts of revenge. Revenge  is well known in Upper Egypt. It is wrong to say that these  incidents and their causes are terrorism. "I believe that this  is very clear."    [AL-WAFD] But aren't they attributed to religion?    [Jad-al-Haqq] That is something else. If a thief steals and  says (in the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful), what  do we do with him? There is nothing we can do. But it is wrong  to call this Islam or the Islamic groups and not say what it  really is: This is a thief and this is a killer. Every incident  must be identified for what it really is. Not everything need  be attributed to an Islamic group, because Islam is innocent of  these actions. Islam gives no one the right to exact punishment  himself. It permits no one to steal, kill, or scare people.  How can we affiliate those who do such things with Islam and  say that these are Islamic groups? This is wrong.    [AL-WAFD] But you might agree with me that there are  particular ideas of which some people are convinced. Are their  actions based on these ideas?    [Jad-al-Haqq] This might be the case but the al-Azhar has  called on these people to go to the clerics when they are in  doubt about something. If these people do not go to the clerics  and raise their ideas with them, how can we identify them?    Let them be described by the crimes they have committed when  they are tried. Their ideas will then become known and the  clerics can debate them.    [Al-WAFD] Your Eminence, remember how the military court  that  tried the killers of [former Awqaf minister] Shaykh al-Dhahabi  in 1977 said the al-Azhar and its clerics failed to play their  role and added that their absence from the arena was a reason  for the religious vacuum. It saw the al-Azhar as responsible  for the appearance and spread of terrorism. As in the past, the  same words are reiterated very often these days, are they not?    [Jad-al-Haqq] Without criticizing the ruling to which you  referred, that was a judicial point of view. It wasn't fair in  terms of the reality. Those who take their information from the  media are slack in their duties. The media does not cover the  al-Azhar and does not report the steps taken by it or the things  it is doing. Preachers are all over the country, institutes'  clerics are in all the villages and throughout the whole  country, and everyone is performing his propagation duty. Where  is the slackness?    Al-Azhar's task is to give advice, not to carry weapons or  chase the outlaws. This is the task of other quarters. If the  al-Azhar's effort is not known to those who take their  information from the media, then it is they who have fallen  short in their knowledge. Al-Azhar has never been absent from  the arena and it isn't now.    [AL-WAFD] Does this mean that you don't agree there is a  religious vacuum?    [Jad-al-Haqq] The religious vacuum is in education, not in  life in general. The clerics are doing their job everywhere.  The real vacuum is in education, from the nursery school to the  university.    [AL-WAFD] Criticism addressed to al-Azhar in the past few  years did not come from outside al-Azhar alone, but from its own  scholars as well.    [Jad-al-Haqq] Every man has his own way; not everyone  upholds  the same views. The clerics who accuse al-Azhar of slackness  should ask themselves what they are offering.    [AL-WAFD] We cannot overlook that the major extremist  organization is led by an al-Azhar scholar, Shaykh 'Umar  'Abd-al-Rahman.    [Jad-al-Haqq] God knows that al-Azhar is doing its duty,  from  the oldest shaykhs to the youngest student. But every man has  his own beliefs and his approach to performing his duties. With  all due respect for his person, Shaykh 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman has  his own beliefs and his approach, which is not approved by Islam.    [AL-WAFD] What is your view of that approach?    [Jad-al-Haqq] I have nothing to add to what I have already  said. You said that Shaykh 'Abd-al-Rahman criticizes al-Azhar  although he is an al-Azhar graduate. I said satan disobeyed the  orders of the lord.    [AL-WAFD] In 1977, al-Azhar Grand Imam 'Abd-al-Halim Mahmud  had to issue a statement, which was not published at the time,  defending al-Azhar over accusations leveled by the state and  Islamic groups. Do you think you need such a statement?    [Jad-al-Haqq] No, we do not need it, because we promote the  call and defend nobody. We advise all the people. Al-Azhar  statements were issued at the right time. As I said, everyone  has his way.    [AL-WAFD] But the state and society are demanding that you  play some role in fighting the growing Islamic violence. Do you  think you have a role to play?    [Jad-al-Haqq] The role of al-Azhar or propagation is to give  advice. If the target population fails to respond, al-Azhar  does not have the physical power to impose order. This is the  job of the other apparatuses.    [AL-WAFD] You have not been involved in the mediation  attempts that some people are trying to undertake. Why?    [Jad-al-Haqq] Al-Azhar does not involve itself in everything  that comes to people's minds. It is always useful to give the  opportunity to other institutions that are involved in  propagating Islam, such as the licensed associations. There is  no harm if people intervene in this issue or if they offer to  mediate in it. I have no information on the details. They  offered mediation more than once and I don't know what has been  done about it.    [AL-WAFD] Do you think al-Azhar can play a role in patching  up discord or in curbing the extent of the violence?    [Jad al-Haqq] We can only rectify the discord if we know  about it. Al-Azhar knows only one party to the conflict,  namely, the government. But if the other party becomes known,  then al-Azhar could intercede. We don't know them personally  and we don't know their principles. This is because we read  about them in the press only when events occur.    [AL-WAFD] But haven't you received their writings (books and  leaflets)?    [Jad al-Haqq] Yes. We receive some of their ideas and books.  We study them in a scientific way. But the names of their  authors do not appear in the books. The books have no titles or  addresses. They are merely books seized by the police. Then we  are asked if the books contain sound ideas. We respond  accordingly.    [AL-WAFD] Don't you believe that the discussion of these  ideas in the media would produce good results?    [Jad al-Haqq] It would have been better for the media to  keep  away from the rumors and exaggeration of events. But the media,  be they in Egypt or abroad, have failed to do so. Perhaps the  media in Egypt have, regrettably, been affected by reports  coming from abroad.    [AL-WAFD] In the early eighties, you were one of those who  supervised dialogue with the youths who are described as  extremists. Now, after 10 years, do you believe the dialogue  represents the ideal method?    [Jad al-Haqq] Doubtless, prophets were not sent to the  people  by means of guns, but by the word, which calls for righteousness  and peace, as well as by the call for dialogue. The Koran is  full of dialogue between the prophets and their peoples and  between Prophet Muhammad, God bless him and grant him salvation,  and his people. The dialogue must come first.    [AL-WAFD] Some people blame you, saying that instead of  focusing on confronting the extremists, you are fighting others  by confiscating their books.    [Jad al-Haqq] Al-Azhar does not confiscate books or ideas.  It only prohibits those attacking religion.    [AL-WAFD] Does al-Azhar have its chance to reply in the  various media?    [Jad al-Haqq] No. Al-Azhar has a limited framework that is  not part of censorship. Al-Azhar authorizes the printing of the  Koran and the prophet's sayings only. These can only be printed  with the permission of al-Azhar. Al-Azhar revises the text of  the prophet's sayings and authorizes the printing. Apart from  that, al-Azhar does not interfere. Al-Azhar only examines that  which comes from individuals, groups, or the state. Al-Azhar  gives its opinion as an expert, not as a censor.    [AL-WAFD] Many writings and official opinions in the West,  particularly in the United States, started referring to the  Muslim world as the new enemy and the substitute for Communism.  What is your comment?    [Jad al-Haqq] This is obvious. They mean what they say.  This is evident in the United States and Europe's campaign  against the Muslims and their issues. But particular spots in  the Muslim world have enough problems, which prevent them from  carrying out their humanitarian duties and developing and  promoting their financial and economic resources. Thorns are  being planted in the Muslim world.</p>

			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / ICI unions meet UNIONS representing the UK employees of Imperial Chemical Industries' fibres business met yesterday in London to discuss their growing concern over ICI's policy of divestment. Union concern was heightened by last month's announcement that ICI is to swap its European fibres operations for the acrylics businesses of Du Pont, the US chemicals group. Du Pont, which is to take on ICI fibres employees as part of the deal, is also paying ICI Pounds 250m.</p>

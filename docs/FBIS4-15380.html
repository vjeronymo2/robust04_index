			<p>BFN     [Text] Head of the Yeltsin administration's information  department Petr Filippov believes that the spectrum of political  forces involved in fleshing out a civic peace pact must be  limited. In an interview with Interfax on Thursday, he said it  made no sense to try to involve such hardline opposition members  as those granted amnesty recently in work over the draft.    "If these people say they will agree to sign pact under  their  own terms, there can be no question of consensus with them,"  Filippov said. "I cannot really see how it will be possible to  sign a peace pact with a party like Barkashov's," he added.    The official said that "if there is a certain group of  people  who uphold extremist views, this does not mean that society must  seek a compromise with them." The question is one of opening  dialogue between the government and a civilized opposition,  Filippov believes.</p>

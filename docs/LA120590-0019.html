			<p><P> December 5, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> RED WING STREAK ENDED BY BRUINS  </P> <P> Randy Burridge scored his eighth goal 63 seconds into overtime Tuesday night at  Boston, and the Bruins ended the Detroit Red Wings' six-game unbeaten string,  5-4.  </P> <P> The Wings' leading scorer, Steve Yzerman, scoreless during the streak, sent the  game into overtime when he scored with 62 seconds remaining in regulation.  </P> <P> The Bruins, who blew a 3-1 lead, wasted little time in the extra session.  Goalie Tim Cheveldae of the Wings made a save on Bob Sweeney, but the puck  bounced right to Burridge and he banged it into the net.  </P> <P> The Bruins improved their record to 15-8-4 and stretched their lead in the  Adams Division to five points.  </P> <P> Bruin goalie Andy Moog turned aside 35 shots and ran his lifetime record  against the Red Wings to 11-1.  </P> <P> Vancouver 4, New York Islanders 2 -- Greg Adams scored the tiebreaking goal  with 5:13 left at Uniondale, N.Y. to lead the Canucks to victory.  </P> <P> Steve Bozek intercepted an errant pass and fed the puck to Adams, who skated  across the crease and flipped the puck over goalie Glenn Healy's pads.  </P> <P> The Canucks are unbeaten in five games (3-0-2) and the Islanders are winless in  five games (0-3-2).

			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Premiers urge resumption of Ulster talks THE British and Irish prime ministers sought last night to smooth over any differences between the two governments on the future of Northern Ireland and urged the early resumption of 'round-table' talks in the province. Mr John Major said he hoped talks would start 'as speedily as possible'  - in spite of the proximity of the UK general election. Although Unionist and nationalist leaders are expected to meet today or tomorrow, there has been no sign so far that they are any closer to overcoming the obstacles that have blocked the resumption of talks which collapsed last July. Mr Major's comments came after talks with Mr Albert Reynolds, the new Irish prime minister, in Downing Street. Mr Major promised to use 'every legitimate means' to end the 'carnage' of Northern Ireland. Mr Reynolds suggested that a review of the act which led to the partition of the island should be part of any formal negotiations. That would balance Unionist demands for removal of the republic's constitutional claim on the north, but has already been attacked by the Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist party. Mr Major said the two leaders had 'touched on many sensitive matters like that'. Both leaders reiterated their commitment to the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement, which states that Northern Ireland will remain part of the UK as long as a majority of its population so wishes.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["FM Spokesman on Working Negotiation Between DPRK and </F> IAEA"-- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 28 (KCNA) -- A spokesman of the  Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on  May 28 answered a question put by KCNA on the working  negotiation held recently between the DPRK and the International  Atomic Energy Agency.    He said:    A working negotiation was held in Pyongyang from May 25 to  27  between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on the question of the  replacement of fuel rods at the 5 megawatt experimental atomic  power station.    The main question discussed at the negotiation was the  method  of preserving the technical possibilities of the measurement of  spent fuel rods by the IAEA in case the DPRK undergoes routine  and ad hoc inspections with a package solution of the nuclear  issue between the DPRK and the United States in the future.    As has been reported, we are refueling the reactor in a  unique status following the temporary suspension of the  effectuation of our withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty. Under this condition, we cannot allow routine and ad  hoc inspections by the agency. But we have clarified our stand  of good will for fully ensuring the continuity of safeguards  corresponding to our unique status and for replacing fuel rods  in such a manner as to preserve technical possibilities of  selected measurement of fuel rods in the future.    The United States, the main party concerned with the  solution  of the nuclear issue, also appraised this as encouraging and  expressed to us the hope that we would discuss its method with  the agency.    At the negotiation, the agency, to begin with, raised the  method of selected and separated preservation of fuel rods.  But, an understanding was reached between the sides that it was  not acceptable in principle for it was essentially an inspection  activity falling under the category of ad hoc inspection and  going beyond the unique status of the DPRK.    Hence the discussion was focused on the reasonableness of  the  method now applied by the DPRK to the replacement of fuel rods.    The DPRK side earnestly explained that this is an  appropriate  method of sufficiently ensuring technical possibilities of  freely measuring selected rods as demanded by the agency when  the unique status of the DPRK is dissolved in the future, while  guaranteeing the continuity of safeguards to suit its unique  status at the present stage.    And we ensured all conditions for clearly understanding the  reasonableness of our-style method by allowing the agency  delegation to go down to the spot and confirm the conditions and  work there and have sufficient technical consultation with the  operators of the facilities while the negotiation was on.    The agency side took note of the theoretical feasibility of  this method of ours and its experimental confirmation and  requested us to arrange its content in writing, promising us to  profoundly study the efficiency and practical safeguards of this  method of DPRK style with good will.    We stressed that though this method will enlarge a little  the  amount of measurement, it is the only way for us to adopt in  view of the present conditions of political restrictions. We  promised that we would continue the refueling of the reactor in  such a manner as to accept a series of opinions of the IAEA side  concerning this method and would respond any time to negotiation  that might be proposed by the IAEA side in future.    At the negotiation, a final agreement was not reached on the  DPRK-proposed method, but this method was supplemented and  perfected through the negotiation. We immediately applied this  method to the refuelling of the reactor so that the possibility  of selected measurement of fuel rods could be increased, and we  are placing the process of all work under a strict supervision  of the IAEA inspectors and monitoring cameras.    We consider that through the negotiation with the IAEA side  and the monitoring activities of the IAEA inspectors concerning  the refueling of the reactor, our good will to place our  peaceful nuclear activities strictly under the control of the  IAEA was fully manifested.    We will actively strive to ensure the transparency of our  nuclear activities and do the utmost as ever to find a final  solution to the nuclear issue through the DPRK-USA talks.</p>

			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / International Company News: Ford Canada in Argentina deal FORD'S Canadian subsidiary is reportedly close to a deal to export as many as 125,000 cars to Argentina over the next two years from a plant in Ontario. The Canadian media reported yesterday that financing is still required for the sale, which would be worth more than USDollars 1bn. A Ford spokesman said that 'it's not quite a done deal from our end, but we are extremely hopeful that the financing will soon be in place'. The mid-sized Ford Tempos would be used as taxis in Argentina. Phoenix Plus, a Toronto company which is brokering the sale, would buy the cars from Ford and sell them through an association of Argentine taxi owners to individual operators. Mr Howard Wolle, president of Phoenix Plus, said the company is close to securing loan guarantees from the national bank of Argentina. If the deal goes through, 65,000 cars would be shipped this year, with the possibility of another 60,000 in 1993. The order represents about 25 per cent of the capacity of the Ford plant in Oakville, Toronto.</p>

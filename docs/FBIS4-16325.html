			<p>BFN     [Text] Newly appointed Crimean Interior Minister,  Major-General Valeriy Kuznetsov said at a press conference in  Simferopol today that his department would be working "outside  politics." He stated he did not intend to swear an oath of  loyalty to the Ukrainian people since he had already sworn the  oath committing himself to serve not only to the Crimean and to  the Ukrainian peoples but to all the peoples of the former USSR.    Kuznetsov recognized that Crimea was an integral part of  Ukraine. However, he pointed out that he was not going to  coordinate his activities with the Ukrainian president's  representatives in Crimea. "There is the Crimean president for  this purpose," he added emphasizing that he had not as yet met  the Ukrainian president's representative and that he had no  intention to do this. Kuznetsov suggested that the police must  learn to live with the authorities. "Everyone who perpetrates a  crime must be punished, whoever they may be," he said.    Kuznetsov refuted allegations that two planes with Ukrainian  special military units were heading to Crimea. He said he had  no information on corruption in Crimean law enforcement bodies,  regardless of the fact that this issue had led to the  resignation of former Crimean interior minister, Major-General  Aleksandr Plyuta. Kuznetsov also stated that there were no  Cossack military formations on Crimean territory. He did not  take seriously people in a Cossack uniform.    Kuznetsov estimated the situation in Crimea as calm and he  saw no reasons for declaring a state of emergency in the  republic. He said his appointment, although provoking  contradictory response among the Ukrainian leaders, was in  strict conformity with the law.    Major-General Kuznetsov had been the commander of the  Crimean  army corps. He had also been the Crimean president's advisor on  military issues.</p>

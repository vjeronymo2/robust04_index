The demonstrators, brandishing black flags, were activists  of  the Nepal Communist Party-United Marxist and Leninist (NCP-UML)  and other opposition groups.    Koirala, who was speaking at Mahendra Nagar, 435 kilometres  (270 miles) southwest of Kathmandu, said: "I have seen black  flags many times but such things will not disconcert me."    He said protests and slogans were not sufficient to speed  development. More important was the stability of democracy  which had been restored in Nepal after a long struggle, the  state radio quoted him as saying.    "Everybody has the right to opposition in a democracy, but I  wonder whether this right has any place in a communist system,"  he asked.    He urged Nepalese to unite to fight elements trying to  weaken  democracy.    He said communism had almost vanished from the face of the  earth and was unlikely to rise again.</p>

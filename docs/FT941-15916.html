			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Conde stands by rescue plan drawn up by JP Morgan: 'Banesto's situation did not require any emergency action' Mr Mario Conde, the former president of Banesto, the troubled Spanish bank, yesterday criticised the Spanish authorities for imposing a new management on the bank, and claimed he had been restoring it to financial health. In his first public statement since he was ousted two weeks ago, Mr Conde told a press conference he believed a rescue plan which he had presented to the Bank of Spain days before the intervention would have been successful. He still believed the plan developed with the advice of JP Morgan, the US bank, 'was the best solution for Banesto, for its shareholders, and for the domestic financial sector'. But Mr Conde said he did not intend to take legal action against the authorities. He would merely lodge a routine appeal against the intervention. He had decided against legal action because he wanted to respect the image of Spain and of its banking supervisors. 'Banesto's situation on December 28 did not require any emergency action, particularly from the point of view of its liquidity and its solvency,' Mr Conde said. He added that the bank did not require any write-down of equity under the plan that he had presented to the authorities. The intervention followed an inspection by the Bank of Spain which identified a potential Pta503bn (Dollars 3.5bn) over-valuation of its Pta7,000bn assets. Banesto and JP Morgan estimated the over-valuation at Pta372bn. Mr Conde disputed in detail the estimate by the Bank of Spain that Banesto's loan portfolio was over-valued by Pta223bn. Banesto and JP Morgan estimated the loan over-valuation at at Pta166bn. Mr Conde said that the loans had been examined and were in the process of being provisioned for. 'Our plan was exhaustively analysed by JP Morgan which estimated that our projected balance sheet was sensible and reasonable,' he said. Mr Conde rejected outright the Bank of Spain's estimate of a Pta66bn pension fund shortfall saying that an earlier inspection by the Bank of Spain in December 1992 had put the shortfall at Pta30bn and it had given eight years to make provisions for it. He also said that a Pta81bn over-valuation estimated by the inspectors last September for Banesto's industrial holding company was unwarranted as there were no legal or accounting rules that called on the bank to provide for such assets.

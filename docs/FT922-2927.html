			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Fisons warning stuns DEALERS were stunned by the profits warning emanating from Fisons and quickly responded by hacking the share price in an attempt to stave off panic selling. The extent of the market's unhappiness with Fison's management was made quite clear by the size and persistence of the selling pressure which continued to drive the share price lower as the session wore on. There had been no early warning signals to the market that profits had collapsed so quickly. Analysts scurried away to rework their profits numbers for the current and following years after the revelations announced by Mr Patrick Egan, Fisons' chairman. At the close, the shares were 100 lower at 245p, having touched 236p earlier in the session. Turnover reached 41m shares. Dealers, stunned by the waves of selling pressure hitting the market all day, said the shares would probably come under more pressure next week. 'It's got to the stage where a bid for the company would probably win acceptance from the institutions in record time,' said one senior dealer. AP Ports collapse A clutch of profit downgradings, including one from its broker sent shares in the UK's largest ports operator Associated British Ports tumbling, which affected sentiment in several other transport related stocks. By the close, the shares had fallen a mighty 66 to 344p, and had traded even lower during the session. Cazenove, the company's broker led the downgradings but cuts in profit estimates also came from UBS Philips &amp; Drew and Smith New Court, which reduced its current year estimate by Pounds 12.5m to Pounds 55, and the following year's figure by Pounds 11.4m to Pounds 67m. Mr Clive Anderson at Smith said: 'We concluded that conditions in the ports business in the first half appeared flat, and we are not aware of significant property disposals so far.' Poor sentiment resulting from the downgradings weakened a number of transport related stocks. These included NFC 6 lighter at 247p, and Ocean Group, down 9 at 274p. However, worries about the property sector and vague talk about likely downgradings that sent P&amp;O falling 28 to 460p. BP setback BP suffered one of the biggest individual falls among the FT-SE 100 constituents, with the shares closing 10 off at 261p, albeit in thin trading of 4.7m shares, after Strauss Turnbull, the French-owned stockbroker with an exceptional reputation for calling the turn in the stock, posted a sell sign over the shares. Mr John Toalster, Strauss's 'big oil' guru, cast doubts over the potential of Cusiana, BP's big new oil discovery in Colombia, and said a dividend cut by BP is deemed to be essential to conserve cash, restrict the rise in gearing and provide a breathing space to devise a survival strategy for the 1990's. The Strauss analyst summed up a dismal review of BP by saying: 'In stock market terms the recent short-lived rally has presented investors with an ideal opportunity to sell at an attractive price prior to another substantial downward rating.' The scene in the housebuilding area of the market was described by one leading marketmaker as an 'absolute massacre,' after Mr Colin Parsons, chairman of Taylor Woodrow, one of the UK's biggest housebuilding groups, warned of a reduction in its dividend payment. Taylor Woodrow shares, unsettled for some time, fell 10 to 94p and spearheaded a general plunge by a building sector seen to be on the run all week after a series of analysts' profits downgrades. In a general rout which drove many share prices to all-time lows, George Wimpey shares dropped 14 to 151p, Costain 5 to 52p, John Mowlem 9 to 120p, Wilson Connolly 8 1/2 to 179p and Wilson Bowden 18 to 405p. YJ Lovell dropped to 8p at one point before stabilising and closing a net 7 off at 11p. Persimmon dropped 26 to 257p. Broker BZW was reported to have advised investors to sell British Steel. The shares ended 2 1/2 lower at 71p as turnover reached 6.5m. Poor presentations at British Aerospace earlier in the week, leading to concern about the company's financial future, continued to dog the shares. They retreated 17 to 302p, though turnover at 1.5m was light. A Smith New Court profits downgrading in Simon Engineering left the shares 16 lighter at 252p. Mr Ian Lowe at the broker reduced his current year forecast by 10.1 per cent to Pounds 16.9m and said: 'Profits for the first half are likely to be around 52 per cent below last year's level.' A savage profits downgrading in Vickers sent the shares sliding 15 to 155p. SG Warburg cut current year estimate by a hefty Pounds 22m to Pounds 18m. Mr Rob Golding at the securities house blamed continuing weakness in the Rolls-Royce cars and Cosworth divisions. Tesco improved 7 1/2 to 276 1/2 p. It was the best performing Footsie stock on a generally dull day, as the market decided that the price/earnings differential between it and J. Sainsbury had widened too far and that Tesco was due for correction after being the weakest of the big three supermarket groups recently. Sainsbury hardened a penny to 458p, while Argyll Group slipped a similar amount to 352p. Trading in Asda was below the recent high level, but the shares remained quite active on turnover of 6.2m, easing  3/4 to 33 1/2 p, as the market continued to digest the implications of a flotation by MFI, in which Asda has a 25 per cent stake. Among food manufacturers Hillsdown lost 7 to 166p, but traders said this was not the result of any fundamental shift in the market, but was more likely to represent a badly handled selling order. Northern Foods continued to benefit from reaction to this week's good results, rising 3 to 617p. There was some relief in the stores sector that the aggressive DIY sector does not appear to be continuing its price war this weekend. Kingfisher, holding company of B&amp;Q, and recently suffering from price cutting in the DIY division, rallied 6 to 521p as traders decided that the price had probably gone too low. Dixons continued to suffer from fears of price discounting in the retail sector, after Thursday's warning about a sales setback in the CBI's distributive trades survey. The shares fell 6 to 251p. Property worries at Ladbroke caused the shares to lose 9 1/2 to 213 1/2 p. Bid speculation lifted regional brewer Devenish 9 to 278p, while its potential predator Boddington remained steady at 181p. Bank shares rounded off a thoroughly unhappy week with further losses, still weakened by Standard &amp; Poor's shift of its long term credit ratings for Barclays, NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland. Barclays fell 7 more to 342p, NatWest 9 to 329p, and Lloyds 8 to 417p. Tobacco companies were firmer as the market awaited a US Supreme Court ruling on smoking related diseases. BAT Industries gained 4 to 778p and Rothmans 'B' rose 14 to 1103p, after County NatWest argued that even if the judgment went against the tobacco companies it only gave plaintiffs the right to have cases heard by jury. Nothing will have been settled in terms of actual liability. MARKET REPORTERS: Steve Thompson Joel Kibazo, Colin Millham. Other market statistics, Page 9. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (36).

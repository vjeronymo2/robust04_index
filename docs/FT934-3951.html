			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Jump in loyalist paramilitary recruitment Recruitment to loyalist paramilitary groups has accelerated amid revelations about communication between the British government and Sinn Fein, and loyalist suspicion of the London-Dublin peace initiative, security sources believe. One assessment by the security forces puts the armed active strength of the Ulster Volunteer Force and the Ulster Freedom Fighters at about 200  - compared with 500 to 600 IRA 'volunteers'. The UVF and UFF are thought to be recruiting young, mostly unemployed Protestants, and attempting to raise funds from businesses. Mr Jim Rodgers, a Belfast Ulster Unionist party councillor who has strong contacts with the loyalist community, described official estimates of loyalist military strength as 'rubbish' and said he had information suggesting that the strength of support for the UVF and UFF was running into thousands. He said: 'The rate of recruitment at the moment is staggering. People are coming to realise that the only language the British government understands is violence and that violence is going to have to be used to prevent the majority being pushed into a united Ireland against their wishes.' Unionist politicians have frequently exaggerated the threat of a loyalist backlash. But fears about a backlash are increasing in the army. One security source expressed concern that loyalists trained in the army might take their expertise to the paramilitaries. Of the 79 terrorist killings in Northern Ireland this year 33 are accounted for by the IRA and 46 by loyalists. The UVF and UFF have concentrated on killings planned at short notice. They have so far failed to obtain Semtex or commercial explosives to carry out a large operation. Thousands of Protestants would be forced to leave Ulster within a decade of unity between north and south, Mr John Taylor, UUP MP for Strangford, said last night.</p>

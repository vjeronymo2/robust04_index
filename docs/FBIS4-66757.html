			<p>CSO     [Text] There are serious questions on what is the right and  successful approach to deal with and overcome the worsening  conditions in some public business sector companies. There are  questions on how to eliminate the bottleneck that is embodied in  reduced economic efficiency and in loss of the ability to  overcome financial, administrative, organizational, production,  and marketing problems, strangleholds, and obstacles in most  public business sector companies. How can these problems be  eliminated so as to achieve the desired reform and so holding  companies and subsidiaries can move forth and keep pace with the  economic awakening that is underlined by the public policies and  by the development and growth strategies?    Regarding an urgent prescription for reform and cure,  AL-USBU' AL-IQTISADI [Economic Weekly] has interviewed  accountant Muhammad al-Shaykh, executive vice chairman of the  Chemical Industries Holding Companies. Al-Shaykh has emphasized  a main fact that he believes is extremely significant and  without which it will be difficult to accomplish the desired  leap. This fact is connected with the inevitability of a prompt  evaluation of the capability of all leaders of holding and  subsidiary public business sector companies. This evaluation has  to be made according to scientific, sophisticated, and  unconventional criteria in order to measure accomplishment and  lack of accomplishment and so as to replace all leaders who have  not accomplished and who have not been able to rise to the level  demanded by the phase calling for a fundamental reform of the  conditions. The call for comprehensive change is not connected  with individuals. It is connected primarily to modern and  sophisticated selection criteria that focus on new and vigilant  leaders who possess scientific and technical ability; who have  international and domestic experience; who are capable of  advanced modern management; who have the potential for creative  initiatives; and who will shoulder the responsibility of  building for the future. This requires opening the way for a new  generation of leaders who believe that their future is tied to  effective and serious reform and that success is the only means  to prove their existence, to survive, and to participate  effectively in building for long periods to come.    On the basis of his long financial experience in drafting  and  reviewing the state's general budget and of the budgets and  plans of the industry sector and of public business sector  companies, accountant Muhammad al-Shaykh notes that the problems  existing in holding and subsidiary companies are of extremely  great dimensions and that a large part of these problems is the  legacy of long years of faulty policies and of procrastination  in implementing a comprehensive reform program. But the  immensity of the problems does not at all mean that reform is  impossible or unlikely. It means primarily that reform needs  leaders who are highly aware of the problems and of the numerous  solutions to deal with the problems according to the new  conditions and circumstances and according to policies that are  based on free economy and market economics--policies that are  very far from the conventional concepts that have dominated the  system of management and of dealing with the public business  sector for long years. This means that there is a need to  replace the administrative concepts and to enlist the help of  leaders capable of responding and clinging to, embracing, and  implementing the new concepts. This is because the  administrative concepts that existed prior to the liberation of  the public business sector companies are not fit or beneficial.  The conventional pattern of ministerial intervention and the  adoption of executive decrees to bolster reform are no longer  adequate, absolutely. Reform is bolstered soundly by that which  emanates from within the holding companies and subsidiaries and  from the possibilities of exploiting the available resources and  capabilities with a mentality based on dealing with the market  challenges, on competition, and on the new methods to confront  problems. This mentality makes it possible for every company to  overcome its negative conditions and to move to new and much  better conditions. This mentality achieves reform for the  companies and, at the same time, achieves the desired reform of  the general economic structure. Because of the enormous total  size of the public business sector, especially of the  production, construction, and building sections and of most of  the vital service sections, reforming this sector will certainly  reflect very positively on the economic situation generally and  will inevitably provide positive indicators that support the  comprehensive reform program. These indicators will bolster the  program, accelerate its steps, reinforce its successes, banish  many mistaken and faulty concepts from the national economy's  management, and enhance the capability and efficiency of this  management.    Accountant Muhammad al-Shaykh proposes the introduction of  prompt amendments to the executive bylaws of the public business  sector companies so as to achieve a fundamental change in the  structure of holding companies' boards of directors and so that  vice chairmen will be appointed to these boards. This is because  in all holding companies, the position of executive board  chairman has been combined with the position of commissioned  board member, thus making it possible to determine clearly the  responsibility for managing the holding company's executive work  and giving the commissioned member the opportunity to  participate in the executive board as an original member. This  combining of positions also underlines the importance of  preparing the periodic reports stipulated in the executive  bylaws on the positions of the public business sector companies  and the importance of submitting these reports to the Cabinet  regularly through the public business sector minister. The  submission of these periodic reports offers the Cabinet a  constant opportunity to familiarize itself with these companies'  problems, to debate them, and to make the necessary decisions on  them. The various ministries should be made partly responsible  for [implementing] these decisions so there will be no delay in  reform and in dealing with problems. The reports also offer the  Cabinet a full opportunity to familiarize itself with  deficiencies and flaws and with excesses and violations. They  give the public business sector minister the opportunity to  confront problems and to introduce the necessary changes among  leaders and the necessary amendments to rules and regulations.  The [new] rules and regulations are still not enacted even  though they are necessary and important for creating the desired  climate to enhance work efficiency, to free bureaucratic work,  and to enhance the level of organization and management.  Enacting the rules and regulations will ensure that the spirit  of the business sector law is achieved. It will also guarantee  the effective implementation of this law's objectives. To date,  the real situation falls far short of approaching and  accomplishing these objective capably and effectively.</p>

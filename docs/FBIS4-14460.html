			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: by correspondents </F> Dmitriy Voskoboinikov, Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoi]    [Text] "I have always supported ideas which consolidated  the Commonwealth," Ivan Korotchenya, CIS eexcutive  secretary,told Interfax Wednesday.    He described the proposal made by Kazakh President Nursultan  Nazarbayev that the CIS should be transformed into a closer  Euro-Asian Union as "exceptionally useful and sound."    Korotchenya did not know, however, what the basic  propositions the union would be dedicated to.    In his view, Nazarbayev's proposal will be discussed by the  CIS Moscow summit to be held on April 15.    "No offical documents on the setting up a Euro-Asian Union  have reached the CIS Secretariat," Korotchenya said.</p>

			<p><P> November 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> USC TOUCHDOWN CONJURES UP BITTER MEMORIES  </P> <P> USC has developed the tradition of a famous 12th man on their football field.  He's a zebra, an official who comes to the Trojans' aid with a helping hand.  Saturday he gave them a touchdown on an out-of-bounds pass. Two years ago he  did the same thing. Twice in the past he helped them win two other UCLA games  with phony pass interference calls against Terry Donahue teams.  </P> <P> He did the same thing against Tommy Prothro's teams. He did it against  Michigan, on a fumble, where the Trojan went into the end zone without the  ball.  </P> <P> Yes, USC has a football tradition, "Win it anyway we can." But the tradition  I'm proud of is, "You may be a Trojan for life, but you're a Bruin forever."  </P> <P> GENE ABRAMSON, Encino  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> REPORTER MISSED POINT  </P> <P> Reporter Gabe Fuentes missed the point of the kickoff of the Southern  California Gas Co.'s recycling program (March 27).  </P> <P> Recycling is an old issue, already in practice in many places, that is now  increasingly important.  </P> <P> It is hoped that the gas company's involvement will encourage even more  businesses and agencies to participate.  </P> <P> Beyond that, this project is a double-edged sword. It's environmentally sound.  And, by contributing the paper income to the Volunteer Center of San Fernando  Valley, it will indirectly assist hundreds of nonprofit agencies in our  community.  </P> <P> If any other businesses are interested in beginning a white-paper recycling  program, but don't know how to begin, my staff could advise.  </P> <P> SANDY DOERSCHLAG  </P> <P> Pasadena  </P> <P> Doerschlag is executive director of the Volunteer Center of San Fernando Valley  </P> <P> </P></p>

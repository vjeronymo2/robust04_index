According to Popov, the possibility that Fedorov may resign  after Gaydar and Pamfilov did "will not lead to a crisis in the  government." He views Yavlinskiy as the most acceptable  candidate for the post of finance minister.    The Director of the foreign relations department of  Stolichny  Bank, Aleksnder Skvortsov, said he hopes that Gaydar's  resignation will not be accepted. According to him, only Gaydar  can conclude the reforms launched in Russia.    The Deputy Chairman of NGS Bank, Viktor Shabrov, said that  "the policy of reforms is not carried out by one man; the  question is who will replace him."    A majority of spokesmen for commercial banks do not link the  fall of the ruble with the government reshuffling, since Fedorov  envisaged it at the end of last year. However, the rate of the  fall heightened "because of instability in the highest echelons  of power."</p>

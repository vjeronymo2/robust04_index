			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> CHILD CANCER CLUSTER GROWS  </P> <P> Another childhood cancer case has been discovered in the tiny Kern County  farming town of McFarland. The latest victim is a 5-year-old boy who state  health officials said has lymphoma. He is the 13th confirmed childhood cancer  victim in the town of 6,200 in the last 14 years. Dr. Lynn Goldman, the  epidemiologist in charge of the state investigation into the McFarland cancer  cluster, said: "I think it's an indication that the above-normal cancer rate is  continuing to occur since you don't expect even half of a case a year to occur  in a community of that size. New childhood cancer cases were found in the  community in 1987, 1988 and now in 1989." State and county officials still have  not found a clear cause for the McFarland cancer cluster and the investigation  is continuing. Goldman said nine types of cancer have been involved among the  13 confirmed cases in McFarland.  </P></p>

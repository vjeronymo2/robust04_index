			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / QE2 to sail again from October THE QUEEN Elizabeth 2, the cruise liner which hit a submerged object off Cape Cod, Massachusetts on August 7, is to resume service on October 4, Cunard, its owner, said yesterday. It will sail from Southampton on a scheduled Iberian cruise after substantial repair work at the Hamburg yard of Blohm and Voss. The German shipyard won the contract, believed to be worth about Pounds 15m, in the face of competition from eight US and European shipyards. Cunard, Blohm and Voss, and Commercial Union, the liner's main insurer, yesterday refused to release any figures, but marine sources said the combined cost of repairs, including about Pounds 2.5m of initial repair work and interruption of business, could total more than Pounds 40m. Initial repair work carried out in Boston by the General Ship Corporation has included welding sheets of steel to the centre line of the hull and parts of the keel which were damaged. The temporary work is due to be completed on September 1. The QE2 is due to arrive in Hamburg on September 7. Cunard originally forecast a return to service by early September, but has had to cancel nine transatlantic crossings, one cruise off the east coast of the US and one cruise in southern Europe. Trips on the QE2 cost from Pounds 800 to Pounds 2,000 for transatlantic crossings and up to Pounds 5,000 for cruises. The liner can carry more than 1,800 passengers. Customers affected by cancelled sailings in August and September have been offered a choice of refunds or rebooking at a discount. The company said yesterday Blohm and Voss had been chosen to carry out the main repair work on the grounds of cost and speed. The shipyard won a contract two years ago for a refit of the liner.</p>

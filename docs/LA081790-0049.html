			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS;  </P> <P> GUITARIST DAVID STAROBIN IN RECITAL AT CALTECH  </P> <P> The success of guitarist David Starobin as an interpreter of contemporary music  made his Wednesday evening recital at Caltech's Ramo Auditorium, Pasadena, an  unexpected though pleasant surprise. In a program devoted entirely to the music  of Fernando Sor and Mauro Giuliani, Starobin evidently made an attempt to  rediscover his roots in late Classical repertory.  </P> <P> His intelligent approach yielded commanding results, though the simplicity of  the music was sometimes overpowered by his innate aggressiveness. Two  diminutive guitars -- copies of instruments from the era -- brought a  provocative dimension to the music while contrasting sharply with Starobin's  large build.  </P> <P> The first half of the program, dedicated to Sor's music, romped playfully,  though less tidily than ideal. A overly romanticized, but handsome reading of  "Souveirs d'une soiree a Berlin" started off the evening, followed by five  other shorter Sor works.  </P> <P> Following an intermission, the Giuliani half explored a wider variety of moods  and techniques. Among ten selections was a work described by Starobin as "the  single most important 19th-Century guitar piece," the Variations, Opus 20. His  reverent performance of the work convincingly revealed a sophisticated  architecture of dynamics and articulations. GREGG WAGER  </P></p>

			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / PLO crisis talks as Arafat is reported missing LEADERS of the Palestine Liberation Organisation called crisis talks last night after an aircraft carrying Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO's veteran leader, was reported missing over the Libyan desert. The aircraft, flying Mr Arafat from Sudan, disappeared from radar screens during bad weather, according to the Libyan newsagency Jana. Leaders of Mr Arafat's mainstream Fatah faction of the PLO held emergency talks at their headquarters in Tunis to assess the implications. Although Mr Arafat is unpredictable and elusive, PLO leaders were seriously concerned at the lengthy loss of contact. There was no immediate suggestion that the PLO leader had fallen victim to an attack. Libya's newsagency said Mr Arafat's aircraft disappeared about 70 miles from the village of Sarra in the country's south-eastern desert. It vanished from radar screens at 8.45 pm local time. Libyan radio quoted civil aviation officials as saying that Al Kofra airport in Tripoli lost contact with the aircraft due to 'bad weather conditions'. The Libyans called for help from the International Red Cross, civil aviation organisations and bodies operating international satellites and weather stations. A sandstorm, common for this time of the year in the desert regions of the Middle East, was reported in the area where Mr Arafat's aircraft disappeared. Mr Arafat, who has been the PLO chairman since 1969, has survived a number of attempts by the Israelis and others to eliminate him. At this stage, PLO officials are not talking about foul play, but nor are they ruling out the possibility of some interference with the PLO chairman's aircraft. In Tunis, Mr Arafat's colleagues, used to his sudden disappearances and reappearances, were at first sceptical of reports that his aircraft might have gone down, but as the evening wore on without news of his whereabouts their alarm increased. The PLO leader was reported to be travelling with his usual complement of bodyguards, secretaries and personal assistants. It was not clear whether his new wife, Suha, was also on board, but she has travelled with him constantly in recent months. Among Fatah faction chiefs meeting in Tunis to discuss the latest apparent twist in the PLO's fortunes were Mahmoud Abbas and Farouk Khaddoumi, along with the PLO ambassador in Tunis, Hakem Belawi. Mr Abbas, whose nom de guerre is Abu Mazen and who is regarded as a moderate, has been spoken of as a possible successor in the event that anything happened to Mr Arafat, who was 62 last August. In Tunis, a PLO official said it was premature to speculate about a successor.</p>

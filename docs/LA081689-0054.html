			<p><P> August 16, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 2 HOUSES BURNED, 300 EVACUATED AS MOTHER LODE AREA FIRE CHARS 400 ACRES  </P> <P> A wildfire that burned two homes near this Mother Lode town grew quickly to 400  acres Tuesday, causing evacuation of 200 to 300 homes in an area of four square  miles.  </P> <P> Afternoon temperatures were near 100 degrees, and the fire spread fast and  jumped forward -- or spotted -- with the wind.  </P> <P> But about 350 firefighters, eight aerial tankers and a helicopter appeared to  be making progress against it as the day ended. They worked in a holding  pattern to try to protect the small acreage ranches, cabins and plush homes in  the region as the blaze turned the night sky into a bright orange glow.  </P> <P> "We're really slowing the fire down," state Department of Forestry fire boss  Bob Monsen said shortly before dusk. "The problem is islands of vegetation  burning out near homes."  </P> <P> Three firefighters were treated for minor injuries. Centers to receive the  evacuees were set up here and in Railroad Flat.  </P> <P> Monsen said, "We're trying to keep the fire out of the Mokelumne River  drainage. If it gets down there, we really have a mess."  </P> <P> He said that from the canyon, the fire could move down hill toward Mokelumne  Hill or up hill toward Glencoe.  </P> <P> Monsen said California 26 and 49 were closed because of the fire.  </P> <P> Department of Forestry spokeswoman Annette Shimer said the blaze was burning in  rolling Calaveras County terrain covered by grass, brush and trees.  </P></p>

			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Technology: Germany takes stock - Frankfurt is trying to shake off its Wild West image and become Europe's financial centre In Frankfurt's financial community, ambition is certainly not in short supply. Just before Rudiger von Rosen discovered that he was to be replaced as chief executive of the Deutsche Borse - which came into being at the beginning of the year - he said in a speech that Frankfurt must aim to displace London as Europe's financial centre. Von Rosen argued that Frankfurt had the means to do this because Finanzplatz Deutschland - Germany as a financial centre - had more sophisticated technology than the competition in London. Ironically, the appointment of Werner Seifert to replace him served only to make this analysis look more pertinent. Seifert, a former partner at McKinsey, the management consulting firm, is taking over precisely because of the importance of technology to the future of the Finanzplatz. The Deutsche Borse, which acts as a holding structure, brings the Frankfurt Stock Exchange - the largest by far of Germany's eight exchanges - under one roof with the Deutsche Terminborse (DTB) - Germany's screen-based futures and options exchange - and the Kassenverein settlements organisation. Germany's seven regional stock exchanges still enjoy independent lives. But they participate in the new structure to the extent that they own 10 per cent of the new structure between them and that technology developed by Deutsche Borse will be made available to them all. 'We now have one organisation to handle the entire range of stock exchange business,' says Rolf Breuer, the chairman of the exchange and board director responsible for capital markets at Deutsche Bank. 'Right from the beginning of the process of placing an order, to the end where the order is wound up, the client need only deal with one organisation. The whole process has been brought under one roof - for derivatives as well as for securities - something you don't find in London, Paris or New York.' At present, the practical benefits of the new structure for the client of a German bank or broker are few. It will be the job of Seifert, who takes over as chief executive in August, to breathe life into the new legal structure. 'This will require pure management skills,' says Breuer. 'The organisations which form the Deutsche Borse are merged together legally but not working together properly. His (Seifert's) job will be to make it all work.' Von Rosen is a former head of the Bundesbank's press office who became managing director of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in 1988. Breuer credits him with doing an excellent job in fighting the political battles necessary to bring the new stock exchange structure into existence. 'But the job is a totally different one now,' Breuer says. Even before the creation of Deutsche Borse, the development of technology had a high priority for Germany's financial community: More than DM100m (Pounds 41.6m) has been spent on setting up and developing the DTB, which celebrates its third anniversary in January. The number of contracts handled by the exchange rose from 6.8m in 1990 to 34.8m last year, confounding critics who said that a screen-based system would not function in hectic market conditions. Some DM50m has also been deployed to develop Boss-Cube, a system designed to eliminate the flow of paper involved in making an order to buy or sell securities. This was introduced at the Frankfurt Stock Exchange earlier this year and it is set to be extended to other exchanges in the future. Around DM16m has been spent on developing IBIS, a screen-based dealing system for 37 leading equities and a number of important fixed-income issues. Since it was introduced in April 1991, this has won more than 30 per cent of the market in stocks represented on Frankfurt's 30-share DAX index and become what the head of the equity derivatives department of a leading London investment bank concedes is 'the benchmark system for dealing in bigger German stocks'. Settlement procedures have been refined to the point where a buy or sell order can, in many cases, be settled within 24 hours, in all cases within 48 hours. This is markedly quicker than in London where settlement takes place up to three weeks after a trade occurs. The idea is that future technological developments will reap the synergies between these different projects. For example, following the recommendations of a study conducted by McKinsey last year, the exchange is likely to implement a more extensive electronic dealing system for shares and fixed interest securities from the middle of the decade. The technology for the new system will be modelled on IBIS and on the settlement systems already developed for the DTB. Yet for some market participants, the emphasis on technology misses the point. 'All this high-tech is quite impressive,' says Reinhard Winkler, head of the London-based Rhine Securities research house. 'But what is really needed to improve the Finanzplatz is a set of laws which bring market practices in Germany into line with the status quo in the UK and the US. There needs to be a change of emphasis, a new focus on strengthening the rights of small shareholders. 'There is a danger that the German market will degenerate into a form of electronic casino, well-equipped for the needs of professional traders but ignoring the interests of genuine long-term investors,' he argues. As Winkler points out, Germany still lacks a law against insider dealing, has no takeover code and no meaningful rules on the disclosure of share stakes, all of which gives a flavour of the Wild West to takeover activity in Germany. The principle that all shareholders should be treated equally is not an ingrained part of Germany's financial culture. Breuer concedes the justice of the criticism, blaming the government for delays in introducing the necessary legislation. Under EC legislation a law against insider dealing should have been on the statute books last summer. But this is unlikely to be enacted before the middle of next year.</p>

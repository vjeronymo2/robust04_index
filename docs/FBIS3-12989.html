			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Some 25,000 people demonstrated at Malkhey  Yisra'el Square in Tel Aviv last night in solidarity with the  massacre victims at the Patriarchs Cave. Demonstrators called  on the government to evacuate Jews from Hebron, to take steps to  renew the peace talks, and to lift the closure on the  territories. The demonstration was organized by Peace Now and  Arab local council leaders. [passage omitted]    PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat's adviser Dr. Ahmad al-Tibi says  the  evacuation of Jews from Hebron is a necessary first step to the  renewal of peace talks. Al-Tibi was asked by our correspondent  Dani Gur-Arye at the demonstration in Tel Aviv last night when  the PLO will agree to return to the bargaining table:    [Begin recording] [Al-Tibi] I don't know, it depends on the  decisions of the Government of Israel. The most and cardinal  issue now is security for Palestinian civilians. It was proven  that Palestinians are exposed to attacks by settlers, massacred,  and this issue -- security for Palestinians -- should be  immediately treated. Settlements and settlers should be disarmed  and dismantled immediately, especially settlements inside the  heart of the Palestinian population. This is a good message, a  good signal from the people here in Israel, both Jews and Arabs,  for the government of Israel, that it should do what she can do  to immediately evacuate Jews from inside Hebron as a first step  in order to improve the atmosphere for peace talks.    [Gur-Arye] You are talking about the dismantling of  settlements, but that certainly isn't a precondition for the  renewal of talks.    [Al-Tibi] The massacre created new conditions. Palestinians  are exposed now for another massacre. Can anyone guarantee that  the Palestinians could not be massacred again? Nobody. That's  why we are asking for new guarantees for the Palestinian  civilians. The Palestinian leadership is willing to continue  the peace talks because it is committed for the peace process,  but new circumstances had been created and a new measure should  be done immediately.

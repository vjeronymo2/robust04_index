			<p><P> May 1, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MUSIC  </P> <P> Unconfirmed reports say that the Los Angeles Philharmonic will today announce  the appointment of Wayne Shilkret as executive director of the Hollywood Bowl,  upon the departure of current general manager Robert Harth. Shilkret will  report to Philharmonic Managing Director Ernest Fleischmann. As executive  director of the Ambassador International Cultural Foundation -- sponsor of  concerts at Ambassador Auditorium and other major local halls -- for the past  12 years, Shilkret, 55, has long been Fleischmann's only major rival in  Southland impresario ranks. He will reportedly take over the job at the  Hollywood Bowl -- which Fleischmann has run since 1969, but in recent years  with strong assistance from Harth -- next spring. Harth is leaving the  Philharmonic after the 1989 Bowl season to become president of the Aspen Music  Festival in Colorado. Both Fleischmann and Shilkret were unavailable for  comment this weekend.

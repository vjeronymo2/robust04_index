			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Daimler-Benz plans radical shake-up to revitalise AEG AEG is to sell its household appliances business to Electrolux of Sweden in a radical shake-out designed to return the lossmaking Daimler-Benz subsidiary to break-even in 1995. Other projects outlined by AEG yesterday include joint ventures with General Electric of the US, a new structure for its railways operations, collaboration deals and the disposal of 'fringe' businesses in lighting and meters. Mr Georg Stockl, AEG chairman, said the changes would reduce turnover from DM11bn last year to DM9.3bn (Dollars 5.5bn) and the payroll from 60,000 to 48,000. In future, the company would be known as AEG Daimler-Benz Industrie, he said. The plans are central to the restructure of Daimler-Benz, Germany's biggest industrial concern. Daimler, which expanded vigorously from the mid-1980s, when the management decided to construct a world-class high-technology group, is further reducing its range of activities. Its Deutsche-Aerospace (Dasa) subsidiary recently announced the closure of six German factories and sites and warned of further possible cuts if conditions failed to improve. Last year AEG closed Olympia, its lossmaking office equipment business. Daimler is also striving to generate more market strength in sectors which it considers core to its main concerns through partnerships and strategic alliances. Mr Stockl said a letter of intent had already been signed with GE for the US group to take a majority stake in AEG's low voltage switchgear business. GE was also to manage a joint venture embracing both companies' interests in drives automation. Although AEG is known to be seeking a partner for its lossmaking DM1.5bn a year railways business, the current focused is to reduce costs by DM180m a year. Projects include the closure of one factory and job cuts. Further cost savings are expected from intra-group deals under which AEG is to take full control of Daimler's microelectronics business. At present it has an equal share in Temic Telefunken with Dasa. The high-performance diesel engine activities of MTU, also part of Dasa, are to be rolled together with AEG's in a business employing 5,300 with sales of about DM1.5bn. Mr Stockl gave no details of the price expected for the appliances business, in which Electrolux already has a 10 per cent stake, but said the Swedish group had agreed to keep open the company's three German factories. Completion of the deal depends on approval by the European Commission competition offices, but early signals are that the authorities are satisfied there is enough competition in the field, such as Whirlpool and Bosch-Siemens, to prevent problems. The deal would give Electrolux an estimated 35 per cent of the German white goods market, compared with 20 per cent today, and would boost its share of the European market to some 30 per cent from 25 per cent. The group does not foresee regulatory problems, partly because most of its sales in Germany are generated through an intermediary called Quelle, which is free to choose a different supplier.</p>

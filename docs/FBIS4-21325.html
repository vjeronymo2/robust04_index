			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  narcotics reports from the Danish press from 23 March through 10  April.    Police seized drugs, precursor chemicals, and two pistols in  a raid on an amphetamines factory in the Zealand Island city of  Roskilde on 23 March, following an investigation that began last  fall. So far, 11 persons have been arrested. "Many of those  charged have especially close ties to known rocker [motorcycle]  groups in the Copenhagen area," according to a police official.  In previous amphetamines factory cases, members of the Hell's  Angels gang, including a former president, often figured  prominently. It is generally believed that precursor drugs for  Danish amphetamines factories are brought in from Germany and  Poland, where they are easily purchased.

A  minesweeper is joining the search for hashish dumped overboard  by the coastal boat Hela on 3 April as police cutters approached  to search the vessel off the south coast of the island of Funen.  The search for Kim Julskov Knudsen, age 41, the supposed  ringleader and previously convicted drug smuggler, is  continuing, according to police. The minesweeper Flyvefisken was  tasked to join Navy divers, who have already hauled up over  5,000 kg from the bottom of Helnaes Bay. Authorities plan a  thorough search before reopening the waters to sport diving.

He was sentenced in 1987 for acting  as a courier of heroin from Pakistan and was imprisoned for five  and a half years. (Copenhagen BERLINGSKE TIDENDE in Danish 8 Apr  94 p 4)    A 29-year-old man from Funen was sentenced in Grasten for  having smuggled narcotics over the border from Germany. Over 50  grams of amphetamines and 1,270 LSD capsules were found in his  residence. (Copenhagen BERLINGSKE TIDENDE SONDAG in Danish 10  Apr 94 p 2)    Illegal drug use among refugees and recent immigrants is  believed to have greatly increased in recent years. This problem  was discussed at a Copenhagen meeting of drug treatment  officials, physicians, and police. While no nationwide  statistics have been gathered, the chief physician of the  Copenhagen Health Department stated, "We suspect that the  problem is growing. We are hearing from more treatment  institutions that they have an overrepresentation of  immigrants." He cited language and cultural isolation among this  population group as a main factor, and urged that this be taken  into account in organizing prevention and treatment programs.

			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / International Company News: French may accelerate sell-off MR JEAN-RENE Fourtou, chairman of Rhone-Poulenc, the French state-owned chemicals and pharmaceuticals producer, yesterday said he hoped the group would have a core of loyal institutional shareholders if privatised. Mr Fourtou's remarks, following his election as French manager of the year, are the latest evidence that the public sector is preparing itself for the acceleration in the France's privatisation programme promised by the right wing if, as is likely, it wins next March's legislative elections. Rhone-Poulenc, already partly quoted, would be a prime candidate for further privatisation as its profits are rising and it is eager for fresh capital to reduce FFr32bn (Dollars 6.14bn) of debts, the legacy of a series of acquisitions, climaxing with the takeover of Rorer, the US pharmaceuticals company, two years ago. The former Gaullist government was careful in its last privatisation programme to leave candidates with decisive minority shareholdings in the hands of investors loyal to government policies and to the companies' management. However, some economic liberals in the UDF, such as Mr Herve de Charette, one of its vice-presidents, are now urging that future privatisations should have more open and diverse shareholding structures. If elected, the right is aiming to sell between FFr40bn and FFr60bn per year of state company shares, starting with the banks and insurance companies.</p>

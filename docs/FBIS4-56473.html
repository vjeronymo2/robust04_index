			<p>BFN     [Text] Violent clashes between workers and police during  the general strike ended yesterday with the provisional result  of one peasant dead and some 30 individuals injured and bruised.  According to several sources, this was the first general strike  in the country in 36 years.    The three labor federations, CNT [National Workers  Federation], CUT [United Workers Trade Union Federation], and  CPT [Paraguayan Confederation of Workers], said the strike was  "a total success," adding that the measure was respected by 80  to 85 percent of unionized workers and employees. President  Juan Carlos Wasmosy, Interior Minister Carlos Podesta, and  Justice Minister Juan Manuel Morales said the strike was a  "total failure."    Workers started mobilizing on the night of 1 May.  Demonstrations became more serious during the morning when  unionized workers occupied strategic points of access to the  capital, Ciudad del Este, and Hernandarias, among other  crossroads.    According to spokesmen for public transport companies, bus  drivers halted most of the bus service in the capital and Ciudad  del Este around midmorning because demonstrators were attacking  buses.    The Army moved tanks from their base in Cerrito to the 1st  Corp barracks. An armored helicopter overflew highways entering  the capital and over Calle Ultima, alarming the population for a  couple of hours.    Student Sebastian Larrosa was shot in the head and died  instantly during the blockade and march on Highway 3, near  Tacuara, some 200 km north of Asuncion, yesterday morning. ABC  COLOR journalist Mariano Godoy was wounded in the back by  another shot during the same demonstration.    Police Superintendent Pablo Villar, Public Relations  Director, confirmed the death of the student following a clash  with security forces. He also reported that six policemen were  wounded during the clash. Peasants were dispersed with tear  gas. Interior Minister Carlos Podesta emphasized that the  peasant demonstrators used guns against the police first.    NOTICIAS reporter Celso Aguilera witnessed the incident and  told radio stations that two peasant demonstrators were wounded  in the forehead and the right arm, respectively.    Aguilera said: "An ABC COLOR colleague and I mingled with  the  peasants to take pictures but I withdrew from the area when I  saw the police were going to use force to repress the  demonstration. I saw the police turning their weapons on the  peasants." Police Superintendent Villar said four policemen  were wounded in the capital.    In Ciudad del Este, striking workers demonstrated through  the  city center and blockaded streets until they were repressed by  the police. ABC COLOR, NOTICIAS, and ULTIMA HORA reporters and  photographers were hit and bruised during the repression. Some  500 strikers gathered in Pedro Juan Caballero. Liberal Party  Mayor Filemon Valdez criticized them for their lack of numbers.  In Encarnacion, the strike was 60 percent effective but there  was no violence.    Transport Vice Minister Juan Wenninger said some 200 buses  were damaged by stones thrown by demonstrators, adding that  passengers were injured by flying glass. President Juan Carlos  Wasmosy, speaking in Uberaba, Brazil, where he is participating  in a cattle fair, said: "The strike was a failure." According  to the Federation For Production, Industry, and Trade (Feprinco)  the strike was 50 percent effective.    Early on 2 May, students who joined the strike burned tires  on Eusebio Ayala Avenue, outside the Asuncion National  University university campus.    Army Communications Director Colonel Carlos Medina issued a  message around noon yesterday saying that the Armed Forces were  ready to support the police if they were overpowered by  demonstrators.    The police fired into the air and used water cannons against  demonstrators who tried to prevent the movement of vehicles in  various points of access to the capital. Buses practically  stopped operating after the initial confrontations.    CUT President Alan Flores asked workers demonstrating on  Calle Ultima to move to the Fetraban [Bank Workers Federation]  headquarters for an afternoon rally once the news of the  peasant's death and the wounded in Tacuara became known. Flores  characterize Wasmosy's government as "fascist" after witnessing  what he thought was excessive police violence. "Only the  totalitarian minds of people who understand state terrorism can  accept the shooting of a fellow worker for the simple act of  demonstrating," Flores said.    Secretary General Eduardo Ojeda said he regretted the  incidents, adding that the protest was organized "to dignify the  working class." Paraguayan Industrial Union President Arturo  Jara Avelli blamed the violence on strikers and characterized  their leaders as "union terrorists."    Industry and Commerce Minister Ubaldo Scavone reported that  commercial activities dropped to 60 percent of usual levels. He  added, however, that 90 percent of shops and industries opened  their doors. Most parents in the capital and the interior of  the country preferred not to send their children to school to  avoid the risk of violence or for lack of transportation.</p>

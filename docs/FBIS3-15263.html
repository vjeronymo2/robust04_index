			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Valentin Ovsyannikov "Commentary": "Is Alliance With NATO </F> Affordable?"]    [Text] The strategic "Partnership for Peace" program  approved at the January NATO summit is taking on real outline.  A number of countries have not taken time out for lengthy  contemplation of the proposed plan but have hastened to take the  opportunity. The number of signatories to the framework  document of the "Partnership" is already approaching 10,  including Romania, Lithuania, Poland, Hungary, Estonia,  Slovakia, and Latvia. The first from the CIS is Ukraine.    In their statements at the signing ceremony officials from a  number of the aforementioned states intimated that they have not  renounced their long cherished idea of full NATO membership, and  so the signing of the program is seen as the first step toward  achieving the coveted aim, which will certainly facilitate  integration into Western Europe. For instance, Hungary sees  itself in the first group, and the Czech Republic and Poland  also aspire to this. Romania is concerned at the prospect of  ending up in the group of "laggards."    In this connection it is timely to recall that the  alliance's  partners should not expect dividends alone, as their  participation entails commitments, including financial ones.  Material outlay will vary according to the specific content of  bilateral agreements (joint military exercises, the  standardization of armaments, the implemenation of scientific  research, and so on). The state coffers will have to earmark  around $50 billion for the relevant measures announced by Poland  in this sphere in 1994, for instance. Obviously, such sums are  beyond the reach of countries in the East which are not  experiencing the best of times. This, in turn, will determine  the pace at which they become involved in the activity of the  Western bloc.    But what kind of peace does the program promise our country?  The Brussels concept is aimed at developing the partnership  relations and practical cooperation with all European CSCE  member states, including in the East of the continent. We  welcome this approach, and we are prepared to become a  responsible and keen partner of NATO. Our stance is that the  transformation of the European security system should be  approached in a balanced and gradual manner. It is also  necessary to ensure the openness of regional organizations and  institutions and to guarantee an equal level of security for all  European countries without any "differentiation." It is a  matter of forming a really pan-European security system, of  joint, collective resistance to any new threats to stability on  the continent, and of the worldwide strengthening of the  potential of the CSCE, under whose auspices other European  structures would also function -- namely, the EU, NATO, NACC  [North Atlantic Cooperation Council], WEU [Western European  Union], and CIS.    Russia's stance is evaluated positively by Western official  circles, which believe that security in Europe is impossible  without or in defiance of Russia. Developing it, the advocates  of constructive cooperation with Moscow urge that every effort  be made to attain a strategic partnership with Russia. Nothing  must be done, they warn, to damage its political stability or  reinforce the "besieged fortress syndrome" which continues to  exist in influential military circles.    Unfortunately, the Cold War left deep scars on the minds  and mentality of Western politicians. How else can the  following comment be explained. For instance, NATO Secretary  General M. Woerner said in the lobbies at the Brussels summit  that in order to establish an "honest partnership" with the  alliance Moscow must continue democratic reforms and renounce  the idea of expansionism. The "resolute" warnings of Belgian  Foreign Minister W. Claes are even more perplexing. If Moscow  continues in the same vein and alarm signals continue to come  in, he declared, then NATO may accelerate steps aimed at  integrating the countries which meet the required terms for  entry into NATO.    You get the impression that it is to the advantage of some  people in the West to remain deaf to all Moscow's arguments  based on international law. This is the theme which Foreign  Minister A.V. Kozyrev developed in his article entitled  "Partnership for a United, Peaceful, and Democratic Europe,"  published in THE WASHINGTON TIMES. In it the leader of the  Russian foreign policy department shows that Russia's foreign  policy has already demonstrated that it is geared toward  achieving national interests through partnership and not  confrontation with the world. This policy is enshrined by the  new democratic Constitution. Russia, in his words, has no  territorial claims against any country in the world, including  the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. Moreover, its new  military doctrine gears the Armed Forces exclusively toward  defending Russia and its allies, and also toward participating  in peacemaking operations in line with international commitments.    It is also well known that Russian President Boris Yeltsin  sent a letter to FRG Chancellor H. Kohl. In it the Russian  leader gives assurances that he will not heed those who are  calling for a nationalist or imperialist policy to be  implemented.    The West is now trying a different tack, attempting this  time  to cast doubt on Moscow's desire to officially formalize its  participation in the "Partnership for Peace." According to the  Western mass media, Moscow is sending out contradictory signals,  and confused Western leaders cannot fathom whether Russia is  interested in joining the aforementioned initiative. For  greater cogency, references are made to alleged differences of  opinion on this subject within the Russian Federation leadership.    A Foreign Ministry representative at a recent briefing  dispelled doubts about the Kremlin's true intentions and  confirmed our positive attitude toward the program. He  explained that the Russian side will soon hold talks with a  delegation of NATO experts during which it is planned to discuss  plans for Russia to join the program, to obtain explanations  from NATO officials, and to propose its own scenarios for  cooperation. In particular, we will put forward our proposal  that partnership develop on the basis of the NACC, in which  neutral states could play a full part. The main forum within  which key problems of partnership will be thrashed out will be  meetings between ambassadors and permanent representatives,  while the practical implementation of its decisions will be  entrusted to a political-military steering committee subordinate  to the NACC.    In this way the process of elaborating a strategy of  European  partnership will develop.</p>

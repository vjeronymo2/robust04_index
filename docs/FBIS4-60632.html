			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Joint" statement issued by the AMU Presidency; place and </F> date not given -- live or recorded]    [Text] The AMU states -- Tunisia, Algeria, Libya, Morocco,  and Mauritania -- have been following with great concern the  serious developments in Yemen. The mass destruction resulting  from the fighting between brothers -- for which the brotherly  Yemeni people, above all, are paying the price -- is awakening  the Arab and Islamic conscience with its ugliness.    The AMU states -- while warning yet again of the risks of  this escalation that will harm the brotherly Yemeni people's  gain of unity, in addition to the disastrous repercussions on  peace and stability in the region that will result -- again urge  all the Yemeni brothers to immediately halt the bloody  confrontation, to return to reason, and to act in a spirit of  responsibility, so that the way is cleared for dialogue on a  peaceful settlement to the crisis in order that history may  record it for the faithful sons of Yemen.</p>

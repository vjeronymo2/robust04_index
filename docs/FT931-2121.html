			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / Letter: EC integration has not led to a more protectionist stance Sir, the EC is the world's largest importer and exporter of merchandise, even excluding trade among member states. It is therefore befitting that its commercial policy be subject to close scrutiny. I feel that the recent study by Prof Winters, as reported by David Marsh ('Single Market Watch: Europe turns inward', February 22), does not scrutinise adequately. The study argues that the economic effect of EC integration has been far less positive than often argued, for two reasons. First, the EC has become increasingly protectionist. Second, the process of EC integration is inherently biased toward protectionist outcomes. However, during the period 1980-91, domestic suppliers' share of the total of processed products consumed has steadily declined in member states (from 67 to 56 per cent), while the shares supplied by EC partners and non-EC partners have both risen (from 19 to 25 per cent and 14 to 19 per cent respectively). This reflects a lowering of the average of external protection for total processed products, rather than the alleged increase. The opposite holds, though, for processed agricultural products. Here, the share of consumption supplied by extra-EC partners has actually declined (from 7 to 6 per cent), presumably as a result of the Common Agricultural Policy. The study's second allegation is that a coalition of states with a common external trade policy, like the EC, will automatically favour protectionist outcomes. Prof Winters has clearly in mind the 'fiercely protectionist' CAP. Although there is no denying that levels of external protection have been high under the CAP, one cannot be sure that they would have been lower in the absence of the EC. The example of Switzerland and the Nordic countries, which protect their agriculture even more than the EC, suggests that the answer is not as evident as the author would have us believe. My assessment of the impact of EC integration differs substantially from that of Prof Winters. While he feels that the EC may have succumbed to the 'danger of becoming inward-looking', I see a process of regional integration having led to substantial multilateral liberalisation, beyond what could have happened without the EC. Reinforcement by the EC of its commitment towards the multilateral trade system is the best way to ensure that integration will continue to be beneficial to both the EC itself and the world at large.

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Jakarta, Jun 21 (OANA-ANTARA) -- Cambodia wants  to learn about reorganizing its armed forces and dealing with  separatist movements by studying Indonesia's own experiences of  post-independence restructuring, said Minister/State Secretary  Murdiono. [passage omitted]    On the possibility of Cambodia joining the Association of  Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Ranariddh said that the issue  is still being debated.    He said that he has received strong support from some ASEAN  member countries.    When asked whether or not Cambodia will attend the ASEAN  Regional Forum (ARF) meeting in Thailand next year, the prime  minister simply said that his country has clearly expressed its  interest in attending the meeting.    "We have support from Indonesia and Malaysia. I do not know  about the other countries such as the Philippines," he said.    "But, I should say that we have not yet received an answer  from the host country (Thailand) about our attending the ARF,"  he added.    The Cambodian co-prime ministers and their entourage are  scheduled to visit the Indonesia Aircraft Industry (IPTN) and  the Asia-Africa Museum in Bandung on Wednesday.</p>

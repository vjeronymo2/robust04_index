			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, March 30 (TANJUG) -- President of the  Lower Chamber of Yugoslav Parliament Radoman Bozovic has said  that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia urges an unconditional  end to all armed conflicts in the former Yugoslav republics of  Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, and a lasting solution founded  on principles which will be equal for all warring sides.    Speaking to a delegation of the lower chamber of Russian  Parliament, headed by Sergey Baburin, Bozovic said that  Yugoslavia was an example how the strength of the world's powers  was demonstrated through international sanctions as an  unprecedented form of violence against innocent civilians.    An entire nation, Bozovic said, is punished because the  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia urges the respect of the right to  self-determination for all peoples in the conflicts in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia.    The Russian parliamentarians pointed out the united stand of  all parliamentary political parties of the lower chamber on the  Yugoslav crisis and the necessity to lift the international  sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. They said  they were certain that Russian parliament would soon pass a law  on their lifting and that the latest initiatives by the Russian  Government would step up this process in the international  community.    The MPs assessed that the world community had violated the  principles of international law by recognizing the  disintegrations of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and  the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and had thus  triggered a serious crisis in international relations. Along  these lines, they underscored the necessity for establishing a  new system of collective security, having in mind the national  interests of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Russia.    The Russian parliamentarians were also received by Serbian  Vice Premier Slobodan Radulovic. During these talks, the two  sides set out the complementarity of the economies of Russia and  Serbia and the mutual interest for cooperation to continue.    Vice President of the Socialist Party of Serbia Goran  Percevic underscored the important effect Russia had had on  securing a more balanced approach to the resolving of the  Yugoslav crisis and said he was certain that Russia would  continue to act in this direction.</p>

			<p><P> April 18, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> GLEN BROWDER TAKES SEAT IN HOUSE  </P> <P> Democrat Glen Browder was sworn in today as the House's newest member,  replacing veteran Rep. Bill Nichols (D-Ala.), who died in December.  </P> <P> Browder, who won a special election April 4 to take the Third District seat,  took the oath of office from Speaker Jim Wright in the well of the House. The  margin of Browder's victory over Republican state Sen. John Rice -- 65% to 35%  -- was a surprise and a blow to Republican hopes to end its minority status in  the House. The current breakdown in the House is 260 Democrats, 174 Republicans  and one vacancy.  </P></p>

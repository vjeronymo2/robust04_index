			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets: Bullion worries pressure South Africa Johannesburg was under pressure from the sharp losses on Wall Street and gold price weakness, leaving the overall index 38 lower at 5,616. Industrials declined 31 to 6,270 and golds receded 34 to 2,366. Spot prices were less sensitive to the negative sentiment than futures, however, where near term index futures posted steep falls amid concern that gold's expected break above Dollars 400 an ounce would not materialise. South Africa's split country ratings from S&amp;P and Moody's did little to spur investment, although analysts expected that the country's forthcoming inclusion in emerging market indices could prompt renewed interest. De Beers slipped R1 to R101 and Anglos fell R1.50 to R236.50. Minorco lost R1 at R110. Barlows retraced some of its recent steady gains, giving up R1 to R30. SAB eased 50 cents to R83.50 and Sasol was off 25 cents at R35.75.</p>

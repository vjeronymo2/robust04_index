			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Chuan Hsun-che (0278 6061 5074): "High-Ranking </F> Military Officers on Use of Force Against Taiwan"]    [Text] In late February, the division-level party  committees of various armed services, various arms of the  services, and various major military regions transmitted  Document No. 9405 which was issued by the CPC Central Military  Commission General Office; they also organized discussion  meetings. The CPC Central Military Commission General Office  demanded that, through studies and discussions, the document be  implemented throughout the Army and viewed as the central task  and duty.  <H5>  Themes of the Document Issued By CPC Central Military </H5> Commission General Office    Document No. 9405 was a general report on: A speech by Liu  Huaqing, of the Central Military Commission, made on 9 February  when he met the division-level cadres of the three armed  services in Xiamen; a speech by Air Force commander Cao  Shuangming during an inspection trip to Shanghai Air Force Unit;  and a speech by 2d Artillery Corps commander Yang Guoliang when  he inspected a certain missile unit in Zhejiang. The themes of  their speeches were: Develop and improve modernized equipment  for the three armed services amid the reform and make  preparations for counterattacking the subversion and destruction  from hegemony as well as its military threat; and stress that  hegemony, Japanese militarism, and Li Teng-hui's "Taiwan  independence," "one China and one Taiwan," and two-China  policies are the main enemies facing the three armed services.  <H5>  "Use Military Means To Settle Taiwan's Separation" </H5>   Liu Huaqing said when meeting the division-level cadres of  the three armed services: Whether a war will break out across  the strait depends to a large extent on Li Teng-hui and the  governing stratum in Taiwan. We do not want to see war breaking  out across the strait because war will bring harm and  destruction to the Chinese nation but this cannot be determined  by our subjective expectations. The biggest sorrow and  humiliation to a country and nation is its being split up and  its invasion and occupation by other stronger powers.  Concerning Taiwan, we have waited for 45 years and we can still  wait, but this kind of waiting cannot be endless, nor can it be  taken as tolerance of the activities promoting "Taiwan  independence," "one China, one Taiwan," and two Chinas, or  allowing foreign forces to intervene in Taiwan. Whether or not  we will use military means and when we will use them depends on  the development of the abovementioned matters. Taiwan is openly  opposed to using the "one country, two systems" method of  reaching reunification and this openly indicates that: Taiwan  wants to follow the road of "Taiwan independence" in the future,  a road which will lead to a test of military strength between  the two sides of the strait. Li Teng-hui also pins hopes on the  subversion of the mainland by the United States and the West as  well as the interference and peaceful evolution being carried  out by them. Judged from the development of things, the use of  military means to settle Taiwan's separation is the eventual and  only choice. When we use military means to settle reunification  of the two sides of the strait and crush "Taiwan independence,"  we must mainly consider the interests of the broad masses of  patriots in Taiwan, the degree of loss to the economic  construction in Taiwan, and the price we have to pay in military  and economic terms. We made preparations regarding this point a  long time ago.  <H5>  Three Urgent Reasons For Developing the Air Force </H5>   Air Force Commander Cao Shuangming made a speech to Shanghai  Air Force Unit when a number of China-made J-18 II aircraft were  commissioned into the unit. In a speech entitled: "Expedite  the Building of a Modernized Air Force," he stressed the urgency  for developing the air force:    1. It is to defend the motherland's territorial airspace and  safeguard the socialist undertaking;    2. It is to resist hegemony and the aggression and  interference of neighboring countries; and    3. It is to prepare for accomplishing the great undertaking  of reunification of the motherland and for crushing "Taiwan  independence" and the invasion of Taiwan by foreign countries.  <H5>  Cao Shuangming: "There Is No Other Choice" </H5>   Cao Shuangming pointed out that Li Teng-hui is stepping up  the effort to develop in the direction of "Taiwan independence"  and to enlist and collude with the anti-China and anti-communism  forces in the United States and Japan, in an attempt to turn  Taiwan into an international dispute, reach the goal of  separating Taiwan from Chinese soil. If things develop in this  direction, we cannot other than adopt resolute and decisive  military means to liberate Taiwan. There is no other choice.</p>

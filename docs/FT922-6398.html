			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Labour scorns Gummer 'euphoria' MR DAVID CLARK, Labour agriculture spokesman, yesterday dismissed the 'euphoria' shown by Mr John Gummer, agriculture minister, over the CAP deal. 'All the evidence we get is that the consumer will not benefit,' Mr Clark said in the Commons. He also said that the deal would not benefit small farmers. There were protests from Tory MPs when Mr Clark referred to a 'suspicion' that Mr Gummer had sold out small upland farmers to the 'barley barons in East Anglia'. In a statement to MPs, Mr Gummer was adamant that his negotiating stance had safeguarded the position of the British farmer and ensured that those in the hills and upland areas would be 'more directly supported'. Mr Gummer was praised by government supporters for the substantial British contribution to the reform package agreed in Brussels on Thursday. They enthusiastically endorsed his claim that it represented 'a major step forward for Europe, for Britain, for British consumers and taxpayers and for British farmers'.</p>

			<p><P> December 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEHIND THE WHEEL: IN TUNE WITH THE SPIRIT OF THE SILVER GHOST  </P> <P> Safety commandments haunt the 83-year-old Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost.  </P> <P> Thou shalt not exceed 40 m.p.h.  </P> <P> Thou shalt not drive on public roads without a blocking car up front and a  buffer car behind, both by Rolls-Royce.  </P> <P> Thou shalt not allow the Silver Ghost to be driven by anyone outside its elite  cadre of Rolls-Royce handlers and feeders.  </P> <P> On the other hand, if the early morning is peaceful and if one driver's vintage  car credentials just happen to meet the approval of Rolls-Royce Western Zone  Manager Christopher Brown, and if the guardian spirits of Rolls, Royce and  Johnson are slumbering far from Southern California. . . .  </P> <P> "But you'd better let me start her," says Brown. "This can get a little  tricky."  </P> <P> True. If elopement or convenience market robberies be your thing, do not rely  on the Silver Ghost for getaway. Starting is far from turnkey: It is more of a  mid-term exercise at MIT after translation from the Queen's mechanical English.  </P> <P> First, the clutch pedal is unchocked. The mahogany block keeps the pedal and  cone clutch disengaged when the car is at rest. Otherwise, the clutch will  stick to the flywheel.  </P> <P> The petrol tank is then pressurized to 1 1/2 psi by a hand pump (silver plated,  of course) in the cockpit. Next, open the bonnet and prime the carburetor bowl  by hand.  </P> <P> Fuel-air mixture control, set. Magneto switch, on. Trembler coil switch, on.  Governor control lever, set. Ignition advance and retard lever, set.  </P> <P> Then, if your riding mechanic has not left for lunch, it is his (do not expect  many female volunteers for this job) honor to lean into a crank and push  against the compression of six fat cylinders until the engine fires.  </P> <P> When it does, it purrs. But not exactly a whisper. More like the snore of a  Bengal tiger. Regular. Purposeful. Also not to be disturbed until one knows  exactly what to do when the owner comes awake.  </P> <P> Undivided attention, of course, is the first dictate of driving the Silver  Ghost.  </P> <P> It has four forward gears and one reverse gear, and that seems about as normal  as anything from Chevrolet. But the shift pattern is more of a U than an H.  </P> <P> In addition, the gearing was assembled decades before the luxury of  synchromesh. That means digging into misty personal lore to recall the  hand-foot coordination of double clutching a crash gearbox.  </P> <P> Even with that antediluvian instinct exhumed, smooth shifting remains more a  matter of matching the noise of the gears with the breeze on your cheek.  </P> <P> The Ghost has a hand brake and a foot brake, and there should be nothing  complicated about either -- except the foot brake works against the drive  shaft. It's good only for speeds barely above walking pace. Any serious  stopping must be done by hauling on the hand brake.  </P> <P> The steering wheel is round, wooden and routine -- but the steering itself is  leaden and as direct as a wheelbarrow.  </P> <P> The Silver Ghost has three horns -- two bulb hooters and an "oogah" under the  bonnet -- and no known reason for this rude trio.  </P> <P> Abundance ends there. Apparently, $80 million doesn't even buy a heater, turn  signals, radio, seat belts, canvas top or a driver's side door. And the hood  emblem is an Automobile Assn. badge because Flying Ladies didn't come in until  the '20s.  </P> <P> Yet somewhere between Coast Highway and the paths lacing Newport Dunes --  somewhere in that time warp between 1907 and now -- the magnificence of the  Silver Ghost resurfaces.  </P> <P> The engine -- six huge cylinders in tandem -- may only be developing 48  horsepower. But it is chuffing along, turning slowly and never missing a beat.  You just know that if the Atlantic weren't in our way, this car would carry us  to Brighton.  </P> <P> The brakes do require some planning ahead, each gear shift is a matter for deep  thought, and the steering does get a little wobbly around 40 m.p.h. But every  shortcoming is constant and absolutely predictable -- and, after all, the car  is doing a genuine 40 m.p.h. With a lot left.  </P> <P> Brown, resplendent in linen cap, goggles and duster, doesn't flinch at being  asked for corporate approval to attempt an acceleration run. Piece of cake, old  boy.  </P> <P> So the old girl winds up and whines like a London double decker bus. There are  mild lurches and a slight clunks going through the gears to fourth. But the car  tops 30 m.p.h. in 17.3 seconds. We chortle. The Silver Ghost remains quite  unruffled.  </P> <P> But that must be it. There is no reason, only a distinct lack of respect, in  further testing the past of the Silver Ghost. After all, she is 83 years old  and a long way from the comforts of home.  </P> <P> Also, she always gets a little creaky and rheumatic in Southern California's  winter clime.  </P> <P> It's her wheels. They're spoked and wooden, and accustomed to the humidity of  England. In California, the joints start to dry out and separate.  </P> <P> Says Brown: "If we were here much longer, she'd have to stand with her feet in  bowls of warm water."  </P> <P> 1907 ROLLS-ROYCE SILVER GHOST  </P> <P> COST:  </P> <P> * Base, and as tested: $40 million (including wooden artillery wheels,  running-board lockers and spare Dunlop tire without wheel).  </P> <P> ENGINE:  </P> <P> * Six cylinders (in two blocks of three), in-line (with two spark plugs per  cylinder), and 7.046 liters developing 48 horsepower.  </P> <P> TYPE:  </P> <P> * Open touring, front engine, rear-drive, three-door, five-passenger heirloom.  </P> <P> PERFORMANCE:  </P> <P> * 0-30, as tested, best of one run on Jamboree Road, 17.3 seconds.  </P> <P> * Top speed, as recorded at Bexhill, London, in 1907, 52.94 m.p.h.  </P> <P> * Fuel economy, as measured on a 2,000-mile run around Britain in 1907, 23.25  miles per Imperial gallon.  </P> <P> KERB WEIGHT:  </P> <P> * 3,646 pounds.  </P> <P> THE GOOD:  </P> <P> * Perfect for royal weddings, dinner at Hearst Castle, leading the Rose Bowl  Parade or driving Princess Daisy.  </P> <P> * Guaranteed "Best of Show" at Pomona Valley Auto Faire.  </P> <P> * Comes with permanent lease-rental retainer from producers of "Masterpiece  Theater."  </P> <P> * Two-owner car with only 600,000 miles.  </P> <P> * No biennial smog checks required.  </P> <P> THE BAD:  </P> <P> * Collision insurance includes a $5-million deductible.  </P> <P> * Cannot be driven through a carwash. Or Seattle.  </P> <P> * No valet parking.  </P> <P> THE UGLY:  </P> <P> * Thinking that in 1950 it might have been flattened into scrap, shipped to  Japan and made into a Honda.  </P></p>

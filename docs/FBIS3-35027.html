These demands have either obstructed or provoked a  stalemate in the negotiations since they began as a series of  rounds more than two years ago. This is also happening in the  new format, which is meant to serve as a prelude for more rounds  and is confined to the heads of the delegations.    Negotiations in the new format stopped for two weeks at  Israel's request. This gave the impression that Israel might  change its negative position. But no sooner had the  negotiations resumed than Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin  began to play the same old tune -- played earlier by Foreign  Minister Shim'on Peres -- of calling for secret talks, upgrading  the level of the talks, and spelling out the concept of peace.  This confirms in advance that Israel does not have any serious  desire to see the Washington talks reach positive results.    Rabin knows all attempts to hold public or secret talks with  Syria will fail. His recent insistence on this confirms that  Israel is still determined to defeat the formula that is the  basis of the Madrid peace conference and the peace talks,  evading the foundations of a just, comprehensive solution in the  region. Israel plans to do this by taking on the Arab parties  one at a time, as it did with the secret Oslo talks.    The Arab parties went to the Madrid conference and the  Washington talks in order to achieve a just, comprehensive peace  in the region, based on the implementation of Security Council  resolutions. Throughout the past 12 rounds, the Arab parties  have emphasized that peace cannot be achieved without Israeli  withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories.    On the eve of the resumption of the bilateral talks in  Washington, Rabin has reiterated his preconditions about what he  calls Syria's spelling out the concept of peace. Obviously,  Rabin's aim behind this is to obstruct and prolong the talks,  keeping them spinning in a vicious circle to deflect them from  their desired goal.    Since the Madrid conference, Syria has emphasized its desire  for, and efforts to achieve, a firm, lasting peace in the Middle  East. This peace is founded on the exchange of land for peace.  During the sixth round of the Washington talks, Syria presented  a paper based on the relevant resolutions of international  legitimacy. Israel, however, is still evading the Madrid  formula and the comprehensiveness of the solution. Israel  refuses to declare its willingness to withdraw from the occupied  Arab territories.    Syria, through President Hafiz al-Asad, said in Geneva that  peace is not a transitional aim, but a strategic option. This  clear, unequivocal Syrian position was welcomed and appreciated  by U.S. President Bill Clinton and the world at large. Israel  alone is still trying to circumvent the results of the Geneva  summit.    Israel is mistaken if it thinks that it can impose its  conditions and continue to adopt a hard-line, inflexible  approach, maneuvering, casting doubts, and double-dealing.  These methods are now exposed to the whole world and will only  pass up the current peace opportunity, on which the Arabs and  the world pin great hopes for a just, comprehensive peace in the  region.</p>

			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / International Company News: CME, Matif in Globex link THE CHICAGO Mercantile Exchange and the Matif, the Paris futures exchange, are to tap into each other's products on the electronic after-hours trading system, Globex. The Matif began listing on Globex in March, but trading on the French futures and options products has been limited to Matif members. Starting today, US and French futures traders will have cross-exchange access. 'Cross-exchange access is the next logical step in the internationalisation of Globex,' said Mr Jack Sandner, Globex chairman. UK futures traders with Globex terminals are still without access to the Matif products, because the cross-border transactions lack the necessary UK Treasury approvals. The Matif is the only non-US exchange to have signed on to Globex, a joint venture between the CME, the Chicago Board of Trade, and Reuters. The year-old system averaged 20,000 per session in June, with more than two-thirds of the volume made up of Matif contracts. The CBoT will continue to list July, August, and September futures contracts for the high-cap stock index, but has delisted its December and March and June, 1994 contracts. Its agreement with the Amex expires in October, when the contract will presumably move to the CME. The American Stock Exchange has confirmed it is to end its 10-year relationship with the Chicago Board of Trade as licensee to trade futures on Amex's Major Market Index. Mr Howard Baker, senior vice-president of the Amex, said the exchange was negotiating an agreement with the CME, subject to legal and regulatory approvals. While MMI futures generated very little volume for the CBoT, loss of the contract is a blow to the exchange's prestige.</p>

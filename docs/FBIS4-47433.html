Sechenov]    [Abstract] Clinical trials were conducted with the  polymeric adsorbent regenkur (previously designated tselosorb;  weakly crosslinked cellulose ester) in the management of  infected wounds. The patient cohort consisted of 60 men and  women 20 to 80 years old with a variety of infected soft tissue  wounds. Conventionally treated patients (42) with analogous  lesions served as controls. The polymeric dressing was  pretreated with 3% hydrogen peroxide and applied to wound  surface in 2-3 mm thickness held in place by gauze. The number  of changes per day varied from 3 to 14 for an average of 6.5.  After 3 to 5 days (average 4.6 days) the experimental group  showed significant reduction in bacterial wound contamination,  followed by onset of granulation (4.3 days) and peripheral  epithelialization (6.5 days). The duration of the hospital stay  of the regenkur group was reduced by a third in comparison with  the control patients. Thus, regenkur was shown to be an  effective adsorbent promoting the removal of bacteria and  exceeding the efficacy of the Swedish adsorbent debrizan [sic]  (Pharmacia).

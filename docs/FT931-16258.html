			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / County Hall hotel proposal approved LAMBETH Council has approved a planning application by Shirayama Corporation of Japan to turn County Hall, the former headquarters of the Greater London Council, into a hotel. The council's planning committee gave permission to a planning application at a meeting on Tuesday evening, subject to further consideration later this month of the community benefits the developer will provide. The developers plan to convert the building into a 600-bed hotel with conference and leisure facilities. Shirayama says it will keep all the historic rooms intact and 'brought back to their original splendor'. There will be a chapel and a health club in the basement and a 24-hour public restaurant on the riverside terrace. The council was advised to accept the planning application for a number of reasons, including the need for high-quality hotel accommodation in London and employment potential. The council originally wanted to keep the building in local government or public use, favouring a proposal by the London School of Economics to acquire it. The acrimonious battle between Shirayama and the LSE over the future of County Hall ended last September when the government rejected the LSE's bid. Shirayama is contracted to complete its pounds 65m purchase of the County Hall riverside building at the end of October. The London Residuary Body which has the task of disposing of the GLC's assets, launched an international marketing campaign for the remainder of the 5-hectare site last November.</p>

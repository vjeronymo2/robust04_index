			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Canadian Government appoints prominent Winnipeg businessman The Canadian government has appointed a prominent Winnipeg businessman to oversee a new effort to dismantle pervasive non-tariff trade barriers between the country's 10 provinces, reports Bernard Simon in Toronto. Mr Arthur Mauro, former chief executive of Investors Group, Canada's biggest mutual fund distributor, will chair the Internal Trade Secretariat, which was set up earlier this year so as to co-ordinate domestic trade liberalisation. The federal and provincial governments have set a target of June 30, 1994, for a 'single-market' agreement. Most observers expect, at best, limited results by then. The Canadian Manufacturers' Assocation has identified about 500 provincial trade barriers, including government procurement preferences, product standards, marketing boards and curbs on labour mobility.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Zheng Hongye, chairman of the China Council for the  Promotion of International Trade, and his 20-member Chinese  economic and trade delegation, visited the Council of Trade of  Thailand [CTT] on 31 May. The delegation was warmly welcomed  by Acting Chairman of the CTT Zheng Weichang [Thai name: Wichian  Techaphaibun] and other CTT executive members.    In his welcoming speech, Zheng Weichang said: The CTT  chairman asked me to receive you because he is leading a  delegation on visits to Western European and South American  countries. I, on behalf of the CTT, extend a warm welcome to  the Chinese economic and trade delegation. The CTT and the  China Council for the Promotion of International Trade have  maintained close contacts for a long time. CTT Chairman Suwit  Wangli led a delegation to visit China last year in July. The  visit achieved great success because of the assistance provided  by the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade.    Zheng Weichang continued: I am very glad to learn that your  delegation is visiting Thailand to open the Thai-Chinese  International Trade Promotion Center. The CTT would like to  take this great opportunity to welcome this cooperation between  the two sides. This is a concrete achievement of trade,  business, and investment cooperation between Thailand and China.  I wish this joint venture bright prospects and great success.    After that, the CTT hosted a luncheon in honor of the  guests.  The two sides exchanged views on trade and investment between  the two countries.</p>

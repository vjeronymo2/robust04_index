			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Juan Manuel Alvarado] </F>   [Text] Lacandona Jungle, (APRO) [expansion unknown] --  Subcommander Marcos, spokesperson for the Zapatist National  Liberation Army [EZLN], said that the only ones to gain from the  murder of Luis Donaldo Colosio [Mexican Institutional  Revolutionay Party, PRI, presidential candidate] are those  pressure groups that are opposed to peace. Monsignor Samuel  Ruiz, the bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas, warned of the  danger of destabilization.    In an interview on the night of 23 March on the outskirts of  a town in the Lacandona Jungle, Marcos said that "at the  beginning Colosio was a sure thing to be elected for Carlos  Salinas de Gortari's position. However, he began to change his  discourse and his line of action. The ruling pressure groups who  have always opposed the peace talks in Chiapas are the ones who  gain from this action. The EZLN loses, mediator Samuel Ruiz  loses, and peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis loses."    He explained that the country now faces a crisis, not only  within the PRI campaign but also within all the other parties,  which will now have to redefine their strategies. Marcos said  the upcoming political changes were the result of the 1 January  armed uprising. He said the Colosio he saw on the campaign trail  was always wise in addressing the EZLN. "He never spoke of us as  criminals. As I see it, he had begun to steer away from the  Salinas strategies. He was trying to draft his own ideas and to  recognize that there are in fact very deep social problems. The  Zapatists had seen the face of Salinas de Gortari in the PRI  presidential candidate -- the same economic plan with the same  political ties and similar social cost," Marcos said. "But he  had tried to change that. We do not know what will happen now  that he has died."</p>

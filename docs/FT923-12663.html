			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Bundesbank rate up to 8.75%: Europe's central banks braced as German move sends shudder through markets EUROPEAN central banks will today attempt to maintain their resistance to upward pressure on interest rates following yesterday's monetary tightening action by the German Bundesbank. The Bundesbank's increase in the discount rate by a larger than expected 3/4 point to 8 3/4 per cent, sent a nervous shudder through foreign exchange and securities markets yesterday. But with Britain and France both refusing to follow the German lead, the Bundesbank failed to touch off a generalised increase in European interest rates. The Bundesbank, at a meeting of its 18-man central bank council, raised its main rate for lending to banks in a determined signal of its desire to damp domestic inflation and monetary growth. But it also sought to mollify its European partners by keeping unchanged its 9 3/4 per cent Lombard rate, which has a greater impact on money markets than the discount rate. The only exception to the generally unruffled response was the increase in the Bank of Italy's discount rate to 13 3/4 per cent from 13 per cent to defend the lira. Belgium and the Netherlands, which closely follow the Bundesbank's moves, made only smaller technical increases in central bank lending rates. The German discount rate now stands at its highest since September 1931. The continuous rise in German lending rates during the past four years ranks as the longest in German monetary history. Currencies within the European Monetary System managed to shrug off the Bundesbank increase, while the US dollar and the Japanese yen both lost ground in the aftermath of the decision. Sterling strengthened against the D-Mark in New York at DM2.8666 against DM2.8472 on Wednesday. The Italian lira was little changed at L758.8 to the D-Mark compared with L761.65 on Wednesday. The dollar lost 2 pfennigs in the immediate aftermath of the Bundesbank announcement, but recovered later on news that Mr Ross Perot was withdrawing from the US presidential race. The Bundesbank admitted that it had reflected on the pressure from the rest of Europe not to trigger interest rate rises in countries with weaker economies. 'We considered very carefully the impact of this measure on our partners,' Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank's president, told a press conference. 'Our measure mainly had domestic targets in mind, namely reducing the rise of the money supply in its present magnitude.' Mr Schlesinger denied the Bundesbank wanted a realignment of currencies in the European Monetary System, saying any initiative was up to its partners. This year, M3, the broad measure of money supply, has been rising at an annualised rate of around 9 per cent against a target range of between 3.5 and 5.5 per cent. 'The expansion of M3 is too strong,' Mr Schlesinger said. By raising the discount rate, the lower of its two key rates, the Bundesbank intends to make it more expensive for commercial banks to obtain central bank funds and thus curb high lending to companies and individuals. The strong rise in bank lending, much of it to finance investment in east Germany, is one of the main reasons for the steep increase in money supply. Since investments there are subsidised heavily, past interest rate rises have had less of an impact than they would otherwise have had, Mr Schlesinger said. The rise in the discount rate by as much as 0.75 percentage points - against a generally expected half a point - showed the Bundesbank's concern about inflation and its determination to keep its tight monetary policies on course. 'The Bundesbank has had on the brakes for a long time and nothing has happened, so it has raised rates again,' said Mr Hermann Remsperger, chief economist at BHF-Bank. 'It is something more than just a symbolic measure.' Other economists felt the Bundesbank should have waited for expected lower inflation figures for July - the June rate was an annual 4.3 per cent.</p>

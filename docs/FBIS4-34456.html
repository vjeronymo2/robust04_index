			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech to the nation by President Cesar Gaviria; place not </F> given -- live]    [Text] Colombians: In spite of our sadness, I want to speak  briefly with you tonight to tell you that we must not lose our  faith and hope. This country has known how to successfully face  adversity in the past. I am sure that as long as we don't lose  confidence in our potential, we have what it takes to come out  winning.    Once again, I reiterate my invitation to my fellow  countrymen  to exercise their constitutional right to vote in tomorrow's  election. It is the duty of each and every Colombian who is  eligible to vote. The right to vote is free and voluntary. It  is a reaffirmation of our democratic and participative vocation.  He who votes must do so based on his own dictates and  convictions. This is a right that makes us masters of our fate  and interests.    We again have before us the opportunity to participate in  the  presidential election; the most important political decision in  our country for the next four years. The runoff mechanism is  another result of the important changes introduced by the new  Constitution. The National Government will once again ensure  total and complete impartiality and will exert strict control to  guarantee transparency in the development of these elections.  We will demand that political parties, the media, and citizens  fully comply with the existing norms on behavior. Any attack  against the right to vote freely will be severely punished as  stipulated by the law.    Compatriots, we are experiencing moments of great enthusiasm  and credibility in the country. We have again overwhelmingly  demonstrated our solidarity when thousands of Colombians  suffered the unexpected and brutal attack by nature a few days  ago. Although our team lost its first game, we have faith,  trust, and conviction that it will recover in the games to come.  Victory alluded us today, but we are sure that our boys will  know how to achieve the results we all hope for.    The faith, trust, and conviction we have in them is what we  must show at the elections tomorrow. I hope that the force  accompanying the Colombian team will be equaled by that which is  deposited in the ballot boxes in every corner of our nation. As  president, I address my fellow countrymen and invite them to  vote with the assurance that you will exercise your right to  freedom appropriately. Thank you and good night.</p>

According to revised but still not final data which  was released by the Northeastern Geological Committee, last year  the oblast turned over to the state 28,561 tonnes of gold  (29,156 tonnes in 1992). During the 11 months the  Severovostokzoloto produced 22,502 tonnes (25,262 tonnes in all  of 1992). Gold mining cooperatives and new gold-producing  structures which do not belong to the Severovostokzoloto  produced 4,773 tonnes (3,894 tonnes). According to Vladimir  Banin, deputy head of the Magadan Oblast Administration, there  are grounds to believe that not all of the metal produced last  year has been turned over to the state yet.</p>

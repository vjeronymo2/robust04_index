			<p><P> September 23, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DISCOVERY: HOME DESIGN;  </P> <P> HOUSE OF CACTUS  </P> <P> Back in the '70s, Richard Hipp recalls, there were a dozen or more Orange  County nurseries specializing in cacti and succulents. But spiraling land costs  forced others to pack up and move out, making Hipp's Stanton shop the last of a  breed.  </P> <P> House of Cactus has occupied its spot on Beach Boulevard since 1959 (for 18  years it was called Black's House of Cactus before the original owner sold to  Hipp). Outside, a desert mural graces the stucco walls; inside, more than 1,500  varieties of cacti and succulents are offered for sale.  </P> <P> In his 12 years running the shop, Hipp has seen some changes in the cactus biz.  Collecting cacti in the wild is now heavily regulated and in some cases  forbidden by the federal government; meanwhile, importing cacti and succulents  for retail sale has also been outlawed.  </P> <P> That means most new specimens must be propagated from seeds or from cuttings.  Because most cacti grow slowly, it usually takes at least two years before they  are salable, and even then they are tiny. The popular saguaro, for instance,  grows about one inch a year. Thus, Hipp said, "large plants are in very short  supply" -- especially with the recent interest in Southwestern home decor.  </P> <P> Hipp buys many of his plants from wholesale suppliers, but propagates many of  the rarer and more unusual specimens himself. He works the shop alone, usually  with an emerald green conure parrot named Mikey perched on his shoulder. His  wife, a hospital dietitian during the week, helps out on weekends.  </P> <P> While much of the store's stock is inexpensive, Hipp also offers a number of  rare specimens with price tags running into the hundreds of dollars. Collectors  will pay the premium prices, Hipp said. "It can become quite an obsession." He  held up one small plant, a brand-new variety with only a few specimens known,  priced at $175. "If you want to be first," he said, "it is expensive."  </P> <P> Hours: 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily (closed Monday)  </P> <P> Address: 10580 Beach Blvd., Stanton  </P> <P> Telephone: (714) 828-4298  </P></p>

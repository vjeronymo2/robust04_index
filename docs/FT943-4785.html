			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Mexican banking chief sought on fraud charges The Mexican government has ordered the arrest on fraud charges of Mr Carlos Cabal Peniche, head of one of the country's largest banking groups and of Del Monte Fresh Produce, the international fruit company once owned by Polly Peck International. The finance ministry immediately took over Mr Cabal's Banca Cremi and Banco Union - which have combined assets equivalent to nearly Dollars 11bn (Pounds 7bn) and deposits of Dollars 9.8bn - and their subsidiaries, including a foreign exchange house, and leasing and factoring companies. It said the alleged irregularities suspected so far did not affect the banks' ability to meet their obligations, but all depositors would be protected under the law. A government official said yesterday that Mr Cabal had not yet been apprehended, with reports circulating that he may be in Europe. However, the official said that four of Mr Cabal's senior executives had been arrested, and about 10 people connected to the case were in custody. The first casualty of the charges against Mr Cabal may be his intended purchase of Del Monte Foods, the San Francisco-based canned food company. In June, Mr Cabal and his investor group agreed to buy the US company for Dollars 277m in cash and about Dollars 700m in debt. However, according to Mexican government officials, the transaction has not yet been Mr Pedro Aspe, Mexico's finance minister, announced on Monday night that the attorney-general's office had issued an arrest warrant against Mr Cabal, accusing him of having illegally lent himself money from his banks to acquire various business interests. Mr Cabal is being sued by Eastbrook, a now defunct US trading house, which alleges that he defrauded it of Dollars 70m of loans. Mr Cabal has vigorously denied these allegations.

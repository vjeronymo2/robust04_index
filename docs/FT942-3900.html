			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Management: Quitting to pursue other euphemisms Let me take this chance to wish John Precious, the outgoing finance director at Wellcome, every success in pursuing his other opportunities. I am, however, curious to know what they are. They must be pretty special to have persuaded him to quit a prestigious job with a salary of Pounds 200,000 or more. I would like to know, and I think shareholders have a right to know, a little more about why he is leaving. When a director quits his post suddenly it is not good enough for a company to offer a limp cliche by way of explanation. I'm sure there is nothing untoward about Precious's departure - especially as he has kindly agreed to stay put until a replacement can be found - it is just a shame that Wellcome chose to explain his departure in woolly terms guaranteed to raise the suspicions of sceptics. 'Pursuing other opportunities' or 'interests' can mean that the guy was no good and has been fired; that he disagrees with the company's policy; that he cannot get on with his colleagues; that he has had a better job offer; or that he has had a mid-life crisis and wants to generate his own electricity on a farm. The phrase is just one in a collection wheeled out for senior resignations and sackings. Some directors who depart in a hurry cite a desire to 'spend more time with the family', while others refer to 'clash of management styles'. This last one is less opaque, as it usually means there has been a mighty row. The reluctance to explain is regrettable. It is also understandable. Celsis, a biotechnology company, recently fired its chief executive claiming that his performance had been wanting. Now the company is being sued both for unfair dismissal and defamation. It is a pity that the law encourages companies to mince their words. Directors are paid a great deal of money, and if they do not deliver the goods they deserve to be sacked, and shareholders deserve to be told about it. If truth were the norm, there would be no niggling suspicions when a director genuinely found that the pull of those other interests was irresistible. I was intrigued to read that the president of the Board of Trade is considering an investigation into the affairs of Impregnators Ltd. It seems there was an ugly scene at the company's agm, with shareholders making allegations and directors stonewalling. What surprised me about this snippet was that it appeared in the June 7 1944 edition of the Financial Times reprinted last week. According to the rest of the media's D-Day extravaganza the world has changed beyond recognition in 50 years, but the old copy of the FT proves that, in business, matters are much the same. In addition to the thoroughly modern tale of corporate corruption, the news of 1944 included familiar sounding payoffs to directors losing their jobs. The stories may be the same, but the way we tell them is not. In those days there was no need to present events as exciting, nor to explain them. Neither was there a market for clever comment. Autolycus, the Lex of the time, spent D-Day explaining that J. and J. Coleman was shortly to go ex-dividend, and forecast that the share price then would be the same as today, minus the dividend - unless there was any 'change in the meantime'. I'm not sure if today's ultra-discerning readers would feel happy paying 65p for that insight. Over breakfast the other day I found myself having a row with my husband over the unlikely issue of absenteeism. The discussion was amiable enough until he declared that women were off sick more than men. To prove him wrong, I phoned the people who research this sort of thing, like the Confederation of British Industry and the Institute of Personnel Management, to find they had no relevant figures. That didn't stop them speculating: some said it was the men, others that it was the women who were the skivers. Finally, I tracked down an unpublished study at the Equal Opportunities Commission showing that women are off sick 5 per cent of the time, while men are only off 4 per cent. I would have let the matter drop quietly had it not been for the explanation. The difference is entirely due to women staying at home to look after sick children. 'Just what I thought,' said my husband, when I triumphantly presented the evidence. I wonder how many men take time off having been assaulted by their wives? Still on the subject of the sexes, the Equal Opportunities Unit in Brussels takes a novel approach to the differences between them. Prospective employees must complete a form that asks them their sex, giving them the option of m or f. The corresponding footnote explains: 'Indicate your choice'. This is the last week for nominations for the FT Mean Boss Award. The winners will be announced on June 20.</p>

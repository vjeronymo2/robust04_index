			<p>BFN     [Text] Five days after the terrorist attack of the Greek  commando unit against a military objective within our territory,  during which two of our officers were killed and three wounded,  this unprecedented event continues to be at the center of  domestic and foreign mass media reports. The People's Assembly  discussed this criminal act again today. In today's  proceedings, in the name of the government, Foreign Minister  Alfred Serreqi presented a report concerning the Albanian-Greek  relations in the light of the present crisis. Our reporter,  present at today's session, has prepared the following report:    The 10 April tragic event continues to be at the center of  our public's attention. After the official pronouncement and  that of the various political forces, associations, etc. at  today's People's Assembly session, in the name of the government  Foreign Minister Alfred Serreqi spoke about Albanian-Greek  relations in light of the recent events. In his speech to the  deputies he said:    [Begin Serreqi recording] As I will shortly summarize, the  course of Albanian-Greek relations, as neighboring countries and  peoples and as the most ancient peoples in the region, shows  that the general framework of interstate relations is at first  view characterized by several zig-zags and oscillations. In its  essence, it has, however, some constants and several conditions  that should be accepted and objectively and realistically  assessed. On the basis of mutual efforts and reciprocal  interest and respect, efforts should be made to smooth out these  zig-zags, and if possible to eliminate them.    I should first assert that Albania has put an end to  isolation once and for all -- the isolation of its policy and  the Don Quixotism of the policy of drop dead toward the whole  world. Albania is simultaneously liberated from that illusory  naivete so that we will ensure a continuous and permanent  assistance from everyone, without a justification and motivation.    What are those circumstances that have conditioned and still  condition Albanian-Greek relations?    I would say that first, it is the reality of present  Albania,  of an Albania that has taken the road of democracy, an Albania  that is already passing the transition successfully and is  accomplishing the market economy.    Second, it is the internal Greek reality, of which I hope  that you have been informed.    Third, it is the fact that we are neighboring countries, and  between neighboring countries relations of neighborliness are,  of course, liberated from the illusion of good unconditional  neighborliness. Of course there are problems, however, between  neighbors and these problems should be overcome.    I want to stress that there is a very important thesis,  i.e.,  the stance toward the crisis in former Yugoslavia which, despite  the actual elements, is taking proportions almost similar to a  Balkan crisis. In connection with this, I want to differentiate  what is the stance toward the great all-national Albanian  problem.    Finally, I should take into consideration the circumstances  that Greece is the only Balkan country, member of the European  Union, which is not running successfully the presidency for its  six-month period. Greece is a NATO member -- even this is a  circumstance that should be considered. There is also another  very important circumstance -- the admission of the early  Albanians in Greece and the admission of the Greek minority in  Albania.    Of course, the policy of a state, its philosophy toward the  minority, and the democratic dimension of a society can turn a  minority into a communication bridge that eases relations, but  simultaneously can turn it into a Trojan Horse or a factor that  aggravates them.    There is also another problem. It is the Cam problem, which  is put forward by the diplomacy of the democratic government and  which should not be ignored. There exists another circumstance  which has influenced, though not little, the Albanian-Greek  relations -- the mentality, technocratic philosophy, and the  influence of the Greek church in the entire policy of the Greek  state, the Greek Government, and the attempts to infringe the  autocephaly of the Albanian Church.    At the same time, there are circles and mentalities which  are not liberated from historically known prejudices of the  Greek policy, such as expansionism and the North Epirus claims.  We are all informed that certain circles, which can by no means  be believed when they claim to be completely unsupported or only  partly supported by the Greek Government, follow a policy with a  [word indistinct] tendency in that sphere that they consider to  be their area.    In connection with this, it is not at all difficult to make  an analysis how the assistance is spread. Not only in the  humanitarian aspect, but also concerning the activity of the  economic assistance and the Greek business in Albania, we will  observe a geography that does not conform to those criteria and  priorities that our country possesses for the northeastern  areas, as the areas with the most difficult situations and the  most backward areas from the economic point of view.    It is clear to all that the Greek side has not had a  demarcation line and a clear attitude between economic  cooperation with Albania and the efforts to exploit this with a  [word indistinct] tendency. In connection with this, I want to  stress that Albania, as I first said, is not at all against  cooperation and harmony in all fields. However, from now on, as  Albania has always considered this, but from now on more  clearly, Albania will separate what is called a cooperation with  the one that is called Hellenism.    Another element that should be considered is the presence of  the Albanian economic emigrants in Greece. No one from us here  wants Albanian-Greek relations to bring economic consequences to  the Albanian families. On this occasion, I want to avail myself  of the opportunity to thank the generosity of the Greek people  who have welcomed the Albanian emigrants at this difficult  period of transition and in a way have eased those economic  difficulties that our country was encountering during this  period.    At the same time, I want to make clear that the Albanian  economic emigration is not at all a source of the increase of  crime in Greece, a claim which has been several times put  forward by the Greek side. I want to remind you that if we make  an analysis of the Greek emigrants in other countries, we will  recollect that at its peak, the Greek emigrants in the United  States have the responsibility for the highest crime rate in the  United States, as the Italian emigrants kept it at the time of  its highest peak in Italy.    Thus, if we consider all these conditions and factors that  condition Albanian-Greek relations, we would say that in the  relations between Albania and Greece, there has been a constant  that, if at first looks like a zig-zag -- sometimes very good  and sometimes very aggravated relations --, this is an illusory  conclusion. There is a dimension that is connected to the  internal situations, there is a dimension that is connected to  bilateral relations, there is a dimension that is related to the  regional situation, and there is a dimension that is more widely  connected to our whole continent.    First, I want to stress once again that, as we all know, the  unprecedented terroristic act that occurred on 10 April can be  blamed on the Greek Government. I do not consider it as  lightning that strikes in a cloudless sky, but as part of the  wave of previous events. I want to stress that all the Albanian  political forces in general have agreed with the way the event  has been treated. Perhaps there may be a difference in approving  or not the reactions of the Albanian Government and in the  degree of responsibility of the Greek Government.    The thing that strikes you most is the reaction or  non-reaction of the Greek Government, the fact of not taking the  responsibility, the absence of cooperation needed to throw light  on the event, something that may have been partly corrected  after the reactions of the Albanian Government, reactions that  are already known. I hope there is no need to discuss it any  longer.    What are the recent events? The recent event is the proposal  that came through the diplomatic channel from the Greek  Government to cooperate in a joint commission that will  investigate and examine the event in detail, and a proposal for  a meeting between the foreign ministers in a neutral country or  at a multilateral activity.    Concerning these two proposals, because as I mentioned  above, the policy of closing has finished for us, we are for  dialogue and for overcoming the difficulties, considering that a  tension in the south will highly aggravate the situation in the  region.    Concerning these two proposals, the Albanian Government has  answered positively, both for the joint investigation of the  event and a possible meeting between foreign ministers. I have  proposed a meeting in Bucharest on the occasion of the activity  of Crans Montana, where I am invited and I will attend.    Regarding the international reaction, you know that the  whole  problem is up for discussion at the Security Council and it will  be examined at a meeting of European Union foreign ministers.  The case is put forward in the CSCE structures and the High  Commission for Human Rights. Generally speaking and in a clear  way, it results that the act has been condemned, the  responsibility of the Greek Government has come out clearly, and  the stance of the Albanian Government has been approved.    In conclusion, I judge that we should have no complexes and  debasements, as the country's sovereignty, the fate of  democracy, reform, European integrity and above all the grand  pan-Albanian problem cannot pass through any capital of the  world, cannot pass through any party in the world, whatever and  wherever it can be, even less through Athens and through PASOK  [Pan-Hellenic Socialist Movement]. They are more than ever in  the hand of the Albanian democratic sovereign state and of the  Albanians everywhere in the world, as history [word indistinct)  years. Thank you. [end recording]    The People's Assembly ended proceedings for this week. The  next session opens at 1000 on Wednesday.</p>

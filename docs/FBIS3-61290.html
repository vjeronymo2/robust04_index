The main conclusion I drew from my conversation with  the new minister: He would be glad to help the press, which is  suffering a financial collapse, but his possibilities are not  great. So, poor brother journalist, as they say--the minister  helps those who help themselves....    [Andreyev] Leonid Aleksandrovich, I will not undertake to  speak for the entire journalistic fraternity, but I personally  do not understand why our Moscow Ministry of Press and  Information was created.    [Belov] Our department is not an ideological department like  the former division of propaganda of the party gorkom [city  committee], which at one time was in charge of the media and  adjusted their political line. On the whole, the ministry's main  task is to provide for constant information communications  between the residents and the government of Moscow. Muscovites  must know about all steps and decisions taken by the government,  and it, in turn, must adjust its socioeconomic policy taking  into account the demands and opinions of the city residents. We  maintain close contacts with all departments of the mayor's  office and government and with the prefectures, we conduct  sociological research, and we regularly publish collections of  information on various aspects on the life and activity of the  city. The mass media are a most important part of our work: the  newspapers, magazines, radio, and television. And of course  printing, dissemination of printed products, and the information  and artistic arrangement of the city.    [Andreyev] Many new Moscow newspapers, including KURANTY,  have ended up in an extremely difficult material position. Is it  possible for them to count on any support from your ministry?    [Belov] By a directive from the top official of the  government, Yuriy Mikhaylovich Luzhkov, benefits that give them  a break on the rent for their premises have already been  established for the editorial offices of all Moscow newspapers,  including KURANTY. Our department is now considering the  question of the possibility of reducing charges for electric  energy for printing facilities, which consume a very large  amount of it here, and this, of course, will have an effect on  the cost of printing services and newspapers.    [Andreyev] All of the so-called independent newspapers are  still dependent as long as they do not have their own premises  and printing base. Could the Moscow government not make a  goodwill gesture during these days that are so difficult for  newspaper people: turn modest premises and a printing base over  to them to be owned by them free of charge?    [Belov] I do not rule out such an arrangement regarding  premises, but I do not want to get your hopes up: The market is  the market, you must earn money and support yourself in  interaction with commercial structures. Now about the printing  base. It is in a most difficult position. The Moskovskaya Pravda  publishing house, where the majority of Moscow newspapers and  magazines are printed, is not owned by the capital but is  federally owned. The money is pumped out of it and there is  practically no help from the Russian authorities. For this  reason the publishing house is unable to complete capital  construction, make current repairs, or purchase new equipment.    [Andreyev] Why does the capital government not get the  Moskovskaya Pravda publishing house turned over to Moscow  ownership?    [Belov] This question has been raised repeatedly with the  Russian government. The mayor has just received a negative  response to his last letter.    [Andreyev] God forbid, but let us say that the Moskovskaya  Pravda publishing house was over-strained and stopped  functioning. Are there any alternative plans?    [Belov] We are taking all possible measures to launch a  second section of the Chertanov printing base, but things are  very tight with money. We are conducting negotiations with the  Moscow Business Bank and foreign companies. Perhaps they will  become involved in this matter.    [Andreyev] At one of the recent sessions of the capital  government your department was given a good dressing down for  poor street advertising in the capital. What a strange  combination--the press and advertising. Is it really not  possible to create a specialized advertising office?    [Belov] There is a state (municipal) enterprise called  "advertising-service." The task of our department's advertising  division is to develop and implement a standard advertising  policy which would meet the three requirements set by the  capital's mayor: It must be attractive, information-filled, and  advantageous. And the main thing is that the advertising that  interests Muscovites should be not only in the center, on Tver  Street, but in all the administrative and municipal districts.  Taking Western experience into account, we have prepared a  concept of advertising and it will soon be considered by the  capital government.    [Andreyev] For two years in a row with the participation of  the Department of Press and Information winter evening balls for  journalists have been held in the mayor's office on Novyy Arbat.  Will this tradition continue?    [Belov] We intend to have another ball but we do not yet  know  where. We have to lease premises and find sponsors.    [Andreyev] Previously, Leonid Aleksandrovich, you were  deputy  chairman of the Moscow Soviet. Which position do you like better?    [Belov] I like better the lively, specific work which is  conducted in the executive structures. You see the results of  your work more quickly here, and that is stimulating.    [Andreyev] All Muscovites hope that the new organ of  representative power--the City Duma--will not become a mini  Moscow Soviet, that it will really think reasonably and calmly,  but work effectively for the good of the city. What do you have  to say about this?    [Belov] I too hope that Moscow will finally have a normal,  effective representative power. But this can happen only with  clear-cut delimitation of functions between the Moscow  government and the Duma and also with the highest degree of  responsibility on the part of deputies for the decisions that  are made.</p>

			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / International Company News: HK Land is 'relaxed' with stake in Trafalgar HONGKONG Land, which has a 14.9 per cent stake in Trafalgar House, is unlikely to buy any more shares in the property, construction and engineering group for at least another five months. Mr Rodney Leach, a director of Hongkong Land who joined Trafalgar's board last month, said: 'We are not trying to buy more shares; we have no bids in the market. 'While we made no secret of our desire to have a bigger stake than 15 per cent we are very relaxed with our current holding.' When Warburg Securities, acting for Hongkong Land, offered 85p for the ordinary shares and 82p for the A shares on October 1, it said Hongkong Land would not buy shares above these prices for six months. This has effectively underpinned the Trafalgar share price. The ordinary and A shares closed on Friday at 84 1/2 p and 81 1/2 p respectively. Mr Leach said Hongkong Land would look again at whether the group wanted to buy more shares next year. He was careful, however, not to close the door on the possibility of increasing the stake before next April, although he said it was not his intention to do so. Hongkong Land's main priority over the next five months is to get another of its director, Sir Charles Powell, to join Trafalgar's board. Mr Leach, who is also a director of Jardine Matheson, said his group's involvement in Trafalgar should not be seen as a prelude to making an outright bid for the company. 'This is a long-term investment. We are not in the business of taking stakes as a prelude to making bids. We do not take the cheap expedient way. We are interested in what the profits of Trafalgar will be in five years time.'</p>

			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Italian deputies back single round electoral reform THE Italian parliament yesterday approved electoral reform for the chamber of deputies with the adoption of a first-past-the-post system for most seats in a single round of voting. Parliament also decided to retain proportional representation for a quarter of the seats in the chamber. This means the principles of electoral reform for both houses of parliament will be broadly similar. On April 18 a referendum on reforming elections to the senate introduced majority voting for 70 per cent of the seats and reserved 30 per cent for the traditional system of proportional representation. Although both houses of parliament will have to approve each other's reforms, it now seems likely that new electoral laws will be in place before the summer recess. But while the parties have begun to show a sense of urgency on this score, they have yet to tackle the far more complex task of redrawing constituency boundaries. Some politicians forecast this will take up to four months. The most contentious point so far had been whether to introduce a single round of voting as in the British system or a second round run-off like the French. In the event, a surprisingly wide majority opted for the single round. Those backing the latter were the four partners behind the Ciampi government  -Christian Democrats, Socialists, Social Democrats and Liberals - plus the populist Lombard League, the neo-fascist MSI, Mr Marco Panella's radicals and the breakaway communists, Reconstructed Communism. Some Socialists voted against the proposal but the main opponents of the single round were the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS), the Republicans, Greens and Mr Mario Segni's referendum movement. The latter appeared to miscalculate badly the strength of the single-round lobby. The powerful line-up against the PDS position was partly tactical. The parties feared the PDS would be able to rally considerable support on a second round. But equally the vote represented a widespread view that second round voting would permit an inconsistent patchwork of local alliances which would undermine the stability of a parliamentary coalition.</p>

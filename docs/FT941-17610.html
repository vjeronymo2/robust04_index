			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Markets: Wishing for even more happy returns - London Ring out the old, ring in the new. But before considering future prospects, investors and fund managers are entitled to indulge in some instant nostalgia for the year that has just passed. A period which started amid general foreboding about Britain's rude exit from the European exchange rate mechanism, and the continuing grip of recession on the UK economy, turned into a vintage year for both the equity and bond markets. During the year, pension funds enjoyed a 28 per cent return from UK equities, including dividends, according to the WM Company which monitors investment performance. Middle-sized and smaller companies significantly outperformed the FTSE-100, with returns of more than 35 per cent. Bonds provided returns in excess of 23 per cent on the back of falling bond yields and stable inflationary conditions - the best return from UK bonds for a decade. Although the level of mergers and acquisitions continued to fall, merchant bankers were able to keep busy with corporate restructuring, rights issues and flotations, which reached a five-year high. The strength of the market allowed analysts and traders to enjoy large Christmas bonuses and saw a resumption of the jobs merry-go-round in the City, after a long period of retrenchment. However, the unlucky few who came in to staff trading desks in the dog days between Christmas and the new year holidays had anything but a quiet life. Arriving on Wednesday morning, they found overseas markets had raced ahead during the Christmas break, and during the day the FTSE-100 gained 49.7 to hit a new peak of 3,462. The fact that nearly all of the advance had been shed by the time dealing closed at lunchtime yesterday was more to do with technical factors than any underlying change in market sentiment during the week. It emerged that many fund managers had been content with the gains they achieved during the market's autumn surge, and sought to lock these in by using the increasingly popular derivatives market. However, few had foreseen that the FTSE-100 would gain another 9 per cent in December, following the City's relief over the November 30 Budget. Some big institutions therefore had to scramble to buy shares to cover positions they had taken in the futures market. Once those contracts had been unwound, the pressure on prices quickly abated and the FTSE-100 yesterday closed at 3418.4, up a mere 6.1 on the week. What might have seemed an unusual week in trading terms, demonstrated the importance of two factors which have dominated UK equities in recent months: the relative performance of overseas markets and investment decisions by the big funds. There are of course more fundamental reasons for the increase in the UK market: falling interest rates and lower returns on competing investments, combined with evidence that the domestic recovery is at last gathering strength. However, much of the market's recent strength has come from overseas investors seeking a good return - particularly US investment funds, which have seen Wall Street perform only modestly in spite of the continuing recovery. The chart shows that London has lagged behind the other European markets - not to mention Hong Kong - even though the UK is expected in 1994 to be the strongest growing major European economy for the second successive year. This vote of confidence from overseas sits uneasily besides widespread concern in London that the UK market's current rating is counting on a recovery in earnings that companies will find difficult to deliver, given the fragility of consumer confidence, continuing insecurity over employment, and the tax burden which will be imposed on the economy when the Budget increases take effect in April. Equity strategists at UBS believe that the UK might be about to enjoy a 'golden scenario' - favourable growth and low inflation, crowned by a substantive fall in the budget deficit, combined with firm sterling and lower interest rates. However, they caution: 'The gold turns to dross in later years of this parliament, a reverse alchemy brought about by the Britain's deeper structural problems. Although Mr Clarke's Budget clearly recognised some of the dangers, the chancellor's modest measures will not in our judgment prevent a medium-term resurgence of inflation.' Nikko, the Japanese securities house, also sees some scope for further advance by the UK market in the new year, in response to further falls in interest rates. But it cautions: 'As reality dawns, with the bottoming out of interest rates, lower consumer confidence and a slowdown in the recovery, the market is expected to stagnate.' Year-end forecasts range from an unchanged 3,400 up to 4,000, but many market watchers believe there could be a substantial fall in share prices if and when the present cycle of low interest rates turns - as it could soon in the US. In this rather twitchy environment, investors are likely to seek out sectors and companies which have so far missed out on the market's advance. Motors may benefit from the combination of lower interest rates and increased growth. As the reality of the slow economic recovery sinks in, investors might also look to sectors which offer more defensive qualities. Nikko also highlights the food retailers, which have underperfomed massively and have a captive market, and domestic brewers and health and household companies, which it believes offers above-market earnings performance after a period of huge underperformance.</p>

			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: Fleming recruits equity strategy team from rival Stockbroker Robert Fleming and Co has recruited a highly successful equity strategy team from competitors Credit Lyonnais Laing, which is threatening legal action if the team develops a competing product for Fleming. Mr Michael Cardinene, chief executive at Credit Lyonnais Laing, said his firm had bought a company from the three team members and signed a three-year service contract with them in January 1992. 'The critical point of the purchase and sale agreement is that they are banned from developing the product for anyone else,' he said. 'If they violate the terms of the purchase and sale agreement, then we will bring legal action.' Exactly what the team can do for a new employer 'will be a matter for the lawyers'. Late yesterday, Robert Fleming declined to comment on what the team's duties were expected to be. The prospect of a row between the firms illustrates the fiercely competitive environment for UK stockbroking firms. According to the 1994 version of the Greenwich Survey, Credit Lyonnais Laing is ranked in the top 10 stockbroking firms in terms of market penetration, with 3 per cent of the 135 respondents listing it as their firm of first choice. Fleming is not rated among the top 10 in that category. The team, Mr Richard Clark, Ms Helen Bond and Mr Chris Chaitow, had developed a 'Momentum and Value' product based on a historical data base of stock and econometric information. Mr Cardinene said the product had been a key factor in Credit Lyonnais Laing's ability to gain market share. He said Credit Lyonnais Laing owns the data bases and retains additional members of the team, so it can continue to offer the product to clients.</p>

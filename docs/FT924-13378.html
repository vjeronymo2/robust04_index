			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Fall in value of sterling hits Heron rescue plan THE FALL in the value of sterling has created a problem for bankers working on the rescue of Heron, Mr Gerald Ronson's property group. The group's 11 bonds are all denominated in foreign currencies, more than half by value in Swiss francs. When talks started with the banks early this year the bonds' principal value was around Pounds 450m but that has risen to nearly Pounds 600m because of the pound's decline. The group's bank loans were about Pounds 800m, although some of these are also in foreign currencies. Although property values have also weakened since the spring, the feeling is still that banks will do better from a refinancing and orderly disposal of assets than from receivership. The 11,000 bondholders are anxious not to give ground to the banks in the restructuring, expected to involve a debt-for-equity swap. One banker involved in the talks said yesterday that the effect of the lower pound on the bond's value in sterling is an issue being discussed. The company and the steering committee of banks, headed by Barclays Bank, is meeting all the group's banks on October 20 and outline proposals will be presented.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Leonard Nikishin: "Who Can Cause an Earthquake"] </F>   [Text] A shocking report that the earthquakes in  Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Iran, and Armenia were the result of  nuclear tests conducted in the Soviet Union as part of a program  for the development of a so-called seismic weapon--for the  deliberate shifting of tectonic plates--appeared in the French  newspaper FRANCE SOIR with references to the opinions of  prominent Russian seismologist Aleksey Nikolayev, former RF  presidential adviser Aleksey Yablokov, and former intelligence  officer Oleg Kalugin.    Our correspondent asked Deputy Director Aleksey Nikolayev of  the Earth Physics Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences  for his comments. Here is what the scientist said:    "It is true that I discussed these matters with the Moscow  correspondent of the SUNDAY TIMES some time ago. He was  interested in my articles about the effects of nuclear  explosions on earthquakes and the development of seismic  processes. I was virtually the only person researching this  connection. I told the correspondent that one thing was  absolutely clear: It would be virtually impossible to develop a  seismic weapon. I also said that nuclear explosions do have some  effect, however slight, on earthquakes--not in the sense that  they cause them, because this is a result of massive natural  processes, but in the sense that they can hasten the onset of a  burgeoning quake. My findings were based on the use of extremely  sensitive equipment, which was capable of measuring even the  slightest influences. I denied that the earthquakes in Armenia  and Georgia were the result of nuclear explosions in  Semipalatinsk and on Novaya Zemlya."    "I do not know what the SUNDAY TIMES reporter had to say  about this meeting, but I have the FRANCE SOIR item, which was  clearly based on the British article, here on my desk. It says  that Aleksey Nikolayev believes that the earthquakes in  Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Iran, and Armenia are the after-effects  of nuclear tests. This is the exact opposite of what I said. It  says Yablokov `suspects' that a seismic weapon is being  developed in our country and that Oleg Kalugin, `chief of Soviet  counterintelligence,' frankly admitted his awareness of  scientific projects related to this weapon. `That is utter  nonsense,' Kalugin said when one of our staffers asked him about  this."    "This `wild goose' in the newspaper is far from harmless.  Articles of this kind arouse doubts about our country and  encourage people in the West to make decisions with negative  implications for us. And the West is not the only problem...."    "You may recall that after the earthquake in Georgia, then  Georgian leader Zviyad Gamsakhurdia declared that it was caused  by the Russian tectonic weapon. This is how the anti-Russian  hysteria started."    "I hope the article in your newspaper will put an end to all  of this speculation," Aleksey Nikolayev said at the end of our  conversation.</p>

			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: How loan pricing is set Sir, I could not disagree more strongly with Dominique de la Barre d'Erquelinnes' letter (October 5) which propounds one of the central errors committed by many lending banks. Even a cursory reading of the comments on the syndicated loans market in Monday's FT gives a clear picture of how loan pricing is actually being set at present. The banking industry has been characterised by extreme overcapacity for much of the past two decades. As in any other industry, this inevitably pushes down prices, and many decisions to lend at low rates have been rationalised by an over-optimistic view of the general provisioning costs which must be covered by the loan margin. Since actual loan losses are highly sensitive to the economic cycle, inadequate pricing is often masked in the early years of development of loan portfolios until heavier, specific provisions are required. Once the pricing inadequacy is exposed, many banks exit one lending sector and enter a new one, only to repeat the same mistake in a different setting - creating a 'cascade' of problem loans. A more rational decision would have been, as Ms de la Barre suggests, to refuse to lend, but this would have involved many lending officers and their line managers putting themselves out of work. Annual provisioning charges linked to the riskiness of the underlying transactions will not solve the problem of overcapacity. However, they will force bank managements to confront the explicit cost of pursuing a given lending strategy and make it clear that much lending business is loss-making over the course of the economic cycle.

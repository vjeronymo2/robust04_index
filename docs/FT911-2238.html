			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / International Company News: Suez fall beats forecast COMPAGNIE de Suez, the French investment and banking conglomerate, has announced final net attributable profits of FFr3.71bn (Dollars 620m) for last year, slightly higher than its earlier estimates, writes George Graham in Paris. Suez said yesterday that the result represented a 9 per cent fall from 1989's FFr4.06bn, but only a 4 per cent decline if the FFr189m one-off negative effect of a change in accounting policy on swaps and deferred taxation were stripped out. The company said it planned to convert all its outstanding preferred non-voting stock, with a proposed dividend of FFr8.08, into ordinary shares, whose proposed dividend is FFr7.80, on the basis of 21 preferred for 20 ordinary. This operation, with the absorption of the last 10 per cent stake in Societe Generale de Belgique that Suez has agreed to acquire from Cerus, the holding company of Mr Carlo de Benedetti, and the incorporation of its investment vehicle Compagnie La Henin, will result in the creation of 9.1m new shares.</p>

			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO EARNINGS  </P> <P> HomeFed Corp. The San Diego-based parent of HomeFed Bank reported  fourth-quarter net income of $33.1 million, up from a profit of $32.2 million  for the same three months the previous year. For the fiscal year ended Dec. 31,  HomeFed's profit was $115.7 million, up from $111.3 million for fiscal 1988.  </P> <P> Gains from real estate operations were of significant help to both the fourth  quarter and fiscal 1989 results. For the quarter, real estate gains were $23.8  million, up from $14.4 million for the previous year. Fiscal year real estate  gains were $80.2 million, up from $44.1 million for 1988. The gains were needed  to offset substantial increases in loan-loss reserves. HomeFed's bad loan  reserves, which were announced previously, totaled $108 million at the end of  the recent quarter, up from $18 million after fourth quarter 1988. For all of  1989, loan-loss reserves totaled $147 million, up from $48 million in 1988. The  loan-loss reserves helped reduce HomeFed's nonperforming loans to 1.81% of its  $17.8 billion in total assets on Dec. 31, down from 2.85% of assets as of Sept.  30.  </P></p>

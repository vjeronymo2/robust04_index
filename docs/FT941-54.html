			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / International Company News: Eridania Beghin-Say improves 5% over year Eridania Beghin-Say, the Paris-based food group controlled by Ferruzzi Finanziaria, lifted net profits 5.2 per cent to FFr1.34bn (Dollars 235m) for 1993 from FFr1.27bn the previous year, on turnover which increased 2.4 per cent to FFr50.9bn. EBS said most of its divisions had produced increased operating profit which had risen by 11.7 per cent to FFr4bn. But some of this profit was absorbed by exceptional costs related to restructuring. Proceeds from the sale of its North American animal feed business had brought its net debt down from FFr14.1bn at the end of 1992 to FFr12.5bn at the end of last year.</p>

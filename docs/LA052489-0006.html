			<p><P> May 24, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THREADS OF A SETTLEMENT?  </P> <P> The Los Angeles school board and the teachers' union should stop calling each  other liars and start settling the strike. Bits and pieces of an agreement can  be discerned here and there in the public and private pronouncements of board  members, union leaders and teachers. It's time to pull them together into a  firm contract so that thousands of students can return to fully staffed  classrooms where they belong.  </P> <P> There is a hard and ugly edge to the strike now. Tempers flare on picket lines.  Friendships erode as some teachers work while others walk. Board members are  clearly at odds. Negotiators for both parties cannot agree on what's been  offered. Still, leaders on both sides have to focus on the emerging outline of  settlement.  </P> <P> There should be great appeal in the idea of a pay settlement of 24% over three  years, whether or not it has been formally proposed. Teachers would get a raise  of almost one-fourth their current inadequate salaries. The district would get  the three-year contract it wants, so that it does not have to go through this  again soon. It's enough of a win-win situation that each side should be  content.  </P> <P> The question of reimbursing teachers for pay docked when they withheld services  earlier in the school year could be settled by splitting the amount down the  middle. The teachers felt they should be paid for extra duties. The district  felt it should not give teachers full pay if they did not perform duties they  have traditionally performed, such as turning in students' grades. Both were at  least half right.  </P> <P> Then there are the questions of preparation periods for elementary school  teachers and representation on management councils at each school. Certainly  elementary school teachers should have 40 minutes a day at school to work on  materials for their students. Why can't the cost of this provision be made  contingent on getting extra state money, which now appears available to the  schools? As for management groups, as long as state law makes the school board  responsible for the schools, the district is entitled at least to equal  representation on these councils.  </P> <P> The school board does not need to have all its members present at negotiations,  as United Teachers-Los Angeles President Wayne Johnson suggests, in order to  reach this kind of agreement. That should not be a condition of settlement. If  the teams in place can reach this kind of agreement -- and we think they can if  they want to -- perhaps this strike will finally be over and students can get  back to work.  </P></p>

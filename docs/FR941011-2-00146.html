One area of the ARAC deals with airport certification issues. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Task <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Specifically, the working group's tasks are the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Review Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 14, Chapter I, Part 139 and supporting material, previous studies and surveys, procedures and interpretations for the purpose of determining if it would be appropriate to undertake rulemaking and/or develop policy relative to performing friction measurement to be used in the maintenance of air carrier runway surfaces; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Review CFR Title 14, Chapter I, Part 139 and Advisory Circular 150/5340&hyph;18C, ``Standards for Airport Sign Systems,'' and supporting material for the purpose of developing a notice of proposed rulemaking which would require these distance remaining signs at some or all the airports certificated under part 139. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If deemed appropriate, draft for ARAC notices of proposed rulemaking for each task proposing new or revised requirements, supporting economic analyses and other required analyses, advisory and guidance material, and any other collateral documents the working group determines to be needed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Reports <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A.

Give a detailed conceptual presentation on the proposed recommendation to the ARAC before proceeding any further with the tasks. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C. Give a status report on the tasks at each meeting of the ARAC held to consider airport certification issues. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Friction Measurement and Signing Working Group will be comprised of experts from those organizations having an interest in the task assigned. A working group member need not necessarily be a representative of one of the member organizations of ARAC. An individual who has expertise in the subject matter and wishes to become a member of the working group should write the person listed under the caption  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  expressing that desire, describing his or her interest in the task, and the expertise he or she would bring to the working group. The request will be reviewed with the Assistant Chair of the ARAC for airport certification issues and the Chair of the Friction Measurement and Signing Working Group, and the individual will be advised whether or not the request can be accommodated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary of Transportation has determined that the formation and use of the ARAC are necessary in the public interest in connection with the performance of duties imposed on the FAA by law. Meetings of the ARAC to consider airport certification issues will be open to the public except as authorized by section 10(d) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act. Meetings of the Friction Measurement and Signing Working Group will not be open to the public, except to the extent that individuals with an interest and expertise are selected to participate. No public announcement of working group meetings will be made. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued in Washington, DC, on October 4, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Robert E.

			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Inflation pressures 'will stay subdued' Inflationary pressures in the economy are likely to remain subdued over the next six months, the latest survey of business in the east Midlands has found. The survey, published today by Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm, and Nottingham Business School, covers 973 companies. It shows that nearly half expect their prices to remain unchanged for the next six months while only 23 per cent predict they will raise prices by more than 2.5 per cent. This follows a year in which 66 per cent of companies held or decreased their prices and 52 per cent of wage settlements were below 2.5 per cent. Profitability has increased since September and order books are fatter, but recovery has not been as quick as companies expected. A total of 64 per cent of companies now expect the Budget tax increases to slow recovery further. This figure rises to 80 per cent in the food, drink and retail sectors. The survey says, however: 'The tax increases are only seen as slowing down the recovery and not heralding a return to recession.' Considerable slack remains. The level of capacity utilisation among manufacturing companies has scarcely changed since the autumn. Just 20 per cent of companies are working at higher than 90 per cent capacity. There is enough confidence in the region for 33 per cent of companies to be predicting an increase in recruitment over the next six months compared with 28 per cent in September. The levels of confidence are uneven: rising in the construction industry but falling in the textiles and clothing sector and with doubts about future prospects in the services and retail areas. There are also geographical disparities. Confidence is highest in Northamptonshire but lower than six months ago in Derbyshire, Leicestershire and Lincolnshire. East Midlands Business Survey.

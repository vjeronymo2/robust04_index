			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Survey of China (15): Natural magnet for Taiwan - John Elliott visits Xiamen, a buoyant city with its face to the sea THE old foreign trade and fishing port of Amoy in the south eastern province of Fujian could develop during the next decade into one of China's most important coastal industrial cities. Now called Xiamen, it is a special economic zone and has become a focal point for investment from Taiwan, 156 nautical miles away across the South China Sea. More than 400 Taiwanese companies have received approval during the past three years to set up light industrial labour intensive factories involving investment of more than Dollars 1bn. Goods ranging from Prince and Slazenger tennis racquets and Phillips coffee pots to folding umbrellas, electronic gadgets and textiles are being turned out in about 100 factories which have started production. Fujian and Taiwan have had close links for centuries. More than 70 per cent of Taiwan's total 20m population originate from southern Fujian and the dialects are similar. So the area is a natural choice for Taiwan's businessmen who want to tap China's cheap labour and land, thus escaping from Taiwan's escalating costs and restrictive environmental controls. But the investment take-up has been slow, partly because Taiwan only allows its businessmen to deal indirectly with China. This adds to costs because it involves transporting goods through Hong Kong and channelling money through New York and other financial centres. The local economic growth rate has been between 16 and 17 per cent annually for the past two years, according to officials, with industry growing by 20 per cent - despite China's economic and political problems. Targets for the next five years have been set at the same levels. This reflects the sudden entry of the Taiwanese, but the breakthrough that Xiamen is waiting for is an investment decision from Taiwan on a Dollars 7bn petrochemical plant which would dramatically change the city's fortunes. It would provide a primary industrial base and would make Taiwanese involvement take off with extensive down-stream industries. The decision rests with the Taiwan government and with the industrialist involved, Mr Wang Yung-ching, head of Formosa Plastics which is one of Taiwan's largest companies. Mr Wang, whose family comes from the area, is in negotiations with Peking and Taipei and has also talked about developing ventures in banking, shipping and transport. Taiwan, which regards itself as the rightful government of all China, is softening its policies but seems unlikely to permit full and direct investment, transport and communications for a year or so. It wants to use Mr Wang's and other possible investments as a lever to persuade China to provide some sort of overall investment protection agreement and to reduce problems of bureaucratic corruption and scarcity of raw materials. Meanwhile, Mr Wang is in negotiations on the extent and ownership of the petrochemical plant, and Xiamen's government has started preparatory ground works on the site, financed according to some reports by Mr Wang. The centre of Xiamen, which consists of a series of islands adjacent to the mainland with a population of 1.12m, was made a special economic zone in 1980. But it failed to develop significantly until Taiwan started to allow the indirect industrial investment in 1987-88. According to local government figures, a total of 980 projects, initially mostly from Hong Kong and Macao, have been approved since 1980 for projects costing Dollars 2.92bn. They include Dollars 2.12bn foreign investment, and Taiwan accounts for 410 projects worth Dollars 1.07bn. But only Dollars 500m foreign investment has actually gone ahead and this includes Dollars 200m on a single project - a Taiwanese chemical fibre plant. An unusually high proportion of the projects are wholly foreign owned - 309 out of the 410 - indicating that the Taiwanese want to control the businesses and do not want to delay investments while joint ventures are negotiated. Most of the production is for export, supplementing the factory owners' operations in Taiwan which often continue producing high-quality ranges. Factory managers say that labour costs are 75 to 90 per cent lower than in Taiwan but that there is only an overall production cost saving of around 10 per cent after transport, lower levels of productivity, and other problems are taken into account. Keen Find Sporting Goods, for example, employs 400 people to turn out 2,000 tennis racquets a day using frames imported from Taiwan via Hong Kong - international trade rules ban the import of the raw material into China. Mr Golden Ehang, th general manager, says wages are 12 per cent of Taiwan's, but he makes only 8 per cent on overall costs. 'I have come here only because the costings will improve when Taiwan's rules are eased - it's not worth it otherwise.' One of Xiamen's strengths is that there are 350,000 overseas Chinese for whom the city is an ancestral home. They include members of such famous families as Mr Lee Quan Yew of Singapore and Mrs Cory Acquino of the Philippines. It has ambitions as a tourist destination, primarily based on the attractions of a small island adjacent to the city centre called Gulang yu which is full of colonial villas built for foreign consulates and companies 100 years ago. To help attract investment, urgently needed infrastructure projects are now being planned. They include a Yuan 1.5bn 600 megawatt power station which is to be partly funded by Hong Kong Macao International Investment, a part-China owned Hong Kong company. Other projects include: a Yuan 340m water supply plant, supported with loans from Japan that will cover 35 per cent of the cost; a Yuan 350m harbour development financed domestically; a Yuan 320m airport extension which is now seeking fresh finance after losing loans of at least Yuan 100m from Kuwait; and a Yuan 350m telecommunications expansion which has yet to be financed. The real breakthrough, however, will only come when, eventually, Taiwan permits direct investment, air flights and other links with China. In the meantime, Taiwan adopts a confrontational diplomatic offensive against China. The real breakthrough will come only when Taiwan permits direct investment, flights and other links</p>

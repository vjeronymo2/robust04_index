			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sian Clare and Chris Moncrieff, PRESS ASSOCIATION News] </F>   [Text] German Chancellor Helmut Kohl today pledged to join  Britain in commemorating the 50th anniversary of the end of  World War II next year. But he said he had never sought to  attend the D-Day commemorations this year and would have  declined any invitation to do so. Mr. Kohl was speaking at the  end of a day-long summit with the Prime Minister at Chequers and  in London. Other British ministers met their German  counterparts at the same time.    Mr. Major told a news conference at the Foreign Office that  "the Anglo-German relationship is in very good heart indeed."    Mr. Kohl agreed: "The relationship is an excellent one and  has been for a long time. I don't think we should make any  bones about that. But in every family there are obviously  disagreements. As to the events that happened 50 years ago,  quite frankly I really do not understand what people are talking  about. At no point did I seek to get invited to the  commemorations for D-Day. Had I been invited I would not have  attended. This was very well known and it has not been an issue  between us."    Chancellor Kohl spoke of his wish to join with Britain in  commemorating the end of the war. He said it would be both  countries' duty to "remember the dead and pay our respects to  the victims." He said both nations felt obliged to see to it  that no generation would ever be in such a situation again in  Europe.    The Prime Minister said that during the talks the two  leaders  spent some time discussing the Bosnian situation. "There is no  doubt that after the setback earlier this month, the UN has  taken a step forward today with the withdrawal of Serb heavy  weapons from the surrounds of Gorazde."    Mr. Major said this had been due to the "skilful and  courageous work" of UN forces on the ground. "We are both  determined to help NATO and the UN deter aggression against any  of the safe areas. But the real prize is a negotiated  settlement."    Turning to the South African elections, Mr. Major said:  "Both  Britain and Germany have worked for many years, very often very  closely together, to help bring about change in South Africa.  We both wish to do all we can to assist the incoming government  after the elections are concluded. We hope to see business  investing there develop and harness the economic potential we  both believe exists in South Africa."    The Prime Minister said that both he and Mr. Kohl wished to  bring the young people of Britain and Germany closer together  and to improve mutual understanding of each other's country.  "The Chancellor and I agreed we would ask our officials to come  up with specific and imaginative proposals on this."    Mr. Major said both he and the Chancellor wished to see "a  substantial reduction in the regulatory burden on business"  because this would help economic growth and competitiveness.  "You are going to hear a good deal more about deregulation in  Europe," Mr. Major added.</p>

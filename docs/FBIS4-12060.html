			<p>BFN     [Text] In its session today, the cabinet decided not to  discuss the evacuation of Jews from Hebron, and the ministers  said that at this stage, the focus should be on promoting the  negotiations on Gaza and Jericho. The cabinet heard optimistic  briefings about the chances of concluding the negotiations with  the Palestinians by the end of April. The prime minister  expressed his fear that countries that pledged to contribute  funds to the Palestinians might not transfer their donations in  an orderly fashion, and that the delays might harm the residents  of the territories and make the political process more difficult.    Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports that the  cabinet was briefed about the difficulties in the economic  negotiations, due to disagreements among the Palestinians. The  cabinet was further told that U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher will apparently arrive in the region toward the end  of the month, before the resumption of the Washington  negotiations. In his coming tour, he will also focus on  promoting the negotiations with Syria.</p>

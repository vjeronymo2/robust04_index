			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Ukrainian rivals dispute lead as early results indicate close race Early results from yesterday's Ukrainian presidential election indicated a close race, with both candidates claiming to be in the lead. The incumbent, President Leonid Kravchuk, was polling strongly in nationalist western regions, while Mr Leonid Kuchma, a former prime minister, was well ahead in the Russian-speaking east. An adviser to Mr Kravchuk claimed early today that the president had won with a five-point margin over his adversary. But Mr Kuchma's campaign team claimed partial returns suggested their candidate held an eight-point lead. The outcome was not expected to be clear until late today. Just over 69 per cent of registered voters went to the polls in the run-off election between the two men - about the same as in the first round of voting last month and far in excess of the 50 per cent turnout needed for the election to be valid. Voting was particularly heavy in the fiercely nationalist western Ukraine, while turnout was lower in the Russian-leaning eastern regions. As in neighbouring Belarus, where presidential run-offs were also held yesterday, Ukraine's presidential debate centred on national independence and links with Russia, which still exerts a powerful influence over all the former Soviet republics. Mr Kravchuk has sought to shift the campaign away from his disastrous economic record and positioned himself as the sole guarantor of independence, while portraying Mr Kuchma as Russia's henchman because of his wish for closer ties with Moscow. Fighting for his job on nationalist issues could win Mr Kravchuk a second mandate, a remarkable achievement for a leader whose reign has been marked by deep industrial decline and hyperinflation. But his strategy has opened a Pandora's box of potential national discord between western and central Ukraine, which tend to back the president, and Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine, where Mr Kuchma's pro-Russian agenda is highly popular. Early results indicated that Mr Kravchuk was getting more than 90 per cent of votes in the Lvov and Ternopil districts, strong nationalist areas. In the east, Mr Kuchma was credited with more than 70 per cent in Kharkov and 80 per cent in the conservative Donbass coalfield. He had 82 per cent in the pro-Russian Crimean peninsula. In contrast with the presidential race, which has offered Ukrainians an often agonising choice between 'two evils', many of the mayoral and gubernatorial elections also held yesterday throughout the country promised real change. For example, Kiev's mayoral contest is pitting a democratic market reformer against a presidential appointee, albeit a progressive one.</p>

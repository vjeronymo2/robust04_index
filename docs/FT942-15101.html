			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Fashion: Big men mean big business - Large-as-life suit seekers Big men have enormous trouble buying off-the-peg clothes. And if they are both heavily-built and tall they may as well forget high street menswear stores and book a fitting at a tailor. That, at any rate, is the consensus among men who have endured the humiliating experience of shopping for big sizes only to come away empty-handed and feeling like circus freaks. Philip de Pass, a sugar broker at E D &amp; F Man, the UK sugar trading company, is 6ft 6in tall with a 38in waist and wears size 12 shoes. 'I have great difficulty buying clothes,' he says. 'My arms and legs are too long and almost all my suits and shirts have to be made-to-measure. Fashion and my shape do not go hand in hand. In shops, it is a case of buying almost anything that happens to fit.' Tall Lazards merchant banker Simon Pryce adds: 'The only retailer that specialises in extra long clothes is the High &amp; Mighty chain which I find too down market. All my suits have to be made-to-measure.' Some retailers and manufacturers are waking up to the fact that big men could mean big business. As healthy diet and regular exercise become more commonplace, people generally are growing taller and broader. A report last year by health secretary Virginia Bottomley shows that obesity is also increasing. It has risen among men from 7 per cent in 1986 to 13 per cent today. Historically, retailers' reluctance to cater for large men has been because suits sized at more than a 42in chest measurement often end up in the sales. Harrods, of Knightsbridge, had planned to open an area dedicated to big men but came to the conclusion there was too little demand. Its menswear buyer, Bill Christie, says: 'We stock from 36in short to 46in long but our best seller is a 40in regular.' He finds that German, Scandinavian and US brands are better for generously-proportioned figures. 'We sell Germany's Hugo Boss in a 46in long,' says Christie. 'The Swedish company Eton makes shirts with very long sleeves and the US's Calvin Klein makes jeans and underpants with a 40in waist. But if a big man wants a Giorgio Armani he has a problem'. Jeremy Hackett, managing director of men's outfitter Hackett, says: 'We make suits with a 46in chest and 40in waist but they are not commercial. The problem with large suits is maintaining the right proportions. However, our trousers are unfinished with 37in inside legs, allowing for individual adjustments. We also offer a bespoke service at our Sloane Street (central London) shop.' Rowland Gee, managing director of Moss Bros, which includes the Moss Bros, Savoy Taylors Guild, Cecil Gee and Suit Co chains, confirms that British men are getting bigger and he also observes geographical and socio-economic differences in sizes. 'In the early 1980s, we sold more 38in regular jackets than any other, but today 42in regular is the most common size,' he says. 'More men seem to be building up their torsos in the gym.' He adds that more expensive suits sell in larger sizes than cheap suits, attributing this to the affluent businessman's penchant for expense account luncheons. Gee also notes that men in the north of England tend to be bigger than men in the south and in Scotland. The Moss Bros group shops stock ranges from 36in short to 50in regular, with the Moss Bros hire department offering jackets to cater for a generous 60in. Gee's experience, like that of Bill Christie, of Harrods, is that German brands Hugo Boss and Odermark are ideal for large men, while the triangular cut of an Armani suit is less accommodating. 'German companies analyse big men,' he says. 'They make trousers with a higher rise to get over the belly. They anticipate that a man who buys a 44in long jacket is likely to be athletic and therefore provide trousers with a slim waist.' High &amp; Mighty, has introduced an increasing amount of fashionable, quality ranges in recent years. As a specialist in large-sized men's clothes, it has a thorough understanding of its customers' needs. Alongside its lower-priced own-label merchandise, it stocks Louis Feraud and Odermark suits, Eton and Stephen Brothers shirts, Easy Jeans and shoes by US company Rockport. Chest and waist sizes go up to 60in and footwear up to size 16. Traditionally known as a store for portly men, High &amp; Mighty is aiming to attract more tall men. It has signed up long-legged athlete Linford Christie to project this message in its promotion campaigns. Judith Levy, retail director, says: 'High &amp; Mighty designs clothes to flatter big and tall men and our sales staff are trained to put customers at their ease. A lot of big men have a poor self-image and do not like to look at themselves in the mirror. 'Some of our customers have to keep three separate wardrobes as their weight fluctuates. They may lose a few stone at a health farm and then six weeks later they are big again.' Whatever one's shape, off-the-peg clothes rarely compare with bespoke clothes. As a 6in 4in tailor, Ozwald Boateng attracts a lot of equally tall men to his office in Notting Hill, London. 'Everyone's shape is unique,' he says. 'It is difficult to find a suit that fits the chest and waist without having it made. I have a small waist but a long outside leg. If customers do not have an athletic physique, a bespoke suit can be cut to create the illusion of shapelessness.' Georgiana Grimston, who runs a bespoke business in Fulham, south west London, says that, while her suits flatter their wearer, she is brutally honest with customers during fitting sessions. 'Some men have the same chest measurement as their waist size,' she says, 'so we have to cut the cloth carefully to give a waist. Sometimes, we need to explain that stripes elongate a tall man and large checks fatten a big man. Their best bet is plain or herringbone cloth.' For large men who enjoy stylish clothes, but who would not feel comfortable squeezing into a pair of Versace jeans or a figure-hugging suit, there is solace from the men's catwalk shows this spring and summer. The designers message is that loose-fitting, oversized and unstructured clothes are de rigueur this season. Inno Aguib, menswear buyer at Browns, the designer store on London's South Molton Street, recommends large men look at Dolce e Gabbana's over-sized coat/jacket, which comes in beige and sand-creased linen, and Dries van Noten's baggy pyjama-style trousers in beige linen. But remember, light colours, like checks and television appearances, make people look bigger. Richard Rawlinson is news editor of Fashion Weekly.</p>

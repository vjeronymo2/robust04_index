Simultaneously with the filing of the complaint, OFCCP filed a Request for Admissions. The complaint and request for admissions were sent via Federal Express, which effected delivery on August 2, 1994. The complaint alleges that State, a construction contractor maintaining its principal place of business in Kenosha, Wisconsin, at all times pertinent hereto has held a Federal or Federally-assisted construction contract of $10,000 or more, within the meaning of the Executive Order, and has been subject to the contractual obligations imposed on Government contractors and subcontractors by the said Executive Order and the implementing regulations issued thereunder. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Following a compliance review of State, commenced by OFCCP on February 18, 1992, OFCCP, on February 27, 1992, issued to State a Notice of Violation, finding that State had violated its affirmative obligations in thirteen specific respects and was not in compliance with Executive Order 11246. As a result of said violations, the parties entered into a Conciliation Agreement on March 10, 1992 in which State agreed to provide OFCCP with personnel activity reports at six-month intervals, said reports to include information for the relevant six-month period on the number of vacancies for each craft, the number of contacts State has with linkage and recruitment resources to fill those vacancies, the number of applications received by State from each of its recruitment sources, the number of hires, and the total number of applicants and hires by race, sex and ethnicity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The first personnel activity summary report was due to be filed with OFCCP on August 1, 1992, to cover the period from January 1, through June 30, 1992, but was filed, untimely, on August 26, 1992. State was notified of deficiencies in the report in an October 16, 1992 letter to which it responded on November 11, 1992, indicating it had hired 14 trade employees during the reporting period, and that the 14 hires included two women and one Hispanic. State did not notify the Milwaukee Urban League, Big Step, Inc., Spanish Center of Racine &amp; Kenosha, the Urban League of Racine &amp; Kenosha, Inc., Women's Resource Center and Cartage College of these 14 openings and did not request that these sources supply applicants for any of these positions, in violation of an agreed-to term of the Conciliation Agreement. Also, computer and other records produced by State in response to the October 16, 1992 letter failed to support State's supplemental report that it had 14 trade hires, including two women one Hispanic. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On December 11, 1992, OFCCP notified State, by letter, that the November 11, 1992 response was unacceptable and requested further clarification and information. OFCCP agreed to State's request that State be permitted to file the clarifying information with its second activity report which was due February 1, 1993, but that report was never filed. This failure to file the second personnel activity report, the incompleteness of the first personnel activity report, the failure to notify of openings and its failure to recruit and employ minorities and women during the period from January 1 through June 30, 1992, all in violation of the Conciliation Agreement were appointed out to State on February 19, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On July 29, 1993, OFCCP notified State of its determination that the company had violated its obligations under the Conciliation Agreement and gave State 15 days in which to respond. No response has been received. As of the present date, State has failed to file an answer to the complaint or admissions as requested. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On August 29, 1994, OFCCP filed a Motion for a Default Judgment and Entry of Sanctions. The Plaintiff cites the regulations at 41 CFR 60&hyph;30.32(c), governing Executive Order 11246, stating that if a defendant fails to request a hearing within 20 days of the filing of the complaint such failure shall constitute waiver of hearing and all material allegations of fact shall be deemed to be admitted. Furthermore, if a party fails to respond within 25 days to request for admissions, the matters of fact stated in the request shall be deemed admitted. 41 CFR 60&hyph;30.9(b) Plaintiff cites  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> OFCCP <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Milwaukee Fence, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  91&hyph;OFC&hyph;3, slip. op. at 3, wherein the Secretary affirmed the administrative law judge's entry of an order imposing sanctions in a situation similar in all respects to that in the instant case. Furthermore, sanctions are appropriate where, as here, a contractor has failed to abide by the terms of a conciliation agreement and is in violation of the Executive Order. Accordingly, I recommend that the Secretary enter a Final Order providing for the following relief: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

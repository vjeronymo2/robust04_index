			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Survey of Saudi Arabia (10): Subsidies scythed - Farming and self-sufficiency Appropriately enough, one of the biggest pruning efforts so far undertaken by the Saudi Arabian government in its preliminary attempts to trim the towering budget deficit is in agriculture. The scythe has been taken to wheat subsidies. Since the 1970s the government has guaranteed the kingdom's 28,000 grain farmers a premium purchase price to assure security of wheat supplies. This year, it amounted to between Dollars 400 and Dollars 530 a tonne. That is so far above world wheat prices that the kingdom has not only exceeded its domestic requirement of 1m-1.3m tonnes since 1984 but also become the world's sixth biggest wheat exporter. In the last two years, wheat production has hovered at record levels of around 4m tonnes. Since 1987, the number of wheat farms has shot up by 37 per cent, and deliveries to the Grain Silos and Flour Mills Organisation, the state purchasing body, have risen by more than half. Wheat subsidies, much the biggest part of an estimated Dollars 2.6bn spent in total agricultural subventions in 1992, passed the Dollars 2bn mark. But no more. Through a mix of policies which include trimming the outright subsidy in favour of other grains, particularly barley, and dissuading big producers from producing wheat, the agriculture ministry is bent on restoring balance to a sector which economists and outside observers had long singled out as wasteful, both of government funds and precious fossil water. Some critics reckon that since agriculture accounts for around 90 per cent of the kingdom's 14bn cubic metres of annual water consumption, and wheat the bulk of that, the kingdom perhaps exports as much as 80 per cent of its yearly water output, embedded in wheat, every year. Foreign experts have estimated that at present rates of depletion, Saudi Arabia has only 15-20 more years of water to tap, though officials refuse to comment on such figures. Instead, they point to countrywide dam-building projects designed to help replenish aquifers by holding what annual rainfall there is, and by emphasising that the thirsty wheat harvest is being controlled. By setting a purchase quota and buying first from smaller producers, staggering subsidy payments to bigger farmers and forcing the latter to build their own grain storage silos - the state's own, holding 2.38m tonnes, are full - the government hopes that the next harvest will fall to 2.5-3m tonnes and slide further thereafter. 'Even if we had a healthy budget position, we would have to think about these subsidies,' says a senior agriculture ministry official. 'If we'd left it to the farmers, output would double every year.' Instead, grain farmers are being encouraged to produce barley, some 3.5m tonnes of which are imported a year as fodder. Barley subsidies are half those granted to wheat, while higher domestic production will help the kingdom's other runaway deficit, on the trade account. The ministry believes the kingdom will reach self-sufficiency in barley within two years. Saudi Arabia is already self-sufficient, or almost, in fish, most seasonal vegetables, fruits, eggs, poultry and dates - of which the kingdom is among the world's biggest producers. Nearly 600,000 tonnes of dates are produced a year, and all but a fraction, which is donated to fellow Islamic states as charity, is consumed domestically. Both production and demand are rising at around 10 per cent annually. The search for self-sufficiency was prompted by fears in the 1970s that the west might impose a food embargo in retaliation for the kingdom's use of the oil weapon after the 1973 Arab-Israeli war. According to the agriculture ministry, between 1987 and 1991 food imports halved in volume to just over 4m tonnes, while the value of local food production rose to 60 per cent of total consumption from 53 per cent. Locally-produced foodstuffs rose from 51 per cent to 74 per cent of the volume of food consumed. The value of food exports rose to SR19bn in 1991 from SR13bn in 1987. Yet the sector as a whole accounted for 9-10 per cent of gross domestic product, at constant prices, throughout the period. The agriculture ministry is now making efforts to increase production of red meat, particularly lamb, by encouraging joint stock agriculture companies and other farmers in the relatively rainy northern areas to farm sheep. Even so, it will be hard to make much of a dint in gross imports - for the Eid al-Fitr feast after Ramadan alone, the kingdom imports 2m live sheep, mostly from New Zealand. Nevertheless, the ministry says local production is now keeping pace with an annual rise of 4-5 per cent in demand. A few companies are beginning to make use of wool and sheepskin, byproducts of the country's lamb consumption which were largely ignored in the past. But self-sufficiency is only one aim of the kingdom's continuing undertaking to subsidise agricultural production. The government has always emphasised the importance of the subsidies as a means by which the kingdom's oil wealth can be shared with the rural hinterland, at the same time dissuading people from leaving the countryside for Saudi Arabia's main cities. 'If we'd not done this, Riyadh would be another Cairo,' says a ministry official, 'and we'd be spending billions instead on infrastructure and roads. This way we help limit city growth, slums and crime while at the same time keeping people living on our borders.' Success in this regard is difficult to quantify, though government figures show a fall in the proportion of people working in agriculture from 14 per cent of the workforce in 1985 to just under 10 per cent today. Perhaps as strong a political motive for the subsidies is the fact that the farmers' lobby includes several land and farm-owning princes - a reason why cuts in overall subsidies to the sector are likely to be undertaken with some delicacy.</p>

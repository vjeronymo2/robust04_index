Siting Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following discussion presents the EPA's rationale for proposing the requirement for sources to prepare a siting analysis, including the various siting approaches considered and the proposed siting analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Siting Analysis Approaches Considered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The EPA considered four approaches in the development of proposed siting analysis requirements. These approaches are summarized below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The first approach would require that an environmental assessment be conducted, patterned on requirements under the National Environmental Policy Act. This would require an examination of impacts in all media (i.e., air, water, solid waste, energy, and land use). It would also require a description of alternatives to the proposed project including alternative sites, technologies, or design. The elements of this approach would cover a range of health and environmental impacts that can be considered in siting an MWC. However, many of these elements are addressed in current Federal, State, or local permitting processes or review procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second approach is patterned after the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). Requirements for siting hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities. It consists of an exclusion list with the provision that an MWC cannot be sited in certain locations (e.g., in a 100-year floodplain or over a high-quality groundwater resource) unless ``it can be shown to the satisfaction of EPA'' that no adverse impact will occur.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The third approach would be a regulatory review approach. Under this approach, the MWC owner or operator would prepare a document listing all current Federal, State, and local regulatory requirements and permit conditions that apply to the proposed MWC, along with a discussion of the equipment, construction practices, operating practices, and other conditions used to comply with each requirement. This approach addresses relevant siting issues, and would not require duplicate analyses of health or environmental impacts that are already required under other authorities (e.g., New Source Review (NSR) air permits, National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) water discharge permits, stormwater permits, wetland permits, State solid waste permits, or local zoning permits).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The fourth approach would establish general siting requirements patterned after requirements currently in use under the NSR program. This approach would require an analysis of the impact of the facility, taking into account other major industrial facilities near the proposal site, on ambient air quality, visibility, soils, and vegetation. This approach has already been successfully implemented under the NSR program. Under this approach, facilities may be able to use analyses conducted under the NSR program to comply with the NSPS siting requirements. This approach would also involve public meetings, and the facility owner or operator would be required to prepare summaries and comments to the public comments received at the public meetings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Proposed Siting Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The EPA is proposing the fourth approach, as discussed above, as the basis for the proposed siting analysis. The first three approaches were considered to either overlap with current requirements or be overly complex. Under the proposal, MWC owners or operators would be required to conduct an analysis of the impact of the proposed facility on ambient air quality, visibility, soils, and vegetation. Furthermore, this analysis would be required to consider the air quality, visibility, soils, and vegetation impacts of other major industrial facilities located near the planned MWC. Consideration of the impacts of other local facilities would involve an analysis of both background air quality levels and emissions from other sources in the area prior to operation of the planned MWC and total air emissions in the area after addition of the planned MWC due to the incremental impact of the planned MWC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA believes that requiring this type of siting analysis would allow facilities to use the same type of siting analysis for complying with both NSR and NSPS requirements. The Agency invites comments regarding the proposed siting analysis, including suggestions of alternative approaches.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

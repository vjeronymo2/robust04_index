			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Technology: Revved up for a simple shift in gear - John Griffiths reports on the race to perfect a new transmission system that will revolutionise vehicle manufacture Rivalry is developing between two groups, Dutch and British, over innovations that could make conventional gearboxes redundant. Continuously variable transmission (CVT) systems are claimed to be more efficient and easier to use than the usual manual or automatic gearboxes. The claim is made by Van Doorne's Transmissie of the Netherlands and the British Technology Group, whose transmission systems have been developed separately and work on different principles. Although sales of the CVT systems that have appeared on the market and which have been confined to small cars are relatively disappointing, the rivals' activities are assuming significance for the world's car makers for two reasons. First, Van Doorne, whose CVT technology is the only one used in cars on public sale, appears to have overcome engineering and other hurdles which have so far confined its system's commercial application to low-powered small cars. It has undergone trials successfully in Chrysler's Voyager multipurpose vehicle and a prototype has survived the 700-plus horsepower punishment provided by a Williams-Renault racing car in a three-year development programme. Second, BTG has signed Ford as the first licensee for its Torotrak subsidiary's 'infinitely variable' transmission. Ford is considering Torotrak for fitting to the successor to its Mondeo/Contour medium-sized 'world' car at the end of the decade. BTG says several other licensing agreements are about to be signed after more than three decades of development work on the transmission. It maintains the Torotrak IVT will cost no more to produce than a conventional four-speed automatic, while offering significant performance, flexibility and fuel economy advantages. According to BTG's development engineers, it has shown fuel consumption savings of at least 15 per cent compared with a manual gearbox and a reduction in exhaust emissions of around 30 per cent. Unlike all other forms of transmission, including Van Doorne's, it requires no clutch to begin moving and it is claimed to be simpler and cheaper to produce than other systems. Torotrak could be BTG's biggest commercial coup. Production could run to millions of units a year if the IVT provides a more efficient and adaptable transmission for vehicles from mechanical diggers to buses and racing cars. The IVT has been under development, under various owners, since 1960. It is the variator mechanism, a few inches square, that lies at the heart of the Torotrak system and which, BTG insists, makes it a viable proposition for almost any type of vehicle. BTG believes that this holds the key to resolving the awkward compromise represented by current engine/gearbox systems. An engine needs to rev fairly fast to produce its available power and has relatively low torque, or pulling power, at tickover. A clutch and a range of gears are, therefore, required to allow the car to pull away from standstill and move progressively to highway speeds. During much of this sequence, the engine is operating outside the fairly narrow range at which it is most power- and fuel-efficient. A conventional automatic gearbox replaces the manual clutch with a hydraulic torque converter. This has a similar function to the clutch but saps considerable amounts of energy, increasing fuel consumption. It, too, usually has only four gears so it also only rarely allows the engine to operate at maximum efficiency. The pursuit of greater flexibility is encouraging some transmission makers to build in five speeds, but this increases cost and complexity. The current small crop of CVTs in everyday use, all using Van Doorne's technology, is manufactured by Ford for itself and Fiat; Volvo (also used by Rover), Subaru and Nissan are also using it. They allow the engine to operate at its optimum speed for fuel economy or power, depending on how the accelerator is used. However, they are relatively costly. Torotrak offers the same ability to select the correct drive ratio for any combination of speed and load. But it requires no clutch and has no similar mechanisms to the expandable pulley system that makes the Van Doorne concept work. The variator contains two power input discs which are driven, via a torsional damper, by the engine. Between them are two inner discs from which power is transmitted. Crucial to the concept is that the working face of each disc is curved. Between each set of inner and outer discs are three rollers. The angle of these rollers equates to the input/output ratio. Because the rollers can take up any angle within the spacial limits of each cavity, these ratios are effectively infinite. Forces are transmitted between the discs and the rollers by a traction fluid, which under increasing loads becomes semi-solid and thus capable of transferring power through a shearing action. The system requires only a simple forward/reverse lever and if fitted to a powerful car could provide a motorway cruising ratio of up to 60 miles per hour per 1,000 rpm. An electronic engine management system translates driver commands conveyed through the accelerator pedal into optimum engine performance, for maximum acceleration or cruising economy. However, because it is the powertrain's torque that is being directly controlled, not gear ratios, all kinds of characteristics can be built in through the controlling computer. It would be easy, for example, to program six or seven distinct ratios for drivers who wanted the feel of a sports car, says Maurice Martin, one of the BTG executives in charge of Torotrak. The Torotrak system is not confined to vehicles and could be used to optimise the rotation of electricity-generating windmills. Several other big advantages are claimed: the transmission has far fewer parts than a conventional system and requires no complex machining and no high-performance materials. Also, the traction fluid separates working surfaces so the transmission should last longer than a conventional unit. BTG has invested Pounds 6m in the system since 1988. It has been working with Ford for several years, beginning with a prototype transmission in an Orion saloon. Ten Mondeos are to be fitted with the transmissions by early next year and will be evaluated by high-mileage users such as the police. Ford remains cautious about whether it might eventually take out a full-scale manufacturing licence. 'This represents one of the many efforts within Ford to study technologies that could improve customer satisfaction while being environmentally friendly,' says Adam Mirren, Ford's powertrain research manager. Van Doorne has no doubt its initiative is a front runner. Its newly-developed, 'second generation' lightweight steel compression belts used to drive the expandable pulleys of its system provide the basis for transmissions usable 'across a manufacturer's complete range', it says.</p>

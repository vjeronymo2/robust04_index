			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Palestinian president Yasir </F> 'Arafat by Sawsan Abu-Husayn in Cairo "yesterday"]    [Text] [Abu-Husayn] Dr. Usamah al-Baz, director of the  Egyptian president's office for political affairs, said that you  and Rabin will sign an agreement before 13 October [as  published]. Does that mean that there are U.S. assurances that  such a step will be completed on this date?    ['Arafat] Dr. al-Baz made that statement before the recent  hectic and unbalanced maneuvers. While the economic talks  between us and them were continuing in Paris, they decided to  suspend the talks in Cairo on the pretext of celebrations in  Israel. This raises the question that there are two governments  in Israel: one sanctioning negotiation and another suspending  it. It is one of the continued Israeli maneuvers designed to  obstruct the main aspect of the negotiations, that is the  withdrawal. It has become known that Israel is procrastinating  to obstruct the peace agreement. Regrettably, there are -- for  the first time in Israeli history -- tendencies inside the  Israeli Army controlling the Israeli Government's policy. Rabin  is a prisoner of these tendencies inside the Army.    [Abu-Husayn] But a month ago Israel was urging a speedy  resumption of the negotiations to implement the agreement, so  what is the secret behind this contradiction?    ['Arafat] There are secret organizations inside the Israeli  Army, like the French organizations that confronted the brothers  in Algeria after they had signed the first and second Evian  agreements. It is the same thing. There are secret  organizations inside the Israeli Army seeking to obstruct the  implementation of the agreement.    [Abu-Husayn] Obstructing the implementation of the agreement  would lead to further violence and counterviolence. In your  view, what is the solution?    ['Arafat] That is true. I hold Rabin responsible,  especially as any obstruction of the agreement's implementation  will have serious adverse effects on the overall situation  inside our occupied land, because there is a serious Israeli  escalation against the Palestinians, especially from Army units,  extremist elements, armed settlers, and secret organizations.  There are four secret organizations in the Army: "Sha'ol's  Sword," "David's Sling," "Revenge," and "Custodians of the  Temple."    This is known to the cosponsors of the peace process, the  United States and Russia, who have been informed of details of  the actions carried out by the secret organizations operating  inside the Israeli Army.    [Abu-Husayn] Hamas and Islamic Jihad today urged  preparedness for war. What is your opinion?    ['Arafat] That is part of escalating the incident and a  reaction to the escalation of Israeli violence.    [Abu-Husayn] After the PLO's regret for the Israelis'  murder, the United States is demanding that you take a stronger  position. What is your position?    ['Arafat] We should not forget that victims of the bus  incident include some Palestinians, as it was a public bus used  by the Palestinians of 1948.    [Abu-Husayn] Do you invite Rabin to come to Cairo tomorrow  to sign the agreement?    ['Arafat] I agreed with the brothers in Egypt to return to  Cairo on 12 April so that after this date the implementation of  the withdrawal operations would begin and Israeli Army troops  would be replaced by Palestinian security forces in both the  Gaza and Jericho strips. So I am not going to invite Rabin. It  is the cosponsors' responsibility to maintain the thrust of the  peace process and force the Israelis to implement what was  agreed. It is also the international community's responsibility.    [Abu-Husayn] So do you expect the signing to take place  this month, at the end of it, as Israeli Foreign Minister  Shim'on Peres said?    ['Arafat] I am not in a position to offer expectations. But  let Rabin and the Israeli Government understand that obstruction  is harming not only the Palestinians, but the Israelis as well.    [Abu-Husayn] Why do you not invite Rabin to sign?    ['Arafat] I am not inviting Rabin to sign, because yesterday  he refused to sign on 12 April -- which is a defiance of the  Israeli proposal. The U.S. Administration should contact Rabin,  especially as it proposed this date!    [Abu-Husayn] In view of the repeated talk about the U.S.  secretary of state's participation in the agreement signing,  does that mean that a breakthrough concerning the date will  emerge within days?    ['Arafat] I do not think so.    [Abu-Husayn] When will you go to Jericho?    ['Arafat] That matter is delayed for a while, because I am  dealing with the events, and Israel is maneuvering for the sake  of obstructing the agreement. This should be known to the  Palestinians, Arabs, and the whole world. Rabin is under  pressure from a force in Israel exercising obstruction. Rabin  is controlled by this situation, and he has to prove otherwise!    [Abu-Husayn] How do you view the importance of the Arab  position's support for the implementation of the agreement?    ['Arafat] The importance of peace in confronting the  warmongers for the sake of posperity has been proved today.  There have been incidents which stress the importance of  bolstering peace and assuming this responsibility fully. The  current situation is much more serious than it appears on the  surface, and I always warn of it.    [Abu-Husayn] What would you tell those opposed to the  Gaza-Jericho agreement, especially in view of the hitch in the  negotiations?    ['Arafat] The severity of the opposition gives you the  answer...tell me who your enemies are, and I will tell you who  you are! ('Arafat did not elaborate)    [Abu-Husayn] What are the results of your visit to Cairo?    ['Arafat] President Mubarak and Egyptian officials have made  huge efforts, but regrettably, Israel is not listening to any  appeals and has abandoned all the promises it made. While the  Cairo negotiations have been suspended, the economic  negotiations are continuing in Paris.    [Abu-Husayn] When will the negotiations resume?    ['Arafat] There is talk that they should be resumed Sunday  (tomorrow) [10 April]. We see Israeli attempts to avoid  implementing the agreement and get around it with a view to  abolishing or obstructing it.</p>

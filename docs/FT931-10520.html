			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Survey of Iran (15): Problems for liberal hosts - Refugees Afghan refugees have not exactly been queueing up to leave Iran despite political improvements at home. Even rather obvious hints from Iranian officials that the time has come to leave have fallen on deaf ears. Last month Esmail Mufidi, Governor of Khorasan Province, which borders Afghanistan, assured the 2.9m refugees that their return was essential to the success of the Islamic Revolution in Afghanistan. The truth is that it would not exactly damage the revolution on the Iranian side of the border, either. Iran's problems stem from its liberal treatment of those who take refuge within its borders. There are no camps, just a handful of 'guest cities' where refugees are invited, but not forced, to live. The 4m displaced people in Iran are free to live and work anywhere except in regions suffering from war damage and therefore unable to support an extra burden. However, they still represent a considerable burden to their hosts. Afghans make up the majority of the refugees. The 1.3m Iraqi Kurds and Shia Moslems that poured across the border in the wake of the Gulf war have mostly returned, but there is still a large Kurdish community who fled Iraq during more than 20 years of repression. The Islamic Republic has played host to numerous waves of displaced people since the 1979 revolution. About 400,000 Iraqis were exiled to Iran exile in the early days of the Iran-Iraq war and a further 100,000 followed after the attacks on the Kurdish villages. More than 10,000 Kuwaitis also fled to Iran after Saddam's invasion. There are also relatively small numbers of people fleeing events in Sudan, Sri Lanka, Egypt, Palestine and India. 'Nowhere else are refugees given such freedom. We wish more countries would take the Iranian example and give an alternative to camps,' enthused an American aid worker in Tehran for a conference on the refugee problem. Last month, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) gave new assurances that some 2m Afghans, now in Iran and Pakistan, would return home this year. However, Tehran is becoming increasingly depressed about the level of displaced peoples happy to shelter under the Iranian flag. According to Mr Jean-Marie Fakhouri, UNHCR deputy for South Asia and North Africa, about 1.3m Afghans returned to their homeland in 1992. But only an estimated 300,000 were from Iran. However, Mr Ahmad Hosseini, director-general of the Bureau for Aliens and Foreign Immigrants' Affairs, says the Dollars 15m earmarked for Iran by the UNHCR in 1992 fell drastically short of the expenditure on refugees. And he said Iran had not received the Dollars 130 each Afghan refugee had been promised by the UN to help them return. Iran's greatest fear is that as the turmoil in the countries surrounding it increases, it will be seen as a safe haven for all the displaced people of the region. Mr Hosseini argues that although 90 per cent of the Iraqi Kurds that took refuge in Iran in the aftermath of the Gulf war have gone home, the situation is still a cause for worry. Saddam Hussein is still in charge in Iraq and his aggression against minority Kurds and Shia Moslems could still send a new wave of refugees into Iran. To the north, the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia has produced its own displaced population. Takijistan is also in turmoil and the two peoples share a common language and culture, making Iran the natural port of refuge. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan sent 2.9m Afghans into Iran, but Tehran has received less than any other host nation in international funding - mainly given by the US and Japan - the bulk having gone to Pakistan. Mr Hosseini says: 'The entire world should help us, we are taking care of them (the refugees) on your behalf. If the developed world does not help today, tomorrow the refugees will not be only in Iran and Pakistan, they will gather on the borders of Europe.' According to a report by the US Committee for Refugees to a US Senate sub-committee on Refugee Affairs in 1991, 'For every dollar reportedly allocated per Iraqi refugee in Iran, Dollars 7.60 has been spent for an Iraqi refugee on the Turkish-Iraq border.' There are 80 'guest cities', but less than 7 per cent of Afghans in Iran live in these. The rest live in 24 provinces throughout Iran. But 55 per cent have chosen to settle in Khorasan, Kerman, Sistan and Baluchestan. In Khorasan they make up 23 per cent of the population. In some areas, especially on the borders, the ratio of Iranians to refugees is one to one. More than 33,000 have taken Iranian wives and become part of local families. Most of these people have no one left in Afghanistan to return to. Iran allows refugees to work in 16 occupations, but construction is the most popular. There is no limit to the amount of money that they can send home. With Afghanistan's future still uncertain, and the construction industry still healthy in Iran, there are few incentives to return east. Some 61 per cent of the Afghans were farmers, but in Iran a mere 8 per cent still work on the land. They have created many problems for the host nation. Some 80 per cent of the refugees are aged less than 40 and the competition for jobs is beginning to cause tension. Since the fall of Kabul to the Mujahideen, some 176,000 Afghans have returned home. According to Iranian officials, those who went home from Iran have found that their countrymen who took shelter in Pakistan received Dollars 130 to return, as well as blankets and food. Iran has not had the funding from the UNHCR to allow her to do this. As the news filters back, it becomes more attractive for the refugees to stay put. The conclusions of the USCR report on the Iraqi crisis holds just as true for others taking refuge in Iran: 'Iraqi refugees in Iran should not be punished because they have fled to a nation isolated from the western world. The aid is for the refugees, not for Iran.'</p>

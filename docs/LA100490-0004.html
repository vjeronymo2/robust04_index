			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. ARMS SALES TO SAUDI ARABIA  </P> <P> The Times (Sept. 21) reported that a Saudi representative said that if the  United States balks at carrying through on a $20-billion arms deal with the  Saudis, the sale will go to another country. Doubtless, the defense contractors  are absolutely ecstatic about closing this deal, especially so since they'd  also be called upon to supply the Israelis with arms.  </P> <P> The Saudis, according to Fred Dutton, the Saudi's Washington representative,  want the arms to contend with a continuing Iraqi threat. However, isn't it a  bit premature to be selling them all these arms to forestall a long-range Iraqi  threat when the current situation hasn't been resolved?  </P> <P> If world, or even Mideast peace, is truly a mutual goal for the United States  and our allies in this crisis and if there is a chance of establishing a new  world order, then why not seek a mutual agreement to simply not sell arms in  this region, and hopefully nowhere else in the world. We and our allies can  pressure Brazil, China and others to do likewise. Let's at least try. Surely by  now it's becoming obvious that the arms being sold may well be used against the  sellers in wars or by terrorists.  </P> <P> Let's sincerely make world peace our primary objective. We owe it to all the  dead and maimed GIs of our previous wars who thought they were fighting to make  the world safe for democracy.  </P> <P> PHILLIP CUTLER  </P> <P> Costa Mesa  </P></p>

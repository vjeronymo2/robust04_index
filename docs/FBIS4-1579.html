			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Debbie Kuo] </F>   [Text] Taipei, March 31 (CNA) -- The next round of talks  between Taiwan and Mainland China is expected to be held in  Taipei in late April, chief Taiwan negotiator Hsu Hui-yu said  Thursday [31 March] in Beijing.    Hsu, the deputy secretary-general of the Straits Exchange  Foundation (SEF) and leader of the Taiwan delegation that left  for Beijing last week for the fourth round of talks with  mainland negotiators on cross-strait technical issues, boarded  the plane for Taiwan Thursday empty-handed.    The talks centered on three non-political technical issues  --  the repatriation of mainland hijackers, the repatriation of  illegal mainland immigrants, and the resolution of cross-strait  fishing disputes.    Although the Taiwan negotiators made the biggest concessions  possible, Hsu said, the talks once again failed because of  Beijing's continued reluctance to recognize Taiwan's  jurisdiction rights.    SEF Vice Chairman Chiao Jen-ho, while regretting that no  agreements were reached during the talks, called for  higher-level dialogue in the future.    He said negotiations would not be effective simply because  of  the use of "eloquent" or "effective" negotiators, but require  sincerity and consensus from both sides.</p>

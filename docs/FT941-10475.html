			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / UK Company News: P&amp;O to spend Dollars 680m on new liners Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation, the shipping, transport and property group, announced that Princess Cruises, its US-based subsidiary, had placed orders for two new superliners from Italy's Fincantieri shipbuilding yard. The ships, with passenger capacities of 1,950 and 2,500 will cost Dollars 295m (Pounds 197m) and Dollars 385m respectively, and will be delivered in 1997. The first is a sister ship to the company's 77,000-ton Sun Princess, due to be delivered by Fincantieri in January 1996. The other is dedicated to the Caribbean market. The two ships are being financed with loans at 8 per cent over 8 1/2 years. P&amp;O, through Princess Cruises, is one of the three leading companies in the world cruise market. At present it operates nine ships in North America, the largest market, carrying 430,000 passengers annually. It commands a 40 per cent share of the Alaskan cruise business but lies behind its two rivals, Carnival and RCCL in the Caribbean. Lord Sterling, P&amp;O executive chairman, said the North American market had grown by about 10 per cent a year for the past 10 years. Recent research, however, suggested that only 5 per cent of the total available cruise customers took cruises. The strengthening economic recovery in the US was expected to increase demand for both Caribbean and Alaskan cruises. Bookings since the start of the year had risen and passenger yields had improved. In addition to the US market, P&amp;O operates two general cruise ships in Europe and one in Australia. Next year, a third ship will begin service in Europe. Lord Sterling said that the P&amp;O cruise division was 'one of the fastest growing and most consistent profit earners and cash generators in the P&amp;O group'. It does not publish separate figures for the cruise division, but according to Mr Richard Sanderson, of brokers Panmure Gordon, the passenger shipping division is likely to see pre-tax profits rise to about Pounds 150m for the year to December 31, of which half will derive from passenger cruises.</p>

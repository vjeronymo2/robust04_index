			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Opposition reconfirms"] </F>   [Text] (Maputo) The 10 unarmed opposition parties met in  the Mozambican capital last night to decide on reconfirming  Inacio Bento as candidate to the post of Elections  Administration Technical Secretariat, STAE, assistant director.  Bento was reconfirmed with five votes in favor, one abstention,  and four votes against.    The "yes" vote is due to the fact that it has been  established that he has returned his Mozambique Liberation Front  [Frelimo] Party membership card. It is worth noting, however,  that Engineer Inacio Bento only gave up his Frelimo Party  membership card on 11 January, the day after he had been  selected by the opposition. MEDIAFAX learned this yesterday from  Hermenegildo Infante, head of the Frelimo Party Central  Committee Mobilization and Propaganda Department. According to  that source, Inacio Bento delivered his membership severance  letter by hand to an official of the Registry Department, in the  Frelimo Central Committee headquaters, at 1030 on 11 January.  In his letter, Bento alleged that he had never done any  specific work within the Frelimo Party and he added that he had  been neither a relevant nor an effective member, but the head of  the mobilization and propaganda department said that Inacio's  allegations are false because he had done work of some  responsibility in the Frelimo Party cell at the National  Hycarbon Company, ENH. Hermenegildo Infante further noted that  Bento should have surrendered his severance letter at the party  cell committee at ENH and that he had been "dishonest" when he  claimed to have done so "a long time ago." Bento's letter  carries the date of 20 December, but was only received at the  Frelimo Central Committee Registry Department on 11 January.    Our source in the Frelimo Party said that his party's  statutes grant members the right to renounce their membership.  According to Infante, not many do so, but "there are some who  desert" the party. He added that in Niassa Province, for  instance, there were some "desertions" in mid-1993.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The leadership of the NPFL [National Patriotic Front  of Liberia] has expressed satisfaction over the recent visit by  two separate delegations from the LNTG [Liberian National  Transitional Government] to Gbarnga.    Speaking at a press briefing at the Executive Mansion in  Gbarnga, former NPRA [National Patriotic Reconstruction  Assembly] government president, Charles Gankay Taylor, said he  believed the recent visit of the State Council and TLA members  to Gbarnga were in line with the search for lasting peace. Mr.  Taylor also congratulated the acting chairman of the State  Council, Councilor Philip Banks; State Council first vice  chairman, (Isaac Missiles); and TLA [Transitional Legislative  Assembly] Speaker Morris Dukuly for braving the storm to come to  Gbarnga, despite all the lies and deception.</p>

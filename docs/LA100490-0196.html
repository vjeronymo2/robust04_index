			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SPOTLIGHT;  </P> <P> CRAIG HARTLEY OCCIDENTAL  </P> <P> Football Running back  </P> <P> Senior 6-foot, 185 pounds  </P> <P> Craig Hartley, who hopes to become a podiatrist some day, used some fancy  footwork to gain 228 yards in his debut at tailback Saturday for Occidental  College.  </P> <P> A converted defensive back, Hartley carried 39 times, although he barely made  it to the field.  </P> <P> "I started off breathing so hard, I couldn't catch my breath because I was so  excited," Hartley said. "I was gasping because I had gotten myself so worked  up."  </P> <P> The reaction was understandable. For three years Hartley has been a starter at  defensive back. But when Brian Madlangbayan -- who was filling in for starting  tailback Gary Little -- went out with a sprained neck, Hartley was called in  against La Verne, which Occidental defeated, 38-27.  </P> <P> Hartley, a history major who plans to follow his father into podiatry, got word  he would be starting at tailback only three days before the game. He had been a  part-time running back at McCullough High in Woodlands, Tex., located an hour  north of Houston in the heart of oil country.  </P> <P> In Woodlands, Occidental is the name of a petroleum company, not a college.  Whatever, Hartley proved to be a slippery fellow against La Verne.  </P></p>

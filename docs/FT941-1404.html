			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Contractors' penalty warning The parliamentary ombudsman has warned contractors providing government services to the public that they must be prepared to offer cash compensation if they are found guilty of maladministration. Mr William Reid said in his annual report that he intended to treat contractors in the same way as civil servants in investigating complaints on the provision of public services. Compensation for maladministration can often be extended beyond the people who make the complaint, the ombudsman notes. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Foods paid out some Pounds 600,000 to hundreds of farmers after the ombudsman upheld complaints over the slaughter of poultry after the salmonella-in-eggs affair, and the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency made ex gratia payments to more than 200 lorry drivers wrongly deprived of licences. Contractors should keep adequate records to provide 'appropriate audit trails' in investigating complaints. The ombudsman said 1993 had been his busiest year for investigating complaints since 1981. He completed 208 investigations, up from 190 the year before. The number of complaints about maladministration by government departments referred to the ombudsman by MPs was 986, the highest since 1980. However, the increase over 1992 of 4.3 per cent represented an easing of the rate of increase which had reached 18 per cent in the previous year.

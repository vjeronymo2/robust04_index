			<p><P> December 19, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: CATLIN, MERTENS TO PLAY FOR SDSU  </P> <P> Scott Catlin, a defensive back from Southwestern Community College, has signed  a national letter of intent to play football at San Diego State next year, and  Aaron Mertens, an offensive lineman from Kearny High, has orally committed to  the Aztecs.  </P> <P> Catlin, 5-foot-10 and 175 pounds, was named first-team all-Southern Division in  the Mission Conference as both a defensive back and a kick returner. He had 12  pass breakups and two interceptions last fall. He returned those interceptions  a total of 150 yards -- one for a 100-yard touchdown and another for 50 yards.  He also averaged 24.4 yards per kick return and 18.2 per punt return.  </P> <P> "He's a great cover guy," Southwestern Coach Bill Kinney said. "In our scheme,  we use a lot of man-to-man coverage and combinations. When we used the combos,  we usually left him by himself (in the coverage) and he did a great job all  year long.  </P> <P> "He's a good tackler and a very aggressive defensive player."  </P> <P> Kinney said Texas El Paso, San Jose State and Fresno State also recruited  Catlin, who will enroll in SDSU in time for spring football. Catlin is a  graduate of Sweetwater High School.  </P> <P> SDSU has now signed two community college players for next season -- Catlin and  Alex Semenik, a tight end from Scottsdale (Ariz.) Community College. Those are  the two positions SDSU Coach Al Luginbill said at the end of the season that he  wanted to fill with community college players.  </P> <P> Mertens, a 6-6, 230-pound center, was named to the Los Angeles Times'  all-county second team.  </P> <P> "His work ethic is the No. 1 thing that stands out about him," Kearny Coach  Willie Matson said. "He's the hardest-working kid we've ever had at Kearny."  </P> <P> Although Mertens decided against officially visiting other schools, Matson said  Mertens was seriously recruited by Arizona State, Cal, Washington, Washington  State, Colorado, Colorado State, Oregon and Iowa.  </P> <P> Matson said Mertens plans to sign a letter of intent on Feb. 6, the first day  high school players are allowed to do so.

Ulucevik  arrived in the island today to be briefed by Turkish Cypriot  officials with regard to the latest phase of the talks  concerning the confidence-building measures package.    In a statement to a TAK [Turkish Cypriot News Agency]  correspondent at Ercan [Tymbou] State Airport, Ulucevik said  that, on the basis of the conviction that the package will  facilitate a comprehensive solution, Turkey and the Turkish  Republic of Northern Cyprus will not in principle change their  attitude unless the package is amended.    Ulucevik is accompanied by Ertugrul Apakan, Turkish Foreign  Ministry's deputy director for Greek and Cypriot affairs.  Ulucevik and Apakan will remain in north Cyprus for two days.</p>

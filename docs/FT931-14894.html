			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Neotronics ahead of forecasts NEOTRONICS Technology, a maker of specialist gas and water analysis equipment, raised pre-tax profits by 16 per cent, from Pounds 2.62m to Pounds 3.03m, in the year to September 30, writes Matthew Curtin. The outcome was ahead of market expectations and the shares rose 8p to 161p . Turnover jumped to Pounds 19.3m (Pounds 16.1m) with higher sales in the US, EC and Australia driven by legislation demanding tighter environmental and safety standards in industry. Operating profits were Pounds 3.12m (Pounds 2.65m). Mr Paul Gotley, chairman, said the results were underpinned by emphasis on research and development - spending on which increased from Pounds 1m to Pounds 1.37m. He said the greatest longer-term potential lay with Solomat Instrumentation, the group's water quality analysis subsidiary acquired in January last year. The re-organisation and integration of Solomat was complete, and although regulations controlling the water industry worldwide were still in their infancy, new legislation in the EC and US would spur demand for Solomat's products. Earnings per share improved to from 7.26p to 7.65p and the proposed final dividend is increased to 1.75p making a 2.6p (2.52p) total.</p>

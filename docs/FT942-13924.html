			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Babcock issue to raise Pounds 79m amid shake-up Babcock International, the engi-neering contractor and materials handling group, yesterday announced a four-for-seven rights issue to raise Pounds 78.6m and the restructuring of its heavily loss-making energy division. The shake-up will lead to 450 job cuts at Babcock's manufacturing plant at Renfrew, Scotland, and a Pounds 25m exceptional charge in the year ended March 31. The group estimated its pre-tax loss at Pounds 41.2m for 1993-94, against a profit of Pounds 21.1m a year earlier. It is passing its final dividend. Both the rights issue and the charges were larger than some analysts had expected, but Babcock shares rose from 33 1/4 p to 37p as the City reacted warmly to the long-awaited announcement of future strategy, following the arrival in October of a new management team. Mr John Parker, chief executive, said: 'We have put in place a plan to enable Babcock to be more competitive in the international marketplace. The overall objective is to establish sustainable profit and dividend growth.' Babcock has suffered a succession of troubles in its contracting businesses. The biggest was the discovery of serious technical problems on its Pounds 400m-plus flue gas desulphurisation contract at National Power's Drax power station in North Yorkshire. Now Mr Parker plans to move Babcock's energy division away from large construction activities to become more focused on technology, engineering and project management. 'We have a certain size, and we must not bet the balance sheet on a particular contract,' he said. The division, he said, would concentrate marketing towards higher growth markets, particularly China and the Pacific Rim. It has signed a partnership agreement with the Wuhan Boiler Works, China's fourth largest boilermaker. At the same time, Mr Parker will continue to expand Babcock's materials handling and process divisions. Babcock has also negotiated replacement banking facilities totalling Pounds 60m, extending over two years. These are conditional on the rights issue proceeding and without them, the group would have been in breach of its banking covenants on publication of the audited accounts for the year ended March 31. Lord King will retire as chairman in July. Mr Parker will succeed him and Mr Nick Salmon, managing director, will become chief executive. Background, Page 21</p>

			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / International Company News: Anglo American confirms opposition to unbundling ANGLO American Corporation, South Africa's largest company, has restated its opposition to the concept of unbundling as a means of reducing its size and influence in the local economy. In his annual statement, Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson, chairman, noted: 'The corporation has no intention of mounting a major unbundling exercise. We believe the corporation's overall structure is sound and continues to serve the interests of the shareholders and the country well.' Unbundling has been much in the news in South Africa recently following the May announcement by Gencor, South Africa's second largest mining house, that it planned to break itself up into smaller units, and last month's cautionary statement from Barlow Rand, the largest industrial group in the country, that it will split itself into three. Mr Ogilvie Thompson had two main messages to deliver. First, that Anglo was a dynamic company which benefited the economy. The second was a strongly argued case about the appropriate aims and limits of competition policy, unbundling and black empowerment - areas set for greater prominence under any new black dominated government. Anglo, and much of corporate South Africa, fears that the heavy-handed or confused application of these policies could cause considerable economic damage. Mr Ogilvie Thompson argued that the most important aspect of competition policy was to reintegrate the country into the global economy. He conceded that Anglo and its associates controlled about 25 per cent of the capitalisation of the Johannesburg stock market but he disputed that this conferred excessive power which could be used to thwart the state. He noted that Anglo accounted for about 6 per cent of the country's fixed capital stock. He argued that far from being an 'acquisitive, short-term orientated US-style' conglomerate, Anglo had been characterised by organic growth, which accounted for as much as 80 per cent of the capitalisation it controlled. Mr Ogilvie Thompson said South Africa would have to find the right balance between policies which sought to promote competition, and those which sought to promote industrial capability, which probably involved favouring large companies.</p>

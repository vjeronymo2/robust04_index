			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Enes Musevic] </F>   [Text] After 28 days and nights of the worst hell, the  citizens of Gorazde that have survived seem to have entered  better and quieter times. This is suggested by events since  early this morning. The chetnik snipers, anti-aircraft weapons,  and tanks have fallen silent. Under pressure from the  international community and with the arrival of the first  contingent of blue helmets, the murderers from the hills do not  seem to live here any more.    The first estimates suggest that the chetniks -- despite the  considerable delay considering the NATO deadline -- have started  to withdraw from the points from where they have been sowing  death in Gorazde. The chetniks are scorching the earth as they  pull back. The members of the Ukrainian battalion that arrived  in Gorazde on Saturday evening have started to impose a buffer  zone in the region. The result is obvious: There is no more  blood in the streets of Gorazde, there is no more death,  screams, and pain.    After more than a month a UNHCR convoy with food and  medicine  managed to enter Gorazde late last night. Another humanitarian  convoy has been announced for today for the starved and bleeding  Gorazde. Still, the main concern of the people is today's  resumption of the evacuation of the badly wounded from the  Gorazde hospital.</p>

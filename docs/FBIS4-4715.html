			<p>BFN     [Text] Mae Sot -- Ethnic Karen guerrillas will hold peace  talks today with Burmese junta representatives at a Burmese town  about 48 miles from Mae Sot in Thailand's border province of Tak.    The Karen National Union (KNU), the strongest ethnic group  which has been fighting the ruling Burmese for more than four  decades for greater autonomy, had earlier refused to enter  negotiations with Rangoon unless the venue was outside Burma.  It had also demanded that the talks be held in the presence of  UN representatives and the media.    Informed border sources said the talks will take place at  Myabadai village, which is located between Kyaido and Nabu  district, and that powerful junta leader Lt Gen Khin Nyunt will  also participate, in addition to senior local Burmese Army  commanders.    The Burmese junta or the State Law and Order Restoration  Council (Slorc) had earlier proposed Pa-an, the Karen capital,  as the negotiating site. But the proposal was turned down by  the Karen for security reasons, citing previous experience when  Karen negotiating delegates were hunted down by Burmese troops  after the failure of peace talks.    The sources said the Karen eventually agreed to meet inside  the country at Myabadai because the village used to be under the  control of the Karen and the KNU could easily provide security  for its delegation from bases along the border. However, both  sides agreed that they will not be accompanied by troops and  that all delegates will be unarmed. The Karen were not  available for comment as of the press time.    The sources said preparations have been going on for the  past  few days and that Burmese forces in Kawkareik, about 15 miles to  the north of Myabadai village, recently went to Myawadi, which  is opposite Mae Sot, to buy food and other provisions. Two GMC  trucks were filled with the purchases, they said.    The meeting, the first since a new group of military  officers  under the banner of Slorc seized power in September 1988, is a  preliminary forum aimed at building mutual confidence and paving  way for future ceasefire negotiations, according to the sources.</p>

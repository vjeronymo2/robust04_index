			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [News conference by Civic Alliance Party Leader Nicolae </F> Manolescu with unidentified correspondents; place and date not  given: "The Diversion Gambit of the `Future for Romania Group'"]    [Text] Starting with the conclusion of the group "For the  Future of Romania" [UVPR], brought together to discuss "Where  goes Romania?", Mr. Nicolae Manolescu stated at the PAC [Civic  Alliance Party] news conference held last week: ``In our  opinion, in no way are we faced with the problem of identifying  the lack of a dialogue between the government and the opposition  as the main cause of the current situation. Please note that  this view is synonymous with the one used by Mr. Iliescu many  times, and summarized in one word: consensus. Mr. Iliescu's  consensus dream has taken here a more explicit form of the one  between the government and the opposition. I do not want to  overstress the fact that, if this dialogue, one absolutely  normal in a democratic society, was not sufficiently clear and  supportable, then it was not in most cases because of the  opposition, but rather the government, which rejected all those  proposals and suggestions from the opposition that could have  gotten the discussions underway. The events are well-known.  Every time the opposition asked the government for certain  things that, in our opinion, were obligatory, the government  rejected them. Every time the government was brought into a  situation to implement the opposition's program, the government  turned it to its own benefit. The most glaring example is the  reorientation of the current government team in Romania from the  East to the West, and from the CIS towards Euro-Atlanticism.  This is a reorientation that can be very easily seen if I can  remind you that, beginning with the August 1991 putsch and  continuing, not directly in chronological order, with the treaty  between Mr. Iliescu and Mr. Gorbachev, for a long time in first  place in the negative reporting in many publications, the  Government of Romania started to look to the East and precisely  towards the CIS. The government took the country towards the  West at the point when, to our good fortune, Gorbachev and  Gorbachevism fell from favor in Russia, at the point when Russia  radicalized itself. And, in recent times we have witnessed a  sort of victory celebration on the part of the people who just  one or two years ago were speaking only about the treaty with  Gorbachev, but who are now speaking about the eventual  agreements with Bill Clinton and our entrance into Europe and  the Council of Europe. Just as, in the end, these gentlemen were  the ones who brought about this extraordinary reorientation of  our entire lives from the East to the West. Last night, they  signed the document to establish the Consultative Council for  Euro-Atlantic Integration, a document that has its roots in the  opposition. This document came out of the ranks of the  parliamentary opposition and is one that was finally accepted by  the government. The opposition also sent representatives to this  meeting, and Mr. Iliescu had an entourage there (don't blame me;  that's what Mr. Iliescu calls it), and the ministries and other  organs of the government were also represented there. Currently,  the opposition's arguments for the West and for European  integration can no longer be combated by the government. At this  time, the government can no longer bet on the CIS and Yeltsin  (if the government would do what Yeltsin is doing in Moscow, we  could also avoid some problems), and, so, it is betting on the  West and Euro-Atlanticism, and it wants to profit from this,  which is not correct. The wolf can change his clothing, but not  his habits. The government was represented by Mr. Gherman. More  importantly, the PSM [the Socialist Party of Labor] as well as  the PRM [the ROMANIA MARE Party] were there, but not represented  by their presidents. Furthermore, they tabled a declaration that  noted that they are signing the document, but have important  reservations concerning several of its provisions. I would have  admired the PDSR [the Romanian Social Democratic Party] if it  had taken a similar action. The PDSR, however, completely  changed its clothing. In this case, it bears no resemblance to  the wolf of old, and it signed the document, after which the  Romanian mass-media presented us with the interesting  observation that this Consultative Council was a consensual  effort. Returning to the analysis at the beginning here, I think  that the real motives for the current situation are of a factual  and governmental nature, not theoretical and oppositional or  dialogue focused. I say factual and governmental because the  government is the one that must implement the reform program  with everything that it involves. And the government, what does  it do? So you can understand, I will tell you what was proposed  to us today in the Senate as a radical measure to improve our  standard of living during the winter. In opening the meeting, I  made a statement where I protested the manner in which we are  treated in our homes, with no heating or hot water. I said that  I understand that the government did not deliver on its promises  that we would have heating oil and all the other things, because  this is not the first promise that this government has not kept.  But, what I do not understand is why we are paying for that  which the government has not provided. The result of this was  that one of our colleagues from the PDSR accused me of populism.  Today, in conclusion, the government, informed by my populism,  came forward with a radical measure: some allocations for the  disadvantaged categories of people in order to pay for the  recent increases in heating costs. I will ignore the amount of  the allocation, which is sufficient for you to eventually buy an  amount that would fill a lantern. I will also ignore the source  of this money, which will only be partially covered by the  budget, with the remainder coming from a tax that you will pay  when you leave the country to travel abroad. The paradox is that  those who leave and do not use heating pay more than those who  stay and use it. The solution would be for as many people as  possible to leave. If 40 percent of Romania's population were to  leave, the remaining 60 percent could get heating. Such a plan  is not far removed from what Ceausescu was also doing, giving us  a few lei compensation for one thing or another. The gentlemen  from "A Future for Romania" say that the political parties in  the opposition have not answered the question "where goes  Romania?" Yes, we have responded: towards capitalism. We were  timid at first to say that word, but we have taken the bull by  the horns and answered: back to capitalism!    ``I am very worried that the manner in which `A Future for  Romania' presents this problem sounds like a diversion: Let's  give a dose of the politicians to the people, the people who  cannot buy necessities and who are dying from the cold, and  let's explain to the people that, if bread now costs what it  does and if it is cold in your home like during the Ceausescu  era, this has nothing to do with the government, with Mr.  Vacaroiu, or with the stalled negotiations with the trade  unions, but rather it has a direct and personal link with the  politicians, especially those in the opposition. Right before  you is one of the people to blame for the situation in the  country.''    In conclusion, Mr. Nicolae Manolescu pointed out the members  of the leadership of the PAC, present at this conference, as the  "guilty ones," from the diversionist point of view of the  above-mentioned group. Since the speech was very comprehensive,  there were no further questions.</p>

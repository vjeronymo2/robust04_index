			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Survey of Madeira (9): The debate on tourist strategy - Should the island stay exclusive or aim for the charter market? Two or three thoughts may strike the first-time visitor to Madeira on the 30km taxi ride to the island capital, Funchal, from the airport near Santa Cruz. The highway is impressively modern - thanks to generous support funds from the European Union - as it weaves through mountains and valleys, a countryside not unlike parts of southern Italy, even down to the terraced mini-vineyards. And then there are the buildings, lots of new ones and more in the making, small hotels, large homes and the timeshare developments. An initial reflection: is planning getting out of control in Madeira, and is the traditional tranquillity of an island oasis favoured by the rich and famous (especially during the winter months) about to be ruined? On the flight back from Funchal to Lisbon on the Portuguese mainland, the thought persists, despite efforts by local officials who insist that planning is now well and truly under control. The emphasis on 'now' is important, for there is something like a consensus on the island, and particularly with most of the main players in the tourist industry, that things did get out of hand more than a little in recent years. There is just a suspicion that the long-established regional government had been rather flexible with the approval of planning permissions, sometimes it is claimed to local political and financial supporters. The argument about the best tourism strategy for the island tends to be drawn in extremes, although in truth it is relative. Should Madeira remain an expensive quality market with top-class hotels and supporting facilities for the relative few who can afford them, or should it shift a little or even more downmarket to attract greater tourist numbers to somewhat more modest surroundings? Should the aim be the individual traveller or the charter market, albeit not on a mass scale, since the island's size and infrastructure could not cope with, say, Spanish-type numbers? Group Pestana, Madeira's and Portugal's largest hotel chain, is inclined to go for greater numbers: the English Blandy family, with extensive hotel, transportation and wine interests, wants to remain upmarket. Mr Antonio J. da Trindade, himself an hotelier and head of the tourist section of the Madeiran chamber of commerce, is somewhere in-between in the debate, although he is currently developing a new upmarket hotel project with the Blandys and some other local interests. Mrs Conceicao Almeida Estudante, the recently appointed regional director of tourism, maintains a diplomatic silence on the debate, but she is aware of the issue. The argument might not be all that important if tourism was a fringe activity, but it very definitely is not. Tourism is responsible for some 20 per cent of Madeira's gross product and gives employment to around one in 10 of the total labour force, and very many more if you add in downstream support and supply services. The industry peaked in 1991 with almost 400,000 tourist arrivals, compared with only 120,000 some 20 years earlier, but it has come through hard times in the past two years with tourist numbers down almost 10 per cent last year as the European recession took hold. Visitors from Portugal apart, Britain has traditionally been the largest single market for Madeira, and while numbers were down last year, the UK still provided one in three of all tourists to the island. Other large national groupings were German, Swedish and French. Madeira's tourist industry remains centred in Funchal and its immediate surroundings, where the vast majority of the island's 16,000 hotel beds are situated. But as the island's road network is extended west of Funchal and eventually to the northern coastline, it is hoped to decentralise the industry and spread tourist benefits to the poorer and mainly unspoiled parts of the region, albeit (it is claimed) with a tighter planning regime. The most recent of three independent studies of the potential for tourist development, taking into account the size of the island, its population and the need for better balanced economic growth, has suggested an optimum number of 25,000 hotel beds with the emphasis on four-star rather than de luxe accommodation. Environmental considerations apart, there are certainly some limitations to immediate expansion. Larger aircraft and more direct scheduled flights to Funchal must await the further expansion of the runway at Santa Cruz and deregulation of the European airline industry to permit more carriers to land there. The indirect flights via Lisbon are both tedious and time-consuming, and TAP Air Portugal's present virtual monopoly on the Lisbon-Funchal route means that space is often hard to get. (The problem is aggravated for tourists by the fact that native Madeirans get concessionary rates on the Lisbon service, thus taking up a large slice of available tickets.) Again, while Madeira has a wonderful climate - the average summer weather reading of 22 degrees falls to only 16 during winter months - it has no real beaches, so the big hotels must provide swimming pools and this is inevitably reflected in accommodation costs. The island does have some stunning scenery, exotic gardens, a well-development internal transport system of buses and relatively inexpensive taxis and marvellous facilities for walking through the mountains and along the Levadas, Madeira's wonderfully constructed 800km of irrigation channels that take water from the mountain tops to the fields and villages below. But the visitor wanting to experience one of the cleanest environments in all Europe, and to play or simply laze on more than 7km of fine sandy beaches, should visit (by short air trip, or by boat) the small island of Porto Santo to the north of Madeira and part of the same autonomous region. There are few cars for hire, but lots of taxis for sight-seeing, including to the house where Christopher Columbus lived for a while after his marriage to Isobel Moniz, the daughter of the local governor. But be warned. Accommodation is very limited on Porto Santo so, as all the good guide books say, be sure to book in advance. Most of the smart people you will find there, especially during summer months, are the industrial and commercial elite from Funchal who know a good find, and who tend to keep quiet about it.</p>

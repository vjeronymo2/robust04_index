			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by E.F. Kaminskiy, K.A. Demidenko, A.M. Bezhanidze, </F> V.V. Barsukova, and N.M. Zhmykhova; UDC 553.982.2(470):665.6]    [Abstract] In the eighties, 30 to 35 new oil deposits were  developed each year. Only seven were developed in 1990, and at  present, more than 70 percent of proved oil reserves are now  being developed. In 1992, the Russian Federation recovered 385  million tonnes of oil and gas condensate, which accounted for  about 85 percent of all oil recovered in the CIS. Of all the oil  recovered in the Russian Federation, 67.0 came from Western  Siberia. An analysis of current and projected development of 11  oil deposits managed by the associations of the  Glavtyumenneftegaz revealed that by the year 2000, oil recovery  will increase at 6 of them. These six deposits are relatively  small, however, and the increased oil recovery from them will  not offset the decreases in oil recovery activity projected at  the deposits of the Nizhnevartovsk, Megion, and Langepis  associations. The association Nizhnevartovsk (the largest of the  11 associations) accounted for 19.8 percent of all oil recovered  in 1993 and is projected to remain the leader in oil recovery  through 1995 (accounting for 17.8 percent of the oil recovered.  By 2000, however, it is projected to drop to third place behind  the associations Yugansk and Surgut. The percentage of  ``rejuvenation'' of the oil recovered by the associations Pur,  Urengoy, Megion, and Krasnoleninsk has been calculated at about  40 percent, and a figure of 22 percent has been calculated for  the region as a whole. The All-Russian Scientific Research  Institute of Petroleum Refining has studied virtually all new  deposits in Western Siberia. The following have been deemed the  most interesting: Priobskaya (heavy with high sulfur and  paraffin contents and a 45 percent maximum yield of light  fractions, a valuable raw material for jet fuel, and interesting  as a source for high-viscosity base oils and vacuum distillate  for catalytic or hydrocracking; Kharampurskaya (heavy with a low  sulfur content, high paraffin content, and 64 percent maximum  yield of light fractions and promising as a source of gasoline  with an octane number of 59, jet fuel, winter diesel fuel, and  low-viscosity boiler fuel); Severno-Komsomolskaya (heavy with a  high sulfur content, virtually free of gasoline fractions, and a  source of components of jet and diesel fuels and low pour-point  oils not requiring dewaxing); and Sugmutskaya (a high-sulfur,  low-paraffin, high-potential oil that may with deep refining  yield virtually all types of low-sulfur fuels and good-quality  base oils). By the year 2000, the amount of high-sulfur oil  produced by the Glavtyumenneftegas will increase from 52.5 to  55.2 percent; however, the mean-weighted content of sulfur in  both high- and low-sulfur oils will decrease somewhat. The oil  recovery situation is not nearly as serious in other areas of  Russia as in Western Siberia. The most promising oils in the  European part of Russia are the following recently discovered  oils of the Timanovo-Pechorsk region and the shelves of the  Baltic, White, Barents, and Okhotsk seas: Kharyaginskaya (a  paraffin content of 21 percent, a possible source of jet fuel,  and potential 19.4 percent content of base oils with a viscosity  index of 98), Peschanoozerskaya (low-sulfur, 84 percent content  of light fractions to 350C, and source of TS-1 jet fuel and  summer and winter diesel fuels with a viscosity index of 99),  Kaliningradskaya, and Sakhalinskaya.

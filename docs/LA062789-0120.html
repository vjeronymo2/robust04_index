			<p><P> June 27, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SOUTH COUNTY;  </P> <P> CHAMBER OUTLINES PLAN FOR NEW BUSINESS CENTER  </P> <P> Plans for a center to help businesses are among the new fiscal year goals of  the South Orange County Chamber of Commerce.  </P> <P> Pat Crockett, president of the newly renamed chamber, which is based in Laguna  Hills, said Monday that the organization wants to establish a South Orange  County Center for Economic Development. "It would be something to help our  existing businesses expand and do the things they want to do, and also a center  to help new businesses that want to come into south Orange County," she said.  </P> <P> Crockett said other goals of the chamber will be to continue to seek federal  relief from some recent changes in the federal income tax law that have caused  problems and confusion for businesses.  </P> <P> The organization was formerly known as the Saddleback Regional Chamber of  Commerce, and its new name becomes effective Saturday, coinciding with the  beginning of a new fiscal year.  </P> <P> The chamber installed officers at its recent dinner-dance at the Irvine Hilton  and Towers. George Walsh of San Clemente is the chamber's new chairman of the  board, and Elaine Carter of Coto de Caza is chairwoman-elect.  </P></p>

Prior to 1917, the Kremlin served  as the Moscow residence of Russian emperors. In the famous St.  George Hall, the distinguished guest is to be greeted by  President Boris Yeltsin.    The palace's largest hall, it is the place for state  receptions and meetings dedicated to the Russian military order  of St. George the Victorious. The snow-white walled hall is  richly decorated with stucco moulding. The walls bear  bas-reliefs showing St. George hitting a dragon. Above the  cornice, under the ceiling, there are statues symbolising  Russian army victories in the 15-19th centuries. The marble  plaques on the walls and pylons bear gold-lettered designations  of military units that distinguished themselves in battles and  the names of the holders of St. George, among them prominent  Russian military and naval leaders: Suvorov, Kutuzov, Ushakov  and Nakhimov.    The greeting ceremony in the Kremlin will be immmediately  followed by bilateral talks between the presidents of Russia and  the U.S. In-between their talks, the two presidents are to take  a stroll about the Kremlin grounds. It is not yet known what  landmarks President Clinton will want to take in but he is sure  to take interest in the cathedral square featuring Assumption,  Annunciation and Archangel Cathedrals, the bell tower of Ivan  the Great and other world-famed monuments of ancient Russian  architecture.    The Hall of Facets adjacent to the Grand Kremlin Palace is  rightfully reckoned a national architecture monument. The  majestic and spacious hall, decorated with wall painting dealing  with biblical subjects, is intended for state ceremonies.  Territorial councils used to sit and Russian military victories  were celebrated in it in olden times.    A state reception in honour of the U.S. President is to be  given in the Hall of Facets.</p>

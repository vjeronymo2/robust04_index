			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Miscellaneous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter requested that the Department clarify that the term ``foreign exchange transaction'' which is defined in section IV(a) of the proposed exemption as ``the exchange of the currency of one nation for the currency of another nation or a contract for such exchange'' includes options to buy or sell foreign currency. The commenter is concerned that a footnote to the supplementary information accompanying the proposed exemption which describes foreign exchange transactions as ``generally *&blank;*&blank;* either `spot', `forward', or `split''' delimits the scope of the literal language of the exemption.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenter represents that options contracts operate in a manner similar to that of forward contracts. For example, a forward contract to sell a specified sum of Yen for dollars would enable a party to sell Yen at the agreed upon rate even if the value of Yen declined over the time period covered by the forward contract; the same forward contract would require the counterparty to buy Yen from the party at a rate favorable to the counterparty if the Yen appreciated during the same time period. A similar economic result could be achieved if the party had bought an option to sell Yen at the forward contract rate, and sold an option to buy Yen at the same rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After considering this comment, the Department has decided to amend the final exemption to specifically include options to buy or sell currency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter requested that the Department expand the final exemption to include relief from section 406 (b)(1) &amp; (b)(2) of the Act and section 4975(c)(1)(E) of the Code so that it would be clear that a fiduciary bank would not violate those provisions when it engaged in a foreign exchange transaction if it did not exercise its fiduciary authority to cause the plan to pay it an additional fee. The regulations at 29 CFR 2550.408b&hyph;2(e)(2) specifically state that a fiduciary does not engage in an act described in section 406(b)(1) of the Act if the fiduciary does not use any of the authority, control or responsibility which makes such person a fiduciary to cause a plan to pay additional fees for a service furnished by such fiduciary. Accordingly, the Department has determined that it is unnecessary to modify the final exemption as requested.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, for purposes of clarity, the Department has added a definition to section IV of the class exemption. Paragraph (g) defines the term ``employee benefit plan'' for purposes of this class exemption.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> General Information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The attention of interested persons is directed to the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2) of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest or disqualified person from certain other provisions of the Act and the Code, including any prohibited transaction provisions to which the exemption does not apply and the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of the Act which require, among other things, that a fiduciary discharge his duties respecting the plan solely in the interests of the participants and beneficiaries of the plan and in a prudent fashion in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(B) of the Act; nor does it affect the requirement of section 401(a) of the Code that the plan must operate for the exclusive benefit of the employees of the employer maintaining the plan and their beneficiaries;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The exemption, will not extend to transactions prohibited under section 406(b) of the Act and section 4975(c)(1) (E) and (F) of the Code;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) In accordance with section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2) of the Code, and based upon the entire record, the Department finds that the exemption is administratively feasible, in the interests of plans and of their participants and beneficiaries and protective of the rights of the participants and beneficiaries of plans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The exemption is supplemental to, and not in derogation of, any other provisions of the Act and the Code, including statutory or administrative exemptions and transitional rules. Furthermore, the fact that a transaction is subject to an administrative or statutory exemption is not dispositive of whether the transaction is in fact a prohibited transaction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) The exemption is applicable to a transaction only if the conditions specified in the exemption are met.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

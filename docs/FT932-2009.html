			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / EC urged to act on jobs crisis: Summit faces calls for lower interest rates and tough Asian trade policy EC LEADERS open a two-day summit today under growing pressure to deal with the unemployment crisis in the Community, including calls by participants for a co-ordinated reduction in European interest rates and a tougher trade policy toward Asia. Spain and France are leading the pressure for new steps to stem the growing tide of unemployed, expected to top 18m this year. But the Danish presidency of the EC  - supported by the UK and Germany  - is holding firm against protectionist measures which supporters say will safeguard jobs in Europe. Trade is likely to be the most divisive issue at the Copenhagen summit, which will also endorse proposals to integrate six former communist countries in eastern and central Europe into the EC. EC leaders will also discuss how to salvage something from the collapse of the international peace initiative in Bosnia. Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, Danish prime minister, declared that the summit would mark a 'turning point', now that ratification of the Maastricht treaty was complete in Denmark and drawing closer in the UK. He was speaking after a Socialist leaders' meeting called for a co-ordinated reduction in European interest rates, warning that the Community risked a social explosion without fresh measures to promote growth. The Danish prime minister offered little prospect that EC leaders would reach any agreement beyond a general exhortation on the need for greater economic policy co-ordination and public investment. On the call for lower interest rates, he cautioned about possible negative reaction from the markets and opposition from the German Bundesbank. Mr John Major, the prime minister, last night endorsed calls for lower European interest rates but emphasised that Britain did not have high borrowing costs. In a clear reference to the effect of German rates on those countries whose currencies remain in the European exchange rate mechanism, he said: 'That Europe as a whole would benefit from lower interest rates I think is beyond doubt, but that is a matter which must be discussed among those who find themselves locked together.' In his presentation today, Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, is expected to reject a retreat from the European welfare state. An aide said: 'He will focus not on whether to keep the European system of social protection, but how.' Mr Major is expected to attack what he perceives as unnecessary employment costs, such as the Maastricht treaty's social chapter. EC diplomats predicted friction if Mr Major pushed his case for greater deregulation too hard, or if he sounded a triumphalist note now that the EC is reconsidering social policies it supported in the more upbeat economic period before the signing of the Maastricht treaty. Along with Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, Mr Major is also likely to oppose calls from France for limited protectionism and urge leaders to renew efforts to reach a Gatt Uruguay Round agreement by the end of the year.

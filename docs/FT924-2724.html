			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Asian growth to accelerate ECONOMIC growth in the world's fastest growing region, Asia's developing and newly-industrialised countries (NICs), is set to accelerate from 6 per cent this year to 7 per cent in 1993, says a forecast published yesterday by the Institute of Developing Economies, a Japanese government-backed research institute. The acceleration of growth follows a year in which the region's economies, while slowing from the 7.3 per cent expansion of 1990, moved forward largely on the basis of internally generated demand and investment. Next year promises stronger growth because some governments in the region are expected to ease monetary policy following a period when interest rates were raised to combat inflation and deteriorating current account balances. The forecasts are based on an econometric modelling of the four NICs  - South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore  - and Asean members Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines. Thailand is expected to post the highest rate of expansion next year, at 8.5 per cent, against an estimated 7.5 per cent this year, thanks to an increase of public investment and a recovery in foreign direct investment. Malaysian growth is expected to slow, from 8.3 per cent to 7.8 per cent, following the expiry of an incentive scheme for foreign direct investment.</p>

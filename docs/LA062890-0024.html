			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PUBLIC URGED TO CUT WATER USE 10%  </P> <P> Citing the continuing drought in California, the Torrance City Council on  Tuesday passed a resolution declaring a water shortage and urging water users  to voluntarily reduce consumption by 10%. The resolution also called for a  public information campaign to encourage water conservation.  </P> <P> The measure, which is similar to one approved two years ago, asks residents to  take such steps as checking faucets for leaks, installing low-flow plumbing  devices and adjusting sprinklers to avoid waste.  </P> <P> "It's a reaffirmation of our stand," said Councilwoman Dee Hardison.  </P> <P> Councilman Dan Walker objected to an item in the resolution urging restaurants  not to serve drinking water unless the customer requests it. He agreed with the  other items, he said.  </P> <P> If the four-year drought continues, municipal officials said, the city may have  to look at mandatory reductions and penalties for those violating conservation  guidelines.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 18, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> REDONDO WANTS COURT TO DECIDE WHETHER CITY MUST REBUILD THE PIER  </P> <P> The Redondo Beach City Council has called off official debate over the future  of the damaged Redondo Pier until a court determines whether the city has a  legal obligation to rebuild it.  </P> <P> City Atty. Gordon Phillips, who recommended the legal route, said a ruling  could be issued in three to four months and would cover a number of related  issues, such as the design and size of a new or rebuilt structure -- if the  court finds that the city must restore the pier.  </P> <P> About half of the pier was destroyed by ocean storms and a fire last year. The  council voted in November to rebuild, but that decision soon faltered in the  face of vocal opposition from some residents. They demanded a referendum on the  issue, while others at numerous public hearings urged the council to proceed  with the project.  </P> <P> Council members Thursday expressed relief over prospects of another  jurisdiction resolving the contentious and increasingly complex pier question.  </P> <P> "It's the smartest and safest way to get the issue settled and avoid litigation  in the future," said Councilman Stevan Colin. "We had the cart before the  horse, but now I think we're back on the right track."  </P> <P> He and other officials noted that city political campaigns earlier this year  were a factor in delaying council decisions on rebuilding the pier.  </P> <P> Phillips and City Manager Tim Casey said the idea of calling on the courts was  prompted by a council decision Aug. 1 to hire a consultant to draw up various  design plans before deciding whether to call a referendum on the pier's future.  </P> <P> However, that approach "ignores one basic legal question that remains  unresolved and raises several more," Casey told the council Wednesday.  </P> <P> He recalled that Phillips, in August, 1988, offered his opinion that the city  had no legal obligation to restore the destroyed portion of the pier, while  lawyers for the leaseholder, Pier Properties, said it did.  </P> <P> "Without resolving this conflict now," Casey said, "the city may be developing  planning options, raising public expectations and seeking voter commitment to  one or more project designs that could be legally invalidated at a later date."  </P> <P> Other questions the court will be asked to answer, Casey said, include whether  the city can construct a public building on a new pier, whether a new pier  would have to be exactly the same shape and design as the structure destroyed  last year, and whether Pier Properties would have any rights if the city  chooses to build a pier whose boundaries would lie wholly or partly outside the  present leasehold.  </P> <P> Jay Robinson, a general partner in Pier Properties, said he will also welcome a  court resolution of the legal issues.  </P> <P> "I have agreed that it's the best way to go," he said. "Let's get squared away  in language that people understand."  </P> <P> Robinson's lease, which covers the destroyed portion of the pier, was obtained  from the city in 1962 and runs for another 40 years, he said.  </P> <P> Phillips said he would file the city's request for declaratory relief in  Torrance Superior Court. In such an action, the court is asked to interpret  legal issues and questions arising from them.  </P></p>

The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, general secretary of  the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea and  president of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea,  delivered a New Year address at the joint meeting.    His New Year address reads in full:    Dear comrades, compatriots, brothers and sisters,    Today we are ringing out 1993, a brilliant year which has  been marked with a heroic struggle and great exploits, and  ringing in a new year 1994, full of confidence and optimism.    On the occasion of the new year, I extend warm  congratulations and fervent greetings to our working class,  cooperative farmers, intellectuals, officers and men of the  People's Army, and all the other people who have been working  hard with devotion for the socialist cause of chuche, with  unfailing loyalty to the party and the revolution.    My warm congratulations and compatriotic greetings also go  to  our brothers in the South, our fellow Koreans in Japan, and all  the other Koreans abroad who have been striving for the peaceful  reunification of the country.    I also extend my new year greetings to the progressive  people  and our friends on the five continents who value justice and  peace and are advancing towards a new world of independence.    1993 was a historic year which powerfully demonstrated the  validity of our party's revolutionary line of independence and  the might of chuche Korea.    Last year the imperialists and reactionaries worked more  malignantly than ever to isolate and stifle our Republic and  crush our cause of socialism. As a result, the situation in our  country became extremely tense. When the country and the  revolution were faced with a stern trial, our party took  resolute self-defensive measures by declaring the state of  semi-war for the whole country, all the people and the entire  Army in order to cope with the prevailing situation. It called  on all the people to meet the enemy's challenge and bring about  a great upsurge in socialist construction in the same  revolutionary spirit and militant stamina as they had displayed  during the years of the grim fatherland liberation war.    The officers and men of our heroic People's Army and all the  people, in hearty response to the party's militant call, stood  up as one man in the struggle to defend the country's  sovereignty and revolutionary achievements with an unshakable  confidence in victory and in soaring spirits, foiled the enemy's  challenge and aggressive scheme and honourably safeguarded the  dignity and security of their socialist motherland. Thus they  fully demonstrated the unbreakable spirit of chuche Korea. This  means the victory of our party's revolutionary line, a great  victory of the single-hearted unity of the leader, the party and  the masses.    Last year, while achieving one victory after another under  the party's leadership in the political and military  confrontation with the enemy, our people brilliantly adorned the  last year of the Third Seven-Year Plan by accelerating the  construction of the socialist economy with great revolutionary  enthusiasm. During the Third Seven-Year Plan we made long  strides in all fields of socialist economic construction in  spite of the enormous difficulties and obstacles caused in  economic construction by unexpected international events and the  tension in our country.    The production capacity of our chuche-orientated industry  has  been considerably expanded as a whole, the level of its  technical equipment greatly raised and the structure of its  branches has been improved still more, thus further increasing  its independence and capabilities. In agriculture grand  nature-harnessing projects to complete irrigation on a high  level have been carried out victoriously, a great advance made  in its mechanization and in the application of chemicals, and  agricultural science and technology have developed still further  in keeping with the requirements of the chuche farming method,  with the result that a solid foundation of agricultural  production has been laid to ensure a bumper crop every year.  Numerous monumental creations such as magnificent and splendid  Kwangbok and Tongil Streets, the monument to the victorious  fatherland liberation war, the three-revolution exhibition and  the May Day Stadium were built in Pyongyang during the Third  Seven-Year Plan in accordance with our party's plan for the  construction of the capital. They graphically illustrate the  unfathomable creative force of our working people and the might  of our independent national economy and clearly symbolize the  heroic mettle of socialist Korea which is advancing triumphantly  in spite of any upheavals in the world situation.    Under our people-centred socialist system our people enjoy a  worthy and happy life on an equal basis free from any social and  political unrest and without any worries about their life even  in the present complex situation, and a beautiful communist  morality is flowering further throughout our society, the people  sharing weal and woe and helping and leading each other forward,  on the principle of one for all and all for one.    Through the recent harsh trials and struggle we have  convincingly proved once again that our party is a great party  possessing an iron will and capable of seasoned leadership, that  our people are a heroic people having unshakable revolutionary  confidence and unbreakable fighting spirit, and that the  socialism of our own style embodying the chuche idea is an  unconquerable socialism which has struck its roots deep among  the popular masses.    I express my warm gratitude to our workers, farmers,  intellectuals, the soldiers of the People's Army and all the  rest of our people who, under the party's leadership, performed  brilliant exploits last year in the revolution and construction.    The new year 1994 is a year of a revolutionary advance when  the building of socialism in our country will enter a new stage  of development; it is a year of a worthy struggle for the entire  party, the whole country and all the people to make an all-out  effort and effect a great revolutionary upsurge on all fronts.    The internal and external situation of our revolution is  still complex and tense, and we are building socialism in a  sharp confrontation with the enemy.    To meet the requirements of the present situation and the  development of our revolution we must carry out the  revolutionary line of independence, self-sufficiency and  self-reliant defence and expedite the three revolutions --  ideological, technical and cultural -- to further increase the  political, economic and military power of the country. We must  consolidate and exploit the successes we have already achieved  in the socialist construction and must score a fresh, greater  success. In this way we will add glory to the socialism of our  country centred on the popular masses and fly the socialist  banner of chuche higher.    Setting the next three years as a period for adjustment in  the sector of socialist economic construction as decided at the  twenty-first plenary meeting of the Sixth Party Central  Committee, we must in this period implement to the letter the  agriculture-first, light industry-first and foreign trade-first  policy. Along with this, we must give definite precedence to  the coal industry, power industry and rail transport, which must  advance ahead of the other sectors of the national economy, and  must continue to develop the metal industry.    By carrying out the revolutionary economic strategy of our  party during the period of adjustment for socialist economic  construction we will consolidate the foundations of the nation's  independent economy rock-solid, further improve the people's  standard of living to meet the socialist requirements and secure  a new launching point for scaling a higher eminence of socialism.    This year we must concentrate our effort on the development  of agriculture, light industry and foreign trade.    This is a meaningful year which will mark the 30th  anniversary of the publishing of the theses on the socialist  rural question in our country. By striving to carry out the  historic tasks set in the theses, we must make a new advance in  the development of the rural economy. We must consolidate the  successes achieved in the irrigation and electrification of the  rural areas, raise the level of mechanization and application of  chemicals, implement the chuche farming method thoroughly and  thus boost grain and all other agricultural production. Our  working class must increase the production of tractors, lorries  and other modern farm machines, fertilizers, agricultural  chemicals and a variety of other farming materials, and send  them to the rural communities. All the cooperative farmers and  agricultural working people must work in an assiduous and  methodical manner with an attitude befitting masters who are  responsible for the nation's granaries so as to attain without  fail the high goal of grain production set by the party for this  year.    We must step up the revolution in light industry and effect  a  great upsurge in the production of consumer goods. We must  adopt positive measures to improve and reinforce the light  industry factories, modernize them, and increase the production  of chemical fibres, synthetic resin and other materials for  light industry. In this way, we will operate all the light  industry factories at full capacity and maintain a high and  steady rate of production. All the sectors and units ranging  from those in the large-scale central light industry to those in  the medium and small-scale local industry and those engaged in  the production of "August 3 consumer goods" must produce various  kinds of consumer goods in large quantities, increase their  variety and improve their qualities radically.    In order to adapt foreign trade to the changed circumstances  and develop it, we must cultivate new foreign markets in every  possible way and build up an unquestionable reputation. We must  strengthen the bases for the production of export goods in many  sectors of the national economy, increase their production and  improve their qualities. All the sectors and regions must  further boost export by exploring and using the resources for  export and also develop processing trade.    In order to develop agriculture and light industry and  accelerate economic construction throughout the country, we must  put efforts into the coal, electric power and metal industries  and find a better solution to the problem of rail transport.  The coal and electric power industries must make effective use  of the existing production bases and create more production  capacity in order to increase coal and power production greatly.  We must strengthen the material and technical foundations of  the railways, organize and direct transportation meticulously,  lay heavy-duty rails extensively and satisfy the ever-increasing  demands of the national economy for transport.    All the economic sectors and units must launch a vigorous  campaign for increased production and economy as a mass movement  and make effective use of the existing labour, equipment and  materials. They must tap potential reserves to the full to  increase production to the maximum.    All the economic officials must organize economic work and  direct production efficiently in accordance with the party's  economic strategy. They must give full rein to the people's  revolutionary enthusiasm and creative activity and encourage  them to overfulfill this year's national economic plan.    Our intellectuals have an honourable duty to contribute  their  scientific knowledge and skills to socialist construction.  Adhering to our party's policy of cultural revolution, they  must strive devotedly to make new advances in science,  education, literature and art, public health and all other  fields of developing socialist culture.    This year, too, we must naturally put efforts into  strengthening the country's defence power to counter the enemy's  moves to provoke war. We must be fully prepared politically and  ideologically, militarily and materially, to deal with any  contingency on our initiative; we must establish a social  climate of regarding military affairs as important and assisting  the People's Army whole-heartedly.    In order to push ahead with the revolution and construction  in the present situation, we must hold fast to our party's  policy of the ideological revolution, further strengthen the  single-hearted unity of the revolutionary ranks and fully  display the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance.    Single-hearted unity and self-reliance are imperishable,  glorious traditions of our revolution as well as the banner of  victory. With the strength of single-hearted unity we have  broken through harsh trials and opened up a brilliant road of  victory; with the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance we have  overcome all difficulties and brought about great changes in the  revolution and construction. When all the people are united  with a single heart behind the party and the leader and fight  courageously, displaying a high revolutionary spirit of  self-reliance and fortitude, we can defend and develop the  socialism of our own style for ever in whatever trials and  accomplish the socialist cause of chuche victoriously.    We must defend like the apple of our eye the single-hearted  unity of our revolutionary ranks that has been cemented  rock-solid under the leadership of our party and consolidate and  develop it further.    We must display higher the revolutionary spirit of  self-reliance and fortitude, break through difficulties in our  way and effect a fresh upsurge in the building of socialism.  "Let us accelerate vigorously the general march of socialism in  the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude" this is  the call of our party and the militant slogan which our people  must uphold today. All the officials, party members and other  working people must, in hearty response to the party's militant  call, make continued innovations and uninterrupted advance in  the spirit of Chollima spurred by the "speed of the '90s" and  make the new year 1994 a year of historic advance in the  revolution and construction in our country.    To reunify the country is the supreme task of our nation  which must not be delayed. We must accomplish the cause of  national reunification as soon as possible, so as to meet the  unanimous, ardent desire of the entire nation and hand down the  reunified country to our posterity.    With a view to paving the way to national reunification by  the united effort of the nation, our party and the government of  our Republic put forward "10-point programme of the great unity  of the whole nation for the reunification of the country" last  year and made all our efforts to put it into effect. This  10-point programme embodies the noble desire of our 70 million  compatriots to achieve a solid unity of the whole nation  transcending the difference in ideology, ideal and system and  realise reunification and prosperity of our nation with a long  history of five thousand years. We hoped the South Korean  authorities to take the road of reconciliation and cooperation  in response to our 10-point programme of great national unity,  we also made an important proposal for an exchange of top-level  special envoys between the two sides.    But the South Korean authorities have taken the path of  dependence on foreign forces, not national independence, and of  confrontation between North and South, not national unity, by  ignoring our magnanimous proposal and the desire of the entire  nation for reunification. They have staged large-scale military  exercises against our Republic frequently in collusion with  foreign forces and have been jeopardizing North-South relations  by clamouring for "military counteraction" and an "international  cooperation system" on the pretext of our "nuclear problem."    The so-called "civilian" regime in South Korea is only a  disguise; in fact it does not differ from the successive  military dictatorial regimes. The evil anti-communist fascist  laws still remain intact in South Korea, and the desire of the  South Korean people for independence, democracy and national  reunification is not fulfilled. It is natural that the South  Korean people and public figures say that there is no need to  watch the present South Korean regime any longer and that they  have nothing to expect from it.    As for our "nuclear problem" about which the United States  and her lackeys are making a fuss, it is the product of the  obstinate maneuvers of the United States against socialism and  our Republic. It is the United States that has created the  fictitious "doubt about nuclear development by the North", and  it is the United States that has actually shipped nuclear  weapons into the Korean peninsula and have been threatening us.  Therefore, the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula must on  any account be settled through Korea-U.S. talks.    Pressure or threat will have no effect on us; such an  attempt  may invite catastrophe, far from finding a solution to the  problem. The United States must see all the fact squarely and  behave with prudence. Since a joint statement has been adopted  by Korea and the United States, the nuclear problem on the  Korean peninsula can be settled fairly if both sides keep and  implement the principles that have been agreed upon.    The principles and the line of our party and the government  of our Republic on national reunification remain unchanged. In  future, too, we will make every effort to reunify the country in  the form of confederation which is based on one nation, one  state, two systems and two governments, on the three principles  of independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity.    The destiny of the motherland is immediately the destiny of  the nation, as well as the destiny of all our compatriots at  home and abroad. All the Korean people in the North, in the  South and abroad must launch a nationwide struggle, rallied as  one under the banner of great unity of the whole nation, and  open a new phase for national reunification this year.    The imperialists are now blustering on the international  arena by vociferating about the "end" of socialism, but they  cannot arrest the people's aspiration to independence,  sovereignty and socialism nor can they turn back the trend of  history. If the world progressive people push forward  historical progress by strengthening unity and solidarity under  the banner of independence against imperialism, they will be  able to shape a bright future of mankind at an earliest date  without fail.    Our party and the government of our Republic will  consistently implement the foreign policy of independence, peace  and friendship in keeping with the requirements of the present  situation. On the principle of independence we will make  positive efforts to unite with socialist countries and  non-aligned countries and develop good neighbourly relations  also with capitalist countries which respect the sovereignty of  our country. The government of our Republic will work hard to  abolish the old international political and economic orders of  domination and subordination, establish new ones on the basis of  equality, justice and fairness and develop South-South  cooperation on the principle of collective self-reliance.    Our people's struggle today is arduous, but it is a noble  and  honourable struggle for the prosperity of our country and for  the future of mankind. Our people who are fighting for the just  cause under the leadership of the great party will always emerge  victorious.    Let all of us fight on vigorously to achieve a new success  in  socialist construction and hasten the independent and peaceful  reunification of the country, united rock-solid behind the party  Central Committee under the unfurled banner of the chuche idea.</p>

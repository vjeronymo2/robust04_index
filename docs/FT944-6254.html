			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Public Spending): Local councils and transport lose out - Public sector The Budget promises a bleak four years ahead for public sector employees, apart from the police and those engaged in the planned growth sectors of education and health services such as further education. For the rest, pay freezes, reductions in staffing levels and cuts in programmes are the hallmarks of the Budget - although the government hopes they will be offset by an increase in private finance for public sector capital investment projects under the private finance initiative. The principal winners in this year's tough public spending round are the health and education departments, which secured 1 per cent real growth in their budgets. For health, this comes on top of a 3.8 per cent real increase in the current year. The main losers are local government and transport, each set to suffer a cut in their budget allowing for inflation. Unemployment and social security benefit claimants will have their incomes uprated in line with inflation. But those reliant on housing benefit may suffer from the government's decision no longer to meet the full cost of rents deemed to be excessive. It may prove difficult to deliver the real reduction in spending totals which Mr Kenneth Clarke has promised. Last year's Budget anticipated a steep 1.3 per cent real reduction in government spending in 1994-5. Now it is forecast to have risen, in real terms, by 1.4 per cent. Mr Clarke hopes to improve on this outcome next year, delivering a 0.8 per cent real reduction in spending. But this year's experience may indicate that lowering cash targets by enough to account fully for both lower inflation and lower real spending is easier said than done. Mr Clarke announced that the total figure for 'general government expenditure' would be Pounds 43bn lower than previously anticipated by the 1997-98 financial year - implying a cut of about 13 per cent in projected spending. Much of that reduction is accounted for by lower than expected inflation, and by the financing of an increasing proportion of public sector capital spending projects - notably transport schemes - through the private finance initiative. However, in its reliance on private finance, the Budget raises the critical issue of the freedom of public institutions to pay back their private financiers through user charges. For instance, Mr Clarke boasted that universities are currently meeting a third of their capital funding from private sources. The need to repay large private loans can only increase pressure from universities to be allowed to charge higher fees, some of which are bound to be passed directly to students. The number employed in the civil service and local government - outside education - will fall sharply if the policy unveiled in the Budget is sustained. Mr Clarke announced a cash freeze in central government running costs until 1997-98, which means a reduction of about 10 per cent in real terms. He made no attempt to disguise the impact on staffing, saying that he expected the number employed in Whitehall departments and agencies to fall significantly below 500,000. Numbers are already falling. Every department is engaged in a review of staffing requirements, with large cuts announced or imminent. Senior officials are not exempt: last month the Treasury announced the shedding of a quarter of its top posts. Customs and Excise is set to be the next in line. Unions claimed last night that a review to be announced today would result in the loss of more than 4,000 jobs from its 25,000-strong workforce. The government has less immediate control over local authorities, which in England alone employ about 2m people and have budgets totalling Pounds 45bn. However, ministers clearly expect that by imposing a real-terms cut on local councils - grants to local authorities in England will rise by only 0.8 per cent in cash terms for existing programmes - town halls will be forced to follow Whitehall's lead. Councillors face a fraught year ahead. Despite the Budget cuts, they will have to meet rising demand for education, their principal service, and they are under strong pressure from local electors to provide more nursery schools without any earmarked funds from the government. The clamour for more law and order spending is also set to continue. The government clearly hopes that its 1 per cent real increase in health spending will prevent further controversy about the future of the National Health Service. Spending will rise to Pounds 32bn, which the health department believes will be enough to meet commitments that patients will not have to wait more than 18 months for treatment.</p>

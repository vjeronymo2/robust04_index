			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Letter: Compact discs: consider other cases of over-pricing  -and a market at work (1) Sir, If we are to have a campaign against the restrictive practices which cause over-pricing, why start with compact discs ('OFT may refer compact disc industry for inquiry', April 30, Leading article and subsequent articles)? The costs of allegedly over-priced CDs pale into insignificance when compared with the effects of many government-endorsed schemes. Why not look first at motor vehicles (restrictions of Japanese imports) or food (the Common Agricultural Policy)? After all, these represent a more significant and essential part of most people's daily expenditure. CDs are a luxury; no one has to buy them.

			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> APPRECIATIONS;  </P> <P> THE ONE-MAN VARIETY SHOW NAMED SAMMY DAVIS JR.  </P> <P> There have been a lot of balladeers, a lot of dancers, a lot of clowns, a lot  of mimics, a lot of actors who could do both comedy and the heavy stuff. But no  one comes to mind who was all of those talents to such a superlative degree as  Sammy Davis Jr., who on Wednesday lost his brave battle with throat cancer.  </P> <P> He was a one-man variety show, every act on the damnedest vaudeville bill  anybody ever watched. He was all the floats in the big parade, a cast of  hundreds (it sometimes seemed) contained in one slight frame that had to be  composed entirely of pure genius and pure energy.  </P> <P> It was not just that Sammy Davis Jr. could do so many different things; it was  that he did them all so amazingly well. In the space of half an hour he could  make you think of everybody from Bojangles Robinson and Al Jolson to Nat Cole,  to cite only a few from a whole galaxy of audience-holding entertainers whose  equal he was.  </P> <P> At the start of the '60s, one of the best reasons anybody had for going to Las  Vegas was to catch what came to be called the Rat Pack: Frank Sinatra, Dean  Martin, Peter Lawford and Sammy. Their appearance at the Sands Hotel was the  toughest ticket in town.  </P> <P> Considered historically, it might be that their high jinks and their heavy  joshing would be found a bit self-indulgent and even self-conscious, a kind of  every-night boys' night out. But the saving grace was that Frank and Dean and  Sammy were talented and charismatic performers who, as ballplayers say of a  fast pitcher, could really bring it. If there was anything to forgive, you  forgave it when the singing started.  </P> <P> Sammy's role was as the mascot of the group, and the kidding was (so my own  memory says) not always comfortable for the audience and possibly not always  comfortable for him. But the role was also a bit of a disguise, like the rube  who turns out to be the real pool shark. When the stage was his, he knocked the  audience sideways, and it became wonderfully clear that the honors, talentwise,  were equally divided up there.  </P> <P> (It's hard now to remember exactly what Lawford's function was in the  free-for-alls: a kind of bemused charm, I guess. The sadness about him was yet  to come.)  </P> <P> The gifts and the magical stage presence that Sammy Davis Jr. had were honed  and polished in a hard school that began for him at an age when most of his  contemporaries were still wearing diapers at night. As he wrote in a couple of  notably candid and moving autobiographies, he spent years trouping when a good  audience was one that let you get off stage uninjured; years when, talented or  not, he was handcuffed to Jim Crow.  </P> <P> Even in Las Vegas in the times of his first triumphs, the color line separated  the stage from the lounges and the tables like an iron curtain, to keep the  high-rollers content. Over there in Las Vegas, and among black entertainers,  one of the things Davis will be remembered for most gratefully was his role  (with Sinatra's help) in breaking down the color line.  </P> <P> Thanks to his own candor about himself, Davis' life was widely known to be a  kind of cautionary tale, a three-act play divided into the rise to fame, the  costs of fame and, at last, the rewards of fame. He left no doubt that he  hadn't handled success well. He had worked hard and for a time he enjoyed hard,  making a mess of things until he got his act together again (with some  chastening help from Sinatra).  </P> <P> What kind of fool was he? His own kind, but the point the world could note at  last was that he stopped playing the fool and revealed the strength that had  got him past all the earlier hazards, including the wreck that cost him an eye  and nearly his life.  </P> <P> The rallying around him when he fell ill said a good deal about Sammy Davis Jr.  His talent had spoken for itself; his kindness and his humanity revealed  themselves in the loyalty of his friends.  </P></p>

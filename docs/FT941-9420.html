			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Over-priced auditing Sir, As a small, financially uncomplicated, five-man service business, (700 invoices a year, nil stocks, PAYE-based remuneration, and with no unearned income), we tended to devote our energies to developing the business and left the accounting and auditing to the accountants. Creeping suspicion at their escalating charges over four years finally caused us to seek alternative quotes, resulting in a reduction of more than 60 per cent in accounting/auditing charges from the firm which were to become our new accountants. Accordingly, we dismissed our previous accountants because of their excessive charges. Apart from the money, our main grievance is that our ex-accountants persist in referring to their dismissal as resignation in letters to the authorities. While this is probably an isolated incident, we wonder if any of your other readers have experience of similarly isolated incidents? Brian Moore, Heatherley Cottage, 4 Heatherley Road, Camberley, Surrey GU15 3LW</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ciro Ortega; from the "RPC Television News" </F> newscast]    [Text] Panama's oil debt with Venezuela and Mexico, within  the framework of the San Jose Pact, totals $240 million, and  paying it will have to be done on a long-term basis, Eduardo  Linares, deputy planning and economic policy minister, has said.    The top government official has said Venezuela is not  pressuring Panama to pay the debt but, rather, is simply  requesting the renewal of talks.    [Begin recording] [Linares] We have just received an  official  communication from the Venezuelan Government stating its  interest in resuming the talks; therefore, we cannot talk of  pressure. What does exist is a response to our request as a  responsible government in order to pay to the debt.    [Ortega] To pay in what type of manner? This involves many  millions. The budget was cut, and there is no money.    [Linares] The formulas we have proposed to the Mexican  Government and the one we could reach with Venezuela if we agree  to resume negotiations allow the government to pay its debt  within its capabilities in the long term. There are no  short-term formulas, to be sure. [end recording]</p>

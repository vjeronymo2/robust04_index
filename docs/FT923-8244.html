			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Odinga suspended by party Kenya's main opposition FORD party teetered on the verge of a total split yesterday after one of its squabbling factions announced the suspension of veteran leader and Interim Chairman Jaramogi Oginga Odinga, Reuter reports from Nairobi. 'FORD's executive committee has suspended Odinga because of his disregard of party rules in running members' affairs and his becoming a dictator,' the Forum for the Restoration of Democracy (FORD) secretary-general Mr Martin Shikuku said. Just six months after it was legalised, FORD is divided on how to select a candidate to face President Moi and the ruling KANU party in the country's first multi-party elections in 26 years.</p>

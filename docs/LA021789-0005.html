			<p><P> February 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLEAN-AIR CRUNCH  </P> <P> Southern California's balmy climate and bustling economy have conspired to lure  enough people to the region to fill in most of its wide-open spaces, in the air  as well as on the land.  </P> <P> So far the land is bearing up reasonably well. The air is not. There was an  unhealthful amount of ozone in Southern California's air on 180 days last year.  Houston and New York City are not even close seconds at 20 days a year. It is  the only area in the nation that still fails to meet health standards on  nitrogen oxides, which are byproducts of burning fuels in anything from cars to  power mowers. Last year the number of bad ozone days climbed again after  several years of falling. All this remains the case nearly 20 years after  scientists persuaded Congress to pass the Clean Air Act because living in dirty  air is bad for people.  </P> <P> There is more to come. There will be nearly half again as many cars in the Los  Angeles air basin 20 years from now. Population will increase from its present  13 million to 18 million. In the natural course of events the air will get  dirtier with each new car and each new power mower.  </P> <P> A month from today the South Coast Air Quality Management District -- the lead  smog agency for Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino and Riverside counties --  will vote on a plan to change the natural course of events. The plan is the  most comprehensive anti-pollution program ever drafted anywhere in the world.  Despite its scope, a vote to put the plan into effect would mean changing the  habits of many Southern Californians but not fundamentally changing the way  they live.  </P> <P> Still, there is a natural resistance to change. Some of plan's proposals would  take effect rather suddenly, even though it would be 17 years before the air  was as clean as it must be. Under the circumstances the smog agency would have  a better chance of making the plan work if business was solidly behind the  program instead of sniping at it -- often with half-truths.  </P> <P> For example, the formal comment on the plan by the Los Angeles Chamber of  Commerce says that it "will cost jobs." It also says that anything that would  drive business out of the basin must be examined "with gravest concern." Other  critics put the job loss at 50,000.  </P> <P> The job-loss figure is half-fact. The Southern California Assn. of Governments  estimates that the region will create 1.4 million new jobs during the 20 years  after the clean-air plan takes hold. By one estimate, the number of new jobs  might be 50,000 higher if business did not have to contend with new pollution  controls. It can easily be argued that without new controls the number of new  jobs would fall well short of 1.4 million because companies would look  elsewhere for cleaner air. As The Times reported on Thursday, one-third of  Southern California's executive recruiters say that smog already is a major  factor when candidates pass up jobs in the basin.  </P> <P> Trying to crush the district plan, Southern California Edison Co. promotes an  alternative in which trapping hydrocarbons and other organic gases from  escaping into the air would be emphasized over controls on nitrogen oxides.  Smog is created when sunlight cooks an airborne mixture of nitrogen oxides and  hydrocarbons.  </P> <P> Edison says that its plan would get rid of ozone faster and at less cost, which  may or may not be half-true -- depending on which air chemist you consult. In  any event the plan would meet health standards only for ozone, not for nitrogen  oxides or soot and other particulates. Thus the Edison plan would not meet  federal clean-air standards.  </P> <P> Edison cites the high cost of trapping nitrogen oxides at its power plants as  one reason for adopting its alternative. But manufacturers of such controls  told district officials recently that the utility estimate of the cost of  controls is four times the actual cost and that prices for controls are still  falling. The inflated figure just intensifies questions about the rest of its  plan.  </P> <P> Opponents of the smog agency's plan have been acting as though Southern  California faced a choice only between the official plan and the Edison  substitute. In fact, there is a third -- far worse -- option. The U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency has agreed to impose its own plan to clean up  the air in 1990 if Southern California's smog agency hesitates to start along a  path that will meet federal air-quality standards; the agency made the promise  to settle a suit brought by the Sierra Club and the Coalition for Clean Air.  The federal government has no authority to intervene in some areas reserved to  local law, so it could not use land-use planning and some other devices that  the air-quality district intends to use. To make up for that, federal controls  on sources over which Washington does have authority would need to be far more  severe than what the smog district has in mind. Southern California might be  able to live with a federal plan, but should not bet its future on it. It can  avoid the gamble if business leaders will face up to the fact that the air  district's plan is the best that they can get and start supporting it.  </P></p>

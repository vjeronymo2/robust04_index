			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Profits warning clips 9p from UB share price Shares in United Biscuits fell 9p to 419p yesterday after Mr Robert Clarke, chairman, warned the annual meeting that there would be 'some overall decline' in the group's first-half profits. He blamed this on 'a disappointing first quarter performance and a slower than anticipated uplift in the second quarter' at Keebler, the US biscuits subsidiary. Last March, Mr Clarke said there had been no sign of an upturn in UB's main markets in either the UK or the US. He told yesterday's meeting that the position had 'not fundamentally changed'. There were now some small signs of recovery in the UK, but US consumers were continuing to trade down to lower value products, thereby impacting on Keebler's branded products. Mr Clarke expected the rest of UB's business to at least match the previous year's outcome.</p>

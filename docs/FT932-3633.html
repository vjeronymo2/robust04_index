			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Love and peace and (lost) dreams - The Sixties are back - and we've never had it so bad THE Sixties are in. In and groovy again, as the woolly liberal outfit lovingly dusts down its memories of Paris in 1968. They were there: Left Bank and Right On, hanging loose and tripping hard; forging iron in the soul, growing grass on the brain. All right, they argue now, we never did get love and peace: but at least we tried. We had ideals, we had dreams. If we tilted at the law, we did it with flowers and beautiful intentions. When we danced to the sound of breaking glass, we were really gyrating to hope-heavy vibes. It was all in the cause of a better world, you see: the youth of today just don't care . . . I have some problems with this. Yeah. I take a kind of griefy view of all that stuff. Including the wretched parlance of sub-McLuhan communication. My own theory is that the 1960s are responsible for just about everything that currently poisons our existence. I asserted as much to one of the decade's apologists, who has challenged me to document this slur on her kaftan-clad peers. And don't go on about Sir Hugh Casson's carbuncles, she said, because the South Bank complex started in 1951. Well, here is part of my answer: the first entries of an alphabetical catalogue of 1960s catastrophes, duly omitting Hugh Casson and his blocks for commissars. You might prefer to think of these two simply as a disastrous aristocratic couple; or as the two most horrible components of one annus horribilis, 1963. Beeching, Lord. Checking his vignette in Anthony Sampson's Anatomy of Britain, I find Beeching commended for his surgical ruthlessness and hailed as a hero. Poor Anthony Sampson. But the real victims of Beeching's butchery were not the little Welsh stationmasters who had the lobelias swept from their waiting-room windowboxes, nor the pipe-chewing peasants who boarded at Piddle Magna. They are all those hapless citizens now condemned to circulate these over-crowded, tarmac-laden isles in stinking solipsistic cars. One day - not far away - when the 64m cars have almost stunk us out of our own habitat, we shall have cause to pore over old Ordnance Survey maps, and tragically reflect that there was once a sane and sociable system of transport in our country. It would not be the first or last time that a civil servant has acted in the interests of short-term gains of efficiency: but if Beeching was a Sixties hero, then the Sixties are damned for a rotten taste in heroes. Heroes ought to have vision; if Beeching had gazed even ten years beyond his surgical axeing and pruning, he would have known that his reforms were not for the health of the nation, but its ruin. Chatterley, Lady. In spite of his beard, DH Lawrence would have been an unhappy man at Woodstock. And anyone who knows their Lawrence will appreciate that the lifting of the Chatterley ban, considered as another typical Sixties event,would have been repugnant to the author himself. As a sales stunt by Penguin Books the trial was bad enough. But if Lawrence could see the direct line of descent he spawned, from Lady Chatterley through Oh, Calcutta] to Jilly Cooper, I believe he would have chewed up his own manuscript in rage. The aim of Lady Chatterley was to get the British to stop sniggering about life below the navel. Its issue in mass paperback did nothing of the sort. Quite the opposite: prurience, formerly restricted to seaside postcards, became ubiquitous. So not only did it signal the eclipse of what Jilly Cooper so charmingly calls the 'honkless novel', but it created a new field of copy for ephemeral publication. From the Profumo affair to the toe-sucking headlines of the 1990s, we are still sniggering and itching to know. Much better to have kept Lady Chatterley as a minor collector's item, a literary curiosity. The 'permissive' Sixties seem only to have had the effect of legitimising transgression as a form of vulgar entertainment. They made the bed and forced us not only to lie in it, but nudge-nudge everyone else to advertise the fact. Shall I go on? This is a compendiously damnable list, right up to Wilson, Harold, and Zurich, gnomes of. But I rest my case.</p>

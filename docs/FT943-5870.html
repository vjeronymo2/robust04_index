			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Further gains forecast The copper price is likely to rise sharply during the final quarter of this year and into 1995 as stocks fall towards a critical four weeks' supply, according to London broker Hambros Equities UK, reports Reuters. In a special report Hambros forecast that stocks held by producers, consumers and merchants, now equivalent to 5.5 weeks' supply, would fall rapidly from mid-September, as they did between January and July. Hambros analyst Mr Christopher Pearson said copper prices could then reach 150 cents a pound, compared with about 113 cents at present. If the decline in London Metal Exchange stocks matched the pace of falls earlier this year, the total could reach 180,000 tonnes by the end of the year, the report said. 'Before allowing for any movement in producer and consumer stocks, this would lower the stocks consumption ratio by about 0.3 weeks supply to about 4.7 weeks by December 31.' Net new production of 460,000 tonnes next year was unlikely to meet rising world-wide consumption, it said. In response to synchronised economic recovery copper consumption growth of 6.5 per cent this year would be followed by a 5.8 per cent increase in 1995. Western world consumption would exceed supply in both 1994 and 1995, leading to stocks falling to three weeks availability next year. 'Below four weeks of supply, copper prices have tended to rise almost exponentially,' said Hambros. 'Therefore, we expect the price to spike above 150 cents a pound during the first half of 1995.'</p>

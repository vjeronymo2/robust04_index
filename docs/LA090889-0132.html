			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> FRIEND IS SUSPECTED IN SHOOTING DEATH  </P> <P> Police in Anaheim were searching Thursday for a 38-year-old man they said is  suspected of shooting and killing a longtime friend in his home and then  fleeing.  </P> <P> Officers found the body of Lee Madison Fox slumped in the bedroom of his house  in the 1500 block of South Dallas Drive with a gunshot wound to the head.  </P> <P> Neighbors told police that Fox had arrived home shortly before 10 p.m. on  Wednesday with a friend, said Sgt. Chet Barry. It was unclear where the two men  had been earlier, he said.  </P> <P> Within minutes, neighbors reported, a gunshot was heard and the friend ran from  the home, Barry said. When officers arrived, they discovered Fox's body leaning  against a hide-a-bed inside his single-family home.  </P> <P> Officers recovered the apparent weapon, a revolver, Barry said, and interviewed  neighbors who were acquainted with both men. However, investigators failed to  come up with a motive for the slaying, Barry said.  </P></p>

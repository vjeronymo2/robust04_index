Mr. Papandoniou  heads a government economic delegation from the ministry and  representatives of Greek chambers of commerce, various firms,  etc.    Mr. Papandoniou, whose visit to Tirana is his first foreign  trip since Greece took over the presidency of the EC, was  welcomed at Rinas Airport by Selim Belortaja, Albanian minister  for industry and trade. Khristodhoulos Tsalikis, ambassador of  the Greek Republic in Tirana, was also present.    Official talks between Belortaja and Papandoniou started  this  afternoon. In his speech, Mr. Belortaja stressed the special  importance of this meeting, which he said was a chance to  examine problems arising from proposals to further bilateral  relations in the field of the economy, and also that, in  Albania's foreign trade relations, trade and cooperation with  Greece occupy a special place. He said that trade with Greece  accounts for 14 percent of our foreign trade. Of course, such a  level of cooperation is due to the historical relations between  both peoples, the reciprocity of the economies of both  countries, and the political goodwill on the part of both  governments to further bilateral relations.    In his speech, Minister Papandoniou said that he felt it his  duty to reiterate the warm atmosphere of Greek-Albanian  relations, which have their basis in the historical ties and  cooperation between the two countries and which are being  advanced a step further with the visit of Foreign Minister  Papoulias to Tirana.    As EC president, Greece has an opportunity to help Albania  to  pass through this difficult transition period, the Greek  minister told his Albanian counterpart, promising help even  after Greece's EC presidency is over.    He also concretely specified fields of cooperation.  Attaching great importance to bilateral trade, Mr. Papandoniou  stressed that trade should be developed in the border areas and  generally be advanced in the future.    On agriculture, he presented Greece's great interest and  that  of Greek firms in increasing investment in Albania in this area  and stressed the encouragement and assistance that the Greek  Government would provide for them. The Greek National Bank  would like to open a representative office in Tirana, while the  Greek Agricultural Bank has already drafted two projects.    Leaving the issue open, Mr. Papandoniou stressed that they  would discuss it extensively in talks with experts. Electricity  production was also of interest to the Greek side and would  require broad discussion by both sides.    In his proposals, the Greek minister focused on the  possibilities of cooperation to improve Albanian ports, with the  idea of creating a joint commission of experts to carry out  relevant studies. He also briefed them on the EC project on  transportation and within this framework he offered cooperation  for joint road networks.    To conclude, Minister Papandoniou expressed optimism for the  course of bilateral relations, which, according to him, were  conditioned by the existence of the Greek minority in Albania  and Albanian citizens in Greece.    Mr. Belortaja commented on the outline that his Greek  counterpart had made about prospects for bilateral relations,  stressing that the Greek offer of cooperation was very diverse.  He also pointed out the special values of the joint commissions  in agriculture, trade, etc., and told the Greek side that it  should brief the Albanian Government on concrete issues, so as  to take the necessary decisions, which will open the way to  broader cooperation.    The Greek Government economic delegation is continuing its  working visit to Tirana.</p>

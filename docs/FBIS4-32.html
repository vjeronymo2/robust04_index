			<p>SUMMARY                                 Stressing their pique at NATO's failure to consult with Moscow in  advance of airstrikes against Bosnian Serb positions, Russian  President Boris Yeltsin, government officials, and legislators  from  across the political spectrum have condemned the raids as  ill-advised and likely to escalate the bloodshed in Bosnia. Media  commentary echoed these sentiments and warned that the NATO  actions could adversely affect Russian internal politics and  U.S.-Russian relations.                          END SUMMARY     Yeltsin was strongly critical of NATO air strikes on Bosnian Serb  positions around Gorazde and accused NATO and the United States,  in particular, of failing to consult in advance with Russia.  Yeltsin said in an 11 April press interview that "I have insisted  and I insist now" that "questions such as bombing strikes against  Serbian positions must not be decided" without prior U.S.-Russian  consultations.  He told reporters that during a telephone  conversation with U.S. President Bill Clinton early that morning  he had made the same point about consultations "again and again."  Insisting that any such action should be taken only "in  accordance with UN decisions," Yeltsin complained that the  telephone call had not clarified whether the UN Secretary General  had given the "go-ahead" for the strikes and declared that  Russia, "without a doubt," wanted the Security Council to discuss  the issue (Ostankino TV, 11 April, Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 12 April).  Stressing Russia's preference for continued negotiations, Yeltsin  told reporters in Madrid on 12 April that a settlement in Bosnia  "must come through political negotiations and not through force"  which could lead to "everlasting war" and that the blame for such  an outcome would "rest with those who took the decision" on the  strikes.  At the same time he noted that the shooting in Gorazde  had stopped and expressed the hope that the bombing "will not,  after all, lead to greater confrontation and greater bloodshed."  Continuing to display annoyance at what he termed "discrimination  against Russia," however, Yeltsin emphasized that consultations  would be held with the UN Secretary General and President Clinton  "so that this does not happen again" (Moscow TV, ITAR-TASS, 12  April).     Other Government Reaction     Other Government officials displayed similar irritation at the  lack of consultation and expressed fears that the air strikes  would jeopardize the peace negotiations and lead to a wider  conflict.  Notably some officials criticized the Serbs as well as  the Bosnian Muslims:     -- Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev called the air strikes "a big  mistake and a great risk."  He told reporters that Russia was  "worried" that the air strike decision "was made in a hurry"  without considering "possible consequences," noting that this was  why consultations were needed.  Warning like Yeltsin that the air  strikes could result in an "escalation of the conflict instead of  its suppression," he said he had "expressed his profound concern"  to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher that the world  could be "engulfed in an exchange of blows" and had urged the  West "to display the utmost restraint."  Pointing to diplomatic  efforts with the Serbs made by special envoy Vitaliy Churkin,  Kozyrev called the air strikes "especially annoying" because by 2  April he claimed there were "already signs of a political  settlement" (ITAR-TASS, 11 April).     -- Churkin criticized the UN and NATO for failing to consult with  Russia about their actions.  Warning that UN and NATO  "interference" in the conflict was leading to a "greater  confrontation," he said that he was trying to work with the  Bosnia Serbs "to bring together the fragments of a Bosnian peace  settlement."  Churkin accused the Muslims of being the first to  "initiate combat activities in Gorazde" despite the fact that it  was a UN "safety zone," but also faulted the Bosnian Serbs for  misleading him as to their intentions (ITAR-TASS, 11 April).     -- Ministry press spokesman Grigoriy Karasin stressed that Russia  "will never reconcile itself to the role of a so-called junior  partner, who is informed after the event about such decisions."  He said Russia was "opposed to the practice of being consulted  only to obtain a yes" (Moscow radio, 12 April).     -- Interfax (11 April) cited an unnamed "high-ranking diplomat"  as saying that Moscow's reaction to the bombardment of Serb  positions "will be tough" if it discovered that the strikes could  have been "avoided."  He complained that Russia was not a "banana  republic" and as a permanent member of the UN Security Council  would not accept being informed about decisions to use force in  Yugoslavia as a "fait accompli."  He also claimed that the  Muslims had "provoked" the Serbs' military actions in Gorazde and  that attacks on the Serbs would only "make them unwilling to  negotiate."     An 11 April Russian Foreign Ministry statement complained that  Moscow had been informed of the air strikes only "after the  event" and said Russia continued to await "full information"  about what has happened from the UN leadership.  The statement  called for the implementation of "urgent measures" around Gorazde  including the deployment of UN forces, the withdrawal of Serbs  from their present positions, and the demilitarization of the  area, including the disarmament of Muslim forces (ITAR-TASS, 11  April).     Legislature Condemns the Attack     Predictably, the Russian legislature, many of whose members have  for months been attacking the government for cooperating with the  West on Bosnia and for giving insufficient support to the Serbs,  opposed the NATO air strikes.  Leaders from across the political  spectrum voiced disapproval:     -- Yeltsin supporter and Federation Council chairman Vladimir  Shumeyko called the strikes "unjustified at this point" and  criticized the United States for openly showing support for one  side while "punishing" the other side (ITAR-TASS, 11 April).     -- Duma Speaker and Agrarian Party member Ivan Rybkin issued a  statement on behalf of the Duma demanding "an immediate end" to  NATO's "unilateral, unsanctioned use of force," complaining that  NATO has "easily ignored not only Russia's view," but also the  "achieved agreements," and that its action "threatens to ruin"  prospects for a peaceful political settlement (ITAR-TASS, 12  April).     -- Sergey Shakhray, co-chairman of the Party of Russian Unity and  Accord (PRES) charged that conducting the air strikes without  consulting Russia was a "slap in the face" to Yeltsin and would  have an adverse effect within Russia, creating, indirectly, a  "telling strike against Russian reforms" and benefitting "the  national patriots" (Moscow radio, 12 April; Nezavisimaya Gazeta,  13 April).     -- Former Ambassador to the United States Vladimir Lukin, a  member of the moderately reformist Yavlinskiy bloc and chairman  of the Duma's international affairs committee expressed  "disappointment" at the "very unfortunate, badly timed" strikes  which had occurred just when Russian diplomatic efforts were  bringing results.  He faulted the lack of "preliminary  consultations" with Russia and called for convening the UN  Security Council to determine if the attacks were in line with UN  resolutions.  While admitting that some Serb commanders "may have  been at fault," he warned that the air strikes will "unavoidably  complicate" the situation (ITAR-TASS, 12 April).     -- The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), whose leader Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy had called for the bombing of NATO bases in Italy in  retaliation, denounced the air strikes, warning of the  possibility of unleashing world war in the Balkans and stating  that the "Russian people support their Serb brothers" (ITAR-TASS,  Interfax, 11 April).     Media Reaction     The Russian media across the political spectrum expressed regret  at the air strikes, with most commentary expressing anger that  Moscow was not consulted in advance, (See box) and some warning  that NATO's actions were becoming a factor in Russia's domestic  political struggle:     -- The pro-Yeltsin newspaper Izvestiya tried to present a  balanced view, expressing strong doubts about Serbian actions,  but also warning that NATO's response would have unfavorable  consequences for Russia.  A front-page 12 April report filed from  Belgrade maintained that the NATO attack "was to be expected."  Saying that Russia had "repeatedly warned" the Bosnian Serbs, who  had been "attacking" Gorazde for "the past two weeks," of the  "danger of the situation," the article charged that the Serbs had  assured Russia that there would be no "exacerbation of the  situation," but "immediately broke their word."  Another article  the same day trenchantly observed that Belgrade only began  extolling "Slav unity" after sanctions against Serbia were  introduced and claimed that Serb diplomacy was mainly directed at  pitting Russia against the West.  A 13 April Maksim Yusin article  titled "NATO Resolve and Serb Stubbornness Put Russian Diplomacy  in Difficult Position," stressed that events are "taking a most  undesirable turn for Moscow."  Claiming that Russia had been  "winning one diplomatic victory after another" when the stress  was on negotiations, Yusin claimed that the Kremlin's ability to  influence the situation was "very limited" once NATO-Serb  hostilities began.  Yusin warned that Russia's relations with the  West "would be put to a new test" if NATO carried out more  military operations, but he nonetheless concluded that Yeltsin  "attaches too much importance" to ties to the United States and  Western Europe to "put them at risk over the Serbs'  inflexibility."     -- A 13 April article in the independent reformist newspaper  Nezavisimaya Gazeta condemned what it saw as the West's one-sided  approach favoring the Bosnian Muslims and complained that the  West is "apparently little concerned about the internal political  complications" from such actions both for the Bosnian Serbs and  in Russia.     -- A 13 April article in the mass-circulation newspaper  Komsomolskaya Pravda titled "NATO'S Order: Kill the Serbs,"  faulted the U.S foreign policy for its "insolence" in  demonstrating "unthinking support" and "clear favoritism" toward  the Muslims, claiming that the U.S. "inability to compromise" had  placed it "on a par' with the Bosnian Serbs.  The article  suggested that the air strikes were a reaction to Russia's  "surprisingly flexible and fresh" diplomatic approaches, which  had caught Washington "unawares" and charged that Washington, by  "constantly" declaring "Russia must not abandon us," has "placed  Russia in a difficult position."     -- The pro-communist newspaper Pravda predictably adopted a  shrill tone in a report titled "25 Minutes of War.  World War  III?"  In a transparent effort to invoke Slav solidarity, the  article quoted a Bosnian Serbian Orthodox priest, who, as a U.S.  F-16 "Phantom" flew overhead, said "it is NATO, not God who is  above us today" and "behaving as if it is above God."  He asked  why foreign aircraft were "roaring over Slav land," and charged  that the UN is becoming "NATO's hostage." After complaining that  the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact left no one to stop the  bombing, the article asked if the "Balkan fuse" "lit by the flame  of the Kremlin 'perestroyka'" would once again explode?     Outlook     Yeltsin and other government officials are clearly angered by  NATO's lack of consultation prior to launching airstrikes against  Bosnian Serb positions around Gorazde, in part because the use of  military force threatens to jeopardize Russia's role as a  mediator with the Serbs in negotiations, but more importantly  because this appears to indicate a continued refusal on the part  of the United States to treat Russia as an equal partner.  Apparently convinced that U.S. officials knew in advance of the  Gorazde strike, the Russians regard the lack of prior  consultation as a severe slight.  Moreover, NATO's actions give  ammunition to domestic critics of Yeltsin's policies of  cooperation with the West.     Box                     State Television Reaction     Russia's two major state-run television networks, Ostankino and  Russian Television (RTV), have run commentaries more critical of  the NATO bombings than Russian official reaction.  On 12 April  RTV's Vesti aired a commentary by G. Shakhov  which used the NATO  bombings to argue against Russian participation in the  Partnership for Peace initiative asserting that the airstrikes  call into question NATO's suitability as a partner.  Shakhov  charged that U.S. President Bill Clinton "admitted" at a White  House press conference that he had not informed Russian President  Boris Yeltsin of the imminent airstrikes that were then "in  preparation," which, according to Shakhov, created the impression  that "the United States has decided to independently determine  the fate of the peoples of Bosnia."  This occurred, according to  Shakhov, despite the fact that during the recent crisis in  Sarajevo, it was a Russian diplomatic iniative which helped to  avoid tragedy.  It was this very initiative, according to  Shakhov, which evoked the "irritation" of "certain circles" in  Washington.  As a result, these "circles" have decided to act  henceforth "without any consultations with Russia."  Shakhov  concluded by questioning Russian participation in the Partnership  for Peace initiative with a NATO which "ignores Russia's role as  a great power and openly supports one of the sides to the  [Bosnian] conflict."  * This commentary was the third in a series of recent commentaries  by Shakhov taking aim at the U.S. for unilateral foreign policy  moves in areas which Russia considers to be within its sphere of  influence.  For a discussion of the other two, see the FBIS  Trends of 6 April 1994, pages 23-25.  Ostankino's Vladimir Grigoryev began his commentary by citing an  editorial from the French newspaper, Le Monde.  According to  Grigoryev the editorial charged that NATO, which was formed as a  restraining "shield," had become a "punishing sword," and that  the airstrikes entailed a "radical change" in NATO's doctrine and  strategy.  Grigoryev then cited the Washington Post which, he  claimed, asserted that despite NATO claims that the bombings were  authorized by UN resolutions, this was a mere "pretext" for the  "widespread and massive use of military air power."  Noting  comments by the U.S. officer in charge of NATO forces in Southern  Europe to the effect that the airstrikes had destroyed three  tanks, Grigoryev questioned why he did not take into account the  "victims among the civilian population" and asserted that the  airstrikes took place just as "signs of a possible political  normalization" of the situation around Gorazde had appeared.  He  cited remarks by both Yeltsin and Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev that there had been no prior consultation with Clinton or  NATO officials and asserted that the bombing had taken place "in  violation" of previously held agreements.  He concluded by noting  a UN announcement that henceforth airstrikes could take place  without preliminary consultation with UN officials and asserted  that this statement means "nothing but a further escalation" of  the conflict.

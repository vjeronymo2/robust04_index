			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] TISHRIN speaks about the emotional speech President  Hafiz al-Asad addressed to the masses of our people, in which he  expressed thanks and gratitude for the sincere emotions they  showed on the death of Basil.    TISHRIN Says: In his speech, President Hafiz al-Asad called  for serious work in order to continue the march of construction  and liberation within the framework of deep-rooted and effective  national unity. President al-Asad said: There is a lot to be  accomplished and immense responsibility to carry out. Let us  continue our march, armed with faith in God, and let us redouble  our efforts. The people who believed in God, unified  themselves, and resolved to regain their rights will surely  regain them.    TISHRIN emphasizes that while engaged in the battle for just  and comprehensive peace, Syria should mobilize all its  capabilities and potentials, whether in the field of internal  construction or in the field of unifying the Arab position and  urging Arab brothers to rise up to a viable position, especially  since the holy Ibrahimi Mosque massacre has shown it is  impossible to speak about peace in the Middle East without  ending Israeli occupation and dismantling Zionist settlements.    The concessions offered by the Palestinian side and the  involvement of some Arabs in discussing means of regional  cooperation increased Israel's arrogance and aggressiveness.  Furthermore, Israel went as far as propagating that it is  possible to make peace in the Middle East without Syria and  Lebanon.    TISHRIN adds: Syria has repeatedly warned against deviating  from Arab consensus and the principles of the peace process.  Israel used the negotiations card with the Palestinian side in  order to evade the peace requisites on the Syrian and Lebanese  tracks. The result was a horrible massacre and more Israeli  killing, sieges, and starving. At present, the occupied  territories are subject to the ugliest forms of Zionist  terrorism.    TISHRIN says this situation requires an all-out review of  Arab policies in order to restore pan-Arab solidarity and  continue the Arab boycott of Israel, until it accepts the  principles of just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East  and returns the Golan, south Lebanon, and all occupied  territories.    TISHRIN concludes by saying: Syria, now and in the future,  will continue to be the same -- no relinquishment of a grain of  national soil or any of the nation's rights. Whether the  negotiations continue for a long or a short time, the Syrian  position will always be based on the aspirations of our Arab  people and nation to restore the territories and the shrines,  and build a shining future, away from the Israeli aggressive  threats.</p>

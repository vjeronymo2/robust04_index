			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Greenall Whitley edges up to Pounds 24.1m - Change of name is intended to reflect change of identity GREENALL WHITLEY, which intends to change its name to Greenalls Group to reflect its switch from regional brewer to national pubs and hotels operator, yesterday reported interim pre-tax profits marginally higher at Pounds 24.14m, against Pounds 23.74m. Trading profit for the six months ended March 29 1991 increased by 10 per cent to Pounds 21.25m (Pounds 19.32m) on turnover down by 7.4 per cent to Pounds 225.5m (Pounds 243.46m). Fully diluted earnings per share were unchanged at 12.6p but the interim dividend is raised to 4.4p (4p). With full provision made in last year's accounts for the brewery closures, operating profits on pubs and brewing of Pounds 19.2m were not strictly comparable with last year's Pounds 16.42m. Mr Christopher Hatton, chairman, said he expected benefits from the closures to result in a 'modest increase' over the full year. 'Trading performance in our pubs has been sustained despite the most difficult economic conditions we have experienced in recent years,' he added. Talks were being held with both national and regional brewers with a view to extending and upgrading the pub estate, which was offering a wider choice of beers to customers. Mr Andrew Thomas, managing director, said yesterday that Pounds 25m-Pounds 30m was earmarked for this upgrading. Operating profit on catering inns and restaurants of Pounds 2.18m (Pounds 1.9m) was adversely affected by a reduced level of activity in the accommodation market; but the group's off-licences weathered the economic difficulties well, raising their profit contribution to Pounds 1.45m (Pounds 1.29m). The Gulf War and recession depressed the group's hotel trade in both the UK and US. Operating profits were down from Pounds 8.35m in last year's buoyant first half to Pounds 5.88m. A 5 per cent increase in room rates helped compensate for a 6 per cent fall in occupancy. Profit at the pre-tax level was hit by a fall in the level of property disposals from Pounds 4.42m to Pounds 2.89m, but it benefited from a Pounds 1m reduction in interest charges on lower borrowings. COMMENT The trading performance of Greenall's pub estate over the half year is flattered by the treatment of the costs of closing its breweries; but the group appears to be getting off to a fair start on its chosen path as a pubs and hotels operator. Management is focused on upgrading the pub estate. Customers are already getting wider choice and margins are improving. Despite continuing economic difficulties, improvement is also expected on the hotels side from a combination of cost controls and sustained marketing. Analysts do not seem inclined to quarrel with the group's claims to have established a firm base for further progress. Full year pre-tax profits are expected to be slightly above last year's Pounds 62.23m, with earnings per share marginally down from 34.8p to 33.5p, putting the company on a prospective p/e of 10.2.</p>

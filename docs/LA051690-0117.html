			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> WALDEN WOODS NAMED ON 'ENDANGERED' LIST  </P> <P> Walden Woods, a few acres celebrated in the writings of Henry David Thoreau,  has been recognized as one of the nation's 11 most endangered historical sites.  </P> <P> The National Trust for Historic Preservation, which is supported by the federal  government, selected the site because it is threatened by encroaching  development, officials said Monday.  </P> <P> Although the designation carries no money with it and does not outlaw new  building, conservationists said it may lead to federal aid and will fuel  private preservation efforts.  </P></p>

			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / The Daf Crisis: Unions fear for future of plants UNION LEADERS last night accused the UK government of collusion in the collapse of Leyland-Daf. They fear that Leyland-Daf's plants in the UK will be sacrificed to save its production facilities in continental Europe. Mr Tony Woodley, national auto industry secretary of the TGWU general union, said he had 'reliable information' that a new company was being established with financial backing from the Dutch and Belgian governments to save the plants in continental Europe and leave the British operations 'to swing in the wind'. He said that Belgian and Dutch employees of Leyland-Daf were being told their jobs will either be safeguarded or they will receive attractive redundancy packages, thanks to the intervention of their governments. The company denied the accusation last night but Mr Woodley said that he was standing by his claim. 'The government must now surely change its indifferent attitude to the fate of the Leyland-Daf operations in Britain', added Mr Woodley. 'It must invest the resources necessary to give our workers the same chance as those in Belgium and Holland to prove they can produce world-beating trucks and vans.' Union leaders are demanding an early meeting with the receivers  - Arthur Andersen  - at Leyland-Daf to discuss ways of saving all its UK plants from permanent closure. Mr Derek Bullen, works convenor at the plant at Leyland, Lancashire, said that after meeting a representative of the receiver he 'had the feeling' that a viable plan would be brought forward to keep the plant open. 'My first impressions are that he does not appear to want to come in and shut things down,' he said. Union officials are pressing Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, to intervene to try and save the British plants. 'Heseltine invented the word intervention but he does not seem to know how to do it. He has to intervene to help or we will see thousands of lay-offs,' said Mr John Allen, a national official of the AEEU engineering and electricians' union. Mr Heseltine said yesterday the government was 'ready to work closely' with the company, the receivers, the banks and other interested parties 'to mitigate as far as possible the impact on UK jobs'. But he ruled out any loans or subsidy to keep the plants in the UK open. National officials from all four unions at Leyland-Daf are due to meet this morning to co-ordinate their response to the crisis. Some believe the Leyland truck plant  - one of the most modern in Europe  - will be saved but the rest of the UK operations will be shut down. They point to the serious knock-on effect of the liquidation of the UK plants. The TGWU estimates that at least 15,000 jobs could be lost  - with 10,000 going at suppliers  - if all Leyland-Daf plants close, saying this would cost Pounds 87m in redundancy payoffs. Workers at the Leyland plant are planning a lobby of parliament, petitions and marches to save their jobs. Mr Ian Hayes, chairman of white-collar unions at the plant, said: 'We have got to keep the pressure up. We have fought many battles before to save factories from closure. What we need now is a real awareness in the community here that we are on the brink of going under.'</p>

			<p><P> October 17, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 3 FIRMS MUST PROVIDE CANCER WARNINGS  </P> <P> Three companies have agreed to provide consumer warnings on mothballs, room  fresheners and diaper pail deodorizers that contain a chemical known to cause  cancer, the office of Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp announced Tuesday.  </P> <P> The products, which are found in an estimated 70% of homes in California,  contain the chemical paradichlorobenzene, which has been identified by the  state as a carcinogen.  </P> <P> The action against the three companies was filed under Proposition 65, the  state's anti-toxics law that requires businesses to provide a warning when  exposing members of the public to a "significant risk" of cancer.  </P> <P> The companies named in the action, Willert Home Products, Excell Products and  Sanitoy Inc., agreed to provide warnings on products that contain  paradichlorobenzene. They also agreed under the settlement to place newspaper  ads offering a refund to anyone who purchased the products without a proper  warning.  </P> <P> The attorney general identified these products as containing the cancer-causing  chemical:  </P> <P> Mothballs, mothball cakes and room deodorizers made by Willert Home Products  and sold under the names Enoz and Reefer-Galler.  </P> <P> Similar products made by Excell Products and sold under the brand name Excell.  </P> <P> Diaper pail liners made by Sanitoy and sold under the name Nursery Needs.  </P> <P> Ed Weil, a deputy attorney general who handled the case, said studies have  shown that a toilet bowl deodorizer containing paradichlorobenzene can expose  people to 300 times the amount of the chemical considered safe under  Proposition 65.  </P> <P> All three companies could have been liable for fines of up to $2,500 a day for  each illegal exposure. Under the terms of the agreement, Excell Products will  pay $27,000 but the other companies were not assessed any penalty.  </P></p>

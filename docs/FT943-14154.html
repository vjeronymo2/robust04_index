			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets: June was depressing month for European equity markets European equity markets were depressed throughout June owing to pressure on the dollar, which resulted in a 3 per cent decline in US Treasury bond prices. International investors increased their selling pressure, says Mr James Cornish of NatWest Securities, which compiled the data. Consequently, turnover in European stocks traded on Seaq International in London, as a proportion of that in continental domestic markets, rose to 16.6 per cent in June, from 16.3 per cent in May and 15.8 per cent in April. Overall, European turnover fell by 3 per cent last month from the May figure. France showed the biggest individual gain, turnover rising by some 23 per cent as the market index fell 6.4 per cent, Mr Cornish notes. Good gains were also seen in the Netherlands and Germany, with the latter seeing a rise of 9.5 per cent after a poor showing in May. Against the three month average Germany remained 10.5 per cent down. Among the month's disappointments, Switzerland eased by 17 per cent as the general index declined by 4 per cent. However, Italy was the major loser, turnover here losing 40 per cent, and the market index almost 6 per cent as sentiment began to turn sour over the new government's ability to tackle the budget deficit.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                     EUROPEAN EQUITIES TURNOVER                Monthly total in local currencies (bn)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Bourse                Mar       Apr       May      June          US                      1994      1994      1994      1994   Dollarsbn  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Belgium             83.75     69.93     73.08     71.22        2.17 France             218.68    145.17    175.15     215.7       39.50 Germany            214.73    188.00    151.07    165.42      103.91 Italy              80,380   105,964    99,228    59,404       37.51 Netherlands         33.10     25.20     21.80     26.40       14.78 Spain            1,491.24  1,160.49  1,340.00  1,308.75        9.94 Switzerland         32.02     23.93     26.12     21.63       16.16 UK                  61.14     48.57     44.27     46.32       71.49  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Volumes represent purchases and sales.

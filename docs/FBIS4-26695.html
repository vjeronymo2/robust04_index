			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Y.C. Tai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 7 (CNA) -- Taiwan's first-ever foreign  exchange [Forex] brokerage is expected to open in early July as  part of the government's efforts to build Taipei into a regional  funding center, the Central Bank of China (CBC) said Tuesday.    CBC officials said the "Taipei Forex Inc." will begin  providing broking services in foreign exchange trading and  foreign currency financing after obtaining a business license  from the Ministry of Finance.    Preparations for the brokerage's operations have been  completed, they said, adding that the Central Bank gave the  green light to the company's establishment last September.    The brokerage, formed by 21 domestic banks, three foreign  banks, and three international money brokers, was established in  line with the "guidelines for approval of foreign exchange  brokers" promulgated last August.    Domestic banks with a stake in the firm include the  International Commercial Bank of China, the United World Chinese  Commercial Bank, the Overseas Chinese Bank, and the Chinatrust  Commercial Bank, while the three foreign banks are the Dai-Ichi  Kangyo Bank, the Bank of Tokyo, and the American Express Bank.    The three international money brokerage houses are A&amp;P  of  Britain, the Amsterdam-based Harlow Butler, and the New  York-based Yagi-Euro.    The foreign exchange brokerage is a new step in the  government's financial liberalization strategy, which aims to  develop Taipei into an Asia-Pacific funding center and  eventually a regional financial hub, the officials pointed out.    The firm will have a paid-in capital of NT [New Taiwan]  $199.50 million (US$7.36 million), they added.    The officials pledged that the Central Bank will take the  initiative to forge stronger ties with financial institutions in  Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan, and other Asia-Pacific countries to  help expand the Taipei foreign exchange market.    Daily transactions on the Taipei market ranged between  US$100  million and US$200 million, while those in Japan, the United  States, and Germany amounted to tens of billions.    Meanwhile, domestic gold traders led by the state-run  Central  Trust of China (CTC) have decided to apply to the Ministry of  Finance for approval on 24-hour gold trading.    Chang Cheng, director of the CTC Trade Department, said that  if all goes well, 24-hour gold trading could begin sometime in  the next six months.    Gold dealers could focus trading in Hong Kong and Singapore  from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m., then transfer trading to European markets  from 3 p.m. to 12 p.m., and finally deal in New York trading  until 3 a.m. the next day, Chang said.    The 24-hour trading will provide both domestic and overseas  gold investors with greater access to the global gold market, he  stressed.</p>

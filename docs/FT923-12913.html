			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Brussels puts telephones plan on hold EUROPEAN Commission plans to liberalise basic telephone services will not be published until the end of September because of French sensitivity over the issue. France is due to hold its referendum on the Maastricht treaty in September, and the state-owned telecommunications company is one of the most vociferous opponents of further liberalisation. The Commission yesterday approved directives which would lay the groundwork for greater competition, by harmonising technical and quality standards, and granting third parties access to telephone networks. Brussels also published a paper criticising the excessive cost of cross-border calls. But the Commission withdrew a policy paper laying out how it would open up cross-border calls to competition. Mr Filippo Maria Pandolfi, the research and telecommunications commissioner said thereview would be delayed until September 30.</p>

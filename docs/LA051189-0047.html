			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON INDEPENDENCE DAY, SHAMIR CITES ARABS' HATRED OF ISRAEL  </P> <P> Israel on its 41st anniversary still faces hate-crazed violence from Arabs who  refuse to accept its existence, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Two Palestinians were killed and at least 13 others were wounded in scattered  confrontations in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip despite harsh measures  imposed on Independence Day, according to Arab reports.  </P> <P> Throughout the day, the military maintained curfews on roughly 1 million  Palestinians, including the entire Gaza Strip, and prohibited West Bank  Palestinians from entering Israel in an effort to prevent violence.  </P> <P> Israelis jammed parks celebrating their national holiday with picnics and  barbecues after a night of revelry, street festivals and fireworks. In  Jerusalem, President Chaim Herzog hosted the foreign diplomatic corps, and  Mayor Teddy Kollek held a reception at the newly opened Citadel museum near the  walled Old City's Jaffa Gate.  </P> <P> In interviews aired on Israel Radio, Shamir said the Israeli army is handling  the 17-month-old Palestinian uprising with courage and integrity but at the  moment "without complete success."  </P> <P> "Israel is under many pressures and threats especially related to her  security," Shamir said. "I would say to ourselves -- 'Let's keep things in  proportion.'  </P> <P> "The truth which we have to see and come to terms with is that the Arabs have  not yet reconciled themselves to our existence and our independence. The  expression of this is the violence and the insane hatred we have to stand up  against," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Shamir Hospitalized  </P> <P> Shamir's comments were made in interviews recorded before he was hospitalized  Wednesday afternoon for medical tests at Jerusalem's Hadassah Hospital. Shamir,  73, struck his head in a fall at his home Tuesday night and later complained of  discomfort, an aide said.  </P> <P> "He felt weakness a little bit, and his doctors decided he should be  hospitalized for checks," the aide said. "There appears to be nothing serious."  </P> <P> Shamir aides said they expect him to be released by Friday. A hospital  spokeswoman said the prime minister was resting comfortably, receiving guests  and working in his room.  </P></p>

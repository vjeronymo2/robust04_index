			<p><P> September 12, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> UNISYS CORP.'S TIMEPLEX WILL BUY OUT DOELZ  </P> <P> To boost its technological prowess in creating high-speed data transfer  networks, Timeplex, a subsidiary of computer maker Unisys Corp., said Tuesday  that it has agreed to acquire the assets of Doelz Inc.  </P> <P> Terms of the deal, which is subject to approval of shareholders of Irvine-based  Doelz, were not disclosed.  </P> <P> Doelz, which employs 60 workers, will be integrated into Timeplex, a  manufacturer of high-speed data communications network equipment based in  Woodcliff Lake, N.J. Company officials said no layoffs are expected.  </P> <P> Doelz produces so-called wide-area networks that allow computers and other  office equipment to communicate over telephone lines between distant sites.  </P> <P> Timeplex, which has sales in excess of $200 million, said in a statement that  it will support Doelz's current line of packet-switching products. The switches  can burst packets of data over a communications network quickly and  efficiently.  </P> <P> The two companies have had a relationship since 1987, when Timeplex was  acquired by Unisys.  </P> <P> "In the last two to three years, approximately 60% of Doelz's current  production has been distributed by Unisys," said Dewaine L. Osman, president of  Timeplex and the Unisys Communications &amp; Networks group.  </P> <P> Melvin Doelz said the sale would enable the company to better explore new  technologies. "To some extent you like to run your own show, but on the other  hand Timeplex has a lot more resources to do more interesting things," he said.  </P> <P> The engineering portion of Doelz will remain in Irvine and be known as the  Doelz Technical Center. Doelz, 71, will be Timeplex's chief scientist.  </P> <P> Doelz founded the company in 1979 and 10 years later led a group of European  investors in a buyout of the firm -- then known as Doelz Networks Inc. -- for  an undisclosed sum. At the time, Doelz officials said revenues were in the  $10-million to $20-million range.  </P></p>

			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Government Bonds: Long-dated Treasuries weaken on housing data LONGER-dated US Treasury bonds moved sharply lower at midday yesterday in a market made nervous by stronger-than-expected December housing starts. US housing starts rose 2.6 per cent in December to a 1.1m annual rate, while building permits rose 5.8 per cent to 1.05m, slightly higher than the 1.09m widely expected. But the gains were offset by news that total housing starts for the year showed their lowest reading since 1945. The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond lost ground in the early afternoon, ahead of the two-year note auction, and remained depressed through the rest of the day. In late trading, the issue was  21/32 lower at 104 5/16 , yielding 7.63 per cent. The declines were less dramatic at the short end of the yield curve, where notes were quoted about  1/8 lower in late trading. The Federal Reserve entered the market to arrange overnight system repurchase agreements when Fed funds were trading at 4 7/16 per cent. There was no policy meaning attached to the Fed's action. With Fed funds trading above the perceived target of 4 per cent for the rate, economists had expected the Fed's intervention, which adds reserves to the system. Prices started to recover after the Dollars 13.75bn two-year note auction, which saw reasonably strong demand and had an average yield of 4.99 per cent. The Treasury will sell Dollars 9.25bn of five-year notes today. JAPANESE government bonds climbed to new highs boosted by a sharp fall in short-term interest rates. The Bank of Japan made a larger-than-expected addition of funds to the money market yesterday, prompting the rate on three-month certificates of deposit to fall as low as 4.94 per cent, from 5.20 per cent. The Bank of Japan's addition of funds to the money market was seen as an effort to buoy the Tokyo stock market, and led to speculation that the central bank may cut the official discount rate soon. The benchmark No 129 which opened at 5.275 per cent, reached a record high to yield 5.17 per cent at the close of trading. Strong demand for short and medium-dated securities led to a steepening in the yield curve. However, prices slipped back in London trading as some bond investors took profits, encouraged by the strength of the yen against the dollar. WORRIES about possible strike action wiped out early gains in the German government bond market yesterday, with the market closing lower on the day. Talks between German steelworkers and employers broke down early on Wednesday morning, with the result that a strike vote will be taken by the steelworkers' union this Sunday. Separate talks in the German banking sector broke down yesterday after the union rejected a 5 per cent pay offer. The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 88.54 and reached a high of 88.78, a technical resistance level, before falling back to 88.36 in reasonable volumes. Elsewhere in Europe, the Dutch government's financing agency raised a further Fl 3.4bn from sales of its tap issues. The agency has sold a total of Fl 12.2bn this week of the two tap issues - the 8.25 per cent bond due 2002 and the 8.25 per cent bond due 2007. Traders reported some switching out of German bunds into Dutch bonds to take advantage of the 50 basis point yield spread. LONG-DATED UK government bond prices slipped back following the German market, while shorter maturities were mainly unchanged on the day. The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 fell from its opening of 115 5/8 to 115 1/2 by late afternoon.</p>

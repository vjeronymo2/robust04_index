			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / UK Company News: Parambe down sharply at Pounds 40,000 Parambe, which deals in securities and works of art, reported a sharp fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 113,624 to Pounds 39,941 in 1993. Dealing income from works of art dropped substantially to Pounds 5,850 (Pounds 169,758). Investment income was also down at Pounds 62,933 (Pounds 73,226) while security dealing jumped from Pounds 42,194 to Pounds 111,870. Earnings per share fell to 0.46p (1.27p) and the proposed final dividend is held at 0.55p for a 1.1p total. Net asset value amounted to 77.9p (60.8p) per share. The directors said they were concerned that in recent years the company's share price had consistently represented a substantial discount to net asset value. Accordingly, a resolution would be put to shareholders on or before December 31 2000 for a members' voluntary liquidation involving a distribution to shareholders following realisation. That decision was subject to any change in circumstances or alternative proposal being received, they said.</p>

			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / UK urges Iraq to free jailed Briton BRITAIN yesterday demanded that Iraq release Mr Paul Steven Ride, after it was learnt that the 33-year-old Briton had been sentenced to seven years' jail for illegally crossing the border from Kuwait, Reuter reports. His sentencing adds to tension between Britain and Iraq, already heightened by the British government decision on Tuesday to send warplanes to the Gulf to help bar Iraqi jets from a planned 'no-fly' zone in southern Iraq. Mr Ride, who was working in Kuwait for the British catering company, Taylor International, disappeared on June 28 after he left his office in al-Jahrah, west of Kuwait city. The Foreign Office said it had learnt - through the Russian embassy in Baghdad - that he had been sentenced by a Baghdad court. He was to be taken to the prison on the outskirts of Baghdad where another Briton, Mr Ian Richter, had been held until his release last November, after serving five years on bribery charges. The sentence was 'totally disproportionate to the alleged offence,' the Foreign Office said. 'This is yet another example of the lengths to which the government of Iraq will go to exploit innocent civilians in blatant disregard of their human rights or any internationally accepted standard of behaviour.' The Foreign Office said it would 'use all means at our disposal, all pressure we can bring to bear' to obtain Mr Ride's 'prompt release'. Britain has no diplomatic presence in Baghdad as relations were broken off in February last year at the start of the Gulf war. It has protested about the sentencing to the head of the Iraqi interest section at the Jordanian embassy in London. Diplomats in Baghdad had expected that Mr Ride would be expelled and had not predicted a jail term. They believe Mr Ride became lost in the desert and accidentally drove across the border before being arrested by Iraqi security men, although they were puzzled how he got through military checkpoints and minefields. Mr Ride was visited by the International Committee of the Red Cross last Saturday and the Russian embassy has been seeking a permit to visit him. His wife and their 15-month-old son live in north London.</p>

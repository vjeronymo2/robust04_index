			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> PORT OF LOS ANGELES SEEKS EXEMPTION TO NEW PARKING TAX  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council last week tentatively agreed that the city's new  parking tax should not apply to any of the huge lots in the harbor where about  250,000 cars each year are stored and processed for sale after their arrival at  the port.  </P> <P> The exemption is being sought by Port of Los Angeles officials who fear that  the tax might drive away the harbor's seven auto storage and processing  companies. In all, the tax would cost the firms $250,000 to $500,000 each year.  </P> <P> The city's new tax, devised by Mayor Tom Bradley, took effect in August and  adds a 10% surcharge to parking in the city. The levy is expected to generate  about $30 million annually, according to city budget analysts.  </P> <P> If the council decides against the exemption and any companies decide to leave,  their business would be welcome in other harbors such as Port Hueneme and San  Diego, officials there said.  </P> <P> City lawmakers already have modified the tax once, to exclude apartment  buildings. The council last week moved toward an exemption for the port  businesses, arguing they were never meant to be included in the new levy. A  final vote on the waiver is expected in several weeks.  </P> <P> The exemption, proposed Wednesday by Harbor-area Councilwoman Joan Milke  Flores, would not affect the city's revenue estimates from the parking tax  because the businesses were not specifically included in the original study of  the tax, city officials said.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, officials said, at least one of the companies that stores and  processes new cars on 270 acres in the port recently received a tax assessment  on parking from the Los Angeles city clerk's office. That surcharge led the  Harbor Department and Flores to push for the exemption.  </P> <P> In a motion that was approved without discussion, Flores argued that the  council had approved the new parking tax with the understanding that it would  only apply to commercial parking lots, such as those in business districts.  </P> <P> Applying the tax to the port businesses, Flores told her colleagues, was not  only unintended but could lead the companies to leave the harbor, jeopardizing  hundreds of jobs and a significant part of the port's annual income.  </P> <P> The concern, port officials added, is that the tax could hurt the Harbor  Department in its competition with other West Coast ports that vie for auto  shipments -- a business that generates an estimated $6 million to $7 million  annually for the Port of Los Angeles in land leases and wharfage fees.  </P> <P> Though the Port of Los Angeles accounts for about 25% of all West Coast  shipments of autos, port officials said the market has become increasingly  competitive in recent years. That competition, they said, is evident from auto  shipments to Port Hueneme and San Diego, which recently opened its first auto  storage yard. And the competition extends to the Pacific Northwest, where at  least one port has offered free land just to collect the wharfage fees on new  autos passing through the port.  </P> <P> "The tax would hurt us. It would be a problem," claimed Michael Lemke, property  manager for the Port of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The specific exemption voted Wednesday would amend the city's parking tax law  to exclude auto service companies preparing unregistered cars for sale or  export.  </P> <P> Before the proposed amendment returns for final action by the council and  mayor, it is also expected to be reviewed by the city administrative office,  where one analyst said Wednesday that the exemption for the auto storage  companies is essentially a policy decision for the council.  </P> <P> Officials at other ports saw Los Angeles' tax as an opportunity.  </P> <P> "I hope the parking tax discourages people from using Los Angeles," said Port  Hueneme's Deputy Executive Director Bill Buenger. "I don't know that it has or  that it will, but I hope it does."  </P> <P> While his harbor now accommodates only two storage yards for new cars, Buenger  said Port Hueneme has plenty of space for additional business if it comes.  "We've got acres of farmland around here, and that land could easily be  converted," he said.  </P></p>

			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Domestic woes offset by fall in bond yields Wall Street US SHARE prices ended slightly higher yesterday after a sharp fall in long-term bond yields helped to offset an unexpectedly large rise in weekly unemployment insurance claims and worries about the political outlook, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 12.43 firmer at 3,290.04. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 1.15 to 412.08, while the Nasdaq composite improved 1.36 to 565.24. Turnover on the New York SE amounted to 181m shares. The announcement from the Labor department of a 19,000 rise in state unemployment insurance claims during the week ending July 11 was an early blow to sentiment as the market had been anticipating only a small increase in claims. Rumours that Mr Dan Quayle, the vice-president, may be replaced to boost President George Bush's re-election chances heightened political uncertainties and added to the market's gloom. However, a fall in long-term bond yields, prompted by the jobless claims data and talk of the Treasury reducing the size of its bond issues, provided support for stocks later in the day. Salomon climbed more than Dollars 1 in early trading before finishing a net Dollars  3/4 up at Dollars 36 3/8 , after the securities group reported strong second quarter profits in spite of a Dollars 185m charge taken to cover some of the costs relating to the settlement of last year's bond trading scandal and any subsequent lawsuits. Delta fell Dollars 1 1/4 in the morning after the airline reported a Dollars 180.2m loss for the second quarter, compared to the modest profit earned in the year-ago period. But buyers soon flocked to the stock, which ended down just Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 53 1/4 . Airline earnings this past quarter have been hit hard by the recent price war among domestic carriers. Other big airline stocks were also easier. Walt Disney eased Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 35 1/2 in spite of a solid rise in fiscal third quarter earnings to 41 cents a share. The company warned, however, that its recently opened Euro Disney unit in France would post a loss for this year. On the Nasdaq market, Au Bon Pain fell Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 14 1/2 after Morgan Stanley dropped the franchise bakery and cafe group's stock from its emerging growth focus list. Canada TORONTO shares closed steady in moderate trading. The TSE 300 index rose only 0.14 to 3,412.2, while declines led advances by 268 to 251. Volume of 34.1m was bloated by 9.2m Torstar 'B' shares, sold by an underwriting group which had purchased them from Southam Inc.</p>

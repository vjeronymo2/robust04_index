For the fiscal year ended December 31, 1992, and the six months ended June 30, 1993, the Affected Portfolios' expenses were as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 3,L2,tp0,i1,s10,6,6 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> &blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Type of expense <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Percent of average net assets <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 2World income  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 2Gov't securities <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Fiscal Year 1992: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=02 g=1 f=1 --> Investment Advisory Fee  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 0.60  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 0.50 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other Expenses  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 0.16  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 0.02 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0162 intable --> n,s <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=03 g=1 f=1 --> Total Expenses  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 0.76  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 0.52 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=22 g=1 f=1 --> Six Months Ended June 30, 1993:1 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=02 g=1 f=1 --> Investment Advisory Fee  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 0.60  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 0.50 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other Expenses  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 0.28  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 0.02 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0162 intable --> n,s <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=03 g=1 f=1 --> Total Expenses  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 0.88  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 0.52 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0146 intable --> 1Annualized <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Contractual provisions limiting fees and expenses to be paid under certain Equitable Variable Contracts existed when Equitable Variable reorganized its separate accounts into unit investment trust form. Consequently, Equitable Variable agreed to reimburse certain Divisions which invest in the Hudson Trust for the portion of advisory fees and other Trust expenses that exceed the contractual limits set forth in these Contracts. These reimbursements are made by Equitable Variable to such Divisions only in respect of owners of Equitable Variable Contracts that contain such contractual expense limits. Expenses of owners of Equitable Variable Contracts that do not contain any such contractual limits are not affected by the reimbursements. Because the reimbursements are prescribed by the relevant Contracts, Equitable Variable's contractual reimbursement obligations will not be altered by the proposed Substitution. The expenses of the Portfolios shown in the foregoing table are, therefore, not affected by these reimbursements. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The application will be amended during the notice period to reflect this representation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 8. The yields for the 30-day period ending August 21, 1993 were 4.79% for the World Income Portfolio and 5.80% for the Government Securities Portfolio.

The Hudson Trust's Board of Trustees and Equitable have determined that it is in the best interests of the shareholders of the World Income Portfolio, and the Contractowners who have allocated premiums to the World Income Divisions, to suspend operations of that Portfolio and the corresponding Divisions for the following reasons. The World Income Portfolio's expenses, as noted above, are relatively high. Assets are small and declining from approximately $11.3 million on June 30, 1992 to approximately $10.4 million on June 30, 1993, even though Equitable Variable has maintained its seed money investment of $5 million ($5.1 million as of June 30, 1993). Additionally, the World Income Portfolio currently is in net redemption and, consequently, making its investment objective more difficult to achieve. This Portfolio's performance relative to portfolios with similar investment objectives and investments has been below the median, with a recent ranking of eighth of eight world income funds for the one year period ended June 30, 1993. The proposed Substitution will, therefore, eliminate a Hudson Trust Portfolio that, because of its small size, is expected to be unable to reduce its operating expenses in the foreseeable future, that has not historically been able to produce competitive yields and returns, and that, because of those expenses and net redemptions, is expected to find it increasingly difficult to achieve competitive investment results. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. Equitable Variable thus proposes to substitute shares of the Government Securities Portfolio for shares of the World Income Portfolio. The Separate Accounts will redeem, partly for cash and partly for securities as a redemption in-kind, all shares of the World Income Portfolio attributable to Contractowners at the close of business on the date selected for the Substitution. Redemptions in-kind of securities held by the World Income Portfolio will be executed to the extent that the securities have characteristics consistent with the investment objectives and diversification requirements of the Government Securities Portfolio. Equitable Variable will request Alliance to review such securities selected for redemption in-kind to assure that such securities are suitable investments for the Government Securities Portfolio. Applicants have determined that effecting redemption of shares of the World Income Portfolio and the purchase of shares of the Government Securities Portfolio partially in cash and partially for securities is appropriate, based on the overlap between the U.S. dollar-denominated portfolio securities of the World Income Portfolio and the shorter-term securities eligible for purchase by the Government Securities Portfolio. Securities redeemed in-kind will be valued in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices and all applicable laws and regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Secretary Manuel Tello said yesterday Latin  America could face a trade deficit with Europe--the first time  in 30 years--if Europe does not clear certain "confusions that  could lead to a type of protectionism."    During opening ceremonies of the 10th San Jose Mechanism  Ministers Meeting in Athens, Greece, Tello demanded the European  nations broaden their new preference system for Latin America in  order to improve trade relations between the two regions.    Tello told the foreign ministers of Europe and the Group of  Three [G-3] (Mexico, Colombia, and Venezuela) that Latin America  has become one of the most dynamic markets for European exports  over the last three years.    Latin America's entry into that process, he added, is based  on an open regional strategy, and the economic reforms taking  place on the continent have contributed significantly to the  process of worldwide trade liberalization.    Exports from Latin America to Europe have declined since  1989, and, if this trend continues, we will be faced with a  rather high deficit for the first time in three decades.    He believes the European Union [EU] should establish a new  system of general preferences that are effective for longer  periods.    He added that the new system should eliminate any type of  "confusion" regarding health matters that might suggest some  form of protectionism.    According to the official, exports coming from the EU into  the region have increased by about 33 percent, totaling  approximately $20 billion.    He announced the G-3 will sign a free trade agreement in  1994, while integration efforts in Latin America could conclude  by 1997.    At the meeting, attended by representatives from Guatemala,  Honduras, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Panama, the EU,  and the G-3, Mexico suggested action be taken to allow Central  America greater access to the global scene.</p>

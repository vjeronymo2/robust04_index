			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Vienna, April 30 (AFP) -- North Korea has  rejected conditions set by the International Atomic Energy  Agency [IAEA] for new inspections of its nuclear sites, the IAEA  said Friday [29 April].    "The new reply from Pyongyang to our demands, which arrived  in Vienna Friday afternoon, is unsatisfactory," said IAEA  spokesman Hans-Friedrich Meyer, adding that inspectors would not  therefore travel to North Korea this weekend.    "We will discuss the situation again with the member states  at the start of next week," he said. [passage omitted]</p>

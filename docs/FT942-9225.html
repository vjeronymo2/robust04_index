			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / BAT pays Dollars 200m for majority stake in Uzbeki tobacco industry BAT Industries, the UK cigarette and insurance giant, is to take a majority stake in the state-owned tobacco industry of the former Soviet republic of Uzbekistan. The agreement, under which BAT will invest Dollars 200m (Pounds 133m) during the next five years, represents the first large foreign investment in the central Asian republic since the government announced its economic reform programme in January. The deal mirrors that struck by BAT's US rival Philip Morris in neighbouring Kazakhstan last year. Both cover support for local tobacco farmers as well as investment in processing and manufacturing plants. 'We won't actually own the land on which the tobacco is grown but we will provide advisory services to farmers,' said BAT. It believes that Uzbekistan is the more attractive of the two republics with a slightly bigger market, about 25bn cigarettes a year, and much higher tobacco production. The state factories are currently supplying less than 4bn cigarettes a year with the balance met largely by imports from other former Soviet republics. BAT said the priority was to increase the quantity and quality of Uzbek-made cigarettes rather than build brands. It hopes eventually to introduce its own international brands at the top of the market. BAT also saw an export opportunity for Uzbeki tobacco leaf. 'We believe we could get it to a grade that is acceptable on the international tobacco market,' it said. The 'oriental' tobacco grown in central Asia is used in blended American cigarettes such as BAT's Lucky Strike. Uzbekistan has lagged behind Kazakhstan in economic liberalisation, and western investors remain slightly sceptical about its economic reform programme. The government has recently sought a support agreement with the International Monetary Fund for its currency, the som, which it hopes will reassure international investors and bankers that it is serious about reform. BAT expects to start generating profits from Uzbekistan within two to three years, although it would not start taking out dividends for about five years. It plans to invest Dollars 50m over the next two years to refurbish the existing tobacco factory in Tashkent and Dollars 140m to build a new factory in Samarkand. The Uzbeki investment is by far the largest in the former eastern bloc by BAT, which has joint ventures in Hungary and Ukraine.</p>

			<p><P> April 11, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> GROUP TRIES TO PUT A DAMPER ON SPECULATION IN SIERRACIN  </P> <P> A group led by Sierracin Corp. Chairman Christoph Tribull recently said it  might make an offer to buy the 50% of the Sylmar aerospace-parts concern it  does not already own. But the group did not propose a price it might pay.  </P> <P> That left Wall Street to guess, and the guessing game that ensued sent  Sierracin's stock soaring in heavy trading.  </P> <P> Last week alone, the stock surged $4.625 a share, or 61%, to $12.25 a share on  average daily volume of 26,900 shares, about 10 times the stock's daily average  during March. Only two months ago, the stock sold for $6 a share.  </P> <P> So on Monday, as the stock continued climbing on the American Stock Exchange,  the Tribull group tried to throw cold water on the price speculation. It  announced that if it makes an offer, it "is considering" a price of $15 a  share, or $25.5 million. The group also reiterated that there is no guarantee  it will make a bid.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bidding Continued  </P> <P> Wall Street apparently has little doubt that a deal is coming, although it  remains to be seen whether the group's announcement keeps a lid on the stock's  market price. After the announcement Monday, investors continued to bid up the  stock. It gained $1.75 a share on the day to close at $14 a share, with trading  again heavy at 34,500 shares.  </P> <P> Why indicate a price if no formal offer was ready? Tribull and other Sierracin  executives referred all questions to an outside public-relations spokesman, who  said the group feared "that people have an exaggerated notion of what's going  to be paid, so they felt compelled to get the price out."  </P> <P> "They wanted to see the record set straight before the price got out of hand,"  the spokesman said.  </P> <P> With nearly half of its shares held by management, Sierracin's stock normally  is thinly traded. And for that reason, Sierracin is paid little heed by Wall  Street analysts or institutional investors.  </P> <P> Besides Tribull, who owns 44% of Sierracin, the group studying a takeover  includes Asahi Glass Co. of Japan, which holds 6% of the company. Sierracin,  which makes aircraft windows, motors, coatings and seals, earned $3.11 million  last year on sales of $82.7 million.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Stockholders' Suit  </P> <P> Tribull and other members of the group have declined comment on why they are  considering a bid. But they have said an offer would be conditioned on whatever  terms Sierracin reaches in settling a stockholders' lawsuit that was filed in  July, 1987.  </P> <P> The suit, filed by Herbert and Euretta Hastings, who own about 7.4% of  Sierracin, accused Tribull and other company officers of fraud, mismanagement  and use of corporate assets for personal benefit. The Hastings wanted Tribull  ousted and a court-appointed receiver to manage Sierracin. Tribull and the  other defendants denied any wrongdoing.  </P> <P> At the same time, Sierracin asserted that the Hastings had threatened legal  action if the company did not buy their Sierracin stock for $17.14 a share, or  $4.25 million. The Hastings denied that charge, saying Sierracin was trying to  divert attention from the Hastings' suit.  </P> <P> As of Monday, no settlement had been reached with the Hastings, the Sierracin  spokesman said. In addition, Sierracin noted that any settlement -- and  subsequent takeover bid -- will be subject to court approval.  </P></p>

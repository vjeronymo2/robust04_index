			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Observer: Rate of return When Dugald Eadie stepped down as chairman of investment performance consultancy WM Company in May, he professes to have been taken aback by the flood of calls he received from fund managers eager to engage his services. After years of scrutinising all that performance data, he was certainly in an unusually good position to pick his new stable. So what precisely made him take the call from Colin Day who chairs Henderson Pension Fund Management? Henderson is something of a fallen star in the industry, but Eadie says he took to the idea of running HPFM for the highly non-technical reason that he finds them such a congenial bunch of people. The man who started off as a computer manager in stock broker Wood Mackenzie's back office adds that he hopes he has identified what he terms 'a recovery situation'. Yesterday the gamekeeper turned poacher was faxing WM's 40 top clients apologising for his re-emergence as one of their competitors. 'There is a lot of secrecy surrounding performance in the industry,' he told Observer. 'I may be able to help.' You bet . . .</p>

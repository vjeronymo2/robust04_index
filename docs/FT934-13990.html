			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / International Company News: Schneider chief denies investigation claims MR DIDIER Pineau-Valencienne, president of Schneider, yesterday claimed that recent allegations of fraud from the authorities and minority shareholders in Belgium had been 'intentionally' timed to disrupt the French engineering and construction group's forthcoming FFr3bn (Dollars 531m) rights issue. The issue, whose details have yet to be announced, would allow Schneider to reduce its debt-to-equity ratio to below 1:1, from 1.7:1 last year, the group president said. He also confirmed that Schneider was still ready to give Daimler-Benz, the owner of AEG, a stake in its capital. However, recent discussions 'had run up against the fact that we have considerable difficulty in finding a formula which would protect our mutual interests'. Earlier this month, the Belgian justice authorities announced the opening of a fraud investigation against Mr Pineau-Valencienne. In an interview with Les Echos, the French business daily, he responded to claims that the investigation covered allegations of money-laundering by a company called PB Finance, in which Cofibel, a Schneider subsidiary, has a stake. 'To the best of our knowledge, there is not the slightest mechanism in the structure of PB Finance, as in our industrial activities in Belgium, which would allow any laundering of any kind,' he told Les Echos. 'I would add that money was rather burnt than laundered, because PB Finance lost a lot of cash.' Mr Pineau-Valencienne said although he was president of Cofibel, it was the company's late Belgian administrator who had persuaded him to take a minority stake in PB Finance, controlled by Mr Valentino Foti, an Italian businessman. Belgian minority shareholders of Cofibel and another Schneider subsidiary, Cofimines, had complained about Schneider's bid to buy them out. Schneider, however, was offering 50 per cent above the market price, Mr Pineau-Valencienne said.</p>

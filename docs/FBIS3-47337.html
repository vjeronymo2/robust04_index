Comments by people who knew him follow.    "Among the successive vice ministers, he was extraordinarily  skillful at making a connection with the Liberal Democratic  Party [LDP]."    "He was skillful at making allies of the politicians, when  there were inter-ministerial power struggles."    The factional wrangling within the ministry surrounding this  Mr. Tanahashi seems to have cast a shadow on the incident in  which MITI Minister Hiroshi Kumagai advised Industrial Policy  Bureau Director Masahisa Naito (55) to resign on grounds of the  "spoils system."    The struggle between the "Tanahashi faction" and the  "anti-Tanahashi faction" is said to have intensified over the  last three or four years.    In July 1993, copies of a mysterious document, claiming to  be  signed by "all concerned junior officers in MITI" and  criticizing Mr. Tanahashi were sent to current senior officials  and to "OB's" [former officials] and were printed in some of the  weekly magazines.    There was also past factional wrangling in MITI in 1963,  during the time of the Ikeda cabinet, surrounding selection of a  successor for Mr. Shigeru Saji (now deceased) who was then  called "Mr. MITI." Mr. Nobuyoshi Namiki, an economist who  retired as a result of his involvement in that struggle and who  wrote The End of MITI, comments:    "Since about that time, the office's power had been  decreasing, and we were losing work. The senior officials  seemed to be spending their energy on the factional fight and to  be less concerned about the work itself. Such an atmosphere  prepared the ground for the current incident."    There are even rumors that some senior officials, until  recently, formed a "club of people who live along the Toyoko  [Railroad] Line up to XX Station," a "MITI Ladies Club," and had  meetings with those subordinate officials who participated.    There are people concerned who unhappily say:    "During the Sahashi period, there was still some semblance  of  policy argument. Today, it is just a personnel struggle."  <H5>  Promoted the Eldest Son Seven Years Early </H5>   The favoritism in personnel affairs which became an issue  developed during the time Mr. Tanahashi was vice minister. They  transferred Tanahashi's eldest son, Yasufumi (30), who entered  MITI in 1987 while his father was director of the Secretariat,  from deputy head of section to a newly created position of  planning advisor in the minister's Secretariat in December 1992.    This [promotion] was said to have been seven years earlier  than [promotions] for people who entered the ministry the same  year as he.    Yasufumi [Tanahashi] resigned a week later, in January 1993,  ran in the July general election from the first district for the  House of Representative in Gifu Prefecture, and lost. His  father, who retired from MITI, stuck closely by his only son and  campaigned during the election.    The father of Mrs. Yuji [Tanahashi] is Koko Matsuno,  [former]  representative from the first district of Gifu and former  director general of the National Land Agency. At one time it  was rumored that Mr. Tanahashi himself might eventually try for  political office.    Bureau Director General Naito was, during the time of  Tanahashi's vice ministership, the chief of the Secretariat. He  supported the vice minister and was accused of playing a part in  the favoritism in personnel affairs. He was urged to resign by  the minister on 16 December and submitted his resignation on the  22d. The director of industrial policy is at the head of the  list of director generals, and was the candidate most likely to  become the next vice minister.    Mr. Naito was thought to be close to Mr. Tanahashi. But Mr.  Kozo Watanabe, who is the alternate representative secretary for  Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], the party to which MITI  Minister Kumagai also belongs, and who is himself a former MITI  minister, comments:    "He kept his distance from politicians and served earnestly,  regardless of who his superior was. He was a bureaucrat-like  bureaucrat."  <H5>  Cabinet Minister Exercises Authority and Causes Commotion </H5>   Cabinet ministers have the right to appoint and dismiss  bureaucrats. It is legal and justifiable for a cabinet officer  to dismiss a director general based on his own judgment. But  when this incident was reported, there was a great commotion in  Kasumigaseki [government sector of Tokyo].    That is because the fact that a cabinet minister would  [actually] exercise his authority and would regard pre-election  favoritism in personnel affairs as inappropriate was all  contrary to "custom in Kasumigaseki."    Director Naito himself continued to resist [dismissal] for  nearly one week, saying: "Why do I have to resign (only for such  a minor matter)?" When Mr. Naito's post-resignation press  conference was aired, in a certain office in the ministry young  staff members shouted loudly "what is this minister thinking  of?" "We just cannot have the whims of a new minister, who does  not know anything, influence our personnel."    Mr. Watanabe himself once tried to make up a personnel  chart while he was MITI minister.    The personnel proposals subsequently brought to him by the  [administrative] vice minister and chief of secretariat matched  99 percent with those Mr. Watanabe had devised.    He takes an affirmative view of the custom, saying: "It is  the bureaucrats' wisdom gained from long experience that catches  the minister's feeling and the [LDP] party's atmosphere through  day-to-day contact, so they can come up with appropriate  personnel. It is not that the ministers are controlled by the  bureaucrats."    Mr. Kumagai is a former MITI official. He gave the notice to  Mr. Naito, who entered the ministry three years ahead of him,  with language along the lines of: "I am dismissing you according  to the new cabinet's policy." He was saying that he wanted to  correct bad practices such as favoritism in personnel which had  been normal during the LDP era.    He stressed during the [news] conference that "(favoritism  in  personnel matters) is inappropriate when one looks at it with  general common sense."    Many of the concerned MITI officials agreed that a number of  similar personnel actions occurred in the past, and very few  questioned such a "practice."    "That much should be permissible for people who run for  elective office, as a gift from MITI" (former official). "They  quit immediately after receiving the promotion, so there was no  real harm" (former official).    Mr. Naito too did not conceal his resentment at the news  conference, saying: "It is as if I am being executed for a minor  offense."    For the past week, some volunteer former MITI officials  filed  into the administrative vice minister's office and pressed the  vice minister to refuse the minister's demand. Senior officials  still in service sent an open letter of questions to the  minister. The commotion expanded.  <H5>  Glory Is Declining and.... </H5>   People in the United States Trade Representative's Office  (USTR) called Japan's MITI the "notorious MITI." This was in  the latter half of the 1970's.    It was a nickname given with grudges, but also with some  wonder. MITI was the locomotive for Japanese industry which,  while creating friction with other countries, had built up a  trade surplus. Prior to that, Japan was also called an  "economic animal," "Japan, Inc."    The world thought that all the secrets for achieving that  surprising economic growth were possessed by MITI.    MITI was formerly the Ministry of Agriculture and Industry  during the Meiji period. In 1925, it became the Ministry of  Commerce and Industry and for a time during the war was called  the Ministry of Munitions. After the war, it was reborn as the  Ministry of Commerce and Industry. In 1949 it became the  Ministry of International Trade and Industry and supported the  Japanese prosperity which followed. The share of the national  budget it receives is only 1 percent. Pride that "this is a  place to work on a national vision, not a bureaucratic office to  administer subsidies" is said to lead to the staff's sense of  elitism.    One former official reminisced: "I was embarrassed because  people overrated us, believing that if MITI gave its OK, then  everything was decided."    But as the nation has entered a period of stable growth, the  current of trade has begun to flow toward liberalization and  deregulation, and their glory has begun to wane.    Now the people concerned are at a loss: "The key phrase is a  people-oriented country. What is the role for MITI, which has  single-mindedly pursued production? While the organization has  expanded, the work keeps decreasing."    Mr. Watanabe can not forget the voices of admiration, and  the  eager looks he received in meeting halls every time he was  introduced as the "MITI minister" at parties or when he visited  Asian countries while he was the MITI minister.    "For a while there was a trend that the industries which had  been nurtured by MITI became independent and said that they no  longer needed MITI. But now, in this time of recession, MITI is  again needed. At the very time, such an incident occurred...."    As he reads the newspaper he says he feels like crying.</p>

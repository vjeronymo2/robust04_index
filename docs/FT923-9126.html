			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / S Africa protest winding down SOUTH AFRICA'S week of protest, to force an early transition to majority rule, appeared to be winding down yesterday. Marches and sit-ins continued in several cities and towns; thousands of workers in Port Elizabeth occupied office blocks and shops, while in Pietermaritzburg about 400 taxis clogged the city's roads. Further demonstrations are planned today. But the campaign seems to have peaked at Wednesday's rally in Pretoria, attended by more than 50,000 supporters of the African National Congress (ANC). There was speculation yesterday about an early resumption of constitutional talks, after comments by President F W de Klerk on Wednesday night. He said at an informal press conference that 'we are moving to the resumption of negotiations', and confirmed that discussions between the government and the ANC on 'specific issues' had been taking place over the past five days. He did not elaborate. It is known that one of the subjects discussed was the release of about 350 political prisoners. 'We need to broaden the discussion to include other issues,' Mr de Klerk added. 'I look forward to the day when Mr (Nelson) Mandela will once again see me in my office.' At least two armed white men dressed in camouflage uniforms were among attackers in the June 17 Boipatong massacre, according to a witness who testified yesterday before the Goldstone judicial commission of inquiry into political violence.

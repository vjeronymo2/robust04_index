In the opening of the news conference Koenig made a few  remarks, mentioning that he would like to elaborate a report  that should be as balanced as possible. He also said that a  special role in Romania's admittance as a full member of the  Council of Europe was played not merely by the report he  elaborated after his previous visit, but also by the  constructive position of the Democratic Convention of Romania  [CDR] and the ethnic minorities. Koenig emphasized the fact  that the favorable vote cast by the [Council of Europe]  parliamentarians proved that they have confidence in the  Romanian reform processes and that the goal of his current visit  is to verify the way in which our country is complying with the  pledges it made. Koenig also said that this is not an  exceptional procedure, but rather one that was begun with  Estonia and Slovakia and now continues with Romania. The  speaker added that he did not come to Bucharest together with  Jansson to teach Romania what to do, but rather to lend our  country a helping hand in the democratization process.    Referring to the ethnic minority issue, the two rapporteurs  outlined the fact that this issue is not specific merely to  Romania, as a majority of the Council of Europe member countries  are facing the same problem, and emphasized that the observance  of ethnic minority rights is part of the observance of human  rights. They also mentioned that according to the head of the  Romanian delegation to the Council of Europe, by 15 April  Romania will ratify the European Convention on Human Rights.  The rapporteurs also mentioned that fact that the citizens  belonging to ethnic minority groups have to be loyal to the  country the citizens of which they are and to fulfill their  duties, while the respective states have to offer them proper  conditions to maintain their ethnic identity. They also  assessed that Romania can play a very constructive role as a  point of stability on the Balkans and that our country's wish to  join the European family [of states] ought to be encouraged.    Yesterday Gunnar Jansson also met with the persons attending  the preparatory course designed to train experts in ethnic  minority issues and interethnic relations, which has been  organized by the Council for Ethnic Minorities with the support  of the European Center for Ethnic Issues and Social  Communication Studies of the Romanian Academy. Jansson  appreciated that course, asserting that it is unique throughout  Europe. He also appreciated the fact that a national committee  was set up to fight racism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism, and  intolerance, a body that was established following the  recommendations of the 1993 October Vienna conference of the  Council of Europe.</p>

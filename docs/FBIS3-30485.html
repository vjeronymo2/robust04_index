			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, Feb 4 (TANJUG) -- The Serbian Government  has announced that industrial producers should receive 200  million new dinars (equivalent to 200 million deutsche marks) in  the next two weeks for reviving production which has been at a  stand-still since international economic sanctions were imposed  on the country nearly two years ago. The step is just one of  production-boosting measures envisaged under a programme of  reconstructing the monetary system and healing the economy of  Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro).    The programme, launched on Janury 24, has already given  results, curbing what was a world record inflation and improving  supply on the market. The businessmen warn, however, that funds  are low for swinging the production cycle anew. The 200 million  dinars should be paid out of a fund that should be set up for  financing the economy, one-half of the money to be put up by the  banks' hard currency reserves, and the balance by the firms by  selling stock-piles and buying futures. However, not all of  Serbia's 199,500 firms can hope for a financial injection, but  only the manufacturers of easily marketable goods, Serbian  Industry Minister Momir Pavlicevic has told TANJUG.    Yugoslavia is implementing its monetary and economic  recovery  programme alone, without any outside assistance and in  conditions of draconic international sanctions, the worst ever  imposed on any nation, with its firms banned from the world  markets for both import and export of commodities and fuel.</p>

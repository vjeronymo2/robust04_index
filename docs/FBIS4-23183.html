			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  SUNDAY TIMES </H8>   Opposition to Taxes Criticized -- "The perpetual  handwringing  of the country's richest people, who seem to regard any taxation  as though it were a flesh-gobbling virus, is becoming tiresome,"  begins the Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES in English on 29 May in a  page-18 editorial. "The latest burst of neurotic anxiety arises  from speculation .... that President Mandela intends to impose a  surcharge of 10 percent on the taxes of the wealthy." The  editorial continues then by discussing the economic pro's and  con's of increased taxes, concluding that it is unlikely that  Mandela or Finance Minister Keys would impose such a surcharge.  "Why, then, the continual bursts of hysteria from the whites?"  "It is hard to explain, except in terms of neurotic guilt.  People who feel they have been unjustly enriched by apartheid  perhaps feel that the victims of apartheid will, sooner or  later, exact revenge. There is a simple answer to these  anxieties: it is what, in a different age, was called noblesse  oblige, or the obligation of the privileged to put back into  society some of the fruits of their good fortune. The policies  outlined by Mr Mandela are benign and reasonable," and "if the  hangwringing classes want to avoid special taxes and levies,  their best course of action is to seize the RDP [Reconstruction  and Development Program] as an opportunity, and make it work."  <H8>  RAPPORT </H8>   Editorial Warns Against `Exaggerated Expectations' -- "What  happened in the National Assembly this week was a remarkable  display of national unity and the honest desire for peace and  prosperity to reign in South Africa. All parties went out of  their way to show their loyalty to South Africa and to commit  themselves to a better standard of life for all people in the  country," notes a page-14 editorial in the Johannesburg RAPPORT  in Afrikaans on 29 May. "Even President Mandela said he would  go down on his knees to beg for peace. Beautiful -- but the  sober observer cannot help but wonder how long this peace will  continue." "It is said that President Mandela's speech was  better received in Houghton and Constantia than in Guguletu and  Soweto. Elements within the ANC view the president's policy  speech as a deviation from the socialist route and as pandering  to whites and the business community. Black critics of  President Mandela say, and not without grounds, that peace can  only be maintained if the government succeeds in meeting the  demands of its millions of young supporters." "It is clear that  there are exaggerated expectations of the economy. To mention  one example: Economists agree that there is no way Mr. Joe  Slovo will be able to build as many houses over the next five  years as he had promised to do." "During a visit to South  Africa two years ago, Mr. Lee Kuan Yew, the man who helped to  turn Singapore into an economic miracle, warned against high  expectations. Like the ANC his party also entered into an  alliance with the communists." "ANC supporters will have to  heed his advice. First look for stability through proven  economic policies."</p>

			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / London bus strike planned next week THE TGWU transport union yesterday said that the next in a series of one-day London bus strikes would take place on Friday, April 2 - the same day as the RMT rail union plans a strike against redundan-cies. This will be London bus workers' third day of strike action over wage cuts imposed in preparation for privatisation. The action is being taken even though more than 90 per cent of the workers, a majority of whom voted for industrial action, have accepted contracts of employment.</p>

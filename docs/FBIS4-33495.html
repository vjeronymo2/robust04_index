			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, June 4, IRNA -- The Foreign Ministry here  today reiterated that the three Lesser and Greater Tunbs as well  as Abu Musa Islands belonged to Iran according to the historical  documents, and welcomed talks with United Arab Emirates (UAE)  without any precondition.    Mahmud Mohammadi, a Foreign Ministry's spokesman, referred  to  the final communique of the (Persian) Gulf Cooperation Council  (PGCC) Sunday night [5 June], and said the communique did not  reportedly pass unanimously, and that all six PGCC ministers  were not present at the time of approval.    However, he stressed that according to the historical  documents the islands have always belonged to Iran, and said  Iran has always welcomed mutual talks with UAE without any  precondition. "The invitation for Shaykh Hamdan is still  valid," he added.    Prominent university scholars in a recent seminar in Paris  reviewed the historial documents on Iran's ownership of the  islands.    On the Saudi protest to the Iranian media reports concerning  Saudi Arabia, which had been included in the PGCC final  communique, Mohammadi said Iranian media "are totally free".    "The media in Iran criticize also formal policies of the  country most of the time, and our neighbours should understand  this reality," he said adding "on the other hand it is natural  that the media would react when they see the negligence of an  agreement."    Mohammadi also refuted the claims of Iran's support and  military aid to one of the warring sides in Yemen, and said Iran  had expressed its regret over the clashes and opposed any  military operations in Yemen. The Islamic Republic adopted an  impartial position and announced its readiness for mediation in  Yemen, he said.    More on the issue the spokesman said Iran is deeply  interested in the integrity of the Islamic countries, whose  disintegration, he said, are provoked by the foreigners. "We  support the settlement of disputes in a peaceful way."    "We are deeply sorry for the killing of each and every  Muslim  whether in the north or in the south, and we invite the two  sides to end the clashes and begin talks with the aim of  preservation of Yemen's unity," he said.    Mohammadi also invited other countries to show self-restrain  and avoid flaming the tension.</p>

			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / International Company News: Santander to reduce its lending rates on Monday BANCO Santander, the Spanish bank, yesterday broke with the tight monetary policies imposed by the Bank of Spain and said it would lower significantly lending rates on Monday. The bank said it was cutting its rates on mortgages, consumer credits, leasing and factoring by between 1 per cent and 1.5 per cent, and set its preferential lending rate at 12 per cent. The Bank of Spain, which is intent on maintaining the parity value of the peseta, has kept its benchmark intervention rate firm at 13 per cent, ignoring interest cuts elsewhere in Europe, and has kept the interbank rate at about 15 per cent. 'There is a difference between what the Bank of Spain does and what the market wants,' said Mr Rodrigo Echenique, managing director of the Santander group. 'The market is clamouring for lowered rates.' Telefonica, Spain's state-controlled telecommunications company and one of the most traded stocks on the Madrid stock market, raised its 1993 first-quarter net profits by 15.9 per cent to Pta14bn (Dollars 120.7m). The depressed economic conditions restricted growth in installed new lines during the quarter to 1.7 per cent. Operating profit rose by 8.5 per cent to Pta298.9bn.</p>

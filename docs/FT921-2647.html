			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Election '92: Smith takes the lead It is beginning to look as if it may all be going horribly sour. Last year Mr John Major believed his own Treasury's forecasts of an end to the recession before Christmas 1991. He should have known better. It is always an error to believe the Treasury. The forecasts were wrong, and so was the prime minister. He missed at least three good chances of calling an election on dates favourable to the Conservatives. Then the Majorites convinced themselves that they could face the voters in the middle of a prolonged recession and get away with it. This morning it appears that they may have been mistaken about that, too. They believed that the Budget presented by Mr Norman Lamont last week would set their campaign off to a flying start. It had no effect whatsoever. They thought that a schoolboy lark of a tax reduction would catch the opposition out. It did, for about two hours. Then the shadow chancellor, Mr John Smith, showed his boss, Mr Neil Kinnock, how to spring free. The Labour leads of 5 percentage points recorded in two opinion polls this morning are all Mr Smith's work, or nearly all if you take into account the assistance of Mr Norman Lamont. Mr Smith, who looks like a chancellor of the Exchequer, easily outperforms the Conservatives' Mr Lamont, who does not. I do not wish to be unfair to Mr Lamont, who has made the best of a difficult brief, but politics is not his strong suit. Nor is strategic thinking, unless you believe that the government's 20-per-cent-band Budget strategy was really Mr John Major's, or that of a committee of himself and close colleagues. Either way, it flopped. Mr Smith merely rejiggled the figures. He proposes to soak high earners in order to finance a tax bribe that will put some change in the pockets of 80 per cent of the electorate and increase pensions and child benefits for important sub-sections of it. Not only did he offer money, he also offered increases in expenditure on health and education to salve the consciences of the recipients of the bribes - and all for a public sector borrowing requirement not a penny larger than Mr Lamont's. Mr Smith then showed superhuman capacity as a salesman. He spent an indefatigable 24 hours appearing on every TV and radio spot, always looking like the most amiable, the most trustworthy, the most sagacious politician around. Mr Lamont assisted, by coming across as lugubrious, tetchy, and out of touch with the details of his brief. Today's polls are the pay-off. The question is, will they last? Labour leads in six of the nine polls taken since Mr Lamont's Budget, and in two of the three taken since Mr Smith's. Yet the game is not over. There are still three weeks to go. The Labour lead could melt away, to be replaced by a Tory advantage. It is hard to see what will achieve this, but elections are choreographed by the unpredictable. They are also choices of government teams. In previous elections differences in ideology or class interest determined voting behaviour. Now the parties are competing for a narrow stretch of middle ground. The outcome may well boil down to which of two sets of politicians is the most trusted. On the basis of the Budgets, Labour wins the first round. It may also be winning the argument about the continuing recession, although until very recently the public still trusted the Tories as the party best suited to get us out of the mess they got us into. This morning the two larger parties will publish their manifestos. This is a round yet to be fought. Do not expect too much of it. British voters are not intellectuals. Hardly any calculate the merits and demerits of every aspect of politicians' published documents and speeches before deciding who to support. That is why the parties are selling their best faces. The Tories probably have a few high cards here, but they do not win in every important department. Labour's Mrs Margaret Beckett is a more convincing chief secretary to the Treasury than Mr David Mellor. Mr Gordon Brown is a forceful Labour spokesman on industry. This knocks out his Tory opposite number, Mr Peter Lilley. The Conservatives have a huge asset in Mr Douglas Hurd, whose evident suitability for the job of Foreign Secretary is magnified by comparison with the negative image projected by his Labour shadow, Mr Gerald Kaufman. This is bad luck. Mr Kaufman is an amiable fellow in private. He is a student of musicals in general and Gene Kelly's show-stopping splash-dance in 'Singin' in the Rain' in particular. Alas, he too often defeats his own purpose by adopting a vituperative approach to political discourse. In the end the Tory campaign centres around the personality of Mr John Major. He chose the strategy. He is the strategy. He is effective in tonight's broadcast. Watch. You may decide to ignore this morning's polls and bet on him. It's your money.</p>

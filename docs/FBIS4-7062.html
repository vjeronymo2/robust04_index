			<p>BFN     [Text] A communist movement in the Philippines, the  National Democratic Front [NDF] celebrated its 21st anniversary,  Sunday, but reports saying the rift within the communist  movement is expanding as more statements were issued by factions  in observance of the group's anniversary. A spokesperson for  two breakaway communist factions in Mindanao in southern  Philippines said groups who oppose the leadership of exiled  communist leader Jose Maria Sison have been branded by forces  loyal to him as counter-revolutionaries.    Ike de los Reyes, speaking for NDF Central Mindanao and the  Moro Revolutionary Army said, members of the breakaway groups  now fear liquidation not only by the military but also by former  comrades who still acknowledge Sison's leadership. Europe based  critics of Sison also said a statement declaring they now  represent the real NDF indicating that the rift have extended to  the continent. Sison is himself exiled in the Utrecth,  Netherlands.</p>

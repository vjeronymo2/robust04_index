			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / UK Company News: ICI makes Dollars 300m Taiwan expansion ICI is planning to spend about Dollars 300m (Pounds 197m) on more than doubling the size of a chemicals plant in Taiwan. The scheme takes to over Dollars 600m the investment ICI has earmarked for increasing its capacity in terephthalic acid, a raw material used in polyester manufacture. Four weeks ago, ICI said it was planning to built a plant in Pakistan. The new Taiwanese plant, ICI's second at the Kuan Yin site, would be able to produce 450,000 tonnes of TPA a year. The existing 350,000 tonnes a year plant opened in 1992 and it currently being expanded to 400,000 tonnes. ICI said that the TPA market 'continues to surge'. World TPA demand had grown by 14 per cent a year since 1980 and even faster in Taiwan. Demand was 'capacity constrained' and prices 'were rising'. The new plant would use a proprietary technology to create 'the world's lowest cost production unit in terms of both capital and production costs,' said Mr David Hewitt, ICI's international TPA business manager. The plans, as with those for Pakistan, are subject to ICI board approval. If given the go-ahead, the second Kuan Yin plant should come on stream in 1997. The two Asian sites would then account for half ICI's world capacity in TPA. ICI denied the TPA investments signified a return to commodity chemicals. The company has been reorganising itself in recent years to concentrate on fewer areas in which it can add significant value and had a strong technological position. It said its proprietary manufacturing methods give it a technological advantage over competitors. ICI is the second biggest producer of the material in the world after Amoco, the US oil company. Asia is a popular location for investments to supply the fibres industry because of the strength and size of local customers.</p>

			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / International Company News: Improved sales help boost Sentrachem Sentrachem, the South African chemicals producer, turned in a solid performance for the year to August, raising net income 43 per cent to R159m (Dollars 45.3m) from R111m a year ago, writes Mark Suzman in Johannesburg. Turnover increased by 7 per cent to R2.8bn from R2.62bn, reflecting improved sales from most divisions, although troubled Mega Plastics remained under pressure. Operating income rose 16 per cent to R248m from R214m while finance charges dropped to R55m from R66m, largely as a result of a successful R289m rights issue in February. The dividend was increased 17 per cent to 28 cents from 24 cents. The group said that given the upturn in international chemical prices and the improvement in the commodity cycle, it expected earnings for the next financial year to improve significantly. It also noted that its reduced net borrowings of R147m, just 12 per cent of equity, left it in a strong position to take advantage of new projects or acquisitions.</p>

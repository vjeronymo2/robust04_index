			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / TUC says unions help competitiveness 'a great British invention' - can help employers become more competitive, according to the Trades Union Congress in evidence to a forthcoming parliamentary inquiry into the future of organised labour. The TUC document, which has been submitted to the House of Commons employment committee, argues that collective bargaining offers economies of scale and time to the employer by simplifying the fixing of terms and conditions of employment. It is particularly economical in large companies and 'minimises resentment caused by distinguishing between individual workers'. The document says strong collective bargaining systems give employers the flexibility to meet local needs or market conditions. 'In practice, in workplaces unions work in partnership with employers,' it says. The TUC also argues that change in the workplace is less difficult to achieve when unions have a key role. 'They bring expertise to the process and help prevent problems.' Union involvement means the introduction of new information technologies can be achieved more efficiently and with fewer problems. The TUC denies any inherent conflict between capital and labour in the workplace. Although unions are independent of an employer this 'does not imply a division of loyalties. It does not follow that trade unionists are less committed to their company than other employees.' The document recognises the structural changes taking place in the British labour market. These include a shift from manufacturing to services; the growth of employment in multinational companies and small companies; the deregulation of work; a tight legal framework; a larger female workforce and greater pay inequality. 'The typical worker of the nineties is likely to be a part-time woman worker whose employment is casual or semi-casual, working for a company whose own status is that of a sub-contracted or franchise operation,' it says. However, it argues that the 'basic rationale' for unions remains the same. 'They are needed now more than ever to ensure workers get a fair deal. Workers in unions earn better wages, have better conditions and are better protected against arbitrary employer action.'</p>

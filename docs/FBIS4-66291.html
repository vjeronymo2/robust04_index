			<p>CSO   <F P=106> ["Work Report of Jiangxi Provincial Higher People's Court </F> Delivered by Li Xiuyuan (2621 0208 3293) at the Second Session  of the Eighth Jiangxi Provincial People's Congress on 27  February 1994"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] I. Deal Severe Blows at  Serious Criminal and Economic Cases, Safeguard Social Stability  and Wage Struggles against Corruption    Social stability is the necessary pre-requisite and  guarantee to promoting the reform and opening-up program and  developing economic construction. To punish criminals according  to law, safeguard social stability and create a fine social  environment for developing the reform and opening-up program and  economic construction is the major responsibility of the  people's court. The courts at all levels in the province had  continued to implement the principle of "dealing heavy blows at  criminal offenses" and persistently and unflinching waged  struggles to strike at heinous criminals. In 1993, Jiangxi had  handled 9,426 criminal cases of the first instance and completed  9,304 of them. Among the 12,807 criminal offenders to whom  judgments have already become effective, 33.8 percent of them  were sentenced to more than five years of fixed imprisonment,  life imprisonment or death (including death penalty with a  suspension of execution); 65.5 percent of them were sentenced to  less than five years of fixed-term imprisonment, criminal  retention and public surveillance or given exemption from  criminal sanctions; and 0.7 percent of them were found not  guilty.    In their struggle against crimes which seriously endanger  public security, the courts at all levels paid attention to the  following work:    1. They concentrated their efforts on handling major cases.  They promptly handled, from the beginning to the end, those  criminal cases involving killing, robbery, kidnapping, rape and  hooligan activities, particularly major crimes committed by  criminal gangs. In all the criminal cases completed in 1993,  43.8 percent or 4,081 cases and 63 percent or 7,856 criminals  were involved in the aforementioned offenses.    2. They continued to coordinate with relevant departments  to vigorously wage struggles against larceny, train and highway  robberies, abducting and selling children, forcing women into  prostitution. Proceeding from reality, various localities dealt  heavy blows to those crimes on the priority list, and attained  remarkable results. In 1993, Jiangxi handled 652 cases involving  larceny and prosecuted 1,048 suspects; 282 cases involving the  "six evils" and prosecuted 414 offenders; and handled 303 cases  involving train and highway robberies and prosecuted 831  offenders.    3. They strengthened their forces to strike at criminal  activities, and persistently followed the principle of meting  out severe and swift punishment to criminals who serious  endangered public security. About 94 percent of the cases  wounded up in 1993 were completed within the legally prescribed  time limits. The number of heinous criminals sentenced to more  than five years of fixed-term imprisonment or death penalty rose  8.4 percent in 1993.    To deal heavy blows at criminals is an important aspect of  the struggle waged by the people's courts against criminal  activities. Economic crimes seriously jeopardized the ties of  the party and government with the masses, hindered the reform  and opening up program and interfered with economic  construction. The courts at all levels in the province had  continued to regard the struggle to strike at criminal crimes as  something of great significance in combating corruption, in  keeping a honest and clean government and in promoting economic  development. They firmly adhered to the principle of severely  punishing serious economic offenders in accordance with law. In  1993, people's courts in Jiangxi had accepted 990 economic cases  of the first instance publicly prosecuted by the procuratorial  organs, and completed 944 of them. Except those cases for which  appeals were being lodged and those which were sent back to  procuratorial organs for reinvestigation or withdrawal, actions  taken against 1,865 offenders had already become legally  effective, of whom 765 were sentenced to more than five years of  fixed-term imprisonment, life imprisonment and death, 1,100 of  them were sentenced to less than five years of fixed-term  imprisonment, criminal retention and public surveillance, 114  were exempted from criminal sanctions and 23 of them were found  not guilty. Among the criminals convicted, 197 committed  offenses involving more than 10,000 yuan each and 56 committed  crimes involving over 100,000 yuan each. A total of 5.91 million  yuan of economic losses were recovered for the state.    In order to further intensify the struggle against  corruption, the people's courts in the province had persistently  struck at corrupt state functionaries who accepted bribery and  engaged in embezzlement. They resolutely meted out punishment on  this type of offenses as soon as the cases were accepted by the  court and the suspects were proved guilty. In 1993, Jiangxi  completed 149 cases of the first instance involving corruption,  bribery and embezzlement, accounting for 16 percent of all the  criminal cases. Two hundred fifteen offenders were convicted  including eight county and department-level cadres. At the same  time, actions were taken to severely deal with smugglers,  swindlers and tax dodgers and those who faked trademarks; sold  and manufactured fake and shoddy merchandise; and seriously  undermined the economic order. In 1993, Jiangxi had concluded  109 trials of the aforementioned category, and convicted 184  offenders whose sentences had already become legally effective.  In dealing with offenses of this category, other punishments  such as imposing fines, confiscating properties and others were  also meted out along with other severe punishments so as to  prevent the criminals from reaping economic benefits.    After the arrangements were made by the second plenary  session of the CPC Central Discipline Inspection Commission for  the anti-corruption struggle in August 1993, the courts at  various levels in the province had exerted even greater efforts  in striking at economic crimes. They strengthened their efforts  to handle the major cases exposed in the anti-corruption  struggle and completed the trials in a timely manner, once the  procuratorial organs started the prosecution procedure. They  paid full attention to facts and the evidence and handled all  cases in accordance with law. They closely followed the  principle of "being firm, prudent and accurate," and ensured  that all cases were handled properly and carefully. From  September to December 1993, Jiangxi had accepted and concluded  517 economic cases, up 90 cases over the same period in 1992.  There were 133 major cases involving corruption, bribery and  embezzlement for which 11 criminals were sentenced to more than  10 years of fixed-term imprisonment; two of them to life  imprisonment and another two to the death penalty with a  suspension of execution. In addition, two of the criminals were  sentenced to death, pending the approval of the Supreme People's  Court. In order to meet the requirements set by the central  authorities and the provincial CPC committee to attain  achievements against corruption in different stages in the near  future, the people's courts in various localities held  sentence-pronouncing rallies during which verdicts were passed  on a group of major criminal offenders involving corruption,  bribery and embezzlement. At the end of 1993, the provincial  people's court had taken an unified action to pronounce  sentences on a number of major cases which attracted widespread  attention of the general public. It made a province-wide group  announcement in public and even held a news briefing in this  connection. It created a great impact and good social effects on  the society.  <H5>  II. Regulate Economic Relations in Accordance With Law, </H5> Actively Serve Macro-Control and Develop Market Economy    In the course of promoting the national economy with a high  speed last year, there emerged some contradictions and problems  in China's economic life. Some of them were quite outstanding.  The party CPC Committee made a timely policy decision to  strengthen and improve the macro-economic control. In order to  ensure the smooth implementation of the major policy decision  made by the central authorities and maintain the normal economic  order, the people's courts at various levels throughout the  province adopted effective measures to vigorously strengthen  their efforts in trying cases involving economic crimes. In  1993, they handled a total of 38,285 economic cases of the first  instance with a total amount of 966 million yuan involved, up  35.7 percent and 129 percent respectively over 1992.    We had paid particular attention to handling the following  types of cases.    1) We actively handled cases involving state-owned  enterprises which were changing the way they operated;  protected, in accordance with law, the legal interests of the  enterprises and the managing companies by trying cases which  involved contracting, leasing, joint operation, merging,  shareholding and bankruptcy procedures for various enterprises.  We had helped enterprises change the way their operated and  establish a modern enterprise system; and provided them with the  legal protection to become market-oriented. In 1993, Jiangxi had  handled a total of 1,204 cases of the aforementioned nature,  accounting for 3.2 percent of the total number of cases handled.    2) We concentrated our efforts in handling cases involving  marketing, money-borrowing, financing, investment in  shareholding form, patent, trademark and disputes over  technological contracts; and helped improve the markets for  merchandise, funds and technologies. In 1993, Jiangxi had  handled 26,086 cases of this category, accounting for 68 percent  of the total number of cases handled. Many of the cases were of  a new variety. With the rapid development of the reform program  in China and the legislature lagging hind, the courts in various  localities extensively conducted investigation and studies,  continuously summed up their experiences, and followed the basic  principle that they applied laws whenever there were laws in  this connection. They applied the policy whenever there are no  laws or regulations in this connection. They acted in accordance  with the basic principle of the law when both the law and the  policy in this connection were not so clear. We persistently  handled cases in accordance with the principle of the "three  conducive's."    3) We properly handled cases concerning the development of  rural economy. In 1993, Jiangxi had handled 2,161 cases  involving disputes over the rural contract system, up 3.4  percent over 1992. At the same time, we had also handled a large  number of economic disputes among rural enterprises. By means of  various adjudicative activities, we had safeguarded the  household contract responsibility system, helped rural  enterprises improve their management and invigorated the rural  economy in an overall manner.    In order to keep pace with the new situation in economic  development and satisfy the growing needs for the judicial  sector to serve the market economy, the people's courts at  various levels had improved their services and their work, and  provided legal consultations for the development of economic  construction. They adopted the following measures:    1. They carried out specialized judicial work in  coordination with the macro-control. They took the initiative to  help the financial sector collect its loans in accordance with  law, support the tax authorities to levy taxes and assist the  land office and the transportation department to collect  necessary fees. They also helped the various enterprises clear  up their debts, assisted people settle their economic disputes,  and helped maintain the normal economic order.    2. They simplified the litigation procedure and raise their  efficiency in handling cases. They vigorously carried out their  mediation work, provided supervision and ensured that all legal  procedures were properly followed. They made efforts to reduce  some unnecessary steps in lawsuit. In 1993, 69.1 percent of the  cases involving economic disputes were concluded through  mediation. The various basic-level people's courts handled  12,011 cases involving simple economic disputes.    3. They took the initiative to provide legal services in  various enterprises and economic departments at the latter's  doorsteps. They sometimes set up liaison offices or send out  tribunals to help enterprises and the departments concerned  clear up their debts, settle economic disputes, become more  competitive on the market, train people to handle legal affairs,  run business in accordance with law. Their measures taken were  warmly praised by the enterprises and the departments concerned.  <H5>  III. Correctly and Properly Handle Civil and Administrative </H5> Cases; and Protect legal Rights and Interests of citizens, Legal  Persons and Other Organizations in Accordance With Law    To protect the legal rights and interests of citizens and  legal persons from encroachment is an important aspect of  socialist democracy and the legal system. To correctly and  timely handle civil and administrative cases is of great  significance in maintaining social stability, promoting  production and developing spiritual civilization.    Civil rights are basic rights of the citizens and legal  persons. With more changes taking place in society and people's  mind and with the rapid development of the market economy,  contacts among the people have become closer, and there are more  civil cases for the people's courts to handle. Particularly with  the continuous development of the legal relations in civil  affairs, the number of cases involving properties and individual  rights and interests is on the increase every year. The work in  handling civil cases has become more closely related with  economic construction, especially with the development of the  market economy. In 1993, Jiangxi had concluded 66,521 civil  cases of the first instance, up 32.1 percent over 1992. It had  placed emphasis on handling civil cases of the following  categories:    1) It handled many civil cases involving marriage and family  problems. For many years in the past, the number of divorce  cases ranked top among all the civil cases handled. In 1993,  Jiangxi had concluded 23,252 cases of this category. With the  changes of the people's concept on marriage, family and  property, not only the number of divorce cases is increasing,  there are more problems in dividing properties, child-care and  housing allotment. The people's courts properly handled divorce  cases in strict accordance with the Marriage Law, and helped  strengthen the socialist system about marriage and family.    2) It energetically handled trials concerning liabilities,  real estate and labor disputes. With the vigorous development of  the reform and opening-up program and the booming economic  activities within the nongovernment sector, there were  increasing number of disputes concerning debts, real estate and  labor. In 1993, Jiangxi had concluded 13,172 cases concerning  debts, 894 cases on houses and 465 cases involving labor  disputes. By handling trials of these categories, the people's  courts had made the money, real estate and labor markets  flourish.    3) It had properly handled civil cases involving disputes on  land, forest, water conservancy, ownership of or the rights to  use plots for housing projects. In 1993, Jiangxi concluded 330  cases of this category. Most of these cases were in the rural  areas. They directly affected production and livelihood of the  masses, and at times, problems became quite serious. By properly  handling such cases, the people's courts had timely solved the  problems, eliminated the factors of instability, helped maintain  social stability in rural areas and promoted agricultural  production.    The trial of administrative cases is an important step in  developing the socialist democratic politics. Since the official  enactment of the "Administrative Procedure Law of the People's  Republic of China" on 1 October 1990, the work of administrative  trials has entered a new stage in Jiangxi. The number of  administrative lawsuits was on the increase every year, and the  scope of litigation is continuously expanding. In 1993, Jiangxi  had handled 805 administrative cases, up 21.9 percent over 1992.  It had concluded 786 cases in which the ruling of the  administrative organization was upheld in 33 percent of the  cases, annulled in 20 percent of the cases, and changed in 2.2  percent of the cases. The plaintiffs withdrew suits in 35.8  percent of the cases. In addition, 1,744 cases were handled  involving a total amount of 2.43 million yuan, whereas  administrative organs had requested that judgements be forcibly  executed.    In the course of handling administrative lawsuits, the  people's courts not only protected, in accordance with law, the  legal interests of the citizens and legal persons and other  organizations, but also helped and supervised the administrative  organs to exercise their functions and powers. They mainly paid  attention to the following tasks:    1. They strengthened their efforts in handling cases  involving enterprises' autonomy in management, preventing others  from infringing upon the rights of the enterprises, safeguarding  their market share and interests and helping them change the way  they operate.    2. They strengthened their efforts in handling cases which  involved land, industrial and commercial administration,  taxation, finance, foreign exchange, commodity price and  technological supervision and management, and in maintaining  order for market competition. Meanwhile, they thwarted improper  actions of the administrative organizations and other illegal  administrative measures which undermined the economy, punished  the enterprises without the proper authority, indiscriminately  meting out punishments, recklessly set up roadblocks, collected  excessive fees, and illegally increase peasants' burdens.    3. They strengthened their efforts in handling cases which  involved public security, shelter and surveillance, re-education  through labor and infringement of citizens' rights. They  protected, in accordance with law, the interests of the  citizens; eliminated the sense of antagonism between the  administrative organizations and the public; and reduced the  factors of social instability.    4. They strengthened their efforts in handling cases whereas  the administrative organs had requested that judgments be  executed by force, supported administrative organs in carrying  out their work and help them maintain their administrative  authority. Cases involving the execution of administrative  orders often aroused major public interests, involved the  overall situation of state administration, and directly affected  economic construction and social stability. In handing cases of  this category, the people's courts had persistently followed the  principle of being vigorous, reliable and safe. They not only  dared to help administrative organs implement their orders, but  also carried out a great deal of publicity, re-education and  persuasion work to help ease contradictions.    During the past year, Jiangxi had steadily and continuously  extended their legal services in handling administrative  lawsuits. However, the system of administrative lawsuits had not  been established too long, the people's courts were still  unfamiliar with lawsuits of this category, and some of the  judicial cadres who handle such cases still showed sentiments of  fearing difficulties. Therefore, to further study, popularize  and implement the Law of Administrative Procedure remains an  important task in the near future. The people's courts at  various levels are earnestly summing up their experiences,  overcoming difficulties, continuously improving the environment  in enforcing this law and marching forward in handling  administrative lawsuits.  <H5>  IV. Rely on Judicial Work, Actively Improve All Facets of </H5> Public Security in Society    To improve all facets of public security in the society is a  basic policy in maintaining a lasting order in our country. It  also represents a basic principle of Chinese characteristics in  doing our judicial work. In handling trials of all types over  the past year, the people's courts at various levels throughout  the country paid attention to performing their functions well in  carrying out their judicial work, and energetically improved all  the facets of public security in society. They mainly performed  the following duties:    1) They persistently held open trials, gave widespread  publicity to the socialist legal system and called on people to  observe discipline and abide by laws. The courts in the province  held a total 465 rallies to announce judgments with a total  audience of 3.12 million people in the last year.    2) In the course of dealing with the lawsuits, they also  made judicial suggestions. When they tried cases of various  categories, they discovered that some departments and units had  many loopholes and problems in their management system. In light  of these loopholes and problems, they made judicial suggestions.  In 1993, Jiangxi had made 3,576 judicial suggestions, a great  majority of which were accepted by the units concerned. It had  attained remarkable social effects.    3) They strengthened their work for juvenile courts. They  meted out appropriate penalties on young criminals, while  protecting the legal rights and interests of the juvenile  delinquents. Meanwhile some juvenile courts also sponsored study  classes and parents' schools to educate juvenile delinquents by  persuasion and prevent them from committing crimes again.    4) Proceeding from the desire to reform juvenile delinquents  and prevent them from committing crimes once again, they often  reduced their sentences, put them on probation or released them  on parole in accordance with law. In 1993, Jiangxi reduced  sentences in 6,490 cases, released 553 juvenile delinquents on  parole and put 1,888 of them on probation, accounting for 15  percent of the total number of delinquents. A system was set up  in many localities to visit juvenile delinquents on probation or  parole after they were released. The juvenile courts also  coordinated with the departments concerned and the basic-level  organizations to help those on parole or probation to reform and  educate themselves.    5) They carried out their mass work well inside and outside  the courts, and correctly used legal means to solve various  kinds of contradictions. The people's courts at various levels  paid full attention to enhancing social stability; implemented  the policy of correctly handling the contradictions among the  people; and used this policy to guide their judicial work. The  civil and administrative lawsuits involve many aspects and are  closely related with the masses. Through these civil and  administrative cases, the people's courts understood the  situation in the community well, made preparations way ahead to  help various departments concerned solve various contradictions  and problems. In handling civil and administrative lawsuits, the  people's courts in the province continued to uphold the  principle of conducting mediation to solve disputes, always  tried to reason things with both parties in dispute and helped  them to accommodate each other and reach agreement on their own  accord, to end their disputes and to avoid the accumulation of  contradictions.

			<p><P> August 1, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> CUOMO BACKS ROSE ON HALL OF FAME  </P> <P> Gov. Mario M. Cuomo says Cincinnati Reds Manager Pete Rose should make  baseball's Hall of Fame regardless of whether he bet on baseball games.  </P> <P> "What if he had six wives who said he was a boor and he died an alcoholic?"  asked Cuomo, a former minor league baseball player and avid fan. "Character  becomes a very elusive criteria. How do you measure it? When do you choose to  use that criteria?"  </P> <P> Rose, baseball's all-time hit leader, would be banned from baseball if he is  found to have bet on his own teams. Even if he is banned, Rose could still be  elected to the Hall of Fame. As the Rose case proceeds through the courts, the  debate continues over whether he should be allowed into the hall if the  allegations are true.  </P> <P> "I think you have to define what the Hall of Fame is," said Cuomo, who played  briefly in the Pittsburgh Pirates farm system. "If the Hall of Fame is for  baseball players who were great baseball players, I'd put him in the Hall of  Fame.  </P> <P> "Whose face is up on the mountain, Jefferson?" added Cuomo, referring to Mt.  Rushmore. "He had a mistress."  </P></p>

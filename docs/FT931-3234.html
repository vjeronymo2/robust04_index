			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: 5 per cent cost added to US housebuilding The squeeze on timber harvesting and the resulting surge in lumber prices has added as much as 5 per cent to the cost of building a new home in the US, a development that is only partially offset by falling mortgage rates and rising new home demand, writes Laurie Morse in Chicago. The rocketing cost of lumber has prompted the influential National Association of Home Builders, a 160,000-member organisation, to ask President Bill Clinton to convene a meeting between US logging and environmental interests. Mr Clinton has asked Vice President Al Gore to organise the meeting. Mr Michael Carliner, chief economist for the home builders' group, said a 90 per cent rise in lumber prices since October had increased the cost of building a 2,000 square foot home that might sell for Dollars 120,000 by about Dollars 4,500. It takes an estimated 15,000 board feet of lumber to build an average home, with wood products used for flooring and trim as well as framing. The average price for 1,000 board feet of a mixture of lumber grades, as reported by the Random Lengths Lumber service, was Dollars 474 last week, up from Dollars 249 in October. 'The market has probably overshot its mark, with a lot of panic buying,' said Mr Carliner. 'Lumber producers who own their own forest land may be holding product off the market waiting for higher prices.' Timber sales from the south-eastern US are rising to fill the supply gap, but analysts say the south is also facing restrictions because of the endangered species act and a broader definition of wetlands.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Not Rivals, but Partners"] </F>   [Text] Powerful superheavy trucks, with which Russians are  more familiar from foreign movies, will shortly appear on our  national highways. There are plans to produce them at a joint  enteprise in Moscow set up by ZiL and the U.S. firm Packard.    The agreements on starting this production are largely  ready,  your ITAR-TASS correspondent was told by ZiL First Deputy  General Director Valeriy Saykin. "ZiL-Packard" is the proposed  name of the powerful truck capable of carrying over 20 tonnes of  freight. The vehicle plus the freight and trailer weighs over  40 tonnes altogether.    The first step toward this cooperation was the creation of  the "Novotrak" joint enterprise, which sells diesel-engined ZiL  trucks and ships some types of heavy truck from the United  States; the second was the signing of the documents of  association creating the "Novodizel" Joint Enterprise, which  will manufacture more sophisticated fuel equipment for ZiL  trucks. In the opinion of U.S. specialists, using this  equipment will help make annual fuel savings of around $200  million.    "In addition to joint production of heavy trucks," Valeriy  Saykin concluded, "we intend to organize production of diesel  engines in conjunction with the Caterpillar firm, first using  foreign spare parts and subsequently switching to producing all  the necessary components in Russia."</p>

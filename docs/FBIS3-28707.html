			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 9 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Tsutomu  Hata, leaving on short notice for Washington on Wednesday  evening [9 February], said he will try to resolve the  differences on trade between Japan and the United States before  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's summit meeting with U.S.  President Bill Clinton. Hata said he will try to break the  deadlock between trade negotiators of the two countries so that  Hosokawa and Clinton can look back on the results of the talks  with satisfaction when they meet Friday.    The foreign minister, who was originally scheduled to depart  for Washington along with Hosokawa on Thursday, said he was  leaving early on instructions from the premier. He said his  schedule in Washington has yet to be fixed.    Hata, who doubles as deputy prime minister, said he will  impress upon his U.S. interlocutors how determinedly the present  administration has been in its attempts to revive the Japanese  economy and stimulate increased imports from the U.S. and other  countries. He suggested there is a lack of understanding in the  U.S. Government in that regard.    Hosokawa and Clinton are scheduled to assess progress in the  bilateral economic talks being held under a trade framework  accord concluded last July. Hata said he wants to tackle the  matter before the summit begins, so that the two leaders can  have broad discussions on areas other than the economy.    Asked about the idea of setting numerical targets to gauge  the openness of Japanese markets, Hata did not dismiss it out of  hand, saying instead, "we will discuss the matter keeping in  mind the potential implications, including what the implications  could be internationally."    But Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura suggested  earlier Wednesday that Tokyo will continue to oppose such a  move. "In the negotiations, the Japanese Government has taken  the stance that it is very difficult to accept the proposal for  numerical targets," he said.    Takemura added he believes Hata "will finalize political  negotiations before the summit in line with this basic stance."</p>

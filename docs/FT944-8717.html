			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Willis Corroon to cut jobs after fall Willis Corroon, the insurance broker, yesterday launched a sweeping restructuring of its main businesses, involving substantial job cuts, in an attempt to correct an 'unsatisfactory' profits performance. The group said it was making an exceptional charge of Pounds 40m this year to cover reorganisation and streamlining costs, about half of which may pay redundancy expenses. The cost of surplus properties leased by the group is also being written off. Willis has set a target of reducing costs by at least Pounds 30m a year  - about 5 per cent of operating expenses - but refused to say how many jobs might be lost. Willis employs about 11,300 worldwide. The announcement came as the group reported a fall in pre-tax profits in the first nine months of 1994 to Pounds 54.4m from Pounds 70.1m. Willis blamed poor trading conditions but also said expenses in continuing operations had risen 6 per cent, partly because of the cost of reforming its US construction operation. Operating revenues fell to Pounds 549.3m in the first nine months from Pounds 576.3m. The group will pay a fourth interim dividend of 1.65p in January. Willis' shares closed up 8p at 146p with analysts welcoming the group's decision to make strategic changes. But there was scepticism that target cost savings could be achieved quickly and fears about the impact on Willis' staff morale. Profit forecasts for the full year have been cut to about Pounds 15m. Willis' restructuring also reflects mounting competitive pressures in insurance broking as premium rates stabilise or fall and big client companies move towards managing risks internally or buying fee-based consultancy rather than commission-based broking services. Mr Max Taylor, chief operating officer, said: 'There are attractive returns to be made in the insurance broking business'. He added that Willis may form an unspecified number of business units reporting to the board, rather than the current split into a retail broking network and a specialist insurance and reinsurance operation. A minor negative impact on Willis' revenues is expected over the next year.</p>

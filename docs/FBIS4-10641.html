			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Wilfer Pulgarin] </F>   [Text] President Rafael Caldera has expressed his regret  that at the present time, 34 years after the agrarian reform  program was adopted, this social and economic institution has  suffered from a deterioration in its public image. At the same  time he took advantage of the occasion to warn that a similar  fate could affect the autonomy of universities and state  governments.    The president, who was an honored guest at the anniversary  ceremony held on 5 March at the offices of the National Agrarian  Institute, stated that so noble an institution as the agrarian  reform, which was promulgated on 5 March 1960, should be  preserved and its name should cease being something which is  "taboo."    He said that, in his view agrarian reform is now, according  to a substantial number of Venezuelans, the origin of a process  of "parceling out production funds to the political leaders of  groups of farmers who exploited their lands and then left them  in an abandoned and depressed state. They let them go, so that,  finally, they fell into the hands of those who were prepared to  work them and make them fruitful. They were therefore violating  the provisions, limits, and principles set down in the law  itself."    In the president's view that irreversible process can happen  to university autonomy in Venezuela which, "in the view of large  numbers of people, is nothing more than a symbol for disorder,  conflict, class suspensions, and a low return in educational  activity."    He extended his warning to "such an important institution as  the autonomy of state governments (which) runs the risk of  becoming a roadway for regional dictators and for the  degeneration of the fundamental, necessary, and creative sense  of our Venezuelan fatherland."    He observed that in view of the low opinion which agrarian  reform has he has decided to suggest to Minister of Agriculture  Ciro Anez Fonseca an addition to or even a change in that name,  using such terms as "rural, democratic solidarity," "democratic  solidarity in the countryside," "agricultural solidarity,"  "productive solidarity," etc.    However, he emphasized that the most important aspect is  that  the institution of agrarian reform should move forward, "With  the conviction that the fight to rescue agriculture in Venezuela  is an essential element, without which we could not offer to new  generations of our people the security of a firm and solid  economy and a country which enjoys its human rights and social  peace in security. This is essential to conquer the future."    Also participating in the day's program, in addition to the  chief of state and the minister of agriculture and animal  husbandry, were Isabel Urbano, president of the IAN [National  Agrarian Institute], and delegates from farmers' and production  associations.    On the same occasion the president pointed out that  democracy  must confront in real terms the subject of land ownership and  access to it by peasant farmers.    He referred to the problem of communities of indigenous  people, stating that these groups should be provided with help  to guarantee their natural habitat. At the same time they should  be given suitable assistance to ensure their progress as  citizens of the fatherland.    The president said: "I am committed to achieving an  environment of peace, justice, equity, understanding, and  harmony in the countryside, between capitalist enterprise which  is beginning to emerge in many areas and the people who have a  right to the land which they work."    He said that he was convinced that, "The bad name of the  agrarian reform" has distorted the views of many people. He  invited his listeners to read Chapter 7 of the book, El  Caso Venezuela, una Ilusion de Armonia [The Case of  Venezuela, an Illusion of Harmony], published by the IESA  [Institute of Higher Education for Administration]. In this  book, he said, the view that the agrarian reform law has been  the factor responsible for the crisis in the agricultural sector  is proved to be false.    Meanwhile Ciro Anez Fonseca, the minister of agriculture and  animal husbandry, stated that the problem of refinancing the  private agricultural debt, estimated at 40 billion bolivares,  has been definitively resolved.    He said: "Now there is no need for concern about that  problem. The banks are accepting a new way of treating customers  who are behind in their payments, and there is no reason for  anything but the optimism of 1994."    He explained that, in the first place, financial  institutions  have committed themselves to giving special treatment to  customers in the agricultural sector who are behind in the  repayment of their loans. He indicated that in addition to this  there is a formula which the government is developing which has  the objective of providing the banking sector with the necessary  resources to compensate for these delays in the repayment of  loans.    He referred to the recently established commission for the  evaluation of agrarian reform, which Victor Gimenez Landinez  will head, as the instrument for providing a new start to the  Law on Agrarian Reform, making use of the economic and social  development of the country.</p>

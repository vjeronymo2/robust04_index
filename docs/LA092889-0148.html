			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> QUAYLE TO HOLD TALKS ON CAMBODIA POLICY  </P> <P> Vice President Dan Quayle, winding up a two-week tour of Asia that concentrated  on U.S. security issues, plans to meet today with officials of four Southeast  Asian nations in a bid to revive U.S. policy toward Cambodia.  </P> <P> Quayle will meet with representatives of Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore and  Indonesia shortly after arriving in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia's capital, a senior  U.S. official traveling with the vice president said.  </P> <P> "The reality is, we don't know very much about what's going on inside  Cambodia," the official said. "The function of the meeting will be to get their  views about exactly where we stand."  </P> <P> Quayle also plans to meet with Malaysian officials to soothe feelings ruffled  last month when officials of neighboring Singapore suggested that they might be  willing to play host to U.S. naval facilities now in the Philippines.  </P> <P> Malaysia and Singapore have had troubled relations in the past, and Malaysian  officials are not eager to have their neighbor playing host to a major military  installation.  </P> <P> The future of the U.S. bases in the Philippines dominated the past two days of  Quayle's trip.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, Quayle presented President Corazon Aquino with a letter from  President Bush formally asking that negotiations over the future of the bases  begin in December. In a reply letter to Bush, Aquino agreed to the proposal.  </P> <P> "I, too, envision fruitful discussions in the spirit of amity that has marked  our long relationship," Aquino wrote.  </P> <P> While negotiations over the bases promise to be difficult, advancing U.S.  policy in Cambodia has proven all but impossible for a decade.  </P> <P> </P> <P> One Goal Realized  </P> <P> In recent weeks the United States has seen one goal realized -- the withdrawal  from Cambodia of Vietnamese troops. But the broader goal espoused by the U.S.  government and its Southeast Asian allies has proven elusive.  </P> <P> The goal has been to free Cambodia from Vietnamese domination without restoring  to power the brutal Khmer Rouge, blamed for the deaths of more than 1 million  Cambodians by disease, starvation and execution during a 3 1/2-year rule that  ended with the Vietnamese invasion of late December, 1978.  </P> <P> As an alternative to both the Communist Khmer Rouge and the Vietnamese-backed  government headed by Hun Sen, the United States has pushed a coalition of  non-Communist resistance groups. Earlier this year, Quayle helped lobby through  Congress a bill authorizing military assistance to those forces.  </P> <P> But aid to the resistance remains controversial, because the non-Communist  groups are allied, at least for now, with the Khmer Rouge.  </P> <P> With the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops, and the collapse last month of Paris  talks on a Cambodian settlement, further fighting is expected between Cambodian  government troops and the three-party resistance forces.  </P> <P> Quayle hopes that the ambassadors he meets will offer some ideas about steps  that might stave off renewed large-scale fighting in Cambodia. He also would  like to see a new endorsement of the policy of aiding the non-Communist rebels.  </P> <P> The policy disturbs some Administration officials and many in Congress because  it runs the risk of returning the Khmer Rouge to at least partial power.  </P></p>

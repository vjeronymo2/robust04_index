			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["U.S. Fanatics Denounced for Pressure on DPRK " -- KCNA </F> headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, June 9 (KCNA) -- The U.S. paper BALTIMORE  SUN recently accused some forces in the United States of crying  for "sanctions" against the Democratic People's Republic of  Korea over "nuclear suspicion."    In an editorial the paper said the pressure of nuclear  non-proliferation has always been put on small nations by big  powers possessed of nuclear weapons.    Noting that it is hard to understand why the United States  is  putting pressure only on North Korea, it charged that some  forces in the United States, captivated by a sense of racial  superiority, have created such a crisis.    Asking what is the reason to conclude that North Korea poses  threat to mankind, the paper said it is because there are  fanatics in the United States that the United States is kicking  up a row only against North Korea, though some countries have  developed or are developing nuclear weapons.</p>

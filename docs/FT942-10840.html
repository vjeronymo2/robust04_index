			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Change in lending forecast by Bank The growth of the asset-backed securities market could have far-reaching effects on the structure of lending in the UK, according to a report on securitisation released by the Bank of England today. The author of the report, Mr Ian Twinn of the Bank's economics division, suggests that this growth may allow new institutions to enter the lending market and compete against traditional lenders, potentially reducing costs for borrowers, for example in the mortgage market. Asset-backed securities are tradeable instruments backed by a pool of loans or other assets. The process of 'securitisation' allows an institution to remove these assets from its balance sheet. The report says the UK asset-backed securities market has become second only to that of the US. There is still room for substantial growth as only a small proportion of total UK lending has been securitised. By the end of last year Pounds 16bn of issues had been launched, the report says. This compared with about Pounds 640bn of lending by banks and building societies. Mortgage-backed securities accounted for 81 per cent of the asset-backed market in the UK at the end of last year. However, Mr Twinn says the further development of the market depends on the cost of securitisation relative to other sources of funding.</p>

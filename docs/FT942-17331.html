			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Nurturing a landless nation: Judy Dempsey visits the displaced Sorb people of Germany The children hardly said a word. Frowning with concentration, they dipped their goose-feather quills into a warm jar of honey-comb wax to mark areas of natural colour on egg shells. Then they started drawing elaborate designs on the shells with dyes, before covering them with grease to make them shiny. Like their parents, the children were dressed in the traditional bright clothes of the Sorbs, as they prepared for Easter Sunday in the German hamlet of Neuwiese in Saxony. 'When you paint three crosses on the egg, it's a sign that you want to keep the evil spirits away,' said Mrs Slyvia Panoscha. 'When you paint a star with six corners, it is to thank the bees for the honey and wax. 'When you paint a star on top of the egg, it symbolises life. We are brought up knowing these things. I hope the traditions will live on with these children here.' The Sorbs are descendents of the west Slavs who migrated from the Carpathian mountains in northern Romania and made their way northwards to the river Elbe. They now live in Upper and Lower Lusatia, straddling the states of Brandenburg and Saxony. They number fewer than 60,000 but senior members of the Sorb community believe they are witnessing something of a revival since German unification. Few, however, have any illusions about the difficulties in protecting a community which has undergone natural, and forced, assimilation. 'As an ethnic group, we were always under pressure,' said Johann Kaspar, a 62-year-old Sorb who speaks a Slav language closer to Czech than to Polish. 'Thousands emigrated for economic reasons in the 19th century,' said Mr Bernhard Ziesch, a senior member of the Domowina, or Association for Sorbs based in Bautzen. Many settled in Texas in the US, or in Australia - 'but we still kept out culture alive through music, dance, song and customs. It was hard. Those who remained had to find work in the brown-coal mines and move to the cities. They soon became completely Germanised. They intermarried. They lost their identity as Sorbs.' He and Mr Kaspar believe, however, the Sorbs suffered most under the Nazis. 'I was just a boy at the time,' said Mr Kaspar, 'and I remember that the Sorb schools were closed. We were forbidden to speak the language in public. But my parents kept speaking Sorb at home and so did I' When the East German communist party was established in 1949, the Sorb language and culture were allowed again, schools were re-opened, public signs were bi-lingual. But the Sorbs were not allowed any links with the diaspora. According to Mr Ziesch, there are about 125,000 Sorbs world-wide. 'It is only since the Wende, or change, in 1989, that we can set up cultural links with our fellow Sorbs throughout the world,' he says. Unification also led to the states of Brandenburg and Saxony ensuring that Sorbs could attend schools in their own language. There are now seven primary schools and six secondary schools for the Sorbs, and about 50 mixed German and Sorb schools. But the assimilation has not been halted. 'With German unification, the children now want to watch video games and all that sort of thing,' said 65-year-old Mrs Magdelene Balting, whose son Lotar, 45 and unemployed, cannot speak Sorb. 'I was posted in the army, and was later a policeman, so I just spoke German,' he says. Even the fervent Mr Kaspar, who speaks German with a thick Slav accent, said it was a struggle trying to get his own children to speak Sorb. 'I married, but she is a German, not a Sorb. . . The German language won the day]' Yet as the children painted the egg shells throughout the afternoon, many of their parents said they were confident they would learn Sorb. Ms Barbara Krahal, a shop assistant, and Ms Kirstin Bohm, an architect, feel they are Sorbs. 'Our citizenship is German, but our nationality is Sorb, and I hope our children will feel themselves to be Sorb.' 'It is up to us, as parents, to keep the culture alive,' said Ms Bohm. 'Now that we have all the freedom to do so, it might be harder, but the signs are that the children do want to learn about our past and traditions, as they are doing today in this hall.' Little Horst was not so sure. He spoke a few words of Sorb, telling me he had only one hour left to finish painting the Easter eggs, so he had to keep quiet and concentrate. Before he broke off, however, he said that, if I wanted to buy any of the eggs, they would cost DM1 (60 US cents) each. This he said in German.</p>

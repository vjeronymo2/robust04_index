			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / International Company News: Impala Platinum slips 16.5% to R260.3m IMPALA Platinum does not expect to improve on its 1991-92 annual results in the current financial year and has deferred its UG2 ore body expansion programme for a year, Reuter reports from Johannesburg. 'We are husbanding our resources,' said Mr Michael McMahon the managing director of the world's second biggest platinum producer, after reporting a 16.5 per cent fall in attributable income to R260.3m (Dollars 94.3m) in the year ended June 30, 1992, from R311.8m. A 38 per cent cut in the dividend for the full year to 170 cents reflected the lower profit in the past year and expected depressed conditions in the immediate future, he said. Mr McMahon said a remarkable turnround in second-half performance, contrary to the company's forecast at the halfway stage, was the result of reduced operating stocks and its programme to control costs and resolve the technical problems at its refinery. The company deferred its expansion at the UG2 ore body because of weakness in world prices for platinum group metals and a fall in demand.</p>

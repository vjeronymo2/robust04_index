			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Alexandra Schwartzbrodt: "Future Large Aircraft </F> Expected To Be Included in Military Programming Law"]    [Text] After long months of procrastination, the Defense  Ministry is said to have decided that the European FLA [Future  Large Aircraft] transport plane, currently at the feasibility  study stage, will be included in the 1995-2000 military  programming law. Given the election schedule, this decision does  not really commit the current authorities in that no financing  is needed in 1995. A few hundred million French francs [Fr]  will, however, be assigned to defining the aircraft's  specifications in 1996, with development planned in the second  half of the period covered by the law.    The aim of this move is to profit from the time lapse to  reduce the specifications as far as possible and thus reduce the  cost of the aircraft, and then to launch the program as part of  a Franco-German cooperation project within the scope of the  Airbus consortium. In this way, they hope to attract the  participation of Britain, which needs 60 such aircraft. This  project was agreed on in principle last weekend in Berlin by  General Arms Delegate Henri Conze and the head of the Joint  Chiefs-of-Staff, Jacques Lanxade, at a meeting with their German  counterparts, Joerg Schoenbohm and Klaus Naumann. They are also  said to have come to an agreement on lowering the cost of the  NH-90 European helicopter and, above all, on initiating a  process of closer Franco-German cooperation with regard to a  European antimissile defense program.    The launch of the FLA is considered by many French and  German  figures to be essential, starting with French Democratic  Union-Republican Party [UDF-PR] deputy for the Var region,  Arthur Paecht who, in a report published last February on the  subject, argued that a large part of Europe's aeronautics sector  depended on this aircraft being built. Moreover, it is no  coincidence that the Airbus consortium is being considered to  host the project. The aim is to feed the production chains that  are running out of steam and draw maximum benefit from the  experience built up in the civil domain in order to save on  costly development work. The FLA is, in addition, one of the  rare programs that make it possible to lay the foundations for a  real project for Franco-German cooperation and, over and above  that, to supply the joint agency set up by Henri Conze. While  the cost of the aircraft will be minimal between 1995 and 2000,  it may be likely to present a major financing problem at the  turn of the century, when FLA production will clash with the  delivery of and, above all, the payment for the Rafale fighter  aircraft. The recent decision by Euroflag, the European  consortium in charge of the project, to opt for a turboprop  aircraft will scarcely contribute to reducing its cost. There  is currently no suitable engine available "off the shelf," and  Europe will have to begin development of a new program.</p>

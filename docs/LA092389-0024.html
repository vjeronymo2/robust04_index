Waldman's  account of the Encino-Tarzana meeting on Aug. 17 with Councilman Marvin Braude.  </P> <P> Thank you, Los Angeles Times, for extending to DeAntonio the constitutional  rights which she so brazenly denied the citizens of Tarzana as president of the  Encino Hillside Traffic Safety Organization.  </P> <P> JEANNETTE VOGEL  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Following the French Government's decision to  intervene militarily in our country, the Rwandan Patriotic Front  [RPF] reaffirms its various declarations and informs national  and international opinion of the following:    1. The RPF recalls that the French Government supported by  diplomatic and financial means the dictatorial power in Kigali  which planned and implemented the genocide and massacres of  several hundred thousand Rwandans. The same French Government  through its instructors and intelligence agents trained and  armed the killer militias of the progovernment Republican  National Movement for Democracy and Development-Coalition for  the Defense of the Republic and the presidential guards who  perpetrated the massacres in April and May 1994.    2. The RPF recalls that during previous massacres French  troops operated closely with Rwandan troops who played an active  role in the same massacres in Bugesera, Bogogwe, Kibilira, and  Mutara. It also recalls that during the resumption of  hostilities in April, the French forces intervened only in order  to evacuate French and foreign nationals, abandoning a large  part of the Rwandan people to genocide and massacres. By taking  part in adopting resolution (?1918) of the Security Council,  France preferred to allow the continuation of the genocide and  criminal massacres, while hiding its so called humanitarian  rescue plan, which it reveals today.    3. The RPF recalls that France is a permanent member of the  Security Council and that it actively took part in defining and  implementing the intervention plan of UN Assistance Mission in  Rwanda-II [UNAMIR-II] which was adopted by the Security Council  on 16 May.    4. The RPF recognizes Resolution Number (?1918) which sets  up  the UNAMIR-II and will not recognize any other resolution, even  an intermediary one, which authorizes intervention in Rwanda by  French troops.    In view of France's past, the RPF believes that the new plan  for French intervention is indeed dangerous, as it is meant to  protect the killers of the Rwandan people. Therefore, the RPF  publicly condemns the new project of cynical and Machiavellian  intervention. It will oppose its implementation by all means.    The RPF once again invites the national community within the  country and in the Diaspora to mobilize to torpedo the French  plan, for which the Rwandan people may pay the cost.    Finally, the RPF urges the international community in  general  and African countries in particular to dissociate themselves  from the planned aggression against the Rwandan people. It asks  the Security Council to weigh the consequences which the French  aggression, even with the Security Council's agreement, may have  for the people of the subregion.</p>

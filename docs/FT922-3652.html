			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Majority of EC ministers oppose budget increase A MAJORITY of European Community finance ministers yesterday came out against an increase in the EC budget, widening the rift between rich and poor member states. Differences over the budget could dominate the Lisbon summit at the end of this month, increasing the pressure on the Community following last week's rejection of the Maastricht treaty by the Danish people. Seven countries, led by the UK and Germany, said yesterday they wanted to limit their budget contributions. Only Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland - which stand to benefit the most from an enlarged budget - backed the so-called Delors II package. Denmark did not take part in the discussion. Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, and his fellow commissioners are calling for an increase in the EC budget from Ecu66.6bn (Pounds 46.7bn) this year to Ecu87.5bn in 1997, at current prices. The budget row could have damaging effects in Ireland, which holds its referendum on Maastricht next week. Pro-Maastricht campaigners in the republic have made much of the financial benefits of closer union. Ministers yesterday reaffirmed their commitment to continued economic integration despite last week's Danish vote. But member states vary widely in their enthusiasm for the budget proposals. Richer member states want to limit their EC budget contribution to 1.2 per cent of gross national product while they strain to meet criteria for economic convergence imposed by the Maastricht treaty. They point out that EC spending does not match contributions even at current levels, but the Delors package proposes a gradual increase to 1.37 per cent of GNP by 1997. Mr Horst Kohler, Germany's deputy finance minister, said yesterday such an increase was unacceptable. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer, said the Delors proposals were not dead, but that there had been some very blunt talking. The finance ministers' conclusions will be submitted to foreign ministers for their meeting, also in Luxembourg, on Monday. Mr Kohler said before the debate that the budget should not be merely a list of the Commission's wishes for which cash had to be found. He said a failure to explain EC policymaking to the public might have been one reason for last week's Danish vote. Ministers also heard the tough judgments by the monetary committee of EC national treasury officials and the EC financial watchdog, the Court of Auditors. Mr Cees Maas, who heads the committee, told ministers 'cohesion' funds for poorer EC members should not be released until those nations had achieved strict economic convergence targets. EC finance ministers last night added harmonisation of indirect taxes to the list of topics that EC leaders will be asked to discuss during the Lisbon summit. They will come back to the measures at a special extra council of ministers on June 29, after EC leaders have glanced at them during the summit on June 26 and June 27.

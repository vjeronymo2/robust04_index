			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Business and the Law: Insurers lay claim to their policies - Robert Rice and Richard Lapper on a test case for intellectual property On January 5, B&amp;S Underwriters, a Louisiana-based insurance company, filed a lawsuit in the US District Court for West Louisiana that will provide the first test of copyright protection for insurance policies. The outcome of the case brought by B&amp;S against two US subsidiaries of Kansa Corporation, the Finnish insurance giant, will be watched by the insurance industry worldwide with great interest. Victory for B&amp;S could produce a torrent of litigation in the US as insurance companies seek to enforce intellectual property rights over insurance products that they have taken out with increasing frequency over the past decade in the struggle to gain competitive advantage in the multi-billion dollar US insurance market. According to B&amp;S's lawyer, Mr Peter Trzyna of the Chicago law firm Keck, Mahin &amp; Cate, 10 years ago there were less than 300 federally registered trademarks approved for insurance in the US. Today there are more than 1,200. There has been a similar rise in the number of copyright protections. From 1978 to 1981 there were only 1,500 copyright registrations relating to insurance forms; today there are more than 10,700. Some companies have also successfully obtained patent protection for computer support systems for insurance products and services. The driving force behind this trend is increased competition in the industry, he says. Insurance companies can no longer afford to spend millions of dollars developing and launching new products only to have them copied by competitors and sold against their own products in the marketplace. The increased willingness of US courts to recognise intellectual property rights over financial products, combined with a new awareness among insurance companies that intellectual property law provides a powerful tool for protecting their innovative ideas and products will have a profound impact on the insurance industry, he predicts. Those who infringe intellectual property rights risk destruction of all their infringing policies and damages running into millions of dollars. The increase in the number of insurance companies seeking intellectual property protection for their new products dates from the passing of the 1976 US Copyright Act. According to Mr Trzyna, before the Act came into force the courts proved very reluctant to uphold copyright protection for insurance forms. A number of insurance companies with copyrighted insurance forms sued companies that had allegedly copied their products and lost. The US courts adopted the doctrine that where an underlying idea could only be conveyed in a more or less stereotyped manner, duplicating it did not constitute copyright infringement even if there was word-for-word copying. Since the 1976 Act was passed, however, beefing up federal copyright law, there have been several cases where courts have found infringements of copyright in relation to other financial products. In 1982, in a case brought by Dow Jones, a court ruled that a list of stocks in an index was protected by copyright. In 1985 Merritt Forbes, a securities underwriter and marketer which had registered a copyright for its reoffering circulars and supplements for tax-exempt municipal bonds, successfully sued Newman Investment Securities and others for infringing the copyright by using substantially copied documents in an offering. To date, however, no court in the US has found an infringement of copyrighted insurance forms. The B&amp;S case involves an innovation in US workers' compensation insurance which B&amp;S claims to have pioneered by splitting a standard policy into two, allowing companies, such as life, accident and health insurance groups, not previously involved with workers compensation, to provide cover. B&amp;S registered copyrights for essentially every public document covering the innovation, including its policies, underwriting guidelines, advertising and even its filings with the state insurance commissioners. In addition it has six pending applications to register service marks used in connection with the product and it has filed a patent application for a computer system used to support the product and methods for making and using it. B&amp;S is not alone in combining intellectual property protections in this way to safeguard insurance innovations. The Chubb Corporation and its subsidiaries has at least one patent, 44 federal and 29 state trademark registrations and 150 copyright registrations. Lincoln National Insurance has one patent, 58 federal and 35 state trademark registrations and 89 registered copyrights. 'It took a great deal of effort and expense to create and launch our innovation and shepherd it through state regulators,' says Mr William Wolfe of B&amp;S. 'Like those in other industries, we have used intellectual property protections to safeguard our innovation and we have licensed the rights to market it. All we want is protection from those who would otherwise use our work without incurring the expense and risk of pioneering a new product.' The complaint against the Kansa subsidiaries, Clarendon National Insurance Company and Sterling Investors Life Insurance, is that, having entered into discussions with B&amp;S about the possibility of selling, in Louisiana, a standard workers' compensation policy that would complement the B&amp;S product, and having induced B&amp;S to reveal confidential information about its new product, Clarendon broke off negotiations and teamed up with Sterling to market competing policies based on B&amp;S's trade secrets and in breach of the B&amp;S copyrights. B&amp;S are claiming an injunction to prevent Clarendon and Sterling marketing their competing products, and are seeking destruction of all infringing policies, triple damages for wilful infringement and recovery of any profits resulting from the misappropriation of the B&amp;S product. According to another Keck partner, Mr Bruce Foudree, industry leaders will be watching this test case very closely. 'To promote creativity and innovation in the insurance industry, those who bring new products to the market must be protected,' he says. But judging by their reaction to news of the case, insurers in the London market are not expecting the controversy to spill over into either the UK market or the London market, a focus for much of the world's commercial insurance and reinsurance industry and traditionally a centre of innovation. 'It seems very odd. When we launch a new policy we assume it has a shelf life of only a few weeks,' said a spokesman for one of the large Anglo-American insurance brokers based in London. 'We assume we have six months before everybody else catches up.' Mr Alistair Gillies, a partner at City law firm Elborne Mitchell which specialises in insurance law, said there would be difficulties in asserting copyright over an insurance policy wording. 'As far as I am aware no one has ever tried to do it in the UK. It would be unlikely to happen here because of the difficulties in proving a wording was unique,' he said.</p>

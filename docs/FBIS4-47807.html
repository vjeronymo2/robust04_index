			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] reiterates its  position, that it cannot negotiate with a government of  criminals which continues to decimate a proportion of the  Rwandan population. If any RPF delegations go to Tanzania, (?it  is not) to hold any talks with the fictitious government, but  only to (?ask) President Ali Hassan Mwinyi for explanations  about the situation, which is making any contact with [words  indistinct] impossible.    In addition to this [words indistinct] Butrus Butrus-Ghali,  the UN secretary general, asking the UN Security Council to meet  in order to take a decision. Mr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali wants  foreign troops sent to Rwanda, however, not one European country  wants to release a single soldier, and the United Nations, which  fears another Somali-style experience, considers that the issue  should be dealt with by the OAU. [passage omitted]    Regarding OAU forces, the RPF's position remains crystal  clear: At this point, any intervention by foreign troops is  really useless. Whether they are UN or OAU forces, they are all  the more useless because genocide has already been committed.  It is too late, it is really insane, to hear the United Nations  pretending to be willing to send its troops in, when it has  withdrawn UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda [UNAMIR] troops while  huge numbers of Rwandans were being massacred in front of their  eyes. [passage omitted]    Everybody can remember the manner in which the UNAMIR Blue  Berets abandoned more than 2,000 people at (Kituitsiro)  Technical School, while these people were under their  protection, thus abandoning them to the barbarity of the  Presidential Guards and the Interahamwe [Republican National  Movement for Democracy and Development militias] militias, who  immediately massacred them. Whoever remembers this case -- and  we are mentioning only this specific case -- wonders what the UN  Security Council has in mind when it dares to suggest the  dispatch of foreign troops to Rwanda. Is it to protect hundreds  of thousands of corpses in a state of decomposition? Or to  protect old residential buildings? Why does the UN Security  Council not think of rescuing those who have escaped the  massacres but are still stranded in ravines, or those who are  dying a slow death at the Hotel des Mille Collines in Kigali,  dying from hunger, from thirst, from lack of medical care and  from lack of hygiene? [passage omitted]    The RPF believes that, if the international community  intends  to carry out any form of intervention in Rwanda, it should come  within the scope of humanitarian aid, notably food and health  aspects, given the famine and all its consequences which are  causing the death of those who have escaped the massacres and  the lack of medical care for the wounded as well as the threat  of epidemics due to the decomposition of corpses which are  littered throughout the country. It is in that framework that  international intervention is necessary, otherwise foreign armed  forces would have only been useful if deployed in time to  prevent the slaughter of such a large proportion of the  population. At the moment their intervention is useless. The  time for this has passed.</p>

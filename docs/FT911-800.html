			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Survey of Hong Kong (3): Airport plan is China gateway - Peking has forced delay on  HKDollars 100bn project AN ISOLATED island of a few houses, a school, and acres of banana plantations has become the focus of a major diplomatic confrontation with China. Called Chek Lap Kok, it lies off Hong Kong's large hilly island of Lantau and is the proposed site for the colony's new HKDollars 100bn (1990 prices) airport. But it all began quite differently, and with little controversy. The basic aim of the airport plan was - and is - economic: to enable Hong Kong to continue to act as the main entrepot, trading and transport centre for a large area of China by replacing the existing congested Kai Tak airport. 'The Hong Kong hinterland is roughly the same as Rotterdam's and involves serving about 200m people,' says Dr Ted Pryor, senior planner on the government's Port and Airport Development Strategy. This stretches far beyond Hong Kong's immediate Pearl River Delta area, with a population of 25m and the adjacent province of Guangdong, which has 65m people. In 1974, a HKDollars 5bn plan was drawn up by consultants to build at an airport at Chek Lap Kok, but it was shelved after years of procrastination in 1983 as too expensive. In 1986 Mr Gordon Wu, the extrovert and determined head of Hopewell Holdings, a Hong Kong-based construction and development company, sparked the government into fresh activity by putting forward a private sector-based scheme. Mr Wu had support from China and was backed by various large local companies including the Hutchison Whampoa and Cheung Kong Group controlled by Mr Li Ka-shing. But his plan was turned down by the government which launched its own HKDollars 127bn (at 1988 prices) PADS scheme in 1989, including a new airport at Chek Lap Kok to be opened in 1997, plus container port facilties to be built later. The need for a new airport is generally recognised and is accepted by China. Kai Tak is the sixth busiest airport in the world in terms of international passengers - 18.7m last year - and fourth in terms of freight, handling over 800,000 tonnes last year which was 9 per cent up on 1989. Its maximum annual capacity, with a current midnight to 6.30am curfew, is 24m passengers and 1.4m tonnes of cargo, and saturation point could be reached by the mid-1990s. Chek Lap Kok is designed to start with 28.6m passengers, using one runway, and grow to a maximum of 80m passengers and 4m tonnes of cargo using two runways round-the-clock. By 2011, planners estimate that Hong Kong will have 50m passengers and 2.6m tonnes of cargo. Consultants put the economic disbenefits of not building the new airport, through factors such as lost tourist traffic and business opportunities, at HKDollars 100bn by 2010. But the estimates do not take account of the impact of two other new airports nearby. Nor do they allow for a substantial reduction in the 5m Taiwanese a year who currently have to fly to China via Hong Kong because they are not allowed by their government to fly direct. There is immense pressure in Taiwan for this ban to be lifted. China is building a Yuan940m domestic airport at Huangtian in the special economic zone of Shenzhen - miles by sea from central Hong Kong. Chinese officials say it will open by the end of this year (with equipment to operate as an international airport) and that the first of its planned two runways will build up to 8m - 10m passengers and 185,000 tonnes of cargo a year. Hong Kong officials treat these claims with scepticism and put the passenger total nearer 3m. They say that even if China switched all its Hong Kong-China airline flights, Huangtian would only relieve Kai Tak of up to 10 per cent of its passengers and 16 per cent of its aircraft movements, delaying Kai Tak's saturation point for 12 - 18 months to mid-1995. On the western side of the Pearl Estuary (Hong Kong and Shenzhen are on the east), the Portugese enclave of Macao is building a HKDollars 3.5 - 4bn international single-runway airport which will also provide direct access to China's adjacent special economic zone of Zhuhai. It was scheduled to open in 1993 and originally was backed by China, but has run into trouble with Chinese officialdom. Macao's government says it is expected to handle 3m passengers within a couple of years of opening, but Hong Kong officials say they do not expect it to take any of Kai Tak's major airlines. The full potential of these two airports to ease Kai Tak's congestion has however never been assessed because Hong Kong has seen no reason to consult its neighbours, let alone make them partners. Its basic aim is to continue to dominate the region's airport business and provide a basis for the operations of Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways. It therefore does not want to dilute its international air traffic rights, which China has agreed should continue for 50 years after 1997.</p>

			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / A-Z of Personal Finance (27): Think hard before you lock it away - Zero-coupon securities ZERO-COUPON securities is a complicated description of a fairly simple concept. The term is a throw-back to the days when bonds came with interest coupons attached. Every six months or so, when interest was due, you clipped one off and posted it to the paying agent to receive your cash. Thus, a zero-coupon security has zero coupons and earns you zero cash during its lifetime. Instead, you get capital appreciation. This has two implications. The first is that, on zero-coupon equities, you have no tax liability until maturity. The second is that they shield investors against the so-called reinvestment risk when interest rates are falling. That means that you will not have to search fruitlessly for a high-yielding home for your investment cash flow in the middle of a recession. However, when interest rates are rising, the re-sale value of a zero-coupon bond will fall more sharply than those of other interest-paying securities. While they have their charms, zero-coupon securities are not without risks for the retail buyer. Indeed, the nature of these securities requires greater caution perhaps than other, simpler products. This is because it may not be obvious to the purchaser exactly what rate of return he can expect to earn; nor may it be obvious what charges are incurred in the purchase. Retail investors who purchase securities in the secondary market must be aware that the rate of return in the offering document may not be the one they receive. It can be higher or lower, depending on the price paid, and investors are at the mercy of their stockbrokers to calculate this accurately for them. Also, investors must ask whether the quoted yield to maturity is inclusive of transaction costs. Sales charges reduce yield to maturity by about 0.5 per cent a year. Zero-coupon bonds - typically, UK government gilts with the income stream removed - have been around for some time. The essence of a zero-coupon issue requires it to be sold at a deep discount to its face value, appreciating in value each year until its maturity date when it will be worth 100p in the pound to the holder. But according to Roderick Crawford, investment trust analyst at County NatWest Wood MacKenzie: 'You would have to be mad to buy one as a retail investor.' That is because holders must pay tax each year on the implied gain in the price of the bond, even though they have received no cash from it. Typically, only tax-exempt pension funds purchase these securities. Instead, retail investors who like the concept can pick and choose among a large number of so-called split-capital investment trusts, which offer zero-coupon preference shares as one class of security. 'These are taxed as equities, and there is considerable equity risk to them,' explains Roger Adams, analyst with SG Warburg Securities. Investors incur tax only when the shares are sold or when they mature, and then they are taxed as capital gains. Also, Mr Crawford points out, investors may 'index' the returns to inflation. Zero-coupon preference shares carry the chief characteristic of bonds - a fixed rate of return to maturity. Often, they are the highest ranking security, with investors having first claim on the investment trusts' assets in the event of failure. However, purchasers are warned to read the small print, to learn where they would stand in the creditors queue. Preference shares, says Mr Adams, offer returns of around 11 per cent annually, net of tax. But he warns that it is not enough for investors to look at yield to maturity: they must also look at 'cover', and gauge the ability of the fund manager to produce returns that grow sufficiently quickly. If cover is insufficient upon maturity, investors will get back less than was promised on issue. Among zero-coupon preference shares with the worst cover are those of Olim Convertible Trust, which in early February yielded 12.73 per cent to maturity, while its assets were only sufficient to cover 71 per cent of the preference shares' face value at maturity. The fund manager must earn returns of 4 per cent a year to cover preference shareholders, Mr Adams notes. At the other end of the scale, River Plate and General, was offering a yield to maturity in 1996 of 9.4 per cent, but the redemption value was covered 2.15 times by the assets of the trust.</p>

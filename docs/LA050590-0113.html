			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GORBACHEV IS STILL FULLY IN CHARGE, KEY ADVISER SAYS  </P> <P> Rejecting Western speculation that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is under  intense pressure from the Soviet military, one of his top advisers said Friday  that the country's political leadership is still fully in charge in the Kremlin  and that it remains committed to Gorbachev's reform program of perestroika.  </P> <P> Alexander N. Yakovlev, a member of the Communist Party's ruling Politburo,  dismissed as completely unfounded recent assertions by Bush Administration  officials in Washington and NATO analysts in Brussels that the Soviet army had  demanded policy changes from Gorbachev and apparently had forced him to retreat  in arms control negotiations.  </P> <P> "There is no basis for the claim that Gorbachev had to somehow change his  policies in response to (military) pressure," Yakovlev told a news conference.  "We do not see any grounds to suspect that our army is hatching some kind of  plans against the party, against the leadership. We do not believe this is the  case."  </P> <P> Yakovlev, reviewing the domestic political scene as well as Soviet foreign  policy, said that he wanted to calm widespread Western speculation that  portrays an embattled Gorbachev confronted with immense political and economic  problems at home and consequently under increasing military pressure not to  make concessions abroad.  </P> <P> While such speculation is common in advance of key Soviet-American meetings  such as the Soviet-American summit in Washington starting May 30, the current  round is being used to explain reported shifts in Moscow's positions in the  strategic arms reduction talks with Washington and the Vienna negotiations to  reduce conventional forces in Europe.  </P> <P> As read here, the implication in much of the Washington speculation is that  Gorbachev is not fully in charge, that the Soviet military might balk at the  agreements he makes and that, as a result, the United States and its partners  in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization should be cautious in making deals  with a man who might be gone tomorrow.  </P> <P> Also implied in this speculation is a Soviet responsibility should the  negotiations fail to produce agreements, once regarded as all but certain,  before the Washington summit.  </P> <P> Yakovlev specifically denied a NATO intelligence report, released in Brussels  on Thursday, that the Soviet military had mounted a show of force, reportedly  arming 6,000 cadets, during massive anti-government protests here in late  February as a warning to Gorbachev that it was ready to take over if political  instability increased.  </P> <P> "There were no movements of military personnel," Yakovlev said, "and no  pressure was applied to Comrade Gorbachev. No demands were made on the  government."  </P> <P> However, Yakovlev, the most prominent liberal in the Kremlin leadership, did  assert that "ultra-rightists," by which he appeared to mean a wide variety of  groups all along the country's political fringe, are working to bring Gorbachev  down and to destroy his political and economic reforms.  </P> <P> Commenting on the anti-government, anti-party demonstrations during the May Day  parade in Red Square on Tuesday, Yakovlev confirmed that Gorbachev and other  leaders, including himself, had left the reviewing stand because of the angry  protests directed at them.  </P> <P> "The leadership left the tribune and left it for political reasons, being very  strongly in disagreement with the ultra-right, conservative positions being  expressed by people who had come onto the square," Yakovlev said.  </P> <P> "My conviction is that this was an action by the ultra-right and those who  stand behind them. For us, with our difficult and tragic history, it is simply  impermissible to try to turn history back, which means to head into the abyss.  </P> <P> "I think that all the country's democrats, all normal, decent and  clear-thinking people . . . should be on their guard and see the very real  danger," he said.  </P> <P> Perestroika and its leaders are now under threat, Yakovlev added, from  extremist groups that he characterized as "ultra-right" -- though in Western  political terms they appear to be on the far left -- and as "conservative,"  though they are even more disdained by conservatives within the Communist  Party.  </P></p>

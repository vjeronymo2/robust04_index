The source is one of the rare Western figures who have free  access to Pyongyang and maintain close friendship with the  Pyongyang leadership.    "At a recent high-level meeting presided over personally by  Kim Il-song, North Korea reaffirmed their policy that they  cannot abandon their nuclear efforts unless there are clear  assurances from the United States for improved U.S.-North Korea  relations with the ultimate recognition of North Korea by the  United States, lift of the existing trade embargo and for  economic support," the source said.    The source, whose latest visit to Pyongyang was timed with  IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) inspectors' arrival in  Pyongyang early this month, said he obtained the information  from a ranking Pyongyang official with whom he has been on  friendly terms.    "It is feared therefore that unless these basic conditions  are met, tension could build up between South and North Korea  over the nuclear issue," the source said.    He said that the United States in effect applies a rigid  economic sanction against North Korea by limiting the amount of  dollars carried by Korean-resident visitors to North Korea and  banning trade with Pyongyang.    The source observed that it appears North Korea has turned  more intransigent as the international community's call for  thorough nuclear inspection had threatened to diminish chances  for the effective use of their "nuclear card."    Until a while ago, North Korea planned to announce a limited  opening if only there were a substantial progress in U.S.-North  Korea relations such as the exchange of liaison offices, he  added.</p>

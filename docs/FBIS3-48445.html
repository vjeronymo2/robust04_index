Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today says Japan's bid to  get the trust of the Asian nations is as ridiculous as a wolf  imitating the voice of the sheep.    The analyst says:    Asian nations heavily suffered from the Japanese  imperialists' aggression and occupation in the past, which left  deep scars on the hearts of their peoples. This is the cause of  their distrust in and caution against Japan. Their distrust and  caution are growing with the revival of militarism in Japan and  its moves to become a military power. The Asian peoples have  been told by top Japanese authorities more than once that Japan  would not be a military power. Japan, however, has escalated  arms buildup for the purpose of becoming a military power.    Japan's moves to become a military power is chiefly aimed at  realising with strength the design of "the greater east Asia  coprosperity sphere" it failed to fulfil in the past.    Japan's promise not to be a military power is a crafty ruse  to launch a military aggression by blunting the vigilance of the  Asian peoples.    If Japan truly wants to get their trust, it must actually  demonstrate its will of peace.    It must, first of all, slash military expenditures, cut back  armament, cancel overseas dispatch of troops and give up the  nuclear armament program. It must also fully liquidate its past  crimes and honestly discharge its obligation to make an apology  and compensation.    If Japan's promise to refrain from becoming a military power  is true, it must show it in practice.</p>

Union President Richard Trumka said the action takes the union "one step  closer" to voting on contract terms. It also sets up a showdown Monday in the  coal fields of southwest Virginia, where a county judge must decide whether to  set aside $64 million in fines levied against the union for civil disobedience  during the strike.  </P></p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report]  <H6>  THE STAR </H6>   Mandela's Mining Rights Remarks `Imprudent' -- Johannesburg  THE STAR in English on 11 February in a page-14 editorial  describes African National Congress (ANC) President Nelson  Mandela's remarks about the state reclaiming control of mineral  rights from the mining houses as "imprudent." "Whether this was  the intention or not, they revive fears of nationalisation and  State control of the economy, with the consequent risk of a  further flight of foreign capital." Mandela may have been  restating a controversial point in the ANC's Reconstruction and  Development Program (RDP), but "his tone was far from discreet."  "Mandela's speech is likely to negate the reassurances he made  after publication of the RDP, and also those given by the ANC  spokesman on mining, Paul Jourdan."  <H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>   Concern About Partisan Influence on Argus Editors --  "Journalists at THE STAR are apprehensive about what the change  of ownership of Argus Newspapers will bring," notes a page-14  editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 11  February. "Their apprehension testifies to their independence  under Anglo's ownership." The fact that Nelson Mandela has been  a house guest of Tony O'Reilly, chief executive of Ireland's  Independent Newspapers which acquired 31 percent of Argus  Newspapers, and "has O'Reilly's ear need not imply that partisan  influence will be exerted on the Argus's editors. Whether this  is so will surely become apparent in the run-up to April's  election and the early period of ANC rule." "The ANC's Pallo  Jordan was right when he said his party's aim was to attract  foreign investment, and that it could not be squeamish about  which sectors foreign investors targeted."  <H6>  SOWETAN </H6>   Country May Be Headed for Civil War -- "It is now certain  that the rightwing will boycott the elections," notes a page-8  editorial in Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 11 February.  "At worst we seem to be headed for a civil war. The rightwing  and its bedfellows in the Freedom Alliance will do everything to  thwart or make the elections difficult. The time has come for  Government to act decisively against these groups."  <H6>  WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN </H6>   PAC To Acquire Watchdog Role -- "In the new parliament it is  probably the Pan-Africanist Congress (PAC) and left-wing  elements of the ANC who will most vocally express popular  criticism of ANC leaders and their ability to deliver on the  promises," points out a page-12 editorial in Johannesburg WEEKLY  MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN in English for 11-17 February. "The major  divide of South African politics, post-election, will probably  be between the ANC and those on its left, notably the PAC,  rather than those on its right. Most black voters are likely to  see the PAC as the watchdog."    Sporadic Violence Likely From Right Wing -- A second  editorial says the major question on everyone's lips this week  is whether the likely nonparticipation of the Freedom Alliance  in the elections is the "beginning of a slippery slide towards  civil war." WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN believes a generalized  right-wing rebellion is unlikely. "The white right is too  isolated, too powerless, too divided and too poorly led for  full, open revolt." Instead, there may be "an increase in the  level of sporadic, targeted violence rather than more widespread  revolt. This could make the election ugly, violent and messy,  without necessarily preventing it from happening."</p>

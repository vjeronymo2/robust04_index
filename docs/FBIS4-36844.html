			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, June 11, IRNA -- Leader of Islamic  revolution Ayatollah 'Ali Khamene'i blamed those oil-producing  states who supported hegemonic powers rather than defending the  rights of their own countries and nations causing sharp fall in  oil prices.    Ayatollah Khamene'i made the remark in the oil-rich city of  Gachsaran Friday morning on the last day of his four-day tour of  Kohkiloyeh-Boyer Ahmad Province in southwestern Iran.    The leader also said that Iran was the only member of the  Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to  annnounce its stance and seriously insist on it.    Ayatollah Khamene'i said that the progress of arrogant  Europe  and America is based on oil which belongs to the Middle East,  Persian Gulf and other Muslim regions. If the Muslims stop the  export of their oil to the West, the industrial societies would  be reduced to lifeless shells, he added.    Ayatollah Khamene'i further noted that due to the treachery  of some of the regional allies of Europe and America, oil --the  backbone of industiral civilzaiton-- is sold at a very low price  so much so that the West's profit from oil imports and taxes is  much higher than what the producing countries gain through oil  exports.    Leader of the Islamic revolution said that the awakening of  the Muslim nations was the only remedy to the problems of the  Muslim world.</p>

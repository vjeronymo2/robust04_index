			<p><P> August 29, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Gone in an Instant: Singer Paul McCartney's Nov. 27-29 concert dates at the  Forum were near-instant sellouts Monday, so tickets were put on sale for two  additional dates: Nov. 23 (Thanksgiving) and Nov. 24. They immediately sold  out, too. A spokeswoman for the promoter, Parc Presentations, said no more  dates would be added to the engagement, which will be the tour's only Southern  California stop. McCartney's last local appearance was a three-night stand at  the Forum in June, 1976. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

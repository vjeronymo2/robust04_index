			<p>BFN     [Text] MAINICHI SHIMBUN conducted a survey on the next  general election through its nationwide communication network on  10 June. It asked members of the House of Representatives their  prediction on the schedule of the next general election and  under which electoral system -- the present multiple-seat  constituency system or the new system combining single-seat  constituencies and proportional representation -- they are  preparing for the election. Results of the survey show that  only a few respondents have ordered their local offices to  prepare for full-fledged election campaigns, assuming that there  will be "an election in the near future." Such a result shows  that both ruling and opposition party members have judged that  there is little possibility of a dissolution of the lower house  to conduct a general election after the passage of a motion of  no- confidence against the Hata Cabinet at the end of the  current Diet session. However, most Diet members who have  started preparations have been doing so for the multiple-seat  constituency system in order to be ready for early dissolution.  This result illuminates the Diet members' anxieties.    Lower house members or their staff in charge of local  offices  were surveyed from 1 to 7 June. Among questions asked in this  survey are: 1) have you put up posters or reserved halls to  hold rallies with a possible election in mind? 2) details of  orders given by Diet members to their offices; 3) under which  electoral system are you preparing, multiple-seat constituency,  or single seat constituency systems? 4) likely schedule of the  election; 5) in case of an election, under which electoral  system will the election be conducted?    With regard to the schedule of the election, one Diet member  (Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], from the third district of  Hokkaido) indicated his prediction that the election will be  conducted "in July under the multiple-seat constituency system."  However, an overwhelming majority of office staff said that they  have not been "informed by Diet members that an election will be  conducted in near future," (according to the office of a Japan  New Party member from the 11th district of Tokyo). Since the  possibility that the LDP will cooperate with the Social  Democratic Party of Japan in submitting a no-confidence motion  is diminishing, the prevailing view among Diet members  throughout Japan is that "the prospect of dissolution has become  remote." Thus, the level of tension in relation to a possible  election appears to have subsided in comparison to a recent  period.    Concerning preparations for the election, a majority said  they have been preparing for the "multiple-seat constituency" or  both "single and multiple-seat constituency systems." It seems  that the respondents have no other choice but to give priority  to preparing for election under the multiple-seat constituency  system because they must be ready for a possible Diet  dissolution, and also because redistricting of single-seat  constituencies has not been completed.</p>

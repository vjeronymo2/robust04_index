			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Bundeswehr Inspector Hartmut Bagger by Frank </F> E. Lippold; place and date not given: "The Gap Between the  Mandate and the Funds Is Widening More and More"]    [Text] [Lippold] You have taken over your new function as  army inspector at a time when the Bundeswehr is in a critical  political and financial situation. How do you assess the  situation?    [Bagger] Regarding the changed and increased spectrum of  tasks, I, as the inspector, want a broad political and social  consensus. In the past, it was also founded on basic military  questions in our country. It is a great psychical strain for  the affected soldiers and their families to identify themselves  -- for example, in Somalia -- with a mission and to take  personal risks, while uncompromising debates on the  constitutionality of this mission are held in public. The  Bundeswehr took over these new tasks and, at the same time, the  available financial means were repeatedly cut. The gap between  the mandate and the funds is widening more and more.    [Lippold] What can this lead to?    [Bagger] Effects can already be felt today in the training.  However, the long-term consequences will be more serious because  investment funds to modernize the army to the necessary extent  are lacking. I am concerned about that.    [Lippold] What are the most important tasks and objectives  of the new army structure?    [Bagger] The army must be able to fulfill tasks in the  complete sphere of future operations, which range from the  defense of Germany and its alliance partners to participation in  humanitarian measures and peace missions. These objectives were  implemented on the basis of resources in army Reform 5. The  capability to defend our country continues to be our supreme  objective. However, the security policy situation permits main  defense forces, which need not be completely operational, to be  used for this purpose in times of peace.    [Lippold] Who remains in a state of combat readiness?    [Bagger] About one-third of our forces are to be operational  and in a permanent state of combat readiness. After the  establishment of the constitutional prerequisites, they can be  employed for crisis management within the framework of NATO and  the Western European Union. Main defense forces and  crisis-reaction forces continue to be part of an "overall  system." When called to action, the army divisions should be  mainly assigned to the multinational corps, since security can  only be achieved through an alliance, as shown by our past.  Thus, integration within multinational structures is also a  characteristic of army Reform 5.    [Lippold] How can we prevent the development of a two-class  army, that is to say the existence of privileged crisis-reaction  forces and inferior troops for the defense of the country?    [Bagger] The term "two-class army" does not live up to my  idea of the future democratic structure of the army. It implies  a qualitative graduation. It is a fact that, in the future, we  will have crisis-reaction forces and main defense forces that  have to fulfill different tasks. Crisis-reaction forces must be  made available, put in a state of combat readiness at short  notice, and be highly mobile and flexible. Depending on  mobilization, part of the main defense forces can be employed  after an appropriate preparation period. The security policy  situation permits this.    [Lippold] The defense budget, too?    [Bagger] In view of tight budgetary constraints, we will  have to set priorities. These are now the crisis-reaction  forces because there is a greater demand for a follow-up on  their equipment and, according to the present assessment, the  probability of their employment is comparably high. We are  forced to make cuts in the main defense forces.    [Lippold] That is to say, there will be bipartition after  all?    [Bagger] The unity of the army must not be lost. A  qualitative differential between individual units that impairs  their functioning would jeopardize the functioning of the army.  As the person who is militarily responsible for the operational  readiness of the army, I insist on maintaining the compatibility  of crisis-reaction forces and main defense forces regarding the  regular exchange of personnel and appropriate equipment. It is  nothing new in the German army that we use weapons systems that  vary in their modernness.    [Lippold] What tasks from the "German Unity" program does  the army have to perform in the new laender?    [Bagger] The takeover of soldiers of the former National  People's Army into long-term service as military servicemen or  professional soldiers has been concluded. We are now trying to  provide the soldiers who have been taken over with the necessary  training that corresponds to their employment. The exchange  between west and east will further advance the process of  growing together. This growing together of people has to be  promoted further and followed up in case of need where required.    [Lippold] What about the environment?    [Bagger] A uniform standard is also to be provided for the  external framework, the barracks, and soldiers' apartments.  Priority was given to this intention in the plan on the  infrastructure. However, as a result of the repeated budget  cuts, the financial means to carry out the necessary  construction measures in time are lacking.    [Lippold] Your church grammar-school teachers reportedly  criticized your decision to become a soldier as "some kind of  recalcitrance on the part of a teenage lout." Do you think that  the soldier's profession and military service as a whole has to  be explained anew and socially upgraded?    [Bagger] The preservation of external security continues to  be a basic function of the state, independent of analyses of any  threats. For this task, every draftee continues to be  indispensable and will remain so in the future as well. We  certainly have to make people increasingly aware of the fact  that the defense of the country and the alliance has to be  carried out in the alliance area and not exclusively on German  soil. In this way, following the security policy change in  Europe, we are arriving at a situation in which the soldiers and  also draftees of our allies have been for a period of 30 years.  Again and again, military service has to be explained and  justified to those who are to assume this civic duty. The young  citizen should also do his duty in the increased spectrum of  tasks because he understands that this is necessary.    [Lippold] Who can bring this home to him?    [Bagger] This is a political and social task. There is a  pent-up demand in Germany. The Bundeswehr and the army are  prepared to do their share. However, we also ask for the  support of the parties and the public. Such an information and  learning process is necessary. All of us must understand what  it means to be a sovereign state and to be challenged -- in the  positive sense -- as a sovereign state in Europe and the world.</p>

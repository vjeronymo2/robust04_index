			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Brussels pressure grows over networks Mr Karel Van Miert, EU commissioner responsible for competition policy, said yesterday he was considering the use of special powers to force through the liberalisation of alternative telecommunications infrastructure, such as cable, energy and transport networks. His announcement followed the failure of EU industry ministers to support commission efforts to set a deadline by which member states would have to throw open their networks to competition. The decision reflects growing frustration within Brussels and certain member states at the slow pace in embracing new information technology. It is not yet clear that the commission will back Mr Van Miert's intention to use so-called Article 90 powers to force the shake-up, which would allow private operators to use alternative networks for the provision of services already open to competition. This does not include 'voice' telephony, which according to an earlier agreement, will not be opened up to competition until January 1, 1998. Yesterday Mr Van Miert said there was considerable support for the liberalisation of alternative networks from member states, even if significant differences remained over the liberalisation of traditional telephone networks, most of which remain under monopoly control. 'We will push ahead with alternative infrastructures,' said Mr Van Miert. 'The proposals will be on the table by the time of the next telecoms council meeting in November.' Earlier, backed by Germany and the UK, Mr Martin Bangemann, commissioner responsible for industry, failed to persuade member states that they should set a deadline by which all existing networks should be deregulated and private enterprises freed to build their own infrastructures. Ministers from certain countries, notably Belgium and Spain, said they did not want to discuss detail until the commission had presented a green paper on liberalisation of infrastructures, expected by the end of the year.</p>

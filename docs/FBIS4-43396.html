			<p>BFN     [Text] Felipe Gonzalez has ruled out early general  elections, and he does not think it is necessary to reshuffle  his cabinet. He said this in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia,  where the fourth Latin America summit closed last night. The  prime minister also said that he does not think there are enough  reasons at present to submit the goverment to a confidence vote  in the Cortes although he would be prepared to do so were it  necessary:    [Begin Gonzalez recording] I do not rule it out, but I am  not  giving an immediate response to that problem because it is not  an immediate problem. [end recording]    In statements made before starting his journey back to  Madrid, Gonzalez described a possible alliance with the United  Left as difficult, but said he is open to dialogue with the  Popular Party although with the following warning:    [Begin Gonzalez recording] Responsibility for government  will  belong to the government's under all circumstances. If the  government cannot discharge this responsibility then it will  have to make other decisions but what it will not to do is  abdicate its responsibility. [end recording]</p>

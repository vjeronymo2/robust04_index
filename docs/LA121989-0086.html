			<p><P> December 19, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA;  </P> <P> BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB CHANGES LOCATION  </P> <P> The Brea Boys and Girls Club Monday dedicated a new clubhouse, a temporary  building on a city-owned lot, which will be the club's home while a permanent  and larger clubhouse is being planned and built.  </P> <P> Founded in 1985, the club has been housed at Laurel Elementary School. Because  of building rehabilitation at the school, the club has been forced to move. The  new location is 502 S. Sievers Ave., next to the Brea Senior Citizens Center.  </P> <P> The Soroptimist Club of Brea will pay the lease on the temporary building,  owned by Founders National Bank, for four years. The bank has agreed to sell  the building to the Boys and Girls Club for $1 at the end of that time, said  executive director Dick Guthrie.  </P> <P> A total of 3,000 boys and girls belong to the La Habra-Brea Boys and Girls  Clubs, which has clubhouses at four sites. The overall budget for the clubs is  $400,000. Most of the funding comes from local sources, with 21% from the  United Way, Guthrie said.  </P> <P> Activities at the new site will include games, arts and crafts, sports, and a  variety of group activities. An after-school, day-care program operates from  2:15 to 8 p.m., Monday through Friday.  </P> <P> Discussions are under way with the Brea School District on the possibility of  constructing a permanent facility for the Brea Boys and Girls Club at Brea  Junior High. This could involve building a gymnasium and other facilities,  which would be shared by the district and the club, Guthrie said. DAVID F.  BURKE  </P></p>

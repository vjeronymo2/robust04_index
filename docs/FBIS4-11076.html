			<p>BFN     [Text] San Jose, 20 Apr (ACAN-EFE) -- Costa Rican  Presidency Minister Rolando Lacle today denied that relations  between his country and the United States suffered a serious  setback during the current administration, as various sectors  claim.    Lacle said that "we have enjoyed good relations" with the  United States, despite "certain discrepancies" following the  expropiation of a farm in northern Costa Rica from a U.S.  citizen who asked that the United States apply sanctions against  Costa Rica. This sanction aimed freezing a $250 million IDB  loan at the beginning of 1993, an idea that was finally vetoed  in Costa Rica's favor following intense diplomatic efforts by  San Jose.    The Santa Elena Hacienda, comprised of 15,000 hectares, is  now part of a national park bordering Nicaragua. The property  is claimed by John Hamilton. By mutual consent the case has  been submitted to international arbitration in order to  establish its true value 15 years after its confiscation.    Another incident that created tension between Costa Rica and  the United States was a claim by U.S. trade unions about alleged  labor right violations by Costa Rican authorities. Following  negotiations, Costa Rica managed to have the charges dropped,  which had been filed with the U.S. commerce secretary. In  exchange, Costa Rica promised to support a series of labor  reforms, some of which are still being discussed by the  Legislative Assembly, where they face strong opposition from  certain deputies and chambers of commerce.    The Costa Rican Government, headed by Social Christian  Rafael  Angel Calderon, ends its tenure on 8 May when Social Democrat  Jose Maria Figueres takes office. Today, Figueres ends a visit  to the United States where he has met with authorities.</p>

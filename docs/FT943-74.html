			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: VSEL alert Nuclear submarine contractor VSEL soared 225 to 1,228p after its admission that it had received a takeover approach. Traders pinpointed British Aerospace and GEC as the bid frontrunners, and the talk in the market suggested that a full blown auction could well be in the offing. If the consensus among analysts is any guide, any possible opening bid could be an all-share offer of around 1,350p a share. Both potential bidders found ready sellers, with BAe tumbling 15 to 449p and GEC dipping 4 to 289p. Vosper Thornycroft, another maritime defence contractor, shared in the excitement, moving up 23 to 720p.</p>

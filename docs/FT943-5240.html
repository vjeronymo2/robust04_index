			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / The Markets: Cocoa pact talks to resume - Commodities Cocoa Producers and consumers will on Thursday begin a fresh attempt to agree rules covering a production management deal that was implemented in February. Members of the International Cocoa Organisation (ICCO) failed to reach agreement in June, when consumers complained that their views were not adequately represented on the organisation's production committee. The International Cocoa Agreement, which is operated by the ICCO, has adopted production management and consumption promotion in place of its buffer stock price stabilisation scheme, which has been moribund for some years. This month's session, which is to continue until September 20, will comprise meetings of the full ICCO council, as well as the production, consumption and executive committees. Some of the urgency was taken out of the revival of the cocoa pact by last autumn's price rally, with expectations of more to come as reduced production in West Africa and other areas (a legacy of historic low prices) promised a drawdown from world stocks. Prices have become stuck in something of a rut this summer, but remain some 35 per cent above the level of the summer of 1993. Nevertheless, producing members of the ICCO are keen to have some working machinery in place to counter any later market setbacks. Some have suggested that if some satisfactory arrangement cannot be reached under the auspices of the ICCO, then producers might do worse than to emulate the coffee producers' successful export retention scheme, which had helped to lift prices even before June/July frosts in Brazil drove them to 8 1/2-year highs. Other events this week include a three-day Indian planters' meeting in Coonoor to assess crop prospects for tea, coffee, rubber and spices, and a four-day international oils and fats conference in Kuala Lumpur. On Wednesday Statistics Canada is due to release its grain stocks report.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Gao Jin'an: "Copyright Gets More Protection"] </F>   [Text] In a fresh move to further protect the rights and  interests of overseas copyright owners, China is to implement a  copyright certification system for audio and video products.    Under the system, foreign agencies will be asked to provide  copyright certificates for audio and video products which are to  be distributed and shown in China.    Wang Huapeng, director of the Copyright Department under the  National Copyright Administration (NCA), said that the new  system will help to protect overseas copyright owners while  checking piracy.    The Motion Picture Industiy Association (MPIA) of Hong Kong  became the first agency to be entrusted to provide copyright  certificates for Hong Kong videos and laser discs which are to  be introduced into the mainland market.    A memorandum on copyright certification between the NCA and  MPIA of Hong Kong was signed yesterday in Beijing, marking the  first step for the implementation of the certification system.    Gao Linghan, a senior official from the NCA, disclosed that  the administration is now contacting and negotiating with the  London-based International Federation of the Phonograph Industry  and two American associations for copyright certification.    After the signing ceremony, Crucindo Hung, chairman of the  MPIA, said that member companies of his association produce over  90 per cent of home videos in Hong Kong each year, and a large  number of them are likely to be popular on the mainland.    Hung hopes that his association's co-operation with the NCA  will be further expanded.    The MPLA was founded in 1986 and it now has 150 member  companies in the territory.    In the past years, Chinese audio and video companies have  found it difficult to identify the copyright owners of overseas  products. Some foreign crooks took the opportunity to cheat  Chinese companies, thus putting them at risk of copyright  infringement.    China implemented its Copyright Law in 1991, placing all  copyrights under legal protection.    The country joined the World Intellectual Property  Organization in 1980 and became a signatory of three more  conventions in 1993, namely the Berne Convention for the  Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, the Universal  Copyright Convention and the Convention for the Protection of  Producers of Phonograms against Unauthorized Duplication of  Their Phonograms in 1993.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Ratemaking Principles <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The above-stated policies, as set forth by statute and more fully developed by OMB and the Department, comport with reasonable standards for user charges and are strongly supported by the prescriptions of economic experts with widely recognized credentials in the field of ratemaking policy. Any other approach would burden taxpayers with costs that can be traced directly to the needs of specific individuals, not to society at large. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One of many similar statements on cost of service as a basic standard of reasonableness is stated as follows in the authoritative text by Bonbright, Danielsen, and Kamerschen: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> No writer whose views on public utility rates command respect purports to find a single yardstick by sole reference to which rates may be judged reasonable or socially desirable as distinguished from rates that are unreasonable or adverse to the public interest. A complex of tests of acceptability is required just as would be the case with the tests of a good automobile, a good income-tax law, or a good poem. Nevertheless, one standard of reasonable rates can fairly be said to outrank all others in the importance attached to it by experts and public opinion alike_the standard of costs of service, often qualified by the stipulation that the relevant cost is necessary, true (i.e., private and social) cost or cost reasonably or prudently incurred.*&blank;*&blank;* <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A cost standard of ratemaking has been most generally accepted in the regulation of the levels of rates charged by private utility companies. But even more significant is the widespread adherence to cost, or to some approximation of cost, as a basis of ratemaking under public ownership*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;* <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Bonbright, Danielsen, and Kamerschen, Principles of Public Utility Rates, Public Utilities Reports, Inc., Arlington, Va., 2nd ed. 1988, pp. 109&hyph;110. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While the foregoing reference is extracted from a discussion of public utility rates, the rate standard cited also is applicable to other pricing situations that require cost recovery in a fair and reasonable manner. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Examinations Fee Account <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section describes the major programs funded by the Examinations Fee Account. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Adjudications and Naturalization Program <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The function of this program is to process, adjudicate, and ultimately grant or deny applications and petitions for benefits provided under the immigration laws of the United States. Adjudications activities include processing applications for permanent resident status, petitions for relatives, temporary and permanent worker petitions, reentry permits, refugee travel documents, extensions of temporary stay, employment authorizations, and temporary protected status. Naturalization activities include the examination of aliens to determine their qualifications for naturalization, administration of the oath for citizenship, and issuance of citizenship documents. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Refugees and Overseas Program <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The function of this program is to adjudicate refugee and asylum applications, conduct investigations for preference and relative visa petitions, and conduct other records checks and background investigations as are required at overseas INS offices. Officers assigned to this program also provide assistance to citizens and lawful permanent residents abroad regarding adoptions, immigration, or parole of alien spouses and children, and other benefits under the Immigration and Nationality Act. They also review requests for the Attorney General to grant humanitarian parole into the United States for deserving persons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

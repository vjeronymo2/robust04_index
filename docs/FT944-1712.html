			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Swelling hubbub over Heathrow: Michael Skapinker analyses the debate over plans for a fifth terminal at the UK airport Mr Des Wilson, veteran campaigner for worthy causes, will this morning brave the ire of environmentalists by presenting the case for a fifth terminal at London's Heathrow airport. Mr Wilson, who earlier this year became public affairs director of BAA, the airports group that owns Heathrow, will be backing up Sir John Egan, BAA's chief executive, and Sir Richard Rogers, the architect of the proposed Pounds 900m terminal. They will unveil at a press conference the detailed submission they intend to make to what is expected to be one of the biggest public inquiries in the south-east of England. The Department of the Environment says it has already received 5,000 letters about the proposed terminal, 95 per cent of which are hostile. As many as 3,000 of the objectors intend to address the inquiry when it starts next May. The Airports Policy Consortium, representing 30 south of England local authorities of all political persuasions, will argue that the terminal should not be built. The objectors argue that Heathrow, which already handles 51m passengers a year, cannot grow any further without inflicting serious damage on the communities that live around it. The fifth terminal would increase the airport's capacity to 80m. Mr Dermot Cox, a committee member of the Heathrow Association for the Control of Airport Noise, a pressure group, says: 'Terminal Five sounds like just another terminal. It isn't. It's a whole new airport.' Given the strength of feeling against the proposed terminal, BAA's recruitment of the New Zealand-born Mr Wilson is a significant coup. The former campaign director of the UK Liberal Democrats founded Shelter, which champions the homeless, led the Campaign for Lead-Free Air, chaired the UK branch of the Friends of the Earth and is the author of books such as Pressure, the A to Z of Campaigning in Britain. He says he is entirely comfortable in his new role. 'Very few major projects involve as little environmental impact as this one,' he says. The terminal will be built on land mostly occupied by a sludge works between Heathrow's two main runways. Access to the terminal will be via a new station connected to the London Underground network, the proposed Heathrow Express rail link and a spur road from the M25 motorway. The M25 will not have to be widened to accommodate the additional traffic, BAA says. With new rail links, it adds, 45 per cent of travellers to and from Heathrow will use public transport by 2016, compared with 36 per cent today. BAA insists that there will be no increase in night flights if the new terminal is built. Nor will the group need to build a third runway to handle the increased air traffic. With a rise in the average number of passengers per aircraft, BAA says Heathrow's two existing runways can handle the increase in flights expected in future years. The company says it needs the terminal to maintain Heathrow's position as the world's leading international airport, which in turn underpins London's position as one of the most important financial and business centres. BAA expects passenger demand at Heathrow to grow by 3-4 per cent a year for the foreseeable future. If Heathrow fails to accommodate this growing demand, ambitious airports such as Frankfurt, Charles de Gaulle in Paris and Amsterdam's Schiphol will do so instead. The Airports Policy Consortium rejects these arguments. Miss Frances Rudd, its planning officer, says: 'With or without Terminal Five, Heathrow is still the world's leading international airport. I remain unconvinced that if Heathrow doesn't get Terminal Five, London will decline.' Instead of trying to accommodate ever-increasing demand on the congested west side of London, the consortium believes BAA should be promoting development to the east of the capital, which, it argues, is in line with government policy for regenerating the East Thames corridor. The consortium says that, instead of building Terminal Five, BAA should promote the development of Stansted airport in Essex, which has good rail links to the City of London. In contrast to the bustle at Heathrow, Stansted appears eerily empty, with only 3.2m passengers a year. For the anti-noise campaign, Mr Cox, a market researcher who has lived near Heathrow since he was a child, says that he does not see how the airport can operate the fifth terminal without a third runway. The existing runways are already heavily utilised. According to Mr Cox, BAA's argument that it can handle the additional traffic using just two runways appears to be based on a firm conviction that larger aircraft will be built over the next few years. 'Their case is that we are going to have these super Jumbos taking 600 or 800 people. But they don't exist. People are talking about it, but it is still very hazy,' he says. Mr Cox says that, even with the current level of aircraft traffic, life is difficult for those who live near Heathrow. He concedes that people who choose to live near an international airport must expect a certain amount of noise, but he argues that they should not have to suffer being woken at 4am by overhead flights. Mr Cox says walks in Kew Gardens, a favourite haunt of his, are ruined by the sound of aircraft. 'Kew Gardens advertises itself as a haven of peace and tranquillity. If I wasn't a friend of Kew Gardens, I would refer them to the Advertising Standards Authority,' he says. Mr Wilson counters that making greater use of Stansted or London's Gatwick airport would not reduce the need for Terminal Five. Even if Stansted and Gatwick were used to full capacity, there would still be excess demand from airlines wanting to fly into London. In any event, Mr Wilson argues, 30 per cent of Heathrow's passengers use the airport to change to other aircraft. If these transfer passengers were denied the use of Heathrow, many would not use Stansted. They would change flights in Paris, Frankfurt or Amsterdam, he says. However hard BAA markets Stansted or Gatwick, international air passengers insist on using Heathrow. 'Heathrow has a choice of airlines, flights and destinations unmatched anywhere in the world. We are simply reflecting what the industry wants,' he says. BAA also rejects the view that new, large aircraft are essential if Terminal Five is to operate without a third runway. Aircraft using Heathrow currently carry an average of 126 passengers each and use the two runways to 82 per cent of their capacity. If by 2016, with Terminal Five built, the two runways are used to 92 per cent of their capacity, aircraft will have to carry 177 passengers per aircraft. A Boeing 747-400 already carries 400. BAA says that the number of Heathrow neighbourhoods affected by noise has been falling, because newer aircraft are quieter. In 1978, 1.5m people were affected by high levels of noise. Today, the figure is 500,000. By 2016, the figure will fall to 225,000 if Terminal Five is not built, and 293,000 if it is. Today Mr Wilson will present an opinion poll showing that over half the residents near Heathrow support Terminal Five and that they are more worried by traffic, litter and crime than by aircraft noise. He says: 'We will show that 73 per cent of people within a 5-mile radius of Heathrow haven't been woken once by aircraft noise in the past year.' The anti-Terminal Five campaigners will no doubt point out that BAA's figures mean that more than one in four people living near Heathrow have been woken by low-flying aircraft over the past year. Mr Wilson accepts that BAA's opponents have genuine concerns. In the end, however, the government will have to make a choice based on the interests of the UK and London, he says. 'It's a test of whether this country is capable of taking long-term decisions or whether short-term responses to a minority will prevail.'</p>

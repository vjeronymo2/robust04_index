			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] We start this newscast with Benin where all  government offices have been paralyzed since this morning -- the  first day of a renewable 72-hour general strike. The action was  launched by 10 of the country's labor union federations which  are demanding a minimum salary increase of 30 percent to  compensate for the loss of purchasing power following the  devaluation of the CFA franc. The strike is said to be 75  percent effective, and is taking place in an atmosphere of  absolute calm. From Cotonou, Ange-Hermann Gname reports.    [Begin Gname recording] Government offices, schools, customs  offices, the main post office, and some parastatal offices have  complied with the 72-hour strike order issued by the Federation  of Beninese Workers' Unions, and have done so in absolute calm.  This morning, the few workers who turned up at their workplaces  either went to provide minimum services or to see for themselves  the absence of their colleagues from work. Since this morning,  the national radio has only been broadcasting a very light  program which has not exceeded two and a half hours of air time.  Policemen have been guarding the deserted government offices  against any possible acts of vandalism. The Agency for Air  Navigation Safety in Africa and Madagascar has also joined the  strike and there was no movement of planes this morning at the  Cotonou International Aiport. Only a minimum service permitted  the flight by a Nigerian military aircraft of President  Nicephore Soglo -- chairman of the Economic Community of West  African States -- to Liberia, where he is supposed to chair the  inauguration ceremony of the new democratic institutions in  Monrovia today.    As we can see, the strike order has been well followed by  the  workers at a time when the Cotonou government is having a lot of  difficulty in easing the social tension which has worsened since  the devaluation of the CFA franc.

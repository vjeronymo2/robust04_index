			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Observer: Going down Bad news about Wall Street, I fear. GRE Asset Management reports that one of its most sophisticated technical indicators - its pile of US new issue prospectuses - has collapsed. The rule of thumb is that if the pile gets so high that it falls over of its own accord, the US market is over-valued. The pile has looked pretty unstable before now but this is the first time it has fallen over. 'No one was near it; it just went,' reports a frightened GRE fund manager.</p>

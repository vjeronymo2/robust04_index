			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Haiti: a theatre of the absurd IN the confusion spawned by the compromise intended to return constitutional government and ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to Haiti, there are a few things that are clear. One is that the agreement as it is, even if it results in Mr Aristide's physical presence in Haiti, will not achieve its objective. In a weekend statement, widely held to be at the instigation of the military which effectively runs the country, Mr Joseph Norette, the army-appointed president, said he will not step aside for Mr Aristide, and that Haiti's constitution demands that he hands over to a newly elected president. Legislators opposed to Mr Aristide have blocked the ratification of the conditions for his return. By any measure, the agreement is flawed, but it could even realise the opposite of its intended end by formalising the coup which overthrew Mr Aristide, leaving the Caribbean state under the effective control of the military and the president with only the trappings of power. The agreement proposes that: the Haitian legislature ratify the appointment of Mr Rene Theodore as prime minister; Mr Aristide and the prime minister meet fortnightly to assess the progress of efforts to create a climate for the president's return; an amnesty be granted to all involved in the coup; all decisions taken by the Haitian legislature be honoured; the Organisation of American States (OAS) lift a trade embargo on Haiti. The pact does have some value, although not directly to Haiti. Since the coup at the end of September, when Mr Aristide was sent into exile, the OAS has been working for Mr Aristide's return. It imposed a trade embargo and sought, with little success, to force the military backed government to accept the former president. The embargo was a failure. While it effectively killed Haiti's fledgling light industrial sector by forcing factories to close, sporadic shipments of fuel - with which some OAS members were linked - kept the country going. More significant was the increased volume of trade across the border with the Dominican Republic, and from which the Dominican military made fat profits. Brokering this latest agreement has allowed the OAS to save face. It has also been of some assistance to the US which, at times, appeared to waver in its support for Mr Aristide, and was being attacked for its decision to return thousands of Haitians seeking asylum. The pact could give the impression that the situation in Haiti will soon be normal, and that there is, consequently, little reason for Haitians to flee. Mr Aristide has not helped by fomenting confusion over one of the more sensitive aspects of the compromise. As far as Haitian legislators and Mr Theodore are concerned, the agreement with Mr Aristide protects the current status of the military leaders, allowing an amnesty for all involved in the coup, except for 'common criminals'. Yet Mr Aristide has subsequently argued that General Raoul Cedras, the leader of the military, will be punished for his part in the affair. The president has promised, however, that Gen Cedras will be given a chance to present arguments 'as to why his punishment should be lessened'. All this is unlikely to mollify an army which, at heart, does not want Mr Aristide to return, and which wishes to hang on to effective control of the country and resume its highly lucrative activities such as the transhipment of narcotics from South America to North America. Mr Aristide's mere presence in the presidential palace would not effectively alter Gen Cedras' control of the country and the likely crusades by the president's supporters to redress the situation will have a bloody end. This explains the value - to the OAS, to Haiti's legislators and to Gen Cedras, but not to Mr Aristide - in the open-ended clause concerning the timing of the president's return. Clearly, he cannot return in a climate of tension and uncertainty, and with the military objecting. According to Mr Jean Casimir, Haiti's ambassador to the US, an immediate return by Mr Aristide would be 'suicidal'. Mr Michel Francois, the police chief who operates with apparent independence from the military (the police is commanded by the military) has already let it be known that he would be unhappy with Mr Aristide's reoccupation of the presidential palace. It is not inconceivable that a few well-timed incidents could indefinitely delay Mr Aristide's return. Aware, perhaps, that he and the army which overthrew him cannot live in the same house, Mr Aristide may now be rethinking that part of the agreement which promises to leave Gen Cedras and his lieutenants untouched. Yet the army will not voluntarily concede to a man who has said that its leaders must be punished. While inside or outside of Haiti, the president and the current military leaders will continue at daggers drawn. Respecting the decisions of the parliament taken in his absence  - including the wholesale release at Christmas of members of the 'tontons macoute', the feared praetorian guard of the Duvalier dynasty which was overthrown in a popular revolt six years ago - could leave Mr Aristide in a theatre of the absurd.</p>

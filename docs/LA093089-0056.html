			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OBJECTIONABLE DIALOGUE  </P> <P> On Sept. 16, I watched the debut of "Sister Kate," and as the priest of St.  Thomas' Episcopal Church in Hacienda Heights, I must object to some of the  dialogue: After Sister Kate had just rescued one of her female orphans from an  apparent "date-rape" by an arrogant and wealthy male socialite, the nun  consoled the young woman by dismissing the young man as someone "who's probably  an Episcopalian."  </P> <P> I challenge KNBC for promoting such stereotyping of Episcopalians or of any  other religious or ethnic group. It indeed surprises me that such a line could  slip by in a time when most are trying to show greater sensitivity toward  minorities of all kinds. To see how this one might sound to us Episcopalians, I  invite you to substitute the name of your own favorite grouping into the above  situation.  </P> <P> DEAN FARRAR  </P> <P> Hacienda Heights  </P></p>

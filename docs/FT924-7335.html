			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Harmony rebels accuse directors of concealing group's true performance HARMONY LEISURE, the public house group at the centre of a shareholder battle for boardroom control, yesterday announced interim losses of Pounds 344,000 pre-tax on turnover of Pounds 3.09m. The company blamed the losses for the six months to September 27, which compared with profits of Pounds 445,000 on turnover of Pounds 3.81m, on higher net interest charges - up from Pounds 239,000 to Pounds 248,000  - and depreciation of assets. Rebel shareholders hoping to oust the executive directors accused the company of putting up a smokescreen on its true performance. They claimed losses had been reduced only because the company had sold several public houses to offset interest charges. 'On this theory, they would be pleased to have no turn over because it would mean no losses,' said Mr Andrew Martyr, leader of the rebel group. Harmony, however, denied that the sale of two of its sites was reflected in the half year figures. Mr Stanley Lever, managing director, said the company was making progress in cutting administration expenses and operating losses - down to Pounds 96,000 from Pounds 210,000 last year. The annual accounts to March 29 were qualified after Barclays, concerned at the level of borrowings, insisted on a substantial loan repayment in January next year.</p>

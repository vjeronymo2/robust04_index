			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / UK's gin drinkers prefer the hard stuff It seems the British gin-and-tonic drinker knows what's what. When some UK distillers sought to improve their margins last year by watering down the strength of their domestic gins from 40 to 37.5 per cent alcohol by volume, Allied-Lyons stuck to its guns. It maintained the full strength of its Beefeater brand. The dilution saved competitors like Guinness, which produces the market leader, Gordon's, about 34p a bottle, or Pounds 4.16 a case in excise duty. Most other gins, including Gilbey's, White Satin and Booth's, followed suit. But some G&amp;T drinkers, who are estimated to account for about 70 per cent of gin bought in the UK, decided to stick with the hard stuff. Beefeater's volume sales have jumped by 25 per cent, despite its premium price. Its market share increased last year from 5.6 per cent to 6.6 per cent, while Gordon's share slipped from 48 to 47 per cent. The overall market fell by 4 per cent.

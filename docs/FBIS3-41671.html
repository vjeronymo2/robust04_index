			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed answer to reader's inquiry about the </F> epidemiological situation in Russia]    [Text] As was reported to us in the Russian Federation  State Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight, the  situation regarding especially acute infections in the republic  is normal albeit rather tense. There are still no cases of  plague. The situation regarding cholera is more complicated. It  is generally brought in from abroad: In 1990, 49 patients came  in from Syria, and in 1992, 5 patients came in from India. And  this year, 17 patients and carriers of the virus have already  been registered in Makhachkala, Nizhniy Novgorod, Krasnodar, and  Naberezhnyye Chelny. And 2 cases of cholera disease from local  sources have been noted in Dagestan and Moscow.    The possibility of outbreaks of acute infectious diseases  remains because there are no real boundaries between Russia and  the former republics of the USSR and penetration of patients  from them is possible. The Russian Federation's law regarding  protecting its territories from the import and spread of  especially dangerous infectious diseases of people, animals, and  plants and the plan for such a federal program are still in the  development stage.    Overall, the situation regarding morbidity due to acute  intestinal infections in Russia remains complicated. Up to 1  million cases of disease due to acute intestinal infections are  registered each year because the public is not adequately  supplied with good-quality drinking water and foodstuffs. The  situation is especially serious in Russia's southern oblasts. As  the Rostov Oblast Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight told us,  four cases of hemorrhagic fever have been discovered in the  area, and two patients have died. In half a year, 93 diptheria  patient were hospitalized in the Rostov Oblast (3 died), there  have already been several outbreaks of diptheria, and the number  of brucellosis patients has increased by a factor of 5. Everyone  has long known how to guard against infectious diseases. Wash  your hands before eating, do not drink untreated water, do not  eat unwashed fruits...</p>

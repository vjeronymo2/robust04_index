			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Fiat falls 5.1% after rights issue announcement FIAT's rights issue weighed heavily on Italian equities, writes Our Markets Staff. MILAN demonstrated its displeasure with Fiat's record cash raising package, marking the shares down by 5.1 per cent. The Comit index shed 8.74 or 1.5 per cent to 593.98 as selling widened to envelop many of the blue chip issues. Although long rumoured, the Fiat rights issue still took many analysts by surprise. They had expected the group to wait until next year, after the launch of some important new models. It fell L302 to L5,598 in heavy volume of 24m shares. Rinascente, the retail group, remained suspended: Fiat is to offer its 58 per cent stake to shareholders. Fiat's financial services company, Ifil, which is to launch its own public offer for Rinascente, was also suspended yesterday. Mr John Stewart, of InterEuropa, in Milan said that the market's response would have been more positive if Rinascente had been sold outside the group. He said that the entire package would improve significantly Fiat's net debt position, improving the prospects for eventual recovery, although he cautioned that sales in a sluggish car market next year still posed a major problem for the company. Among companies which are to participate in a syndicate of Fiat investors, Generali, the insurer, shed L1,090 to L39,250 and Mediobanca, the merchant bank, fell L210 to L15,600. Mr Nicolo Braendli of Akros Sim in Milan believed that the rights issue alone accounted for yesterday's fall in the Fiat share price and that the market would remain volatile as investors turned their attention to the group's much higher than expected L966bn first half pretax loss. Mr Bob Barber of James Capel in London commented: 'The size of the rights issue, the extent of the losses and disappointment that Fiat has not found an external buyer for Rinascente suggest to us that the share could fall to L5,000 in the cum rights form.' FRANKFURT saw strength in insurers, and weakness in steels and engineers as the broad market continued to drift, and the DAX index closed 5.92 lower at 1,907.69. Among insurers, Allianz saw a reiterated buy recommendation from Vereins-und Westbank, which added a likely improvement in underwriting losses and a growing demand for insurance products to the recent downtrend in interest rates. The shares eased only DM1 to DM2,554, and showed a small gain on the day in the post-bourse. However, the highly capitalised, but relatively illiquid AMB and Munich Re continued to star in share price terms, with gains of DM40 to DM1,300, and DM50 to DM3,250 respectively. At the heavy end of the economy, the metal employers' cancellation of wage contracts was seen as an abrasive move. Deutsche Babcock fell by another DM3 to DM185.50, Metallgesellschaft by DM6 to DM348 and Mannesmann, already weakened by its rights issue, by DM4.30 more to DM305.50. PARIS continued to mark time and the CAC-40 index settled slightly higher, up 6.83 at 2,126.80. There was some activity among non-CAC-40 stocks with Eridania Beghin-Say gaining FFr21 to FFr816 after its announcement late on Tuesday that it was interested in acquiring Bertolli, the Italian olive oil producer. Bic, the pen and razor manufacturer, lost FFr89 or 6.7 per cent to FFr1,236, reflecting disappointment with its first half results, which also came out after trading closed on Tuesday. There was renewed confusion over the timetabling of BNP's privatisation after a report in the local media that the date had been set for next week was denied by the government. A finance ministry official reiterated that the public sale of the 40 per cent stake would take place before Christmas. The bank's CIs shed FFr5.80 to FFr277. MADRID's general index eased 0.15 to 286.62 but Acerinox, the stainless steel company, recovered Pta290 to Pta9,290 after losing Pta400 in heavy volume on Tuesday. Between 2.4m and 3m of Acerinox's shares are currently being placed, representing the bulk of Banesto's 34.5 per cent stake in the company. Pricing will take place after the close today, following roadshows on the stock in London on Tuesday, and in Edinburgh yesterday. James Capel liked Acerinox in August, saying that despite industry conditions, output was rising, the company was generating profits, and that it also had a sound balance sheet. AMSTERDAM drifted lower with early morning activity failing to follow through into late trading. The CBS Tendency index lost 0.3 to 124.0. A slightly weaker dollar also pressured stocks, with Unilever and Akzo both slipping Fl 1.00 to Fl 197.20 and Fl 171.50 respectively. STOCKHOLM weakened in spite of a gain in Ericsson, the telecommunications group, which saw the B shares advance to a new all-time high, up SKr4 at SKr436. The shares were supported by US buying which helped to push turnover up to SKr182m. The Affarsvarlden General index fell 6.2 to 1,289.4 in turnover down to SKr1.1bn from Tuesday's SKr1.4bn. ISTANBUL fell back as investors locked in recent profits, the composite index closing 450.9 lower at 15,326.3.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES September 29  THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          Open    11.30     12.00    13.00 FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1286.08  1287.25   1286.87  1285.46 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1355.39  1355.39   1355.92  1355.68                         14.00    15.00     16.00    Close FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1283.63  1285.83   1287.93  1288.31 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1354.21  1354.77   1356.75  1356.79  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Sep 28    Sep 27    Sep 24    Sep 23    Sep 22 FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1288.96   1290.59   1274.95   1273.84   1271.99 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1364.11   1361.41   1346.86   1347.03   1346.05  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90) High/day: 100 - 1288.53; 200 - 1358.35 Low/day: 100 - 1283.42 200 - 1352.76.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

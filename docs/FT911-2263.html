			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Jaguar to stay in the red with Pounds 70m loss JAGUAR, the UK luxury car maker and a subsidiary of Ford of the US, is expected to report later this month a pre-tax loss of around Pounds 70m for 1990, a further deterioration from a loss of Pounds 49.3m in 1989. Mr Bill Hayden, Jaguar chairman, said financial pressures were forcing a delay of up to 12 months in development programmes of crucial new models for the second half of the decade. Jaguar, taken over by Ford in late 1989 for Pounds 1.4bn, was hit hard last year by the recession in the UK luxury and executive car market and by the weakness of the US dollar. The US is its largest single market. World sales fell 9.8 per cent last year to 42,754 with a 25.1 per cent UK fall. Production was cut by 13 per cent to 41,883. The pressure on the luxury car market has intensified this year. In the first quarter, Jaguar's world sales plunged 45.4 per cent to only 6,774, while output fell 57.8 per cent to 5,339 from 12,652 a year ago. In North America, first-quarter sales were 2,278, a 54.7 per cent drop from a year earlier. First-quarter sales in the UK fell 43.2 per cent to 2,104 and in the rest of Europe by 34.5 per cent to 1,582. The only bright spot was Japan, where sales were unchanged at 590. The company has taken drastic action to lower output and cut costs. It stopped production for six weeks in the first quarter in order to cut bloated stock levels. Jaguar forecasts 1991 output of about 34,500 cars and sales of 36-37,000, the lowest levels since 1984 when it was privatised. It is completing a programme to cut its workforce by around 1,050 through early retirement and voluntary redundancies. Up to 500 more jobs could be cut by the end of the year.</p>

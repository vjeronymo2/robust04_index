			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Letter: Post Office can only deliver publicly Sir, If the UK Post Office is to remain the most efficient in Europe and justify the limited monopoly that enables it to provide a universal and affordable service, then it can only do so in the public sector. The new Post Office chairman, Mike Heron, presents ('Public spirit, private vision', January 26) 1980s options for a business moving to the year 2000. To present a choice between public sector stagnation and private sector innovation is simplistic and deflects from the true issues. We have argued that the Post Office should be free of unfair restrictions and allowed to expand quality and range of services. However, we also recognise that in order to meet a variety of obligations, including many loss-making deliveries, it must remain a unitary business in the public sector. What private company would deliver a letter to the Isle of Skye for 18p? Post Office privatisation will prove a disaster of British Rail proportions, equally difficult to achieve and politically unpopular. The customer, particularly in rural areas, stands to lose a vital resource. Mike Heron inherits the best postal service in the world. A predecessor, Sir Ron Dearing, did a great deal to help the workers in the industry achieve this success. His position was clear. In a letter to staff in 1987 he stated that 'it is as a single unified corporation that the Post Office can best provide the vital communications and financial service that this country needs - efficiently and universally'.

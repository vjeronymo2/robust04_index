			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLAN TO BAN PET BREEDING DRAWS HOWLS  </P> <P> Facing a plague of too many pets, officials in San Mateo County heard arguments  Tuesday on a plan to ban breeding of all cats and dogs.  </P> <P> During a raucous hearing lasting several hours, more than 300 people jeered and  cheered remarks for and against the plan to impose zero pet population growth  in the county, where 10,000 animals are put to death each year.  </P> <P> "The message we're sending is, 'The killing must stop,' " said Kim Sturla,  director of the Peninsula Humane Society, who testified for the plan during the  hearing before the County Board of Supervisors.  </P> <P> Alan Stern of the American Kennel Club advocated more public education for  irresponsible pet owners instead of a moratorium on animal births. Most pet  breeders in the audience took a similar stance.  </P> <P> "All animal lovers abhor the needless destruction of animals," Stern said. "But  this ordinance is a simplistic proposal that will alienate a group you need --  breeders."  </P> <P> Supervisor Tom Nolan, who introduced the ordinance, said he expected it to be  amended before any vote is taken in order to allow breeding of guide dogs for  the blind and possibly to exempt professional breeders.  </P> <P> "I think we've got to do a little compromising before it will pass," said  Nolan.  </P> <P> Any proposed ordinance must be passed in two separate readings before it can go  into effect.  </P> <P> Nolan's proposed ordinance, thought to be the first of its kind in the nation,  would apply to unincorporated areas in this affluent county of 600,000 south of  San Francisco. As originally written, it calls for a one-year moratorium on  breeding beginning Jan. 1 and then mandatory spaying and neutering of all cats  and dogs older than 9 months.  </P> <P> Violators would face fines from $100 to $500, but penalties would be waived if  the animals were subsequently spayed or neutered.  </P></p>

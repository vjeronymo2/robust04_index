			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] A calculator is the most useful tool this  evening to draw the consequences of yesterday's European  elections. [passage omitted]    Edouard Balladur may have been waiting for the release of  these final results before reacting. This morning, the prime  minister regretted the break-up of the French delegation in  Strasbourg. He was keen to add the 12 percent achieved by  Philippe de Villiers's list to the 25 percent gained by the  Baudis list in assessing the weight of the majority.    On a visit to Lille, Edouard Balladur launched his strategy  for the coming months, during a year which--although he has  denied it-- will focus on the presidential elections. Jerome  Cathala and Yves Barbe report:    [Cathala] Whether we have European elections or not, Edouard  Balladur is intent on pursuing his policies. In Lille this  morning, he explained that the performance of the Baudis list  was not a failure. For him, this result shows, on the contrary,  that the strategy of uniting the majority is more indispensable  than ever. For Edouard Balladur, this is a way of putting the  European elections behind him and of thinking about what comes  next:    [Begin Balladur recording] The goal of the government over  the next six months will be, first and foremost, to continue the  recovery and to accelerate it up if need be, despite the  difficulties of the moment. Second, we will call for the  largest possible union, and I am convinced that this is what the  French are waiting for. They are not going to spend the next  year under the stress of opinion polls and the next presidential  elections. [end recording] [passage omitted]</p>

Now,  scientists from the CAS Beijing Vacuum Physics Laboratory  (BVPL), researching a new atomic surface modification technique,  have succeeded in room-temperature direct manipulation of Si  atoms on a surface with a single-crystal silicon (SCS) atomic  arrangement. Average line width for these lines drawn on the SCS  surface via the STM probe is 2 nm (3-4 Si atoms). An STM image  of some sample lines, shown in the accompanying micrograph,  clearly reveals these lines forming the three characters ``Mao  Zedong,'' as well as the neatly laid-out Si-atom lattice in the  background. These are the world's smallest characters  ``written'' on a Si surface to date: average character size is 2  millionths of a cm [i.e., 20 nm].   <FIG ID=JPRS-CST-006-03A>      STM Micrograph of Characters ``Mao Zedong'' Written on Si-Atom Surface Via STM by CAS BVPL Scientists; 500 Angstroms </FIG>    The BVPL scientists were also able to move, or transplant,  Si  atoms from one straight line to form another, raised straight  line. Finally, these scientists were able to neatly transplant  the atoms on the Si surface along a lattice orientation to form  a new straight line in a technique they called ``sequenced  transplantation.''    These three breakthrough achievements in atomic-scale  surface  modification and machining represent a major advance in a high  technology generally recognized as being of major significance  in the coming century, especially in areas such as high-density  information storage, nanoscale-device and quantum-well-device  development, and new materials synthesis.</p>

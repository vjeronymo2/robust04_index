			<p>BFN     [Text] Phnom Penh, May 12 (AFP) -- Cambodian King Norodom  Sihanouk stressed Thursday that his country's only hope against  the Khmer Rouge was foreign military aid, after the United  States said it was considering providing arms to the Cambodian  government.    Military aid is needed "to save Cambodia from the yoke of  the  Khmer Rouge, from genocide ... (and) maintain Cambodia as a  liberal democracy and member of the free world," King Sihanouk  told reporters at the Royal Palace.    "They need everything: new weapons, planes, helicopters,  tanks and also ... ambulances," the king said.    The appeal followed comments by a U.S. State Department  official in Washington on Wednesday that the United States was  considering "the possible provision of lethal assistance" in  view of recent guerrilla activities.    But the official, U.S. Deputy Assistant of State for East  Asian and Pacific Affairs Peter Tomsen, told a congressional  committee that the United States would have to consult other  members of the international community before taking any action.    The king last week said he favored having foreign countries  -- including the United States, France and Australia -- arm,  equip and train Cambodia's army.    King Sihanouk said the failure of government troops to  maintain their hold on the Khmer Rouge base at Pailin in  northwest Cambodia, which they captured March 19, showed how  badly government forces were in need of training. The Cambodian  government has admitted that corrupt commanders spent more time  dividing the spoils of the resource-rich region than defending  it.    "Their behavior in Pailin was not good at all, so there is a  necessity to re-educate our soldiers, to train them and to equip  them," he said.    He added that the forces needed "lessons on behavior,"  referring to reports from human rights watchdog Amnesty  International, who condemned the beheading of a Khmer Rouge  prisoner of war by government troops last week in Cambodia's  northwest.    King Sihanouk said the West "should not say on the one hand  that we must save Cambodia from the yoke of Pol Pot ... and on  the other hand give nothing to the royal government.</p>

			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / International Company News: Citicorp doubles profits to Dollars 183m CITICORP, the largest banking group in the US, yesterday underscored the battered sector's gradual return to financial health. It reported doubled first-quarter profits and said it expected to regain its normal earnings capacity by the year-end. The bank, which has been seriously hurt by the crisis of the past two years in the US and foreign real estate markets, is in the throes of a reorganisation and capital building programme. It reported net income of Dollars 183m, or 37 cents a share, compared to Dollars 93m, or 17 cents, in the same period of 1991. Continuing real estate problems were shown in its Dollars 1,23bn provision for credit losses. This compared with Dollars 1.15bn in the fourth quarter and Dollars 812m in the same period of last year. North American commercial real estate comprised Dollars 588m of the total, compared with Dollars 562m in the previous quarter and Dollars 175m a year ago. Net write-offs totalled Dollars 997m, compared to Dollars 646m a year ago, with North American real estate making up Dollars 362m, compared to Dollars 86m a year ago. Mr John Reed, chairman, told the company's annual meeting yesterday that the US real estate market and Citicorp's portfolio had stabilised. However, he repeated that write-offs and other costs of commercial credit would continue to be about as high in 1992 as in 1991. He said the quarter's results reflected 'continuing progress towards the successful completion of Citicorp's two-year programme to restore profitability, build the company's capital position, and further develop core business franchises.' Net interest revenue rose 4 per cent to Dollars 1.83bn, while the net interest margin rose to 3.76 per cent from 3.66 a year ago. The operating margin - the difference between revenues and operating expenses - rose 23 per cent to Dollars 1.7bn, helped by a 5 per cent growth in revenue and a 6 per cent decline in expenses. The bank's global consumer business produced a 61 per cent improvement in net income to Dollars 260m, helped by solid credit card revenue growth in the US, and a good performance in Germany. Operating expenses fell 5 per cent. The global finance business, which includes most of its commercial business, reported net income down from Dollars 212m to Dollars 161m. Asia, Latin American and the Middle East produced strong growth, but economic weakness in the US Japan and Europe meant a Dollars 17m loss in these regions. The bank's North American commercial real estate operations, which have been reorganised as a separate reporting category, lost Dollars 463m, against Dollars 124m a year ago. The bank's tier one capital ratio, which it wants to boost to at least 5 per cent by the end of 1993, improved 33 basis points in the quarter to 4.06 per cent. Mr Reed told the meeting: 'By the end of the year we expect to have restored our normal earnings capacity and to have significantly improved our balance sheet.'</p>

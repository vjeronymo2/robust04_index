"In dealing with the North Korean nuclear problem, the  intentions and direction of the government have not been fully  delivered to the people, so it is necessary that the information  minister attend some important meetings of cabinet ministers,"  Yi said as security-related ministers met at the prime  minister's office.    "Under the past authoritarian governments, the Agency for  National Security Planning led the way in explaining measures on  North Korea and security, but now this is not proper under a  civilian government," O said. He added that he will attend  security-related meetings in the future and then provide  detailed explanations on government measures and intentions on  security matters.</p>

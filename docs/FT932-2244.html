			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / International Company News: Kugelfischer unit in liquidation EASTERN Germany's fragile industrial base suffered a telling blow yesterday when Kugelfischer, the bearings group, put its crippled Leipzig-based subsidiary into liquidation. Deutsche Kugellagerfabriken Leipzig, which employs more than 2,000 people in four factories, had failed to obtain further public or private backing, and was unable to meet its obligations, the management said. The Treuhand privatisation agency which sold the east German company to Kugelfischer three years ago, said it was the worst corporate collapse in its experience, although other privatised companies were in difficulties. Kugelfischer had offered to give DKFL back to the agency, but there was no contractual or legal basis for its return, the Treuhand said. Kugelfischer, which supplies bearings to most of German industry, lost DM439m (Dollars 265m) last year, while the deficit within the German parent concern soared to DM630m after a DM4m net profit in 1991. A restructuring plan launched at the start of this year originally proposed the elimination of 6,500 of the group's 23,000 jobs and the sale of non-core businesses employing a further 6,500. Following the appointment of Mr Kajo Neukirchen, a company consultant, Kugelfischer took an even tougher line on costs and overheads, planning to close or sell more than half its complement of 17 factories, affecting 7,550 employees. Kugelfischer said last month that there was no solution in sight for DKFL, formerly one of the biggest bearings makers in the eastern bloc. In 1991, the last year for which full figures are available, it lost DM142m on sales of DM113m. In 1992, losses were about DM300m. Kugelfischer was one of the first of Germany's industrial companies to feel the effects of international recession.</p>

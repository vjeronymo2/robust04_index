			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HEF II  </P> <P> As a woman the same age as Christie, I offer a female perspective on why  Playboy's image has dwindled over the years with suggestions on how they can  improve it.  </P> <P> Playboy, especially the Playboy Channel, has focused on the male fantasies of  who women are and what they desire. Women are shown totally nude while the men  are clothed; women are portrayed as insatiably sex-starved and mindless, and  the story lines and dialogue are ridiculous. If Playboy truly wants success, it  needs to consider its female viewers and its couples, and to understand that  today, while we welcome fantasy, we also need some reality, honesty and  responsibility in sexual and personal relationships. The old days are over.  Playboy needs to grow up, too.  </P> <P> NORA AMRANI, Studio City  </P></p>

			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / International Company News: Thomson hit by drop in newspaper advertising FIERCE competition in the UK travel market and continued weakness in North American newspaper advertising helped lower Thomson Corp's second-quarter earnings by 11 per cent. The Canadian-controlled group, the UK's largest tour operator, reiterated it was 'not prepared to concede market share' to its competitors in the travel market. Despite heavy discounting of brochure prices, Thomson said it had not cut back its summer holiday capacity. Although Thomson Travel's sales climbed by 11 per cent in the second quarter, operating profits dipped to USDollars 30m from Dollars 32m a year earlier. The group as a whole reported a drop in second-quarter earnings to Dollars 70m, or 12 cents a share, from Dollars 79m, or 13 cents a year earlier. Sales rose to Dollars 1.53bn from Dollars 1.4bn. The fall was most pronounced at Thomson's North American newspapers, where operating profits fell to Dollars 54m from Dollars 64m on virtually unchanged sales. The company said prospects have receded of 'an imminent economic recovery of sufficient strength to generate significantly higher revenue growth'. The UK regional newspaper business also remains weak, with the recession more than offsetting gains in circulation and expanded advertising market share. Thomson Tour Operations' 1991/92 winter sales were 24 per cent higher than the previous year, and sales of summer 1992 holidays were 'marginally ahead'. But said over-capacity has resulted in prolonged price discounting. By contrast, Lunn Poly, Thomson's travel shop subsidiary, posted a substantial first-half profits increase.</p>

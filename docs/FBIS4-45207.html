			<p>Obtaining   Precursors   <F P=102> PY2705150394 Lima EXPRESO in Spanish 13 May 94 p A10 </F> <F P=103> PY2705150394 </F> <F P=104>  Lima EXPRESO </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN     [Text] According to agents of the National Antidrug  Division (Dinandro), the drug trafficking organizations that  operate in the Upper Huallaga and in the outskirts of the jungle  in Ayacucho are reportedly operating behind businesses, mostly  battery factories, which they use to get tonnes of precursors to  make cocaine base and cocaine hydrochloride.    Experts and chemists of Dinandro's Division of Research and  Control of Chemicals said that the sulfuric acid reportedly used  by about 37 small shops and battery factories in Huancayo does  not reflect the number of products they put on the market.    According to police calculations, these industries buy an  average of 70 tonnes of sulfuric acid, which is essential for  making drugs, every month. With that amount they could make at  least 45,000 batteries. Their production is, however, no more  than 444 batteries.    Dinandro came to the conclusion that 80 percent of the  sulfuric acid bought by some of these factories is sent to the  narcotics labs located in Palmapampa (Ayacucho) and in the Upper  Huallaga.    They explained that the drug cartels have studied the  geographic location of Huancayo, which has a permanent  transportation flow between the capital, the central mountain  range, and the jungle, and have made this their nerve center for  the supply of precursors for their labs making cocaine base and  cocaine.  <H5>  Fooling the Authorities </H5>   One of the ways of evading police control is to declare  their  companies bankrupt after having made large purchases of  precursors for three or four months or, in some cases, almost  six months.    Thus, after having bought at least some 100 or 120 tonnes of  sulfuric acid, and having profited during this period of time by  no less than $100,000 in business with the Upper Huallaga and  Palmapampa "companies," they declare that they have gone  bankrupt, and destroy their accounting and purchase books, thus  preventing the use made of the precursors from being  investigated.    There have been cases, however, in which from the same line  of business--battery manufacturing plants--they obtain more  permits in the names of their wives, children, and relatives,  who agree to join the game.    They also go to the police precincts to report losses of  sulfuric acid in transport, and that 60 to 70 percent of the  tonnes being transported had been lost as a result of leaks in  the containers.    Recently they have been stating that less concentrated  sulfuric acid (with a 1.25 density) is sold as "battery liquid"  in settlements in which batteries are used because they have no  electricity.  <H5>  Demanding Exemption </H5>   Recently, the Huancayo battery manufacturers have asked the  Industry, Tourism and Integration Ministry to declare the  Verification Act void.    Dinandro experts and chemists assert that this request will  benefit the drug trafficking cartels and their suppliers because  they can thus obtain the precursors without any difficulty, and  will be able to increase the amount of cocaine and cocaine base  production.    According to Dinandro sources this would be enormously easy,  as the regional office of the Industry, Tourism and Integration  Ministry has no trained employees to evaluate the precursors and  control them.</p>

			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Pressure on glass producer GLASS maker Pilkington was one of the chief casualties in a generally unhappy building materials arena as the market picked up hints that a flurry of profits downgradings could be in the pipeline. The company is believed to have requested meetings with a number of stockbroking analysts over the next few days and dealers speculated that these might reveal plans for cost-cutting and write-downs. Specialists said a large seller of Pilkington shares emerged late on Monday afternoon and triggered initial downward pressure on the stock. Additionally, NatWest Securities highlighted the impact on the building materials stocks of economic slowdown in continental Europe. There has also been speculation that Pilkington may seek to raise capital, although some dealers said a rights issue around the current share price appears unlikely. Pilkington's preliminary results are due in June and analysts' forecasts range from Pounds 30m to Pounds 40m. The shares weakened to 105 1/2 p at one point yesterday before stabilising to end 2 1/2 off at 110 1/2 p. Turnover of 6.8m shares was well above average.</p>

			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Progress seen on EC political union SIGNIFICANT progress on the road to European political union was claimed yesterday by Luxembourg, current holder of the community presidency, in advance of publication today of a draft treaty likely to set the final shape of the union. Mr Jacques Poos, Luxembourg foreign minister, speaking after a meeting with EC counterparts, said that two important proposals had the backing of most member countries. These cover a common foreign and security policy and an increase in law-making power for the European parliament. The probable final shape of political union in the community is due to emerge today when a draft treaty is to be presented by the Luxembourg presidency. The treaty would create the common EC foreign and security policy (CFSP), set parliamentary powers for Strasbourg, give EC citizens the vote elsewhere in the community, and cut the commission to one representative for each of the 12 member states' governments. The document would also endorse, for the first time, inter-governmental co-operation among the Twelve on police and immigration issues. Tabling of the wide-ranging 95-page document comes after three months of negotiation on political union, on which Luxembourg hopes to get agreement by the end of June. Revision of the EC treaty requires unanimous assent of the 12 member governments, along with ratification by the 12 national parliaments. Mr Poos, however, when describing the 'large majority' in favour of two of the main proposals, said there were 'no irreducible differences' dividing that majority from the dissenters such as Britain. Under the Luxembourg compromise draft, the EC's new architecture would have an overarching preamble referring to the aims of the 'European Union'. The treaties proper would be divided into three, covering: Standard Community activities, including the Treaty of Rome amended to incorporate monetary union, and the EC's separate coal, steel and nuclear treaties; An area of mixed EC/national competence on the CFSP with some Commission involvement and majority voting where at present there is none; Codification of purely inter-governmental co-operation on judicial and police issues, such as drugs, crime, political asylum and immigration visas. To make the executive body more efficient, Luxembourg proposes only one commissioner per country. Of the five larger states which currently have two, only Britain so far backs this proposal. The presidency has also adopted a Spanish proposal to allow EC citizens to reside anywhere across the Community and to vote in local and EC polls. Hitherto EC citizens have had a right to work, rather than to reside, in each other's countries. Yesterday's foreign ministers meeting displayed a majority in favour of bringing eventually defence, as well as foreign and security policy, within the EC. Within this majority, however, France and Italy expressed disappointment that the presidency's draft was not more explicit about incorporating the Western European Union (WEU) into the EC, and only called for a review in 1996. From the British side, Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, UK European affairs minister, said the WEU should only be mentioned alongside Nato, with the stipulation that European defence should only be carried out through these two bodies. The UK minister said the Luxembourg plan for majority voting on detailed foreign policy decisions could lead to dissension, rather than coherence. Also in opposition were Denmark, a non-WEU member which wants defence left to Nato, Portugal, which wants majority voting on the basis of one vote per country, and neutral Ireland which none the less seems relieved the plan would not frontally challenge its neutrality until 1996. The other significant area of broad agreement at the Luxembourg gathering was the proposal to give the Strasbourg parliament an equal say with the council of ministers on a select new category of fundamental laws. Only the UK and Denmark opposed this outright. Others, such as France, Spain, Belgium and the Netherlands took another tack to complain that co-decision, involving setting up conciliation machinery between the parliament and the council similar to that between the two houses of the US Congress, might delay decision-making and squeeze the commission out.

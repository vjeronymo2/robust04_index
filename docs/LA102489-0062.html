			<p><P> October 24, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TITANS' COCHELL, TENNESSEE DISCUSS COACHING JOB  </P> <P> Cal State Fullerton baseball Coach Larry Cochell has held discussions with  University of Tennessee Athletic Director Doug Dickey about the school's vacant  baseball coaching job and might travel to Knoxville for further talks, Cochell  confirmed Monday.  </P> <P> Cochell, 49, has been at Fullerton for two seasons, guiding the Titans to the  College World Series in his first season after replacing Augie Garrido, but  finishing with the Titans' worst record since 1973 last year, 30-27.  </P> <P> "I have been contacted by Tennessee," Cochell said. "I'm extremely happy where  I am."  </P> <P> The Tennessee position has been open about two months since the resignation of  Mark Connor, who left a coaching job with the New York Yankees to take the  Tennessee job two years ago and has now returned to the Yankees.  </P> <P> Tennessee set school records for losses in a season in each of the past two,  finishing 23-36 overall last season, 4-23 in the Southeastern Conference.  </P> <P> Dickey has told the Knoxville News-Sentinel that the list of candidates has  been narrowed to five. Other candidates mentioned prominently by the  News-Sentinel include interim coach Mike Barnett, Florida State assistant Rob  Delmonico, Western Carolina Coach Jack Leggett, Cleveland (Tenn.) State Coach  Steve Longley and Miami assistant Turtle Thomas.  </P> <P> Cochell said he first talked with Dickey about two weeks ago, and that he had  sought and received Fullerton Athletic Director Ed Carroll's permission to hold  discussions.  </P> <P> Carroll declined to comment.  </P> <P> Cochell coached at Northwestern for one season and at Oral Roberts for 10  before taking the job at Fullerton when Garrido resigned to become coach at  Illinois. Cochell also has been a head coach at Emporia (Kan.) State, Creighton  and Cal State Los Angeles.  </P></p>

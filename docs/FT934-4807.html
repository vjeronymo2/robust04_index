			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / After The Budget: TUC warns of big public-sector job losses As many as 270,000 public-sector jobs will be lost during the next two years as a result of the chancellor's public spending plans, the Trades Union Congress said yesterday. It said local government services would be the hardest hit. The TUC also estimated that the take-home pay of the average worker, assuming a 4 per cent pay rise, would be cut by 2 per cent in real terms because of the effect of inflation and tax increases. The TUC said the cut for 'scapegoated' public-sector workers would be even bigger. 'Mr Clarke's assault on the public sector is worse than anything we saw in the Thatcher decade,' said Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary. 'His assumption that the public services can carry on for the next three years with reduced funding and fewer staff is totally unrealistic.' By extending for a further two years the freeze on public-sector pay already planned for 1994-95, the government is forcing public-sector workers to choose between big job cuts and big pay cuts, the TUC said. It said it was the government's 'undeclared intention' to save Pounds 3bn-Pounds 4bn a year on the public-sector pay bill. 'The anticipated savings from the reductions are intended to bridge the gap between the Pounds 5.1bn projected underspend in government expenditure totals,' it added. Pay analysts, such as Mr Chris Trinder of the Public Finance Foundation, say the wage gap between the public and private sectors is likely to widen. But the government appears to believe that at a time of high unemployment this will not necessarily cause people to shift to the private sector. The five pay review bodies - which cover about 2m of the 5m public-sector workers - will warn the government that the pay policy will hit morale in the sector. But the position of the review bodies themselves looks increasingly provisional. The review bodies, covering such sectors as the army, doctors and dentists, nurses and teachers, have already seen their pay-setting authority undermined by the 1.5 per cent limit for 1993-94. Despite this, the teachers' review body still met and produced a report on restructuring. Since the announcement in September of the pay-bill freeze for 1994-95, the five bodies have continued to hear evidence from unions and employers and are expected to produce reports in January. 'They will come to their own independent judgments,' said Mr Mike Cahill, of the review bodies' secretariat. So far there have been no resignations over government pay policy from the 40 people who sit on the review bodies, but the latest move could provoke some reaction.</p>

			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Fears increase for further Bosnian flashpoint Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader, yesterday vowed that he would block any moves to designate as a United Nations 'safe area' the town of Brcko, on the eastern end of the Serb corridor in Bosnia. The 'corridor is of vital interest to the Serbian nation', he said, ruling out any possible change in the status of Brcko, which has 'always been in Serb hands'. Earlier, Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, had called on the UN to make the Brcko corridor 'a security zone' with the same status as Sarajevo or Gorazde, so that Nato aircraft could intervene 'at the first cannon shot . . . by one side or the other'. Speaking to the Anglo-American Press Association in Paris, Mr Juppe described the Brcko corridor as 'very sensitive' to both Moslems, who wanted it for access to the Sava river and thence to the Danube, and to Serbs, who wanted it to link their territories in east and west Bosnia. UN officials fear the town will be the next flashpoint and are considering how a conflict can be avoided. In Gorazde, the Moslem enclave in south-east Bosnia, UN reports cite heightened tensions, including an incident on Saturday in which British soldiers returned fire, killing two Serbs. In a similar incident near Tuzla, another UN 'safe area', nine Serbs were killed after firing four anti-tank missiles at soldiers from the Nordic battalion who used their tanks in the exchange. There were further reports yesterday that Serb forces are concentrating their heavy weapons in the strategic north-eastern region. Mr Haris Silajdzic, Bosnian prime minister, who today is due to meet Mr Yasushi Akashi, senior UN official for former Yugoslavia, in Sarajevo to discuss resuming peace talks, yesterday warned that his government would not rejoin negotiations until Serb forces complied fully with a Nato ultimatum to withdraw from a 20 km zone around Gorazde. UN officials said at the weekend that Serb soldiers had shed their army fatigues only to return in blue uniforms in the guise of policemen protecting Serb settlers. The immediate resettlement of Serbs is part of a Serb plan to partition Gorazde. In Sarajevo, Nato aircraft buzzed a weapons depot ending a four-hour standoff between Serb forces trying to take back their heavy weapons from UN soldiers.</p>

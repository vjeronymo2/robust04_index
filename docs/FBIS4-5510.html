The joint meeting discussed practical measures to implement  the "10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation  for the reunification of the country" personally worked out by  the great leader President Kim Il-song, on the occasion of the  first anniversary of its publication.    In his report at the meeting Yang Hyong-sop, alternate  Politburo member of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party  of Korea and chairman of the Supreme People's Assembly, proposed  to hold a national conference whereby the seventy million  Koreans in the North and the South and abroad can find the way  of achieving the great unity of the whole nation transcending  ideology and system as the same fellow countrymen.    In this regard he said:    "The national conference may be held in the form of a  roundtable conference in which the authorities and  representatives of political parties and public organizations  and individual personages in the North and the South and  representatives of Koreans overseas participate on an equal  footing.    "The meeting may open-heartedly discuss concerns of the  whole  nation, including practical measures to attain the great unity  of the whole nation and common tasks of the nation raised as  indispensable requisites to achieving the national reunification  at an early date in the '90s.    "We consider it necessary to form a preparatory committee  for  the national conference consisting of five delegates each from  the North and the South and abroad in order to successfully hold  the national conference.    "We think it advisable to have the first session either in  Pyongyang or in Seoul toward mid-May in order to run the  preparatory committee for the national conference.    "Availing ourselves of this opportunity, we hold that the  South Korean authorities should discontinue nuclear war  exercises and abandon the (international cooperation system)  from the stand of national independence for the sake of the  great unity of the whole nation and thus create a favourable  atmosphere for the convocation of the national conference."    The joint meeting adopted a letter addressed to the South  Korean authorities, political parties, public organizations and  individual personages and Koreans overseas containing the  proposal of holding a national conference.</p>

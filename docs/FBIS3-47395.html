Mara, 73, had been acting as head of state since December,  when former president and high chief Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau  travelled to the United States for leukaemia treatment. He died  in Washington on December 16.    "Ratu Sir Kamisese, with all his experience in international  politics, will continue where Ratu Sir Penaia left off," said  Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka, who chaired the chiefs' meeting  as minister for Fijian affairs.    Mara was prime minister when Fiji gained independence from  Britain on October 10, 1970 and held the position until 1987  when his National Alliance Party was defeated by a coalition  which had the support of the country's large ethnic Indian  community.    Within weeks, the coalition, led by Timoci Bavadra, was  toppled by troops led by then Brigadier Rabuka, who declared  Fiji a republic in October 1987.    Mara was appointed head of an interim government and held  the  post until 1992, when parliamentary rule was restored in a  general election.    The new president's only competition was his brother-in-law  and high-chief Ratu Mosese Tuisowau, whose nomination did not  surface at the meeting although his name had been forwarded by  the rival Great Council of Viti Levu Chiefs.    The rival council is made up of chiefs on the main island of  Viti Levu.    On July 25 1990, a new constitution was promulgated in Fiji  giving indigenous Fijians the right to hold the prime  ministership and a guaranteed majority of 37 seats in the  70-member parliament.    Twenty-seven seats are reserved for Fijians of Indian  descent, who first arrived from India as indentured labourers  for the former British colonial powers in the late 19th century,  and who are about as numerous as native Fijians.    The other six seats are held by Europeans and other small  minorities.</p>

			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAGAZINES: SPINNING A GLOBAL YARN;  </P> <P> NEW-AGE CONSULTANTS PUT HIGH-TECH, PSYCHOLOGICALLY SLICK TWISTS ON PUBLIC  RELATIONS.  </P> <P> Think the spin doctors are having fun with California's gubernatorial primary?  Wait until you see what they're doing to the rest of the world -- make that the  Brave New World.  </P> <P> As one spin doc puts it, "Something is happening in the world, and it ain't  politics in any form known before, and it's gonna change everything."  </P> <P> What's happening -- high falutin' terminology aside -- is good old public  relations. But it's public relations with a high-tech, psychologically  sophisticated twist.  </P> <P> In a darn-near brilliant piece of reportage in the April Manhattan Inc.,  staffer Maura Sheehy examines the Sawyer Miller Group, a New York-based  consulting firm, which, in its own arrogant view, is revolutionizing the  emerging democracies of the world and helping to "restructure" America.  </P> <P> Speaking a stilted, largely inarticulate New Age-esque newspeak, the PR guys at  Sawyer Miller talk of "electronic democracies" and "global linkages."  </P> <P> But when Corazon Aquino's people call in the middle of the Philippine night to  ask how to treat the major earthquake that just hit, they offer very specific  spins. When they talk to the leaders or aspiring leaders of Poland or Colombia,  they explain to them how to use television to make their people think "the  government can become a part of the family," Sheehy writes.  </P> <P> Through careful research into the country it is advising, the firm, Sheehy  writes, "can discover what expectations are, so a government can be careful to  meet those expectations, or more cynically, to appear to meet them."  </P> <P> Or sidetrack them. Before the new Solidarity government in Poland forces its  austerity program on the Polish people, for instance, it may just take the  firm's advice and put "some sexy French TV" on the national television station,  as an "opiate and distraction," Sheehy reports.  </P> <P> Sawyer Miller's "manifesto" is purportedly to promote "fluid democracy and  fluid dialogue." As the article's author points out, though, "What sometimes  seems absent . . . is the quality and content of the dialogue."  </P> <P> Too often, the PR-generated dialogues, such as those that dominated the last  U.S. presidential campaign, "hit voters deeply, viscerally, emotionally. They  weren't geared to rational, informed debate."  </P> <P> Still, these spin docs have technical skills that give them power "independent  of any constituency, save that of the CEOs and politicians who pay their fees."  </P> <P> And with that power they are shaping the way people in South and Central  America, Eastern Europe, the Philippines and United States, among other places,  will live.  </P> <P> Fluid democracy aside, what they really hope to create, Sheehy charges, "is a  kind of shadow government just behind the ears of power, just out of the camera  shot."  </P> <P> </P> <P> MUST READ  </P> <P> * In Peru, where cocaine is the economy, where Maoist guerrillas calling  themselves "the shining path" hack to death 39 Indians at a shot, where the  inflation rate was 3,000% last year, it makes a magical realist sort of sense  for a novelist to run for president. In the April Esquire, Guy Martin follows  Mario Vargas Llosa on the campaign trail as this former  Marxist-turned-Thatcherite, decked out in his $1,500 suits, glad-hands his way  through villages of his "rock-sucking poor" countrymen. By the way: Guess which  PR firm is handling his campaign?  </P> <P> * Are Robert Redford, Francis Ford Coppola, George Lucas and other Hollywood  movers dupes of Fidel Castro? That's the assertion of an incendiary article in  the April 16 New Republic. In question is Cuba's internationally known film  foundation, headed by novelist Gabriel Garcia Marquez. As portrayed in the  piece, Marquez is something of politically motivated money grubber, and he and  Fidel "are using a cultural project to legitimize one of the last bastions of  Stalinist rule -- then roping in Hollywood to do the PR."  </P> <P> * When a Japanese company bought an American Mexican food chain recently, the  jokes about sushi burritos reflected the nation's growing anxiety about foreign  takeovers. In the March Business Tokyo, "The people who work at three  illustrious concerns describe what it is like to be Bought By the Japanese."  Actually, it's the people who run those companies who do most of the  describing. As a consequence, the piece is pretty upbeat. It's also  informative.  </P> <P> * "We particularly want to thank the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and  Sciences for its generous assistance. . . ." Who's talking here? Jessica Tandy?  Akira Kurosawa? Nope. It's Architectural Digest in its introduction to its  April "Academy Awards Collector's Edition!" More interesting than any of the  after-awards party coverage, the issue offers glimpses into the homes of film  stars past and present, including Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Mary  Pickford, Katharine Hepburn, Bette Davis, Lillian Gish, Liza Minnelli, Gene  Hackman, Humphrey Bogart and Marlon Brando.  </P> <P> * To most people, it will look like a strange stamp collection. Trivia junkies  and nostalgia freaks, however, will probably spend hours poring over Sports  Illustrated's special 35th anniversary issue with 35 years of SI covers.  </P> <P> * Horror stories about communist and Nazi kids who snitched on their parents to  the KGB or Gestapo once were the basic stuff of American propaganda. Now, here  in America, we salute the youngsters who fink on mom or dad for drug use. The  April Life magazine presents an complex and intriguing profile of Bradley  O'Hara, a 9-year-old who turned in his mom.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SHREDDER FODDER  </P> <P> * As usual, this week's Entertainment Weekly is in too big a hurry to spend  more than a few paragraphs on any film, TV show, book or musical creation. But  it does devote six full pages of homage to the making of one of those "hip,  glamorous," Nike ads by Spike Lee. Yawn.  </P> <P> </P> <P> NEW ON NEWS RACKS  </P> <P> * Countryside, a new magazine "devoted to the interests of the increasing  number of weekend or full-time countrysiders -- contemporary young  professionals and their families who yearn for a simpler, unspoiled life style  closer to nature" is just about as good and bad as you'd expect.  </P> <P> At its best, it offers pieces such as author Alston Chase's thoughtful essay on  the reality awaiting urban exiles: "Ecological decline is not something we can  run away from."  </P> <P> At its worst, the Hearst Corp. bimonthly carries newspaper reprints such as:  "The Greening of a Wall Streeter -- An ex-banker milks her sheep for gourmet  cheese and yogurt."  </P> <P> In either case, the magazine deserves applause for contributing the charter  advertising revenues from the slick first issue to organizations that buy  ecologically sensitive land to protect it.  </P></p>

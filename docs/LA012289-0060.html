			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NON-JAPANESE CUSTOM  </P> <P> In regards to the article "The Turning Point" (by Itabari Njeri, Jan. 1) about  the Japanese-Americans' concern over their culture's future. As a  third-generation Japanese-American, I found this article to be somewhat  overblown.  </P> <P> My father was in a relocation camp and my parents are Buddhists. I'm  non-religious. My wife and I do not observe any Japanese customs in our  household and we will not force our two small children to attend Saturday  morning Japanese-language school as many of our peers were forced to do by  well-meaning parents.  </P> <P> My children will most likely marry Caucasians and our grandchildren will be of  mixed blood. We will not pressure them to marry in the same ethnic class as  many Nisei and Issei parents have done to their children. Our major concern is  that our children grow up happy and successful. If they want to learn about  their heritage and culture, they will do so on their own.  </P> <P> HENRY SAKAIDA  </P> <P> Temple City  </P></p>

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Israelis and Syrians jockey for position / A look at the strategic importance of the commanding Golan Heights YOU don't have to be any sort of military expert to see what excites both Israel and Syria about the Golan Heights, the bone of contention between the two enemies at the Middle East peace talks in Washington. From the top of one of a string of volcanic outcrops that stand like sentinels along the Israeli-held side of the ceasefire line, there is a commanding panorama over the Syrian town of Kunetra across open plains sweeping 60 km north-eastwards to Damascus. An Israeli tank could reach the capital in a couple of hours, a most unsettling thought for Syria's leaders. Equally, the heights form an imposing physical barrier guarding Israel's north-eastern flank. Once down the western escarpment of the Golan, the way is clear to control vital water resources of the Sea of Galilee and Jordan River, and to run quickly across Galilee to the port of Haifa. Israel has occupied the Golan since capturing them from Syria in the 1967 Six Day War. It nearly lost them to a Syrian tank assault in 1973, but recovered and vowed never to relinquish its control. Now, however, Syria's willingness to negotiate with Israel has posed an unprecedented challenge to the hitherto unyielding Israeli determination, in the words of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, 'never to go down from the Golan Heights.' Before the latest round of peace talks now going on in Washington, Mr Rabin himself caused uproar at home by saying it was clear that peace with Syria would require 'some sort of territorial compromise' over the Golan. At the moment, Israel and Syria are only at the stage of negotiating a joint statement of principles that would lead on to dealing with the central issue of the Golan. But Mr Rabin will then have to reveal what compromise he has in mind. So far, he has given no indication that he would concede the long-standing Syrian demand that Israel withdraw from the entire territory. However, unlike the other occupied territories of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, there is no strong ideological argument among Israelis for holding on to the Golan. Even most of the right-wing and religious Israeli nationalists who have settled in the West Bank and Gaza do not regard the heights as part of the biblical Land of Israel, or Eretz Israel, which must never be relinquished on ideological grounds. In fact, most of the 12,000 Jewish settlers in the Golan voted for Mr Rabin's Labour party or its left-liberal allies in the June election. Most are concerned that Israel should not give up the Golan and are organising a 'peace with the Golan' campaign. Mr Rabin has publicly floated the idea of acknowledging Syrian sovereignty over the Golan on a lease-back basis allowing Israelis to stay, but the Syrians have dismissed it. The key issue remains that of military security. 'Among serious Israeli military analysts there remains a consensus that the Golan comprises vital strategic depth for Israel,' says Mr Joseph Alpher, deputy head of Tel Aviv University's Jaffee Centre for Strategic Studies. 'Even in the missile age, it is crucial to the defence of northern Israel.' But Mr Alpher suggests this does not imply that Israel must maintain a physical presence on the heights in the form of troops and tanks. He says the emphasis should be on enlarging the strategic depth of the Golan area by the establishment of a big demilitarised zone covering the heights and surrounding territory. 'In terms of what the real security needs are, this is the real issue,' says Mr Alpher. Syrian officials yesterday said two-and-a-half hours of talks with Israel on the Golan Heights issue had failed to make progress and that negotiations were near deadlock, write our Middle East staff. Mr Mouwafak al-Allaf, chief Syrian delegate to the talks, said there was 'no progress whatsoever' in yesterday's talks, adding that he feared the Israeli delegation 'did not come here with any authority to talk about peace and talk about all the important elements and issues.'</p>

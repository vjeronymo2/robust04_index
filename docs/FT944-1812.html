			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Books: A born raconteur writes home I'M HERE I THINK, WHERE ARE YOU? by Timothy West Nick Hern Pounds 14.99, 224 pages Touring days, alluring days, someone trills in one of Coward's more sentimental numbers; no longer. Few actors in modern times have felt its allure quite as strongly as Timothy West and his wife Prunella Scales. I'm Here I Think, Where are You? is a collection of the letters which West has sent to Scales over 30 years of touring, national and global; their publication makes more widely available the shrewdness, drollery, and brilliant raconteurial gifts of a delightful companion. His theme is inevitably geographical and theatrical, but the book's appeal is not to be confined to theatre - or indeed movie-goers. Typically direct and undeluded, he conveys an affection for and a fascination with the craft of which he is such a master; sometimes one could wish to know more (I could wish to know more) about how he went about creating his satyr-like Shpigelsky in A Month in The Country (a performance in a supporting role which brought an entire universe of character onto the stage) or his heart-broken and heart-breaking Enobarbus. In the end, though, he is not interested in analysing his work: well he was writing home to his wife, after all, and trying to tell her about where he was and what was happening (there is a letter of great power about a visit to Russia) and to raise a laugh, which he succeeds in doing again and again. Reading the book is as easy, as diverting (and as frequently instructive) as sitting down to supper with the man; pour yourself a nice malt whisky and settle down with it. You had better bring the bottle over, come to think of it, because once you have started you will find it hard to stop.</p>

			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Observer: Home to roost Meanwhile Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd faces an unlooked-for challenge for his MP's seat at Witney in Oxfordshire. One of his constituency's council members, Marilyn Brown, is standing against him on a 'Fair Trials Abroad' ticket, accusing the foreign office of refusing 'to lift a finger' on behalf of British victims of injustice abroad. She admits a private interest in the topic. Her 28-year-old son Nicholas has spent 15 months in prison in Goa, awaiting trial for possessing half an ounce of cannabis - a charge his mother says is false but, even if true, would scarcely warrant the 10 years' minimum sentence it carries. She also insists that, in any event, her son's predicament is minor compared with many worse examples over which the Foreign Office refuses to stir. To which Hurd's response is that his department can involve itself only in cases of 'manifest injustice'. Even so, Foreign Office sources suggest that the electoral challenge may be having an effect. A circular has gone round 'reminding' all embassies and consulates to give the most careful attention to such cases.</p>

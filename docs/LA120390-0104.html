			<p><P> December 3, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEALS: MARKET WATCH;  </P> <P> 'WAITING FOR THE DOUGH,' A DRAMA STARRING R. H. MACY  </P> <P> For weeks now, R. H. Macy &amp; Co., the financially distressed retailer, has  told people that it is raising $250 million of new money from its stockholders.  But Macy's has yet to receive a penny of the promised funds, and it isn't clear  when the money will appear. If you made a drama out of this, you would have to  call it "Waiting for the Dough."  </P> <P> Hopefully, Macy's money will show up before Godot -- who, as you may recall,  was due at any moment but never put in an appearance.  </P> <P> Macy's, to its credit -- no pun intended -- has managed to get amazing mileage  just by telling the world that its shareholders, who include some of America's  richest and smartest investors, were riding to the rescue. The announcements  that General Electric Capital Corp. will buy Macy's credit subsidiary for $100  million, and that GECC and other Macy's stockholders will fork over $100  million to $150 million to buy new Macy's shares, reassured Macy's suppliers  and kept merchandise flowing in.  </P> <P> So Macy's has made it to the peak of the Christmas selling season, now under  way, with a maximum of merchandise on its shelves and a minimum of bad  publicity. Which is a lot better than Federated Department Stores, now in  bankruptcy, did under similar circumstances a year ago. If Macy's had managed  its business as deftly as it has managed the news, it wouldn't be in any  trouble.  </P> <P> But the talk is starting to wear a bit thin. Godot, where are you?  </P> <P> The key to whether Macy's management and its stockholders are serious about  helping the company or whether they're just trying to bluff their way past  Christmas, is the stock purchase deal. The sale of Macy's Credit is nice --  every $100 million helps, even when you're $5.6 billion in debt. But under  Macy's loan agreements, the cash that the company gets from that sale, which is  supposed to close in January, must be used to repay relatively low-cost bank  debt.  </P> <P> The stock sale is where the real drama lies. A sale, I must mention, that  values Macy's equity at the same $300 million that investors paid in Macy's  1986 leveraged buyout. A price that is a mere one-fifth of the price that  Macy's was asking for its stock in September, swearing up and down that it  wouldn't sell for less. That quick 80% markdown gives you an idea of how badly  Macy's needs the money, which it could use to buy back perhaps $400 million of  its bonds.  </P> <P> Even if $150 million of new cash arrives soon, Macy's will still be left with  its basic problem: It is so heavily laden with debt from the LBO and the 1988  purchase of two Federated chains that it's hard to see how it can dig its way  out. The company's operations make money, but not enough to cover its interest  payments.  </P> <P> This isn't just me trying to depress you. This is essentially what the Standard  &amp; Poor's bond-rating people said recently when S&amp;P announced that it is  thinking of downgrading Macy's already depressed bonds.  </P> <P> If you cast an eye over Macy's balance sheet and income statement, then look at  the recession/depression that's starting to afflict its major markets, you have  to conclude that Macy's has a good chance of going Chapter 11 in 1991. (The  company, you should know, says I'm full of beans.)  </P> <P> A Macy's bankruptcy is not something I'm eager to see, if only because Macy's  is the biggest advertiser in Newsday, the newspaper that pays my salary. But a  Macy's bankruptcy wouldn't be the end of the world. Even with Macy's in Chapter  11, its namesake chain and its Bullock's and I. Magnin department store chains  would operate, as would its Aeropostale, Charter Club and Fantasies by Morgan  Taylor specialty chains. After all, Federated is in Chapter 11, but  Bloomingdale's is still around.  </P> <P> But a bankruptcy would pretty much wipe out the value of Macy's stock. Given  that fact -- and the fact that you can make up to 80% a year on your money by  buying Macy's bonds if the company doesn't default -- why would anyone in his  right mind buy Macy's stock, which is riskier than the bonds?  </P> <P> Given the identities of the four investors who have committed to buy $100  million of the stock if other holders don't come across -- GE Capital ($43.1  million), Laurence Tisch's Loews tobacco-television-insurance conglomerate  ($25.8 million), Michael Price's Mutual Shares mutual funds ($22.4 million) and  Michigan shopping mall mogul A. Alfred Taubman ($8.7 million) -- we are  obviously dealing with people in their right minds.  </P> <P> The obvious thing for these investors to do, if their motivations are merely  financial, is keep their checkbooks in their pockets until after Christmas. If  Macy's has a decent Christmas, they buy the new stock and pray. If Macy's has  an awful Christmas, they put the company into Chapter 11 and try to use their  $150 million to buy control of the post-bankruptcy Macy's, which will have much  less debt than the current Macy's.  </P> <P> Macy's won't say anything but wants it known that it expects the stockholders  to buy their shares before Christmas. A spokesperson for GE Capital, the only  stockholder that would talk on the record, first said the deal is supposed to  be completed next year, then the next day retreated to vague generalities.  After Macy's made a call or two to GE, no doubt.  </P> <P> All four investors have an interest in Macy's other than its stock: Loews and  Mutual Shares own bonds whose price would increase if new stock is sold, GECC  is a big lender to Macy's and is eager to buy Macy's Credit, and Taubman leases  tons of space to Macy's stores. Still, those interests aren't enough to justify  a new $100-million investment. At least, I don't think they are.  </P> <P> If the stock purchase closes before year-end, anyone who cares about Macy's  will owe stockholders a rising vote of thanks, because they will be acting as  financial statesmen willing to take a risk without the commensurate rewards.  If, however, their money doesn't show up until 1991, these stockholders will be  the Milli Vanilli of finance -- a great show, but not much substance. Tickets,  anyone?  </P></p>

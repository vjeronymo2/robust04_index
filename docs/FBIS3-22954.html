They accused some central security elements attached to the  northern governorates and working at the Radfan Camp overlooking  Aden airport of preparing to carry out the mission of attacking  al-Bid's plane with "shoulder-fired RPG shells" when it takes  off from the airport.    They said that "Brigadier General Salih Munsir al-Suyayli,  governor of Aden and member of the YSP Political Bureau, ordered  the expulsion of the northern members of central security from  Aden to the north and the arrest of those who were planning to  carry out the attack on al-Bid's aircraft."    Furthermore, military sources in Aden say that "the forces  deployed in al-'Anad camp (80 km north of Aden) arrested two  Iraqis in the evening of the day before yesterday as they tried  to infiltrate the camp, which has a military airfield and some  installations." They added that "the Iraqis, who came from the  northern governorates, confessed that their mission was to  damage a number of military aircraft belonging to the army in  the south and to hijack two planes to Iraq."

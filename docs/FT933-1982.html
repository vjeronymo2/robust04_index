			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / International Capital Markets: Taiwan's central bank faces leak allegations CENTRAL Bank of China, Taiwan's central bank, has been accused of leaking information to five government-owned banks, allowing them to profit from insider bond trading, AP-DJ reports from Taipei. Hsu Tien-tsai, a legislator of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party, said the Central Bank should be held responsible. Mr Samuel Shieh, Central Bank governor, admitted the five banks were informed of cuts in reserve requirements hours before changes were announced on September 16. But Mr Shieh argued that the officials were advised in advance because he wanted them to cut prime lending rates following the Central Bank move. The Central Bank's reductions in reserve requirements, ranging from 0.75 percentage point to one full percentage point, applied to current accounts and other main deposits. The cuts sent the bond market into high gear on Friday, with 42 institutions offering bids totalling TDollars 623.4bn for government bonds worth TDollars 30bn.</p>

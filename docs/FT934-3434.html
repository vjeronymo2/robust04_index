			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Greek presidency plans early summit As European Union leaders prepare for their two-day summit in Brussels beginning tomorrow, a new special summit is already being mooted for early next year to try to conclude difficult negotiations on EU entry for Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway. Mr Theodoros Pangalos, the Greek alternate foreign minister who will chair the Council of Ministers when Greece takes over the EU presidency in January, says Athens initially plans a top-level meeting between prime ministers of the four applicants, Mr Andreas Papandreou, the Greek prime minister, and Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission. The Greek presidency would then call a special summit 'if the political will and conditions for a success are there', Mr Pangalos said. The EU has set an ambitious March deadline to finish the enlargement negotiations, essential if the four members of the European Free Trade Association are to become members by January 1995 as planned. But by early next year, the remaining obstacles to their entry will require 'settlement at a high level', Mr Pangalos believes. One of the main issues to be resolved is how to share the cost of compensating farmers in the four applicant countries for their far higher agriculture subsidies, which Brussels intends to align to EU prices. At the moment, the EU argues that the four should foot the bill. But senior EU officials recognise that tough negotiations will lead to a dividing up of the approximately Ecu2.2bn (Pounds 1.67bn) a year cost between the 12 and the four. A further complication, likely to surface at the Brussels summit this week, could come with changes in EU voting rules to accommodate the new entrants. Of the existing 12, the small member states are determined that the present weighted majority voting system in the Council of Ministers should simply be extrapolated from 12 to 16 members. The system now is that 23 votes out of 76 can block a proposal - or roughly two big countries and one small country. An arithmetical transposition of this system to a 16-member EU would mean 27 out of 90 or 92 votes would be needed to block decisions, meaning that two large member states would need to pick up at least two and sometimes three smaller allies. The big member states want a lower blocking threshold to preserve their influence. The UK is being particularly aggressive, arguing for retaining the 'blocking minority' at 23 votes. But some smaller member states, such as The Netherlands and and Ireland, say this will so alter the balance of power in the Union that it could end by breaking it up. The four candidate governments argue that a tilt in favour of the powerful would lose them the referendums on EU entry they are all committed to hold next year.</p>

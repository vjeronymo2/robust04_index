			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Markets Report: Mexican peso hits fresh low in volatile trading The Mexican peso was again the focus of attention yesterday as the government's decision to allow it to float freely drove the currency to a new low, writes Philip Gawith. This followed the government's decision on Tuesday to try and manage the peso's decline by announcing a 15 per cent devaluation. Yesterday's decision was a recognition that the speculative forces lined up against the currency were too powerful to be resisted. Trading conditions were thin and volatile, with investors nervous about the outlook. Spreads were very large, with the peso quoted at 4.6-4.8 to the dollar in the New York morning. It closed at 3.987 pesos in London on Wednesday. The Italian lira continued its slow recovery on news that Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, had resigned. It finished in London at L1,039 per D-Mark from L1,045. In thin trade, the Canadian dollar broke through Dollars 0.7147, its weakest level in more than eight years. Traders said investors were worried about Canadian fiscal and political issues. The US dollar was firmer, helped by a flight to safety from Mexico. It closed at DM1.5805 from DM1.5703 and at Y100.495 from Y100.17. In New York it eased back to end at DM1.5742 and Y100.25. Sterling had a steady day following its sharp overnight fall of around two cents against the dollar. Traders said this was a function of dollar strength, not sterling weakness. The pound closed at DM2.4417, from DM2.4491, and at Dollars 1.545, from Dollars 1.5597. In Germany, the Bundesbank council left interest rates unchanged. It did the same for the 1995 M3 money supply growth target, left at 4 to 6 per cent, as in 1994. The Mexican treasury secretary Mr Jaime Serra Puche said the free float of the peso would be allowed for a 60-day period. He said the government had decided, with business and trade union leaders, against permitting any price or wage increases during the period. Explaining the decision, he said: 'The financial authorities have decided that supply and demand will freely determine the rate of exchange until the currency markets show conditions of stability.' Mr Serra Puche revealed that reserves of the central bank, Banco de Mexico, had fallen to Dollars 6.5bn in recent days, following attempts to prop up the peso during recent bear markets. Mr Serra met with officials of the New York Fed and other banking and investment officials. Earlier the US and Canadian central banks had pledged USDollars 1bn and CDollars 1bn to support the peso, if necessary. A trader at a large New York bank said there continued to be a 'major exodus' from Mexico, although selling pressure was not as heavy as in the previous two days. She added that trading conditions were very thin. On deals of only Dollars 5m the spread was 20 centavos. Normally, though, 'Mexico was a market that could absorb Dollars 100m without a problem'. The trader predicted that the peso would probably settle at around 4.5 pesos to the dollar, although it could be a while before this happened. Analysts were puzzled at the sharp overnight weakness in sterling, which coincided with the announcement of the UK's first current account surplus since 1987. Mr Jonathan Griggs, economic adviser at Barclays, said markets were exceedingly thin, and technically driven. He said sterling had fallen through key chart points, prompted by dollar strength following the unrest in Mexico. Mr Tony Norfield, UK treasury economist at ABN-Amro in London, said there was little logic to sterling's decline, and he was reluctant to draw any conclusion about trends in such thin trading conditions. He surmised that one of the reasons sterling had been hard hit was that it was one of the more liquid currencies. Matters were not helped by an opinion poll showing the government to be the most unpopular in polling history. Traders said there had been negligible market response to the Bundesbank council meeting. Mr Tietmeyer repeated the Bundesbank line that it had the option both to raise and lower rates. His other main point was that monetary policy needed support from wages and fiscal policy. The Bank of England cleared a Pounds 1.2bn money market shortage in its morning operations.</p>

			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / International Company News: Thorn EMI set for Pounds 150m lighting sale THORN EMI is expected to demonstrate further concentration on its music and rentals business today when it announces the sale of Thorn Lighting division for about Pounds 150m. The purchaser is believed to be Investcorp, the Bahrain financed international investment bank which controls well-known businesses in the US and Europe. Thorn has been looking to refocus the group on its music and music publishing business worldwide and the international rentals business and to dispose of most of what the Thorn EMI name is historically linked. The sale of the lighting division will surprise some observers, however, who had thought Thorn was closer to selling its defence arm, possibly to GEC. Thorn Lighting has recovered well despite the recession, raising operating profits in the year to March to Pounds 15.2m (Pounds 12.6m). But given the division's exposure to the continental European market, the sale will be seen as a good deal for Thorn. 'If the deal does indeed go through, it looks as though the price is good,' said Mr Bruce Jones, analyst at Smith New Court. 'The deal accords very much with Thorn's strategy.' As Sir Colin Southgate, chairman, has developed that strategy of focusing on the music and rentals businesses, the City has increasingly speculated about a demerger once the defence and other non-core businesses are sold. There is no logical reason why music and rentals should be under the same roof. Smith New Court says that even with a conservative valuation of the the rentals business, the value of the sum of the parts should be greater than the combined Thorn EMI. Disposal of Thorn Lighting would follow the sale in April of it stake in Thames Television to Pearson, owners of the Financial Times for Pounds 57m and the sale of its fire extinguisher business to Williams Holdings in March for Pounds 41m.</p>

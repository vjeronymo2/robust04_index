			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Mac has the Gaul to oust Disney Mickey Mouse has been shunned in favour of something more Gallic in a new, French-inspired marketing drive for McDonald's restaurants across Europe. In place of their American confreres at EuroDisney, near Paris, the fast food chain has looked to Asterix and his friends for its new campaign. For the next few weeks, children who buy 'happy meals' of hamburger, fries and coke at McDonald's will be given one of four Asterix characters. 'Sometimes people think of us as a US multinational bulldozing our way in,' says Michael Boestam, marketing director for the company across Europe. 'McDonald's is an American concept, but we try to be as local as we can.' He says that most customers are locals, so it is important that the management in the company's franchises is local. Not only is the choice of decor left to individual managers, but there are also concessions to local tastes - such as salmon in Norway and large salad bars in Italy. Boestam says that Asterix is just one example of an increasingly local focus within Europe in recent months. 'He is one of the most known symbols in Europe,' he says. The promotion - geared to a new film, Asterix and the Great Crossing - follows an earlier campaign based around a well-known European toy, Lego. McDonald's has certainly not been shy in the past to use Walt Disney characters and other US themes in Europe. The Lion King, a Disney film, provided characters for a previous McDonald's promotion in Europe. So did two other Disney films: Aladdin and Beauty and the Beast. And for the future? Boestam says Disney characters are a 'possibility . . . but not definite'. Asterix wins out in Europe, at least for now.</p>

			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Trends indicate engineers not demoralised in UK Sir, Your correspondents, Nicholas Cox and T Taylor (Letters, September 3) paint an overly pessimistic picture of the current situation of the UK's engineers. The most recent salary survey carried out by The Engineering Council published in October last year, showed that the average earnings of chartered engineers had increased by 28.6 per cent over the previous three years to Pounds 31,768. Eight per cent of chartered engineers earn more than Pounds 50,000 a year. The survey also showed that the profession's self-confidence is recovering from the dip it took in the middle of the last decade. Four out of every five chartered engineers would now commend the profession as a career to a young man and only a few percentage points less would do so for a young woman - figures that contradict any notion of a generally demoralised profession and confirm its enlightened attitude towards promoting itself as a career option for women. As for innovation, there are several bodies operating in this area and it would not be to anyone's benefit to duplicate those efforts. However, at the younger end of the scale, where we have a free hand, the Engineering Council's Young Engineers for Britain competition this year attracted more than 700 entries, double last year's total. Many of the professional engineering institutions also have extensive programmes of seminars and conferences providing education in relevant technical and managerial issues. No one can deny that the UK's manufacturing base has been hard hit in recent years. But there is still much constructive activity aimed at counteracting that trend on the part of the engineering profession and there are positive reasons why engineering is an attractive, stimulating and rewarding career option.

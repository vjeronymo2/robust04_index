			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> A LENDER WHO IS STARTING SMALL;  </P> <P> BUSINESS LOANS: WESTERN GENERAL CAPITAL CORP. OF SHERMAN OAKS INVESTS PRIVATE  AND FEDERAL MONEY INTO SMALL FIRMS FROM LAUNDROMATS TO HERBAL TEA STORES.  </P> <P> Cheng-Hsung Tsai has suffered hard times since he and his family immigrated  from Taiwan seven years ago. His English is poor, so he had trouble finding a  job. In Taiwan, Tsai was manager of a garment factory, but in the United States  he could only find work in restaurants and carwashes.  </P> <P> A few years ago Tsai hit on the idea of running a coin-operated laundry  business, but he couldn't get a bank loan to help him get started.  </P> <P> Then Alan Thian entered the scene. Thian, 38, is president of Sherman  Oaks-based Western General Capital Corp., one of about 390 small business  investment companies (SBICs) throughout the nation that are licensed by the  federal Small Business Administration and are eligible for federal money to  make loans to start companies or buy investments in them.  </P> <P> With a $250,000 loan from Western General, Tsai recently bought two Laundromats  near downtown Los Angeles and replaced several of the 120 washing machines and  70 dryers with new, large-capacity machines that cost $5,000 apiece.  </P> <P> Thian said Tsai will take in about $480,000 in revenues this year, but the  company won't turn a profit for five years, when the loan is due to be repaid  in full. But Thian said he has faith in Tsai. "He convinced me he's very  hard-working," Thian said.  </P> <P> Thian, a Singapore immigrant, started Western General Capital a year ago. So  far, he has invested $1 million of privately raised money into three  coin-operated laundry businesses, a home builder, an herbal tea store and a  computer parts importing business. Under SBA rules, a new SBIC must raise at  least $1 million in private capital and invest at least 65% of it in small  businesses before qualifying for federal funds.  </P> <P> But by year-end, Thian hopes to start receiving the government funds, which he  can invest in companies with greater potential.  </P> <P> If he's lucky, Thian will find the next Apple Computer, which got its start  with help from an SBIC in the 1970s. On the other hand, SBICs are known as the  riskiest part of the SBA, and the number of SBIC liquidations has doubled in  recent years as the economy has soured.  </P> <P> The SBA is best known for its bank loan program, which guarantees about $3.7  billion a year in loans to small businesses. For SBA-backed loans, banks are  permitted to charge interest rates of up to 2.75% above the prime rate -- the  rate banks charge their most credit-worthy customers. That means banks can now  charge up to 12.75% for their SBA loans.  </P> <P> But for many small companies that don't qualify for bank loans, SBICs such as  Western General are the only alternative.  </P> <P> Under a complex formula based on their borrowing costs, SBICs now charge a  maximum interest rate of about 16%, although Thian has charged a 13% fixed rate  so far to his clients. SBICs are also limited to investing in businesses with  annual net income of $2 million or less.  </P> <P> Thian said Western General so far has made loans that have ranged from $100,000  to $300,000 and takes in about $11,000 a month in interest. After expenses, he  said, he shows a profit of about $6,000 a month.  </P> <P> Western General is chartered by the SBA to help businesses that are hampered  because of "social or economic disadvantages." There are 133 of these SBICs  nationwide and 26 in California. Western General is the only one in the San  Fernando Valley.  </P> <P> Thian got the idea to start an SBIC a few years ago. Since immigrating to the  United States in 1975, Thian has managed a family-owned restaurant, earned his  MBA at USC at night andinvested in real estate -- he now owns five houses in  the Los Angeles area. In 1982 he became a director of General Bank, a small  commercial bank in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> After serving on the bank's loan approval committee, "I found out there are a  lot of small businesses having trouble getting loans, especially minorities,"  Thian said.  </P> <P> Thian and six other bank directors put in $1 million and received an SBIC  license in August, 1989. He runs Western General out of a tiny office in  Sherman Oaks, and has two employees.  </P> <P> Thian plans to start taking investment positions soon in start-up companies,  but under SBA rules he's limited to investing no more than 30% of Western  General's private capital in a single company. His long-term goal is to raise  more private capital so that he can take bigger stakes in fledgling  manufacturing companies.  </P> <P> "When you have $300,000 you're getting into really small businesses like  coin-operated laundries. You're not really helping the economy that much," he  said. "But if I can help a business and help stimulate the local economy, that  will be a bigger achievement."  </P> <P> SBICs are eligible to receive up to four times their private capital in  matching funds from the SBA, up to $35 million. That means Western General is  now eligible for $4 million from the SBA.  </P> <P> Some billion-dollar companies, such as Federal Express and Intel, the computer  circuits concern, got started with the help of SBICs.  </P> <P> For example, an SBIC owned by Continental Illinois Bank invested about $500,000  in Apple Computer when it was starting up in 1978. After Apple went public in  1980, Continental sold its position over a two-year period for a $44-million  gain.  </P> <P> John Hines, the Continental SBIC's now-retired president, "became kind of a  legend in the industry after that deal," said Mike Kim, Continental's chief  financial officer.  </P> <P> But such success stories are rare among SBICs. Since the program started in  1958, 465 SBICs out of a total of 1,597 have been placed in liquidation after  defaulting on their payments. Since 1980, the backlog of the SBIC program's  liquidation portfolio has grown from $100 million to more than $500 million,  and the number of SBICs placed in liquidation has doubled in the past five  years.  </P> <P> "SBICs are the venture capital arm of the SBA," said Bernard Kulik, who runs  the SBIC program. "They're probably the riskiest single operation in the  agency's inventory."  </P> <P> Why are SBIC liquidations up? For one thing, many of the small companies that  SBICs finance hope to sell stock to the public eventually and use the money to  finance their growth. But Kulik said the market for new securities has never  fully recovered from the 1987 stock market crash, hindering many SBIC-backed  companies from raising enough money to keep operations going.  </P> <P> But officials admit that the SBIC program also suffers from internal problems.  In testimony before the Senate Committee on Small Business last month, SBA  Administrator Susan Engeleiter said SBIC problems also "result from spotty  government oversight and supervision of the program."  </P> <P> SBICs must have an independent audit done annually and must comply with certain  regulations, such as limits on the size of companies that receive financing.  But beyond that, it is up to each SBIC to decide which businesses it will  invest in. "We do not pass on individual investments," Kulik said.  </P> <P> The SBA also doesn't place any restrictions on ownership of SBICs, nor does it  offer a precise definition of "social or economic disadvantages." It does pass  approval on an SBIC's manager, but offers few guidelines as to who would  qualify.  </P> <P> Thian said he hopes to avoid the problems that have beset other SBICs by  picking businesses that produce steady returns, rather than trying to strike it  big with a high-risk technology or an oil and gas company.  </P> <P> He also said he's leaning heavily on the expertise of Chris Lin, chairman of  another SBIC, Myriad Capital Inc. in Monterey Park, which helped fund General  Bank.  </P> <P> Lin said he "got burned pretty bad" when he started Myriad 10 years ago by  investing in businesses with poor management, such as a seafood trading company  that failed because of the owners' lack of experience. Those early losses  taught him to carefully scrutinize an owner's background before investing, he  said.  </P> <P> With advice from Lin, Thian said he has refused loans to applicants who wanted  to start Laundromats because they lacked experience and their business plans  "just didn't make sense."  </P> <P> The businesses that Western General has invested in are all owned by Asian  immigrants. Thian said that's because he has only invested private capital so  far and initially turned to the community he knows best.  </P> <P> After he starts receiving government funds, Thian said he will start  advertising his services and "I'll extend loans to all nationalities and  races."  </P></p>

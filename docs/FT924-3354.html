			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Survey of Derivatives (2): It's time to know what's going on  -Why the regulators' eyes are fixed firmly on the OTC market HORDES OF government regulators across the globe are grappling with the question of how best to handle supervision of the over-the-counter financial derivatives market. Rarely can so many different agencies have taken up the same subject with so much enthusiasm. Among the institutions that have launched formal and informal studies of the market during the past year are: The New York Federal Reserve; the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and the General Accounting Office, all US watchdog agencies; the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), in Basle, which is working alongside the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (Iosco) on capital adequacy and accounting issues; the Bank of England; and the Group of Thirty, a consultative group of top bankers, financiers and academics from leading industrial nations. Why such keen interest in derivatives? One answer is that the over-the-counter market for financial instruments such as swaps, options, and forward rate agreements is lightly regulated by modern standards, particularly considering its size and rapid growth. Although the activities of individual players are monitored by their own supervisory bodies (US banks, for example, are answerable to the New York Fed, and securities houses to the SEC), no one body is in charge of the entire market. Opponents of derivatives in the US have tried to force the market into the domain of a regulatory body, but their best recent attempt at doing so failed two months ago when the Futures Trading Practices Act 1992 was passed. The act reaffirmed that swaps (which make up the bulk of over-the-counter derivatives business) are not futures contracts, and therefore do not have to be traded on established exchanges and are not regulated by the CFTC. Perhaps the most compelling explanation for the rash of regulatory inquiries is the perception, formulated over the past couple of years, that the regulatory authorities do not entirely know what is going on. While it is wrong to suggest that derivatives instruments are so complex that regulators cannot understand them, officials privately admit that the pace of innovation in the business means they have struggled to keep up with the market's growth, and its implications for risk in an increasingly global financial system. Moreover, it is the job of regulators to look at financial risk and consider how the system would cope in the event of a 'doomsday' scenario of confusion, chaos and collapse. In the case of the derivatives market, the regulators want to know what would happen if one of the biggest players in the market were to go under, creating a massive gridlock throughout the system as its many counterparties struggle to replace their defaulted contracts. The problem with derivatives is that no one is entirely sure what would happen. So regulators are hurriedly trying to learn about the risks of the business (which is why JP Morgan held a series of well-attended derivatives seminars for regulators during the summer). The main risk that concerns them is credit risk - what happens when a counterparty to a contract defaults on its payments. In the US, the participants in the market have gone furthest towards addressing credit problems by drawing up the International Swap Dealers Association (Isda) master agreement, a flexible, all-purpose document that allows an intermediary to reconcile all of its transactions with a defaulted counterparty and come up with a final net payment. This practice of netting has become a crucial factor in the growth of the derivatives market. Bankers say that not only does it reduce credit risk, it also means that if capital adequacy rules are applied to the net, not gross, value of transaction payments, participants in the business can reduce the amount of capital they have to put aside to support the business by as much as 50 per cent. The central problem with netting, however, is that its status as a legally recognised practice is only ensured in the US. In non-US jurisdictions, no one knows if the Isda master agreement and netting would hold up in a bankruptcy court. The BIS has given netting its unofficial seal of approval, but only in a somewhat hedged manner. The Lamfalussy Report, in November 1990, concluded that bilateral netting was 'virtually certain' to be legally binding in all Group of Ten countries. The derivatives industry seized on the finding as proof that netting would work. Yet regulators point out that the Lamfalussy Report also expressed reservations, saying that no single form of bilateral netting arrangement exists which will work in every jurisdiction, primarily because each contract has to be tailored to fit the bankruptcy law under which it is designed to operate. This thorny issue is currently being looked at by a BIS sub-committee. It is looking into credit-related risk, which includes both bilateral and multilateral netting. This dual approach has disappointed some industry observers, who claim that the investigation of multilateral netting - a technique which would require the establishment of a central clearing house and is probably many years away - is holding up the inquiry into bilateral netting and should be kept separate. A second BIS sub-committee is looking into market-related risk - what happens to derivatives in the event of sudden and dramatic shifts in market prices and conditions. One central banker categorised this study as an effort to understand how market risk can be incorporated more fully into current risk-adjusted capital structure, which is primarily designed to account only for credit risk. Both sub-groups are still conducting their studies. The market-risk group's investigations are currently stalled, because of differences between national regulatory agencies, while the credit-risk group is waiting to see what the BIS supervisors committee has to say on the subject. As one senior central banker admitted, any action on netting from the BIS is 'not months, but years away.' The market's participants are left grinding their teeth in frustration at the delays. Mr Mark Brickell, a former Isda chairman and member of JP Morgan's emerging markets group, believes that the quicker netting is recognised the better. He says: 'We'll have a less risky system when more transactions are put under these (netting) agreements.' While international regulators like to view derivatives on a global scale, and look at the systemic risks in the business, they are also worried about practices at individual banks and securities houses, and whether they are being adequately monitored by the authorities. The Bank of England, for example, is currently conducting its own study into both over-the-counter and exchange-traded derivatives, to find out more about the new instruments in the market, and to discover whether the banks and securities houses that design and trade them, and the corporate customers who use them, fully understand the risks they are taking. In this respect, some regulators are particularly worried that, as the margins intermediaries earn on the simpler, more established, products decline in a maturing, more competitive market, some banks and securities houses may be rushing into more complex, esoteric instruments where the returns are higher, but where the risks are less well understood. Perhaps the greatest worry is that the senior management and boards of directors of these companies do not know what is happening. As one senior regulator puts it: 'We feel that some directors are not wholly comfortable with derivatives, and they don't know anybody who they can trust. There is a gulf between the top and medium level that is not being wholly bridged.' It is a point echoed by another central banker, who accepts that, while many derivatives involve risks that bankers are familiar with, the newer, more complex instruments which combine risks in a single product, transform those risks in a way that is unfamiliar to senior bankers. This concern that innovation is getting out of hand was best expressed in the now notorious speech to New York bankers, in January, by New York Fed chairman Mr Gerald Corrigan. Mr Corrigan's comment that 'hi-tech banking and finance has its place, but it's not all that it's cracked up to be' was clearly aimed at the sharp end of the business, where the pace of innovation is most hectic. In its defence, the industry argues that only a small proportion of the total derivatives business involves the new hi-tech instruments that regulators, legislators and the press make such a fuss about. Derivative specialists also say these new products are less complex than they look, that most are variations on a theme - primarily different combinations of risk-management instruments, combinations easily broken down into component parts that have been used and understood for years. Industry insiders also decry the notion that senior management does not understand what their derivatives people are doing. While some accept that, in the early days, the view that 'rocket scientists were bamboozling management' may have been partially valid, the level of awareness and understanding of the business is said to be much higher today. Furthermore, Mr Malcolm Basing, current head of Isda, questions whether senior managers should be expected to know every detail of the derivatives business. After all: 'How many people at GM who make motor-cars understand the engineering of the motor in details, or how a catalytic converter works?'</p>

			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Survey of Design in Europe (7): The family dog goes out of fashion - John Ridding finds renewed competitiveness and flair in European car design When Mr Patrick Le Quement, head of design at Renault, sought to persuade the company chairman to go ahead with the Twingo, he told him that he planned to develop a car which would 'put the family dog out of fashion.' One year after the launch of the quirky mini-car, 200,000 of man's best friends may be wondering whether to seek a new kennel. The commercial success of the Twingo is evidence of a renaissance of innovation, and a degree of risk-taking, at the French state-owned car group. But it also stands as a symbol of a renewed competitiveness of European car design after a period of assault by international rivals. 'There are some very attractive products at the moment,' says Mr Le Quement, citing the Opel Corsa, the curvy small car which is devoid of straight lines. For Professor Dan Jones at the University of Cardiff business school, the Vauxhall Calibra is another triumph. 'It got them away from the sales rep image,' he says. 'They have got an awful lot of mileage from the car.' Mr Roy Axe, managing director of Design Research Associates, the independent consultancy group, commends Rover, with its emphasis on British characteristics, BMW, and Mercedes. For many in the industry, the emergence of products such as the Twingo and the new Rover range marks a welcome response to the threat of international competitors - particularly from the Japanese constructors - and the end of a period of self doubt in European car design. 'Europe held the leadership in auto design until the 1980s, and then in the late 1980s the Japanese seized it by being more adventurous,' says Professor Jones. Mr Le Quement concurs. 'The Japanese took over and captivated the interest of the whole industry. The Europeans went through a patch of desperation and many felt they would never see better days,' he says, referring to the succession of concept cars developed by the Japanese in the 1980s and their success in penetrating traditional strongholds of European design, such as the sports car segment. That, however, was then. 'Today the situation has changed significantly,' says the Renault design chief. 'We feel that we have not been beaten by psychological warfare.' The reversal of fortunes is partly explained through the adoption of lessons learned from the Japanese themselves. In particular, European manufacturers have implemented team-based design techniques, resulting in increased efficiency and reduced costs through the combination of styling and engineering processes in the development of new models. The Europeans have still not caught up with their eastern rivals in this area, but the gap has narrowed, allowing broader ranges of vehicles and greater responsiveness to customer tastes. The increased design competitiveness of many European manufacturers also reflects their adoption of a strategy of emphasising the distinctiveness of their particular products, rather than attempting to appeal to the broadest possible number of consumers. As the Massachusetts Institute of Technology warned in its book The Future of the Automobile: 'It is clear that product distinctiveness is the major competitive advantage of the European producers, and they will lose it only at great risk.' This thinking is clear in the case of the Twingo. 'It is better to adopt a strategy of pleasing wholeheartedly a smaller number of people than to try and avoid displeasing everyone,' says Mr Le Quement, dismissing the idea of a world car which can suit all tastes. 'That is a myth, like Euro-camembert or Euro beer,' he says. Part of this strategy involves an emphasis on nationalism in design. Rover's renewed success, for example, is partly the result of an emphasis on its Britishness, from the wooden dashboards to the regal grille on the front of its more recent cars. The quirkiness of the Twingo also harks back to a tradition of French innovation, from the Renault 16 - the first car to have a modular interior - to the Citroen DS, the shark-like saloon with swivelling headlights, hydraulic suspension and steering. 'We took the approach of re-establishing our design as a French manufacturer rather than a Euro manufacturer,' says Mr Le Quement. 'We believe the richness of the culture is what makes Europe and we reject the idea of trying to do the best average.' Not all constructors agree. Ford of the US, for example, is a strong advocate of the world car, designed to appeal to a mass international market and achieve huge economies of production. 'If the Ford approach works then it is frightening,' says Mr Le Quement. Notwithstanding this challenge, however, the increased diversity of European design deprives international rivals of a unified target. 'In the 1980s Europe was drawn towards a standardised product line, off which were developed different versions. The result was that cars became similar and boring and presented an easy opportunity for the Japanese', says Professor Jones. The Miata MX5 sports car, and the Toyota Lexus, aimed to compete with Mercedes and BMWs, came as a 'profound shock' to the European producers, he says. But if the Europeans have been strengthened by a more adventurous approach to design, the battle is not yet won. The Americans, and Chrysler in particular, are becoming increasingly competitive. 'The Japanese reached a kind of a plateau,' says Mr Axe of DRA. 'They need to find a focus again, and I am sure they will.'</p>

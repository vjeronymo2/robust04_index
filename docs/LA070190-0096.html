			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LOVING AND LOSING A CHILD OF ADOPTION  </P> <P> Two days ago a family was told they must give up their 17-month-old son to his  birth mother. As a prospective adoptive mom, I can't imagine the horror this  child's adoptive parents are going through.  </P> <P> I am outraged.  </P> <P> This is an issue that pro-choice and pro-life forces can join together on. It  is also an issue on which birth parents and adoptive parents can agree. It is a  matter of being pro-family and pro-child.  </P> <P> Families, like my husband and I, who tried for years to have a child are so  eager to love and cherish our adopted children. They are no different to us  than any biological child. They are our children.  </P> <P> Why, after struggling for so many years and suffering disappointment after  disappointment, must we be afraid that a birth mother can after six months'  time (or in this instance 17 months) take our child away from us?  </P> <P> Think of the impact on the child. He is being ripped away from his loving  parents to go live with someone he doesn't even know.  </P> <P> The biological process of conception is not what makes you a parent. It is the  wonderful hours rocking the baby to sleep, playing with the baby, feeding the  baby, staying awake at night when the child has a cold, seeing the first smile.  </P> <P> This issue is not anti-birth parents. We want to tell our children that their  birth parents loved them and made a very difficult but loving choice. Loving  their children, they should want their child to have the best that life has to  offer.  </P> <P> ELLEN LISTON  </P> <P> Trabuco Canyon  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEBATE OVER CENSORSHIP OF THE ARTS  </P> <P> Krauthammer's column epitomizes the mentality of the reactionary conservative  right. Congress, by seeking to qualify the NEA bill, does indeed censor art  because, as a sanctioned authority, it imposes its view of what is and what is  not art on the populace.  </P> <P> Krauthammer's idea for a "Himmelfarb Amendment," which would support only "old,  established art," can only be seen as the most dangerous of reactions to the  avant-garde. He, like the right, chooses to live in a past that is safely  understood and offers no surprises or discomforts; yet he seems to forget that  aesthetic opinions of Rachmaninoff, Beethoven and similar artists have been  forged in part by the benefit of years of hindsight. These artists' works  inspire because they dared to do something radically different in mediums which  threatened to stagnate.  </P> <P> ANDREW GENTES  </P> <P> Riverside  </P></p>

Perriss, a resolute Conservative, is also chairman of Zenith Worldwide Media, the media-buying arm of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, the advertising agency that originated the slogan 'Labour isn't working'. Dorrell's civil servants will keep him abreast of the IPA's views. But who will keep Major informed about the feelings of his supporters?</p>

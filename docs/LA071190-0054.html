			<p><P> July 11, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> CITY, COUNCILMAN END CARPORT DISPUTE  </P> <P> Councilman John McWherter resolved a lawsuit with the city of Ventura over a  portion of a carport that the councilman unknowingly built on city property.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, Superior Court Judge Edwin Osborne ruled that McWherter could buy  the city land underneath the carport and adjoining slope for $5,000, the  councilman said.  </P> <P> "I'm glad it's all over," McWherter said after being told that the court had  put an end to his sticky, 3-year-old dilemma.  </P> <P> Under state law, elected officials cannot enter into contracts with the cities  they represent. So McWherter was barred from buying the carport property from  the city without a favorable court decision.  </P> <P> McWherter discovered that his carport was on city property in October, 1987,  when a city crew surveying nearby property found that land maps had been  improperly drawn.  </P> <P> Faced with the option of either resigning from the council or tearing down his  carport, the 17-year council veteran came up with a better idea: he asked the  city to sue him over the rights on the carport property. On Tuesday, McWherter  said the judge decided that "state law does not apply on a case like mine.  Thank goodness." SANTIAGO O'DONNELL  </P></p>

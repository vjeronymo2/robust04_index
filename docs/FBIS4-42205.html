			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed FDS: "Claes Defends Rwanda Policy Before </F> Indifferent Parliament"]    [Text] Yesterday Minister Claes of the SP [Flemish  Socialist Party] replied at length to questions on Belgium's  policy on Rwanda before the Parliamentary Foreign Affairs  Committee. The number of MP's present in the chamber could at  times be counted on the fingers of one hand.    The debate on Rwanda was conducted entirely in Dutch -- with  the exception of one unintentionally absurd intervention by  Jean-Pierre de Clippele of the PRL [French-speaking Liberal  Party]. He argued for a geographic separation of Hutus and  Tutsis -- who share the same language and culture and who have  lived together for centuries -- "naturally allowing for the  maintenance of a form of central authority in Kigali, to manage  the railways for example." A Rwandan observer in the press  gallery gulped in disbelief: railways in the land of a thousand  hills?    Shortly after the evacuation of foreigners from Rwanda, DE  MORGEN was able to report -- on the authority of a member of the  government -- that cooperation in the field between French and  Belgian paratroopers was faltering. This was accompanied by  political differences of opinion: The French supported/support  the Hutu extremists who took over the government. The Belgians  are keeping their distance from the so-called interim government  -- which is slandering the Belgians -- and also the RPF [Rwanda  Patriotic Front] rebels.    Magda Aelvoet of AGALEV [Alternative Lifestyle] wanted to  know from Claes whether our report was right. "Pure invention,"  Claes replied without flinching, "on the contrary, we must  thank Paris for the help they provided. I have no knowledge of  French paratroopers refusing to rescue even one of our fellow  countrymen. People should refrain from spreading such rumors  and present concrete facts."    Aelvoet, followed by Marc Van Peel of the CVP [Flemish  Christian Democratic Party], then denounced the UN for not doing  enough to stop the bloodshed. She also argued that Belgium too  is keeping its head down. A misconception, stated Claes: "It  would be difficult for Belgium to take the lead: The  anti-Belgian campaign extends to the refugee camps." But that  is not stopping Belgium from trying to set up a regional peace  conference -- "and in this connection I must refute any  suggestion that we would oppose the presence of Zaire at such a  conference. Quite the opposite in fact, although we do not  believe that Zaire can play a leading role due to the major  transfer of weapons and ammunition from Zaire to Rwandan  troops." In any event, Claes does not consider any large-scale  UN intervention in Kigali to be realistic. Belgium continues to  support "the spirit of Arusha" based on national reconciliation,  respect for human rights, and democratization. And Belgium is  already providing several hundred million francs in aid. "We  remain prepared to contribute to the reconstruction of the  country and to relieving the enormous human needs."    A final subject of dispute was Belgium's visa policy.  Belgian embassies in neighboring countries are only granting  visas to Rwandan refugees who can establish that they have close  links with Belgium, while other countries are being more  generous, stated Aelvoet. "Be careful," replied Claes, "our  embassies obviously take the necessary precautions in order to  prevent those responsible for the killings from finding refuge  in our country."    Aelvoet remained unconvinced. The minister: "And of course  our embassies also consider where these refugees could go when  they arrive here, without having to immediately turn to welfare."</p>

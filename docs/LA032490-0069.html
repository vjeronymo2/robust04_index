			<p><P> March 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESEARCHER TO CLARIFY TIES TO DRUG COMPANY;  </P> <P> MEDICINE: JOURNAL WILL FOLLOW UP UCLA DOCTOR'S EDITORIAL ON VACCINES WITH  STATEMENT HE IS CONSULTANT TO A FIRM THAT MAKES THEM.  </P> <P> A prominent UCLA researcher, who wrote an editorial dismissing the likelihood  of neurological illness from pertussis vaccines, will publish a clarification  noting that he omitted mentioning he is a paid consultant to a vaccine  manufacturer.  </P> <P> Dr. James D. Cherry, a professor of pediatrics, agreed to the clarification  after the Journal of the American Medical Assn. learned that he failed to make  the kind of financial disclosure required of journal authors since last  October.  </P> <P> "Dr. Cherry's financial disclosure was incomplete, and we will be publishing  his statement of clarification in the next available issue of JAMA," John  Hammarley, science news editor for the American Medical Assn., said Thursday.  </P> <P> Cherry, a longtime vaccine researcher, is a consultant to Lederle Laboratories,  one of two U.S. manufacturers of the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP)  vaccine. He has also received hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of  research grants from Lederle and other firms.  </P> <P> In the editorial, published Friday in the journal, Cherry endorsed the  conclusions of a paper published elsewhere in the issue in which researchers at  Vanderbilt University studied 38,000 vaccinated children and found no increased  risk of seizures. One of the authors of that paper also failed to disclose his  ties to Lederle.  </P> <P> Cherry said he chose not to mention his ties to Lederle in the disclosure  statement he submitted to the journal. In an interview Thursday, he said he  believed such a disclosure was not necessary since the editorial concerned DTP  vaccines in general, not one in particular.  </P> <P> "This particular editorial relates in no way to a specific manufacturer, it  relates to pertussis vaccine," Cherry said. "Anybody who has done any research  in fields like this has done contract studies with various companies.  </P> <P> "When I signed this thing, I actually thought about it, and I read it sort of  carefully because I know this is a sensitive area," he said. "As it turns out,  I did think about this. I thought this is generic, not really specific."  </P> <P> The issue arose this week when a reporter for a Boston television station  learned of Cherry's ties to Lederle and his failure to declare them. The  reporter, with WHDH-TV, contacted Cherry, who says he then contacted the  journal.  </P> <P> Since October, the journal has required all authors to identify "any  affiliation or financial involvement that may be considered a conflict of  interest." The new policy was prompted by a growing national concern about  ethics in biomedical research.  </P> <P> Disclosed information may or may not be published along with the author's  paper. The journal's editors decide whether the information is important for  readers.  </P> <P> Dr. Edward A. Mortimer Jr., a co-author of the Vanderbilt paper, acknowledged  Thursday that he, too, failed to disclose he is a paid consultant to Lederle.  As with Cherry, he said Lederle pays his university, and the money goes back  into research, not into his pocket.  </P> <P> Mortimer, whose case has not been brought before the JAMA editorial board,  pointed out that most experts in the field have ties to companies.  </P></p>

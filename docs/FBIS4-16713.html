			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Dmitriy Kuznets under the "Inspection" rubric: </F> "All Quiet in Kalmykia. It Waits for Subsidies and Purges"]    [Text] A State Duma commission that went to Kalmykia to  inspect the situation there had to state upon its return that  this Republic, a component of Russia, is nearly the Federation's  most stable region. No major political disturbances connected  with the adoption of a new fundamental law of Kalmykia --the  Great Steppe Code [Velikoye Stepnoye Ulozheniye] -- have been  recorded.    The sense of the innovation, which the Constitutional  Conference, partly formed by Kalmykia President Kirsan  Ilyumzhinov himself, actually copied from the Russian Federation  Constitution, consists in the Republic's foregoing its  sovereignty in order to receive subsidies from the federal  budget. In the opinion of Duma Deputy Vladimir Lysenko, "all  attempts by Mr. Ilyumzhinov to reform Kalmykia's economy boiled  down to an international airport project and promises to give  each resident a Mercedes. In Africa, too, every leader tries to  build an airport the first thing," Mr. Lysenko pointed out. The  Republic's economy has really been destroyed down to its  foundations. Its basis -- sheep breeding -- has run into the  severest crisis caused by the absence of demand for Kalmykia  oil. Even the introduction of new customs duties, actively  lobbied for by Kalmykia and Tuva, have failed to revive the  Republic's economy. Subsidies remain the only way out of the  situation that has taken shape. Thus, as members of the Duma  commission pointed out, Mr. Ilyumzhinov has restrained his  arrogance and finally decided to "get down to real business."    The opposition, which hampered the passing of the Steppe  Code, is small. It is centered in Kalmykia's capital, Elista,  and pertains to the sections of top civil servants. The Duma  commission recorded "antidemocratic" moods in Kirsan Ilyumzhinov  and his supporters, who are going to conduct purges in the  Republic's power structures.</p>

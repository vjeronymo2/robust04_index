			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> PROPOSED COUNTY ORDINANCE CALLS FOR BAN ON PARKING CARS IN YARDS  </P> <P> A car's place is in the driveway, the garage or -- if it is broken down -- in  the junkyard.  </P> <P> That was the message delivered last week by county planning officials, as they  recommended approval of an ordinance that would prohibit drivers from parking  cars in their front yards and reinforce an earlier law that bans homeowners  from keeping old junkers on their properties.  </P> <P> The proposed ordinance won unanimous approval Thursday from the Los Angeles  County Regional Planning Commission. The County Board of Supervisors is  expected to consider it within a month. If approved, it would affect  unincorporated communities from Bassett in the San Gabriel Valley to Lennox in  the South Bay and Walnut Park in the Southeast area of the county.  </P> <P> Keeping junk cars and parking on the front lawn have been viewed in some  circles as property rights. But homeowners' associations and real estate agents  argue that the practices are tacky and hurt property values.  </P> <P> Members of the Walnut Park Community Assn. said they have been complaining for  more than five years to the county, the Sheriff's Department and, finally, to  the Department of Regional Planning.  </P> <P> "At some houses, there are junk cars parked one right after another from the  back of the property right out to the street," said Floyd Dominguez, president  of the community group. "Some of them have pickup trucks with differentials and  other junk sticking out. It looks terrible."  </P> <P> Dominguez said his group learned that neighboring cities had laws to control  where vehicles are parked but that county statutes were not as well spelled  out.  </P> <P> Although the county code prohibits property owners from keeping "inoperable"  vehicles on their properties, the term was never defined. Prosecutors had a  difficult time enforcing inoperable-vehicle citations because the law was not  clear, Deputy Dist. Atty. John Bax said.  </P> <P> The ordinance recommended by the commission last week defines such a vehicle as  any that cannot operate legally on a state highway. It also specifically bans  parking cars, whether broken down or brand new, in front yards.  </P> <P> Car enthusiasts protested the proposed ordinance earlier this year. They said  the ban on inoperable vehicles would prevent them from pursuing a legitimate  hobby: rebuilding and restoring classic cars.  </P> <P> County planners responded by including in the ordinance an exemption for  historic or special-interest vehicles.  </P> <P> Ray Beggs of the Assn. of California Car Clubs told the commission Thursday  that the exemption satisfies most of the concerns of car collectors. Beggs said  he remains concerned that some county code enforcement officers may not be able  to distinguish a collector's car that is under repair from a clunker.  </P> <P> "A lot of the success of the ordinance will depend on the discretion exercised  by the individual inspectors," Beggs said.  </P> <P> Commissioner Lee Strong said he is worried that the exemption will permit those  with broken down cars to avoid citations by claiming the cars are historic or  special vehicles.  </P> <P> "We are making changes for every little group," Strong said, "and,  unfortunately, we are creating an ordinance that isn't any better than what we  already have."  </P> <P> Under the proposed ordinance, penalties would remain the same as they are under  existing law. Offenders are issued a citation, with a fine of about $100, on  the first offense. Penalties increase after that.  </P></p>

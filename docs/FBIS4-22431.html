			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Irina Vladykina under the rubric "Elected </F> Representatives": "Russia's Choice Has Defeated the `Patriots'  in the Struggle for the Legislative Assembly of Perm Oblast"]    [Text] Perm--Some 34.4 percent of the population took part  in an election of deputies to the legislative assembly of Perm  Oblast. A single deputy was elected and named in each of 37 out  of 40 districts. The fact that seven candidates from the  Russia's Choice bloc were elected, defeating the Patriots of  Russia bloc which conducted a very vigorous preelection  propaganda campaign, became something of a sensation.    The new public association Region also met with failure:  Only  two out of 21 candidates were elected; the renaissance of the  Kama area--the development and execution of a long-term program  for socioeconomic renewal of Perm Oblast--was proclaimed to be  its main objective.    If you read attentively the list of 37 elected deputies, you  will understand that in the course of this election the vote was  in favor of individual fellow citizens rather than parties:  Almost all are the supreme officials of administrations,  enterprises, banks, and hospitals; they are people who are known  in the oblast. There are many representatives of the local  executive authorities among them: Vladimir Fil heads the  administration of Perm, Nikolay Poluyanov--Permyakia; Mikhail  Bystryantsev is chairman of the Perm Oblast Soviet. More  deputies than ever, nine, were elected from among bankers and  entrepreneurs. They include Vladimir Khlebnikov, president of  the Perm Commodity and Stock Exchange, Yuriy Trutnev, general  director of the Eks-Limited industrial and financial group, and  Grigoriy Barshevskiy, president of BiS-Credit Bank. The director  corps, agrarians, and representatives of humanitarian  professions--physicians and teachers--are widely represented.    The second round of voting will be held in 12 weeks in the  districts in which elections were not validly held. The amount  of 2 billion rubles was spent for the elections, three-quarters  of which was allocated from the federal budget, and the  remainder--from the local budget.</p>

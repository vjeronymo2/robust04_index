			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Companies expect small rise in sales: Confidence has 'failed to materialise' - Drop in production adds to recovery doubts BRITISH companies expect only a modest increase in sales over the next three months, with lower orders and profits hit by bad debt, Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the business information group, reported yesterday. The company said its latest business confidence survey showed few British companies felt business would improve substantially in the present quarter. Although the overall picture is stronger than last year, recovery prospects are weak, with companies worried about low turnover, poor cashflow and strong competition. 'The expected confidence boost for UK companies from the government's re-election in April has failed to materialise,' said Mr Philip Mellor, D &amp;B's marketing manager. 'There is now no certainty of the recovery getting fully under way before 1993.' D &amp; B said the retail and construction sectors are hesitant, and singled out bad debts as a 'brake on the recovery'. Retailers hope for higher sales but expect lower profits. They are expected to continue destocking and price discounting. In the construction sector there is an even balance between companies expecting higher and lower sales. But expectations of profits, prices and employment point downwards. Mr Mellor said there was a 'downward spiral' caused by record business failures and companies writing off a percentage of their turnover in bad debt. This was eroding gross profits and the ability of companies to compete in the recovery. D &amp; B found that one-in-five companies were suffering from bad debts equivalent to more than 1 per cent of turnover. 'One per cent may seem a small fraction,' said Mr Mellor. 'But a firm with a Pounds 3m turnover and a 6 per cent net profit margin that loses 1 per cent of turnover in bad debts would have to find an extra Pounds 500,000 Pounds 30,000 write off.' D &amp; B interviewed 1,700 managing directors between June 12 and June 30 in the first of several business confidence surveys due this month. Its assessments on the economy are based on balances of positive and negative answers to questions about expected net sales, net profits, selling prices, employment, new orders, inventories and exports in the three months from the time of questioning. It found that, on balance, 30 per cent of companies expected sales to rise this quarter, compared with 13 per cent expecting a decline a year ago. However, a balance of only 10 per cent expected higher profits. Although this contrasted with the 30 per cent expecting a decline a year ago, it marked a decline in optimism from the beginning of this year. D &amp; B found that businesses in the south-west, east and north-east of Britain were among the most bullish on sales. The east Midlands was the most pessimistic region, while the west Midlands was probably the most optimistic, in spite of expecting a sharp rise in unemployment. Pressure on prices meant that businesses in London and the south-east were less hopeful about profits than elsewhere.</p>

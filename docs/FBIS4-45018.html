			<p>CSO     [Text] New Delhi, May 4 -- India has closed the financial  year 1993-94 with an export growth of 20.37 percent in dollar  terms, thus comfortably achieving the export target set for the  year.    The latest trade data released by the Ministry of Commerce  shows that against a target of $22.138 million set for the whole  year 1993-94, the country recorded exports of $22,173.06  million, marginally exceeding the overall export target for the  year. Exports during the full year 1992-93 were worth $18,420.49  million.    However, there was a significant increase in the imports too  which grew by 6.84 percent in dollar terms during 1993-94.  Official estimates show that imports would be worth $23,212.13  million as against $21,725.54 million during 1992-93. This also  further increases the trade gap to $1,039.07 million which had  been successfully brought down to the level of $600-$650 million  even earlier this year. Nevertheless, the trade gap is still  substantially less than the 1992-93 figure of $3,305.05 million.    According to the provisional estimates released by the  Directorate-General of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics,  in rupee terms, exports during 1993-94 were estimated at Rs  69,546.91 crores, 30.36 percent up from the 1992-93 level of Rs  53,350.54 crores.    Against this, imports were of Rs 72,806.01 crores during the  year against Rs 62,922.80 crores in 1992-93, showing an increase  of 15.71 percent. In rupee terms, the trade deficit declined  from Rs 9,572.26 crores in 1992-93 to Rs 3,259.10 crores during  1993-94.    The upsurge in imports this year has been mainly due to the  extensive concessions given to the industry on import duty in  various sectors. Imports registered a more than 50 percent  increase during March 1994 taking the overall import figure  higher up thereby increasing the trade gap to the present level  of almost $1.4 billion.</p>

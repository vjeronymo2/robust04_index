			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Alberto Pepe Leira] </F>   [Excerpts] Montevideo, 27 May (EFE) -- According to the  latest polls, former President Julio Maria Sanguinetti's  Colorado Party has increased its lead to 11 points for the  elections scheduled for 29 November in Uruguay.    The significant preference for the Colorado Party increased  after Sanguinetti achieved an electoral agreement with Senator  Hugo Batalla, the leader of the social democratic Party for  Government by the People, who will be the vice presidential  candidate.    According to the results of a nationwide poll by the  Consultants Team Company, the Colorado Party has 33 percent of  the preferences while 21 percent of the voters remain undecided.    After the establishment of most of the presidential  candidates, the Colorado Party has received the largest  percentage of preferences in the polls since February 1993.    The Colorado Party has maintained an upward trend after it  reached its lowest point--26 percent--in July 1991, one year  after the National Party (Blanco) administration of President  Luis Alberto Lacalle was installed.    The Blanco Party, which is in the government for the third  time this century, has received the lowest preference rates of  its history, with 13 percent in December 1992 and 17 percent a  year later. [passage omitted]    The leftist coalition Broad Front comes second, but its  popularity has dropped from 25 to 22 percent between April and  May.    The coalition, established in March 1971, has been losing  votes in Montevideo, its traditional electoral stronghold,  during the past few months. [passage omitted]</p>

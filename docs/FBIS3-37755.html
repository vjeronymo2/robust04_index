An understanding was reached  Monday during telephone talks between President Saparmurad  Niyazov of Turkmenistan and the Georgian leader Eduard  Shevardnadze, a spokesman for the Georgian leader has informed  Interfax.    The spokesman said that Georgian Prime Minister Otar  Patsatsiya is expected to visit Ashgabat this week to continue  the talks on postponement of the Georgian gas-supply debt to  Turkmenistan.    By different estimates the debt amounts to $100-400 Mn.    Meanwhile, the energy crisis in Georgia has reached a peak.  For two days, the republic was only supplied with a minimal of  electric energy owing to the accident at the Tbilisi  hydro-electric station. Metro, TV and radio stations did not  work in Tbilisi. There is no water supply in Tbilisi homes.  Telephones are on the blink.    The leader of the Georgian Energy Department Yuriy Chediya  has told Interfax that the Tbilisi hydro-electric station has  been repaired and supplies energy once again. The spokesman  said that the situation would be critical if gas supplies were  cut.</p>

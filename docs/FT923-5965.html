			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Toyota Motor suffers 40% decline TOYOTA MOTOR, Japan's biggest automotive group, suffered a 39.7 per cent slide in worldwide pre-tax profits to Y427.9bn (Pounds 1.7bn) for the year to June as a fall in domestic car demand was compounded by foreign exchange losses and the cost of new domestic and British outlets. It was the second successive year of decline and Mr Tatsuro Toyoda, its president designate, said yesterday he expected no significant upturn in 1992-93. Although Toyota remains the most profitable private sector company in Japan, the performance was its worst since the present group was created through the merger of its manufacturing and sales arms 10 years ago. Revenues were 3.1 per cent ahead at Y10,163bn, passing the Y10,000bn mark for the first time. The company sold 4.51m vehicles during the year, down by 26,674 units, but margins at Toyota and its consolidated component suppliers and marketing offshoots were severely squeezed, and group operating income fell 56.3 per cent to Y218.5bn. Mr Toyoda said rationalisation measures had saved the company Y40bn during the year. This was more than offset, however, by Y56bn in extra depreciation charges. Toyota is building plants in northern and southern Japan and at Derby in the UK, and its accounting system loads such outgoings to the units' early years. The company also took Y100bn exchange losses due to the weaker dollar. In its US pricing, Toyota would 'closely observe what other companies do', said Mr Toyoda, but he suggested the Japanese domestic market could not at the moment absorb price increases. The company would further review its product range at home, perhaps placing more stress on affordable lines. For the Japanese parent company alone, pre-tax profits of Y375.9bn were down 34.6 per cent. Although sales rose 4.4 per cent to Y8,941bn, operating margins shrank to 1.4 per cent from 4 per cent. For the current year Mr Toyoda, who takes over as president next month, projected a 5.1 per cent rise in parent sales to Y9,400bn. Toyota is paying an unchanged dividend of Y19 from parent net earnings per share of Y53.97, compared with Y97.57.</p>

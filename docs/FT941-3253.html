			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Chicago win provides fillip for Clinton Congressman Dan Rosten-kowski, one of the most powerful members of the US House of Representatives, has won a fierce battle for the Democratic nomination in his Chicago district, aided by a campaign visit from President Bill Clinton last month. It was as much a victory for the president, struggling to put the Whitewater affair behind him, as for the chairman of the influential House ways and means committee. Mr Clinton took a gamble in supporting a congressman who has come under a political cloud because of an ongoing federal grand jury investigation of his finances that recalled old Chicago-style politics based on perks and patronage. At ways and means Mr Rostenkowski has been a faithful ally of Mr Clinton, overseeing the administration's most important initiatives - healthcare, welfare reform, and trade and tax bills. A member of Congress since 1958, Mr Rostenkowski's seat was for the first time thought to be in jeopardy in the three-man race for the nomination. In the end he won with 50 per cent of the vote. Mr Rostenkowski acknowledged the president's role in the win. 'There was a point, a pivotal moment in the campaign, when a very, very gutsy and honourable and courageous man named Bill Clinton came to town,' he told his supporters. 'I'm proud to be a soldier in the president's march for change.' Mr Rostenkowski may have hurt the president inadvertently when, in a television interview yesterday to discuss his victory, he said congressional hearings on the Whitewater affair are 'inevitable'. The affair concerns Mr and Mrs Clinton's financial dealings in Arkansas in the 1980s. Whitewater was the name of an Arkansas development in which the Clintons invested along with their friends Mr James McDougal, head of the Madison Guaranty savings and loan institution, and his wife. Madison failed at a cost to the taxpayer of Dollars 47m (Pounds 32.1m). Democrats have been fighting off Republican demands for congressional hearings, which would give the opposition more scope to equate the affair with the Watergate scandal.</p>

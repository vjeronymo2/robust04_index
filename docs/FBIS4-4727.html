			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 4 (KCNA) -- The April Spring  Friendship Art Festival will soon open in Pyongyang, the capital  of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.    Foreign artistes and acrobats and Korean artistes overseas  from five continents of the world will participate in the  festival.    It is a traditional art festival which has taken place every  year from 1982 in celebration of the birthday of the great  leader President Kim Il-song, the 15th of April.    The number of the art troupes and artistes participating in  the festival is increasing annually.    About 700 art and acrobatic troupes and tens of thousands of  artistes from the five continents have participated in the  eleven rounds of the festival held so far. Among them there  were hundreds of famous artistes including international contest  prize winners.    Last year, though a rigorous situation that might lead to a  war any moment prevailed in Korea owing to the frenzied moves of  the U.S. imperialists and their stooges for a war of aggression,  a large number of artistes of the world came to Pyongyang to  participate in the grand festival. They included the Chinese  symphony orchestra, a Cuban art troupe, folk song and dance  troupes of Russia and Ukraine and other art and acrobatic  troupes comprising international contest prize winners and  famous artistes and overseas Korean artistes.    The songs, works of instrumental music, dances and circus  pieces performed by them totalled more than 1,000.    Some 100,000 working people and artistes appreciated their  performances at theatres in the city.    Art troupes from various countries and now arriving in  Pyongyang.</p>

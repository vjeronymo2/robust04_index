			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Head of Government Mokdad Sifi, who is in  Brussels, met yesterday with his Belgium counterpart Jean-Luc  Dehaene. [passage omitted]    The head of goverment is expected in Paris later today. Our  colleague Noreddine Bouziane has sent us the following report  from Paris before the start of the visit:    [Bouziane] Head of Government Mokdad Sifi is expected in  Paris this afternoon. He will be coming from Brussels where he  has secured, according to the Belgian prime minister, an  economic aid package from Belgium.    Mokdad Sifi will be meeting at the Elysee Palace soon after  his arrival with French President Mitterrand. It is expected  that their talks will focus on the situation in Algeria and the  future of the dialogue between the authorities and the  opposition.    Sources close to the Elysee Palace have told us that  President Mitterrand will be reiterating to the head of the  Algerian Government the need to launch a dialogue with all  political forces in the country because France, according to the  same sources, believes that keeping the status quo will not  bring closer any opportunities to resolve the Algerian crisis.

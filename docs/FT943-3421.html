			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Canadian markets rise after separatists' narrow win Canada's financial markets rose sharply yesterday as investors took heart from the separatist Parti Quebecois' unexpectedly narrow victory in Monday's elections in Quebec. Although the PQ won 77 of the 125 seats in the National Assembly, it gained only 44.7 per cent of the popular vote, against 44.3 per cent for the outgoing Liberals. Bond and currency markets were buoyed by pointers that many Quebeckers voted on Monday for a change in government rather than for independence, and that the PQ may have an uphill battle gaining a majority in a referendum to decide whether the predominantly French-speaking province should remain part of Canada. Recent opinion polls show that close to 60 per cent of Quebeckers oppose outright independence but the PQ's leader, Mr Jacques Parizeau, reiterated his determination to press ahead with a referendum in 1995. Political observers and economic analysts cautioned that the referendum was likely to be preceded by a divisive campaign in which the new separatist government in Quebec City will be well placed to push its case for independence. The PQ has pledged to push a formal declaration through the Quebec legislature expressing a desire to begin sovereignty negotiations with Ottawa. It will also set up a commission to draw up an independence constitution. The PQ, which previously held office from 1976 to 1985, failed to gain a mandate in a referendum 14 years ago to negotiate a loose form of sovereignty for Quebec. It has indicated that it will pursue its goal more vigorously and unambiguously in the coming referendum. The Bank of Canada yesterday intervened to slow the rise of the Canadian dollar, which was trading at 73.84 US cents at noon yesterday, about three-quarters of a cent above Monday's close. The gap between the yield on long-term Quebec provincial bonds and government of Canada issues narrowed slightly. Canada's commercial banks responded to the improved markets by cutting their prime lending rate from 7.25 per cent to 7 per cent.

			<p><P> October 24, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> NOT OVER THE RAINBOW, BUT FUN  </P> <P> The Fullerton Civic Light Opera Company's "The Wizard of Oz" is so enamored of  the movie version, the 1939 fairy tale turned American institution, that it's  really a little beside itself.  </P> <P> While ably performed, this production never goes out on its own, happy instead  to give a live reflection of the film's beloved (and kitschy) moments. Calling  this show derivative is an understatement -- director Jan Duncan and  choreographer Sha NewmanQ duplicate the style and many of the moves they've  seen on the big screen, and most of their actors are pleased to impersonate the  stars, from Judy Garland to Bert Lahr.  </P> <P> Maybe that's enough (children will probably enjoy all the big-eyed, broad  performances and Popsicle-colored visuals; parents may find it all too  precious), but you do yearn for more invention. "The Wizard of Oz" seems to  present such opportunities, so it's disappointing when the inspiration is so  grounded in what has come before.  </P> <P> Perhaps Duncan thinks that it's wrong to tamper with a classic or worries that  any new romping would go against the audience's expectations. Whatever, she  does present the key moments in generally amusing ways, although we know  exactly what's coming and, after a while, how it's all going to be presented.  </P> <P> The pace often toddles, but the fairly elaborate set changes (Ed Gallagher's  scenery is not expensive-looking, but it is bright and vaguely hallucinatory),  Mela Hoyt-Heydon's bold costumes, the flying witches and steady handling of  Harold Arlen and E.Y. Harburg's well-known score can give pleasure.  </P> <P> Outside of not taking enough chances, there's really nothing to fault the cast  with. Rita Baretta presents a pretty, girlish Dorothy done up in gingham and  pigtails. Her singing is also pretty; she doesn't disappoint on "Over the  Rainbow."  </P> <P> Joe Fletcher as the Scarecrow, Randy Gianetti as the Tin Man and Daniel  Halkyard as the Cowardly Lion are pleasing as well, with comfortable voices and  characterizations. In heavy makeup, Polly Seale looks and sounds just like  Margaret Hamilton's original Wicked Witch of the West. Ray Erlenborn's Wizard  is an appropriately pompous bumbler.  </P> <P> The show relies on many children, who have been well rehearsed by Duncan. One  of the best scenes is reserved for the handful who play the Munchkins. They too  mimic their movie counterparts but do so with such earnestness that you can't  help but smile.  </P> <P> 'THE WIZARD OF OZ'  </P> <P> A Fullerton Civic Light Opera Company production of the stage adaptation of the  1939 movie, with music and lyrics by Harold Arlen and E.Y.

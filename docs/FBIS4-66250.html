			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by reporter Ye Shuiqiao (5509 3055 0829): "Quicken </F> Tempo in Reform for Rapid Economic Growth in China for 1994,  Forecast by Chief Economist of State Statistics Bureau Qiu  Xiaohua (6726 2556 5478)"]    [Text] The reform program and the national economy will be  rapidly developed, and all benefits quickly distributed. This  will be the social and economic situation in China during 1994.  For the 1.2 billion Chinese people who expect a great deal from  the reform program and wish to lead a comfortable life at an  earlier date, the year of 1994 is full of hope as well as  contradiction. This is the view expressed by the chief economist  of the State Statistics Bureau, Comrade Pan Xiaohua when he was  interviewed by our reporter.    The contents of the reform program, announced at the end of  1993 and gradually put into practice from the beginning of this  year, were quite rich. They involved banking, finance and  taxation, planning, investment system, economic affairs and  trade, pricing, marketing, social security, housing system,  enterprise management and other spheres. The current task of  reform will touch upon many areas in breadth and depth. It will  be difficult to carry out the reform with the adequate momentum.  Qiu Xiaohua believed that this year is a crucial year in which  the reform program should be promoted in an overall manner and  major breakthroughs be made. This year's reform differs from the  single-item reform project. It is an overall reform program  aimed at storing heavily fortified points, he added. If we fail  to foresee some problems on time, such problems may cause  relatively big shocks in society and create negative effects on  this year's economy. If we are able to timely discuss and deal  with these problems, and smoothly carry out the reform program,  our national economy should witness a rapid growth rate of  approximately 10 percent.    Since China entered the year of rapid economic growth in  1992, it has maintained a high-speed growth rate of  approximately 13 percent for two years running. This trend is  rarely seen in the world history of economic development. It is  similar to the speed attained by Japan and Korea during their  economic leap-forward. Right now, except for some individual  Latin American nations or Kuwait who is devoted in rebuilding  the nation because of the Gulf War, most the nations in the  world register an economic growth rate below 5 percent.  Therefore, China's strong momentum in economic development  during the past two years has aroused world attention. China  will definitely be able to keep this kind of momentum for a  period of time to come.    Qiu Xiaohua pointed out, China's economy went through three  stages in 1993 -- the stage of accelerated development during  the first half of the year, the declining stage during the third  quarter and the rebounding stage during the fourth quarter.  According to an estimate, even if China's economy rebounds at  the beginning of 1994, it should not be excessively high, and  even if it declines during that period, neither would be  drastic. Following the relaxation of the macro-regulation and  control, the economy will gradually pick up speed in developing  itself. However, there will be some fluctuations. It is possible  that this year we may achieve a high economic growth along with  a high rate of price increases, if we take into consideration  the after-effect of last year's rate of price increases (rate of  retail price increases approximately 13 percent) and the  potential pressure from the cost-push inflation. The speed of  economic growth in 1994 may be slightly lower than that of the  last year, and the commodity price maintained at last year's  level. If measures for exercising the macro-control are  excessively harsh, they may affect the smooth implementation of  a series of reform programs. Therefore, under the circumstances  in which our economy is rapidly growing, and complicated changes  in economic relations are taking place, how to control  inflation, prevent the commodity price from rising too sharply  and achieve the goal of quickening the tempo in carrying out  reform is an issue that the leadership at all levels should  closely watch, study and learn how to deal with.    In answering questions from our reporter about the factors,  both favorable and unfavorable to the healthy development of the  economic situation in China this year, Qiu Xiaohua pointed out  that there are mainly four favorable factors: 1) China is a  large nation with a population of 1.2 billion. It provides a  huge domestic market to help our economy grow rapidly.  Therefore, from an overall point of view, there exists no  question of insufficient effective demand. 2) The imbalance in  China's industrial structure and in its regional development  helps create many more new realms of growth. It is important to  eliminate the structural imbalance and help strengthen the weak  links in order to support the rapidly developing economy. The  backward areas must strive to change their outlook and catch up  with the rest of the country. This constitutes another factor in  promoting the economic growth of the entire nation. 3) With the  new system replacing the old, the old system will soon  disappear, and the new system will grow up. This procedure is  conducive to emancipating and developing the productive forces.  This is a long-term factor, not a short-term one. 4) Opening up  to the outside world is a basic state policy. Opening up means  to join the world market and participate in international market  competition. This itself provides China with a favorable  condition to promote its own economic development on an even  broader scale.    There are two unfavorable factors: 1) Pressure from the  inflation. After the macro-control was strengthened in 1993, the  commodity price was still quite high, although the rate of price  increases started to level off. This was the third year in which  prices had sharply increased. It would surely affect this year,  and it cannot be eliminated within a short period. 2) Risks in  carrying out reform. This year is a year in which we would  quicken our tempo in promoting the reform program. Reform is a  factor in supporting quick economic growth. At the same time,  there is also the issue of cost and risk in carrying out reform.  This issue is mainly manifested in the following aspects: On the  one hand, the new round of reform differs in nature from the  previous round of reform of expanding authority and transferring  profits. The previous round of reform had the nature of "giving  some benefits to others." All sectors may see immediate benefits  in the course of carrying out such reform. However, the new  round of reform is mainly a macro-economic reform aimed at  blazing a new trail by means of the system. Within a short  period of time, this round of reform would tend to increase the  burdens of all sectors. In order to protect their vested  interests, various sectors will hesitate to carry out such  reform wholeheartedly. According to a survey conducted by us  recently, various sectors are taking counter-measures to keep  the losses of their vested benefits to the minimum. Therefore,  we must fully realize the difficulties in carrying out this  current round of reform and the side effects that we might feel.  On the other hand, the new round of reform will be carried out  at a time when the government functions have not yet been  completely changed, and the government has not yet standardized  all its actions taken. If the government fails to carry out its  operations and supervise all the departments under its  administration in a proper way, some problems left by the old  system may crop up once again. This is because efforts are being  made to strengthen the role of the government at a time when the  government performs its functions irrationally and lacks a good  regular system. As a result, things that the government should  not control are being controlled, while those that the  government should strictly control are not controlled. As a  result, the inherent vitality in economic life is destroyed by  the government. Under the conditions of market economy, it is  necessary to strengthen the macro-control. To exercise the  macro-control is an important topic in developing the economy  and carrying out reform. However, if the principal body which  exercises the macro-control performs its functions irrationally,  it may create many negatives effects. This is something which  merits our attention.</p>

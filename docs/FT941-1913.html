			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: RPS shows 13% growth to Pounds 825,000 RPS Group, the USM-traded environmental consultancy, maintained growth in the second half of 1993 to end the year with pre-tax profits up more than 13 per cent from Pounds 727,000 to Pounds 825,000. Turnover was Pounds 7.52m, against Pounds 7.62m. Mr Roger Looker, chairman, said that 'as one of the leading companies in the sector with a strong balance sheet and positive cash balances, we will benefit from the inevitable increase in the importance of environmental issues.' Trading and cash flow in the first quarter of 1994 gave cause for optimism, he added. Cash flow was positive for the third successive year and overall cash balances were up by Pounds 631,000 and stood at Pounds 646,000 at the year end. The company paid off all remaining debt in the first half and had no debt at December 31. Earnings per share edged ahead from 4.82p to 4.87p, while a final dividend of 1.3p raises the total for the year to 2.4p (2.2p).</p>

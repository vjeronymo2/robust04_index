			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / UK Company News: CCS seeks support for reconstruction CCS Group, the building materials company, is planning a capital reconstruction which, if approved by shareholders and the High Court, would lead to a resumption in the trading of its shares on the USM. The shares were suspended at 2p and receivers called in during July 1991. The latest accounts, for the year to end-October 1992, showed that CCS has accumulated losses of Pounds 4.95m. These would be eliminated and a reserve of Pounds 17,000 created by a reconstruction which has two principal elements. Lloyds Bank is consolidating all its lending and accumulated interest into one loan of Pounds 351,801 and Midland Bank, owed Pounds 911,974, is converting Pounds 300,000 into preference shares carrying interest of 7 per cent initially and redeemable in five tranches and converting Pounds 100,000 into loan stock, while writing off the balance. CCS also plans to sub-divide its 20p shares into one 2p ordinary and one 18p deferred share, which will be cancelled. The share premium account of Pounds 624,000 will be cancelled.</p>

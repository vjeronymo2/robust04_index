			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Arts: Pioneer of public taste - William Packer admires Samuel Courtauld's impressionist collection, now hung in the Great Gallery of Somerset House At their former home in Woburn Square, collections in the Courtauld Institute's galleries were a close-kept secret. Their move in 1989 to Somerset House, William Chambers' classical masterpiece at the far end of the Strand, was expected to change all that. But there are still problems. The Strand is no longer the fashionable thoroughfare it was and, at the Aldwych end, has long been a forbidding one-way maelstrom. Sign-posting is, to say the least, discreet and the entrance facade of Somerset House itself is hardly welcoming, with its barriers and car-park overseers. That the courtyard beyond, potentially one of the great public spaces not just of London but of Europe, should be the private car-park of Her Majesty's Revenue Men is a scandal. Inside, however, things are looking up. The problems of heating and air-conditioning appear to have been resolved, albeit in somewhat ad hoc fashion in the short term, and much of the permanent hang has been rehung, to advantage. But the most significant change is the recent decision of the new director, John Murdoch, to return the Great Gallery on the top floor to its proper purpose as a prime exhibition space. There, at the top of the vertiginous staircase, where Rowlandson's rakes and beauties once heaved together at the Royal Academy's private view, we now have as our first taste of the new policy an exhibition given over to the eponymous Samuel, collector of French impressionism and pioneer of public taste. Samuel Courtauld, an industrialist who had made a great fortune out of the manufacture of rayon, became interested in impressionism on seeing the Lane Bequest at the National Gallery in 1917. He began to collect on his own account and by the end of the 1920s had acquired representative works by all the major impressionists and post-impressionists, and was especially strong on Cezanne and Seurat. He also endowed a purchase fund at the National Gallery, by which such things as Cezanne's self-portrait, Degas' 'Young Spartans' and 'Miss La La', Van Gogh's 'Chair' and 'Sunflowers', and Seurat's huge 'Bathers at Asnieres' came into public hands. This exhibition presents not just the cream of the paintings and drawings that comprise the Courtauld Bequest itself, but also brings together some of the works he gave away or left to friends and family on his death in 1947. There are three besides, all masterpieces, to represent the National Gallery's good fortune - Monet's 'Gare St Lazare', Renoir's 'Boating on the Seine' and Picasso's 'Child with Dove'. It is astonishing to stand thus surrounded by great paintings, and not a little envious at what one man was able to get for himself to enjoy - a pique barely assuaged by his conspicuous philanthropy in passing it all on to us. I have nothing against great art being held in private hands: I would only like to get my hands on some of it myself. The serious point is that true art, I am convinced, is charged up in a curious way, by being privily held and loved for a period before it moves into public limbo. How familiar so many of these things, which in the 1920s were a matter still of some controversy, have become to us. It was Courtauld who bought the Van Gogh 'Self-Portrait with a Bandaged Ear' for Pounds 10,000 in 1928, and not the National Gallery. He also bought Cezanne's 'Man with Pipe' for Pounds 7,500 in 1927, and 'Gravelines' by Seurat in 1926 for Pounds 3,100. The price of the ravishing Modigliani seated nude, bought around 1931, is unfortunately not known. These were difficult pictures still, at serious prices no doubt, but by no means exorbitant, even then. Renoir no doubt was safer (the exquisite 'La Loge', of the girl in black and white in her theatre box, got for Pounds 24,200 in 1925), and Manet too (his 'Bar at the Folies-Bergere' the prize of the collection, at Pounds 24,100 in 1926). But even so, these were capital works, manifestly museum paintings in prospect, and so many of them still available. All the prices known are given, which gives a fascinating gloss to the show. With the smaller works and drawings, this knowledge is even more piquant - Pounds 700 or so for a Seurat study of the riverbank; Pounds 282 for an ink-and-wash drawing by Guys of two fashionable women; Pounds 750 for Seurat's monumental chiaroscuro nude - but I cannot bear to go on. The drawings in their way are as well-judged as the paintings - Forain, Lautrec, Daumier, Cezanne. The dark pastel by Degas, of a seated woman seen from behind as she fixes her hair, is one of the best drawings that greatest of draughtsmen ever did.

			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / This Week: Sport FOOTBALL: European Champions League, November 23, IFK Gothenburg v Manchester United. Walloped 4-0 by Barcelona in their last game in Europe, United need to win this one if they are to stand a good chance of reaching the knock-out stage of the competition. Goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel is likely to miss the match, after injuring a back muscle in the warm-up before Saturday's 3-0 win over Crystal Palace - a victory that took United to the top of the Premiership. Schmeichel was replaced by third-choice 'keeper Kevin Pilkington, but Gary Walsh, who kept goal in the Nou Camp massacre, has recovered from a stomach problem and will be fit for Wednesday. Too much was read into the Barcelona defeat. The last time there was so much talk about English football lagging the game elsewhere in Europe, it preceded a run in which Liverpool, Nottingham Forest and Aston Villa totally dominated the European Cup.                           *      *      * CRICKET: Australia v England, Novemeber 25-29, 1st Test, Brisbane Their performance was 'pathetic.' So said the normally mild-mannered England team manager, Keith Fletcher, describing the tourists' dismal showing against an Australian XI (effectively a second national team of Test hopefuls) at the weekend - the final game before the first Test begins on Friday at the Gabba. Captain Mike Atherton agreed: 'We really haven't played well.' But Damien Martyn, Australian XI captain, yesterday refused to write off England in the upcoming Ashes series. 'They will still worry Australia,' he predicted. 'Graeme Hick and Graham Gooch look like being major forces for them and I rate both Alec Stewart and Michael Atherton.' Australia name their Test team today and, despite a glowing reference from Martyn, fast bowler Merv Hughes could miss out on selection. One of the main discussion points among the Australian selectors has been whether to recall Hughes, after he missed the recent tour of Pakistan. Hughes took 3-46 in England's first innings on Saturday, but is likely to be edged out of contention this week by Damien Fleming, Glenn McGrath and Craig McDermott, all of whom toured Pakistan.                           *      *      * RUGBY UNION: Wales v South Africa, November 26, Cardiff. The repercussions of South Africa's violent clash with Neath are still rumbling in Wales, and the Welsh Rugby Union is to study two videos of the match at a meeting tonight in a bid to resolve the matter. However, the Springboks will now have their minds on higher things. Francois Pienaar's side answered several questions when they beat Scotland 34-10 at Murrayfield on Saturday. They may be less eye-catching than Australia, less disciplined than England or New Zealand and less spontaneous than the French, but collectively they look a match for anybody.</p>

			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: MG to develop Quebec gold deposit Metall Mining, the international mining arm of Germany's Metallgesellschaft, has decided to develop the Troilus gold deposit in north-west Quebec. The mine, with a capital cost of about CDollars 150m, will start production in the third quarter of 1996, at the earliest. The development is subject to various regulatory permits and financing. Metall has also asked for government help in providing infrastructure. Output is expected to average 138,000 troy ounces of gold a year over 14 years at a cash cost of USDollars 222 an ounce. Mineable reserves are estimated at 49.2m tonnes of gold-bearing ore with a grade of 1.34 grams a tonne, as well as 1.29 grams a tonne of silver and 0.11 per cent copper. Metall said that an environmental review of the project was 'well advanced'.</p>

The entire report, as well as the complete record on which the initial decision is based, are available for inspection during working hours (9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.) in NHTSA's Technical Reference Library, Room 5108, 400 Seventh Street, SW, Washington, DC 20590. That record consists of the public files for EA92&hyph;041 and Defect Petition (DP) 92&hyph;016. The Executive Summary of the EA Report is set out below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Engineering Analysis Report_Executive Summary <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This Engineering Analysis was opened on December 8, 1992, as a result of granting a petition from the Center for Auto Safety (CAS) and Public Citizen to ``initiate a defect investigation into and recall all Chevrolet/GMC full-sized pickups (C/K-series) with fuel tank(s) *&blank;*&blank;* mounted outboard of frame rails.'' The objective of the investigation was to determine whether certain model year 1970&hyph;1991 Chevrolet and GMC full-sized pickup trucks contain a defect that poses an unreasonable risk to safety, related to the danger of fires following crashes, with primary focus on side-impact crashes. In the investigation, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) conducted analyses of real-world accident data and performed laboratory crash tests of the subject and peer vehicles. ODI also addressed questions related to the compliance of these trucks with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 301, ``Fuel System Integrity.'' Additionally, ODI examined whether the fuel tanks and related components on the trucks were unduly affected by corrosion that could make them more likely to be involved in a fire.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On April 9, 1993, ODI sent a recall request letter to General Motors Corporation (GM), recommending that GM conduct a safety recall on GM trucks with fuel tanks mounted outside the frame rails (subject vehicles). That letter was based on two principal factors:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Real-world accident data in the Fatal Accident Reporting System (FARS) indicate that there is an increased risk of fatality caused by fire in side-impact crashes involving the subject vehicles compared to 1973&hyph;1987 Ford full-sized pickup trucks. That increased risk led to an estimate that, in 1993, an additional 5&hyph;6 fatalities would occur in side-impact crashes involving the subject vehicles compared to what would occur if those trucks had the same side-impact fire performance as full-sized Ford pickups.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Laboratory crash tests corroborated the findings from the real-world accident data analysis. That is, in certain comparable side-impact crash tests, GM fuel tanks leaked and Ford tanks did not. Further, these tests used instrumented test dummies. Dummy measurements indicate that humans could have survived the crash forces at the impact speeds at which the subject vehicles leaked. While these speeds are well in excess of the impact speed specified in FMVSS No. 301, the results indicate the increased fire risk in the GM trucks in crashes that are otherwise survivable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> GM provided an extensive amount of data and arguments in response to the recall request letter. ODI has completed an exhaustive review and analysis of the GM submissions and has conducted a variety of additional analyses associated with issues involved in this investigation. These include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;An assessment of the effect of corrosion on fuel tank leakage and fire performance in the subject vehicles; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;An analysis of non-fatal burn injuries in side-impact crashes involving the subject vehicles;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;An in-depth review of all available police accident reports and other records of side-impact, fire-involved fatal crashes involving the subject vehicles to assess the crash conditions and severity of each;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;An update of the FARS analysis that led to the April 9, 1993 recall request letter;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;An analysis of the reasonableness of GM's decision to design the subject vehicle with side-mounted fuel-tanks, given what GM knew about the safety risks associated with that design and the availability of feasible alternative designs; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;An analysis of the information about the risk of post-crash fuel leaks that became available to GM during the time the subject vehicles were being manufactured.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

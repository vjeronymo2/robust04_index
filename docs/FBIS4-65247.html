			<p>BFN     [Text] At dawn today unidentified people set fire to a car  belonging to the YSEE [Greek General Confederation of Labor] in  Aryiroupolis. The car, which was parked at the junction of  Trapezounda and Olimbia Streets, was destroyed. The  Revolutionary Violence Cells [Pirines Epanastatkis Vias] claimed  responsibility for the car's arson in a telephone call to a  private radio station.    A YSEE statement described the arson as a provocative action  aimed at disorientating the working people. The statement  condemned the unseen elements, who, with their suspicious and  evil presence, have again tried to open a front against the  trade unions--and this on the day of the May Day observances.</p>

			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> SEA TURTLES' LAST REFUGE MAY BE LAND IN FLORIDA  </P> <P> The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service plans to create the country's first land  refuge for a sea creature.  </P> <P> It will give loggerhead sea turtles a safe place to nest and for their young to  hatch. The proposed refuge would include segments of a 20-mile beach at the  Brevard-Indian River county line on Florida's Atlantic Coast.  </P> <P> About 25% of the loggerhead turtles on the East Coast of the United States nest  on that one stretch of beach.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'One Last Opportunity'  </P> <P> "I think we've got one last opportunity to protect the second most important  nesting beach for loggerheads in the world," said Earl E. Possardt,  Southeastern sea turtle coordinator for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,  Jacksonville, Fla.  </P> <P> "There's some development down there now, but we can make a difference in the  long-term protection of that population. We've got one last chance."  </P> <P> The largest nesting population is in Oman on the Gulf of Hormuz, center of the  world's oil tanker traffic and target of attacks during the Iran-Iraq War, said  Marydele Donelly, director of the Washington-based Turtle Rescue Fund. Their  safety is not assured.  </P> <P> Loggerhead turtles at one time nested from the Florida Keys to North Carolina.  Those remaining account for 30% of the world population of loggerheads.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Steady Decline' in Turtles  </P> <P> "We're talking in the range of 10,000 to 12,000 turtles a year, and we've seen  a steady decline in the loggerhead population. In some areas it's a very  dramatic decline, as in South Carolina," she said.  </P> <P> "This is the last large concentration," she said, although there is a lot of  nesting farther south in Broward County, Ft. Lauderdale. "Who's to say what  kind of nesting they'd have if they didn't have a developed beach?"  </P> <P> </P> <P> Plans to Protect Beach  </P> <P> The state of Florida plans to create a park in the area, protecting 4 1/2 miles  of beach. Acquisition of the first acreage could begin this year.  </P> <P> The federal program has much further to go. The concept has been approved by  former FWS Director Frank Dunkle, but now the service must prepare an  environmental assessment and investigate alternatives, including land  purchases.  </P> <P> If land purchases are the alternative, the service will begin seeking money  from Congress to buy valuable, high-priced oceanfront property, with an  estimated price tag of $90 million.  </P> <P> Four segments of land totaling 9.3 miles of beach and about 500 acres of sand  have been identified for protection. The refuge would be only 100 to 200 yards  deep.  </P></p>

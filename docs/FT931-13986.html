			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / New world order: upstarts overtake IBM ----------------------------------------------------------------------- IBM  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Intertaional Business Machines, the creation of Thomas Watson snr., made its name in tabulating equipment. It was slow into computers but after the launch of System/360 in 1963, it quickly captured the world market for mainframes. It dominated data processing for 25 years through aggressive, resourceful marketing. A latecomer to personal computers, it eventually dominated that market. IBM planned to achieve dollars 100bn annual sales by the turn of the century but failed to appreciate the speed at which customers were moving from expensive mainframes which commanded high gross profit margins to networks of smaller, cheaper computers.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Microsoft  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Microsoft was a small personal computer software company in 1980 when IBM asked its youthful president Bill Gates to develop operating software for its soon-to-be-launched personal computer. Now some 120 pcs world-wide run on the company's MS-DOS. The success of the PC made Microsoft's fortune and ensured its significant position in the future of the computer industry. Microsoft supplies 30 per cent of the world pc market; Gates, still only 37, is America's richest man with about dollars 7bn. While not outstandingly innovative, the company is an aggressive marketer. It faces a US investigation into allegations of unfair and monopolistic practices.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Intel  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Intel, now the world's largest semiconductor manufacturer, benefited greatly from IBM's decision to use its family of microprocessors for the market-leading IBM PC. Pc manufacturers aiming to build machines compatible with IBM's were obliged to use Intel chips or copies made by other manufacturers. Under Andrew Groves, the semiconductor maker has fiercely protected its dominant position - some 70 per cent or more of pcs use Intel chips - by refusing to license its most sophisticated designs to its competitors. It improved sales and profits dramatically in 1992 and is expected to repeat the performance this year with its Pentium chip.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> TOWN GETS WATER THE DIVINE WAY  </P> <P> Town Councilman Charles (Bill) Hansen found water for the new town hall the  old-fashioned way.  </P> <P> He dowsed it.  </P> <P> Drillers from a local well company came up dry after drilling a 300-foot hole  for the combination town hall and highway garage on a 28-acre parcel, the  Schenectady Daily Gazette reported.  </P> <P> Finding water on the parcel will tell builders where to place the building.  </P> <P> Hansen took his forked oak rod and checked the lot himself, marking off a spot  for the well driller. Within 150 feet, the well company hit a 20-gallon-per  minute spring.  </P> <P> Divining rods, when held by the two prongs, supposedly twitch over the spot  where water runs underground.  </P></p>

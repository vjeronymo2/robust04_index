			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Business and the Law: Strings attached to contracting out - It is not clear whether employee rights legislation applies to UK public-sector policy If the UK government thought that by opting out of the social chapter of the Maastricht agreement it could wave goodbye to European interference with UK employment rights, it has had to think again. Its flagship policy on contracting out public sector services has been thrown into confusion by the impact of the European Acquired Rights Directive. The directive, which was translated into UK law by the 1981 Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations (TUPE), has a simple purpose: to protect the jobs and conditions of employees when the undertaking they work for changes hands. New employers must take over existing contracts of employment, consult with unions and honour collective agreements. In theory, the impact of the 1977 directive ought to be clear by now. In reality, it is not. After almost 15 years of virtually trouble-free operation, there is widespread uncertainty over its application. The problem is particularly acute in the UK, where doubts over whether TUPE extends to compulsory competitive tendering and market testing mean that the government's policy on these matters is said to be in danger of collapse. Given that the profitability of public sector contracts often depends on the contractor trimming employment costs by cutting jobs and reducing the pay of those transferred, it is hardly surprising that contractors have become wary of the contracting-out process. But why has TUPE suddenly become such a problem? Until recently, it had been assumed, in the UK at least, that the 1977 directive applied only where there was a merger, acquisition or takeover of a commercial venture. This interpretation, which would have ruled out the directive's application to the contracting out of services with a purely social or public purpose, was reflected in the 1981 regulations by excluding their application to 'any undertaking which is not in the nature of a commercial venture'. But in 1992, the European Court of Justice ruled in a case called Dr Sophie Redmond that the Acquired Rights Directive could apply to undertakings that were not purely commercial in nature. Recognising that TUPE was incompatible with European law, and faced with infraction proceedings by the European Commission, the UK government last August bowed to the inevitable - using the 1993 Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Act to remove the offending words from TUPE. But while the act leaves no room for doubt that TUPE can apply to the contracting out of services - something that had been recognised since the Sophie Redmond decision - the question of whether or not it applies in any particular case remains uncertain. The uncertainty has not been helped by a number of conflicting court decisions. The approach of the ECJ in Luxembourg is that the directive is capable of broad application. In the 1993 Rask case, which involved the contracting out of a staff canteen by Philips, the Dutch electronics company, the ECJ ruled that the Acquired Rights Directive could apply where an employer assigned to an outside contractor the responsibility of managing an in-house service. For the directive to apply, two conditions had to be met. The service had to form an identifiable part of the employer's operations, and it had to retain its identity after transfer. The ECJ's guidance was followed by the English Employment Appeal Tribunal last July in the case of Wren v Eastbourne Borough Council, which involved the contracting out of the council's refuse collection services. The appeal tribunal said a mere transfer of services could fall within the scope of the regulations but, to the disappointment of all who had hoped the case would settle the issue of whether TUPE applied to compulsory competitive tendering, it referred back to the industrial tribunal the question of whether the contracting out of refuse services amounted to a transfer of an undertaking. The European Court's broad approach was also followed by the English High Court last summer in Kenny v Woodroffe, where it said TUPE applied to the transfer of prison education services from a local authority to a local further education college. But in August, this trend towards a broad application of TUPE by the English courts was reversed by the Employment Appeal Tribunal in the Dines case, causing fresh confusion. The appeal tribunal upheld an industrial tribunal ruling that there was no transfer when the contract for cleaning Orsett Hospital in Essex came to an end and a new contract was awarded to a different contractor. The Dines case goes to the appeal court in June. To add to the uncertainty faced by contractors, the government's line on the application of TUPE to contracting out has been inconsistent. Two years ago the government advised contractors to bid for contracts on the basis that TUPE applied. Now the government says it is up to contractors to decide whether it applies or not. This is causing big problems for contractors, according to Mr Cliff Davis-Coleman of the CDC Research company specialising in local authority contracts. Mr Davis-Coleman, who founded the TUPE lobbying group, Clause 26 (named after a clause in the 1988 Local Government Act), says contractors are in an impossible situation. They are unsure whether to allow for the costs of TUPE when they tender, so perhaps submitting a bid far higher than their rivals; to bid on the basis TUPE does not apply, and risk being taken to court by employees if they win the contract; or to submit two bids. By September, contractors were so confused that a survey among Clause 26 members suggested that contracting out had virtually come to a standstill. Since then, however, the situation has improved. Ms Melanie Tether, a partner of City solicitors Norton Rose, believes that contractors and local authorities are beginning to come to terms with the fact that the initial contracting out of public services is a transfer for TUPE purposes. Guidance from the Department of Environment published last month has clarified the circumstances in which contractors and local authorities can seek indemnities from each other for unexpected TUPE costs. And a body of industrial tribunal decisions on the application of TUPE to the contracting out of different types of services is beginning to bring some certainty to first-round tenders between private contractors and local authorities. But problems remain. In particular, the question of whether TUPE protects pension rights and obliges contractors to provide 'comparable' pension provisions is causing concern, she says. The Court of Appeal will examine this issue in the summer in the Warrener case. Whether or not TUPE extends to pension rights may be irrelevant in the long term: the Attorney General, Sir Nicholas Lyell, has made clear that the government believes pension rights are protected by general employment law. If a new employer fails to provide comparable pension provision, employees may treat themselves as constructively dismissed and sue, he says. If the appeal court decides in Warrener that TUPE does not cover pensions, contractors may wish to challenge the attorney general's view, Ms Tether says, because it would be a substantial competitive advantage to contractors if they did not have to provide comparable pension provisions. There is also still much confusion over the application of TUPE to second-round tenders, where one contractor is taking over from another. The uncertainty in this area, epitomised by the Dines case, is also affecting the outsourcing of services in the private sector. According to Mr Ira Chalphin, employment research executive at the Institute of Directors, companies wanting to restructure and concentrate on their core businesses are concerned by the cost implications of TUPE. The IoD wants the UK government to put pressure on Brussels to limit the application of the Acquired Rights Directive to mergers and acquisitions. The directive is under review by the Commission at the moment. The IoD is also hoping the European Court of Justice will take the opportunity of the forthcoming Schmidt case, which involves the transfer of a cleaner employed by a German bank to a private contractor, to limit or reverse its view of the scope of the directive which it adopted in the Rask case. Lawyers, however, remain doubtful. According to Ms Tether, the European Court is unlikely to break new ground in the Schmidt case. People say this is an important test case because it involves only one person, she says. But the Rask case involved the transfer of only a handful of staff, and Schmidt essentially raises the same point. She also has doubts about the government's chances of persuading the other member states to limit the scope of the directive. 'Any change requires unanimity within the Council (of Ministers). I'd be very surprised if they get what they are looking for,' she says.</p>

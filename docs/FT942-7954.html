			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / UK Company News: CPL seeks listing later this month Expectations that it can continue to spread the sweet smell of success have spurred CPL, one of only two fragrance and flavour manufacturing companies in the UK, to seek a listing on the London Stock Exchange later this month. The company's origins go back to a firm of north country soap makers last century. Mr Terry Pickthall, chairman, explains that his family first became involved with the industry by inventing fragrances to disguise the smell of soap made from tallow. CPL, itself, was founded by Mr Pickthall and his late brother in 1971 as Contemporary Perfumers. It has grown into a multinational company with profits last year of Pounds 1.1m on turnover of Pounds 14.7m. The company is 57 per cent-owned by the family, who expect to retain around 40 per cent after the listing, and 34 per cent by Ensign Trust. It is aiming to raise around Pounds 5m net of expenses through a placing with institutions, and is expecting a market capitalisation of Pounds 20m. Mr Pickthall claims the company's products are found in goods used in most homes. The fragrances go into soaps, detergents, fabric conditioners, dishwashing liquids, air fresheners, shampoo and other personal care products, while flavourings are used in almost every manufactured food and drink. The company operates in two divisions - fragrance and flavouring, which accounts for 60 per cent of sales and aromatic ingredients. It employs 150 people worldwide, including a team of more than 20 perfumers who operate with over 5,000 ingredients. 'Clearly nature is bountiful in supply with a wonderful array of substances,' said Mr Pickthall. 'These are supplemented by aromatic chemicals, which were originally designed to replicate natural fragrances, but many of which are novel.' Credit Lyonnais is sponsor to the issue.</p>

			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTERN WORLD TILTS LEFT, LEAVING CONSERVATIVE CYCLE  </P> <P> It's time for Americans who have been monitoring Britain, Japan and West  Germany in the financial pages to start watching these countries' elections and  opinion polls. Modern Western politics is arguably in its first megacycle;  trends in London, Toronto and Tokyo -- places increasingly disenchanted with  conservatism -- may also signal the political future of the United States.  </P> <P> Surprising parallels have developed in recent years in the politics of the  Group of Seven industrial nations -- the United States, Britain, Japan, West  Germany, France, Canada and Italy. The result so far has been the West's first  international political cycle: an unprecedented conservative coloration on the  last 10 years of politics and policy-making in the world's principal economies.  But the next cycle -- possibly already visible in 1989 elections and surveys --  could easily move more to the center-left as a reaction to the conservative  excesses of the '80s.  </P> <P> The evidence is intriguing. The fashion of the late 1980s has been to emphasize  the growing international sway of market economics. Yet at the grass roots of  G-7 nations a different politics is catching hold. From Canada to Japan, from  Edinburgh, Scotland, to Edinburg, Texas, emerging economic and environmental  issues tilt mildly left instead of right.  </P> <P> The logic of yet another new political tide in the 1990s depends on what's  still too little understood about the 1980s -- its unique success as the great  conservative governmental and philosophic heyday of the late 20th Century.  Other conservative periods of the postwar era were brief. The late-1950s  convergence of Dwight D. Eisenhower, Charles de Gaulle in France, Konrad  Adenauer in West Germany and Harold MacMillan in Britain -- a World War II  memory lane -- was quickly overwhelmed by the youthful liberal thrust of the  early '60s.  </P> <P> The 1980s, by contrast, were an ideological cavalry charge. Conservative  governments held power in most G-7 countries. In contrast to the placid  Eisenhower era, conservatism has been aggressive enough to exert ideological  gravity even on nominally leftist regimes such as the French presidency of  Francois Mitterand and the current Labor Party governments of Australia and New  Zealand.  </P> <P> Cooperation between the conservative political parties and governments  dominating the G-7 has been unprecedented. In some cases, cross-fertilization  of strategies and policies extended to assistance at election time. President  George Bush's May visit to German Chancellor Helmut Kohl was the most recent  example, but Ronald Reagan helped British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in  the 1982 Falklands crisis and did everything but campaign for the Canadian  conservatives just before the 1988 election. The Japanese government provided  important 1988 election-year help to the Bush campaign by supporting the  dollar. Chicago economist David Hale even suggested, tongue in cheek, that the  Bank of Japan should have had to register as a GOP political-action committee.  Indeed, between 1985 and 1989, cooperative management of the world economy was  what the G-7 became known for.  </P> <P> Without the participants' common conservative politics, it probably wouldn't  have worked. But leaders of G-7 countries shared similar national  constituencies in business and finance, as well as commitments to tax reduction  and deregulation. The wide success of this agenda, coupled with the longevity  and sweep of conservative political control in most of the G-7, supports the  thesis of the modern West's first political megacycle.  </P> <P> But the fuller test of developing transnational political patterns may be  whether the G-7 can dance a two-step -- first one way, then another. For the  moment, at least, the evidence drifting in from 1989 elections and opinion  surveys does suggest a countertrend: G-7 countries, having moved to the right  together during the 1980s, are now moving together back to the center -- and  possibly beyond.  </P> <P> This reaction is most vivid in the nations with the world's leading stock  markets -- the United States, Canada, Britain and Japan -- where rousing  economic successes of the 1980s have concentrated benefits among a fifth or a  tenth of the population and left others grumbling about declining "quality of  life" measurements and rising tax burdens. While top income tax brackets have  been reduced, regressive taxes have been imposed on the general public -- new  national consumer taxes in Japan and Canada, Britain's resented "poll tax" (a  new head tax to replace local property taxes) and rising U.S. Social Security  taxes.  </P> <P> This is the dark side of conservative politics, and signs of a voter revolt  have been multiplying. France swung back to the Socialists in 1988, who  promptly reimposed a controversial wealth tax. Meanwhile, in spring, 1989,  flashing electoral red lights appeared for Thatcher and her Conservative Party,  largely as a result of public anger over such measures as the poll tax and  proposed privatization of water and electricity, coupled with reforms that  voters believed might cripple the popular National Health Service. In June, an  increasingly revitalized Labor Party beat the Conservatives in Britain's  European Parliament elections by a stunning 40.1% to 34.7%. Since then, summer  polls have shown Labor leading the Tories by up to 15 points. Large majorities  say the Conservatives favor the rich, and there's growing belief that Labor may  just have a chance to win the next general election -- expected in 1991.  </P> <P> By late 1988, polls in Japan were also charting a potential revolution -- an  increasing belief that middle-class society was coming unglued. In one  government-sponsored poll, 74% called the system unfair while more than half  complained of a widening income gap between ordinary people and those making  huge profits in soaring stock and real estate markets. When the  conservative-run Liberal Democratic Party government cut income tax brackets  and imposed a 3% consumption tax, voters began rebelling.  </P> <P> Scandals also diminished LDP popularity. In late July, just before the Japan  Socialist Party won its stunning victory in elections for half the nation's  upper legislative house, the weekly Economist described the Socialist policy as  "pledged to scrap the 3% consumption tax, raising the cash instead by soaking  the rich, probably through taxes on capital gains." Full legislative elections  are expected this year, and LDP control of the government is likely to give way  to a coalition.  </P> <P> North of the border in Canada, Conservative Prime Minister Brian Mulroney is in  trouble over plans to bolster revenue with a new 9% value-added tax. Polls show  70% voter disapproval. Some Conservative members of Parliament threaten  opposition, and the latest Canadian Gallup polls, released in mid-August, show  the Liberal Party opening up a big 43%-to-27% lead over the Conservatives, with  the left-tilting New Democratic Party pulling 27%. No new elections are  required until 1993, however.  </P> <P> West Germany's governing Christian Democrats are also shaky, and if these  various national trends don't reverse, some observers project that only two or  three of the G-7 governments will still be in conservative hands by 1992. Of  course, even many Americans who acknowledge the political shifts elsewhere  doubt they have relevance for this country -- the other big question.  Stipulating that the United States was the principal engine of the global  conservative trend of the 1980s, can the process work in reverse? Can  countertrends visible in Europe and Japan jump the oceans to Long Island and  the San Fernando Valley?  </P> <P> Maybe. Bush's Administration is far more popular than the other conservative  governments in the G-7, while the Democrats have so far been a less aggressive  and articulate counterforce than some of the other opposition parties. However,  even in the United States, Bush Administration high ratings come largely from  success in international affairs, with the President drawing much lower ratings  for handling the economy or domestic policy. Democratic House Speaker Thomas S.  Foley has just begun expressing concern about "the alienation and separation of  economic classes in this country." As a new Democratic theme this would follow  the emerging G-7 model for successful opposition parties in a world of  increasing political interdependence.  </P></p>

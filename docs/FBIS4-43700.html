			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Left Democrats To Elect New Leader </F> at End of Month"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 15 -- The national council of the  Democratic Party of the Left will meet June 30 and July 1 to  elect a new party leader to replace Achille Occhetto, who  resigned Monday [13 June], council chairman Giglia Tedesco  announced Wednesday.    The council meeting will be preceded by nationwide  consultations with about 200 local party leaders, regional  secretaries, mayors, union leaders and other party officials,  announced Umberto Ranieri, one of eight members of a special  commission formed yesterday to collect candidatures for the post.    Consultations should be completed by next Tuesday and "will  be open," Tedesco said, "meaning that they are not aimed at  verifying consensus on pre-existing candidatures, they are not a  primary election in any way."    For his part, Ranieri said that, "today's top political  problem is to prevent moderate voters from turning to the right  and to stop Forza Italia from taking over the center," referring  to the strong gains made by Premier Silvio Berlusconi's party in  Sunday's European Parliament elections.    The other main issue, he said, is to find quickly a leader  who has the support and trust of other members of the  Progressive Alliance, a coalition led by the Left Democrats.    Separately, the man widely touted as the most likely  candidate to replace Occhetto, Massimo D'Alema, said he had  "many doubts" about the decision to name a new secretary  immediately, rather than find a temporary solution until the  party's national congress assembly can meet at the end of the  year.    "We could have decided to name a collective body, a  `directorate' of sorts until the congress is held," D'Alema told  reporters.    Other party officials have suggested moving up the national  congress to an earlier date.</p>

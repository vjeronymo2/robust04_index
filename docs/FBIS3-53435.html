Indian interest in Stinger was primarily to use the American  technology for upgrading their Akash series of missiles which  have not produced satisfactory results during the trials, they  said. Indians have been desperately trying to enhance the  capability of Akash to use it as an anti-missile-missile capable  of engaging multiple targets.    In this context India had also approached Israel for  transfer  of technology of Arrow anti-missile-missile which is a joint  venture of USA and Israel.    Informed sources have confirmed that access to Stinger  technology would significantly help India in improving the  performance of Akash missiles. It may also be recalled that the  Clinton administration had allocated huge sums for purchasing  the Stingers from the Mojahedin to obviate the possibility of  these being delivered to a third country.    It may be mentioned here that the Indian intelligence  agencies operating in Afghanistan and having links with Afghan  counterparts Khad/WAD were making hectic efforts to establish  rapport with various Mujahideen groups for this purpose since  quite some time.</p>

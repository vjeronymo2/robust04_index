			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / The Long View: A hedger's honeymoon 'I figured there would never be another bonus like it,' said Steve the strategist, 'so I banked it and moved on.' I could tell that Steve's circumstances had changed: his normal fat and bulging briefcase had gone, and all through lunch he failed to produce a single document or complain about his global seminar schedule. 'You know I hate to follow the crowd,' he said eventually, 'but I'm afraid this time I've jumped on a bandwagon. I've joined a new hedge fund. You know the sort of thing, British Virgin Islands registration, pseudo-Latin name, half the investors from Colombia, Dollars 250,000 minimum, no questions asked. We take 20 per cent of the upside, they take 100 per cent of the downside.' Hedge funds did not appear to be getting a very good press, I remarked. Did it not worry the investors that regulators might start to crack down? 'No chance, it's great free publicity' said Steve. 'Every story about a congressional committee grilling George Soros or the Bundesbank warning about chaos produced by hedge funds only whets the appetites of our punters. Remember, even if they're not cocaine runners most of them take pride in never paying a penny in tax. The idea of making billions out of central banks, like Bank Negara of Malaysia has just admitted losing over Dollars 5 1/2 bn on currencies in two years, is irresistible.' In fact, I said, the controversy must have usefully diverted attention from the awkward fact that many of the hedge funds lost 15 or 20 per cent of their assets in the global bond market crash in February and March. It seemed odd that so many new hedge funds should now be finding support. Last year's boom was bound to attract new entrants, explained Steve. The successful, established hedge funds were all closed, in fact some were returning capital so as to stay a manageable size. Therefore new investors had to go into start-up funds without track records. Likewise the banks, desperate to find lending opportunities, had to agree to leverage up newcomers or see their business shrink. It sounded, I said, like a formula for disaster. According to the efficient markets hypothesis hedge funds should not succeed anyway. Even if you accepted that there were a few geniuses around, who could flout the odds, you could hardly believe that dozens more could suddenly start up and keep winning. In fact, some intermediaries were now monitoring 800 hedge funds. 'Forget efficient markets,' said Steve. 'The concept was invented by college professors and exploited by bank trust departments to sell no-brainer index funds because they couldn't beat the S &amp; P 500. Anyway, nobody ever denied that inefficiencies exist. Remember that the original hedge fund label was devised because such funds could go short as well as long. Why be one of 99 investors looking for cheap stocks when you could be all on your own hunting expensive ones? Why be forced to show negative returns in a bear market? Nowadays, of course, hedge funds are really leveraged funds, multiplying the risk, but able to cut it quickly in all significant markets because of the growth of liquid markets in derivatives.' The big way of winning, Steve said, was to latch on to an enduring trend, such as the bull markets in European bonds or Hong Kong stocks last year. You would always be top-sliced at the turn, as the hedge funds had been this winter, but you would only lose a fraction of the earlier gains. But where markets were only ranging rather than trending it was much harder to make money. 'Right now,' said Steve, 'we see the big opportunities as being in the exploitation of political risk. Remember that the mainstream investor universe out there is risk-averse, it doesn't want to have to explain to its boards of trustees why it is exposed to South Africa or Mexico when there are massacres in the streets and assassinations. Therefore risk, so long as you diversify it and control it, is fundamentally over-rewarded. 'I should know, I'm talking about my old client base, which operated according to benchmarks which depended on relative market size. The more expensive that Tokyo equities became in the 1980s the more you were supposed to hold. Worse, the benchmark could be redrawn without warning. In 1992 Salomon Brothers suddenly put Italian bonds into its World Government Bond Index and the sheep had to buy lire exposure. Imagine the relief now of having no benchmark. We're running a race against one-legged rivals.' It couldn't be quite as easy as that, I suggested. There was certainly plenty of political turmoil around the world: Italy had just spectacularly overthrown the old order, other European leaders like Helmut Kohl and John Major were threatened, and even Bill Clinton was under a cloud. But the political crisis in Japan had actually led to a strengthening of the yen against the dollar, a move that had stung several of the hedge funds badly. This week, despite the exit of Hosokawa, the Nikkei Dow had moved above 20,000. If John Major were forced to resign in the UK would he be a buyer or seller? 'Both,' said Steve, 'but at different times. We are contrarians, we buy uncertainty and sell confidence. Regular elections are another question. But in the classic unscheduled resignation play we are in and out twice. We buy into the initial political crisis, then sell into the rally that follows the resignation. When the new leader takes power there's a sell-off, allowing us to buy and hold for the political honeymoon. Then a few months later we'll be out again - Balladur is still a good short, for example - and off to the next crisis somewhere else, there's no shortage.' I left Steve plotting a tour of the world's trouble spots. I wish him well, but his spiel was always so much better than his forecasts. And I will miss his slide shows.</p>

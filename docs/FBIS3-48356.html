			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, January 22 (KCNA) -- An advisor to the  Japanese Defence Agency, Sakuma, in a recent lecture reportedly  let loose a bellicose blast, saying that "Japan cannot sit idle  in an event of contingency" on the Korean peninsula and "mode of  Japan's cooperation with the U.S. Forces must be examined."    These grave utterances of Sakuma getting on the nerve of the  DPRK are an unpardonable, undisguised challenge to it. He fully  revealed the criminal scheme of the Japanese reactionaries to  stage a comeback to Korea.    Maximizing the fiction of "nuclear issue" and "missile  threat" of the DPRK, the Japanese rightwing reactionaries have  of late let out a string of bellicose outbursts, threatening a  "preemptive attack" and "Japan's participation in a war on the  Korean peninsula", having designated the DPRK as "imaginary  enemy No.1".    What is grave in this reinvasion scheme of the Japanese  reactionaries is that they intend to make Japan a shock force  with the backing of the United States in "an event of  contingency" on the Korean peninsula. This is evidenced by  Sakuma's words about "cooperation with the U.S. Forces" and  "Japan's support to the U.S. Forces."    When a prospect has been opened for a fundamental solution  of  the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula through DPRK-U.S.  contact, Japan is threatening an attack on the DPRK with the  backing of its dialogue partner. Can there be such folly in  other parts of the world?    The Japanese reactionaries are making a mistake.    They must not act rashly, deeply mindful of the terrible  consequences to be entailed by their rash act.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- A Japanese Government  advisory panel on Tuesday [31 May] blasted the "unilateral" or  "result- oriented" trade approach of the United States as only  adding "an extra layer of confusion and difficulty" to global  economic issues.    A subcommittee of the Industrial Structure Council, an  advisory organ to the trade minister, made the criticism in the  1994 report that identified and analyzed unfair trade policies  and measures of Japan's 10 major trading partners.    The report, the third of its kind, was compiled at a time  when Japan-U.S. economic relations have yet to be fully mended  under the long-running bickering over the definition of  "objective criteria," a set of tools designed to gauge the  openness of Japan's markets under the so-called framework trade  talks.    The council said analytical standards used in this year's  report are in line with internationally accepted World Trade  Organization (WTO) rules, which will expand the scope of  coverage to include services and intellectual property rights  from only trade in goods as under the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade (GATT).    The report said Japan's trade rules are basically in  conformity with the WTO agreement while those of the U.S.  deviate from it in that the country pursues "result-based  criteria."    "To a large extent, a preoccupation with trade results comes  from a tendency to see a direct link between current account or  trade imbalances and inadequate market access," the report said.    The report branded the result-oriented U.S. trade approach  as  managed trade, explaining that the country resorts to "numerical  targets" in order to achieve satisfactory results in market  shares or import values for specific American goods.    "We have grave apprehensions about the detrimental impact  that such policies would have on the free trade system," the  report said.    In a country-by-country survey, the report found problems  with U.S. trade policy in 10 of the 12 trade sectors covered.    "It would appear at first glance that the U.S. has made  little effort to improve its unfair trade policies and  measures," the report said.    The report showed concern about the recent revival of a  retaliatory trade clause known as Super 301. "Thinking behind  unilateral measures like Super 301 is the idea of the same  country serving both as prosecutor and judge," the report said.    U.S. antidumping measures against imports from Japan were  described by the report as creating "serious problems."    Of the 43 antidumping duties imposed by the U.S. on Japanese  products since 1980, 36 duty orders were still in force as of  March this year because of the lack of a "sunset" clause, the  report noted.    Regarding areas where unfair practices were dropped in  Japan's trade with the U.S., the report cited elimination of  requests for voluntary export restraints on machine tools and  automobiles.    In trade with the European Union (EU), the report pointed  out  problems in four of the 12 areas, including abuse of antidumping  measures, arbitrary approach in enforcing rules of origin and  unfair tariff classification of mecadecks -- a vital component  of videocassette recorders.    On the other hand, the report appreciated the EU's abolition  of discriminatory quantitative restrictions on Japanese exports  in March of this year.    The report found five problem areas in Japan's trade with  South Korea. Among them are rules of origin policy, standard  and certificate systems and an import source diversification  system intended to restrict imports from Japan.    Other countries and an area covered by this report are  Australia, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Canada and  Hong Kong.    This year's report reviewed for the first time the  countries'  agricultural policies and measures, an area newly agreed on  under the recently concluded GATT Uruguay Round of multilateral  trade talks.    During the negotiating process of the Uruguay Round, trade  positions were very large from countries to countries on farm  issues like rice.    The report stressed the need for countries to actively use a  new dispute settlement mechanism under the WTO, a multilateral  trade body that is expected to replace GATT next January.    WTO rules will have more enforcing power with a judicial  mechanism that will no longer allow countries to block the WTO  panel's findings against them under the so-called "negative  consensus" system.    "Making use of the strengthened dispute settlement  procedures  is a basic obligation of those who support the multilateral  trading system. Japan should be an active user of these  procedures when necessary," the report said.    The report assessed several issues involved in accession to  GATT by China and Taiwan.    Japan basically supports early GATT membership by China and  Taiwan, both among Japan's 10 largest trading partners.    The report noted, "however, we recognize it is important  that  both must first bring into conformity their trade policies and  measures with the WTO agreement."    High tariffs and quantitative import restrictions are among  problems to be overcome before their entry to GATT, the report  said.</p>

			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / BT profits fall Pounds 1bn on cost of job cuts BRITISH Telecommunication's heavy redundancy costs caused a Pounds 1.1bn fall in its pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.98bn for the year ended March and contributed to a worse-than-expected deficit in its pension fund. Changes in advanced corporation tax in the March Budget and dividend income lower than forecast were additional factors in the Pounds 750m pension fund deficit, foreshadowing similar pressure on other companies' pension funds. BT topped up its fund and resumed corporate contributions at the beginning of this financial year but the impact on profits is likely to be moderate, analysts said. The salary of Mr Iain Vallance, BT's chairman, is to be frozen at Pounds 465,000 and will not be reviewed again until July 1994. The performance-related component remains unchanged at Pounds 90,000. Despite the recession, turnover was only slightly lower at Pounds 13.24bn. Underlying turnover growth of 2.8 per cent in the final quarter led BT to claim it had 'turned the corner quite significantly'. An 8.3 per cent increase in net dividend payments and the strong cashflow of the business pleased the City. Analysts were untroubled by the unexpected size of the pension fund deficit. BT's shares closed 1.5p up, at 404p, encouraging news for the government as it prepares to sell a third tranche of its BT shares in July. The pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.98bn were after Pounds 1.03bn in charges for the voluntary redundancy scheme which reduced BT's workforce by 19 per cent over the year to 171,000. Disposals and the repurchase of bonds reduced profits by a further Pounds 190m. BT proposed a final dividend of 9.45p to make a total of 15.6p a share, up 8.3 per cent up on the previous year. Earnings per share fell to 19.8p from 33.2p. Lex, Page 18 BT pension scheme, Page 19 Cloud with silver lining, Page 21</p>

			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Optimism on German growth THE Bundesbank and the Economics Ministry yesterday issued cautiously optimistic forecasts for growth in the second half of the year, in spite of the uncertain outlook for exports in the world market. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, president of the Bundesbank, forecast overall growth of gross national product, for the united Germany, of between 2.0 and 2.5 per cent - up from earlier forecasts of just 2.0 per cent growth. 'I do not see any sign of slipping back into recession,' he said in a speech to the German-Greek chamber of commerce in Athens. But he expressed continuing concern over the rate of inflation, still 'well over 4 per cent', and insisted that the time had not come for 'an all-clear signal on the monetary policy front'. In Bonn, Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the economics minister, also predicted a 'gradual improvement' in growth prospects for the west German economy in the rest of the year. 'The German economy is proving itself robust, in spite of the unstable international environment,' Mr Mollemann said in a commentary on the monthly report of his ministry. Growth of GNP in western Germany in the first quarter reached a real 3.1 per cent compared with the same quarter of 1991, while gross domestic product - excluding the earnings of workers commuting from eastern Germany - was up by just 1.8 per cent. The increasingly confused debate in Germany over the future of the European Fighter Aircraft was thrown into fresh turbulence yesterday when it was agreed to postpone a decision by one week. The move was reported to have been made at the request of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, under pressure from his fellow-leaders in Britain, Italy and Spain to keep a German foothold in the project.</p>

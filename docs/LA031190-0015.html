			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> HIGH STYLE;  </P> <P> THE NEXT TANGO  </P> <P> 'EVERYTHING I DESIGN is for what it does, not for its looks," says Stephan  Copeland, a 30-year-old Montreal-born industrial designer who moved to L.A. so  he could windsurf at Venice Beach. Unlike the typical desk lamp comprising  rigid pieces pivoting on a few hinge points, Copeland's Tango lamp has flexible  steel cables that move in fluid, "organic" fashion.  </P> <P> The design for the Tango was good enough to land Copeland a contract with Flos,  the high-style Italian lamp manufacturer (he is the first non-Italian to do  so). Tango also won the prestigious 1989 Institute of Business Designers Bronze  Award in the portable-lamp category.  </P> <P> List prices for the Tango run: $450 for the table base with halogen bulb, $370  with fluorescent; $320 for the fluorescent clamp model.  </P> <P>  Available in mid-March at Atelier International Limited, Pacific Design  Center, 8687 Melrose Ave., Los Angeles, (213) 659-9402.  </P> <P> DAVID LASKER  </P></p>

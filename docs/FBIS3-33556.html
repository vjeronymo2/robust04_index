			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 24 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- President Carlos  Salinas de Gortari has voiced optimism over the rapid progress  being made in the dialogue to seek a "dignified and just peace"  in southeastern Chiapas State, and he has reaffirmed his  commitment to furthering democracy in Mexico.    Salinas de Gortari said: "This is a dignified and just  peace,  and this is exactly what we have been striving for. Without a  doubt, I am encouraged by the results announced yesterday and  the progress being made."    Today in the Chiapas town of San Cristobal de las Casas,  Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and reconciliation,  and the armed group began their fourth day of talks amid  substantial progress in an effort to find a political solution  to the conflict that began on 1 January.    Interviewed at the conclusion of a "Flag Day" ceremony in  Mexico City, Salinas de Gortari commended the peace  commissioner's work by saying, "he is working with utmost  dedication, complete loyalty and commitment, and with great  patriotism." Camacho Solis "is earnestly performing the task I  entrusted upon him (on 10 January), and the fact that the  dialogue is advancing so rapidly is certainly pleasing," the  president noted.    In confirming the announcement Camacho Solis made yesterday,  Salinas de Gortari indicated the peace commissioner "has been in  permanent contact with me, and I have authorized him to proceed  with the proposals he has made." The president said the peace  commissioner has been instructed that "in terms of the Indians'  social demands," he should be "generous with his responses."    Yesterday, the Zapatist National Liberation Army said it had  received a "satisfactory response" to one-fourth of its demands  regarding health, education, housing, communications, and  respect for Indian traditions and rights.    Also during the impromptu interview, President Salinas de  Gortari commented on the recent talks between the Government  Secretariat and the nation's political parties concerning the 21  August federal elections.    "I am convinced we need to take additional steps in  advancing  the country's democratic life," the president stated, while  emphasizing his commitment to promote the advancement of  democracy in Mexico. He added, "As a citizen, I may have --  certainly, as each one of you have -- an (electoral) preference,  but as president of the Republic I am committed to an impartial  and democratic election."    Earlier, during the "Flag Day" ceremony headed by Salinas de  Gortari at the midtown Constitution Plaza, the Armed Forces  reiterated their support for the pacification process in Chiapas  -- a process the president began on 10 January.    "We are not indifferent to the efforts you and your  government have made and are still making to resolve the  problems we face, some of which date back a long time, others of  which are new," General Alvaro Vallarta Cecena stated. The  commander of the 16th Military Zone continued, "These problems  are complex and difficult to resolve because of the balance that  must be maintained in an effort to avoid isolating people in a  world that is becoming more interdependent and more demanding."    The military chief added, "The defense of the fatherland in  this new world requires a flair and unity that will withstand  all tests, combining in a balanced manner family with society,  nationalism with internationalism."</p>

			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / US officials 'destroyed Iraq papers': Congressman claims loan guarantee documents shredded OFFICIALS of the Bush administration were accused yesterday of having spent the past weekend shredding documents pertaining to US government loan guarantees for Iraq. Mr Henry Gonzalez, chairman of the House banking committee, who has been investigating US aid to Iraq, said in a press conference yesterday he was informed of the alleged shredding in a telephone call from 'a senior career employee' at the Department of Agriculture. Mr Gonzalez and other senior members of Congress yesterday also accused President George Bush of helping to arm Iraq before its August 1990 invasion of Kuwait and then trying to cover up US government involvement. In a letter to Mr Edward Madigan, secretary of agriculture, Mr Gonzalez said he was told the alleged shredding encompassed all memos and records of telephone calls that would link government officials to decisions made about the extension of loans to Iraq that were backed by guarantees from the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), the export guarantee arm of the Agriculture Department. Mr Gonzalez urged Mr Madigan to investigate the allegations. The Texan Democrat, who has been spearheading congressional investigations of the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) scandal, said he was also concerned that some of the CCC documents supposedly shredded might have related to BNL. Nearly Dollars 1bn of the more than Dollars 5bn of unauthorised Iraqi loans made by BNL's Atlanta branch were backed by US government guarantees provided by the CCC. Mr Gonzalez's claim was supported by aides to Senator Patrick Leahy, who chairs the Senate agriculture committee. The aides said they had received calls about the alleged shredding last Friday and one Senate staffer who went to the Agriculture Department found all of the shredding machines being brought to one room. Senator Leahy wrote to the Agriculture Department yesterday asking that all Iraq-related documents be secured. The senator said yesterday the CCC loan guarantees for Iraq helped President Saddam Hussein to acquire nuclear technology and weapons of mass destruction rather than food. Mr Gonzalez charged yesterday it was 'quite clear that from day one it has been the policy of the highest levels of the Bush administration to mislead the Congress and, more importantly, the public into thinking that our government played no role in arming Iraq.'</p>

			<p><P> March 18, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> BERGESON CALLS FOR 'COALITION FOR CHANGE'  </P> <P> State Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), who this month introduced  statewide legislation aimed at managing problems associated with growth,  appealed to county officials Friday to "forge a coalition for change."  </P> <P> In a meeting with the Southern California Assn. of County Supervisors in  Newport Beach, Bergeson discussed her growth legislation package and called for  cooperation between cities and counties to manage growth in the state.  </P> <P> "The whole thrust of what we're trying to get at is to get people to talk and  work together," Bergeson said. She added that she is not trying to take power  away from local governments but rather to develop a broad statewide policy to  help local and regional governments act more effectively. "The problems are  just too big for any one community to solve alone," she said.  </P> <P> She cited environmental impact reports, which are required for all new  development in the state, as an example of a state policy created to address  the problems of growth.  </P> <P> Bergeson's legislation includes a provision that would encourage cities to work  together on traffic, housing and other growth-related matters. Another, she  said, would allow cities to share tax revenue on certain new developments, and  another would offer priority for state bonds and grants as an incentive for  cities to accept new developments.  </P> <P> Critics of Bergeson's legislation have said that it does not address the  problem of a lack of revenue for the infrastructure that must accompany growth.  Bergeson said she agrees that the state's revenue shortage is a problem but  that her proposals are "a first step" toward improving the problems growth is  posing.  </P> <P> To ensure that necessary tax legislation could be passed, she called Friday for  a "massive public information campaign" to tell people how their money would be  used. She also mentioned that bond sales are an alternative.  </P></p>

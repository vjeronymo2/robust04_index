			<p><P> January 10, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HIDDEN HILLS POLLED ON LOWER-COST HOUSING  </P> <P> The city of Hidden Hills began polling residents Tuesday on a plan to build  lower-cost housing for senior citizens outside the town's gated network of  private roads.  </P> <P> The Hidden Hills City Council's plan to build 46 units of lower-cost housing  has generated opposition from some residents, who persuaded the council last  year to conduct the non-binding advisory poll.  </P> <P> The poll will continue through today and Thursday, with results expected  Friday, Mayor Chris K. Van Peski said.  </P> <P> Van Peski expressed confidence that residents will back the council, which has  supported the lower-cost housing plan as a relatively painless way to comply  with requirements of state law.  </P> <P> The 46-unit project would allow Hidden Hills to settle a lawsuit over its use  of a redevelopment agency to help finance a needed drain project that was  expected to cost more than $5 million. State law requires that 20% of  redevelopment revenues be spent on affordable housing.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, it has been determined that this rule is a ``significant regulatory action'' because the rule seems to raise novel legal or policy issues. As such, this action was submitted to OMB for review. Any changes made in response to OMB suggestions or recommendations are documented in the public record. Any written comments from OMB to EPA and any written EPA response to those comments are included in the docket. The docket is available for public inspection at the EPA's Air Docket Section, which is listed in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  section of this preamble.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The information collection requirements in this rule have been approved by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  et seq., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and have been assigned control number 2060&hyph;0258.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This collection of information has an estimated burden averaging from 8 to 16 hours per response for about 124 responses. These estimates include time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An Information Collection Request document and estimates of the public reporting burden were prepared in connection with the January 11, 1993 regulations. 56 FR 63098; 58 FR 3650. The regulation modifications contained in today's proposal will not significantly change the reporting burden that was previously estimated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Send comments regarding this burden analysis or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to Chief, Information Policy Branch, EPA, 401 M Street, S.W. (Mail Code 2136), Washington, DC 20460; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , requires each federal agency to consider potential impacts of its regulations on small business ``entities.'' Under 5 U.S.C. 604(a), an agency issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking must prepare and make available for public comment a regulatory flexibility analysis. Such an analysis is not required if the head of an agency certifies that a rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the preamble of the January 11, 1993 regulations, the Administrator certified that those regulations, including the provisions revised by today's final rule, would not have a significant impact. 58 FR 3649. The final rule revisions adopted today are not significant enough to change the economic impact addressed in the preamble of the January 11, 1993 regulations, which were certified as not having a significant impact. The revisions will prevent the creation of about 200,000 excess, new allowances and thus will have an annual impact of about $318,000 per year in Phase I, i.e., 200,000 allowances times $159 (the weighted average winning bid for 1995 allowances in the EPA 1994 Allowance Auction on March 28, 1994.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  59 FR 19712, 19714 (Apr. 25, 1994)). Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that the revised rule will not have a significant, adverse impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Miscellaneous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with section 117 of the Act, publication of this rule was preceded by consultation with any appropriate advisory committees, independent experts, and federal departments and agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 72  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental protection, Acid rain, Air pollution control, Electric utilities, Permits, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Sulfur dioxide. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: November 14, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Carol M.

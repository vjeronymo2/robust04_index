			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Natalya Gorodetskaya, reporting from Groznyy: </F> "Chechnya Decides To Establish World Islamic Center: Peoples of  the Northern Caucasus Urged To Unite Against Russian Genocide"]    [Text] The report that Groznyy was to be the site of an  international seminar entitled "Genocide in the USSR: Ideology,  Policy and Practice" put nationalistically inclined segments of  the public into ecstasy -- no events on this scale have been  held in Chechnya since the "Revolution of 1991." According to  eyewitnesses, when the director of one of the best health  resorts in the republic told his staff that the seminar  participants would be staying there, many of the staff cried for  joy. The patients, upon hearing the news, "themselves packed  their belongings and went home, saying that they would finish  their treatment later, and many of them were crying for joy and  praying" (only the most seriously ill stayed). The guests, who  despite the fears of the organizing committee came not only from  the Northern Caucasus republics but also from the United States,  Syria, Kazakhstan, the Crimea, Moscow and Lithuania, were  received with hospitality that exceeded the wildest  expectations. On the first evening the road-weary visitors were  placed in mud baths, sulfur baths and other therapeutic baths,  anyone who wanted got a special water massage, and then all were  given showered with food and drink. Furthermore, as later became  known, it was not just female attendants and nurses who  smilingly carried away dirty plates and glasses and attended to  the guests' every whim, but also an anesthesiologist, surgeons  and even the head of the surgical department. The visitors were  somewhat confused to see the pistols hanging from the belts of  the health resort's director and several conference  participants, something that was particularly noticeable when  they were dancing the lezginka with their jackets  off, as well as automatic weapons in the hands of numerous young  people, both in uniform and in civilian clothing. However, local  residents assured them that "this was the custom" and that the  young people were presidential guards assigned to protect the  guests. It should be noted that the only shooting on the streets  was at weddings, in honor of the brides, something that has been  done in Chechnya since time immemorial. The streets themselves  were cleaner than in Moscow, and new paving machines purchased  in the FRG (for $6,000,000) have already begun repairing road  surfaces.    The conference was opened by Dzhokhar Dudayev, president of  the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, who immediately set the mood  among those attending. Since, he said, previous crimes against  humanity have gone unpunished, genocide is now on the rise. The  U.N., said the president, "on which the citizens of the USSR  pinned their hopes, has usurped the right to human life." In his  opinion, in Russia there are no democrats, the West's human  rights activism is a mere "fig leaf," and as a result genocide  is becoming ever more refined and overt: "Russia's troops and  armored units are cavorting across the entire USSR, showing off  their might," said Mr. Dudayev.    Incidentally, the zealousness of many speakers at the  conference is not without justification -- in the period between  1792 and 1943-44 the Chechen people were removed from their  homeland six times. Eyewitnesses to the deportation of the  Chechens during the Great Patriotic War tell how NKVD troops  shot down or burned alive the disabled, the sick and children,  hunted down in the mountains those who managed to escape, mined  their homes, and left poisoned food scattered about in the  forests. The story of the life and death of many Chechen people  in exile is a story worthy of respect. Also known to us are the  suffering of the Shapsug people, who for many years have been  attempting to establish an ethnic territory near Sochi, of the  Crimean Tatars, who have returned home and have had to spend  four years living outside Simferopol in tents and houses hastily  pieced together out of any materials available, and of the  Ingush, who dream of returning to their homes in North Ossetia's  Prigorodnyy Rayon.    However, despite the fact that virtually every speaker  declared that he did not in any way blame the Russian people as  a whole, and that "those to blame for the genocide were the  rulers of the time," a general anti-Russia sentiment could  clearly be felt. Russia was accused of "considering the Chechen  an inferior people incapable of governing a state," and of  intentionally preventing the Chechen people from obtaining  education. A former republic procurator read an entire treatise  on persecution suffered by the Chechens in the Russian  Federation in 1993-94, about how they were beaten and convicted,  how people's assemblies forced them to move. Incidentally, these  new facts were not accompanied by any information as to why the  Chechen are still being subjected to persecutions that are not  always unfounded (unless one counts the decree by Yuriy Luzhkov,  which has been condemned by the world community). However, one  should not think that now Russians are being subjected to  physical violence by of the Chechens: Dzhokhar Dudayev warned  that "any violence against the Russian-speaking population will  be regarded on a par with the most serious crime" and, as one  Russian resident of Groznyy said, "it is much safer for Russians  to live here than it is for the Chechens."    Speakers addressing the conference accused Russia of  great-power chauvinism, demanded that it give a legal, political  and moral assessment of "cases of genocide," and that it make  compensation for damages suffered by Chechnya during the last  deportation (according to estimates by Chechen experts, a total  of R522 billion [rubles]). In the opinion of a majority of those  attending the conference, all "of Russia's crimes against  humanity from the 17th century up to the present day" should be  considered and condemned by the International Court and  Tribunal. Russian recognition of Chechnya's sovereignty,  speakers stated, is "the only real guarantee there will be no  more deportations."    For fairness' sake it should be noted that not everyone in  the ChRI [Chechen Republic of Ichkeria] defends its sovereignty  so resolutely. Many people I spoke with would prefer for the  republic to remain a part of Russia, though on certain  conditions. Ruslan Khasbulatov, former speaker of the Russian  Federation parliament, is very popular among the Chechens, and  many people dream of seeing him as head of state, because "he is  a real politician, whereas Dzhokhar Dudayev is more practically  oriented and has a poor understanding of foreign policy."    On 21 May, in honor of the end of the Russian-Caucasus War,  ChRI President Dzhokhar Dudayev issued an edict declaring that  from that time forward the day would be celebrated as the  republic's national holiday: the Day of the Beginning of  Caucasian Peoples' Rebirth. In addition he decided to delight  those attending the conference and apparently at the same time  demonstrate to them his firm decision to create an independent  state with all the appropriate attributes. He issued an edict  awarding banners to the republic's armed forces. Banners were  received by 12 units of Chechnya's regular army: the  presidential guard, the military college, the special operations  regiment (formerly the Abkhazian Regiment), the assault brigade,  the Shalinskiy Armor Regiment, the internal troops, the  firefighting troops, the border brigade, the missile and  artillery unit, the air force, the airborne troops, and the  aviation school. Then, to the tune of a military march and the  roar of low-flying fighter jets, the troops passed in review  before the generals and the president on Freedom Square. The  president was dressed in military uniform and was wearing all of  his USSR decorations and medals.    The president of the ChRI, accompanied by the  vice-president,  attended the conference all three days it was in session,  speaking twice. The second time was to deliver a report in which  he praised the democratic system of Chechnya, in the language of  which there is no word meaning "to order," and express sympathy  for the Russian people, whose tragedy, according to Mr. Dudayev,  lies in the fact that "atrocities have been elevated to the  level of a state program." In the opinion of Dzhokhar Dudayev,  today religion is emerging as the trump card, and it is time for  the Islamic peoples to establish a world religious center,  either in Chechnya, or in Tibet, or in Jerusalem. In addition,  he proposed the establishment of a Caucasian home "without  slaves and masters," as well as Baltic and Central Asian homes,  all of which would then be united on a peaceful basis.    The conference included in its final resolution the idea of  establishing a World Islamic Center either in the Caucasus or in  Jerusalem. From Russia it demanded legal recognition that  genocide has been committed, recognition of the ChRI's  independence, and the immediate commencement of negotiations.  The U.N. Security Council, the resolution stated, should be  stripped of its special powers and the international  organization that guarantees the rights and freedoms of people's  "radically reformed."</p>

			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSICAL STANDARDS  </P> <P> I wish to respond to some of the recent letters depicting Martin Bernheimer as  jaded and an overcritical critic. Although, as we know, it is his job to give  an objective and critiqued account of the operas we all so love, it is also his  job to pillar high standards of the stage, to keep Mozart Mozart and not Piggly  Wiggly pop.  </P> <P> I found the "dreamscape" sequence and 16th-Century wigs in "Idomeneo" a little  too cute.  </P> <P> I have never found Bernheimer vicious, or perhaps I have never found him  vicious enough. His critiques are always constructive. That is, something could  be done to improve the play.  </P> <P> In my opinion, Los Angeles and the Los Angeles Times are fortunate to have him.  </P> <P> ALLAN MacMORRES, Woodland Hills  </P></p>

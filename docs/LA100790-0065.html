			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> NEW SYSTEM LETS STUDENTS PHONE IN ANSWERS TO TESTS  </P> <P> Dial "D" for diploma.  </P> <P> University students can now take exams from the comfort of their own homes  using a telephone message system called Telequiz.  </P> <P> "I love it, but I don't know why," said student Jean Pajak. "Maybe it's the  spontaneity of it."  </P> <P> In what is believed to be first student testing via touch-tone telephone,  students at suburban Governors State University called in the answers to their  Psychology 519 quiz on Sept. 29-30  </P> <P> They answered by punching in numbers that were registered with computerized  voice-mail equipment.  </P> <P> Pajak and classmates took a 10-question multiple-choice quiz, punching the  numbers 1 through 4 on their tough-tone phones to register their answers with a  school computer.  </P> <P> Students taking Management 421 will also try the program, taking an exam of 15  true-or-false questions by pressing 1 for true or 2 for false.  </P> <P> "It's a replacement for the old-fashioned No. 2 lead pencil," said Donald  Fricker, a professor of management information systems who developed the idea.  </P> <P> Fricker said Telequiz saves time and money.  </P> <P> "I can administer any quiz in just two or three days as opposed to where the  secretary has to type it, I have to copy it, the class has to meet, and I still  have to grade it," he said.  </P> <P> The system also eliminates the need to travel to the college in suburban  University Park. The 5,000-student school has no dormitories, and many students  have outside job and family responsibilities.  </P> <P> The system lets instructors record up to 30 questions. It can handle just one  student at a time.  </P> <P> Quiz-takers have six or seven seconds to think of an answer before the next  question is asked -- too short a time for a student to cheat by looking up the  answer in a book, Fricker said.  </P> <P> In November, Telequiz will be demonstrated to representatives of 600 schools at  the annual Computers on Campus conference in Myrtle Beach, S.C.  </P> <P> Teresa Barker took her psychology test sitting at the kitchen table after she  had cleared the dinner dishes.  </P> <P> "Being at home, it was different than being somewhere where there's a lot of  pressure," said Barker, 52, a child-welfare worker pursuing an undergraduate  degree.  </P> <P> The system "gives a student tremendous flexibility," Fricker said. "The student  can be at his most relaxed. He can call in at 4 a.m. if that's when he's  achieved nirvana and feels he knows the material."  </P></p>

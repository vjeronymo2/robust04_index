			<p>BFN     [Text] Montevideo, 12 May (EFE) -- Uruguayan Interior  Minister Raul Iturria tendered his resignation today so as to be  able to devote himself to electoral activities and run for the  post of mayor of Durazno, 196 km north of Montevideo.    Iturria was elected Durazno mayor twice. He resigned as  Durazno mayor late last year to become interior minister,  replacing Juan Andres Ramirez, who will be the ruling party's  candidate to replace President Luis Alberto Lacalle.    Iturria said he would remain in his post until Lacalle  appoints his replacement.    The Interior Ministry will control domestic security and  guarantee the normal development of the elections scheduled for  29 November.</p>

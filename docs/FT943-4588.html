			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Inquiry 'cleared Brent Walker' An investigation by Brent Walker in 1989 into press claims about irregular transactions by its film division was thorough and proved there was nothing improper, Mr George Walker, the company's former chairman, told an Old Bailey jury yesterday. Giving evidence in his defence Mr Walker said the allegations that two transactions selling film rights worth more than Pounds 7m had not been carried out at proper 'arms length' caused him considerable concern. 'It was very important to me because we were being accused of malpractice in the company,' he said. Mr Walker and Mr Wilfred Aquilina, a former Brent Walker finance director, deny charges of theft, false accounting and conspiring to falsify the company's accounts. Mr Walker said the inquiry, by outside lawyers and accountants, proved the transactions were 'totally right'. The trial continues today.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Capability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter suggested that we revise the regulation to permit a hospital to transfer an unstabilized patient when it does not have the personnel or equipment to stabilize the patient's condition within the meaning of the statute.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  No revision is necessary. A hospital is only required to treat individuals with the staff and facilities available at the hospital. Under &sect;482.55(b)(2), a hospital must have available ``adequate medical and nursing personnel qualified in emergency care to meet the written emergency procedures and needs anticipated by the facility.'' Subject to the discussion below concerning on-call physicians, if the hospital does not have at its disposal the personnel or equipment necessary to stabilize a particular person's emergency medical condition, section 1867(c)(1) of the Act permits an unstabilized individual to be transferred if (a) the individual or the individual's representative has been informed of the risks and benefits of the transfer and requests the transfer in writing; or (b) the individual has not refused an appropriate transfer and the physician signs a written certification that the benefits of appropriate treatment at another facility outweigh the risks associated with the transfer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter recommended that the services of on-call physicians should be considered in determining the capabilities of the staff and facilities ``available'' to conduct a medical screening examination and further treatment that may be necessary to stabilize the emergency medical condition or treat the labor. Another asked that the regulations specify that a hospital is deemed to be capable of providing emergency services in all fields in which the hospital is normally engaged, regardless of the staff's reluctance to be available for emergency services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We agree that on-call physicians and ancillary services should be considered available to the hospital. This was further clarified in section 6018(a)(1) of OBRA 89, which amended section 1866(a)(1) of the Act to require hospitals to maintain a list of physicians who are on call and available to provide treatment needed to stabilize individuals with emergency medical conditions. Accordingly, we have amended &sect;489.20 to include a new paragraph (r)(2) requiring hospitals to comply with this OBRA 89 provision. The statute (as revised by COBRA, OBRA 89, and OBRA 90) and the current regulations state that the hospital must provide a medical screening examination, within the capability of the hospital's emergency department, including ancillary services routinely available to the emergency department, to determine if the patient has an emergency medical condition. If a hospital chooses to meet its responsibility under &sect;482.55 to provide adequate medical personnel to meet its anticipated emergency needs by using on-call physicians either to staff or to augment its emergency department, then the capability of its emergency department includes the services of its on-call physicians.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The statute (as revised by COBRA, OBRA 89, and OBRA 90) and current regulations also require the hospital to provide whatever further examination and treatment are necessary to stabilize the medical condition or to provide for treatment of the labor within the staff and facilities available at the hospital. If a staff physician is on call to provide emergency services or to consult with an emergency room physician in the areas of his or her expertise, that physician would be considered to be available at the hospital.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We also believe that when COBRA was enacted, Congress intended that the resources of the hospital and the staff generally available to patients at the hospital would be considered available for the examination and treatment of individuals coming to the hospital's emergency department, regardless of whether staff physicians had heretofore been obligated by the hospital to provide services to those coming to the hospital's emergency department. This was also clarified by section 6211(a) of OBRA 89, which specifies that the capability of hospital emergency departments must include ``ancillary services routinely available to the emergency department.'' Therefore, if a hospital has a department of obstetrics and gynecology, the hospital is responsible for adopting procedures under which the staff and resources of that department are available to treat a woman in labor who comes to its emergency department.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter expressed concern about the liability of small rural hospitals because many times they are not equipped to treat certain emergencies, in which case the patient must be transferred. Another commenter asked if each hospital's emergency room is required to treat emergency psychiatric disorders regardless of the hospital's capabilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Neither the statute nor the regulations mandate that hospitals expand their resources or offer more services. Rather, they focus on a hospital's existing capabilities. The thrust of the statute is that a hospital that offers emergency services to some members of a community who need their emergency services (for example, those that can pay) cannot deny such services to other members of the community with a similar need.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] New Delhi, April 13 -- The Prime Minister said today  that any suggestion to restrict India's nuclear option would be  "unacceptable and unrealistic," in view of Pakistan's nuclear  weapons capability and the recent proliferation of such weapons.    In an address at the opening session of the Army Commanders'  Conference here, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao said that  non-proliferation measures must be universal and  non-discriminate and should include a specific time-frame.    This statement to senior Defence personnel assumes  significance in the context of the U.S. pressure on India to  sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.    Mr Rao said that India had always advocated peaceful use of  nuclear energy and continued to believe that non-proliferation  measures should not be selective in their application.    Speaking on allegations of human rights violations, the  Prime  Minister said that India's concern for the maintenance of human  rights was second to none.    He claimed that those who tried to extract capital out of  this issue should cease what he called their futile attempts to  malign Indian security forces.    "It would amount to an insult to the concept of human rights  to distort and misuse it for political exploitation and  slanderous propaganda," he said. He added that of late, there  had been a better understanding of India's performance and that  some success had been attained in dispelling the motivated  campaign against the forces.    The Pakistan-sponsored low intensity conflict in Kashmir was  a major challenge to the nation, Mr Rao said.</p>

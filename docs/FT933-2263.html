			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / The Week Ahead: Results due SHAREHOLDERS in Spring Ram await Wednesday's interim results with a sense of foreboding. Mr Roger Regan, the new chairman, has probably ordered a harsh examination of the troubled kitchens and bathrooms group's fortunes after being brought in by institutions following three profits warnings and a share price collapse. Analysts are in the dark about what figures to expect, but will want to be reassured that no black holes are lurking in the accounts of the fallen stock market favourite. Tesco, the UK's second biggest grocery retailer, is expected on Tuesday to announce a 6 per cent increase in interim profits from Pounds 253m to about Pounds 268m. In spite of the expected increase, the figures are unlikely to improve market sentiment concerning Tesco, especially as Mr Archie Norman, chief executive of rival supermarket group Asda, may make further pessimistic observations about saturation in the UK food market at that company's annual meeting on Wednesday. William Morrison Supermarkets, the supermarket chain based in the north and Scotland, reports on Thursday and is expected to lift pre-tax profits from Pounds 36.2m last time to between Pounds 43m and Pounds 45m. The benefits of tactical pricing, adopted six months ago, should now be accruing, though Asda might have made a small impact on market share. The dividend is likely to be lifted from 0.16p to between 0.19p and 0.2p. MAI, the financial services group which reports annual profits on Monday, is expected to unveil a 9 per cent increase to about Pounds 78m before tax. The growth will have been fuelled by a 20 per cent rise in the wholesale broking arm. Shareholders are expected to be rewarded with a 10 per cent rise in the dividend to 6.6p. Hays, the business services group, is expected to report full-year profits of about Pounds 66m on Tuesday. Analysts had forecast a figure as high as Pounds 75m until the interim results in March, which were at the bottom end of expectations. Interest will focus on the pace of recovery in the UK and the group's growing European ambitions, following its acquisition of a German contract distributor in July. Analysts are undecided about Thursday's half-year pre-tax results for Guinness, the brewing company, and have made forecasts of between Pounds 305m and Pounds 338m, against Pounds 353m, for the six months to June 30. A dividend of about 3.7p (3.35p) is expected. The market will be looking for progress in the company's Spanish beer operations, will be watching the price of spirits in a competitive market and will be checking the size of any currency gain. Fashion retailer Next is reporting on Wednesday and interim profits are expected to double from Pounds 8.3m to about Pounds 17m. Analysts are hoping to confirm that recovery is not faltering, and are expected to quiz management about plans for a joint venture in the US.</p>

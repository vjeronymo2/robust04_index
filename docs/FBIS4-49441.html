			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Last evening, the provincial government held an  urgent teleconference on production safety in order to circulate  information on the serious gas explosion accident that took  place on 1 May in the Pingku coal mine under the (Fengchang)  Mining Bureau, as well as the workplace injury incident that  took place at the (Xingyi) power station construction site. The  government urged that earnest lessons be drawn, which have been  paid for with blood, and that powerful measures be adopted to  effectively ensure safety in production. At the teleconference,  which was presided over by Vice Governor Shu Shengyou, Governor  Wu Guanzheng and Vice Governor Zhang Yunchuan delivered  important speeches. The meeting urged that All localities  should uphold the idea of safety first and of putting prevention  first, and effectively strengthen leadership over production  safety work. The leading comrades of various localities,  departments, and enterprises should learn these lessons, which  have been paid for in blood from these two malignant accidents,  which caused injuries and deaths; further understand the  importance and urgency of strengthening production safety from  the heights of maintaining stability and accelerating  development; and enhance the sense of responsibility and urgency  in doing a good job in production safety in the spirit of being  highly responsible to the party and the people. Efforts should  be made to conduct thoroughgoing education in production safety  and to comprehensively enhance the sense of production safety  among the broad masses of employees. [passage omitted]    The principal leaders of administrative bodies in various  localities and departments, as well as representatives of  enterprise legal persons, are those who assume principal  responsibility for production safety in their own departments  and units. They should personally take up and check production  safety work. [passage omitted]    The production safety work in key trades, enterprises, and  units should be effectively strengthened. All departments --  particularly coal, chemical industrial, and metallurgical  production enterprises; inflammable and explosive goods  production, warehousing, and transport units; the building  industry; and the communications and transportation sector --  should further strengthen safety management in key enterprises  in line with the principle of paying simultaneous attention to  both production and safety. [passage omitted]    The meeting urged the launching of a mass production-safety  survey throughout the province. Effective measures should be  taken to earnestly handle hidden safety problems, if discovered.  [passage omitted]</p>

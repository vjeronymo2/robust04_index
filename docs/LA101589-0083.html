			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STEIN ON OAKLAND  </P> <P> It's too bad Gertrude Stein didn't live to see the A's make it twice in a row  to the World Series as she would have been happy to know Oakland did, indeed,  have something there.  </P> <P> A group of us visited her in Paris while we were waiting for our division, the  82nd Airborne, to be shipped home. Several of us were sent to the Sorbonne for  a course in the French language and civilization.  </P> <P> When she found that one of our group was from Oakland she said, "Il n'y a rien  la." Her French, of course, was excellent but to us it translated "there is no  there there." So started the meaningless phrase and its thousands of  explanations. Sacrebleu! Maybe her "rose is a rose is a rose is a rose" can be  explained the same way.  </P> <P> JOHN G. WATKINS  </P> <P> San Juan Capistrano  </P></p>

			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / International Company News: Staff rush to go under GM jobs cut plan GENERAL MOTORS' efforts to cut its labour force received a boost yesterday when the United Auto Workers' union announced that some 16,500 workers had signed up for a special early retirement programme - far more than originally expected. The company, which is trying to reduce its workforce as part of a plan to return its loss-making North American operations to profit, announced the early retirement programme last December. The deadline for acceptance was March 1. The union originally estimated that some 7,000 workers might accept the offer.</p>

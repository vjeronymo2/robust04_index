			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Hector Adorno] </F>   [Text] In connection with the technical cooperation  agreements maintained by the Mexican and French Governments to  fight drugs and crimes resulting from that social evil, the  National Institute To Combat Drugs [INCD], now under the  direction of Rene Paz Horta, has arranged and organized a course  for dealing more effectively with the drug traffic. The Attorney  General's Office [PGR] announced yesterday that the course will  be given to Mexican federal police forces by French police  specialists.    The federal institution of justice noted that the course, to  be taught by three instructors from the French National Police  "elite group," is titled "Updating of Intervention Techniques  for Groups Specializing in the Drug Traffic." It is intended for  approximately 20 agents from the Federal Judicial Police [PJF]  counternarcotics sector, as well as 10 more from the  interception group of the PGR's National Institute To Combat  Drugs.    The PGR stressed that by offering this type of course, the  INCD is redoubling its efforts aimed at combating drugs. It  explained that the course, which opens today, will be held at  the institute's headquarters and at various metropolitan police  facilities. It includes topics relating to techniques for  search, assistance, and intervention in fighting the drug  traffic, as well as monitoring, surveillance, and arrests of  dangerous criminals, and penetration of buildings and premises  in which criminals are operating.    It indicated that the French specialists' program of  activities includes the presentation of equipment and weapons  used by the "RAID" (French National Police elite group), and of  its organizational structure, based on activities including  search, assistance, intervention, and deterrence of criminal  groups.    In conclusion, it remarked that the course will be  coordinated by the INCD's General Directorate for Corporate  Development. It is to be given by Jean Marc Fata, Bernard Joly,  and Damien Lecoq, experts in the battle against organized crime,  under the supervision of Christophe Chadoud. The latter is  principal commissioner of the international police technical  cooperation service at the French Embassy in Mexico.</p>

			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Wheat output drive goes into reverse Saudi Arabia is restricting this year's subsidised wheat crop to 2.8m tonnes and will reduce its future harvests to no more than 2m tonnes under a strict regime of subsidy cuts and tight control of wheat farming permits, according to Mr Abdallah Moammar, the kingdom's deputy minister of agriculture. The grain harvest will be complete at the end of December, but Mr Moammar said his ministry and the state Grains and Silos Organisation had issued permits only for cultivation of 2.8m tonnes of wheat, and 1m tonnes of barley. 'We know the farmers in these regions will meet these targets,' he said. 'If farmers produce any more, that's not going to be our responsibility.' Mr Moammar said the cash-strapped kingdom had been putting an end to years of hugely generous subsidies for wheat farming, which had seen annual harvests hit 4.7m tonnes and at one point made Saudi Arabia the sixth biggest wheat exporter. 'There will be no more exports of wheat,' the deputy minister said. The subsidy programme began in the mid-1970s when Saudi Arabia decided to plough some of its new oil riches into a strategic bid for food self-sufficiency. At the time the kingdom produced only 3,000 tonnes of wheat a year. The policy was prompted partly by fears that the west might respond to the Arab oil embargo, backed by Saudi Arabia at the time, with a food embargo of its own. But Mr Moammar said the overproduction of wheat caused by over-generous subsidies, had become 'too much to handle . . . it was a waste on both sides: of water and money.' The deputy minister said wheat subsidies had been running at Dollars 2.5bn a year before recent cuts - a sum justified not merely by the aim of food security but also as sharing some of the kingdom's 1970s and early 1980s oil bounty across the country while helping prevent a rush from rural to urban communities. 'It was a high cost, but the eventual results have meant a lot to the kingdom,' said Mr Moammar. He would not say how much of Saudi Arabia's limited underground water supplies wheat farming had consumed - some estimates put it at 90 per cent of annual use of fossil water - and denied that there was an immediate threat the kingdom's overall water supplies. 'It has still not reached the level where there should be major concern,' he said. 'But it should be given attention from now. Now, with the controls being applied, this will help.' He said subsidies of SR3.5 (93 US cents) a kilogram had been cut in recent years to SR2, while licences for wheat cultivation had been strictly controlled. 'Harvests will continue to go down until we reach 2m tonnes,' he explained, 'because that will give us what's needed for local consumption and strategic reserves.' He said annual domestic consumption of wheat in the kingdom was 1.3m tonnes and national storage capacity was 2.4m tonnes. Mr Moammar said some land formerly under wheat had been left fallow since the cuts in both state subsidies and purchases, while other farmers had begun planting vegetables on the swathes of pivot-irrigated circles of reclaimed desert that were once under wheat. 'The whole agricultural development in the kingdom is such an experiment,' he said. 'And it's time to sustain this experiment, but you don't need to expand it more.'</p>

			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / World News in Brief: Three months' grace for Pounds 7.6m statue Campaigners hoping to keep Canova's The Three Graces in Britain were given an extra three months to raise the money needed to stop the statue going to the Getty Museum in California which has bought it for Pounds 7.6m. The decision by national heritage secretary Stephen Dorrell follows the announcement of a joint rescue package by the London-based Victoria and Albert museum and the National Gallery of Scotland in Edinburgh. They have committed Pounds 1m to the fund set up to buy the work, which has reached Pounds 5.8m.</p>

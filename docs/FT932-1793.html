			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Collaborating with the customer to make the magic circle - Andrew Baxter examines the strategy behind Stadco's success in winning its first order from a German carmaker FEW THINGS cheer hard-pressed manufacturers so much as winning a first-ever contract in a difficult foreign market against entrenched rivals. When that market is Germany, UK exporters need all the help they can get. In March, Shrewsbury-based Stadco, part of publicly-quoted Hall Engineering (Holdings), announced a Pounds 21m order from Audi, part of the Volkswagen group, to supply vehicle assembly equipment and related tooling - its first order from a German-owned car company. Last September's devaluation of the pound against the D-mark helped, says Mr Alan Mace, Stadco's managing director. But the victory was also the result of months of close technical and commercial collaboration between the two companies in a market where suppliers increasingly need to get in early if they are to influence production processes. Devaluation could not have come at a better time for Stadco. Coupled with the German motor industry's new found commitment to outsourcing components and manufacturing equipment beyond its traditional domestic suppliers, the company has a special opportunity to expand its presence in the European automotive market. Mr Mace wants to lift Stadco from the second tier of equipment suppliers up to, or close to, the hallowed inner circle of three big European suppliers: Comau of Italy and Kuka and Thyssen of Germany. As the carmakers reduce the number of suppliers with which they deal, Mr Mace wants Stadco to be on as many contract short lists as possible. But he also believes that the devaluation, and the experience gained from working with the Japanese car producers or the Japanese-influenced motor industry in the UK - such as Rover - puts Stadco in a good position to develop its automotive pressings business. Working with Japanese vehicle manufacturers in the UK has prompted Stadco to adopt their 'cost-down' approach, eliminating waste, implementing continuous improvement programmes, and tightening stock control in a way that has yet to be achieved by continental European pressing companies. German vehicle manufacturers, too, have been slow to specify Japanese production equipment, he says, but could buy from Stadco, which has incorporated some elements of Japanese 'lean' manufacturing techniques into its own equipment. Stadco is the successor to the old Chatwood Safe Company, which now survives as Stadco Security, the strong room supplier and builder. Together with Stadco Cooling, which makes industrial cooling systems, this represents only about 5 per cent of the business. The rest is automotive pressings - steel stampings and sub-assemblies - and automation, specialised equipment for assembling parts of a car body. And this is where Stadco has been growing. Orders received have jumped from a total of Pounds 25m in 1983 and 1984 to Pounds 115m in 1991 and 1992. Sales have risen from Pounds 11m in 1983 to Pounds 45m-Pounds 50m in each of the past two years. That compares with Hall's total turnover of Pounds 135.7m in 1992. Stadco's profits hit a peak of Pounds 4.86m in 1991, but slipped back last year to Pounds 2.94m, a reflection of the difficult conditions in the motor industry. In spite of the profits downturn, Mr Mace is confident about Stadco's future and its financial health. The company has been regularly generating cash since the mid-1980s, he says, and has sold more abroad than at home in five of the past 10 years. And, over the past decade, capital employed has only doubled while sales have more than quadrupled - due to tighter management controls and better negotiations on payment terms from customers. Behind the numbers, however, lies a change in strategy which Mr Mace believes rescued the pressings division from a 'slow, painful death.' In 1986 and 1987, the division was at the peak of its profitability, making large pressings for the automotive industry. But Stadco anticipated that customers would increasingly want to retain their large pressings in-house - to keep body-skin information private as long as possible, and to save on damage and transportation costs. The pressings business needed, therefore, to move into the market for smaller, higher value-added, sub-assemblies, which vehicle makers increasingly want to outsource. An example is a centre pillar assembly - 'not exactly a glamour item, but there is quite a lot of assembly involved,' says Mr Mace. The change of tack has proved correct, he says. 'Had we not moved out of simple, large pressings, we would not now be in business'. The automation division, meanwhile, is responding to the growth in its business and to the increasing size of individual contracts. The division's final assembly manufacturing space is being doubled to 40,000 sq ft. At the same time, the division is trying to encourage vehicle makers to leave it more of the detail of an assembly line design and take it into their confidence earlier through a process of simultaneous engineering. The aim is to reduce costs and cut lead times while minimising the risk of losing business if a contract is put out to bidding in the traditional way. Mr Mace has recently been looking at automation and pressings companies in France and Germany with a view to possible acquisition or joint venture. Working together could win business that would otherwise not have been available, he says. But Stadco remains heavily dependent on the automotive industry. 'We're exposed both to the production side and to the capital expenditure side,' says Mr Mace. Consequently, he is on the look-out for a 'third leg' for Stadco - either in a different part of the automotive industry or, preferably, a non-automotive business in a technology that Stadco understands. 'I'd feel more comfortable then,' he admits.</p>

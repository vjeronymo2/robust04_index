			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondent Dmitriy Gorokhov and </F> ITAR- TASS correspondent Georgiy Shelenkov]    [Text] Cairo May 5 TASS -- For the first time Russia and  the United States are unanimous in calling for a quadrilateral  ministerial conference on the settlement of the Bosnian  conflict. The conference will bring together representatives of  the Russian Federation, the United States, the European Union  and the United Nations to work out a single plan for the  settlement.    It can be surmised that in addition to the two great powers,  France, Germany and Britain, who are playing a prominent role in  unblocking the situation, are likely to take part in the talks.  The meeting will take place in Geneva "literally in the next  few days", according to a ranking official of the Russian  Ministry of Foreign Affairs.    The Geneva ministerial forum, according to the official, can  become a prologue to a summit, involving all interested  countries, as proposed by Moscow. The idea of a multilateral  conference is dictated by an understanding that the guarantees  of any one party cannot lead to the settlement of the conflict  but can only further exacerbate the problem.    The Russian official stressed that the prompt setting in  motion of a mechanism of multilateral negotiations is  necessitated by the volatile situation in the area of Brcko.  Bitter experience has made clear to every one where such  situations might lead. To achieve a universal end to combat  activities is now a high priority task, the official said.</p>

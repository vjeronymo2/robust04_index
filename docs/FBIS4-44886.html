This makes integrated  control possible not only for systems in the cabin like the air  conditioner, but for drive systems like the engine. Since  vehicle functions will expand in the future, this technology  will have a position in the communication infrastructure. Three  communication LSIs were developed in this project. However, when  they will be installed in mass-produced vehicles remains  undecided.    Today, high-speed, large capacity networks that can't be  used  now are being constructed and made ready to meet future demand.  This is the groundwork for creating an infrastructure typified  by the information superhighway in the United States.    Advanced PALMNET developed by Mazda and Furukawa Electric is  a multiplex communication system (automotive LAN) to provide a  communication infrastructure inside vehicles. The introduction  of 1-Mb/s LAN inside vehicles will enable integrated control of  not only electronic devices in the cabin like the air  conditioner, but will extend control to devices in the drive  system like the engine and suspension. (See Figure 1 which  appeared in Nikkei Electronics, 14 March 1994, p.  9.)[.sup]1[/] In line with this objective, three  communication LSIs were developed (Table 1).   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-028L-35A>      Figure 1. Example System Configuration of the LAN Developed for Vehicles. The two configurations are a low-and </FIG>  medium-speed LAN with its 125 kb/s transmission speed and a  high-speed LAN with its 1 Mb/s transmission speed. Three  communication LSIs were developed. The low- and medium-speed LAN  has the Basic-IC as its core 8-bit microprocessor for control  and the I/O-IC that integrates only data transmission and  reception functions. The high-speed Hi-IC is a communication LSI  that is connected to an existing control microprocessor.  &lt;annot&gt; Key: 1. Air conditioner; 2. CPU core; 3. Meter related  (navigation); 4.

The standard access method is  carrier-sensing multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD).    <H5>  Preparing for the Next Generation </H5>   The time frame for installing this system in mass-produced  vehicles is still undecided. The 20-kb/s PALMNET developed by  both companies in 1989 was installed in Eunos Cosmo, a  mass-produced car. Its goals were to control cabin systems, like  air conditioning, and fault diagnosis.[.sup]2[/]    Rather than being a product for the immediate future, Mazda  considers Advanced PALMNET to be a part of the communication  infrastructure provided for the next generation of vehicles that  will be safely driven under electronic control and will use the  Vehicle Information and Communication System (VICS) for  navigation. According to Furukawa Electric, the three  communication LSIs developed here are practical devices that can  be installed in mass-produced vehicles (Figure 2).  &lt;graphic&gt;  &lt;capt&gt; Figure 2. Evaluation Board. The three communication LSIs  developed here are finished products that can be installed in  mass-production vehicles.&lt;/graphic&gt;     First, installation will begin with luxury cars in which the  number of wire harnesses (electrical lines for connections)  exceeds 1,000 lines. This is associated with a 10%  decrease in  costs. In addition, space efficiency will improve. For example,  a theft prevention system uses multiple sensors. Thus, if an LAN  is installed in a car, new wires do not have to be pulled again  from each part of the car to install the system.    When audio equipment is added on later, it can correspond to  a dealer's option and not a manufacturer's option.  <H5>  Compatibility with Communication Path Faults in ISO </H5> Proposals    The two LAN systems developed here for vehicles are a  high-speed 1-Mb/s LAN and a low- and medium-speed 125-kb/s LAN.  The high-speed LAN uses shielded twisted-pair wiring; the low-  and medium-speed version uses unshielded twisted-pair wiring.    A feature of the high-speed protocol is the Simultaneous  Data  Gathering (SDG) function. In one transmission frame, data can be  simultaneously collected from multiple nodes. This enables  concurrent processing of multiple sensor data as in 4-wheel  anti-skid brakes (4ASB) and 4-wheel steering (4WS).    In the high-speed LSI (Hi-IC), the innovation of a  driver/receiver is built in. So even when faults like short or  open circuits occur in the transmission line, communication is  possible. ISO (International Organization for Standardization)  proposes that transmission be possible in the presence of nine  types of faults. This LSI handles all of them.    When a fault occurs in either signal line of the  twisted-pair  wires, the shielded wire is used for transmission (Figure 3).  Usually, balanced transmission takes place in the twisted-pair  wires. In this case, this shielded wire is set to +2.5 V. When a  fault occurs in signal line A, the voltage level of  the shielded wire is set to +5 V and unbalanced transmission  takes place in signal line B and the shielded wire.  When a fault occurs in signal line B, the shielded  wire becomes 0 V.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-028L-37A>      Figure 3. Transmission during Fault Generation in the High-Speed LAN. </FIG>  In the high-speed LAN, there is a switching function for the transmission system to use the shielded wire as  the signal line when a fault like wire disconnection occurs.  This function is incorporated into the driver/receiver of Hi-IC.  (a) Normal operation: Balanced transmission uses signal lines A  and B. (b) Fault generated in signal line A: Unbalanced  transmission uses signal line B and the shield wire. (c) Fault  generated in signal line B: Unbalanced transmission uses signal  line A and the shield wire.  &lt;annot&gt; Key: 1. (a) Normal operation; 2. Signal Line A; 3.  Shield; 4. Signal Line B; 5.

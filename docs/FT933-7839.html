			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Sing Singapore - Courtesy, punctuality and fecundity have all been the subject of state campaigns Singapore's 2.8m inhabitants are living proof that patriotism, politeness and punctuality - even fecundity - can be marketed and advertised by governments in much the same way that washing powder is sold by soap manufacturers. For more than a decade advertising agencies on the island have done brisk business for a famously dirigiste government, bombarding citizens with campaigns urging them to love their country, turn up at wedding parties on time and flush the lavatory. The campaign to persuade people to have fewer babies was so successful that the anxious authorities have made a U-turn and are now pleading with them to have more. One of the pioneers in selling feelings rather than products in Singapore was the British-educated Richard Tan Kok Tong, a former defence official and head of the information ministry's psychological defence unit - wisely renamed the publicity department - who is now responsible for corporate advertising at Singapore Press Holdings. In 1981 on a visit to the UK, Tan was so impressed by the patriotic mood in London's Albert Hall on the last night of the Proms he decided to use songs to create what he calls a 'Ra] Ra] Rule Britannia kind of spirit' in multi-racial Singapore. The early hit song 'Stand up for Singapore' became the basis for a continuing campaign called 'Sing, Singapore'. And, since then neither the government nor the advertising industry has looked back. Ten years ago the defence ministry took the revolutionary step of using advertising to sell the idea of 'total defence' - involving civilians as well as troops. The SDollars 1m (Pounds 435,000) budget was at that time the largest in the history of Singapore, says Tan. 'I was given a special award by the industry before I left the government]' Last year the government bought advertising space worth SDollars 9.7m for its various campaigns, according to Survey Research Singapore, the island's main advertising research group. In the first half of 1993, the Family Life Education Programme, which features sugary, televised scenes of happy families in an attempt to encourage Singaporeans to have more children, was the fourth biggest brand campaign in the country and spent SDollars 1.93m - slightly less than Kentucky Fried Chicken. 'Government campaigns are quite sought after by advertising agencies,' says Rosalind Chan, group account director of J. Walter Thompson in Singapore. 'They do have pretty big budgets.' The Courtesy Campaign, for example, dates back more than 10 years and is still going strong with an annual budget of SDollars 600,000, in addition to corporate sponsorship. Among the government's latest targets are Singaporeans who are too greedy at buffet lunches; a poster bearing the slogan 'If we could only see ourselves sometimes' shows a man putting a whole lobster on a plate already groaning with noodles, meat, vegetables and prawns. Measuring the results and effectiveness of campaigns about such ambiguous notions as patriotism and politeness is inevitably a subjective affair. Non-Singaporeans, when questioned on the value of government campaigns are apt to laugh or groan. 'These gooey adverts on TV really are horrible if you come from a different cultural background,' says one westerner after watching a 'family life' spot. The consensus among Singaporeans, however, is that the campaigns do work in Singapore because the inhabitants are accustomed to official exhortations and even the young are accustomed to obeying them. Ivan Chong, president of the Association of Accredited Advertising Agents says: 'They grew up in a campaign society.' The main concern of agencies is that Singaporeans will suffer from 'campaign fatigue' - already the government assigns most of the dozen or so current campaigns to specific months to avoid overlaps. Some observers say that cosmopolitan, well-travelled young Singaporeans are less receptive to official browbeating than their elders and have even been known to mock government campaigns. 'They are not all robots here,' says one foreign businessman. Tan, however, could be viewed as a walking advertisement for the Singaporean campaigns. Not only did he meet his wife through the official match-making service of the social development unit, but he also launched the National Punctuality Drive at his wedding. A few late-comers to the wedding were shown the extent of their misdemeanour the next morning when they discovered themselves pictured with superimposed clocks in the newspaper. 'I was so worried that my relatives would scold me,' he says. Tan says the willingness of Singaporeans to respond to government campaigns is rooted in the belief that they inhabit a vulnerable, disparate nation of recent migrants surrounded by the large Moslem populations of Indonesia and Malaysia. 'We have a background where the people are told you're here as migrants and we either pull together or we get hanged together,' he says. 'It's against this sort of precondition that people can accept this sort of propaganda.'</p>

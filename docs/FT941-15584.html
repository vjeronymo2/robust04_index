			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Trust hospitals to publish chiefs' pay under ethics code Codes designed to strengthen ethical standards and accountability in the National Health Service were published yesterday in the wake of serious criticisms of mismanagement and financial waste. Boards running hospitals and health authorities will be required to declare members' private interests and income from NHS sources. This will mean publishing salary details of chief executives and other executive directors of trust hospitals, which previously did not have to be disclosed. The NHS's reputation for probity has been seriously dented by recent reports from the Commons public accounts committee on mismanagement in the West Midlands and Wessex regions. These concluded that at least Pounds 20m had been wasted in Wessex and Pounds 10m in the West Midlands, and spoke of evidence of conflicts of interest, concealment of information and shortcomings in managerial and financial control. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, said yesterday that criticisms from the public accounts committee and the Audit Commission were justified. All corporate and personal conduct in the NHS must be underpinned by accountability, probity and openness, and the new codes set out corporate standards that the public could expect to apply. The codes, drawn up by a working group established last year, will be introduced in April. Consultation on their final form will take place until February 18, but the main elements will include defining more clearly the functions of chairmen and non-executive members of NHS boards; require boards to establish audit and remuneration committees, and record all board members' private interests relevant to NHS business. Accounting, tendering and employment practices, said Mrs Bottomley, must reflect the highest personal standards. 'Chairmen and board members should act impartially and should not be influenced by social or business relationships. No one should use their public position to further their private interests.' Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, said the proposals would do little to raise NHS standards of accountability and did 'not begin to address the real concerns raised by the scandals in Wessex and the West Midlands'. The codes emphasise that it is unacceptable for any NHS board or individual to 'ignore public service values in achieving results'. Some trust hospitals have been criticised for paying senior executives salaries that are high by public-sector standards, or not disclosing remuneration details. Mrs Bottomley said she did not think it appropriate for her to set pay ceilings throughout the service. There might be local circumstances where it was appropriate to pay an above-average salary. The government hopes, however, that the requirement to publish details will eliminate any potential for abuse.</p>

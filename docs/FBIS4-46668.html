			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Valentin Khalin: "Businessmen: Tear Into </F> Space!"; the first paragraph is an introduction]    [Text] A scheduled International Scientific and Practical  Conference "Businessmen and the Economic Exploitation of Space"  will be held on 12 April, on Cosmonautics Day, in the  Trade-Industrial Hall of the Russian Federation. The fifth in  number, it, like the preceding four, was organized on the  initiative of Viktor Shchekochikhin, owner of the Zemlyane  Business Cooperation Association, president of the Russian Union  of Private Property Owners. Valentin Khalin, a DELOVOY MIR  reviewer, converses with V. Shchekochikhin:    "Viktor Vladimirovich," I addressed him, "allow me a leading  question: is a measure directed to the stars appropriate under  the conditions of the present-day economic decline?"    "It is more than appropriate! Incidentally with the  implementation of space programs we are capable of dragging the  sick Russian economy from the quagmire. A simple example. Once  at the NPO Molniya they showed me several stunning innovations.  These were, in particular, technological know-how projects for  the processing of vegetables and fruits, meat and milk products.  Such as Western soothsayers could not have dreamed of! Competent  engineering execution and a minimum of investment and we will  have excellent food products, losses in taking in the harvest,  transport and storage of agricultural products will be reduced  to zero. Is that not worth the candle for enterprising parties?"    "Another example. Space communication is five or six times  cheaper than cable or radio relay communication. Taking the  far-outlying provinces of our country into account, is it not  advantageous for businessmen and for local administrators to  invest capital in a promising, profitable business?"    "Experience has shown that the practical use of space  research yields a significant saving and the invested funds are  recouped in 5-7 years. For example, exploration for natural  resources of the land and ocean from space is capable of  ensuring a profit of about 7 rubles from 1 ruble of investment.  You have to ask yourself, why have a prospector drill holes at  random in the search for gold-bearing deposits if it is  possible, by investing capital, to receive clues from space? Or  consider the fishing enterprise. For weeks a ship explores the  depths of the sea until a school of fish is found. Is it also  not better to spend some money and receive reconnaissance  information from space?"    "So that is why our association twice a year -- on the Day  of  the First Satellite and on the Day of the First Cosmonaut --  holds business meetings of scientists and entrepreneurs."    "You have convinced me, and I hope, the reader as well. But  are the big money-bags taking the bait?"    "I can't say that the Zemlyane telephone is ringing off the  hook. Nevertheless, from conference to conference, over the  course of two and one-half years, there has been an undeviating  increase in the ranks of enthusiasts for a breakthrough into  space. Our future is there. In addition to the conversion of  high technologies on the ground, in the future it is necessary  to look for entry into airless space with entire factories --  metallurgical, biomedical, for the processing of radioactive and  other wastes. Yes, and cosmogonic problems also enter the field  of view of scientists in the process of exploitation of  circumterrestrial space. Man has entered near space, but already  there are projects for flights to other planets. They require  the efforts of many countries. Those entrepreneurs who even  today are making efforts to partake of the space `pie' are in an  advantageous position in comparison with those who are standing  by idly. For example, consider America. There a great many  private companies, large and not very large, are successfully  competing with the government space complex. The same situation  prevails in most countries which have joined in space research.  For example, last autumn, together with representatives of the  Ministry of Science and Technical Policy of the Russian  Federation, I visited Spain to study this experience. There the  national space program is financed for the most part by private  companies. And we Russians, are we any less?"    "In the conference program among its participants I see a  whole constellation of distinguished scientists, cosmonauts and  entrepreneurs: Gennadiy Alferenko, director of the  Europe-America Space Transfer Project, Vladimir Bashmachnikov,  president of the Farming Association, Yuriy Koptev, general  director of the Russian Space Agency, along with Konstantin  Borovoy, as well as Nikolay Rukavishnikov, president of the  Russian Cosmonautics Federation, Stanislav Smirnov, president of  the Russian Federation TPP, and Oleg Gartsev, board director of  the Merchants and Industrialists Society. But will the  authorities participate?"    "There also will be official representatives, in particular,  with a report on the prospects for the commercialization of  space research. The conference will take place during the day of  12 April at the Trade- Industrial Hall and in the evening its  participants are invited to a solemn session on the occasion of  Cosmonautics Day. Russian society is coming to the  understanding: the state space program along is unable to cover  the infinitude of required investments. The organizing committee  of the scientific-practical conference proposes that  businessmen, insurance companies, commercial banks and  representatives of regional administrations be ready to enter  into contact with specialists working on commercial projects in  the field of high technologies and materials, ecology,  monitoring and study of natural resources, space communications  and medicine..."    "It must be surmised that they will not come out of simple  curiosity; they will be seeking for themselves sources of  financing for commercial cosmonautics. And they will not be  losers. Their investments will pay for themselves a hundredfold."</p>

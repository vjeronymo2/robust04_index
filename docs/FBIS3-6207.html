			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, March 15 (YONHAP) -- Rep. No Chae-pong of the  ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) lodged a strong protest  with the Democratic Party [DP] Monday, slamming the DP's  in-house report that he and another DLP lawmaker, Yi Chun-ku,  planned to form a new political party.    "Your report on current political trends is fictitious and  untrue," No said in the protest note.    "The Democratic Party has to take proper responsibility as a  legitimate party for preparing and distributing a false report,"  No demanded.    The DP's office of party affairs coordination submitted the  report in question Monday to the party's governing Supreme  Council.    The report, forecasting the future of domestic politics,  said  that many ruling party members who were active in the  administrations of Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u would bolt the DLP  and form a new party    They were already planning to do so in the belief that they  would not receive party nominations for the next parliamentary  elections in 1996 due to changes taking place in the DLP under  President Kim Yong-sam's political strategy, the report said.    No, former prime minister under No Tae-u, and Rep. Yi  Chun-ku, former DLP secretary-general, planned to form a new  party embracing disgruntled DLP members and former military  officers purged in President Kim's anti-corruption drive, the  report said.    In his protest note, No said, "DP Chairman Yi Ki-taek, as  the  leader of the party, has to apologize not only to myself and  Rep. Yi Chun-ku but also the Democratic Liberal Party, in which  both of us are party postholders."    Henceforth, the Democratic Party must try to maintain  dignity  and responsibility as a legitimate political party in dealing  with public affairs of a similar nature, No said.    There was no immediate reaction from Rep. Yi Chun-ku as he  is  currently visiting Germany.    Officials at the Democratic Party, meanwhile, admitted that  the two DLP lawmakers' honor could have been stained since their  names were mentioned in an official paper.    The party is looking into apologizing to the two men in the  name of the director of the office of party affairs  coordination, they said.</p>

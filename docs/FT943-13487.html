			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: London cocoa futures jump to 6 1/2 -year highs Cocoa futures shot to their highest levels for six and a half years in London yesterday, taking over the baton from coffee on largely speculative buying fed by fears that next year's supply deficit could be worse than expected. The London market took its cue from New York's performance on Friday, when futures surged to four-year highs on a burst of fund buying. Traders pointed to concern that the coming crop in the Ivory Coast, which produces a third of the world's cocoa output, could be hit by dry weather. The International Cocoa Organisation suggested in February that the deficit, the fourth in a row, could rise to 209,000 tonnes in 1994-95 after a projected 110,000 tonnes this year. 'Coffee has had an effect,' said one analyst. 'People have realised how explosive things can become when you're in a situation of structural deficit.' He pointed out, however, that the likely size of the Ivorian crop would not be known for about six weeks. Buying interest in New York and London was also fuelled by concern that labour unrest in the Nigerian oil industry could spread, and that Brazil, another large producer, might suffer a port strike. The September position in London broke through the Pounds 1,100 mark to a day's peak of Pounds 1,112 a tonne but met profit-taking and closed Pounds 25 higher at Pounds 1,093. New York's September futures position added to Friday's advance in early trading but backed off to Dollars 1,508 a tonne in afternoon trading, down Dollars 14. Coffee trading, meanwhile, had a thin day in London, consolidating last week's record gains. The second position closed Dollars 53 lower at Dollars 3,775 a tonne.</p>

			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / More deadly at the Mail The sudden appearance of Mr Paul Dacre as editor of the Daily Mail could be tiresome news for Mr John Major. Let me explain. The prime minister was, shall we say, assisted in his endeavours to win the election on April 9 by a solid and unanimous Tory press which heavily outnumbered the few opposition papers. All of it stuck to a script that I assume was written at Central Office. The Daily Mail did its bit, con brio. The Conservative papers rubbished Mr Neil Kinnock, and helped spread the idea that Labour would add huge amounts to everyone's personal taxation. Mr Major duly won. Since then, as is proper in a democracy, those same newspapers have been all over the place. The prime minister still gets a good press, but no organ can be relied upon to support the government, certainly not on every issue. This is as it should be. I would not remark upon other publications at all, but for the fact that the official opposition has been dormant since April 10. The consequence is that the only significant alternatives to strategies made in Downing Street have been put forward from the Conservative benches - and in parts of the Tory press. The two wings of this internal opposition draw natural support from one another. Many of the Conservative papers have become either uncomfortable doubters or hostile opponents of the prime minister's European and economic policies. The Maastricht treaty has few friends. The maintenance of Britain's position within the exchange rate mechanism is seen solely in terms of its upwards pressure on interest rates. Maastricht and the economy have become bound together. They are twin albatrosses slung around Mr Major's neck. The significance of Mr Dacre's appointment is that the Daily Mail, which my moles say was anyhow getting ready to move towards becoming an uncomfortable doubter, may now be roughly manoeuvred into a stance of open hostility. The evidence is to be found in the Evening Standard, a London newspaper, which Mr Dacre edited until last week. He moved it steadily rightwards. He featured Sir Alan Walters, scourge of the ERM and Maastricht, and the man whose presence by Mrs Margaret Thatcher's side was given as a reason for the resignation of Mr Nigel Lawson as chancellor. The treaty of which Mr Major is so proud was referred to in editorials as the 'ex-Treaty of Maastricht'; just a fortnight ago the Standard devoted an entire editorial page to an attack on Britain's membership of the ERM. Do not mistake me. It is a free country. I merely note what happened. No criticism of Mr Dacre's editorship is implied. I cannot say whether the Daily Mail will be moved in the same direction now that Sir David English has stepped down as editor and the man from the Standard has moved in. Under Sir David, the paper was staunchly pro-European, and pro-Major, although latterly it may have been getting ready to wobble. It is not known how free the new editor will be; his predecessor, a life-long hands-on operator, will sit above him as editor-in-chief of the Associated Newspapers group. The likelihood is that some turn against Maastricht and the ERM can be expected; the interesting question is how much and how soon. This could be troublesome for the government. The pulse of the Conservative party beats through the Daily Mail, just as its heartbeat can be found in The Daily Telegraph. The latter is also sounding an increasingly uncertain note. I have only once heard its proprietor, Mr Conrad Black, speak on European Community matters; my recollection is of a man who out-Thatchers Thatcher. His Sunday Telegraph has become a last redoubt for her admirers. Meanwhile The Times, still under the editorship of Mr Simon Jenkins, has been scornful of the Maastricht deal ('an invitation to an ever more interventionist bureaucracy'), while The Sun has conducted a running campaign to get Mr Norman Lamont to cut interest rates ('Do it, Norman'). In compensation, the Evening Standard may become less rightwing under its new editor, Mr Stewart Steven, who until this weekend ran a more or less loyalist Mail on Sunday. But a favourable London evening paper would be no antidote to an unfavourable Daily Mail. You may say that none of this matters - that it is just musical chairs at the papers again. This could be so, but consider the government's position. It has bolted itself in to a policy of ratifying Maastricht (unless, blessedly, there is a French veto) and sticking out the recession for as long as it takes. It needs all the public support it can get, at a time when everyone who is in work knows of someone either out of it or in trouble finding a job. Mr Major and Mr Lamont have recently started to try to talk their own party, and the electorate as a whole, into an understanding of why interest rates cannot be summarily lowered, and why it is necessary to honour the Maastricht accord. They cannot rely on a docile press to assist them. They will have to depend on the force of their arguments. Wonderful.</p>

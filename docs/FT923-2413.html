			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / International Company News: Dairy Farm International up 10% at halfway DAIRY Farm International, the food retailing arm of the Jardine Matheson group of Hong Kong, said net profits grew 10 per cent to USDollars 59.9m for the six months to June. Earnings were held back by significant losses from Spanish retailer Simago. The company's Hong Kong retail oper-ations saw shrinking margins due to higher wages and rental rates, and with 561 stores now open, the market is reaching saturation level. However, Taiwan is expected to provide substantial growth. Dairy Farm has now opened 51 Wellcome and Mannings stores and the company predicted it would move into profit in the latter part of 1992. The group's Australian retailer Franklins achieved increased profits and maintained market share in the face of a severe recession and fierce competition. The company plans to accelerate new store expansion in the second half. Woolworths New Zealand, which was acquired in 1990, achieved significant profits growth and successfully in-creased its market share. Dairy Farm's 50 per cent owned Maxim's restaurant chain produced excellent results in Hong Kong. The HKDollars 1.25bn (USDollars 162m) sale of a 51 per cent stake in Dairy Farm's manufacturing businesses in China and Hong Kong to Nestle, the Swiss food group, which was announced in June, should lead to interest savings in the second half of the year. The company's 25 per cent owned associated Kwik Save continued to register growth in spite of the weak UK economy, with interim profits up 8 per cent. Overall, most analysts expect a better performance in the second half of the year, aided by strong growth in Taiwan and New Zealand. The company also said profit margins had shown a slight improvement at Simago. Turnover was 5 per cent higher at the interim stage at USDollars 2.325bn and the company recommended a dividend of 1.48 cents, up from 1.35 cents.</p>

			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / International Company News: BZW loses role in Hungarian sell-off BARCLAYS de Zoete Wedd, the UK merchant bank, has been dropped as adviser on the privatisation of Kobanyai Sorgyar, Hungary's largest brewery, after a dispute with government authorities. Hungary's State Property Agency, the privatisation authority, said yesterday that BZW had invited bids for the brewery from three international companies which the government had specifically excluded from the sale tender. BZW strongly denied the agency's claims. 'BZW has complied with all the instructions it has received,' the firm said in a statement. A Barclays executive characterised the problem as one of poor communication, and criticised the SPA for jumping to conclusions. The SPA said prospectuses for Kobanyai went out to Interbrew, Heineken and Brau - western brewers which have all established strong market shares in Hungary - even though the SPA wanted to stop them making further acquisitions in the interests of competition. Mr Lajos Csepi, managing director of the SPA, said yesterday: 'It is a very elementary mistake which cannot be explained.' This is the first time the SPA has publicly dismissed a consultant. Mr Csepi also said he was dissatisfied with BZW's work on its other important mandate, the privatisation of Centrum Department Stores. BZW was one of the first investment banks to explore Hungary, and advised the SPA itself at the organisation's foundation in 1990. BZW remained hopeful that it could assuage the SPA in further talks and contain the damage to relations to avoid blacklisting. But Mr Csepi said the SPA was considering removing BZW from the shortlist of advisers for the much-coveted privatisation work on Hungary's four large commercial banks.</p>

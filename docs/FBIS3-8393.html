			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Budapest, 8 March (MTI) -- The Hungarian  representative in the Danube Commission recently forwarded a  letter to representatives of the other member states, Hungarian  Foreign Affairs Spokesman Janos Herman announced on Tuesday [8  March].    In the letter, the Hungarian Government, citing the February  tragedy of the Ukrainian tugboat, reminded the member states of  the Danube Commission that the Slovak Government, in serious  violation of its international contractual obligations,  rechanneled the Danube river flow in a 40-kilometer section from  the river's natural bed, previously used for international  shipping, and has thus prevented navigation on this section.    In order to fully enforce the safety and freedom of Danube  shipping, the Hungarian Government considers it necessary for  the Danube Commission to call on the Government of the Slovak  Republic to continuously provide the necessary water amount in  the natural bed of the Danube in order to restore the original  conditions of navigation, as was previously demanded by the  Hungarian side.    The Hungarian Government also deems it necessary for the  Danube Commission to call on Bratislava to restore the official  announcement system which has not been in force since the  Gabcikovo facility was unilaterally placed into operation.  Under the terms of the system, the Danube Commission, and  through it the governments of the countries concerned, must  immediately be informed of all circumstantial events -- for  instance, the serious accident in February.    However, the Danube Commission has still not received any  such notification concerning the Ukrainian boat accident.    The Hungarian Government has requested that the Commission  place these issues on the discussion agenda for the session next  month.</p>

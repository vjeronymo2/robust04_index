			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "With Growing Numbers of Unemployed and Sharp Job </F> Competition, Shandong's Job Prospects Are Not Optimistic"]    [Text] As enterprise operating forces are being converted  and reform of our labor employment system is being steadily  intensified, Shandong's urban job prospects for 1994 are not  optimistic.    Shandong's grim job prospects for 1994 can be seen mainly  in:  1) The numbers of urban unemployed are growing. By the end of  1993, Shandong had 236,000 urban unemployed due to structural  conversion, up 54,000 from 1992 which, in addition to the normal  increase in unemployment in 1994, will push our 1994  unemployment above that of previous years. 2) The numbers of  unemployed employees are up. Along with market changes and  industrial structural adjustment, certain enterprises will go  bankrupt or shut down, sharply increasing the numbers of  unemployed employees in 1994. Meanwhile, the unemployed will be  older and less able to find new jobs. 3) As reform intensifies,  the urban-rural and regional limitations on labor mobility will  be breached which, in addition to certain enterprises wanting to  employ the rural workforce, will decrease the job opportunities  for the urban unemployed. 4) Along with property rights system  reform, industrial structural adjustment, and technological  upgrading, the number of workers recruited by enterprises from  society will be down from previous years.    Our unemployment problem will be solved mainly through  economic growth. The sustained, rapid, and sound growth of  Shandong's economy will create many favorable job prospects.  While tertiary industries, township enterprises, and FIEs are  growing particularly fast, all providing certain job  opportunities, we will still have to rely mainly on jobseekers  facing up to their situation, by correctly understanding our  national employment policy, acting in line with market demand,  and improving their own skills and increasing their competitive  awareness to find jobs in line with their own qualifications.</p>

			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / TI chairman calls for devaluation BRITAIN should start discussions with its partners in the European exchange rate mechanism to allow a devaluation of sterling and an early cut in UK interest rates, according to Mr Christopher Lewinton, chairman and chief executive of TI, the engineering group. Mr Lewinton said such a move was necessary to ease the pain felt by the business community as a result of the recession. His comments reflect the deep unease of many industrialists about what he says is the 'punitively high' level of base rates, which have been held at 10.5 per cent for more than six months. The remarks are likely to reopen the debate about reducing the pound's DM2.95 central peg in the ERM. Ministers have ruled out a devaluation and many industrialists have been nervous about speaking publicly about such a move. Both groups have argued that even to consider the topic could jeopardise confidence in the pound on foreign exchange markets. But Mr Lewinton - who supports both the government and the general principles of the ERM - said he was confident ministers could achieve a devaluation in the context of an upward revaluation of the D-Mark, agreed to by Germany and other ERM members. 'It's not in Europe's interests to have a weakened UK,' said Mr Lewinton. 'There should be a way of allowing a serious cut in UK rates without disturbing the ERM club.' A reduction in base rates to increase industrial confidence and investment was the main economic priority for Britain, he added. Mr Lewinton was among a group of senior industrialists sounded out by the government last year for views on the economy. He said that in other countries where TI traded - such as the US, France, Italy and Germany - he did not sense the 'same lack of solutions' about economic problems as in Britain. He said: 'Britain is not thinking enough about growth. There is a lot of discussion about getting inflation under control, but you don't win by having just one goal.'</p>

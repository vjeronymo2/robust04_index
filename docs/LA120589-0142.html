			<p><P> December 5, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BAKKER ASSOCIATES INDICTED FOR PERJURY DURING PTL INQUIRY  </P> <P> A federal grand jury today indicted two associates of Jim Bakker for lying  during the PTL fraud investigation.  </P> <P> Sam Johnson, former minister at Heritage Village Church, was charged with 12  counts of perjury for his testimony about a $10,000 check that was part of  $265,000 in hush money paid to former church secretary Jessica Hahn.  </P> <P> Evangelist John Wesley Fletcher was charged with one count of perjury for his  testimony about how Bakker was introduced to Hahn.  </P> <P> "There will be no further PTL-related indictments coming out of this grand  jury," said Assistant U.S. Atty. Jerry Miller.  </P> <P> Fletcher introduced Bakker to Hahn before their sexual encounter at a Florida  motel room. Reports that Bakker used ministry funds to pay Hahn to keep quiet  about the liaison led to Bakker's resignation in March, 1987.  </P></p>

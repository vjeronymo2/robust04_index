			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / US moves carrier into Gulf: UN weapons inspection team prepares to return to Iraq THE US has moved the aircraft carrier America into the Gulf, as the United Nations prepares for an intensified effort to force Iraq to co-operate in eliminating its weapons of mass destruction. The move was disclosed as a UN inspection team prepared to return to Baghdad next week to continue its mission to track down Iraqi ballistic missile arsenals. US defence department officials said the aircraft carrier, which has about 80 warplanes, entered the Gulf on Thursday with an escort of a cruiser, a frigate and two supply ships. Officials cautioned that the US had maintained a considerable naval presence in the Gulf region for some time. The America was not the first US aircraft carrier to enter the Gulf since the end of the allied military operation that drove Iraq out of Kuwait last year. They said the US had 22 naval vessels in the Gulf, along with seven in the Mediterranean and five in the Red Sea and a strong naval presence would remain in the region as long as was necessary to enforce the UN economic embargo on Iraq. The latest move is regarded as a public display of US determination to put pressure on the regime of President Saddam Hussein, rather than a militarily significant deployment. The US in fact already has more than enough warplanes in place to strike at Iraqi targets if necessary. Although options are considered limited, President George Bush has said he would 'contemplate all alternatives' to press Iraq to obey UN orders. Mr John Major has indicated Britain does not rule out a military strike if Iraq defies the UN. The UN Security Council clashed with Mr Tariq Aziz, Iraq's deputy prime minister, at a meeting in New York this week over what the council said was Iraq's continued refusal to comply with terms of the Gulf war ceasefire. Visiting Iraqi experts led by General Mohamed Rashid Amir, a deputy minister of heavy industry, continued talks last night with UN officials in charge of the programme to dismantle Iraq's most dangerous weapons. Mr Rolf Ekeus, head of the programme, intends to despatch UN inspectors to Baghdad next week for another attempt to locate and eliminate the remainder of the ballistic missile arsenals. More than 60 missiles with a range of 150km or more have been destroyed, but the UN believes there are other secret stocks. It was announced last night that talks would resume in Vienna next week on how to arrange limited sales of Iraqi oil so that the country can buy food and medicines abroad. Talks were broken off last month, but the Iraqis agreed this week to make a new effort to reach an accord. The Iraqis have complained that the deal would operate in such a way as to violate their sovereignty. A UN resolution authorising sale of Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 900m) of Iraqi oil expires next week. But Mr Diego Arria of Venezuela, Security Council president, promised a decision would be made next week on whether to extend the authorisation.</p>

K. Zykov and V. N. Skorobogatykh, DIEKS </F> [unexpanded acronym]-Scientific Production Association, Central  Scientific Research Institute of Machine Building Technology;  UDC 621.186.7]    [Text] A description is provided of the principal  requirements contained in the Regulations on the System of  Technical Diagnosis of Thermal Power Steam and Hot-Water  Boilers.    Tens of thousands of small steam and hot-water boilers,  supplying communal and industrial needs for steam and hot water  are currently in operation in Russia. The constituents of this  thermomechanical equipment are heterogeneous both in design and  technological features and with respect to product service life,  safety and reliability factors, and other indices. More than  80% of the small boiler units produced before the  beginning of  the 1970s are operating at the present time beyond the limits of  the design operating life. The quality of operation remains a  significant problem for this equipment.    Under these conditions, operational reliability is  determined  entirely by the timely and effective implementation of measures  for the carrying out of technical diagnosis and by subsequent  repair and initial preparation operations. However, until the  present time a unified methodological and engineering approach  to the tasks of diagnosis and to the problem of rational  prolongation of reliable operating life has not been worked out.    Finally, instructional materials on the many modifications  of  small boilers, regulating the necessary scope and periods of the  monitoring of the state of the metal during the period of the  design service life, are lacking.    These problems have been eliminated by the Regulations on  the  System of Technical Diagnosis of Industrial Power Steam and  Hot-Water Boilers, developed by a collective of authors (Russian  Federal Mining and Industrial Oversight; the Scientific  Production Association, Central Scientific Research, I. I.  Polzunov Planning and Design Institute on Boilers and Turbines;  VNIIAM [unexpanded acronym - All-Russian Scientific Research  Institute of Nuclear Machine Building]; the Scientific  Production Association, Central Scientific Research Institute of  Machine Building Technology, boiler-building plants, and other  enterprises). The Regulations cover steam boilers with a  pressure greater than 0.07 MPa to 4.0 MPa and hot-water boilers  with a water-heating temperature greater than 115C. The  principle of ensuring safety during the assessment of the  technical status of boilers in relation to potentially dangerous  elements of construction or its components that are most  stressed, operating in the most severe and difficult conditions,  is the basis of the Regulations. The selection of potentially  dangerous components is made on the basis of information on the  design features of the boilers, the conditions of their  operation, and statistical data on their failure rate. The  frequency, methods, and scope of the monitoring of the technical  status of the boilers, as well as the norms of the evaluation of  the limiting condition with respect various diagnostic  parameters, are established by the Regulations on this basis.    The estimation algorithm for the technical status of the  boilers, the structure of which is designed for the period of  design service life as well as beyond its limit, is the  foundation in the Regulations for carrying out the diagnostic  operations. This structure includes the content and sequence of  the necessary stages of the operations to establish the  possibility and conditions of safe operation.    The content of the stages of the operations to assess the  technical status of boilers is set forth in the corresponding  sections of the Regulations: analysis of the the design features  and of the technology of the manufature and conditions of the  boilers (sec. 4); actual examination of boilers (sec. 5), which  includes the use of a complex of nondestructive monitoring  methods; the investigation of the condition and properties of  the metal (sec. 6), and, finally, check strength calculation and  estimation of residual life (sec. 7).    The norms for the assessment of the technical status on the  basis of the results of the technical diagnosis as applied to  the geometrical dimensions and to the mechanical properties and  defects of the basic metal and of welded, forged, and riveted,  joints, are presented in sec. 8.    The requirements for the formal presentation of the results  of the technical diagnosis and the prognosis of the possibility  and conditions of the further operation of the boilers are set  forth in the concluding sec. 9 of the general part of the  Regulations.    The analysis of the actual status of long-operating boiler  equipment is presented in the Regulations. The boilers are  divided in groups A and B, the first of which represents  equipment with operating periods within the limits of 20 to 40  years, the second of which, longer than 40 years. Critical  standards on the status of the construction elements, the  properties and structure of the metal, and the results of  hydrolic testing. The procedures in case of a deviation from  limiting conditions and designations of the following scopes of  diagnosis and repair, as well as the conditions of further  operation, are regulated.    Practical aspects of the technical diagnosis of various  types  of boilers are also considered in the Regulations; the program  of technical diagnosis of the most common types of boilers of  domestic manufacture, the MZK, E1/9, PKN, PTZM, PTVM, DKV, DKVR,  etc., within the limits of the design period and after its  expiration, are presented. In keeping with the approach adopted  in the main text of the Regulations, potentially dangerous  components of the design of boilers on the drawings are  considered, and the methods and scopes of criterional  evaluations of the technical diagnosis results indicated.  Recommendations are given for the formal presentation of the  results of the diagnosis and the preparation of the conclusions  regarding the possibility, periods, and conditions of the  further operation of boilers.    Overall the Regulations have been devised to provide  assistance to the operating personnel of industrial boiler,  installation, repair, and diagnostic enterprises and  organizations in the ensurance of the reliable and prolonged  operation of boiler equipment on the basis of the effective  solution of the problems of technical diagnosis.    The Regulations have been published and can be ordered  through the following address: DIEKS, 125047, Moscow, P. O. Box  37; tel. (095) 258-69-68.    COPYRIGHT: Rossiyskaya akademiya nauk.

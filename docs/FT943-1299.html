			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Travel: Along the trail of the trappers - On Safari / Michael J. Woods sails and canoes up the rivers and coast of Labrador The minke whale was heading west. Marine Atlantic's ship Northern Ranger was going east. We passed each other near Black Island at the mouth of the Churchill River on the coast of Labrador, each going about our business with single-minded concentration. The whale was pushing purposefully through the water and rising to breathe with a minimum of effort. I saw it only twice and then it was gone. The Northern Ranger had just called at Rigolet to discharge cargo and take on passengers. Now, just after 6am, the sea ahead was like silk - grey, glinting, smooth. The ship tore it apart and left it in shreds and tatters astern. Labradoreans rely on water - lakes, rivers or sea, liquid or frozen - to get about. Labrador has plenty of wilderness and few roads, fewer of them are surfaced. The trans-Labrador highway slashes across the widest part, a bumpy 350 miles from Labrador City to Goose Bay, and that is about it. To reach any of the coastal settlements you must take the coastal steamer in summer or drive a snow-mobile over the ice in winter. Or you can fly. Heavy loads come by boat. The forward hold of the Northern Ranger contained snow-mobiles, all-terrain vehicles, bundles of timber, great bags of sand and gravel, a three-piece suite, a kitchen and various domestic items. We passengers travelled behind. My roomy cabin had the widest bunk I have ever slept in. A favourite way to see the coast is to take a two-week return trip from the base at Lewisporte. Recognising this leisure use of their boats, Marine Atlantic, asked Labrador Scenic to provide a guide and a full itinerary for their holidaying guests. I joined at Goose Bay, a settlement founded around an airbase. From here we were taken in small boats across the Churchill to Mud Lake, the unalluring name of an attractive little village beside the lake. Narrow paths through tall grasses and groves of pink willowherb led from one colourful clapboard house to another. Huskies, in summer retirement, barked from their moorings in the surrounding woods and chortling children played by the river. We rejoined the Northern Ranger just before dark and at 10pm. She coiled her ropes aboard and we steamed away towards the north. As we went, the scenery changed. Trees became more infrequent and bare bed-rock, ground down and smoothed by millennia of ice, increased. Icebergs hovered on the horizon. We received word that three polar bears had been seen on the previous day on Quaker's Hat, an island noted for its thousands of breeding sea birds. Crowds hung over the rails as the ship drew near but the bears had gone. The ship hooted loud and long as we passed and the sky filled with anxious sea birds. At each settlement the ship became lighter as the hold emptied. This gave time for the passengers to look around although, although for some, it was never quite enough. Twice the ship had to return and pick up a lonely figure waving forlornly from the pier. Nain is the most northerly settlement on the coast and the turning point for the ship. After a tour of the town's sandy streets to see its sports hall, television station, fish plant and Moravian church, I walked up the hill behind. A short steep climb gave me a view north over wave after wave of inlets and islands much like those we had already passed. The thousands of miles of apparently empty countryside are home to bears and wolves and the largest caribou herd in the world. These animals, together with smaller fry such as foxes and martens, were the quarry of trappers and hunters who would spend all winter amassing meat and skins. After more than six months away from home in the toughest conditions - the temperature often hit 40 below - they would load their Canadian canoes to the gunwales and paddle home with the spring thaw to wives wondering anxiously if they had survived. Joe Goudie comes from such a family, his father and his uncle were trappers and Joe still has hunting in his blood along with a dash of Welsh, Scottish and Cree Indian. One time MP and now Native Liaison Officer for Canada's National Defence, Joe also leads canoe safaris down the Churchill River. After a night in a log cabin set in open spruce woods, we put the boat in the water, loaded it with tent, wood-burning stove, food, axe and saw and paddled away. The river was flowing quite swiftly especially in the early part of the journey where the water was most exciting although never dangerous. After that it was easy paddling and we passed gently through the wilderness. We kept our eyes open for moose and bear, drifted up to great northern divers and Canada geese and watched ospreys patrol overhead. The river widened into lakes and then closed around us again, dark walls of spruce and fir lightened by the brighter green of willow, alder and white trunked poplar by the waterside. On one high bank the trees were tipped at crazy angles, their bark torn from their trunks. This was the work of ice, said Joe, carried down on a river vastly swollen by the thaw and shredding any obstacle in its path. Distant spruce trees marked the site of our camp, their dark knobbly tops looking like the spires of a medieval cathedral. We pulled out on to a sandy beach from where we watched the sunset as we ate salmon and trapper's bread. Only the black flies, which plagued us briefly as an evening calm descended, marred an otherwise perfect spot. A side trip up a stream to visit a beaver lodge left only a couple of hours paddling before the end of our voyage just above Muskrat Falls. Here the twisting, coiling water of the river was transformed into a roaring fury of foam. Joe picked up the 70lb canoe, swung it easily on to his shoulders, and carried it up the steep path which marked the portage route the trappers used to avoid the falls. To them it was just a brief interruption in their long journey along this river road. Canadian Tourist Office Information: 071 - 839 2299.

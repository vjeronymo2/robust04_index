Upon his arrival here this evening, Qiao said that over the  past two years, especially after German Chancellor Helmut Kohl  visited China last November, the relations between the two  countries have entered a new stage and bilateral economic  relations and trade developed rapidly.    "I have come to Germany for an official and goodwill visit  under such a situation," he added.    He was sure that his current visit will achieve good results  and help push forward bilateral ties.    Hans Klein, vice president of the Federal Assembly of  Germany, who greeted Qiao at the airport, said Germany attaches  great importance to its relationship with the Asian countries.    Germany particularly values its ties with China, a big  country with a population of more than one billion, he said.    Klein noted the rapid development of the relations between  the two governments, saying that Qiao's visit to Germany  symbolized the beginning of the high-level contacts between the  parliaments of the two countries.    Qiao arrived in Berlin on January 16 to start his German  visit. He came to Bonn from Hamburg to meet his German  counterpart Rita Suessniuth and other Parliament leaders.</p>

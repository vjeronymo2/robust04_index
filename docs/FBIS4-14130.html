			<p>BFN     [Text] AL-SHA'B has learned that Israel has prepared a plan  to assassinate Hamas leaders in response to the hostile  operations Hamas mujahidin have carried out inside the occupied  territories that have killed and wounded scores of Israelis  during the past two weeks.    The Israeli security services, military intelligence, and  Mosad last week approved the final plan, which consists of  several phases. The first phase envisages the assassination of  200 Hamas leaders while the second phase envisages the  assassination of 400 leaders. The assassination operations will  target Hamas leaders in Britain, Jordan, Sudan, Lebanon and  other countries. New methods will be used in these operations.    The Israeli military intelligence service has agreed to  finance a number of Jewish terrorist organizations that will  carry out these operations.    Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has approved the plan.  The Israeli Foreign Ministry has asked its embassies abroad to  gather the necessary information to carry out the  assassinations. The Israeli Embassy in Cairo has been asked to  gather information on the movements of Hamas leaders in  neighboring Arab countries.</p>

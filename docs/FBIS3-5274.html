He  said the request was welcome, although long overdue. If  implemented it would definitely improve bilateral ties. The  Supreme Command has asked police to issue arrest warrants for  Vang Pao and Gen Thonglit Chokbengboun, reputed leaders of the  anti-communist Hmong guerrillas, and also requested that the  United States consider taking legal action against them.    Vang Pao spent two years along the Thai-Lao border after the  1975 defeat of the US-backed guerrillas by troops of the  communist government in Laos.    The general then went to live in the United States and took  up American citizenship but is reported to have returned  frequently to Thailand.    The Supreme Command said issuing warrents would allow  authorities to act against the two men immediately if the return  again.    "It would be much appreciated if Thailand acted on the  Supreme Command request for police to arrest General Vang Pao  and General Thonglit Chokbengboun for allegedly violating Thai  security laws," said Bounteng.    "Thailand should have (issued warrants) a long time ago. We  will keep watching to see if Thailand acts in accordance with  the request," he said.    Bounteng said that following up with strong action against  rebels hiding out in Thailand would be a clear reflection of the  strong feeling of co-operation and unity between the two  countries, which have a long common border and close cultural  and languages ties.    "lssuing arrest warrants for Vang Pao and Thonglit would be  an explicit affirmation by Thailand of its foreign policy of not  allowing any group to use its territory as a base to launch  attacks on neighbouring countries," he said.    Bounteng believes that hundreds of Hmong living in Wat Tham  Krabok drug treatment centre in Saraburi Province are members of  Vang Pao's anti-Vientiane forces.    "The Thai government should be aware that the Hmongs in the  drug treatment centre are not all drug addicts," he said.    The temple has a reputation for rehabilitating drug addicts  from Thailand and other countries. The number of Hmongs  entering the country without permission, reputedly to receive  treatment, has increased in recent years.    National Security Council chief Gen Charan Kunlawanit has  said the Hmongs illegally living in the temple should be  repatriated to Laos.    Bounteng said Laos would welcome them back if they were  prepared to work for the country's development.    The Laotian people would help authorities keep a close watch  on the returnees and report them if they showed any intention of  disrupting the government or the country.    "When the late Kaysone Phomvihan was asked several years ago  about the number of people in Laos and the number of police, he  answered that they are the same, about 3.5 million at that  time," the minister said.</p>

			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Survey of French Finance and Investment (6): Rekindling the public's interest - It is hoped that the stockmarket will benefit from privatisation with an increase in equity investment IN THE unveiling of his privatisation plans, Edmond Alphandery, the French economy minister, made clear that his government saw the share sales not only as a means of raising capital, but also as a chance to raise the level of investment in the Paris stockmarket. The market has long been waiting for such an initiative. The last real boost for French equities was the centre-right government's privatisation drive in 1986 and 1987, which drew international investors into the Paris market and encouraged the French public to switch some of their savings into equities. International investors have continued to plough their money into France, but the October 1987 stockmarket crash brought the French public's new found interest in share ownership to an abrupt halt. The current round of privatisations offers an ideal opportunity to try to rekindle the public's interest. The privatisations could not have come at a better time from the stockmarket's perspective. The French financial sector was transformed in the late 1980s by a sweeping deregulation programme in which old monopolies were abolished, closed markets opened and the Matif, now one of the world's largest futures markets, was launched. However the stockmarket's progress has since been impeded by the survival of old anachronisms such as the impot de bourse, the tax on share transactions, and the strict rules on block trading, which have prompted many traders to execute larger deals in London rather than Paris. Edouard Balladur's government, like that of the late Pierre Beregovoy, his socialist predecessor, has tried to address these difficulties with mixed success. Meanwhile the overwheening issue facing the Paris stockmarket is its relatively low level of liquidity - the legacy of a dearth of equity and of capital. The equity shortage is due partly to the nepotistic structure of the French corporate sector whereby many large companies, including Michelin and L'Oreal, are still controlled by their founding families. The other groups have negotiated so many cross-shareholdings and 'sweetheart' deals that they are not only virtually bid-proof, but only a small proportion of their shares are actually traded. Another contributor to the equity problem is the power of the state, which still controls many of France's largest companies. The Balladur privatisations represent a powerful, if partial, solution by unleashing around FFr45bn of new shares on to the stockmarket this year and at least FFr55bn next year. 'Liquidity has been a problem for the Paris market, but the situation is getting better,' said David Harrington, French market analyst at James Capel in Paris. 'The privatisations should help and we have also seen a great deal of private sector activity this year with convertible bond and warrant issues. By the end of 1993 the Paris market will have been tapped for up to FFr70bn.' Privatisation should also help to assuage the other side of the liquidity problem: the shortage of capital caused by the traditional ambivalence of the French towards equity investment and the state's stranglehold over the pensions system, which means that Paris, unlike London and New York, can not count on an influx of investment from private pension funds. The forthcoming reform of French pensions, which is likely to involve the creation of private pension funds, should provide a long-term solution to this problem. But in the meantime the privatisations should at least bring in a short-term flow of capital from foreign institutions and the French public. The increase in foreign investment was one of the main achievements of France's last privatisation drive. The 1986 and 1987 share sales provided an opening for international investors into the Paris market and the proportion of French equities in foreign hands has since increased steadily, rising from 21 per cent to 28 per cent in the last two years alone, according to the Bank of France. So far the present privatisation plan seems set to bring yet more foreign capital into France. The government was forced after just two days to close the institutional part of its first privatisation, the Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP) share sale, because of strong demand, particularly from US investors. These investors were undoubtedly attracted by the unexpectedly low price of the BNP shares. The strong dollar was an additional incentive for US investors, as was the strong yen for the Japanese. However, analysts have also detected an underlying increase in interest in the Paris market. 'This is a great time to buy French shares,' said Thierry Tamers, head of North American sales at Baring Securities in Paris. 'The economy is probably at the bottom of the cycle and many of the privatisation candidates, like BNP, are recovery stocks.' The successful outcome of the public part of the BNP issue also boded well for the government's prospects of persuading the French public to participate in the privatisations. The French responded well to the mid-1980s privatisations - when 11 per cent of the population bought FFr40bn, or almost a third, of the available shares - but the 1987 crash dashed the government's hopes of boosting share ownership. The number of private investors has since fallen from 5.5m to less than 4.5m. The Balladur government hopes to reverse this trend. This summer's FFr110bn 'Balladur bond' issue was cleverly designed as a bridge to persuade the French to switch their savings, first into government bonds, and then into privatisation shares. Recent reductions in interest rates, coupled with the prospect of further cuts, should make equities seem increasingly attractive in comparison with the dwindling returns on cash investments. 'Everything is conspiring to make the equity market look very attractive against cash - a savings glut, low inflation and falling interest rates,' said James Capel's Mr Harrington. 'We're still waiting to see a flow of funds from cash into shares in France. The privatisation programme may be exactly what investors have been waiting for.'</p>

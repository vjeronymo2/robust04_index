			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Letter: U-turns may be sensible option Sir, One's admiration for FT contributors is somewhat dimmed by their continued preoccupation with government U-turns. Plans for present and future action by people and governments are always made in the light of the information available at the time. If, after plans are made, new information suggests that those plans are wrong, sensible people and governments change them. The present government has had to make many changes in policy recently for that reason. The government's sources of information have been extremely poor and they can be faulted for not addressing the problem sooner. However, if they turn a corner and face a brick wall which is not on their map, is it right to rebuke them for making a U-turn? The FT is in the information business itself and it should be concentrating on this aspect of government incompetence and helping where possible for the good of the nation.

			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / UK Company News: Merlin cuts deficit to Pounds 652,000 MERLIN International Properties made further progress in eliminating trading losses in the six months to December 31. At the pre-tax level losses fell to Pounds 652,000, against Pounds 2.69m. The outcome was achieved on turnover of Pounds 1.86m (Pounds 1.58m). Net exceptional costs increased from Pounds 61,000 to Pounds 390,000 - which represented the full cost of defending the compulsory purchase order on the group's Manchester project. Mr Peter Jevans, chairman, said there was evidence that market conditions had ceased to worsen. The company's attempts to achieve a financial restructuring and a relisting had, as yet, borne no fruit, Mr Jevans said, but the directors were confident of achieving a satisfactory end to this stalemate.</p>

Before the meeting, Qian told reporters at the Chinese  Embassy that this would be the first meeting between himself and  the U.S. secretary of state since the beginning of this year.  Last year, he added, they had met three times.    He went on to explain that the two would review the progress  achieved since the meeting between Chinese President Jiang Zemin  and U.S. President Bill Clinton in Seattle last November.    He said: "Thanks to the common efforts, U.S. Secretary of  Treasury Lloyd Bentsen paid an official visit to China this  month and in the meantime the 8th meeting of the Sino-U.S. Joint  Economic Committee was held." The foreign minister added that  the two sides have also been busy with the preparations for the  meeting of the Science and Technology Joint Committee and the  meeting of Commerce and Trade Joint Committee.    Recently, China and the U.S. reached an agreement on textile  trade. All these developments are quite encouraging, the  Chinese vice premier stressed.    He expressed hope that his Paris meeting with the U.S.  secretary of state could further help improve and develop the  bilateral ties.    Warren Christopher told reporters that he was quite pleased  to meet Qian Qichen here. He said that they would exchange  views on the improvement of bilateral ties, as well as issues of  mutual concern so as to deepen the relations between the two  countries.</p>

Booker scored three touchdowns last season against  Marshall.  </P> <P> The Lancers' quickest touchdown came when Marlowe Lewis returned a blocked  field-goal attempt 69 yards to give Grant a 14-7 lead with 1:22 left in the  first half. The longest scoring drive, which came after the opening kickoff,  took 10 minutes, 6 seconds. Grant moved 75 yards in 18 plays, Lewis scoring on  a seven-yard quarterback option. Lewis was the leading rusher with 61 yards in  11 carries. He also completed three of nine passes for 66 yards.  </P> <P> Grant completed the scoring on a drive that consumed nearly seven minutes in  the third quarter with Marcel Desir scoring on a one-yard run.  </P> <P> Marshall (0-2) took 13 seconds to tie the score after Marlowe's keeper when  Danny Altruz returned the ensuing kickoff 81 yards. Altruz had 181 yards in  return yardage.  </P> <P> The Lancers were penalized 16 times for 122 yards. SEAN WATERS  </P></p>

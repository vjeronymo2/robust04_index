			<p>BFN     [Text] Malaysia may dispatch more sophisticated weapons to  its troops if the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina is worsening  and endangering the lives of Malbatt [Malaysian battalion]  members. Defense Minister Datuk Sri Najib Tun Razak said the  dispatch of the weapons will, however, be implemented after the  UN approval. Presently, the weapons used by Malbatt members are  meant only for self-defense and not for combat purposes.  However, if the situation changes for the worse, the government  will not hesitate to send more sophisticated weapons to its  troops in Bosnia. He also criticized the Serbs for detaining 18  UN peacekeeping troops in an area not far from Sarajevo on  Thursday [14 April].    Speaking after he attended a ceremony to present literary  awards in Kuala Lumpur, the minister said even though Malbatt  members risk their lives in Bosnia, they are fearless in  carrying out their duty. He added that Malbatt members will  continue to serve in Bosnia under the UN peacekeeping banner  because local people welcome their presence. He stressed that  even though Malaysia is unhappy with the UN stand against the  Serbs, it hopes that the world community will not bow to the  Serbian demands.</p>

			<p>940411 FT  11 APR 94 / Skeleton in Hosokawa's cupboard may be a dummy The past few days have provided tragi-comic proof that nothing is quite what it seems in Japanese politics. The skeleton that prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa found in his cupboard, startling him badly enough to resign, appears, by his own account, to be a dummy. Suspicions over his personal finances were 'just a trick', Mr Hosokawa told fellow members of the Japan New Party on Saturday, according to the Asahi Shimbun, the left-leaning daily newspaper. The real reason for giving up the prime ministership was to break up the opposition Liberal Democratic Party, he was reported to have said. The Asahi offered no explanation of this baffling news. Yet it should be believed. The Asahi must be a reliable newspaper, because Mr Hosokawa started his career as a journalist there before going into politics. All this is, however, in keeping with the quirky events leading up to Mr Hosokawa's announcement last Friday. At dinner with two professional comedians-turned-politicians early in the week, he joked that he wanted to stand down. He denied he said it a few hours later, and then really did say it at a cabinet meeting. Not surprisingly, Japanese newspapers were buzzing with speculation over the weekend about exactly what prompted Mr Hosokawa's final U-turn. Mr Hosokawa indicated, tantalisingly, that he uncovered irregularities in investments made on his behalf in the early 1980s by a close friend. This, he hinted, went deeper than the LDP's two accusations of accepting an improper political loan from Sagawa Kyubin, a trucking firm, and trying to cover up a share transaction, both of which Mr Hosokawa denies. The explanations offered by the Japanese media are bewilderingly various. NHK television claimed that Mr Hosokawa invested Y80m (Pounds 524,000) unwittingly, with a loan shark, contravening a law against usury. Another version, provided by the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper, is that Mr Hosokawa's friend, an investment consultant and company president, offered to obtain a guaranteed 12 per cent annual return on Mr Hosokawa's behalf to help him raise the cash needed to form an LDP faction. They met in 1980, according to the Mainichi, when Mr Hosokawa was a member of the upper house of parliament and the friend became a 'fan'. The problem with the Mainichi's version is that Mr Hosokawa never did form an LDP faction. He did in 1992 leave the LDP to form a party, the Japan New party, dedicated, among other things, to breaking the cosy, often corrupt, links between business and politics. The potential legal problem is in any case too trivial to warrant resignation. At worst, the friend might not have had a licence as investment manager. But the law on investment managers has a three-year statute of limitations - and all this was supposed to have happened at least 10 years ago. Yet another version, supplied by the Japan Times, is that Mr Hosokawa's fund manager, the publisher of a monthly economic magazine, invested around Y60m, derived from the sale of land that Mr Hosokawa inherited from his grandfather, former prime minister Prince Fumimaro Konoe. The investment performed badly, and was worth only Y10m by 1991, claimed the Japan Times. Mr Hosokawa was said to have been introduced to this friend by his own private secretary, Mr Masatoshi Miyama, who left Mr Hosokawa's employ under a cloud in 1991. The prime minister has refused LDP demands to allow his former secretary to be questioned in parliament. Speculation is rife that Mr Miyama knows what dark secret it really was that prompted Mr Hosokawa to resign. On the other hand, there is a school of political gossips who prefer the simple alibi - that Mr Hosokawa had simply lost patience with the aggressive LDP's attempts to wreck his clean image.</p>

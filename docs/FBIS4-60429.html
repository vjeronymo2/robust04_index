			<p>BFN     [Text] Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid, chairman of the  Presidential Council and secretary general of the Yemeni  Socialist Party, has stressed that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih imposed  an unjust war on us, and secession on the entire Yemeni people  on 27 April 1994, when he declared war on everyone. He said  that we found ourselves compelled, in overwhelming  circumstances, to announce the formation of the Democratic  Republic of Yemen, which we consider to be the nucleus for a  unified Yemen, as it was erected on the firm basis of the pledge  and accord document, a document for national consensus. The  brother chairman of the Presidential Council stated this today  during a dawn press conference in al-Mukalla, Hadramawt  Governorate, during which he touched on a number of important  national issues.    Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid said that the situation which the  military and dictatorial machine of the al-Ahmar family's gang  is trying to impose would not gain a foothold in this  governorate. He noted that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih was trying,  with his forces deployed over a wide area, to turn the situation  in his favor, and to besiege Aden, but he had paid a dear price  and was continuing to do so. The brother said: It is now up to  us to step up resistance, together with all patriots and  democrats in the northern governorates, to bring about the  collapse of the al-Ahmar gang's military machine, and with it  the collapse of its [word indistinct] and hegemony over Yemen's  resources and people.    He stressed that the reconstruction of the state in part of  Yemen's territory places before us a great task for the future,  and a historic responsibility to struggle to bring about the  unity of the Yemeni homeland and people. He said: We are not  afraid of being termed secessionists or unionists, because  history will describe us as individuals seeking to bring about  realistic circumstances for the performance of democratic,  unionist, and peaceful actions for the future of the entire  Yemeni people.</p>

The large privatization amendment which is to be dealt with  by the parliament on Wednesday is neither the governmental nor  opposition draft, he said. The two parties are in accord on  everything except the personal union of a government member with  the FNM. We are willing to make concessions, such as the  finance minister not needing to be director of the FNM Board of  Supervisors, he added.    If the government is to implement an economic policy, it  must  have money, and this is in the Fund, Meciar stated. The  government provides companies with guarantees, and as more than  half of the budget is based on these guarantees, the personal  union between the government and the FNM is indispensable, he  said.    The companies managed by the FNM owe some 2 billion Slovak  crowns ($60.6 million) for taxes, Meciar said.    The struggle for personal union is no power struggle, it is  a  struggle for the efficient linkage and workability of the  system, he added.    Wednesday's voting on the large privatization amendment will  not be connected with a no confidence vote in the government,  Meciar said. If the parliament passes a law which does not suit  the government, the latter will return it in accordance with the  Constitution through President Michal Kovac to the parliament,  he concluded.</p>

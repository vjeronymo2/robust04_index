The AVF said it supported the Inkatha Freedom Party's  rejection of the peace plan, which entailed the withdrawal of  the SA Police's Internal Stability Division [ISD] from East Rand  townships.    AVF Press Secretary Stephen Maninger said the composition of  SA Defence Force [SADF] units which would replace the ISD would  be advantageous to the African National Congress. There had  been past complaints that black troops, which comprised the  majority of the SADF's permanent force, openly chanted pro-ANC  slogans and often insulted IFP supporters by referring to IFP  President Mangosuthu Buthelezi as a dog.    The implementation of the East Rand peace plan could lead to  the ANC implementing ethnic cleansing in townships, he said.  The so-called ensuing peace would not result in an absence of  violence but of ANC opponents, Mr Maninger said.    State President F. W. de Klerk's acceptance of the peace  plan  was not surprising, because he had decided to no longer oppose  ANC decisions. The norm was that President de Klerk yielded to  ANC pressure, Mr Maninger said.</p>

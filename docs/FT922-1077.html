			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / US to tighten sanctions on Belgrade government THE US yesterday issued its toughest condemnation of the 'barbaric' killing of civilians in Bosnia by Serbian militias and announced that it was tightening sanctions against the Belgrade government. United Nations officials in Sarajevo said they had given up hope of quickly securing a 48-hour ceasefire to airlift supplies after the Bosnian capital had been bombarded for most of the day. Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, did not discount US support for a multilateral operation. 'The US has not ruled out participating in some multilateral operation if that should become necessary, particularly with respect to the provisioning of humanitarian assistance.' He said the US would: Immediately withdraw recognition from Belgrade's ambassador to the US; Order the former Yugoslav consulate in Chicago to be closed; Consult its allies on additional steps, including action to end the obstruction of UN relief operations in Sarajevo; Broaden its efforts to have Serbia and its ally Montenegro suspended from participating in international institutions; Press for the two former Yugoslav republics to be required to reapply for membership once they had complied with UN Security Council resolutions and met criteria set for the admission of other new states. Describing the latest mortar attacks by Serb militia forces on the centre of Sarajevo as 'barbaric' and 'inhuman', Mr Baker said the time had come for the international community to go beyond economic sanctions, which the UN imposed on Serbia and Montenegro at the beginning of this month. 'It's hard to believe, really, in this day and age, that armed forces will fire artillery and mortars indiscriminately into the heart of a city, flushing defenceless men, women and children out into the streets and then shooting them,' Mr Baker told a hearing of the US Senate committee on foreign relations. In Sarajevo, General Lewis Mackenzie, head of the UN mission, said: 'Any immediate hope of establishing a two-day truce to reopen the city airport is over.' Continued shelling, sniper attacks and anti-aircraft fire by Serb irregulars could prevent Bosnian president Alija Izetbegovic from travelling to Strasbourg where Lord Carrington, chairman of the European-Community sponsored peace conference, intends to reconvene the conference tomorrow. Mr Haris Silajdzic, the Bosnian foreign minister, is expected to attend the conference as is Croatian president Franjo Tudjman, and Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic. In Prishtina, capital of Kosovo, Serbian authorities yesterday prevented the independent parliament from meeting by surrounding the building with tanks and troops, and arresting several of its supporters and deputies. Heavily armed Serb troops set up roadblocks around the premises, and occupied the building. The parliament was due to hold its first inaugural session following underground elections last month organised by the Democratic League of Kosovo (DLK), the ethnic-Albanian party. Serbia, under President Slobodan Milosevic, who forcibly integrated the southern province of Kosovo into the republic, said the elections were illegal. Mr Ibrahim Rugova, who was elected president of Kosovo last month, said the DLK was determined to set up its own parliament and structures independent of Serbia.</p>

			<p><P> November 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SMALL BUSINESS / JANE APPLEGATE: HOME NURSING FIRMS TACKLE AIDS CHALLENGES  </P> <P> Four years ago, David Kessler, a registered nurse, tried to interest the home  health-care companies for which he was working to establish a special group of  nurses devoted to helping patients with AIDS.  </P> <P> When his supervisors scoffed at the idea, he founded his own company,  Progressive Nursing Services in West Hollywood.  </P> <P> "I created this company from a nurse's viewpoint," said Kessler, who treated  his first AIDS patient in 1983.  </P> <P> Progressive Nursing is one of a handful of Southern California small businesses  dedicated to treating AIDS patients at home. Together, the companies are  providing care for many of the 7,993 AIDS patients in Los Angeles County and  hundreds more in adjacent areas.  </P> <P> Company executives say their greatest challenges are finding competent,  compassionate nurses to meet the demand and pressing the state and private  insurance companies to reimburse them in a timely manner.  </P> <P> Their businesses are thriving for two reasons. The primary one is that most  AIDS patients prefer to remain at home with friends and relatives if at all  possible. Staying home also makes financial sense. A week in the hospital for a  seriously ill AIDS patient can cost up to $15,000, compared to $700 to $800 a  week if visiting nurses can provide the same care at home.  </P> <P> The growth of home nursing firms has been fueled by new technologies and  portable medical equipment. Treatments once limited to hospital settings, such  as intravenous antibiotics and liquid nutrition, can now be administered safely  at home.  </P> <P> Companies providing home care for AIDS patients and those considering a move  into the field recently received an incentive from the state of California.  Starting this month, California's medical insurance program, Medi-Cal, will pay  for certain home health-care services for AIDS patients.  </P> <P> "The state will pay for attendants, nurses and some housing renovation costs  for things such as wheelchair ramps and grab bars," said Rob Peterson, program  manager for the AIDS Project L.A.'s community health pilot project.  </P> <P> He said there are limits on the coverage, but it is an important first step  toward better home care for Medi-Cal patients with AIDS.  </P> <P> Peterson is familiar with local health-care companies because he is supervising  a three-year, state-sponsored study comparing the cost of home care to hospital  care for AIDS patients.  </P> <P> "There is always room for more companies to treat AIDS patients," said  Peterson. "I wish there were more nurses, too. The ones who are doing it are  very dedicated and thorough, but the burnout rate is quite high."  </P> <P> Founders of the companies treating AIDS patients at home said they started  their own businesses because they were unhappy with the way their employers  were doing the job.  </P> <P> "Our founders were nurses who worked for another company," said Renee  Ryan-Johnson, director of nursing for Comprehensive Nursing Services in Los  Angeles. "They were quite dissatisfied and unhappy with the service given to  AIDS patients."  </P> <P> Ryan-Johnson said companies providing AIDS care are different than most nursing  registries because they must be very involved in managing insurance benefits  and acting as a patient advocate. She said most insurance policies are "just  not suited to the kind of care AIDS patients need." By working closely with  insurance providers, Ryan-Johnson said comprehensive has "conserved a lot of  insurance dollars for patients wanting to be treated at home."  </P> <P> Integrated Care Systems opened in March, 1988, and has seven offices around the  state. About half of its patients have AIDS, according to Bruce Borggreve,  president.  </P> <P> "We look at ourselves as a complete care company," said Borggreve. "We provide  a composite of services surrounding the IV (intravenous) patient."  </P> <P> Integrated Care Systems, with its 175 employees around the state, is a  subsidiary of a publicly held health-care company in Boston. Borggreve, who  formerly worked for American Hospital Supply Co. and Caremark, said his  greatest challenges are recruiting good staff members and dealing with  Medi-Cal.  </P> <P> "An inexperienced company should approach it cautiously if they are trying to  build a new business around AIDS," said Borggreve. "You've got to be here  tomorrow to continue the service."  </P> <P> David Kessler, the former actor now considered a pioneer in AIDS care, said he  thought AIDS would be a short-lived malady like Legionnaire's disease.  </P> <P> Instead, the need for the specialized care Progressive Nursing provides has  soared and Kessler finds himself at the helm of a company that has doubled in  size in the past four years.  </P> <P> "It's been hard for me to deal with the business side," admits Kessler, who  hired a business manager early on to help him with the nuts and bolts of  running a company.  </P> <P> In recent years, he has learned to delegate more and more responsibility to his  22 staff members. And he has joined a group of top executives who meet  regularly to discuss common problems.  </P> <P> This year, he expects sales to exceed $3 million. He said he is talking with  hospital executives who are interested in setting up a joint venture with  Progressive to treat patients.  </P> <P> "I never set out to start a business," he said. "It really kind of happened out  of the blue."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Caltech/MIT Forum Seeks Tech Firms  </P> <P> The Caltech/MIT Enterprise Forum is seeking technology companies interested in  presenting their business plans to a panel of experts and an audience of  entrepreneurs. The Forum, beginning its sixth year, attracted more than 300  people to a recent session at Caltech. Participants are being sought for two  programs. One program is for growing companies with sales between $1 million  and $20 million. The other program is designed for technology start-ups of any  size.

			<p><P> July 28, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> FORMER COACH DENIES HE KNEW OF INELIGIBILITY  </P> <P> A former Howard University football coach at the center of a growing scandal  over players who apparently played after their four-year college eligibility  had expired has said he never intentionally used ineligible players.  </P> <P> As many as one-third of the players on the Howard team have been told they have  one less year of eligibility than originally thought going into the 1989  season, school officials have said.  </P> <P> The eligibility foul-up apparently affects about 30 players recruited for the  Bison under former coach Willie Jeffries, Howard deputy counsel Francis Smith  said Thursday.  </P> <P> Jeffries, contacted Thursday, said he was told he was told three players Howard  attorneys have asked him about were eligible.  </P> <P> "The records we were shown indicated they had not played before" 1984, he said.  </P> <P> When he went to Washington in mid-June to give a deposition to Howard  attorneys, "they asked me about the three players and the financial aid  irregularities," he said from his Orangeburg, S.C., office.  </P> <P> "The records we were shown indicated they had not played before. We thought  they were redshirt freshmen. To our knowledge they only played four years. They  said they had not played in 1983."  </P> <P> The school has said it is investigating irregularities in the Bison football  program under Jeffries over four years.  </P></p>

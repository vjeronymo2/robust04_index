			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Attwoods advance to Pounds 15.5m checked by US operations ATTWOODS, the waste management company, yesterday reported an 11.6 per cent increase in profits to Pounds 15.5m, but was held back by its US metal recycling business. Pre-tax profits in the six months to end-January rose from Pounds 13.9m to Pounds 15.5m, using the new FRS 3 and Fred 3 accounting principles, on sales up 16 per cent at Pounds 195.3m. Earnings per share fell from 4.36p to 3.7p, after last year's dilutive debt-reducing rights issue. The interim dividend is maintained at 1.75p. Mr Ken Foreman, chairman, said he was 'overall cautiously optimistic for the year'. The main hit at the operating level came in the US from Mindis, the metal recycling business. The company, which is largely dependent on world metal prices, swung from an operating profit of Pounds 900,000 to a loss of Pounds 2.8m on sales of Dollars 54m (Pounds 38m) in the first half. Profits would have been flat without the benefit of exchange translations from the dollar and D-Mark. Exchange translation also affected net borrowings, with net debt up Pounds 50.6m from the year-end at Pounds 125.9m. This gave gearing of 52.2 per cent, up from 36.4 per cent. Interest cover fell to 10 times. At constant exchange rates, debt would have risen by Pounds 25m, in line with Attwoods' expectations. Operationally, the Florida waste operation performed well and reaped a net gain from the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew. In continental Europe, an anticipated reduction in margins from the planned expansion of the waste management division, was worse than expected due to the downturn in the German economy. Germany accounted for 16 per cent of group sales and was less likely to suffer from the economic downturn as much of its business was related to construction and environmental services in the eastern part of the country, the company said.</p>

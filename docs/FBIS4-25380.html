			<p>BFN     [Text] Guangzhou, June 3 (CNS) -- The Guangzhou General  Petrochemical Plant, which was listed as a processing base of a  capacity of 10 million tonnes for imported sulphur bearing crude  oil, is now under preparations for an expansion which was  expected to come to completion by the end of this century, said  the director of the plant Mr. Hong Zhiming in an interview with  this agency.    The plant set up in the early 1970s was listed as the state  key enterprise during the Seventh Five Year Plan period and was  expanded in a large-scale. It was now equipped with  installation for intensive processing of heavy oil. The plant  took the lead in carrying out the processing of imported oil and  refined nine kinds of domestic crude oil and 18 kinds of foreign  crude oil. The capability of crude oil processing was up to 5.2  million tonnes a year, making the plant an extraordinary large  enterprise in South China.    After development of the plant into a refinery of a capacity  of 10 million tonnes, according to the director, it would be  able to exploit its potential for better production based on the  original equipment and work force. It was expected that the  spending on the expansion would be valued at US$1 billion, a 30  percent cut of expense needed for construction of a new refinery  of the same size. [as received] Shortage of capital could be  settled by means of the shareholding practice and, with an  effort, better economic results could be achieved.    Following the expansion, Mr. Hong said, the plant would be  able to produce high-quality petrol, diesel oil and kerosene for  aviation, all of which contain no lead. The products would be  exported to Hong Kong, Singapore and Southeast Asia in addition  to domestic sales. It would also be able to provide raw  materials for further development of companies in the  municipality in the future.    Supplementary projects for the expansion ofthe plant include  a crude oil wharf of a capacity of 150 000 tonnes in Daya Bay in  Huizhou, seabed pipelines measuring a total length of 9.7  kilometres, petroleum pipelines of 180 kilometres long and  storage facilities. Construction on these projects would start  by the end of this month.</p>

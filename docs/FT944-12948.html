			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Picking the right pension - Personal plans should be a last resort The Securities and Investments Board (SIB), the finance industry's chief regulator, explained this week how employees with personal pensions would be compensated if their plan was sold on the basis of bad advice (see page III). But while it stressed there was nothing wrong intrinsically with personal pensions as a product, you should remember that these plans were introduced for the self-employed and for staff without access to a company scheme. They were never intended to replace company pension arrangements. The following guide could help you choose the right pension for your circumstances. Q: Should I leave my company scheme for a personal pension? No. If you are in, or have access to, a company scheme that links the value of the pension to your final salary, offers death-in-service benefits and disability pensions, then you should stay put. If the pension is not salary-linked, check exactly what you get for your contributions. Q: What about senior executives? In certain cases, a senior executive who has built up a substantial fund could gain more flexibility over the pension income, and the investment of the fund in retirement, if he switches to a personal plan. But this is a complex area and professional, independent advice must be sought. Q: I have changed jobs. Should I transfer my former company scheme benefits to a personal pension? Probably not. In most cases, your pension will be worth more if you leave it with your former employer. This is called a 'deferred' pension because payment is deferred or postponed until you retire. Remember that any transfer costs money, except where employees change jobs within the public sector. If, for some reason, it is necessary to take your pension out of the old scheme, then consider transferring it to your new employer's scheme if you can. A personal plan should be regarded as a last resort. By law, advisers and salesmen must compare all these options before making a recommendation. Q: I have been made redundant. Do I need to transfer my pension? No. Do nothing in the short term unless you are forced to act - for example, where the employer is insolvent. Even then, it could take time for the trustees or liquidators to establish the value of your pension. Where the employer still exists, the newly-redundant should leave their pensions in the old scheme at least until all the options are known. Your next employer might offer an excellent pension and it could be best to transfer to this scheme. Q: There is no company scheme so I want a personal pension. For future contributions, this might be the only option. But do seek independent advice, preferably on a fee basis, and do not transfer benefits from old schemes just for the sake of neatness. Your adviser should explain the personal pension provider's charges and the amount of commission, if any, that he gets. He should also consider the financial strength of the provider and the performance and flexibility of the plan. You should, for example, be able to reduce and stop contributions and/or retire early without penalty. Q. There is a company scheme but I may change jobs after a few years. Some careers lead to frequent job changes and periods of self-employment, so it is important to ask the pension manager or trade union what will happen to your company pension if you leave. Provided you expect to stay for more than two years, the company scheme is likely to be best, particularly if it offers good family protection benefits if you die. If you do want a personal plan to take with you from job to job, choose with care and make sure the plan is genuinely portable (see above). Q. What if I want to retire early or my employer has a habit of enforcing early retirement? You should still join the company scheme. If you face early retirement, you should top up your pension by paying additional voluntary contributions (AVCs), provided by the company scheme, or take out a free-standing AVC (FSAVC) plan sold by life offices and a few unit trust groups. Company AVCs offer better value because the employer bears all or most of the charges, but FSAVCs can offer a wider investment choice. If you are interested in FSAVCs, seek independent advice. Where to get advice. If you are not sure what benefits are provided in your company scheme, contact the pensions manager or your trade union. SIB publishes two fact sheets on opting out and transferring benefits out of an employer's scheme.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Rabeh Kebir, official spokesman of the </F> Algerian Islamic Salvation Front, FIS, by Salim Badawi; from  "The Event" program ; date and place not given--recorded]    [Excerpts] [Badawi] The national dialogue conference was  held on time but its success was not certain. Its failure was  expected by major Algerian parties and forces, especially the  FIS, whose spokesman abroad, Rabeh Kebir, says that since the  dialogue has failed, a serious, deep-rooted solution must be  sought. This should begin by releasing all detainees and  entering serious negotiations with the FIS preparatory to  handing over power to the real representative of the Algerian  people. Here is Rabeh Kebir:    [Kebir] The failure of the dialogue committee was expected.  We were not surprised. Everybody knows the FIS won the  elections, in addition to other two parties, the National  Liberation Front and the Socialist Forces Party. But since that  time, the putschists have refused to deal seriously with the  winning parties. They tried to create a counter-front against  the FIS. They did not succeed. Then they resorted to lies,  because before and after the dialogue conference there were  rumors that the FIS would participate. The aim was clearly to  confuse the people and pressure the parties.    Now that the dialogue has failed, and its failure was  expected, a deep-rooted, serious solution must be sought. I  believe those in power now cannot go on because the country's  resources are wasted everyday. Their own interests are  threatened in Algeria. They cannot do what they want. I  believe that the wise ones should seek a serious solution. This  begins by releasing all detainees and entering serious  negotiations with the FIS preparatory to handing over power to  the real representative of the Algerian people.    [Badawi] Do you consider the failure of the national  dialogue  conference to be a victory for the FIS?    [Kebir] Absolutely. Because the FIS is working in a clear  way and on correct principles, it is moving from one victory to  another despite the fact that it sometimes seems to fall into  troubles, that it has been exposed to injustice. But, I believe  this is only logical in the lives of great movements that demand  deep-rooted changes. [passage omitted]    [Badawi] Concerning the future, you spoke of the need for  deep-rooted changes. How do you view these changes and are you  prepared to share power, first on the legislative level, with  the other political parties and sides in Algeria preparatory to  crystallizing a future picture of the government?    [Kebir] The demands of the FIS have been clear from the  beginning. It was expressed in its charters and in its election  campaign. It wants to build an Islamic state based on Islamic  principles as stipulated in the November statement. This is not  an invention. This is a demand of the early martyrs. Since  this is the demand of the martyrs and mujahdin in November, this  means that those who are present in the political arena...  [pauses] it is supposed to be the demand of everyone. By God,  we will work with those who accept this demand, the demand of  establishing an Algerian state within the framework of Islamic  principles.    [Badawi] Otherwise?    [Kebir] By God, our demands are clear. We cannot concede  this principle.    [Badawi] Does this mean that there is no place for the other  parties that do not call for establishing an Islamic state in  Algeria?    [Kebir] I do not say this. The issue of the establishment of  parties or our (?nonacceptance) is connected with the Algerian  people. The election explained this. We certainly welcome the  parties that were elected by the people. But those who lead the  country, as is known in all world countries, are the party that  gets the majority. The other parties may participate in power  with ministerial portfolios and other things. This is logical  but always within the planning of the majority party. [passage  omitted]</p>

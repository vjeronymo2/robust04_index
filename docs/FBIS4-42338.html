			<p>BFN     [Text] Greece has warned Ankara that its slanderous and  unfounded accusations against Greece cannot coexist with the  appeals for a climate of friendly relations. The accusations  also threaten stability in the region and create serious  questions about Turkey's role and intentions.    Greek Ambassador in Ankara Alexandros Filon conveyed this  strong warning to the Turkish Foreign Ministry during a meeting  with the Turkish deputy foreign minister yesterday. Filon was  reacting to Ankara's accusations about supposed training of PKK  [Workers Party of Kurdistan] guerrillas in Greece.</p>

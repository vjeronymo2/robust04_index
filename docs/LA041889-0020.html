			<p><P> April 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SANDINISTAS DEPORT AMERICAN WHO CRASH-LANDED IN NICARAGUA  </P> <P> The government Monday deported an American who crash-landed his private plane  in Nicaragua last month during what Sandinista officials called a flight to  pick up cocaine in Colombia.  </P> <P> Nicaraguan authorities brought no charges against the pilot, Arthur Henry  Burton Jr., even though his twin-engine Aerocommander entered the country's  airspace illegally March 25 en route from New Orleans.  </P> <P> But they said his deportation showed their eagerness to cooperate with the U.S.  government in regional drug enforcement efforts.  </P> <P> U.S. officials have been cool to that offer, coming as it does from a  Marxist-oriented government that Washington is trying to isolate in Central  America. They had little public comment on the arrest.  </P> <P> Interior Ministry police officers brought Burton, 39, from a Managua prison to  the airport and handed him over to U.S. Consul Atim Ogunba. She gave him his  U.S. passport, which had been seized by the police at the time of his arrest,  and escorted him aboard a direct flight to Miami on Lacsa, the Costa Rican  airline.  </P> <P> A Foreign Ministry official said the U.S. State Department had asked for  Burton's deportation so he could be questioned by the U.S. Customs Service in a  drug-related investigation.  </P> <P> "This is the first time there has been cooperation between the United States  and Nicaragua in a drug case," the official said. "The deportation was an act  of our government, but it was their idea."  </P> <P> American officials declined to comment on talks with the Nicaraguans about the  case or even to confirm that Burton is under U.S. investigation. The U.S.  Embassy spokesman, Lou Falino, said he could not discuss the case because  Burton had not waived his rights under the Privacy Act.  </P> <P> Privately, however, U.S. officials expressed annoyance over the incident,  without denying that Burton is a suspected drug runner.  </P> <P> "The Sandinistas have been pushing for several months to portray themselves as  the white knights of Central America in the war against drugs," one official  said. "They very badly want any kind of understanding with the United States,  and they would say anything to show that they are cooperating with our  government in this area."  </P> <P> At a meeting of five Central American presidents in February, Nicaragua offered  a plan to unify regional anti-drug efforts. It called for centralized  enforcement authority in each of the five countries and monthly regional  meetings to which officials of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration would  be invited.  </P> <P> The five countries' foreign ministers agreed to send delegates to Managua early  this month to discuss the Nicaraguan plan. But the meeting was postponed when  Honduras, a close U.S. ally, advised that its representative could not attend.  </P> <P> Diplomats in the region say that Washington wants to keep the Sandinistas  isolated until they live up to promises for open and fair elections next  February. U.S.-Nicaraguan relations have been minimal since the two countries  expelled one another's ambassadors last July.  </P> <P> Burton and Abimael Castillo Canur, 38, both residents of Belize, landed near  Puerto Cabezas, on Nicaragua's east coast, with a damaged fuel tank. Nicaraguan  officials later gave reporters a confession signed by Burton saying the two  were en route to Capurgana, Colombia, to pick up 200 kilograms of cocaine.  </P></p>

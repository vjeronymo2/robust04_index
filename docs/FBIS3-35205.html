			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary prepared by the News Research and Commentaries </F> Group]    [Text] The crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina has adopted new  international dimensions. The conflict among the United States,  Europe, and Russia over the ultimatum to the Serbs has  overshadowed many political developments.    While Europe continues to have doubts on the implementation  of the recent NATO threats against the Serbs, Russia's protest  against the ultimatum to the Serbs has given Europeans a good  chance to avoid their humanitarian and political responsibility  to deal with the Serbs' crimes. The Russian deputy foreign  minister has said that his country will do its best at the  United Nations to prevent action on this threat, adding that  Russia's goal is to be sure that this threat will never be  implemented and that an attack will never take place.    On the same topic, Russian President Boris Yeltsin has sent  a  letter to the heads of the five Western countries warning of the  dangers that an air strike on the Serbs in Bosnia would entail  and said that this would lead to unforeseeable consequences.  Meanwhile, in a fresh attempt, Russia has proposed an  international peace conference for Bosnia next week and has  informed the heads of the Western countries of this. However,  this proposal has been rejected by Washington and a U.S. State  Department spokesman said that lengthy preparations would be  necessary for that.    At any rate, the recent developments in the Bosnian crisis  and its international consequences show that, basically  speaking, Western and Eastern Europe are very vulnerable in this  crisis and that failures in finding a fundamental solution to  this crisis has posed difficult problems for the behind the  scenes efforts in the crisis.    The West is facing a great crisis of values and  humanitarianism; and pressures from domestic and international  public opinion are constantly increasing. Meanwhile, Russia,  which heretofore influenced the developments in the Bosnian  crisis by backing the Serbs of Bosnia and Serbia, has taken an  active role now that there is a possibility of NATO intervention  against the Serbs and is trying to create a security umbrella  there vis-a-vis the West reminiscent of the Warsaw Pact.  Otherwise, no one takes the NATO threat seriously; not because  NATO is not taking any steps against the Serbs, but because any  possible moves by NATO will not tip the scales in Bosnia in  favor of the Muslims.    Meanwhile, what is causing concern here is that many Western  countries are favoring a military step, or at least a military  threat, so as to decrease the pressures on them by domestic  public opinion and worldwide Islam and to increase pressure on  the Bosnian Muslims to accept a compromise and agree to the  division of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The world of Islam should not be influenced by the political  and propaganda commotion and forget its responsibility vis-a-vis  Bosnia.</p>

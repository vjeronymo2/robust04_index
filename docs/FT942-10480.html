			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Survey of Kenya (4): Indigestion inhibits growth - The private sector is carrying the can for public sector inefficiency After years of complaining that implementation of Kenya's reform programme has been too slow, donors are now warning of 'overload' and 'indigestion'. Overload is the consequence of weak public sector managerial skills on one hand, and pervasive political intervention and obstructionism on the other. After a year in which many of the constraints on the economy  - especially those affecting prices, foreign trade and payments and the financial sector  -have been swept away, Nairobi is now under pressure on two main counts: public sector reform, including parastatal restructuring; and macroeconomic stabilisation. The two are closely interlinked; price and exchange rate stability will be restored only when the budget deficit and credit creation are brought under control. The current macroeconomic policy stance is the now-familiar counter-productive mix of fiscal expansion, partly offset by monetary curbs. As fast as the government pumps liquidity into the system, so the central bank mops it up with treasury bills and increased statutary cash reserves. As a result, the private sector - the obvious engine of growth - is carrying the can for public sector inefficiency. Investment is being constrained by parastatal inefficiency and a weak infrastructure, while government profligacy is crowding out corporate investment, forcing firms to pay higher nominal interest rates. This has to change. In the ambitious policy framework paper (PFP), agreed with the IMF late last year, the government has promised to cut the budget deficit to a targeted 6.1 per cent in 1993-94, from 10.5 per cent last year, with further reductions to 3 per cent in 1994-95 and 2 per cent the year after. When grants are included, the budget should be in balance by 1995-96. Some slippage is inevitable given the difficult political environment and the enormity of the task in the public sector. The signs are that Kenya will overshoot the deficit target by over 1 per cent in the year to June 30, and this could turn out to be optimistic as hitherto unknown public sector spending commitments and borrowings continue coming to light. The 1994-96 PFP targets increasing revenue from 22 per cent of GDP to 24 per cent by 1996. Some maximum tax rates will be lowered, but the tax-base will be broadened by abolishing tax exemption for parastatals, improving revenue collections and expanding VAT to cover services. Government spending is to be reduced from 29 per cent to 26 per cent of GDP by 1995, by eliminating subsidies to the National Cereals and Produce Board, civil service retrenchment, and cuts in security spending and interest charges. The latter looks a forlorn hope at a time when domestic interest charges are absorbing over a third of the budget and foreign payments a further 7 per cent. The civil service is shedding 26,000 jobs - over half of them unfilled posts  -in the current year, reducing its workforce by some 5 per cent to 250,000. A further 48,000 jobs will go over the next three years at the rate of 16,000 annually. Price controls have been virtually eliminated, with one significant exception - fuel prices. These are due to be deregulated by July, though important technical issues relating to the refinery remain to be resolved. Far-reaching reforms are proposed for agriculture, including strengthening research and extension services, the privatisation of some government-provided services such as tractor hire and veterinary services, increased cost recovery, and a new, much-diminished role for the NCPB, to maintain and manage a strategic maize reserve of some 3m 90kg bags. The PFP programme is costed out at Dollars 2.4bn, of which Dollars 800m would come from existing grants and loans, leaving a Dollars 1.6bn gap. The fact that new aid commitments over the 1994-96 period are estimated at only Dollars 300m underscores the changed financing environment that Kenya is now experiencing. No longer can aid be relied upon to close the gap, and Kenya will need 'exceptional financing', including the refinancing of arrears, totalling Dollars 1.3bn over the next three years. The two-year politically-driven donor freeze on balance-of-payments aid, estimated at Dollars 700m, cost Kenya dear. Not only was it partly responsible for the 1992-94 slowdown in the economy, but because foreign interest payments were missed, Nairobi lost its position as one of the select few of African countries that has avoided debt restructuring. Although Kenya secured generous refinancing terms from the Paris Club of official creditors, its external debt burden remains uncomfortable. Interest arrears will be repaid in seven instalments over eight years, with a one-year grace period. Five per cent of the arrears are payable in 1995, rising to 25 per cent in 2001, and negotiations are to be held later with commercial creditors, with a view to obtaining similar terms for Dollars 100m of arrears. In the three years to 1992, Kenya's debt-service ratio averaged 32 per cent of exports; and, while it fell to around 25 per cent last year, when interest was not being paid, and will remain in the mid-20s in 1994-95, the respite will be shortlived. By 1996, debt-service will be absorbing 29 per cent of export and tourism earnings. Debt-service could be less of a burden if last year's impressive balance of payments performance is repeated. Strong export growth, sluggish imports, as business ran down its inventories, the freeze on interest payments, and the return of flight capital as confidence recovered and residents took advantage of high yields in the treasury-bill market, gave rise to healthy surpluses on current, and especially capital, account. Provisional central bank estimates put the current account surplus at Ks7.2bn last year, compared with a deficit of Ks3.6bn in 1992. Healthy growth in tourism and service income more than offset the wider trade gap. Capital inflows, conservatively put at over Ks20bn, pushed the overall surplus to Ks27.5bn, with gross reserves up more than Ks45bn at Ks58bn or seven months' import cover. With aid flows down and almost certain to remain so, export growth and private capital investment from abroad are the keys to a healthy balance of payments. Once import demand starts to recover, as economic growth accelerates and investories are rebuilt, the shilling will come under selling pressure; and, on purchasing power parity and monetary considerations, the recent appreciation of the currency will reverse. Last year's 15 per cent export growth is unlikely to be sustained for long, underlining the need for a new financing strategy, focusing on attracting the private capital necessary for steady growth, from abroad. Exchange rate stability will remain a mirage unless inflation is tackled. The single-digit target by end-1994 is unrealistic, but the rate could be brought below 20 per cent during 1994 if the necessary combination of political will and improved public sector management can be brought to bear.</p>

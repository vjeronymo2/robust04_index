			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 2 KYODO -- The new coalition cabinet of  Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata scored a 62.1 percent support rating  in a joint nationwide telephone survey by the SANKEI SHIMBUN and  Fuji Television network published Monday [2 May].    But nearly 70 percent of the 2,000 respondents called for an  early general election in the wake of the pullout of the Social  Democratic Party (SDP) [Social Democratic Party of Japan --  SDPJ] from the coalition, the SANKEI SHIMBUN said.    The public disapproval rate for the cabinet among the  pollees  was 17.6 percent, the newspaper said.    The public support rating of the Hata cabinet is 21.3  percentage points lower than that of the cabinet of Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, Hata's predecessor, last August, but  is still higher than the rating of previous cabinets of the  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the newspaper said.    The support rate for the cabinet of Prime Minister Noboru  Takeshita on its inauguration in November 1987 was 53 percent  and that for the cabinet of Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa in  November 1991 was 54.9 percent, the SANKEI said.    Of the 62.1 percent backing the Hata cabinet, 29.4 percent  declared they support it unconditionally, while 32.7 percent  said that if they have to choose, they support the newly  launched cabinet, the SANKEI said.    The SANKEI and Fuji Television Network conducted the survey  on Friday and Saturday.    Of the pollees, 45.1 percent cited pump-priming as the most  important policy for the Hata cabinet, followed by 21.1 percent  stressing tax reform, 14.9 percent political reform, and 8.4  percent the rice issue, according to the SANKEI.    A large proportion -- 61.5 percent -- of the respondents  support the pullout of the SDP from the coalition.    The LDP, the largest opposition party, garnered 22.3 percent  support, followed by 11.3 percent for Shinseito [Japan Renewal  Party], headed by Hata.    In a KYODO NEWS SERVICE public opinion poll released Sunday,  the Hata cabinet posted a 51.6 percent public approval rating,  down 24.1 percentage points from that for the Hosokawa cabinet  last August.</p>

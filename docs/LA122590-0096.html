			<p><P> December 25, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOLLYWOOD PARK;  </P> <P> ROYAL REACH BIDS AULD LANG SYNE WITH VICTORY  </P> <P> As Marje Everett appeared in the paddock late in the day Monday at Hollywood  Park, a trainer nodded in her direction and said: "I wonder if this will be her  last day here."  </P> <P> The answer probably won't come until a bitter, expensive proxy fight ends early  next year. Everett's argument, that company debt has been reduced and that  shareholders are receiving dividends again, is in contrast to business being  bearish. On the day before Christmas, the 37-day meeting lurched to a  conclusion, with 14,852 fans coming out to bet the Auld Lang Syne Handicap and  eight other races.  </P> <P> That was the lowest closing-day crowd Hollywood Park has had since it began  racing in the fall in 1981. The figures for the entire season were mixed, with  betting up almost 4% on a daily average over last season and attendance down  close to 4%.  </P> <P> The handle would been lower than last year's average except for money that  flowed into the Hollywood pools for the first time from Nevada, Birmingham Race  Course in Alabama and Canterbury Downs in Minnesota. Those three sources  accounted for betting of more than $365,000 a day.  </P> <P> Overall, Hollywood Park's daily fall handle -- $5.4 million -- was the best  since off-track betting in California was introduced in 1987, but total  attendance, on- and off-track, averaged 20,932, which is a drop of more than  11% from three years ago. Figures do not reflect attendance from the  out-of-state betting sites.  </P> <P> Corey Nakatani, who won three major stakes -- two with Itsallgreektome and one  with Countus In -- earlier in the season, rode Royal Reach to a wire-to-wire  victory in the $84,450 Auld Lang Syne. The margin over Intelligently was  officially a nose, but the placing judges said it was more like an inch.  </P> <P> Intelligently lagged 11 lengths behind at one point, then barely missed running  down Royal Reach at the wire. Davon finished third, three lengths back, in the  1 1/4-mile grass race, which was run in 1:59, only two-fifths of a second  slower than the track record.  </P> <P> Royal Reach, owned by George Layman Jr. of Nanches, Wash., and trained by David  Hofmans, had finished ahead of only three horses in his last four starts,  losing by a total of 56 lengths. The 4-year-old gelding's last victory came in  allowance company at Del Mar more than four months ago.  </P> <P> "The problem in the last couple of races was that he raced in between horses  and got scared," Hofmans said. "Then we had him in a couple of races where he  couldn't get the lead and he kind of panicked."  </P> <P> When Hofmans saw that Flanders Moss was scratched from Monday's race, he was  convinced that Royal Reach would have no trouble making the early lead.  </P> <P> "We had our own way today," Nakatani said. "I was told to get out there, set an  easy pace and ask him to run at the three-eighths pole. He had his own way and  was going real easy down the backside. We slowed them down (a half-mile in 46  4/5 seconds), and when I asked him to kick, he kicked."  </P> <P> Still, Intelligently, who has been running in expensive claiming races since  coming here from France, was making the longest strides at the end.  </P> <P> "This horse was flying," said his jockey, Alex Solis. "I wasn't sure if we had  won it or not. That other horse was walking near the wire, and I thought we had  the momentum to get him. My horse gave me a nice kick, but it just wasn't  enough. That other horse set such a slow pace, and he opened up too many  lengths for us."  </P> <P> Royal Reach, carrying 115 pounds, one less than the top weight, paid $15.20.  The Aga Khan's Deliorman, an Irish-bred colt making his American debut and  carrying 116 pounds, was sent off the 19-10 favorite. He was never a contender  and finished fifth in the nine-horse field. Lyphard's Melody, who ran eighth,  is owned in part by R.D. Hubbard, the Texan who initiated the proxy battle  against Everett.  </P> <P> Horse Racing Notes  </P> <P> In an extraordinary comeback, Chris McCarron wound up the leading jockey at the  meet with 54 victories. Last June 3, McCarron broke his legs and his right arm  in a spill at Hollywood. He has won 11 titles at Hollywood. . . . Gary Jones  won the training title with eight victories. . . . Rae Rafko, a 2-year-old  daughter of Chief's Crown making her first start, won the fourth race and paid  $104.80. She is trained by Steve DiMauro, a New Yorker who is wintering in  California. . . . The last race was won by Port Washington for another New York  trainer, Greg Martin. Port Washington tested positive for cocaine after running  fourth at Hollywood on Nov. 8 and a hearing will be scheduled.  </P> <P> Gary Stevens' lead over Jose Santos is almost $700,000 in the battle for the  national money championship. . . . Santa Anita opens Wednesday with the Malibu  Stakes, which has drawn 12 horses. Santos rides Profit Key, who drew the  outside post. Stevens rides Greydar, who won the Affirmed Handicap at Hollywood  in his last start. Others running are Burnt Hills, Bedeviled, Past Prince, Due  to the King, Forty Niner Days, Doyouseewhatisee, Copelan's Game, Pleasant Tap,  Magical Mile and Restless Con, the Haskell Handicap winner at Monmouth Park who  makes his first start in three months.  </P></p>

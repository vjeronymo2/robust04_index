			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Peter Mackler] </F>   [Text] Davos, Switzerland, Jan 30 (AFP) -- Israel and the  PLO appeared moving toward a breakthrough Sunday [30 January] in  talks on Palestinian autonomy with the PLO accepting a  compromise proposal hammered out by negotiators overnight.    Working groups laboured through the night and morning hours  to nail down details of the Israeli withdrawal from the West  Bank town of Jericho and Gaza Strip under an accord signed in  September.    'Abd-Rabbuh, a spokesman for the Palestine Liberation  Organisation, told reporters in this Alpine resort town that  there was now a compromise on the table and "we accept it."    He would not give details of the proposal or say explicitly  whether the Israelis accepted it. But he added, "I can't say  that there is any problem holding up an agreement."    Israeli officials were not immediately available for  comment.  Israeli sources said the proposal was being transmitted to Prime  Minister Yitzhaq Rabin.    Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, who had lengthy  talks  with PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat late Saturday and was to meet with  him again outside the World Economic Forum here, was asked  earlier if they were close to a breakthrough. "Closer than  yesterday," he replied.    He told reporters the two hours of discussions he had with  'Arafat at their hotel here Saturday were constructive but he  refused to say whether they would produce an accord.    'Arafat declined to comment on progress, telling reporters  at  the hotel where he and Peres were staying: "You will have to  wait."    "Yesterday it was going well and we hope today we continue  on  the same lines," 'Arafat said.    Israeli Environment Minister Yosi Sarid said the working  groups of negotiators met until 3 a.m. (0200 GMT) Sunday and  resumed at about 7 a.m (0600 GMT). He said they would continue  their work and then 'Arafat and Peres and full delegations would  meet again.    Asked about progress he said: "As long as documents are not  being signed, I don't want to speculate about progress."    Peres is due to fly out Sunday night for Washington. But  when asked if he was leaving Sunday night, he only said: "Maybe."    'Arafat had said at the start of his discussions with Peres,  their first since a meeting in Oslo a week ago, that they hoped  to get an accord here or at least "a main platform for an  agreement."    Peres had added: "There are serious differences between the  parties, but we are here with serious intentions. We will do  all that is possible to answer hopes for peace."    Under an agreement signed on the White House lawn on  September 13, the Israelis were to have started a four-month  withdrawal of their troops from Jericho and the Gaza Strip on  December 13.    But Israel and the PLO have been wrangling over who should  control border crossings with neighbouring Jordan and Egypt, the  size of the Jericho autonomous area and security for Jewish  settlements.    Sarid had said earlier that if there was an agreement later  Sunday it would focus on the size of the Jericho and Gaza  autonomous areas as well as on the border crossings but leave  many other issues still to be resolved, such as the status of  Palestinian authority and administrative arrangements in the two  areas.    "There are many legal questions which we have not even  discussed," Sarid said.    'Arafat had arrived from Tunisia on Saturday after appealing  to US President Bill Clinton for help in ending the impasse  which he blamed on the Israelis. He made the same request of  British Prime Minister John Major on Friday.</p>

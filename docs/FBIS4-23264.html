			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Jacques Pinto] </F>   [Text] Lagos, June 1 (AFP) -- Anti-government demonstrators  took to the streets on the outskirts of Lagos on Wednesday [1  June] a day after an ultimatum from pro-democracy groups to  Nigeria's junta to stand down expired, an opposition spokesman  said.    An official in the Committee for the Defence of Human Rights  told AFP that protestors had put up barricades in northern  suburbs and also blockaded roads leading out of Nigeria's  economic capital to the east and to the west. Eyewitnesses  confirmed that protestors had put up roadblocks and set tyres on  fire in Abule Egba, some 50 kilometres (30 miles) outside the  centre of the sprawling metropolis.    The rights committee spokesman said the demonstrations began  the morning after a deadline given by the National Democratic  Campaign (NADECO) to the regime of General Sani Abacha to stand  down expired at midnight Tuesday. The protests in the suburbs  were "a symbolic action in support of the NADECO agenda and to  register their (the people's) displeasure against continued  military rule," the spokesman said, asking not to be named.    National radio began broadcasts Wednesday with a warning to  NADECO from police chief Ibrahim Coomassie that a ban on  political activity and public gatherings remained in force.    The police chief called on "all genuine advocates" of  democracy to take part in a national constitutional conference  the regime plans to organise from June 27 as a key point of its  programme to restore elected civilian rule. Any other political  programmes would be considered "illegal," Coommassie warned.    The NADECO, which comprises many prominent Nigerians,  including former government ministers and state governors,  retired military figures and rights activists, has dismissed the  planned conference as a ruse by the military to hold on to power.    It called on Abacha, who seized power last November and  scrapped all Nigeria's democratic institutions, to go by  midnight on March 31 [as received] and hand over to Moshood  Abiola, held millionaire businessman held on unofficial results  comfortably to have won a presidential election.    That poll, held on June 12 last year, was billed free and  fair by international observers but annulled by then military  ruler General Ibrahim Babangida, who alleged irregularities.  Two months later, Babangida stepped down, installing an  unelected civilian adminstration, which Abacha ousted.    Abiola on Tuesday told journalists at his Lagos home that  "if  NADECO calls on me to form a government, I will form a  government." "Abacha is a goner," he said.    The military administrator of Lagos State, Colonel  Olagunsoye  Oyinlola, for his part warned that police had been put on alert  to prevent any breaches of the peace.    The annulment of the poll last year led to bloody  demonstrations in several parts of Lagos. Residents of some  city districts continued Wednesday to stock up on food, hiking  the prices of basics such as rice, for fear of trouble.    Abiola, a Moslem from the Yoruba ethnic group with support  notably in southwest Nigeria, said he had contacted a number of  leading Nigerians with a view to forming a national unity  government.    Africa's most populous nation, with some 88 million people,  has many ethnic groups, of which the largest are the Yorubas and  Ibos of the mainly Christian south and the Hausa-Fulani of the  predominantly Moslem north.</p>

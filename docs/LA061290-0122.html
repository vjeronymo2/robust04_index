			<p><P> June 12, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> PRO AND CON ON HOPE LAND SWAP  </P> <P> Some people and organizations have said that they support the land exchange  arranged by the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy. However, they say that  doesn't necessarily mean they support the development plans at Jordan Ranch for  750 estate homes and a PGA tournament-style golf course, all adjacent to  national parkland at Cheeseboro Canyon.  </P> <P> Do not miss the point: The only reason for the swap is to obtain land for a  road that will open up to growth the developers' landlocked property.  Advocating the swap is promoting development.  </P> <P> Furthermore, the developers have more than these 750 homes and golf course on  their drawing boards. The extension of Thousand Oaks Boulevard from Agoura  Hills to Calabasas and the extension of Victory Boulevard from the San Fernando  Valley to Malibu Canyon Road, with related urban development, are next.  </P> <P> ROSEMARY FRAZHO  </P> <P> Westlake Village  </P></p>

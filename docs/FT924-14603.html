			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Row erupts over treasury bill boycott call A CALL by the populist Lombard League to refuse to buy Italian treasury bills has provoked a parliamentary storm and the threat of legal action. The call yesterday by Mr Marco Formentini, the league's parliamentary spokesman, was seen in parliament as an attempt to undermine Italy's credibility in time of financial crisis. Mr Franco Reviglio, the budget minister, described the interview as 'irresponsible', and Mr Claudio Martelli, the justice minister, announced he was considering legal action. This is the latest escalation of the league's campaign to embarrass what it regards as a corrupt, free-spending government in Rome living at the expense of the hard-working north. The league has also advocated a campaign of non-payment of taxes. But it has become more vocal in the wake of its dramatic success in elections in the northern city of Mantua two weeks ago, when it obtained 34 per cent of the vote and humiliated the traditional parties. The league has also forced the government to change its mind about postponing other regional elections and these will now go ahead in the northern cities of Monza and Varese on December 13. By calling for a boycott of treasury bills - which are widely bought by small Italian savers - the league may have overstepped itself by forcing the other parties closer to the coalition government. Yesterday, Mr Reviglio said the government would be seeking a vote of confidence in the chamber of deputies on the decree, announced two months ago, seeking special authority to carry out reforms of pensions, public health, the civil service and local administration. The senate has already passed the decree but it has become bogged down in the chamber of deputies and the government is anxious to push it through as quickly as possible to speed up discussion and approval of the 1993 budget. It is the second time the government has sought a motion of confidence, the previous occasion being the July emergency budget.</p>

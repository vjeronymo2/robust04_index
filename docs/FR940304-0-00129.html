			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. State Authorization  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As explained in the preamble to the May 3, 1993, Technical Correction to the September 10, 1992, rule, EPA is treating the majority of the final used oil management standards in the same manner as ``non-HSWA'' Subtitle C requirements. The used oil management standards became effective on March 8, 1993, only in those States and Territories that do not have RCRA base program authorization and on Indian lands. States are required to revise their Subtitle C base programs to adopt the new used oil requirements (including those promulgated in today's rule) by July 1, 1994, or by July 1, 1995, if a statutory change is necessary. See 58 FR 26420 and 57 FR 41605.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Authorized States are only required to modify their programs when EPA promulgates Federal standards that are more stringent or broader in scope than the existing Federal standards. Section 3009 of RCRA allows States to impose standards more stringent than those in the Federal program. For those Federal program changes that are less stringent or reduce the scope of the Federal program, States are not required to modify their programs. See 40 CFR 271.1(k). Except for the amendments made to &sect;279.20(b), the standards promulgated today are less stringent than or reduce the scope of the existing Federal requirements. The amendments made to &sect;279.20(b) merely provide clarification of the existing used oil regulations and are therefore not considered to be less stringent than the current Federal program. Therefore, with the exception of the provisions added at &sect;279.20(b)(2)(i), authorized States would not be required to modify their programs to adopt requirements equivalent to or substantially equivalent to the provision listed above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Executive Order 12866  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under Executive Order 12866, 58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipient thereof; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the ``Executive Order.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OMB has exempted this regulatory action from E.O. 12866 review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The reporting and recordkeeping requirements of part 279 have been approved by OMB and generally assigned the control number 2050&hyph;0124 (See 58 FR 34374 (June 25, 1993)), which remains in effect. As today's rule does not impose any new such requirements, a separate information collection request was not prepared.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VII. Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Today's rule does not impose any new regulatory requirements, and indeed, decreases the costs of compliance for a number of facilities. I therefore certify that today's rule will not have a significant impact or a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VIII. Administrative Procedures Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Today's rule takes final action on EPA's 1985 and 1991 proposals to exempt used oil inserted into primary refining processes from the used oil management standards. EPA did not address these issues in its September 10, 1992, final rule, and therefore those proposals remained outstanding until today's rule. Since these issues were fully addressed in those proposals, further public comment on today's rule is unnecessary. The other changes being made in today's rule either correct errors or clarify the language contained in the September 10, 1992 rule. No comment is necessary on these provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

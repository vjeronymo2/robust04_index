			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Higher margins help Kwik-Fit A TWO THIRDS increase in pre-tax profit is a rare sight in a recession, but Kwik-Fit Holdings, the tyres and exhaust fitter, delivered it yesterday. By pushing operating margins up from 10 per cent to 15 per cent and reducing interest costs by nearly Pounds 4m, it turned a 17 per cent rise in sales into 66 per cent at the pre-tax level. This was in spite of losing Pounds 770,000 on asset sales, compared with a Pounds 2.04m profit. The pre-tax figure for the year to February 29 rose to Pounds 32.1m (Pounds 19.4m) on turnover of Pounds 253.8m (Pounds 229.4 including a discontinued business). Earnings per share, helped by a lower tax rate of 30 per cent, rose 73 per cent to 13.27p (7.67p). The previous year's pre-tax profit and earnings figures were restated from the original Pounds 24.5m and 10.82p respectively to show a reduction in the exceptional gain on a business sale. This was caused by the reinstatement of a Pounds 5.08m goodwill write-off to comply with a new accounting standard. Operating profit, unaffected by the changes, advanced by 51 per cent to Pounds 34.5m (Pounds 22.8m). Net debt of Pounds 19.1m at the previous year-end was turned into Pounds 3.52m cash. Mr Tom Farmer, chairman and chief executive, said margins had been helped by an increase in sales of higher margin products, especially exhausts. Prices had gone up by 7 per cent but the cost of running a depot had been kept level by focusing on savings. A net 13 depots were opened, bringing the total to 599, of which 480 are in the UK with most of the rest in the Netherlands, where record results were achieved. Mr Farmer said 27 outlets would be opened in the first half of this year. Tyres, which carry a lower margin, accounted for 50 per cent of sales. There had been an upsurge in demand in December and January as tighter regulations on tread depth took effect. Most of the fleet business is in tyres. Exhausts accounted for 32 per cent of sales. Mr Farmer said the market had got over a dip caused by manufacturers fitting longer-lasting products, which had delayed replacement. A final dividend of 2p makes a total of 3.35p (2.75p). COMMENT Kwik-Fit has responded to the recession as if its market had been seriously affected, which it has not. Two years ago it curtailed its expansion dramatically after increasing the number of outlets by 55 per cent in a similar period. The big cut in capital spending has been mirrored in the control of cost minutiae from head office to the depots. Coupled with price and demand increases in a make-do-and-mend era, the cash has rolled in. The company even shrugged off criticism from the Consumers Association with the help of its well-oiled marketing machine. This year, from a strong financial position, the rate of openings is being stepped up, as it must be for future growth. A pre-tax profit forecast of Pounds 36m gives a prospective p/e of about 13 on yesterday's close of 189p, a little short of the market. With the UK's vehicle fleet still ageing and additional custom causing little extra cost, this looks undemanding.</p>

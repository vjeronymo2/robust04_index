			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / International Company News: Losses widen at S Korean beer producer Oriental Brewery, South Korea's largest beer producer, suffered a loss of Won19.8bn (Dollars 24.5m) for the first half of 1994, compared with a loss of Won7.3bn a year ago. This was due to increased competition and higher investment costs following the expansion of production facilities. The fall reflects a loss of market share, to 61 per cent from 70 per cent, due to the introduction of brands by Chosun Brewery and Jinro-Coors, Korea's two other breweries. Chosun reported a 76 per cent growth in net earnings to Won2.2bn, primarily due to the success of Hite beer, the country's first non-pasteurised beer, which increased the company's market share to 33.6 per cent from 29.5 per cent. Ssangyong Motor, South Korea's fourth-largest motor vehicle producer, reported a loss of Won34.1bn for the first half of 1994, against a loss of Won19.4bn a year ago. It blamed the deficit on heavy investment spending. Sales rose 135 per cent to Won381bn as demand for commercial vehicles rose. Ssangyong plans to enter the passenger car market in 1996 in co-operation with Mercedes-Benz of Germany.</p>

			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Burial of stranded whales postponed The burial of 11 whales, which died after being stranded in Orkney, has been postponed because the chosen site turned out to be a Viking settlement. Environmental health officers will travel to the north island of Sanday today to find another location for the disposal of the 11 sperm whale carcasses, each weighing around 50 tonnes.</p>

			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / RMT ballots members on BR peace plan THE RMT, the main rail union, yesterday started balloting its 60,000 members on whether to accept a British Rail peace plan. The plan seeks to defuse a dispute over redundancies and the use of contract labour which led to two 24-hour stoppages last month. The RMT executive committee is recommending that its members reject BR's proposals. The result of the ballot, to be completed later today, will be known on May 14. Mr Jimmy Knapp, the union's general secretary, said there was still 'a lack of clear commitment and conviction in British Rail Board's statements'. He added: 'If compulsory redundancy is not foreseen for the next couple of years why will the board not guarantee it will not be used?' He added that the union believed that BR could 'be forced to give the protection for the future we are seeking' over the use of contract labour. BR said yesterday that the message for the union was clear: 'Think before you vote. More strikes will mean less security for railway jobs.' BR has said it foresees no need for compulsory redundancies over the next couple of years and also that there are 'no plans for a major extension' to contract labour for track maintenance over the next couple of years. Mr Arthur Scargill, leader of the NUM miners' union, said yesterday that his union executive would wait for the outcome of the RMT ballot before deciding whether to call a further 24-hour strike in protest at pit closures. London busworkers are due to strike again on Monday in protest at cuts in their pay and benefits. They have already held four one-day strikes. Their union - the TGWU general workers' union - is organising a mass petition in their support among the capital's travelling public.</p>

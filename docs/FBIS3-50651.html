"Only a sincere understanding on the essential, the first  step toward an indispensable union, can save the country," the  general noted adding that "this understanding must be the result  of ample dialogue." "It is essential for it to be a national  debate. The country must question itself, its future. It must  find solutions for the structural problems that are obstructing  the evolution of society and the free play of democratic  institutions," Cedras said.    "By losing brotherhood, all that is left for us is division,  hatred, and violence," he stated, adding that "1994 will be  decisive for our country."</p>

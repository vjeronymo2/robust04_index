			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Andrey Popov, economist, Deputy of the State </F> Duma from the Agrarian Party of Russia: "An Alliance of Bankers  and Peasants Will Save Russia's Fields"]    [Text] An agrarian deputy rang up the editorial  office. And he very politely inquired whether LITERATURNAYA  GAZETA could make its pages available for constructive criticism  of the point of view repeatedly expressed in the newspaper  regarding the kolkhoz-sovkhoz system as a burden and an  impediment to our movement toward a bright capitalist future.  Inasmuch as the deputy turned out to be a professional  economist, who took part, by the way, in developing banking  legislation, the telephone conversation quickly turned into a  friendly discussion, which, however surprising (for the subject  of criticism were the appearances in LITERATURNAYA GAZETA of B.  Fedorov's and my own articles), ended with an ascertainment of  the coincidence of our views on quite a few points. On the  following day, the deputy brought an article to the editorial  office, which we are offering for your attention.    We are also prepared to give the floor to those who  have different views, but on one condition: Do not restrict  yourself to indiscriminate criticism, but propose constructive  ideas, and seek a way out of our current economic impasse.    [Signed] Vladimir Prokhvatilov, LITERATURNAYA GAZETA  columnist    Agriculture in Russia is in a disastrous state. The slump in  production is not ending for the second year, and the motor  vehicle and tractor inventory is falling apart. But what is most  regrettable is the fact that the agro-industrial complex simply  is not entered into the logic of the liberal reforms that were  conducted until recently. B. Fedorov, the former minister of  finance, saw the Russian APK [agro-industrial complex] as a  number-one inflationary danger, and he proposed purchasing  foodstuffs abroad at cheaper prices. Boris Fedorov and Yegor  Gaydar have resigned, but the attitude of the government toward  agrarians has practically not changed. At a recent meeting of  representatives of the agrarian faction of the State Duma with  V. Chernomyrdin, our prime minister almost kissed a cross as a  sign of his love for Russian kolkhoz workers, but he gave money  for the spring sowing grudgingly.    But is a lot of money needed, and what for? Let us estimate.  In Russia, 120,000 hectares of kolkhoz land are under grain.  Approximately 60,000-70,000 hectares are sown annually, and  about 100 million tonnes of grain are gathered from them. If the  government needs this amount of grain, then it is necessary to  allocate 8 trillion rubles [R] for the spring sowing. This will  go for the payment of fuel, mineral fertilizers, and repair of  equipment. If there is less money, there will also be less of a  harvest.    It seems that the government decided to allocate R5 trillion  for the needs of the APK in the form of credit at 213 percent  annual interest and to pay off debts for products that were  turned over last year. This is another R1.4 trillion. It is not  difficult to calculate that this is not enough money to maintain  the harvest at last year's level. The agrarians understand very  well that an appeal to the budget is futile. There is no money  in the treasury, but if you resort to monetary emission in order  to cover inadequate resources with its help, then we will have a  very severe inflationary outbreak that will destroy our economy.  But if money is not given, the consequences could even be worse.  There would be such a severe harvest shortage that it would  simply be impossible to compensate for it with any kinds of  purchases abroad. In addition, the inflationary expectations of  the population on the threshold of an approaching famine would  instantly draw long lines and would clean shelves of all  foodstuffs. This would cause a sharp jump in prices....    So this is what the unhappy alternative is. And I fully  admit  that many Russians will not be pleased by this choice between  the Scylla and Charybdis, and that they would prefer to send all  Russian kolkhoz workers to the moon and to buy wheat in America  and Canada. Well, first, this would denote a full loss of  national sovereignty. And, second, a year earlier the government  of reformers tried to send the Russian VPK [military-industrial  complex] "to the moon" by simply not continuing to finance it.  As a result, the social resistance was of such a force that the  government went back on its word and fully restored the state  order for the defense industry. There is nothing good in such  shying away.    And, third, the financial inadequacy of the Russian  kolkhozes  is not their fault at all. From the time of the notorious war of  the city and the village in the 1920's, which ended with the  robbery of the village, Russian peasants have been unable to  stand on their feet firmly. It is as if peasant and subsequently  kolkhoz property were inferior, an embryo of private property  relations, as if it were considered a socialist virtue to take  everything from the village, without returning anything. In a  paradoxical way, the liberalization of prices in 1992 robbed the  village in precisely the same way once more. The disparity of  prices between rural and industrial commodities grew even more.  By comparison with 1992, all prices "took off" by a thousand  times and more, but rural products increased in price by a  factor of only 100-120. While earlier one tonne of grain was  equal in cost to 1.5 tonnes of fuel, then now this ratio is  already 1:0.65. The same thing happened not only with grain, but  also with other agricultural products.    And those who are dissatisfied with the increasing prices  for  bread and milk should know that the peasant receives only  one-third of this price. For comparison: In the price of beer,  80 percent is "added" by the producer.    Well, and where is the poor peasant to turn, you ask. Is  there a constructive solution to the present impasse? Of  course there is. It is off-budget financing. While there is no  money in the treasury, there is money in the commercial banks.  Economists of the Agrarian Party of Russia conducted  consultations with a number of commercial banks and established  that they are prepared to finance the spring sowing from their  own resources, given the presence of certain guarantees.  According to our calculations, by involving commercial banks, it  is possible to collect the money that is lacking and to save the  1994 harvest. This, of course, will not reduce the budget  deficit, but it will "stretch it out" in time, and remove the  seasonal outbreaks of inflation.    And incidentally, the necessary guarantees can be given. At  least, V. Gerashchenko, the chairman of the Central Bank,  appearing in the State Duma, supported such an idea.    The off-budget financing of the agrarian sector by  commercial  banks, in our opinion, can be implemented in two ways. First,  Russian banks give the necessary special credits to the Ministry  of Agriculture under a small, for example, 3-percent margin,  after receiving in exchange the guarantee (promissory note) of  the Ministry of Finance. This is the way the lacking resources  are "acquired," and moreover, rather quickly. But it is  necessary to hurry--it is already time for Krasnodar Kray to  start sowing, but there is no money.    Second, it is necessary to develop direct horizontal ties;  that is, banks and kolkhozes should communicate between  themselves directly. This kind of drawing together, which is  still rather timid, has started. For the time being, our bankers  are more interested in the sphere of livestock raising,  especially in poultry farming, where there is an uninterrupted  production cycle. Bank credits can be granted to kolkhozes under  a promissory note of a regional administration, or 10-30 percent  of the shares of stock of a joint-stock company (which 70  percent of our kolkhozes have already become) as security.    The first method of financing will give a quick effect, and  the second is calculated for the future. This, perhaps, is the  only method today to save Russia's perishing agriculture and to  conclude a peace that is favorable to everyone in the exhausting  and senseless war between the city and the village. And the  government of V. Chernomyrdin, which up until now has not  declared itself in any way, can stimulate this constructive  process by convening a "roundtable" of bankers and agrarians,  while playing the role of organizer of the negotiations and a  guarantor of agreements.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] We have received a statement by the press service of  the National-Democratic Congress of Ukraine in connection with  the victory of Yuriy Meshkov, leader of the Republican Movement  of Crimea [RDK], in the Crimean presidential elections. It  says, in particular:    The stability of a state is guaranteed by adherence to the  fundamental law, both by its citizens and by all branches of  power. Unfortunately, Ukraine is one of those states where the  Constitution is ignored by many political forces and power  structures. The guarantor of the Constitution, the president of  Ukraine, resorts to defensive statements as he watches it  happen. The presidential elections in the Crimean autonomy were  a gross violation of Ukrainian laws, including the Constitution.  They were held in an atmosphere of blatant Ukrainophobia, with  the overt financial support of benefactors from the ruble zone.    The Ukrainian state leadership remained, by tradition, on  the  sidelines, maintaining a so-called balanced stand. These  circumstances, as well as the socioeconomic situation in the  state, brought RDK leader Meshkov and the Russia political bloc  to executive power. The Russian Federation has acquired another  lever to exert pressure on Ukraine. This particularly concerns  the Black Sea Fleet and the deployment of Russian armed forces  on the territory of the Ukrainian state.    The Russian media, particularly Ostankino and Vesti  [television channels] competed with one another in asserting  that Crimea was choosing a new political course. The RDK leader  won the votes of almost half of the adult population in the  peninsula. Thus, the results of the voting proved that the  Crimean population indeed chose a new course, looking to Russia  for the economic transformations and financial injections it  promises. Therefore, the results of the Crimean presidential  elections give good reason for radical reconsideration of  Ukraine's economic policy.    Separatist Meshkov's success is also a result of the absence  of a clear information policy in Ukraine aimed at strengthening  its statehood. The developments of the past few months showed  that Ukraine's leadership fails to command proper weight in the  regions. Will officials from the RDK abide by Kiev's laws, while  putting forward the declaration of the peninsula's full  independence as one of their main objectives?</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interviews with two unnamed leading members of </F> the UDA by Paul Goodman; place and date not given]    [Text] The Ulster Defence Association [UDA], Northern  Ireland's main loyalist paramilitary organisation, has  threatened to extend its terror campaign to the Republic of  Ireland.    In an interview with THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH, two leading  members of the outlawed organisation, which carries out  sectarian murders against Catholics in Northern Ireland under  the the title of Ulster Freedom Fighters, also warned that it  will continue its activities even if the IRA eventually calls a  permanent ceasefire.    The warning, in the wake of the IRA's refusal to extend its  three-day ceasefire of last week, will deal a further heavy blow  to John Major's peace initiative. The IRA resumed its campaign  early yesterday morning shortly after the ceasefire ended, when  shots were fired at two army checkpoints near Newtownbutler,  County Fermanagh.    The two UDA leaders, who described themselves as the heads  of  the UDA's southeast Antrim and south Belfast battalions, also  confirmed that the UDA has drawn up contingency plans in the  event of civil war in Northern Ireland, which they believe is  moving closer, and called for clarification of the Downing  Street declaration.    In what appeared to be a direct threat to members of the  Irish Government, one of the men said: "There's a price to pay.  They haven't paid it yet...all their dues are being recorded  and they'll have to pay up."    The Republic, they said, must abandon its constitutional  claims on Northern Ireland, and what they see as "one  geographical state thinking" aimed at removing Northern Ireland  from the United Kingdom and bringing about a united Ireland.    They described the Irish Government as part of a  "pan-nationalist front" that includes the IRA, Sinn Fein and the  SDLP [Social Democratic Labour Party]. The UDA's campaign would  therefore continue, they said, since in the event of an IRA  ceasefire the constitutional claim would remain.    One of them confirmed that the UDA would continue its  activities even were the IRA to lay down its weapons  permanently: "There must be a prize for the IRA to call a  ceasefire. The reasons for it would have to be closely looked  at. Our days of reacting to the IRA are over as far as we are  concerned. Our agenda now is pro-active."    The other man said: "We see a grim future. I think civil  war gets nearer by the month, and that's not warmongering,  that's a fact."    Anyone who believed that Unionists would allow themselves to  be drawn into a united Ireland was "making a big  miscalculation," he said.    "The feeling in our community now is that violence pays.  Morale has worsened since the declaration was signed. The only  people that we can trust are ourselves."    The UDA leaders said that the joint declaration by the  British and Irish Government "means nothing to us." However,  they added that clarification would be welcome: "The IRA want  to know ,what comes next. We would like to know that too."    The two men said the UDA is stepping up its political  profile. A working party is drawing up a paper based on two  previous publications, Beyond the Religious Divide and Common  Sense, which favour power-sharing in Northern Ireland, and a  bill of rights. "It aims to fuse the two together, and we  expect to publish it in about two months."    They indicated that the UDA may propose an independent  Northern Ireland, which would have links with Britain and the  Republic within an expanding EC. Nationalists in Northern  Ireland would be allowed to pursue their aspirations  democratically, although institutional north-south links were  ruled out.    "We can all be good Europeans, and are willing to extend the  hand of friendship towards London and Dublin. But we will never  be forced into a united Ireland."</p>

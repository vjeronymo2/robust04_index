			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by S. Denny] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg April 14 SAPA -- The African National  Congress [ANC] on Thursday [14 April] demanded the immediate  withdrawal of the visa of visiting American David Duke, a former  member of the Ku Klux Klan and avowed right-winger. Mr Duke, a  former U.S. congressional candidate, arrived in South Africa on  Tuesday on a private visit.    "His purpose here seems to be to stoke up the war psychosis  which has already been ignited by a broad coalition of black and  white right-wing extremists," the ANC said in a statement in  Johannesburg.    "He said on his arrival there had not been 300 years of  oppression (in South Africa), but years of opportunity.    "This country would be better off without this sort of  malicious meddling in our affairs," the ANC said. South Africans  did not need Mr Duke, the ANC said, adding that he should not be  given time on radio or television to air his "noxious" views.    "The ANC demands the immediate withdrawal of his visit  permit  to South Africa."</p>

			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / International Company News: WMX takes control of Ohio-based group International refuse hauler and environmental services company WMX has further specialised its toxic waste clean-up operations by acquiring a controlling interest in an Ohio-based group called OHM Corporation. The deal, an exchange of assets for shares, is valued at about Dollars 75m. WMX subsidiary Rust International has agreed to swap its hazardous and nuclear waste remediation services business units, including about 900 employees and specialised hazardous waste treatment equipment, to OHM in exchange for 10.4m shares, or about 40 per cent, of OHM stock. The transaction is subject to the approval of shareholders in both companies. The deal will allow Rust International to focus on its core environmental services businesses, while giving OHM a dominant position among the small group of US companies that specialises in cleaning up big hazardous waste sites under the government-directed Superfund programme. As part of the transaction, WMX has agreed to provide OHM with low-cost financing for the next five years. OHM last year had net income of Dollars 4.4m on sales of Dollars 242m. Mr James Kirk, OHM chairman, said the deal would 'yield a significant improvement in our financial position and enhance our ability to fund our growth with access to lower-cost financing'. After combining Rust's hazardous waste remediation operations, OHM will have about 3,100 employees, a client portfolio evenly divided between public and private sectors, and a contract backlog of about Dollars 2.1bn.</p>

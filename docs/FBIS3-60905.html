The bomb went off in the Co [county] Tyrone village of  Fintona at 12:16 a.m., said the Royal Ulster Constabulary.    A spokesman said there were believed to be casualties after  the fire brigade sent to the scene called for an ambulance.    The target of the bombing was not known but was thought to  be  the local police station, which was closed at the time.</p>

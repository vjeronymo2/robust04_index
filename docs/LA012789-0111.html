			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WILSON, UCLA BEAT COUGARS ON THE REBOUND  </P> <P> UCLA basketball Coach Jim Harrick has described the road as mean, ugly and  nasty.  </P> <P> It got meaner, uglier and nastier Thursday night until Trevor Wilson rebounded  his own missed shot and scored on a layup with 2 seconds left to give the  Bruins a 64-63 victory over Washington State.  </P> <P> Wilson's shot capped a furious rally by the Bruins, who overcame a 10-point  deficit in the last 5:15 before a crowd of 4,040 at Friel Court.  </P> <P> "Can I borrow your hair dryer?" Harrick cracked afterward, only a short time  after Pooh Richardson almost knocked him over with a bear hug.  </P> <P> The game-winning play was an act of desperation, Wilson said.  </P> <P> "I did everything I could to get the rebound because I knew Coach was going to  give me an earful for taking that (first) shot," he said.  </P> <P> Actually, it wasn't bad.  </P> <P> After posting up and taking a pass from Pooh Richardson, Wilson went up for  about an 8-foot jumper along the baseline.  </P> <P> The shot bounced out, and Wilson took the rebound away from Washington State's  Brian Quinnett and banked in a shot off the glass.  </P> <P> What could the Cougars have done differently?  </P> <P> "Get the rebound," Coach Kelvin Sampson said tersely.  </P> <P> Sampson had reason to be upset.  </P> <P> Washington State, which lost its previous 3 games by 42, 18 and 27 points,  controlled this one for 35 minutes.  </P> <P> "Sometimes it's better to be lucky than good, and tonight UCLA was lucky,"  Sampson said. "The best team didn't win that game. We deserved to win that  doggone game, and I think it's a crying shame we didn't.  </P> <P> "This is probably one of the toughest losses I think I've ever had. I've never  seen a team that deserved to win more than that."  </P> <P> UCLA, though, jumped the Cougars down the stretch to improve its record to  11-5, including a 6-2 mark in the Pacific 10 Conference.  </P> <P> Washington State, loser of 6 straight games, is 6-11 and 1-7.  </P> <P> The Cougars are going so bad that Sampson said earlier this week of Sunday's  game against USC, winless in the Pac-10: "It looks like that game is going to  be a battle for the cellar."  </P> <P> A 3-point play by Richardson started the UCLA rally, cutting the Bruins'  deficit to 50-43 with 5:15 left.  </P> <P> UCLA continued to whittle away at the Cougar lead, getting a 3-point shot from  the corner by Kevin Walker with 3:02 left to make it 57-55.  </P> <P> Finally, after Washington State's Anthony Kidd missed the first of a  one-and-one free-throw situation with 1:40 left, UCLA had a chance to tie or go  ahead for the first time since the opening minutes.  </P> <P> Richardson, though, missed a 3-point attempt and Darryl Woods rebounded for the  Cougars. However, at the other end, Quinnett missed a 3-pointer for WSU, and  Richardson chased down the rebound in the corner.  </P> <P> On the ensuing fast break, Wilson was fouled by Quinnett with 43 seconds left  and UCLA trailing, 61-59.  </P> <P> After Wilson made the first free throw and Washington State called time out,  Harrick moved the 6-foot 10-inch Walker from midcourt, where he normally lines  up, to a position on the right side of the lane.  </P> <P> "I thought he could get a tip-in," Harrick said.  </P> <P> Walker didn't get a tip-in, but he grabbed the rebound of Wilson's missed free  throw, kept the ball aloft and banked in a short jumper to give UCLA a 62-61  lead with 41 seconds left.  </P> <P> "He had a lot of poise on that play," Harrick said.  </P> <P> Having squandered a lead that reached 13 points with less than 10 minutes left,  the Cougars looked to be dead.  </P> <P> But Quinnett, who scored 23 points on 11-of-16 shooting, drilled a fall-away  jumper in the lane with 23 seconds left.  </P> <P> UCLA set up the game-winning play, on which Wilson, who scored 21 points, was  the first option.  </P> <P> Said Harrick: "When Trevor forgets about all the things that are going on in  the world and just plays basketball, he becomes a force."  </P> <P> Wilson scored 12 points in the last 6:49, all but taking it upon himself to  save UCLA from what could have been a devastating loss.  </P> <P> Bruin Notes  </P> <P> Pooh Richardson scored 17 points for UCLA but had a season-high 7 turnovers and  only 4 assists. In his last 6 games, Richardson has 29 turnovers and 30  assists. . . . Don MacLean, held scoreless and limited to only 1 shot in the  first half, scored 11 points. The freshman forward has scored in double figures  in 11 straight games and 15 of 16. . . . Kevin Walker scored 11 points and  pulled down 8 rebounds, his highest rebound total in 11 games.  </P> <P> UCLA's Darrick Martin hyper-extended his right knee in the second half and  limped off the court. He returned a short time later but was held without a  point for the first time this season and didn't attempt a shot in 29 minutes. .  . . UCLA Coach Jim Harrick: "We just couldn't get anything going, couldn't get  anything generated. I think that's a credit to them. They were well prepared  and played very physically and emotionally." . . . UCLA scored a season-low 24  points in falling behind by 11 at halftime. . . . UCLA will play Washington  Saturday in Seattle.  </P></p>

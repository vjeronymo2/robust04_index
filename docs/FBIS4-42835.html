			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "People's Party for Freedom and </F> Democracy and Labor Party Differ on Health Care"]    [Text] Health insurance threatens to be a stumbling block  to the formation of a "purple" coalition comprised of the PvdA  [Labor Party], the VVD [People's Party for Freedom and  Democracy], and the D66 [Democrats 66]. That became clear  yesterday following negotiations between the leaders of the  three parties, Kok, Bolkestein, and Van Mierlo respectively.    The VVD and the PvdA have serious differences in viewing the  future of health care. The PvdA wants to avoid people on the  lowest incomes paying much more for health care. The PvdA wants  to make any personal contribution dependent on earnings. If that  does not seem possible, the PvdA wants a risk insurance linked  to incomes. The VVD believes that the risk insurance must be  the same for everyone.    Last night Kok described the talks on health care as "a test  case for the `purple' coalition." Kok believes that extra  charges for the lowest paid in this area must be "limited as  much as possible" because "they already find it difficult to  meet these costs."    Yesterday, Kok and D66 leader Van Mierlo did not reject VVD  leader Bolkestein's suggestion to form the new government on a  5-5-4 basis: Five ministers for the PvdA, including the prime  ministership, five for the VVD, and four for the D66.    Van Mierlo described Bolkestein's proposal as "workable and  conceivable." Kok stated that "the negotiations must first be  concluded in terms of content before considering the question of  the allocation of ministerial posts." The PvdA has 37 seats in  the new parliament, the VVD 31, and the D66 24. Kok: "Working  on the basis of 14, a 5-5-4 split seems logical in a way, but  other forms of reasoning are perhaps possible."    Bolkestein repeated yesterday that he would not be a member  of the new cabinet. "I do not want to commit myself, but my  preference is to be party leader, for the simple reason that I  am a supporter of dualism and my hands would be tied too much as  a minister." He stated that if Kok were to be prime minister,  it is likely that he would be assisted by two deputy prime  ministers, one from the VVD and one from the D66.    The negotiators were again hopeful yesterday on the progress  of the talks. Van Mierlo: "It is getting more difficult, but  we are getting there." Bolkestein: "I have become steadily  more optimistic in recent weeks."    Prime Minister Lubbers said in Leiden yesterday that "the  party leaders and the politicians who have been appointed by the  Crown to assess the feasibility of the various coalitions,  should try to complete their work this month. I am not against  a `purple' coalition, but it is desirable for it to be achieved  in the short term. The country needs a government," Lubbers  stated. A "purple" coalition is considered to be a good outcome  on the basis of the election results.</p>

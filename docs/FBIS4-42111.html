			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] President Glavkos Kliridhis stressed that the  decision falls within the joint Cyprus-Greece defense doctrine  whether to build air, navy, or other bases in Cyprus. President  Kliridhis made the statement after his meeting at the  Presidential Palace today with Lieutenant General Alevromayiros,  first deputy chief of the Greek Army General Staff. He also  expressed full satisfaction over the joint Cyprus-Greece defense  doctrine and noted that at the meeting they also exchanged views  on the doctrine, adding that both sides are proceeding with the  preparation of a Cyprus defense plan.    President Kliridhis also referred to the Turkish plan, which  was revealed by the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation last night,  aimed at justifying their rejection of the confidence-building  measures [CBM's] by creating the impression that the coexistence  of Greek and Turkish Cypriots is impossible. The president  expressed the conviction that the Turks will not succeed in  justifying their positions because, he stressed, it is well  known that there have been no provocations by the Greek Cypriot  side. He added: The Turkish side rejected the CBM's because of  a lack of political will.    Lt. Gen. Alevromayiros expressed thanks to the Cyprus  Government for the material and moral support it renders to  ELDIK [Greek Forces of Cyprus]. [passage omitted]</p>

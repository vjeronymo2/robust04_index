			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Aleksandr Potyomkin and Georgiy </F> Shmelyov]    [Text] Krakow February 23 (TASS) -- Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev outlined a new concept of all-European  partnership, addressing a conference of Russian and Polish  economists and political experts "on the way to new partnership"  held in an ancient cathedral in Krakow.    The most important out of the seven elements of partnership  suggested by Kozyrev is the development of European-Atlantic  interaction. This interaction should be based on the  transformation of CSCE into an efficient regional political  organisation, and the Council of North Atlantic Cooperation -  into an independent structure of military and political  cooperation closely connected with the CSCE.    The aim of this is to coordinate efforts made by NATO, EC,  the Council of Europe, the European Union and the CIS in the  field of strengthening stability and security, peace-keeping  activities and defence of rights of ethnic minorities in Europe.    Kozyrev suggested creating a network of complementary  bilateral agreements on partnership, cooperation and  consultations not only between NATO and countries of Central and  Eastern Europe. "We do not rule out that Russia might become  part of NATO some day, but the idea of partnership is the key  problem today," he said.    "The dignity and far-sightedness of the "Partnership for  Peace" programme adopted by NATO leaders is that it works as if  opening NATO, taking a first step on the way from changing it  from a bloc into another form of ensuring security, thus fully  meeting our concept of the European partnership. In  perspective, we expect the opening of the communications channel  "The CIS - NATO," Kozyrev said.    "We want to put into practice a principle of indivisibility  of security on the entire European continent," said Polish  Foreign Minister Andrzei Olechowski, addressing the conference.  He said that the way to such Europe without demarcation lines  lies through the expansion of existing Western European  structures.    In Olechowski's opinion, "partnership for the sake of  transformations" is necessary in relations between Poland and  Russia. He called on the West to render no less assistance to  Russia than to Poland. Russia should have a permanent seat in  the G-7, the European Community should give Russian goods an  access to the European market, and financial institutions and  developed Western countries should effectively support the  stabilisation and convertibility of the Russian rouble, the  Polish minister said.    "The whole world is aware of it, agrees with it, but is not  in a hurry to offer aid," Olechowski said.</p>

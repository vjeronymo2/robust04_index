			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report] </F>   [Excerpts] Differences have emerged between Hizballah  Secretary General Hasan Nasrallah and Sayyid Muhammad Husayn  Fadlallah. The differences came into the open when Hizballah  held a memorial service in the Southern Suburb for the martyrs  of the Zionist aggression against Hizballah's camp in 'Ayn  Kawkab in al-Biqa' and the program did not include a speech by  Fadlallah.    It is worth noting that this was the first time in more than  10 years that Fadlallah had attended a function without  delivering a speech.    A number of Nasrallah's supporters left a ceremony held by  the Iranian Embassy on 5 June to mark the anniversary of Imam  Khomeyni's death when Fadlallah mounted the rostrum to begin a  speech.    It should be recalled that Fadlallah and Nasrallah share the  loyalty of Hizballah members. But the Hizballah secretary  general has been trying for more than a year to "purge" the  party's ranks of the supporters of Fadlallah and the former  Hizballah secretary general Shaykh Subhi al-Tufayli.    Within this framework, Nasrallah has been having his  supporters distribute a book of remarks about Fadlallah's  course. He has also been telling his supporters that Shaykh  Subhi al-Tufayli is responsible for the clashes that took place  between Hizballah and the Amal Movement. [passage omitted]    Nasrallah is currently facing problems with many Iranian  parties because of the many setbacks Hizballah has suffered  since Nasrallah assumed the post of secretary general. These  setbacks--which he suffered among the Shi'ah scholars, party  members, and the general public--recently forced him to expel  more than 250 party members for various reasons.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, May 30 (AFP) -- French philosopher  Bernard-Henri Levy on Monday [30 May] reversed a decision on  fielding candidates in forthcoming European elections on a  "Sarajevo" platform, which had thrown mainstream parties into  disarray.    His list, made up of French intellectuals and led by cancer  specialist Leon Schwartzenberg, "will not go to the vote," Levy  said in a statement.    His supporters would "continue to campaign" but "have  decided  to pursue their action in other ways."    Instead of running for seats in the Strasbourg parliament,  Levy and his supporters would set up a national committee called  "Vigilance Sarajevo."    Opinion polls showed that the list of Levy, who is a  partisan  of the mainly Moslem Bosnian government, could win up to 12  percent of the vote in France in the June 12 poll.    But this would be achieved notably by taking votes away from  mainstream parties such as the Socialist Party of Michel Rocard.    Levy had said that the aim of fielding candidates had been  to  ensure that the debate on the Bosnian conflict was at the heart  of the European election campaign, and had forced both the  socialists and right-wing government onto the defensive.</p>

"Everything depends on how the NP behaves itself. I am  considering releasing the documents one by one to the media  before the election. If F.W. de Klerk and the others want to  intimidate other parties, then I will definitely throw my cards  on the table. All that I am prepared to say now is that the  documents in my possession also contain things that happened  during Mr. de Klerk's time as state president," according to  Gen. Holomisa. Last year Gen. Holomisa announced at a press  conference that he, apart from the now well-known documents  concerning the "signal" that the eastern Cape activist Matthew  Goniwe and his associates "should be permanently removed from  society," also has other documents in his possession on  government "covert" actions. The announcement of this "signal"  by General Holomisa directly resulted in the reopening of the  inquest into the murders of Goniwe and the others on the  insistence of President de Klerk.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The members of the Third Path have said they  established their movement in defiance of the Labor Party and  their own movement, the United Kibbutz Movement [UKM]. They  wish to convey a warning that if Israel does not protect the  Golan Heights, their movement will turn into an open revolt  against Labor and the UKM, and they will consider establishing  an independent party.    Our correspondent Shula Schmerling reports that the heads of  the Third Path, who are members of the Golan kibbutzim, denied  reports alleging they had received financial aid from other  parties. According to them, all of their financial assets come  from domestic sources, but refused to name them.</p>

			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / International Company News: Chinese steelmaker buys HK group SHOUGANG Corporation, the acquisitive mainland Chinese iron and steel maker, has purchased 25.12 per cent of Eastern Century, a Hong Kong-based metals and minerals trader, for HKDollars 164.2m (USDollars 21.2m). This is Shougang's second foray into the Hong Kong market - in October it bought a controlling interest in Tung Wing Steel, a steel trader and distributor - and follows acquisitions as far afield as Peru and California. The company, also known as Capital Steel, is believed to be in the bidding for Overseas Trust Bank, which has been put up for sale by the Hong Kong government. Eastern Century was listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange in April last year. Its main business is the trading of manganese ore and manganese ferro-alloys - essential raw materials for steel making. Last year it went into a mainland venture for the production of manganese ferro-alloys when it established Xinyu Far East Ferro Manganese and Shanghai Shenjia Ferro-Alloys. Shougang, with headquarters in Beijing, published its financial results to coincide with the deal. Last year, it earned pre-tax profits of Yn3.2bn (Dollars 555.5m) on turnover of Yn13.4bn - the highest profit before tax of China's top 500 national companies. Fixed assets were valued at Yn30bn. Mr Chan Chun Keung, chairman of Eastern Century, said: 'The injection of Shougang's capital, expertise in technology and management will further the group's interest in the People's Republic.' After the deal, Mr Chan's shareholding in Eastern Century, will fall to 28.28 per cent from 45.98 per cent, and that of Deeside International, a French investor, will fall from 16.61 per cent to 5.79 per cent.</p>

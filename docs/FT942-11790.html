			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Lloyd's All credit to Lloyd's of London for trying to transform itself from an expensive club into a rational market. The proposed introduction of pre-emption rights for Names, similar to those enjoyed by shareholders in the equity market, is a small step in this direction. Risk-based capital requirements for underwriting syndicates should also bring returns more closely into line with risks. Lloyd's might then stand a better chance of developing a mix of business capable of generating consistent profits. Lloyd's will look an odd-ball among financial markets until capital is allocated to syndicates on the basis of price, rather than favours and queueing as at present. That giant leap will probably involve Names exchanging syndicate participations for shares in specialist Lloyd's companies which can be traded. Exactly how that might happen, and what form the new companies might take, was left open by yesterday's report. In managing any such transition, though, the interests of Names will have to be carefully protected. Having relied on private individuals to ride out the recent underwriting storm, Lloyd's must give them a fair chance to recoup their losses under the structure which is now emerging.</p>

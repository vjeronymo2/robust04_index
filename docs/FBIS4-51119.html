			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Kuan Chieh (7070 2212): "Two CPC Orders on </F> Expanding the Police Force"]    [Text] Li Peng Endorses Orders Strengthening and  Expanding the Police Force    Every country in the world has its own police force.    The responsibilities of a country's police are to preserve  social order, curb crime, and protect the people. Of course,  there are police who suppress the people.    The mainland has added the word "people's" to its police, to  read the "People's Police." They should do more than the police  in other countries in doing good for the people and serving the  people but this is not the case.    As the mainland police have disclosed, in 1993, 7 percent of  public security personnel were dismissed from their posts or  transferred out of public security departments and about 3,400  public security personnel were given criminal punishments or  expelled from the CPC. This included more than 120  section-level public security cadres. This situation suggests  that, from one angle, the public security contingent is  irrelevant to "serving the people" and neither is it a reliable  tool of the party. This is, of course, a tragedy for the CPC,  which entrusts its political power to the armed forces and the  police force.    In order to strengthen and expand the police force, on 28  March this year, Premier Li Peng endorsed Order No. 12 of 1994  on "Strengthening, Rectifying, and Expanding the Public Security  Contingent" and Order No. 13 of 1994 on "Supplementing and  Improving the Armed Police Force."    Order No. 12 was issued through the Ministry of Public  Security to the party committees of all provincial (autonomous  regional) and city public security departments (bureaus) in  early April whereas Order No. 13 was issued to all provincial  (autonomous regional) and city armed police corps on 8 April.  <H5>  The State Council Allocates 1.8 Billion Yuan to Public </H5> Security Departments and Security Control Departments    Order No. 12 points out: In light of their social  environments, all provinces (autonomous regions) and cities,  from 1994 to 1996, should rectify and strengthen the leading  groups of their public security contingents and develop these  contingents in the ratio of 2 or 4.5 public security personnel  per million of population, depending on the local conditions.  In some important cities and in cities or regions where party,  government, scientific, technological, and industrial  organizations are concentrated, public security contingents  should be formed in the ratio of 6:1,000.    Viewed from provincial public security departments'  arrangements, the country will increase public security  personnel by 400,000 from 1994 to 1995; the central and local  authorities will build or expand 70 to 80 public security  schools, 10 or 12 of which will be senior public security  schools. The central government will be responsible for 40  percent of the funding and local governments will allocate the  remaining 60 percent. The central government will increase the  percentage of fund allocation for some key provinces and cities  appropriately. In mid-March, the State Council allocated 1.8  billion yuan for public security departments and security  control departments. An informed source confirmed that 35,000  cadres (including demobilized soldiers) from localities and  government institutions had been sent to work in public security  departments.  <H5>  The State Council Provides the Ministry of Public Security </H5> With More Power To Use Force    With the State Council's authorization, on 1 March the  Ministry of Public Security issued the "Regulations on the Use  of Arms During Patrols and When Performing Duties." The  regulations point out: Arms can be used against any resistance  to arrest, any attempt to resist, any action of violent  resistance, or any assault on public security personnel. Arms  can be used to stop agitation in public or state buildings and  any attempt to destroy state buildings, public property,  government institutions, and vehicles, if persuasion proves to  be of no avail. Arms can be used to stop assaults on party,  government, and military institutions; public security  departments; detention centers; prisons; financial  organizations; banks; and important state departments. Arms can  be used to stop assaults on radio and television stations as  well as central and local press and news agencies, if a warning  proves to be of no avail. Arms can be used to stop assaults on  airports, seaports, customs departments, and frontier stations.  Arms can be used to stop assaults on power stations, water  supply centers, and railway departments, if a warning proves to  be of no avail. Arms can be used to stop any attempt to  blockade highways, shipping routes, railways, bridges, and  tunnels, if a warning proves to be of no avail.  <H5>  Tao Siju: The Public Security and Armed Police Forces Will </H5> Deal With All Eventualities    Order No. 13 points out: Local governments should exercise  direct leadership over armed police units. Armed police and  public security units should be integrated. From 1994 to 1996,  the country will expand the People's Armed Police Force [PAP]  personnel to 450,000, improve the quality of the personnel, and  enhance their efficiency in performing mobile duties. By the  end of 1994, a three-level armed police force mechanism  comprising provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities  directly under the central authorities), prefectures, and  counties will be formed.    It has been learned that more than 38,000 demobilized  soldiers and soldiers on active service joined the PAP in 1993.  Tao Siju, PAP political commissar Ministry of Public Security  chief, said: The central task of public security and armed  police units is to improve their quality, raise their work  consciousness, and enhance their combat effectiveness. During  an inspection of a police academy in early April, Tao Siju said:  From now on, the public security and armed police forces will  deal with contingencies. In an important region, the public  security and armed police forces should be able to dispatch  40,000 to 50,000 personnel to the scene of any eventuality  within four hours. In the case of an emergency, they should be  able to dispatch 5,000 to 8,000 personnel to the scene within 20  minutes.    He also said: About 80,000 cadets will graduate from public  security and armed police academies this year and they will be  assigned to work in all parts of the country. These academies  will recruit 150,000 cadets this year. Unqualified personnel  will be removed from public security departments within three  years.  <H5>  The People's Police Have Become Tools To Suppress the People </H5>   The abovementioned examples prove that the CPC is  strengthening and expanding its police force.    Social order on the mainland is deteriorating. This is  obvious to all. It is also an indisputable fact that the  quality of mainland public security personnel is low, as is  their efficiency in cracking criminal cases. Such being the  case, the CPC needs to strengthen its police force.    Apart from maintaining social order and curbing crime, the  public security and armed police forces are also responsible for  cracking down on dissidents. To cope with one dissident, dozens  or even hundreds of policemen are used. This includes following  and keeping a watch on the dissident. When Wei Jingsheng tried  to return from Tianjin to Beijing, seven truckloads of police  were mobilized to stop him. If used this way, the police force  does not have adequate personnel to cope with eventualities. In  addition, the "Regulations on the Use of Arms During Patrols and  When Performing Duties" run counter to the "PRC Constitution,"  which stipulates that civilians have the right to hold  demonstrations.    The people's police have now become tools to suppress the  people. CPC leaders have removed the disguise of the  constitution and blatantly created the image of a police state  among the people. Did any fascist, police state in the world  ever come to a good end?</p>

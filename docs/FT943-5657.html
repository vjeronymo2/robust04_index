			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / International Company News: Volvo takes over German coach maker Volvo, the Swedish car and commercial vehicle maker, is taking over Drogmoller, the German bus manufacturer, in a move which accelerates the rapid concentration of the European bus industry. Mr Bjorn Larsson, president of Volvo Bus, said the takeover of Drogmoller, a maker of luxury tourist coaches with a turnover last year of DM56m (Dollars 36m) and a workforce of 250, was an important step in the Swedish group's effort to break into the German market, which is dominated by Mercedes-Benz and MAN, the domestic German commercial vehicle makers. The big European truck and bus makers are moving quickly to consolidate their hold on the small, and hitherto independent, bus and coach body builders in Europe, in order to guarantee the outlets for their chassis and drivelines (engines and gearboxes). The Volvo acquisition is the latest in a flurry of recent deals, most notably Mercedes-Benz's takeover of Kassbohrer, the German coach maker which markets its products under the Setra brand-name.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Robert Shrimsley: "Recovery Before Tax Cuts -- </F> Clarke"]    [Text] Mr Clarke, the Chancellor, signalled his  determination yesterday to push ahead with substantial tax  increases despite new Treasury figures showing that from April  the average family will be paying 35 percent tax compared with  32.2 percent under the last Labour government.    The last two budgets will now cost the average family an  extra 12.52 pounds a week.    Responding to the Treasury figures, which dented the Tories'  claim to be the party of low taxation, Mr Clarke said he would  continue to "impose whatever tax is necessary" to secure growth  and boost employment.    He seemed unabashed by the figures and said he would  continue  with the tax rises to bring down public borrowing. That would  ensure that the confidence in the recovery was maintained.    "I will do what is necessary, some of it unpopular, in order  to create the right conditions for growth to continue," he said.  "First you have to create the wealth. Helping business get the  jobs has to be the first priority. Then my aims of low taxation  can be achieved."    Tories were clearly shaken by the figures, which were  released by Mr Stephen Dorrell, Financial Secretary to the  Treasury, in response to questions from Ms Harriet Harman,  Labour's Treasury spokesman.    Senior backbenchers said it was now politically essential to  cut taxes before the next election.    Although Mr Clarke said the Treasury figures were  meaningless  because take-home pay had risen significantly, Tories fear that  the loss of their most potent political claim could be extremely  damaging.    Mr John Townend, chairman of the backbench finance  committee,  said: "We are the party philosophically of low taxation. If we  lose that label we are in trouble." The Treasury figures show  that a married couple with two children, living on an income of  19,450 pounds will now lose 21.9 percent of their income in  income tax and national insurance contributions, compared with  20.9 percent when Labour was last in office in 1978/79.    Once VAT [value-added tax] and other indirect taxes are  added, the figure rises to 35 percent.    The Treasury says that the overall rise in average earnings  has increased the average family's income by 14.40 pounds a week  -- but only 1.88 pounds of that will be left after the tax rises.    A family with an income of 14,590 pounds a year -- three  quarters of average earnings -- will have to pay 9.52 pounds a  week more in tax from April, while the bill for a family on  21,175 pounds will leap by 21.58 pounds.    Mr Gordon Brown, Shadow Chancellor, said the Conservatives'  failure to admit the truth about their tax policies meant that  "the country will never trust them on tax again."    Mr Clarke, interviewed on BBC TV's Breakfast with Frost  programme, stoutly defended his decisions and those of his  predecessor, Mr Norman Lamont, to raise tax.    "I have to impose whatever tax is necessary to get us more  jobs and more growth," he said. "That is my duty and no  Chancellor can ever tell people that he will never put up taxes."    He remained committed to delivering "the lowest taxation  that  would be responsible in the circumstances. It is only if you  actually create the wealth the country needs...then you are able  to keep taxation down and carry on spending on the great public  services.    "But first you have to create the wealth. Helping business  get the jobs has to be the first priority. Then my aims of low  taxation can be achieved."    The Government had demonstrated its commitment to sound  finances and his aim was to allow people to keep as much of  their money as possible. "I will put down tax when I possibly  can," Mr Clarke said. "It is one of my political aims. Taxes  will always be lower under me than they would be if I were  replaced by a Labour Chancellor or a Liberal Chancellor."    He remained upbeat about Britain's economic prospects: "We  are on course to get rid of the borrowing," he said. "I think  that has given a great boost to confidence, to the economy, and  we see the growth emerging, every prospect of the recovery  getting stronger.    "My judgment had to be: can this recovery stand the tax,  will  the horse get over Becher's Brook when it gets there in April?"    Mr Clarke went on: "I was confident that it would when I  had the Budget in November. I am more confident now because all  the figures coming out show that we have restored confidence.  The economy is growing in a way no other major economy in West  Europe is."    Mr Brown accused Mr Clarke and Mr Major of attempting to  deceive the country.    "The Conservatives are now making the biggest tax demands in  history," he said. "The Chancellor cannot deceive his way out  of the Tory tax embarrassment."    Mr Townend echoed the views of many Tory backbenchers' when  he said it was now "absolutely essential" that Mr Clarke should  reduce taxes to at least the level they were in l992 and  preferably lower, before the next election.    "All those spending ministers who were saying it was more  politically damaging to cut spending than to put up taxes have  now seen their chickens coming home to roost," he added.</p>

			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Leading Article: What is wrong with Mr Santer After the mismanagement on Corfu three weeks ago, there was always a chance that the re-launched process for selecting the European Commission president at today's special summit in Brussels would result in an unsatisfactory compromise. That risk seems about to become reality. In the wake of Britain's veto of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the German government has made a vigorous effort from the EU chair to find a candidate capable of rallying unanimous assent. Mr Jacques Santer has emerged as the favourite to be nominated today, mainly because no one has strong grounds for turning him down. The Luxembourg prime minister may be regarded as a safe choice. Unfortunately, he is an insufficently compelling one to be agreed without a proper debate on the future running of the Commission. Rather than select now a less than inspiring successor to Mr Jacques Delors, the heads of government would be well advised to wait until the autumn. A delay in the timetable set out by Chancellor Helmut Kohl might look like a setback. But it would allow time for the appropriateness of Mr Santer and alternative candidates to be openly discussed. In particular, it would permit a useful period for mandatory consultation with the European Parliament. In an editorial on April 27, the Financial Times suggested that the Commission president would need to combine the qualities of an effective administrator, an economic tactician able to help generate growth and jobs, and a visionary who could steer a Union that is widening as it becomes more integrated. The FT has also consistently argued that the secretive procedure for allocating this important office is undemocratic and should be reformed. If Mr Santer fulfilled in an ideal fashion the above three criteria, the shortcomings in the method of choosing him could perhaps be overlooked. He has shown competence running the Grand Duchy since 1984, and has plenty of experience of Euro-diplomacy. However, Mr Santer cannot be considered an optimal candidate for a job whose holder could play a vital role in shaping the Union up to the end of the century. The choice of a figure representing the lowest common denominator of member governments' wishes, selected under a process that exacerbates Europe's democratic deficit, would mark a wrong turning. The Commission presidency raises some exacting questions for Mr Kohl, the chairman of today's meeting. Mr Kohl has frequently underlined the need to increase the powers of the Strasbourg assembly, a goal only partly achieved with the Maastricht treaty. Initial soundings from newly elected MEPs indicate that Mr Santer is likely to receive at best an unenthusiastic endorsement. If Mr Kohl were to take the assembly inadequately into account during the consultation procedure laid down by Maastricht, that could damage both the chancellor and the chances of constructive relations between the parliament and the European Council. Today's summit will also require adroitness from Mr John Major. The UK prime minister will not want to deploy Britain's veto for a second time, not least because Mr Santer's appointment could serve Britain's interest of trimming the Commission's sails. However, other governments might realise the danger that a quick decision could turn out to be the wrong one. Any participant at today's summit with misgivings about Mr Santer's candidature should be encouraged to speak out. It is still not too late for a better choice.</p>

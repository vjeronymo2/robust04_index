			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Tokyo sticks to strategy for shoring up Dollars It could prove to be an expensive week for the Bank of Japan. In its attempts to shore up the dollar, it has thrown an estimated Dollars 3bn worth of yen at currency markets in recent days. So far the efforts have been in vain and the financial markets increasingly expect a change of strategy to co-ordinated interest rate measures by the Group of Seven leading industrial countries, including a cut in Japanese interest rates. But Japan's monetary authorities are anxious to avoid a cut in borrowing costs and, for the time being at least, seem prepared to continue spending yen in the dollar's defence. The crisis came out of a clear sky last week just as the central bank, which implements policy under the watchful tutelage of the Ministry of Finance, was congratulating itself on steering the economy out of recession. Since the last cut in the official discount rate in September - to 1.75 per cent, its lowest ever - the bank's governor, Mr Yasushi Mieno, has been under pressure for a further cut as the economy continued to stagnate. But the bank resisted the pressure, arguing that policy was sufficiently accommodating to engineer a recovery. In the last month, Mr Mieno's policy appeared to be vindicated by distinct signs of an upturn. Gross domestic product figures for the first quarter suggested the economy was at last recovering. A sustained rise in the Nikkei average pushed up asset prices and there were signs of a slight rise in consumption. Market sentiment moved firmly into line with the bank's - there would be no cut in interest rates. But last week unwelcome foreign intervention blew the policy off course. The currency crisis puts three main pressures on Mr Mieno for a relaxation of policy: The high yen is hurting the real economy by making exports uncompetitive. Few economists believe the incipient recovery could survive a yen/dollar rate above Y100 for long, and companies are clamouring for relief. The bank's heavy selling of the yen has pumped liquidity into Japan's money markets, forcing down overnight call rates to around 2 per cent - just a quarter point above the official discount rate. In the past that gap has been nearer half a point, and the narrower spread makes an official rate cut more likely. If intervention fails, Japan will be expected to participate in co-ordinated G7 monetary measures - a rise in US rates and cuts in Japanese and German borrowing costs. The bank's reluctance to cut interest rates is based on more than just the usual central banker's fear of inflation. The lessons of monetary history suggest that an interest rate cut too far, brought on by short-term pressures, can be costly. And though inflation is virtually non-existent, the bank is acutely aware of the dangers of taking its eye off the ball: 'The BoJ is anxious not to repeat the US experience,' says Mr Dick Beason, senior economist at James Capel Pacific, 'where a loose monetary policy for too long was partly responsible for the current global financial turbulence.' So, for now at least, heavy central bank selling of the yen seems set to continue. The bank is outwardly confident the crisis will pass, believing that economic fundamentals, particularly a trade deficit that has begun to shrink, will push the yen back well beyond the Y100 level to the dollar. But if the markets' desire to dump dollars becomes compulsive, there will be a limit to the profligacy and the unpalatable choice between a strong yen and an interest rate cut will become unavoidable.</p>

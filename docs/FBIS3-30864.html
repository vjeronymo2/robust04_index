Deputy Interior State Secretary Pal Kara became OVB  secretary. Members are Arpad Erdei, Hungarian Lawyers' general  secretary, Sandor Horvath, Independent Lawyers' Forum  vice-president, Istvan Kukorelli, dean of constitutional law at  Budapest Eotvos Lorand University, and Janos Nemeth, Eotvos  general deputy rector.    In keeping with the Hungarian-U.S. inter-governmental  agreement on intellectual property rights, Parliament today  amended a 1969 law, bringing it into line with European  legislation. A draft resolution was adopted to join the 1961  Rome Convention protecting performing artists, audio record  manufacturers, and broadcasters.    Changes concern rights of both authors and performers, as  well as the patents system. Earlier legislation covering  chemical, food, and pharmaceutical products protected the  manufacturing process, while now the product itself will enjoy  legal protection.</p>

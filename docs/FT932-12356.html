			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Wandsworth will use supply teachers to carry out tests WANDSWORTH Borough Council announced yesterday that it would bring in teams of supply teachers to administer national curriculum tests in its four secondary schools. The move improves the chance that Mr John Patten, education secretary, can salvage some meaningful results from this year's testing programme, which faces the threat of boycotts from three teachers' unions. It was immediately welcomed by the Department for Education as being 'in the interests of children and of raising standards'. Preparation for the tests is already being boycotted by the National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers. The appeal court last week refused Wandsworth's effort to obtain an injunction against the boycott. Mr Donald Naismith, the Conservative-controlled borough's director of education, has written to the headmasters of the schools, who are legally obliged to implement the tests if possible, offering 'support with the supervision and marking' of the tests. He added: 'To abandon all efforts to provide information about pupil progress this year would be to set back the whole programme two years for some pupils.' Mr Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the NAS/UWT, said he would not attempt to block Wandsworth's move. 'Effectively, they are bringing in people to help with the workload of the tests, which is what we wanted all along,' he said. 'It is interesting to note how extra money can suddenly be found for these purposes. It could set a very useful precedent to assist teachers with overload in many other areas as well.' Opposition to the tests now includes the Professional Association of Teachers. Mr John Andrews, PAT's general secretary, told Mr Patten that 'any tests that go ahead now are going to be patchy and incomplete'. Ms Ann Taylor, shadow secretary for education, said Wands-worth's action was 'incredibly confrontational'. She said she was concerned that Wandsworth 'have learned nothing . . .about the educational reasons for not going ahead with these tests'. Flaws in school testing, Page 25</p>

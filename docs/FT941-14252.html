			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Navy to have 18 more BAe Harriers Doubts over the government's plans for the Royal Navy's fleet of Sea Harrier jump-jets were lifted yesterday with the announcement of an order for 18 new aircraft worth a total of between Pounds 300m and Pounds 400m. The contract comes as a boost to British Aerospace's military aircraft division after more than 1,300 job losses announced in the past week in its civil aircraft and missile operations. The deal, awaited since last spring, was confirmed by Mr Jonathan Aitken, defence procurement minister, in a written parliamentary answer. BAe's work on building the improved FRS. 2 Sea Harriers is valued at around Pounds 200m, but this does not include the Rolls-Royce engines and other equipment. Fears were raised last autumn that the contract might be affected by defence budget cuts. BAe had hoped the contract would be announced at the time of the Royal Navy and British Army Equipment Exhibition in September. Yesterday's deal includes the conversion of a further five earlier-model aircraft to the FRS. 2 standard. These are in addition to 29 conversions being carried out under a Pounds 170m contract which BAe signed in 1988. Most of the work will be carried out at BAe's Brough plant in Humberside, with final assembly at Dunsfold, near Guildford, Surrey. Deliveries are due to start next year.</p>

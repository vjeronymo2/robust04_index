			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kiev, 16 Jan -- Delegates to an all-Ukrainian  conference of the Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists [KUN]  voiced their attitude toward the signing of a trilateral  agreement in Moscow on Ukraine's unilateral nuclear disarmament.  The fact that the president of Ukraine signed this agreement is  regarded by KUN as being counter to Ukraine's national  interests. KUN demands that the signed agreement be immediately  examined and rejected by the Supreme Council of Ukraine, that  the government be banned from taking any action to prepare for  its implementation, and that the president of Ukraine be  impeached and held liable.    In its election program, KUN will campaign for a clear-cut  division of power into legislative, executive, and judicial, for  a reform of law-enforcement bodies, dissolution of the Security  Service of Ukraine, and the establishment of effective state  security services. KUN will campaign for adoption of laws on  government and public service with a strict system of  accountability for the actions of state institutions. In the  economic policy area, KUN will campaign for private ownership,  giving priority to agriculture and industry. In the foreign  policy area, KUN stands for Ukraine's cooperation with all  countries. The Congress [word indistinct] for a non-nuclear  Ukraine in a non-nuclear world.</p>

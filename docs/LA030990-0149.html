			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 3 DUARTE CAR DEALERSHIPS IN BANKRUPTCY CLOSE THEIR DOORS  </P> <P> Duarte Nissan Inc., which owns three dealerships in the city's 210 Freeway  Autoplex, shut its doors this week, less than two months after filing for  protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  </P> <P> Gates to the sprawling facility were locked Thursday. Car models were still on  display in the showrooms and outside.  </P> <P> Two security guards posted near the entrance said the business had been shut  down since Monday afternoon.  </P> <P> The closure apparently prevented customers from picking up their cars.  </P> <P> Basile Georgescu of Tujunga said Thursday he has tried for the last 12 days to  retrieve the $7,700 used car he bought in February and left to be serviced.  Georgescu said he was told by officials of Tokai Credit Corp., Duarte Nissan's  major creditor, that he'd have to go to federal court to get his car back.  </P> <P> In a related development, Cecil Erwin, area commander for the investigation  section of the state Department of Motor Vehicles' inland office, said the  agency is investigating complaints from Duarte Nissan customers about improper  title transfers and misrepresentation by salespeople. He would not elaborate.  </P> <P> An attorney for Duarte Nissan, Robert Mayer, confirmed the dealership's  closure. But he referred other questions to the owner, Bruce Low. Neither Low  nor other company officials could be reached Thursday.  </P> <P> Duarte Nissan -- which includes Nissan, Isuzu and Suzuki dealerships -- had  remained open since it filed for reorganization of its debts and protection  from creditors under Chapter 11 in January, Duarte City Manager Jesse Duff  said.  </P> <P> In an interview two months ago, Low said the dealership's financial troubles  stemmed from a suit against one of its creditors, but he would not elaborate.  Low said about 10 employees, mostly salespeople, were laid off when the company  filed for bankruptcy.  </P> <P> Auto sales had surged since the businesses moved to the Autoplex in Duarte.  Last year, 5,000 models were sold for a total of $60 million, compared with  2,500 in 1988, when the firm was in Arcadia, Low said in January.  </P> <P> The three dealerships generated $300,000 of Duarte's $1.65 million in sales tax  revenue last year.  </P> <P> The 2-year-old Autoplex is on 47 acres near the Foothill Freeway on the  Duarte-Monrovia border. The Autoplex has 10 spaces for dealerships, five of  which are occupied.  </P> <P> When fully occupied, it was expected to generate $2 million to $3 million in  annual sales tax revenue for the city, which had contributed $7.5 million to  the project.  </P></p>

			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / People: A pain of political and corporate dimensions Britain annually loses 67m working days through back pain, at an estimated cost of Pounds 3bn, yet one of the lesser-known UK charities is the 25-year-old National Back Pain Association. Its new executive director, retired Major General Malcolm Hunt, 54, likes to joke that 'having been a pain in the backside for 35 years in the Royal Marines I felt well-qualified to do the job'. He is certainly up to putting backbone into an organisation which has not been a roaring success at fund-raising having led 40 Commando during the 1982 war with Argentina. His affection for the South Atlantic was such that his last military appointment was as commander of all three services in the Falklands and South Georgia. The type of organisational and managerial skills required for an undersung charity will have been well-honed in running the bleak Falklands military outpost at Mount Pleasant. 'It's a stimulating subject, with political, medical and business dimensions to it,' he says. Though total income has grown from Pounds 192,000 in 1991 to about Pounds 475,000 this year, the business community, Hunt feels, is surprisingly slack about assisting a charity, the results of whose research much more directly impinge on employment than what he calls the 'cuddly charities'. Hunt suffers no back problems himself, though he says: 'There are something like 20m back-pain sufferers in this country, with 2m-3m chronically disabled by it. That results in the equivalent of a city the size of Coventry - about 230,000 people - closing down each day.'</p>

			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Bleak forecast for German production THE OUTPUT of west German manufacturing industry is expected to decline by 1.5 per cent this year, and by up to 3 per cent next, according to the latest industrial forecast by the Ifo economic research institute. The gloomiest outlook of all is for truck and commercial vehicle manufacturers, where output is expected to fall by 8 per cent this year, and 10 per cent in 1993. The chemical industry is likely to be least affected by the downturn, according to Ifo, with an expansion of output of 1.5 per cent in 1992, followed by a slight decline of 1 per cent next year. A bleak picture for the whole industrial sector in western Germany emerges from the Ifo survey, the most reliable and comprehensive to be published on the economy. It says that the starting point for manufacturing industry next year is significantly worse than it was one year ago. Thanks to a steady fall in orders, order books now stand at an average of 2.6 months' production, compared to three months' at the end of 1991. Capacity utilisation has fallen from 87 per cent to 83 per cent over the same period. In October, 1991, just 16 per cent of the companies answering Ifo's industry survey reported disruption of production through a shortage of orders. The figure was 28 per cent last month. As for the number of companies intending to reduce their workforce over the next three months, the proportion has shot up from 19 per cent last year to 44 per cent today. The survey predicts a drop in output in the mechanical engineering industry of 6 per cent this year and 3-4 per cent next year, although the plight of the industry is less bad than it might have been, thanks to continuing strong expansion in demand from east Germany: up 20 per cent in 1992, and a forecast 18 per cent next year. The massive publicly-funded investment in east Germany is also a key factor in preventing a more serious downturn in the electrical engineering industry, particularly because of spending on transport infrastructure and telecommunications. The forecast for that sector is an output drop of 1 per cent this year, and up to 2 per cent next year. Where the downturn is most severe, its extent has been aggravated by the end of the surge in demand between 1989 and 1991 fuelled by unification. In that period, output of light commercial vehicles increased by 94 per cent, and of heavier vehicles by 70 per cent. In the first three quarters of 1992, deliveries of light vehicles in Germany was down by 8 per cent, and of heavier vehicles by 11 per cent. That slump is expected if anything to accelerate next year.</p>

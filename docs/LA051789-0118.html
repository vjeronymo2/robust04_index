			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Boeing Ban Threatened: Four European nations will ban commercial flights by  Boeing Co.'s new 747-400 series unless the U.S. company makes design changes  for greater safety, a Dutch spokesman said. Transport ministry spokesman Harald  Hameleers said the Dutch demanded modifications "months ago" in concert with  civil aviation agencies in Britain, West Germany and France, who together form  the Joint Airworthiness Requirements committee. Boeing Co. was not available  for comment. At issue are changes in the design of floor beams supporting the  400 series' upper deck, and better separation of certain electrical circuits,  Hameleers said.  </P></p>

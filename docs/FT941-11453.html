			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Inland Revenue to relax annuity rules The Inland Revenue has agreed to relax rules for members of some small pension schemes, in response to concerns that existing requirements force pensioners to purchase annuities at the bottom of the market. Government tax authorities are also said to be considering further clarifications of rules in order to allow people to buy so-called variable or staggered annuities. These spread annuity purchases over a longer period of time so that pensioners need not invest all their assets in a single low-yielding annuity contract. The new rules, which affect only Small Self-Administered Schemes, will allow scheme members to defer purchasing an annuity until a maximum age of 75. There are about 40,000 SSASs in the UK, most with two or three members each. Current rules require them to purchase annuities within five years of retirement. Mr Stewart Ritchie, pensions manager at Scottish Equitable, said: 'This creates difficulties, particularly for those who retire quite early.' In making the rule change, the Revenue said it had been prompted by the Association of Pension Trustees which raised the issue 18 months ago. Since then the price for retirement annuities has risen dramatically as interest rates have fallen, meaning that scheme members have had to pay far more now to buy benefits than they would have three years ago. With low inflation and low interest rates forecast for some years to come, annuity market conditions are unlikely to improve soon. Fixed-rate annuity prices are directly linked to the yields on 15-year UK government gilts, while index-linked annuities reflect a combination of 15-year gilts prices and the prices of UK government index-linked bonds. Mr John Bradley, chairman of the APT, said that between October 1992 and October 1993 yields on index-linked annuities fell 12 per cent while yields on fixed-rate annuities fell by 25 per cent. Mr Ritchie said that today a 65-year old male needs to spend Pounds 8.80 to buy Pounds 1 per year of annuity income. Two to three years ago, he could have bought the same benefit for Pounds 6.70.</p>

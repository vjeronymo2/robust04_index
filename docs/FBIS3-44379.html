This meeting was the first chairman office meeting since the  readjustment of the component members of the Beijing Planning  and Construction Commission. Chen Xitong, member of the  Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and secretary of  the Beijing Municipal CPC Committee, continues to serve as  chairman of the commission; Li Qiyan, mayor of Beijing  Municipality, serves as first vice chairman of the commission;  and Hou Jie, minister of construction, Zhang Baifa and Wang  Baosen, executive vice mayors of Beijing, Zhang Kezhi, deputy  secretary general of the State Council, Yao Zhenyan, vice  chairman of the State Planning Commission, Liu Mingpu, deputy  director of the General Logistics Department of the People's  Liberation Army, Chu Chuanheng, former vice minister of  construction and chief planner, and Xuan Xiangliu, secretary  general of the Beijing Planning and Construction Commission,  serve as vice chairmen of the commission. Zhao Zhijing serves  as director of the office of the Beijing Planning and  Construction Commission.    The meeting's participants listened to the report made by Ke  Huanzhang, president of the Beijing Research Institute for Urban  Planning and Design, on implementing the written reply of the  State Council on Beijing's new overall urban plan. Beijing  Municipality will muster an appropriate period of time next year  to energetically publicize this plan to make every household  aware of it.    Chen Xitong said in his speech: The important written reply  of the State Council on Beijing's new overall urban plan is  great support and encouragement to future construction and  development in Beijing. The new overall plan is a trans-century  project suiting the new situation of carrying out reform and  opening up, establishing the socialist market economy, and  accelerating the development of urban areas. He said: Planning  is the dragon's head of construction and development and is an  important lesson. Thus, we should conscientiously study and  explore it. When viewed from the experiences gained from our  practice and from the experiences gained by some cities in  foreign countries, overall planning must be strictly upheld  without any confusion. In carrying out the plan, we must have a  hard heart and strict demand and should not be afraid of giving  offense. Anyone obstructing this plan should not be tolerated  and no one should change the plan. Overall planning for the  capital is all the more influential and thus, it should be  upheld in an even stricter manner. Beijing must depend on the  guidance of the Ministry of Construction and on the endeavor of  all fields to build itself well in line with better planning  under the leadership of the central authorities.    Li Qiyan said in his speech: Urban construction and  development of Beijing has garnered the great support of various  central party, government, and military departments. We hope  that these departments will continue to vigorously support the  implementation of the State Council's written reply and  Beijing's new overall plan.</p>

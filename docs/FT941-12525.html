The USM-traded company has interests in bridal and formal wear and nursery care products. Mr Richard Shaw, chairman, said that since the launch of the new collections in the autumn of last year, retail sales were substantially ahead but second half sales to date would still be below expectations. Stronger sales added to cost savings should produce an improved result for the year, he added. 'But this will be substantially below market expectations and it is not clear whether the company will return to profitability in the 12 months to March 31 1994.' The shares lost 4p yesterday to close at 26p. Turnover was lower at Pounds 7.28m (Pounds 8.5m).

			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Global Custody (3): Relatively low risks and stable earnings - Profitability The attractions of global custody for the dozen or so banks that are serious operators in the market stem as much from what it does not involve as from what it does involve. It is not an activity like lending which requires the use of balance sheets and ties up capital, nor is it like securities and money markets, which is profitable in good times but suffers from poor returns in bad times. After the lending problems of many banks at the turn of the decade, and the let-down from 1993's trading annus mirabilis, these advantages are more firmly instilled than ever in most bankers' minds. Larger banks regard custody as having an attractive combination of relatively low risks and a stable annuity-like earnings stream for successful operators. Furthermore, custody has an obvious allure for many banks because it fits in well with other activities. Banks that are active in securities and foreign exchange trading see custody as a means of gaining captive business, so gaining more volume to pass through existing infrastructures. All have the basic requirement of being able to clear and settle transactions. Within the different forms of custodial business, global custody is also more attractive than domestic master trust and custody work in the US, and sub-custodianship in other domestic markets because of the growth in the market, and the potential for higher returns. Most global custodians argue that prospects are bright because of long-term investment trends. Ralph Mastrangelo, a managing director at JP Morgan, argues that the portfolio strategies of US fund managers mean that their need for global custody services is bound to grow. 'The search for yield is pushing them into new markets,' he says. This not only means more call for central management of funds, but the possibility of higher margin work. One custodian estimates that margins on the ancillary service of stock lending - one of the most attractive linked businesses - are only 25 basis points (hundredths of a percentage point) in the London market, but range up to 300 basis points in some emerging markets. Only banks with a strong presence in emerging markets as custodians can achieve this return. Such factors would appear to make global custody a highly attractive business for all banks. Yet the business remains one of the most highly concentrated of all banking activities. This is because of the high barriers on entry, and the intense competition on margins in the forms of custody which new entrants might be able to perform relatively easily. Pressure on margins has been a constant of the past five years. Alex Jablonowski, managing director of Barclays' global services arm, observes that 'custody is for the birds'. He says that the straightforward activity of holding securities in safekeeping and collecting dividends on equities and coupon payments on bonds produces miserly returns. The forcing down of margins has been accelerated by the sophistication of the bidding process for the largest contracts. Fund managers have become used to banks making aggressive quotes for the simplest forms of business to be allowed to carry out more profitable ancillary services. Basic custodial work is now done virtually free on the largest contracts. Alistair Reid, director of custody at Barclays, argues that banks can 'make good money by combining different themes' in custodial work even if the core product has been commoditised. The more profitable ancillary services include stock lending, foreign exchange contracts and all forms of derivatives to reduce risk and enter new markets. Mr Mastrangelo says that most bids are 'based on what a bank can get from the value-added side. The clients know that they are giving some gravy to subsidise the basic custody'. Similarly, Mr Jablonowski says that the most profitable activities are 'across markets and across products. The really horrible stuff is in a single product in a mature domestic market'. But the price of entry even to make such bids is also substantial, and becoming more so. Banks such as Chase Manhattan and State Street which have concentrated on custody and related businesses since the late 1980s have large technical infrastructures. At the heart of operations such as Chase's Infoserve arm are proprietory telecommunications networks. This has led to a tendency for consolidation among custodians, with smaller operators in the US selling businesses to those with an established advantage. Furthermore, fund managers who have undertaken custody are contracting out, a trend exemplified by Prudential Insurance in the UK to seek tenders for its global custody. Despite the pressure on margins in basic forms of custody, the large operators therefore face the possibility of becoming increasingly dominant in a growing market, and so being able to reduce their unit costs. The future of profitability for such operators is likely to centre on their ability to control the risks of custody, which can be substantial. One form of risk is credit. Although there is relatively little credit risk involved in basic custody, custodians have introduced forms of credit risk in an effort to offer more sophisticated services. One example is the now common practice of paying dividends or tax rebates to fund managers on set dates, whether or not the custodian has yet collected the money. One custodian argues that these forms of risk are not being priced properly at the moment. Because custodians tend to deal with large creditworthy fund managers, they have competed for business without taking true account of the risk of loss. 'The credit risk aspects of this business are not getting enough attention, and they are not being priced,' he says. Most custodians believe that an even greater risk is operational: the chance of failing to complete trades that a custodian has guaranteed, and so having to make up the shortfall of funds because of movements in securities prices. The risk can be exaggerated, given that custodians can also benefit from market movements, but it is particularly acute in emerging markets. Ms Vivian Eversole, executive vice-president of Chase Manhattan, says that the biggest risks 'are definitely operational. It is blowing a transaction or valuing a fund improperly'. Such risks are likely to figure more strongly in custodians' thoughts if margins on business in emerging markets erode without corresponding improvements in market infrastructure.</p>

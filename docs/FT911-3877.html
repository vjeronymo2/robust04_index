			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Silver shines amid antiques-trade recession: Saleroom ONE market, that for silver, seems to have bucked the recession in the antiques trade. London dealers were busy in New York at the weekend paying extraordinary prices for silver and other ornate works of art. SJ Phillips gave Dollars 159,500 (Pounds 92,544) for a Louis XIV silver pitcher, made by Francois Guillou, which had belonged to Henry Ford II and carried an estimate of just Dollars 25,000. The same dealer paid Dollars 330,000 (estimate Dollars 80,000) for an ornate French silver, gold, and hardstone neo-Gothic clock set with emeralds, made in 1881. Another London dealer, Partridge, secured for Dollars 66,000 an English Victorian parcel gilt 'Gothic' ewer set with enamel and jewels, made in Birmingham in 1855 by John Hardman. In 1983 it was sold for Dollars 5,000. One of the rare private collections of pre-revolution French silver sold for Dollars 2m at Christie's. All the 72 lots found buyers. The collection had been assembled by the late Rodolphe and Williamina Meyer de Schauensee. English furniture was less popular at Sotheby's, and a pair of George III kingwood and satinwood parquetry collector's cabinets of about 1770 sold for Dollars 88,000, below forecast. At Christie's, however, there was a satisfactory price of Dollars 660,000 paid for a George III walnut and parcel gilt secretaire-bookcase made in the mid-18th century. Buying was selective in an auction of Chinese export porcelain and works of art at Christie's in London yesterday. Two large 19th century hand scrolls depicting battle scenes doubled their forecast, selling for Pounds 24,200 to London dealer Sydney Moss. But an interesting punch bowl made in China in the late 18th century was bought in at Pounds 7,000.</p>

			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> VIDEO DISCOVERY: MORE VIDEOS:  </P> <P> "Smile" (1975), directed by Michael Ritchie. 113 minutes. Rated PG. One of a  series of Michael Ritchie films about America's unbending faith in traditions  and pageantry, no matter how tarnished.  </P> <P> In this one, it's a beauty pageant that takes it on the chin. Look for an  18-year-old Melanie Griffith as one of the contestants. D.L.  </P></p>

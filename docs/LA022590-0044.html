			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TIMES BOARD OF ECONOMISTS: REAGAN 'BOOM' JUST A LOT OF NOISE  </P> <P> The propaganda machines continue to roll out their celebrations of the  robustness and vitality of the U.S. economy. Here is another in my efforts to  provide at least a partial corrective. I focus this time on a recent effusion  on the New York Times Op-Ed page, a piece titled "The Reagan Boom -- Greatest  Ever" by Martin Anderson, former domestic adviser to the one-time actor and  former President.  </P> <P> With all his hyperbole, Anderson sounds more like a circus barker than an  economic analyst. He characterizes the "Great Expansion of the 1980s" or  "Reagan's Great Expansion" as "the greatest, consistent burst of economic  activity ever seen in the U.S. In fact, it was the greatest economic expansion  the world has ever seen -- in any country, at any time. . . . If we look at the  sheer size and immensity of it, at its scope and power, then it cannot be  denied that this expansion was the greatest."  </P> <P> Among several indicators of greatness, Anderson concentrates on two main  achievements of the long economic expansion beginning in late 1982: the  cumulative growth in employment and output that continued for seven years,  until late 1989. His claims about these particular successes -- to put it a  little bluntly -- are downright silly.  </P> <P> On the employment front, Anderson advertises the cumulative creation of 18.7  million new jobs as "a world record: Never before had so many jobs been created  during a comparable time period." But looking at the absolute scale of new  employment makes little sense as a measure of an economy's robustness since the  volume of job generation depends substantially upon the scale of the economy.  If a 1% annual increase in employment in China resulted in as many as 5 million  new jobs, would we argue that its economy was growing more robustly than the  U.S. economy in which a 2.6% annual increase in 1986-87 generated "only" 2.8  million new jobs? Claims of greatness should focus, in other words, on growth  relative to the previous size of the economy, not the absolute volume of the  growth.  </P> <P> And here Anderson's claims dissolve.  </P> <P> Civilian employment, the aggregate upon which Anderson appears to be basing his  assertions, grew by 18.9% in the seven years of expansion. By comparison, it  grew by 19.7% in the seven years from late 1970 to late 1977. (Have you ever  heard anyone refer to the "Great Nixon-Ford-Carter Expansion?") And it grew by  21.1% in only four years from 1933 to 1937. Do we really want to herald the  health of the U.S. economy in the middle of the Great Depression?  </P> <P> Or, since Anderson claims a world record, we might look elsewhere.  </P> <P> Civilian employment grew in the seven years from 1950 to 1957 by 20% in Japan  and by 19.1% in Germany. Shouldn't Germany and Japan be allowed at least a  share of the title? Or check out this example: Employment in Germany grew by  46.7% in the five years from 1932 to 1937, 2 1/2 times more rapidly than during  Anderson's seven magical years. Wasn't economic life fabulous as the Nazis  prepared for global conquest?  </P> <P> The same kinds of problems apply to Anderson's advertisements about the  cumulative growth of aggregate output. He cumulates the annual levels of gross  national product, or GNP, for the seven years from 1983 through 1989, totaling  "some $30 trillion worth of goods and services."  </P> <P> In this case he not only ignores the problem of relative (versus absolute)  growth, but he also doesn't even correct for inflation, using figures for  nominal rather than real GNP. Once we correct for inflation and the scale of  the economy, average real GNP during Anderson's effervescent expansion was 18%  higher than it had been in 1982. By contrast, average real GNP during the seven  years from 1963 through 1969 was 21% higher than it had been in 1962. To which  interval of seven years would you provisionally accord the "world record?"  </P> <P> How might we more sensibly assess U.S. economic performance during the 1980s?  </P> <P> A first guideline can help us avoid pitfalls such as overrating employment  expansion during the mid-1930s. We should look at the economic record for an  entire business cycle, not merely its expansion, since part of the health of  the recent expansion merely reflected a rebound from the devastating recession  of 1980-82 (just as the apparently impressive employment expansion from 1933 to  1937 pales considerably alongside the precipitous drop from 1929 to 1932).  </P> <P> By this standard, we should look at the full business cycle from 1979 to 1989  to assess the impact of conservative economic policies. Let's look first at a  comparison to our own past, concentrating on two crucial measures: the average  rate of growth of real GNP and the average pace of investment.  </P> <P> From 1979 to 1989, real GNP grew at an annual (compound) rate of 2.6%. During  the long boom from 1948 to 1966, the corresponding growth rate was 3.8%. During  the cycle from 1966 to 1973, it was 3.1%. During the 1973-79 "stagflationary"  cycle, it was 2.5%. So, during the much celebrated Reagan cycle, real GNP  growth was as stagnant as during the previous, much reviled Ford-Carter cycle  and only two-thirds as rapid as during the long postwar expansion.  </P> <P> The record for the pace of investment was at least as bad.  </P> <P> The average rate of growth of the real net productive capital stock, a measure  of how much we're expanding our productive stock of plant and equipment over  time, reached 4.4% a year in the Vietnam-fueled 1966-73 cycle, dropped to 3.5%  in 1973-79 and dropped again to 2.7% in the Reagan cycle. Should we rank this  the best business cycle in history if its pace of accumulation averaged only  60% of the rate achieved during the postwar expansion?  </P> <P> Perhaps these comparisons are unfair. Perhaps the global economic climate  during the 1980s inexorably condemned any individual country to relative  economic torpor when compared to its own past. We might therefore compare the  U.S. economy during the 1980s to the six other largest advanced capitalist  economies: Japan, West Germany, France, Italy, the United Kingdom and Canada.  The conservatives promised to revive productivity growth in the United States.  But if we look at comparative rates of productivity growth from 1979 to 1988,  the United States ranked seventh among the largest capitalist economies. Dead  last.  </P> <P> The conservatives also promised to rev up investment to fuel our engines of  growth. But if we look at the economy's relative investment performance,  comparing the share of gross domestic product going into gross non-residential  investment, the U.S. economy again limps across the finish line behind all six  of the others.  </P> <P> In short, judged on either of these two tests, the U.S. economy during the  1980s flunks decisively.  </P> <P> I don't call this the "greatest economic expansion the world has ever seen." I  call it a limp and faltering economy in need of immediate rescue from the  ravages of right-wing economic policies.  </P></p>

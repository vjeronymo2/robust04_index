			<p><P> July 8, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: CAMPO  </P> <P> The East County fire that blazed for more than two days was finally doused by 8  a.m. Friday, authorities said.  </P> <P> About 80 firefighters mopped up throughout the afternoon Friday were sent home  at about 5 p.m., said Chris Hess, a dispatcher with the California Department  of Forestry.  </P> <P> About 1,000 firefighters battled the blaze at its peak. Erratic winds in rugged  terrain that made it difficult to fight the blaze Thursday "went the right way"  early Friday, Hess said. "It wasn't as hot and the winds changed."  </P> <P> More than 1,150 acres of brushland were scorched, though no homes were burned,  Hess said. Seven firefighters suffered minor injuries.  </P></p>

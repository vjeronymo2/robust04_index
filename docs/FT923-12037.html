			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: UK economy Yesterday's UK money supply figures were not quite as inauspicious as the behaviour of the equity market might suggest. At Pounds 2.5bn in June, M4 sterling lending was running some Pounds 300m above its average over the past six months. That helps offset some of the disappointment in the largest monthly drop in M0 since 1981. Separate figures from the British Bankers' Association also suggest a degree of buoyancy in clearing bank lending. If not yet consistent with strong recovery, that hardly points to triple-dip recession. There is one caveat. Consumer borrowing remains exceptionally weak. Though lending for house purchases has risen since March, new loans are lower than a year ago. Increased activity in the leasing sector suggests manufacturers may not entirely have given up hope. That will not last unless consumer demand picks up.</p>

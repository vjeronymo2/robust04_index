Aliyev's first official visit to Ankara has a hectic  schedule, which includes his receiving an honorary degree on  international law from Hacettepe University.    While in Turkey, Aliyev will sign various economic accords  including a protocol to establish a working committee to assess  existing border accords and explore the possibilities of signing  a new agreement in this area.    The last accord, signed in 1921 between Turkey and the  ex-Soviet Union, gives Turkey the right of guarantee over the  status of Nakhichevan, an Azeri enclave in Armenia bordering  Turkey and Iran.    Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Turkish and  Azeri officials said in the past that such an accord was under  consideration, but took no steps toward formulating one until  recently.    Diplomatic sources said the working groups will work on  various drafts as well as the "right time" for signing such an  accord.    Various Turkish officials have said in the past that "Turkey  could not stand back and watch in case of an Armenian attack on  Nakhichevan."    The presence of Shamsaddin Khanbabayev, the president of the  Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic, indicates that the issue will  have priority in the talks in Ankara.    Other issues of priority, diplomatic sources have said, is  Turkish aid to Azerbaijan and the diplomatic support it can  extend in stopping Armenian violation of Azeri territory.  President Suleyman Demirel, who brushed aside protocol to meet  Aliyev at the airport, said Turkey considered the "Minsk  mechanism" as the appropriate forum to solve the Azeri-Armenian  problem.    The so called "Minsk group" operates within the context of  the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe [CSCE] and  has been seeking a settlement to the Azeri-Armenian conflict.  "I believe the problems of Azeris can be solved in a just way  which guarantees Azeri territorial integrity," Demirel said.    He added that Ankara would continue to support Azerbaijan in  international fora on this issue.    "But we will not stop at that," the Turkish president said.    "When Azerbaijan, as a democratic state, launches its  reconstruction, Turkey will continue to be of assistance with  all its means.'    Aliyev, in turn, expressed his confidence in the CSCE's  efforts for ending the Azeri-Armenian conflict.    "We have confidence in the Minsk group. We also have  confidence in the efforts of major states," Aliyev said. A  high-level Turkish diplomat interpreted these words as a sign  that Azerbaijan wants the tripartite peace plan--put forward by  Turkey, Russia and U.S.--to be brought back to the table.    "The plan, which stipulates a ceasefire and Armenian  withdrawal from Azeri lands, has long been kept on hold. but  the Azeris, worried that a sole Russian initiative would  legitimize Armenia's gains, want this or similar initiatives to  complement the Minsk process," the diplomat said.  <H5>  Turkey To Approach Aliyev on Human Rights </H5>   Meanwhile, Turkey will reportedly stress the importance it  places on human rights and democratic developments in Azerbaijan  during the talks headed by the two presidents. Turkish  diplomatic sources have indicated that Turkey feels the jailing  of former political leaders and closing down newspapers does not  reflect a good image for Baku government.    The issue of human rights violations in Azerbaijan had  reportedly been put to the Turkish government "at various  levels" by a Popular [People's] Front delegation which visited  Turkey right before Aliyev.    In a move to protest Aliyev's policies, the Azerbaijan  Cultural Association refused to meet him during his visit to  Turkey although a meeting had been scheduled for this morning.  Turkish and Azeri officials have said that "all aspects of ties  and regional problems" would be discussed in the talks.    But Aliyev's opening remarks that "Azerbaijan was in the  process of establishing its own national army to drive the  Armenian aggressors out" indicated that possible Turkish  assistance in military training would be high on the Azeri  agenda.    Ankara has been involved in the training of Azeri officers  both in Turkey and in Azerbaijan.    Aliyev, who will address the Turkish parliament today, is  expected to appeal to Turkey for support in ending the Armenian  occupation of Azeri soil.    The 160 member delegation, which arrived in Ankara's  Esenboga  Airport in two planes, also includes the head of the Azeri oil  company SOCAR, which is part of a consortium for an Azeri oil  pipeline project which includes the Turkish pipeline company  BOTAS.    Turkish officials indicated before the visit that they saw  talks with Aliyev as a "good opportunity" to reassess the  pipeline project which had been dormant for a while due to  Azerbaijan's domestic problems.    The presence of BOTAS chairman Hayrettin Uzun in the  official  talks indicated that the pipeline would be discussed. Aliyev  has recently told Amaco, the American Oil Company in the same  consortium, that the Azeri parliament will make a decision on  the route of the pipeline by March.    Ankara wants the Azeri oil to be brought with pipeline via  Turkey to the Mediterranean coast and exported to Europe from  there.</p>

			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Woman in the News: Survivor in turbulent seas - Colette Bowe In an industry where aggressive sales pitches - to the regulators as well as to customers - are a fact of life, Ms Colette Bowe, chief executive of the Personal Investment Authority, is earning a reputation for toughness. 'She can stand up to the big boys,' says a colleague on the PIA. When planning was under way for the embryonic authority, the regulatory organisation to oversee retail financial services, Mr Mick Newmarch, chief executive of Prudential, the UK's largest life insurer, launched a bitter attack on the proposals. Last summer he called for a full-blown statutory system of regulation. Ms Bowe kept quiet at the time. Even now, it is only through a colleague that the degree to which she was 'pretty fed up' has emerged. Then, Ms Bowe was in charge of retail financial services at the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog and the PIA's parent regulator. She moved to her present post in January when it was still not clear whether the dispute over the composition and role of the PIA would result in it being stillborn. There was agreement among the industry's practitioners that a single regulatory organisation was needed to replace Lautro and Fimbra, which oversee life insurance companies and independent financial advisers respectively. But for months the PIA had been dogged by a series of setbacks. Its chairman, Sir Gordon Downey, had departed abruptly last autumn amid complaints about lack of progress. And there was a seemingly endless debate about the form of regulation and the standards of selling which should be applied throughout the industry. Now the mood seems to have changed a little. Standard Life, a leading UK insurer, said this week that despite its preference for a statutory system, it was likely to join the PIA. Criticism has subsided in the wake of the authority's prospectus, released this week, which has contributed to a grudging acceptance that the PIA will come into being this summer. This shift in attitude can be partly attributed to Ms Bowe's appointment. She is both a symbol and a cause of the PIA's new-found confidence. 'The difference in staff morale has been tremendous,' said one PIA board member. Industry insiders believe she would not have joined a sinking ship, but they also acknowledge that her managerial skills have helped to put the ship on the right course. Her talent for political survival was honed the hard way, as chief press secretary at the Department of Trade and Industry during the 1986 Westland affair. The row over the future of the UK helicopter company led two cabinet ministers - her boss Sir Leon Brittan and Mr Michael Heseltine, then defence secretary - to resign and almost caused the downfall of Mrs Margaret Thatcher. Ms Bowe played a starring role. She leaked to the Press Association news group the extracts of a letter from the solicitor-general, which appeared to support the DTI argument for allowing Westland to link up with Sikorsky of the US. Mr Heseltine on the other hand wanted to find a European solution for Westland. Ms Bowe, although cleared by a Commons select committee inquiry of any wrongdoing in leaking the letter, stayed only about a year at the DTI, given the ensuing sour atmosphere at Westminster. So sensitive is the issue that even now she will not talk about it - she will not even discuss why she will not talk about it. In 1987, aged 40, she was headhunted to join the Independent Broadcasting Authority, the commercial television watchdog, as director of information. Two years later - with the fortuitous timing that has become a hallmark of her career - she was headhunted again, by the SIB. Her job combined a public affairs function with a regulatory role dealing with investment management. A week after her move was announced, the government proposed abolishing the IBA, and replacing it with the Independent Television Commission. At the SIB, which was in a formative period, Ms Bowe found herself implementing the financial services legislation which had been one of the main concerns of the DTI while she was press secretary. Her civil service training of serving different political masters proved useful. She prospered under the contrasting regimes operated by Sir David Walker, SIB chairman until 1992, and Mr Andrew Large, his successor. For much of Sir David's time, the SIB concentrated on rewriting rules for an industry which the regulators thought was made up mainly of 'good guys'. Mr Large's approach has been more sceptical and probing, scrutinising areas previously left relatively untouched, such as the suspect sale of personal pensions. At the PIA Ms Bowe will have more scope for setting her own agenda. One former colleague who admires her as an administrator expresses some concern about her attitude towards investor protection. 'She was at the SIB arguing against the Office of Fair Trading proposals to make sales agents disclose their commission,' he recalls. Ms Bowe's response to the debate about statutory versus self-regulation for the industry is instructive in its pragmatism. 'The question I ask,' she says, 'is not whether it's statutory or self - but whether it's effective regulation.' She knows the Treasury and the SIB - her ultimate masters - see it as her job to deliver effective investor protection, and it is unlikely she would have taken on the role had she felt it was impossible. Given her timely exit from her earlier job at the IBA, Ms Bowe's erstwhile SIB colleagues should perhaps be rather nervous. For one suggestion being floated by some financial services practitioners is to scrap the SIB and run single-tier regulation through the PIA alone. That is an unlikely outcome but before the PIA could conceive of becoming as powerful as the SIB, it first has to start work. Arousing enthusiasm rather than resigned acceptance in the industry is a priority. Ms Bowe must become chief cheerleader.</p>

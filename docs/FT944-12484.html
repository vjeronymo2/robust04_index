			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / International Company News: Japan's paper groups mixed Japan's leading paper manufacturers continued to suffer from cuts in paper prices due to stagnant demand, but restructuring and cost-cutting efforts at the top two companies lifted earnings at the current level. Benefits from mergers boosted interim profits at Nippon Paper Industries and New Oji Paper. New Oji was created through a merger between Oji Paper and Kanzaki Paper in October last year, while Jujo Paper and Sanyo-Kokusaku Pulp merged to form Nippon Paper in April last year. Earnings were also helped by a fall in import raw material costs due to the strong yen. Sales for the industry declined in spite of a rise in sales volumes due to sluggish product prices. Nippon Paper, however, said unconsolidated after-tax profits fell 26 per cent to Y4bn (Dollars 41.1m) as income from securities sales fell to Y300m. Daishowa Paper, which is currently undergoing financial restructuring from the mounting losses on stock and real estate investments, managed to reduce losses at the recurring level - before extraordinary items and tax - from Y11.4bn last year. It reduced operating costs by Y2bn for the first half and cut interest bearing debts by Y11.5bn from last March to Y423.1bn. Honshu Paper blamed its profits decline on falling paperboard prices. After-tax profits, however, rose 2.6 per cent to Y1.4bn due to a fall in depreciation costs. For the full year to next March, the companies are expected to see a rise in sales in tandem with the rise in industrial production and hikes of paper prices. Nippon Paper revised up its unconsolidated earnings forecast for the full year and now expects a 21 per cent rise in recurring profits to Y11.5bn on a 2.1 per cent increase in sales to Y640bn. New Oji expects a 43.8 per cent rise in recurring earnings to Y15.1bn on a 12 per cent sales increase to Y545.3bn, while Daishowa sees a recurring loss of Y12.8bn on a 3.2 per cent rise in sales to Y284bn. Honshu sees current earnings falling 13.9 per cent to Y6.8bn and sales declining 0.6 per cent to Y366.6bn.  --------------------------------------------------------------                    1994 INTERIM RESULTS (YBN)  -------------------------------------------------------------- Company            Sales   Change on    Recurring   Change on                             year (%)    profits**    year (%)  -------------------------------------------------------------- Nippon Paper       316.2     -0.7          5.6        +39.8 New Oji Paper      270.3    +25.1          6.6        +31.6 Honshu Paper       182.2     -2.0          3.2        -11.2 Daishowa Paper     141.3     -2.4         -6.9            -  -------------------------------------------------------------- ** before extraordinary items and tax  -------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Company reports  --------------------------------------------------------------</p>

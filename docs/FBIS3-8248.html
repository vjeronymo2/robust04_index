			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Janos Deak, newly appointed commander of the </F> Hungarian Army, by Andras Peto; place and date not given: "Our  Eyes Were Opened Too Late"]    [Text] [Peto] It seems that since the beginning of last  week the world has again become bipolar: International  conflicts cannot be settled without Russia. Will all this  affect Hungary's military role in the Yugoslav crisis?    [Deak] Russia has always been and will continue to be a  great military power. We soldiers can only rejoice that the air  attack in Bosnia failed to materialize and that the two  previously opposing great military powers are now engaged in  dialogue. This has also been noticeable from a military  viewpoint lately and it has perhaps contributed to easing the  Yugoslav tension. Our crisis prevention and crisis management  concepts were approved by our prime minister and president at  the end of 1991, and at the end of 1993, starting with the  defense law and the constitutional modifications, the president  again approved the concepts presented by Prime Minister Boross.  The essence of our concept is that the Hungarian Republic  should stay away from the Yugoslav conflict. Such a position  was reaffirmed after Yugoslav bombs were dropped at Barcs in  November 1991. Since then, we have maintained a steady,  correct, but distanced contact with both the Yugoslav and  Croatian military leadership; we do not yet have Bosnian  contacts. The most tense period was perhaps the second half of  1991 and the first half of 1992, when we had to apply a larger  number of troops and expenses to strengthen our air defense and  to deploy radar units. There is no direct threat on our borders  now. Until the the NATO deadline expired, we strengthened our  preparedness. Our air force units are on constant alert, and we  can even increase this alert in tenser periods by increasing the  level of combat readiness of one or two aircraft. Regarding our  ground forces we will strengthen the surveillance units and  services at some bases if necessary, and we will increase the  efficiency of leadership; this means that, if necessary, we will  keep the individual operational groups within individual  headquarters. Obviously, it is important to have cooperation  and contacts with the countries in question, including  Yugoslavia.    [Peto] Would the Hungarian military approach to the Yugoslav  crisis have been different if NATO had shown greater readiness  to accept the Hungarian request to join the organization?    [Deak] This is a political question, not a military one.  From a military viewpoint, we can only advise our state leaders  to proceed from the interests of our small country.    [Peto] In one of your recent statements you said that the  Hungarian officers are not leftist in their political  orientation. How can one draw this conclusion in the Hungarian  Army, which is so sensitive about its apolitical character?    [Deak] In accordance with the new defense law, the officer  corps of the Hungarian Army cannot carry out party policy  activity, and officers cannot be members of a political party.  This was the desire of most of our officers. The Hungarian  officers are neither leftist nor rightist in orientation; they  are Hungarian military officers. Regarding the composition of  our officer corps, it is quite different from the eight or 10  years ago. At the moment, there are 13,500 officers serving in  the Hungarian Army; some 5,500 have retired, moved into the  reserves, or taken up a different job since the change of  regime. There has been a complete change of personnel in army  headquarters, and the heads of main army groups and heads of  army groups today are people who did not serve in these  positions before 1989. Among the middle-level commanding  officers, no one served as army corps commander or brigadier  general before. And some of the old political officers left the  army and some of them are working in various professional  positions. The lieutenants and first lieutenants who are coming  into the service now began their military studies in 1989. I do  not even want to know who means what by leftist or rightist; it  is pointless to deal with this issue in the army. I do not  believe that our officers think about their political  affiliations. It is another matter that the officers are rather  sensitive socially. This is understandable when you consider  that a lieutenant's pay is about 17,000-18,000 forints.    [Peto] However, many people think that the Hungarian army  officers have been given a strong ideological training.    [Deak] One can make someone hate ideology through training.  Otto Habsburg said that he has travelled a lot throughout the  world and when he met an anti-Soviet man in Africa, the man  probably graduated from Lumumba University in Moscow; if someone  does not like the Americans, he probably studied in America.  Besides, the number of hours dedicated to the study of  Marxism-Leninism at the military academies fell well short of  the number of similar hours in the civilian universities. In my  opinion, most officers have always served in the army because  they liked being soldiers, and party membership was almost an  automatic prerequisite for this job. That time is past. We  did not know the situation and we did not have information. If  I want to describe things simply and shortly, I must say that  our eyes were opened too late. We lived in isolation, in army  barracks and in housing developments, and we read the official  newspapers; people who had a different television aerial and  could watch a different program came under special surveillance.  After all, everyone made sure they kept the rules of the game if  they wanted to stay in the army.    [Peto] In 1989 the army was separated from the Defense  Ministry in order to formalize its apolitical character. With  the new defense law, this situation has been practically  reversed: the defense minister has the right to give orders to  the army commander. And the minister has just become a party  chairman and the Defense Ministry public administration state  secretary is also the military expert of the same party; and the  same party, the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF], provides the  political secretary too. One cannot exclude the possibility  that, after the elections, the Defense Ministry will come under  similarly strong control of another party. Do you think that,  by this, the army has become an instrument of party interests  and its character as a national institution has ceased?    [Deak] We are completely independent of the parties, and  we want to stay independent. I must say that the separation of  the Defense Ministry and Army Headquarters in 1989 was done in a  very brutal way. A lot of administrative and ministerial tasks  remained with army headquarters. On the basis of the new  defense law, the army is controlled from various sides: the  president of the republic, Parliament, the government, and the  minister. Without going into detail, I must conclude that the  authority of both president and Parliament has become stronger.  As he himself used to say, on entering the ministry building,  the minister ceases to be a party man, and the army commander  continues to have his former authority. The army is led by its  commander. The ruling defense minister can only give orders to  the army commander, and he can only ask for a report from the  army commander. Any order has legal consequences, and this  means that an order can only be issued on something that has  legal conditions. The essential thing is that the defense  minister manages his ministry on the basis of the law and  regulations; he must accept responsibility for the budget and  supplying the army, and he must supervise distribution and  consumption; the ministry is also the army's legal  representative, but the minister is not a commander. This is  the difference compared with the old ways. The administrative  state secretary cannot have any control whatever over the army  and its headquarters.    [Peto] In any case, regarding the legal status of the state  secretaries, the law says that the professional activity of the  ministry is directed by the administrative state secretary,  although some of the military leadership's tasks have been  placed under the ministry's control.    [Deak] The Defense Ministry will most probably be a special  ministry. The bloc within the ministry that will make up the  country's actual military leadership will have to fulfill at  least three tasks, namely to coordinate the military  professional parts of the ministry, carry out the classic  strategic and tactical planning activities of headquarters, and  operate as a military command. The aforementioned tasks of the  state secretary cannot apply to the military bloc in the  ministry.    [Peto] At your parliamentary hearing, you said that it was  not a good idea to include elements of an economic organization  in the defense budget. What do you think would be the right  thing, and what can be done with the funds available?    [Deak] We are in a very difficult situation. For us to be  free of economic difficulties, our budget would neet to be a few  billion forints bigger. The budget envisages a compulsory  income of 8 billion forints for us, but presumably we will not  be able to fulfill this because no one wants to buy our deserted  barracks and we have no weapons to sell.    [Peto] Thinking of the Lupis [investment] scandal, the  circulation of money does not seem to be a definitely military  virtue.    [Deak] The army should definitely keep away from such  activity. Even if it happens at other ministries, the Hungarian  Army should not be obliged to generate income. The budget  should cover our expenses! Maintaining the technical level of  our equipment is at least as important as providing housing,  clothing, food, and training for our soldiers. Without the  latter, lives could be endangered. We have often declared our  priorities: air defense, leadership, reconnaissance, and  electronic warfare. In addition, we have tasks originating from  the recent partnership for peace program and peacekeeping  activities. According to the new budget, we can spend 160-170  forints a day on food, but the soldiers have to be housed and  given books to read, television to watch and tape recorders, as  well as training. One cannot stress enough the importance of  training, and all this costs a lot of money. For example, this  year we cannot take our aircraft to the Baltic Sea to shoot live  ammunition because we do not have the necessary 200 million  forints. For example, a small portable air-defense missile  costs 800,000 forints. Of course, it would be cheaper to train  on simulators in the long run, but these simulators also have to  be purchased, and they are very expensive too. A tank simulator  costs 30 million forints, and an anti-armor missile costs more  than 100,000 forints. But let me not only complain: A pilot  flies 80 hours a year, and this is more than in any country in  our neighborhood; we are training the MIG-20 squadron and  placing it in operation; we carry out subunit exercises with  live ammunition too; and we are continuing to train of  commanders. I find the battalion- level exercises very  important, but all this costs a lot of money and we are using  our reserves. As the State Auditing Office showed us, we must  reexamine our budget and administrative systems. Besides, any  activity that has no connection with military life is quite  alien to me. In any case, I hope the recent financial affair  was a big lesson, and the consequences must be born by the  relevant people.</p>

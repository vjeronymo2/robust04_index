			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by M. Paye'dar: "Beijing-Tehran: The Need for </F> Cooperation"]    [Excerpts] PRC Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, who is also  the deputy prime minister, arrived in Tehran on an official  visit yesterday. Qian Qichen, who is the second in command in  the massive political apparatus of the PRC after Jiang Zemin,  was quoted as saying on the eve of his visit that Iran is the  most important country in West Asia, and in particular, in the  Persian Gulf region.    He said: The PRC believes that Iran can play an immensely  important role in the preservation of peace and stability in the  Persian Gulf region. Qian Qichen cited the volume of trade  between the two countries as $710 million in 1993 and added that  this is the greatest trade volume between Iran and the PRC in  the history their relations. Beijing is quite satisfied with  this trend of expansion.    Commenting on the critical situation in the region, the PRC  foreign minister said: Reports indicate that the sale of  weapons to this region by some of the bigger countries in the  aftermath of the Persian Gulf war are valued at billions of  dollars. The PRC believes that the sale of arms to the region  is certainly not in the interest of peace and stability. He  said that he hoped that the countries exporting the weapons will  adopt a policy of restraint in order to preserve the peace and  stability in the region. [passage omitted]    The importance of PRC-Iran cooperation is obvious to anyone  but it may be claimed that there has not been much attention to  this matter. Even though in the past, there have been many  visits and trips by numerous high-level officials, it appears  that the level of bilateral relations has not changed  qualitatively to attain what could be described as a new  regional equilibrium.    Regardless of the reason for such a state of affairs,  allowing it to continue in the face of the new international  connotations of power and security that have emerged in the  contemporary world does not seem logical. It is therefore not  very effective to use the traditional lever of bilateral  cooperation in all fields, and this in itself dictates the need  for new parameters [preceding word in English] and a new  atmosphere in their bilateral diplomacy.    Iran as well as the PRC enjoy special political importance  within their respective geographical areas, even though this  importance is not of uniform in regional and international  affairs. However, both countries, in their own right influence  that transcends their own political boundaries.    In any case, this importance has provided ample and logical  reasons for Beijing and Tehran to deepen, expand, and revamp  multilateral cooperation between them. This is significant for  the following two reasons:    1. Beijing's expectations of Iran's role in the region and  the direction that it envisages in this regard.    2. Iran's view of the PRC as a political power and a future  economic power.    Regarding the first factor, as Qian Qichen stated, a country  such as Iran cannot be ignored and the broadening of cooperation  with Iran enjoys high priority. However, as for the areas of  this cooperation, Qian Qichen implied the following:    1. Iran's importance lies in the Persian Gulf.    2. The expansion of economic cooperation and transfer of  technical know how.    3. Military cooperation.    4. Beijing's willingness to cooperate with Tehran,  especially in broadening the role of the Economic Cooperation  Organization [ECO] and restructuring it.    Of course, the importance of Iran's role in the Persian Gulf  is clear to all and Beijing is also completely aware that Iran's  perception of the way the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman should  be administered plays a fundamental role in promoting stability  in the region.    In any case, the emergence of any kind of insecurity in the  Persian Gulf--in view of the enormous investment by the PRC in  the region, especially in the latter half of the 1980's--will be  an immense source of concern for the PRC. The Persian Gulf war  and the concomitant economic losses sustained by the PRC are  still fresh in the minds of the PRC leaders. The huge sums  (totally borne by the regional Arab countries) spent on  beginning and ending the war and eliminating its consequences  resulted in the suspension of all industrial and developmental  projects in the region. The PRC also suffered massive losses,  as the foreign demand for its goods was greatly reduced. The  difference was that when the war ended--in view of the nature of  the forces embroiled in the war, and the importance that the  Arab governments attach to Western countries--Beijing did not  get a piece of the cake, or more accurately, they were not  allowed to have any.    This is why the PRC is pursuing its objectives in a totally  different way than the Arab governments and why it considers  Iran's role extremely important in attaining its objectives.  Stability is the "elixir of life" for both countries and this  is the best reason for mutual cooperation. [passage omitted]    The current trend, which lacks the desirable trend and  volume, cannot be defended. It appears that most of Iran's  imports are manufactured goods, which is not in keeping with the  economic development program of the government, while the PRC's  imports from Iran mainly consist of crude oil. This is the  situation even though the Chinese have valuable experience in  the fields of power generation, nuclear reactors for civilian  use, light industries that generate employment, geological  prospecting, building refineries, textiles, shipbuilding, port  construction, airplane manufacture, agriculture, engineering,  and urban construction. This expertise can be transferred to  Iran if we do some intensive planning in this regard.    As for cooperation in the military field, the experts should  give their views. Here, only one point can be mentioned and  that is: The Chinese have made immense advances in the  manufacture of defensive weapons; and the not so complex  technology of Chinese weapons (of course as compared to Western  weapons) is capable of being absorbed into Iran's defense system.    On the subject of cooperation with the ECO, to which Qian  Qichen alluded, the PRC sees it in the perspective of Iran and  Pakistan, but Iran is more important. The situation was  different prior to the dissolution of the Soviet Union, but now  Iran has common borders with some Central Asian countries that  are eager to broaden their relations with Iran. Therefore, the  Chinese are watching the ECO closely, as it should naturally  culminate in expanding Iran's role. In addition, the  establishment of a unified economic front stretching from Turkey  to the northern and western borders of the PRC has immense  economic and political importance to that country. This is  especially so because most of these countries view the PRC as an  independent politico-economic power which--after the collapse of  the Soviet Union--will have the last word in Asia.    However, Tehran's vantage point is totally different from  that of Beijing and is extremely strategic. In view of the  international military structure, the perception that the PRC is  a durable regional and international politico-economic force is  gaining ground among Iranian leaders. Facts and figures  indicate that this perception is very realistic. Beijing is a  relatively independent force on the international political and  economic scene and its model of national expansion has drawn the  attention of many Third World countries.    On the international diplomatic scene, the PRC is the sole  Asian member of the Security Council and can be of great  importance to many countries in view of the largely Western  composition of the Security Council.    In the economic field, the PRC can finish numerous  uncompleted projects in Iran and can also make new investments,  especially in the field of energy production. In this regard  there appears to be only one obstacle, to which the PRC leaders  should find a solution.    Unfortunately, it appears that in regard to the peace trend  in the Middle East, the PRC has not adopted an independent stand  and has ignored the overall interests of the Arab countries and  Muslims of the region for the sake of Israel. Even though the  traitorous talks on the Gaza-Jericho accord were in progress,  the PRC restored ties with Israel and high-level delegations  have been exchanged between the two countries. The Iranian  officials should discuss this matter in their talks with the PRC  leaders and should ask the PRC to take a more logical stance  toward this negative phenomenon, in view of the Zionists' evil  deeds.</p>

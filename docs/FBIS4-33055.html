			<p>BFN     [Text] Caracas, 28 May (EFE) -- The Venezuelan Government  has put an end to the uncertainty surrounding the future of  state-owned power companies by announcing today that, starting  in September, these companies will be privatized.    Eduardo Calero, manager of the electrical sector of the  Venezuelan Investment Fund (FIV), said that initially the  Central Plant and Enelven-Enelco [expansion unknown] companies  will be auctioned, and in early 1995 the process will continue  with the privatization of two other regional companies.    The transfer of the power companies to the private sector  has  been planned for over four years, but during that period various  factors emerged--most of them political--which prevented the  process from materializing.    According to Calero, the government no longer considers  privatization as a means of reducing the size of government but  as "an immediate financial necessity," prompted by the acute  economic crisis the country is experiencing, which has become  worse because of the accelerated devaluation of the national  currency.    The FIV official also announced that within the short term  power rates will be revised because companies in the region have  been seriously affected by the devaluation of the Venezuelan  bolivar with regard to the U.S. dollar.    Products, imported raw materials, and the payment of debts  abroad now pose a considerable problem for the power companies,  which must pay their commitments in dollars, while their rates  are fixed in a currency that has been devaluated by 30 percent  over the past two months, Calero said.    In any event, he explained, the cost of the devaluation will  not be directly transferred to the rates; instead, he said, "the  increase in rates will depend on the extent to which each power  company is willing to assume part of the expense caused by the  weakening of Venezuela's currency."</p>

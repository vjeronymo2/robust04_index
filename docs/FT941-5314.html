			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / Equity Markets: Investors gripped by inflation fever - New York Having survived Friday's nerve-wracking release of the February employment report unscathed, the stock market faces a quiet week, with nothing on the economic agenda to match the import of the monthly jobs figures. Awaiting the employment data was nerve-wracking because both the bond and stock markets feared that if the figures had come in above forecasts, the Federal Reserve would have quickly pushed up interest rates again in an attempt to dampen inflationary pressures in the increasingly buoyant economy. In the event, the report was mixed, and the feared rate increase never materialised, allowing share prices to end the week on a positive note. Ironically, the fuss over whether the Fed would follow a strong employment report by raising rates diverted attention from the fact that the February jobs figures were bullish for stocks. They were neither so buoyant as to raise fears of an overheated economy, nor so weak as to revive concern about the state of the labour market. This good news was mostly overlooked because the stock market has caught a bad case of the bond market's inflation fever. In recent weeks the slightest hint of rising prices - in a purchasing managers' report, say, or a regional Fed survey - has spooked fixed-income investors and pushed up long-term interest rates and depressed share prices. While concerns about inflation appear overdone (few economists can find any real evidence of rising prices in the economy at the moment), the stock market is right to be worried by the sight of rising long-term interest rates. This is because, as Mr William Dodge, Dean Witter's chief economist points out in this week's equity research note, the stock market has moved from an interest rate-driven phase in the cycle to an earnings-driven phase. If interest rates continue to rise, they will eventually inflict some damage on the economy. Weaker economic growth can only lead to weaker corporate earnings growth. Or, as Mr Dodge puts it: 'If interest rates do not fall, the tug-of-war between rising earnings and higher interest rates will begin in earnest from current stock market levels. And if interest rates slow the economy while remaining high, the earnings underpinning will be pulled out from under the market.' Fortunately, bond prices performed remarkably well on Friday, and interest rates actually ended the day slightly lower. Some observers hope that this resilient display marks a turning point of some kind for the bond market. The end, perhaps, of weeks of jittery, panicky trading. If they are right, then the stock market should enjoy a welcome respite from the recent turmoil that has unsettled financial markets in the US and Europe. It helps that there is little important economic news due this week that might unnerve investors. The main events are Wednesday's publication of the Fed's 'Beige Book' report on the economy, and Friday's release of February retail sales data.</p>

			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Government Bonds: Bunds ease as bank dismays with minimum repo cut THE Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, announced the smallest possible cut in the repo rate yesterday, and bunds slipped back as a long-suffering market registered its irritation. Bund futures for September eased 0.07 to 95.04. The bund market had already lost hope of an imminent cut in key interest rates because of the combination of continued strength of the dollar, relatively high money supply growth, and the announcement that the repo would be at a variable rate. When the Bundesbank announced it was reducing the repo rate by one basis point to 7.59 per cent, one analyst described the move as the 'worst of both worlds'. Investors are now concentrating on forthcoming regional inflation data, the first of which could be announced tomorrow. Opportunities to look for clues on the interest rate front from the next repo rate announcement will be limited because it will come on a Thursday rather than a Wednesday. This is to avoid its release on the last day of the month. Consequently, it will come just before the next Bundesbank Council meeting. FRENCH government bonds rallied yesterday and the yield spread over German 10-year bonds closed below 10 basis points for the first time. The country's government bond market is not expected to be affected by France's new FFr40bn four-year government bond, targeted primarily at private savings currently in money market funds. September futures on the Matif settled higher at 119.36, and underlying 10-year bonds rose 0.12 to 111.89. THE UK government bond market recovered from the latest bond auction announcement, although dealers said earlier weakness had largely been a knee-jerk reaction. The Bank of England is to auction Pounds 3.25bn of stock on June 30. Although some dealers feel the amount is on the high side, the 10-year maturity and the coupon are attractive to overseas investors, owing to their FOTRA - or tax exempt for foreigners - status. The yield curve flattened as recent evidence of non-inflationary growth continued to persuade investors to switch to the long end. The benchmark 9 per cent Treasury stock due 2008 jumped  9/32 to end at 107. At the short end, five-year gilts ended  1/32 up at 101 3/16 . IN SPITE of disappointment that the Bank of Spain failed to cut the repo rate, government bond prices held firm. Economists had anticipated a quarter percentage point reduction in the key lending rate, but it was left at 11.25 per cent. A reduction in the daily lending rate of 0.23 point to 11.32 per cent failed to make up for the disappointment. However, September Bono futures traded in Barcelona lifted a quarter point to 93.55. JAPANESE government bonds held up well following a Y800bn auction of 10-year bonds with a 4.7 per cent coupon. The futures contract fell back during Japanese trading, but stabilised towards the close. September yen futures slipped 0.25 point to 107.47 in Japan. ALTHOUGH prices at the short end of the US Treasury market were pressured by renewed talk of an interest rate rise, longer-dated securities held their ground following a weak durable goods report. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  1/8 at 104 9/16 , yielding 6.761 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was slightly weaker, down  3/32 at 99 27/32 , to yield 4.191 per cent. A newspaper report claiming the Federal Reserve may still be close to tightening monetary policy to curb inflation set the tone for a downbeat start to trading, with fear of higher rates depressing shorter-dated securities right from the opening. The short end was undermined by selling ahead of the afternoon auction of Dollars 11bn of five-year notes. The auction passed off uneventfully, although most of the demand appeared to come from the New York dealing community - an indication that some players were scared away by the reports of a possible Fed tightening. At the long end, however, prices edged higher, on news of an unexpected 1.6 per cent decline in May durable goods orders.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By special correspondent Shih Lei (4258 4320) from </F> Tangshan: "Pro-Democracy Activist Wang Jiaqi Flees to Hong Kong"]    [Text] Wang Jiaqi [3769 1367 3825], a prominent mainland  pro-democracy activist, escaped to Hong Kong on 15 April; he is  now being provided with daily necessities by a nongovernmental  organization in Hong Kong and is waiting for a trip to some  Western country to seek political asylum. The senior level of  the CPC is very shocked and has expressed concern about the  development of the incident.    According to an authoritative informed source, Wang Jiaqi  escaped while being escorted from Beijing to Tangshan City  Public Security Bureau. When they arrived in Tangshan, Wang  Jiaqi escaped from the control of the public security personnel  and, thereafter, was assisted by another person to flee safely  to Hong Kong.    According to sources, this pro-democracy activist, who has a  "special status," was a high official in Tangshan City Public  Security Bureau's Legal System Office. Because he had worked  for 11 years in the public security bureau and was involved in a  wide range of work, he had the opportunity to examine files  which were not known to outsiders. Therefore, the authorities  are very nervous about Wang Jiaqi's sudden escape and the  possible leak of internal files. Beijing's Public Security  Ministry has already issued notices to various localities,  demanding that they strengthen precautions and prevent similar  incidents from happening. Several days ago, Tangshan City  Public Security Bureau received a notice from the senior level  demanding a thorough investigation into the cause of the  incident. According to information, the relevant personnel will  face disciplinary action and will lose their jobs.    Information has it that Wang Jiaqi, 34, was admitted to the  graduate program at Beijing University Department of Law after  the 4 June incident. Thereafter, he and some dissident  intellectuals, such as Yuan Hongbing, were involved in  pro-democracy organizations. During the period of the "two  meetings" on the mainland, Wang Jiaqi, Yuan Hongbing, and Zhou  Guoqiang initiated an underground labor organization called the  "Labor Union." Because the organization involved more than 100  people, the authorities viewed it as "illegal" and banned it,  and several dozen of the participants, including the  abovementioned three persons, were summoned by the authorities.  Zhou Guoqiang, the lawyer representing Han Dongfang, was also  arrested by mainland public security personnel after a secret  "seven-day tour" of Hong Kong.    According to information, Wang Jiaqi was the lawyer  representing Yan Zhengxue, a deputy to Jiaojiang City People's  Congress in Zhejiang Province, in a case of conflict between the  people and the police in Beijing last September, a case which  drew widespread attention in the municipality. On 19 April, the  Eighth Meeting of the Standing Committee of the Fifth Jiaojiang  City People's Congress in Zhejiang decided that the relevant  department should educate Yan Zhengxue through labor. Wang  Jiaqi, who is now overseas, does not have the opportunity to  defend Yan.    Szeto Wah of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of the  Democratic Movement in China, said yesterday that as regards  Wang Jiaqi's arrival in Hong Kong, he was not aware of his  whereabouts.</p>

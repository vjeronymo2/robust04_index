			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by UKRINFORM correspondents Viktor Demydenko and </F> Mykhaylo Melnyk on press conference by Chairman of Ukraine's  Supreme Council Oleksandr Moroz on 30 May; place not given: "I  Am Not a Hostage to Any Specific Political Forces in the  Parliament"]    [Text] "I am not a hostage to any specific political  forces in the parliament." The chairman of Ukraine's Supreme  Council stated this on 30 May at the news conference when he  characterized the present composition of the parliament. "I  know that it will not be easy for me, but my election to the  post is an optimal variant in the given situation," Oleksandr  Moroz pointed out.    He said that the Supreme Council intends to prepare a  package  of radical measures aimed at stabilizing the economy. In his  opinion, "Ukraine must, in the near future, resolve the question  of currency regulation, remove other money from circulation  inside the state, and revise the taxation policy as well as the  utilization of credit resources." He also pointed out that "for  many people, these measures do not seem to be welcome, but there  is no other way out, if we want to overcome the crisis."    According to him, the restructuring of the economy "must be  started from the military-industrial complex," and also "with an  extensive integration with Russia." However, Oleksandr Moroz is  categorically opposed to Ukraine's joining the ruble zone.    Touching upon the issue of the state's nonnuclear status,  Oleksandr Moroz emphasized this: "The compensation for Ukraine  for the withdrawal and destruction of nuclear weapons must not  be looked upon as alms to a poor orphan, but must be the payment  for the well-being of many countries of the world." That is why  the chairman of the Supreme Council believes "assistance for  Ukraine amounting to several hundred million dollars is  humiliating for the state."    At the same time, the chairman of the Supreme Council is  sure  that the signing of the Trilateral Agreement could not be  avoided, because "Ukraine is unable to maintain nuclear  weapons." "If I had been president, I would have also signed  the agreement," said Oleksandr Moroz, "but, perhaps, I would  have also made those radical steps that would be more  advantageous for Ukraine."    Answering the question on Western investments, the Supreme  Council chairman said that "Ukraine is ready to accept them, and  our reforms will promote the influx of foreign capital." "The  essence of the reforms," he pointed out, "will be based upon  market relations regulated by the state."    "No doubt," continued the head of the parliament, "many  investors would like to know whether private ownership of land  will be introduced in Ukraine." In his opinion, land must not  become a subject of purchase or sale. It will be a crime  against the people and the future generations.</p>

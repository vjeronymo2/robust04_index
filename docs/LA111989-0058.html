			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: REVVING UP  </P> <P> Biker pictures may be roaring back onto the big screen -- with director Walter  Hill leading the pack.  </P> <P> "48 HRS. -- NOW!" will find heroes Reggie Hammond (Eddie Murphy) and Nick Cates  (Nick Nolte) returning to face bad-guy bikers led by a lean, mean dude named  Willie Hickok. An ex-con and member of the Aryan Brotherhood, Willie's got pals  who sport lots of tattoos -- as well as some nasty attitudes about women. He's  also got a little brother with 72 outstanding traffic violations as well as  several outstanding warrants for his arrest.  </P> <P> Look for plenty of gunplay and explosions -- some special cars get blown to  smithereens. Not much in the way of female characters, though there is a femme  detective who's got a thing for Jack.  </P> <P> Scripted by Jeb Stuart and John Fasano, "48 HRS. -- NOW!," begins filming early  next month in L.A. and S.F. locales. Pat H. Broeske and Kirk Honeycutt  </P></p>

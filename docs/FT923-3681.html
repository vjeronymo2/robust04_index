			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / International Company News: UCB expects growth to slow down in second half UCB, the Belgian pharmaceuticals and chemicals group, expects slower profit growth in the second half of 1992 compared with the 43 per cent rise reported yesterday for the first six months, Reuter reports from Brussels. 'The second half of the year has not taken off too badly, but prudence incites me to say that growth will not be as high as in the first half,' said Mr Georges Jacobs, UCB's chairman of the executive committee. Profits for the first half jumped to BFr1.49bn (Dollars 51.4m) from BFr1.04bn in the previous corresponding term. Net profit rose to BFr1.57bn from BFr1.01bn. The increase was due to the good performance in UCB's three sectors of activity, said Mr Jacobs. The chairman said the target date for the approval of Zyrtec in the US remained early 1993, while he hoped to get the approval in Japan in 1994. Mr Jacobs said UCB, which currently has 15 per cent of its sales outside Europe, aimed to double its non-European sales before the end of the decade.</p>

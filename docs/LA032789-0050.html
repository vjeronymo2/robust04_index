			<p><P> March 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The Republican Party, during the 1987-88 election cycle, raised and spent more  than double the amount of money taken in and spent by the Democrats, but the  gap between the two parties' financial strength was less than in 1983-84, the  Federal Election Commission said. A report issued by the commission said the  GOP raised $263.3 million and spent $257 million in 1987-88, compared to $127.9  million raised and $121.9 million spent by the Democratic Party. By contrast,  when President Ronald Reagan ran for reelection in 1983-84, the Republicans  raised a record $297.9 million and spent $300.8 million, while the Democrats  raised $98.5 million and spent $97.4 million.  </P></p>

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / UK Company News: US side helps Bemrose rise A strong performance from its US operations helped Bemrose Corporation, the printing group, report a 15 per cent increase in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 1.61m to Pounds 1.85m, for the half year to June 27. Sales rose to Pounds 22.8m (Pounds 21.5m). The group's core business of security printing in the UK continued to perform strongly on the back of term contracts. Three of the group's main cheque contracts have been renewed for three to five years, although it expects to lose orders as the banks take more work in house. Renaissance Publishing consolidated production from three to two factories and installed a new Harris Web press at a cost of almost Dollars 3m (Pounds 1.68m). Earnings per share rose to 7.14p (6.49p). The interim dividend is unchanged at 4.3p.</p>

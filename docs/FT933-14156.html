			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / International Company News: Varity wins VW brakes contract VARITY, the the Buffalo-based industrial group, has won a long-term contract, valued at more than Dollars 135m annually, to supply anti-lock braking systems to Volkswagen in Germany, Reuter reports. Varity's Kelsey-Hayes will supply its latest EBC 10 line of braking systems to Volkswagen beginning in 1996, for use in the 1997 model year. This is the third large European contract for the system won by Kelsey-Hayes since it introduced its products overseas in 1991, the company said. It predicted that Europe's anti-lock braking systems market would grow to 60 per cent of all vehicles manufactured there in 1997, compared with 25 per cent today.</p>

			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Bonn urged to reform jobs market THE chief economist of Germany's second biggest bank has called for a removal of the obstacles burdening the German labour market. Mr Klaus Friedrich, chief economist at Dresdner Bank, who was speaking in Frankfurt on Monday night, said the labour market in Germany was so encrusted with inflexibilities that it functioned as if it were not a market at all. He dismissed the tendency of German companies to put workers on to 'short-time' - whereby employees receive a government-subsidised wage even though they are no longer working - as 'macro-economic nonsense'. He reserved the same judgment for any deal between unions and employers which provided job guarantees in return for low wage increases. The powerful IG Metall union has suggested a moratorium on jobs in return for moderate wage claims. 'The only thing that matters is to have healthily functioning companies,' Mr Friedrich said. 'That means better deployment of capital, workers and management.' Such views, while undoubtedly shared by many senior German executives, are rarely voiced by consensus-minded members of the German financial and industrial establishment. They hint at pressures for Germany's 'social-market' economy to become less social and more market-oriented. Mr Friedrich, whose forthright style reflects many years working as an economist in the US before returning to take up his position at the Dresdner Bank last year, praised the measures contained in economics minister Mr Gunter Rexrodt's recently published paper on 'Securing the Future of Germany's Economic Base', which calls for privatisation and increased labour market flexibility as a cure for Germany's economic woes. 'The Rexrodt paper has its head and its heart in the right place,' said Mr Friedrich. 'But the question is, does it have the muscle? Can it be implemented in practice?' Mr Friedrich said it was obvious what had to be done in economic terms. The difficulties in implementing deregulation lay in the political arena, he said. Radical measures would be especially difficult to implement in 1994, an election year in Germany.</p>

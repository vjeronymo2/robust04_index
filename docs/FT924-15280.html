			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Germans agree plan on health reforms GERMANY'S pharmaceutical industry, doctors and dentists yesterday joined forces in opposition to a new health service reform plan, which places the brunt of sweeping subsidy cuts on their own costs. The compromise plan was thrashed out during four days of talks among health specialists from the three parties in the ruling coalition, and from the opposition Social Democrats, chaired by Mr Horst Seehofer, the health minister. The plan requires the pharmaceutical industry and the medical profession to pay for more than DM10bn (Pounds 4bn) out of a total DM11.4bn in reduced subsidies for health care from the state budget, with the balance being borne by patients. Given the cross-party support for the plan, it now seems certain to win parliamentary approval, but it is still likely to face fierce opposition from the drug manufacturers, doctors and dentists, some of whom have already staged token strikes. Dr Karsten Vilmar, president of the federal general medical council, said patients would inevitably be the losers from the savings plan. Savings of more than DM11bn would only be possible if medical services were cut by that amount, he said. He called for value added tax on medicines to be halved to help cut costs. He also sharply criticised a proposal to place a strict ceiling on the number of doctors who can register with the state subsidised medical insurance schemes. The German pharmaceutical industry association (BPI) said the compromise package represented a 'missed opportunity' for a more comprehensive reform of the health system'. Apart from strict measures to control drug prescriptions, the plan calls for a real 5 per cent cut in prices of medicines, and a two-year price freeze. A key criticism by the industry is that the limit on drug prescriptions would worsen the treatment of patients, and threaten the existence of some pharmaceutical makers. 'The pharmaceutical industry refuses to be called to account for possible excess spending on medicines,' the BPI said. In spite of the hostile reaction, a clearly delighted Mr Seehofer insisted that the hard-won political compromise was both 'effective and fair'. It will be presented to parliament and should be law before the end of the year.</p>

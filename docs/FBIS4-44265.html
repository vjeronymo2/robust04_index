"If these conditions do not exist," Berlusconi told  reporters  after a cabinet meeting, "Italy will intervene with humanitarian  action outside Rwandan territory."    An Italian peace-keeping contingent in Rwanda would involve  450 troops.    Defense Minister Cesare Previti said Italian collaboration  with France, which plans to deploy an interposition force of  2,000 troops, is possible only "within the limits of  humanitarian and logistical contributions."</p>

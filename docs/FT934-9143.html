			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / (CORRECTED) International Bonds: Dealers criticise pricing of Hydro-Quebec Pounds 200m deal Correction (published 12th November 1993) appended to this article. DESPITE a heavy flow of deals across a wide range of currencies yesterday, dealers said supply was likely to start abating soon. Among a variety of small- to medium-sized deals, Hydro-Quebec launched a Pounds 200m five-year issue via SG Warburg. Dealers said there was still appetite for sterling paper among overseas and domestic investors, particularly at the shorter end of the market. There has been a lack of supply in the five-year area, due to unattractive swap conditions, and the only issues on offer have generally provided only a small yield spread over the gilts market. However, the Hydro-Quebec deal was criticised for its aggressive pricing. The launch spread of 60 basis points over the 7 1/4 per cent gilt due 1998 was described as several basis points too tight. Although political worries about Quebec have eased, Hydro-Quebec's credit rating has slipped to A1 from Moody's and to A- from Standard and Poor's. At the end of trading, the deal was being offered at a yield spread of 62 basis points over the curve. In the Canadian dollar sector, the spate of longer-dated deals continued, with a CDollars 250m 10-year deal for Credit Local de France via IBJ International, and a 15-year deal for the European Investment Bank via Wood Gundy. Investors have been searching further along the steep Canadian bond yield curve for higher returns. Although the Credit Local deal was launched at a spread of 18 basis points over the 10-year government bond, the spread over the interpolated yield curve between 10 and 30 years was only about three basis points. Consequently, the deal was more attractive to retail investors, who like the 7 per cent coupon, than to institutional buyers. IN the Yankee bond market, Zeneca Group, the bioscience business demerged from ICI, launched its second bond issue on Tuesday. It was a Dollars 300m offering of 30-year bonds, arranged by Goldman Sachs. A Dollars 300m 10-year Yankee bond deal was completed in June. The proceeds of both deals will be used to repay the bulk of Zeneca's Dollars 850m debt to ICI, which falls due in January. The balance will be drawn from existing funds. Deutsche Bundespost, the German post office, has established a DM2bn medium-term note programme, arranged by Deutsche bank. CORRECTION HYDRO-Quebec's debt is rated A+ by Standard &amp; Poor's, not A- as stated in Thursday's paper.</p>

			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Lang move hits Scottish Nuclear Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, yesterday dealt a blow to Scottish Nuclear's commercial strategy by deferring a decision on whether to approve construction of a dry store for spent fuel at the Torness power station in East Lothian. Mr Lang said he would wait until the Department of the Environment finished the review of radioactive waste strategy announced by Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, last month. The review, which will feed into the overall nuclear review, will consider whether Britain should have a single dry store for nuclear waste or stores at individual plants. The review could delay approval for another year. Last night Mr Robin Jeffrey, chief executive of the government-owned Scottish Nuclear (SNL), called Mr Lang's announcement 'deeply disappointing'. It would set back SNL's progress towards becoming fully commercial, he said, and open up 'a totally irrelevant question'. The dry store involves keeping spent nuclear fuel on the site of a power station to let its radioactivity decline naturally rather than sending it for more expensive reprocessing to British Nuclear Fuels' Thorp plant at Sellafield, Cumbria. If SNL built dry stores at both Torness and its Hunterston plant in Ayrshire it would cut its operating costs by Pounds 45m a year. It has a target cost-reduction figure of Pounds 100m a year. SNL has indicated that the policy was favoured by the Scottish Office. SNL had hoped to begin building the Pounds 80m-Pounds 100m dry store in late summer for completion in just over two years.</p>

			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / GE jobs plan bolsters helicopter engines bid General Electric of the US is expected today to announce details of its bid to supply engines for the British army's new attack helicopter. At an airshow in Middle Wallop, Hampshire, the US power equipment and engine manufacturer will say it has teamed up with a UK partner to make the engines and will spend the equivalent value of any contract by placing work in Britain. The helicopter order is one of the most significant army equipment purchases for some years. Up to 100 new battlefield helicopters are due to be ordered early next year in a contract worth about Pounds 2bn. GE is using its alliance with European Gas Turbines, a subsidiary of GEC Alsthom, to offer its engines for two of the potential six competitors - the McDonnell Douglas Apache, which would be manufactured under licence by Westland, and the Bell Cobra, which would be made under licence by GEC-Marconi. EGT will act as prime contractor for the engines if either wins the competition. The engine contract alone could be worth Pounds 150m-Pounds 200m. To make the proposal attractive to the Ministry of Defence, GE has said that it will offset the full value of any contract placed with work in the UK. About 75 per cent of the value of the offset will provide employment and the balance would transfer technology to Britain. The Apache helicopter, while expensive, is thought to be the army's favoured choice. The estimated 1,000 Apaches and Super Cobras in service are fitted with GE's T700 engine. It is understood that Westland's bid to the MoD also specifies the T700 as the main choice. GEC agrees to buy Ferranti defence units, Page 19</p>

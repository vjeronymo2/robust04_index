			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Some careful planning in Belfast: John Murray Brown on the work behind the event opening tonight Like generals plotting a battle, the 'operations room' staff of Northern Ireland's Industrial Development Board were yesterday making final arrangements for Belfast's International Investment Conference, which Mr John Major, the prime minister, is due to open tonight. Surrounded by clocks showing the time in seven of the world's capitals they put final touches to the seating plan for tonight's opening dinner, which will be attended by Mr Ron Brown, US commerce secretary. Mr Maynard Mawhinney, director in charge of promotions at the IDB, said: 'It's not just an exercise in putting bums on seats. It's about sensitivities. Imagine you put two competitors on the same table. And if you do, is that a problem?' The conference is described as the biggest and most extravagant corporate event in Northern Ireland's recent history. About 250 delegates are expected, including executives from 70 businesses from the rest of Europe, the US and the far east. Given that the conference was only announced in October, the IDB is pleased with the turnout. Mr Mawhinney said: 'Germany would normally be our target market in Europe. But December is an impossible month. German companies are all holding their AGMs.' The venue for the conference is the Europa hotel. Mr Billy Hastings, head of the eponymous Ulster company which acquired the Europa from Stoy Hayward, the administrators, 15 months ago, said: 'If Northern Ireland can turn itself around as quickly as we did, things will really be happening.' The hotel, which used to be sealed off like a fortress, was bombed more than 40 times in the 25 years of violence. On the last occasion Mr Hastings was still in negotiations with the administrators. After a Pounds 6.5m refurbishment it is a potent reminder of the change that peace can bring to the city. 'We were doing a function here the last time a bomb went off,' said Ms Claire Faulkner, whose company Project Planning has been contracted to devise the conference. 'We then didn't know whether it was just a matter of sweeping up glass, or something more serious.' The real challenge on this occasion has been to get the conference ready on time. For an event of this size, the IDB would normally have sought commercial sponsorship. On this occasion there was just not time. At the weekend, replies were still coming in from businesses around the world. 'We have one person whose sole task is to cope with the late replies,' said Ms Faulkner. Delegates coming from Heathrow will travel on a British Airways Concorde which will have to fly out over the Atlantic to reach supersonic speeds - its flight time will be longer than the regular shuttle. A team of 'meeters and greeters' will be at Belfast's Aldergrove airport, with a tailor from Parson &amp; Parsons, dress hire specialists, to measure up any male delegate who arrives without the required black tie evening dress for the dinner. The mood is celebration mixed with remembrance. A boy soprano from the city's St George's Choir will sing grace before dinner - a song entitled 'A Grateful Heart'. 'I don't know whether that will help the dinner go down or not,' said Mr Mawhinney. But no one is going to argue with the sentiment. The menu will feature Northern Ireland produce. The 370 guests will be able to drink Antrim Hills water with their North Down lamb, the renowned 'Comber' potatoes, Irish salmon and a 'Causeway' souffle. The wines are French - a Macon Blanc Villages and Chateau Canada - but liqueurs include St Brendan's cream liqueur and a Hennessey cognac, which some would describe as another Irish brand name. Before dinner, Black Velvet is on offer - a mixture of Moet &amp; Chandon champagne and Guinness, another household name, although a southern one. Even in deciding the decor for the conference hall, politics is never far away. 'In Northern Ireland, you have to remember colours are very important. You don't want red, white and blue and equally you don't want just green, white and orange,' said Ms Faulkner referring to the union jack and the Irish tricolour, the flags of the two traditions of the province. So what is the conference's chosen colour scheme? 'A mix of terracotta and purple.'</p>

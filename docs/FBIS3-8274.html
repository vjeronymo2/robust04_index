			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] At a session last night of the Social Democratic  Party [Socijal Demokratska Partija -- SDP] executive, a protocol  on unification of the Social-Democratic Party of Croatia and the  Social-Democratic Party of Croatia [Socijal Demokratska Stranka  Hrvatske -- SDH] was signed by SDP President Ivica Racan and SDH  president Antun Vujic, the SDP announced today.    Departing from their identical programs and commitments and  closely related political views, the SDP and the SDH maintain  that their unification is in the interest of both parties and  particularly the left-wing of social-democratic orientation, its  [SDP] statement says. Both parties regard this move as the  first and necessary step toward a broader association of  Croatia's left-wing democratic forces, it is stated in the  protocol agreed by the presidents of the two parties. It will  go in effect once it has been endorsed by the relevant bodies of  both parties.    The united party is the political and legal successor of the  SDP and SDH. Its official name is the Social-Democratic Party  of Croatia [Socijal-Demokratska Partija Hrvatske]. According to  the protocol, the post of president will be performed by Ivica  Racan. Antun Vujic will act as president of the council. This  change at the helm of the SDP council was carried out in  agreement with, and with the support of, the present president  of the council, Zdravko Tomac. The party's top bodies will  include members of the hitherto top leaderships of both parties.  A unification congress, or a convention, is expected to take  place by the end of April, the statement says.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Correspondent Zdenek Horeni report: "Seven Presidents on </F> Russia"]    [Text] Prague, 19 Apr -- Seven presidents of central  European countries have advocated cooperation with Russia, but  they also criticized Russia's desire to achieve special status  for itself within the American Partnership for Peace program.    The seven heads of state met at the end of last week in the  Czech city of Litomysl (roughly 100 km east of Prague) to  discuss in an informal setting topical questions concerning  their region, relations with Russia, and the situation in the  Balkans. The initiator of the meeting was [Czech President]  Vaclav Havel; the presidents of Austria, Hungary, Germany,  Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia also took part. During a  television discussion held at the end of the meeting the Czech  president noted that "peace in Europe and the world as a whole  is impossible without normal partnership relations between the  West and Russia." At the same Russia was warned against trying  to turn central Europe into its zone of influence.    The presidents of the Czech Republic and Germany reacted  most  sharply to the well-known Russian objections to the possible  shift of NATO's eastern borders toward the CIS borders. The  former stated that the period when the Soviet Union dictated to  the socialist countries what they were allowed to join and what  not, was over." The latter stressed that cooperation with  Russia should rule out any desire on its part to "impose its  diktat upon us."    The participants in the meeting in Litomysl stated that they  are not seeking to create any kind of pact, although...  Although they did clearly exhibit one tendency -- an  anti-Russian tendency. The presidents of the seven countries of  Central Europe did not adopt any documents at Litomysl.    The meetings of the Central European "G-7" will be  continued.  Hungary, in 1995, will be the next host.</p>

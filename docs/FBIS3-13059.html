The minister  of state for external affairs, Mr. R.L. Bhatia, said in the  Rajya Sabha today that the references to Kashmir by responsible  U.S. officials lack balance and proper perspective. Answering a  spate of supplementaries on the reported shift in the U.S.  policy, he said the government has taken due note of the fact  and is dealing with it accordingly. We are protesting where it  is necessary, he said. And Mr. Bhatia added that in diplomacy,  there are many ways to explain one's point and convey resentment  where it is called for. Mr. Bhatia said (?the government) has  told the Clinton administration that Kashmir is an integral part  of India, and we will not brook any interference in our internal  affairs. Observing that there seems to be no finality in the  U.S. position, the minister said New Delhi is having a  continuous dialogue with Washington to make it understand our  position. Mr. Bhatia pointed out that Indo-U.S. relations are  multifaceted in nature, and despite differences on certain  issues, there are numerous constructive and mutually beneficial  aspects. Human rights, nuclear nonproliferation, and Kashmir are  some of the issues on which there are differences of opinion.  Asked about the forthcoming visit of the U.S. assistant  secretary of state to New Delhi, Ms. Robin Raphel, he said  whomsoever she meets she would be told categorically that her  comments have damaged the Indo-Pak relations and encourage  Pakistani militancy. Reiterating that there is no question of  third country mediation on Kashmir, the minister said it is not  a disputed territory. He agreed to table the documents  exchanged between India and Pakistan at the recent foreign  secretary-level talks. Replying to the main question, the  minister said Islamabad's clandestine nuclear weapons program  has been confirmed time and again. Mr. Bhatia made it clear  that New Delhi neither has nor intends to acquire weapons of  mass destruction. He said the real danger, therefore, is of  nuclear adventurism on the part of Pakistan. The minister  regretted that Washington has not done much to prevent Pakistan  from acquiring and retaining weapons of mass destruction.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] The Finnish Foreign Ministry has revised its  calculations of the cost to Finland of joining the European  Union [EU]. In contrast to earlier estimates, the Foreign  Ministry now says that Finland will become a net contributor to  the EU budget in the first year as a member. The revised  calculations are 1 billion markkas [FMk] less favorable to  Finland than those put forward a month ago.    [Begin recording] [unidentified correspondent] Finland's top  EU negotiators on 29 March presented new figures on the cost of  membership in the European Union. According to the latest  calculations, Finland's dues to the EU will be FMk6.8 billion or  over 1 billion dollars. If this is accurate, then Finland  stands to become a net contributor of some FMk350 million to the  European budget in 1995. Finnish Foreign Minister Heikki  Haavisto suggests that Finland's net membership cost could rise  to FMk2 to 3 billion in the future.    The latest figures come just a month after the completion of  the accession talks. Earlier calculations portrayed Finland as  a net beneficiary of some FMk700 million next year. The  discrepancy between this and the new calculations is in the  range of FMk1 billion. The gap has been explained by the fact  that Finland, and evidently other applicant countries as well,  have counted certain EU support moneys twice in calculating the  cost of membership.

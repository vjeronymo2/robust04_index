			<p><P> December 22, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> FIRE CHIEF GLAD HE'S HELPED MANY  </P> <P> Tears welled up in Fire Chief Raymond C. Picard's eyes after he embraced an  employee leaving for a better job in another city's fire department.  </P> <P> "I'm not crying because of me," said Picard, who is retiring. "These are tears  of joy. I'm happy for her."  </P> <P> During his 23 years as Huntington Beach's fire chief, Picard said, one of his  greatest pleasures has been watching members of his staff advance in their  careers. He proudly points out that six of his former subordinates became fire  chiefs at other cities.  </P> <P> "After all, as chief of the department, what are you here for? The people. And  it's wonderful to see them make their lives better," he said.  </P> <P> Picard, who will cap four decades of fire service when he retires Monday, is  revered throughout the state as one of California's best and most creative fire  chiefs.  </P> <P> He has served on many state and national firefighting committees, and has a  gubernatorial appointment to the California State Board of Fire Services. He  has also garnered dozens of awards and accolades, including a governor's award  for his leadership in the wake of the Feb. 7 oil spill off Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> But he says that the plaques, certificates and recognition hardly measure up to  the reward of having helped others.  </P> <P> "The bottom line in this job is that the pride comes from serving people in the  community," he said. "It all comes down to 'Did you do good? Have you made  others' lives better? Are a lot of people now living, or recuperating from  entrapments or physical injuries, in part because of your efforts?' "  </P> <P> "To be able to say that hundreds of people (injured in disasters) today are  vital members of society as a result of your accomplishments is deeply  rewarding. Nothing is more tragic than to have a member of your family die or  have personal tragedies" as a result of an accident, he said.  </P> <P> Picard formed the region's training and response network, introduced Orange  County's first computer-assisted dispatching system and advanced the area's  paramedic and hazardous-material response services.  </P> <P> "He approaches firefighting as a military person would a campaign," Mayor Peter  M. Green said. "He has a good, analytical mind. Also, he's brought creativity  to the area . . . and (he) is very personable."  </P> <P> Picard plans to spend much of his retirement with his family, playing  racquetball and golf, skiing and rediscovering his passion from his younger  days -- surfing.  </P> <P> But, he admits, he likely will never abandon fire service altogether.  </P> <P> He said his major retirement project will be to develop an accreditation system  for fire service associations throughout North America, in order to "raise the  professional standards and excellence of fire agencies.  </P> <P> "I may do an isolated seminar or lecture here or there, just for fun," he  added. "And I want to continue my professional focus, by writing periodicals  and texts on things I know and I feel should be recorded and made a part of  history." JOHN PENNER  </P></p>

			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Tories dismiss Lib Dems' tax plans The Conservatives yesterday dismissed Liberal Democrat plans for a radical tax and benefits shake-up as a recipe for 'economic suicide for the UK'. Mr Jeremy Hanley, the Conservative party chairman, said the plan would damage inward investment and increase the tax burden on middle-income earners. The plan, which will be put to the Liberal Democrat annual conference next month, focuses on the abolition of employees' National Insurance contributions and big tax rises for the better off. Mr Alan Beith, the Liberal Democrat deputy leader, denied that the proposals were intended to draw a sharp contrast between the Liberal Democrats and the low-tax rhetoric of Labour's newly elected leadership. But he said the plan was intended to reverse Conservative attacks on progressive taxation and help cut unemployment by reducing the poverty trap. Mr Hanley accused the Liberal Democrats of hypocrisy. He said: 'I think they will rue this day, and they will probably try to wriggle out of it before the next election.' The impact of the plan is difficult to assess because the Liberal Democrats will not decide the precise level of tax rates, thresholds and credits until near the election. However, low-income households would benefit from the replacement of employees' NICs by a pensions payment starting at the current income tax threshold of Pounds 3,445 rather than the NIC threshold of Pounds 2,964. The low paid would also benefit from the abolition of the 20 per cent tax band and the replacement of personal allowances with a tax credit. These measures would remove more than 50,000 people from the tax net. The higher paid would suffer in several ways: The ceiling on NICs, currently Pounds 22,360, would be abolished, although the current 10 per cent rate would probably fall to nearer 8 per cent. The current 40 per cent tax band would be split in three, with a top level of no more than 60 per cent on incomes above Pounds 100,000. The middle band would probably be about 50 per cent, taking effect at a threshold of Pounds 60,000 or higher. The threshold for the lowest of the higher rates would rise by at least Pounds 5,000 from the current 40 per cent threshold of just over Pounds 27,000, giving some relief to middle earners. Inheritance tax would be replaced by an accessions tax on recipients, treating gifts as income, with safeguards for family business assets. Mortgage interest tax relief would be replaced by the extension of housing benefit to mortgage holders on low incomes. Other proposals include replacing personal equity plans and tax exempt savings accounts with tax credits on investment income.</p>

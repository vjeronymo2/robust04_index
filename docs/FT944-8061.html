			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Benn expelled from MPs' sleaze inquiry Mr Tony Benn, the veteran leftwing Labour MP, was last night voted off the Commons committee on privileges which is investigating allegations of sleaze against two Conservative MPs. The decision to remove Mr Benn was taken by the 17 MPs on the committee after the former Labour cabinet minister broke its rules and gave the press an account of the discussions at its last meeting. The decision was taken after a session lasting 1 1/2 hours, and will be debated in the Commons - possibly later this week. The Labour MP can only be formally removed after a vote by the entire House. Mr Tony Newton, the leader of the Commons and chairman of the committee, said after the meeting: 'The committee has met and agreed a report to the House recommending Mr Benn be removed from the committee forthwith. The report, together with the minutes of the proceedings relating to the committee, will be published as soon as possible.' Mr Benn later released his own report of the committee's proceedings and the background to the meeting. It is understood that only two MPs - Mr Bill Michie, the MP for Sheffield Heeley, and Mr Benn himself - voted against the expulsion. One Labour committee member said that he backed the principle of opening some committee sessions to the public but Mr Benn's policy of giving the press a full account of private sessions could not be justified. The committee is due to interview two Conservative MPs, Mr Graham Riddick and Mr David Tredinnick, in the next few weeks after allegations that they received cash for asking parliamentary questions. It is also expected to probe allegations that two former ministers, Mr Neil Hamilton and Mr Tim Smith, took payments from Mr Mohamed Fayed, the chairman of Harrods, for tabling questions. The committee has been in deadlock since last month when Labour MPs, including Mr Benn, withdrew from its proceedings over a decision to hold the inquiry in camera. Labour MPs have insisted that justice must be seen to be done in the 'cash-for-questions' affair. But Tory MPs have expressed fears that a public session - which could be reported under the protection of 'parliamentary privilege' - would be unfair to interviewees. After its last session on November 1 Mr Benn published the committee's private deliberations as 'my own reports of its proceedings'. His account of the meeting showed that the Conservative members argued strongly against interviewing Mr Riddick and Mr Tredinnick as long as Mr Benn insisted on publication. A motion expelling the MP could be put to the Commons later this week. The committee will decide under what conditions it will interview the two Tory MPs after the expulsion has been debated.</p>

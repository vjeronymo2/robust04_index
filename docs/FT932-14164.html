			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Lower sugar crop forecast INDIA WILL produce 11m tonnes of white sugar in 1992-93 (October-September), down from a record 13.3m tonnes last year, food minister Mr Kalpnath Rai said yesterday, reports Reuter from New Delhi. Production has dwindled because of a drought in the western state of Maharashtra and some other parts of the country, the Press Trust of India quoted him as saying. He said at least 500,000 tonnes of sugar would be exported during the present year, about the same as last year. Mr Rai said that carry-over stocks stood at about 1.6m tonnes. The country exported 321,000 tonnes of white sugar in the first ten months of the 1992-93 fiscal year (April-March), Mr Kamaluddin Ahmed, the minister of state for commerce said in Parliament.</p>

			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> STATE SUED ON FOSTER CHILD PAYMENT RULES  </P> <P> A lawsuit seeking to overturn a state policy that denies foster care payments  to children placed in homes with relatives was filed in federal court by the  city-county of San Francisco and the National Center for Youth Law. Deukmejian  Administration officials estimate foster care support would cost an additional  $50 million for 11,000 children who fall within this category.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Senate Health Committee approved and sent to the Appropriations  Committee a bill by Assemblyman Rusty Areias (D-Los Banos) to accomplish the  same goal. Gov. George Deukmejian has vetoed such legislation in the past, but  the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals last fall ruled in an Oregon case that  denying foster care funding to children who live with close relatives was  unconstitutional. "If we don't do it in the Legislature, the courts are going  to make us do it," said Sen. Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles), who chairs the  Health Committee.  </P></p>

			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Letter: Private sector cannot support state pensions if tax incentives cut Sir, Readers of Barry Riley's Long View (July 10/11) could be forgiven for concluding that the expressions of concern from within the pensions movement following the spring Budget simply represent the special pleading of a handful of rich members of large pension schemes. This is not so. Our concern is this. The government is sending very clear signals that the whole working population should look far more to arranging its long-term retirement savings through occupational or personal provision, rather than through the state. Yet the spring Budget dealt a hefty blow to confidence that there will be a tax regime which encourages long-term saving, as opposed to short or medium-term consumption. The government announced on March 16, without any consultation, that with effect from April 6 it would be divesting Pounds 600m from individuals' savings for retirement into its own coffers (that is in effect what the Budget reduction in pension funds' tax credits did). This cannot be perceived as encouraging employers to sponsor occupational pension schemes or individuals to make personal provision. All the less so when the tax credit is uncoupled from the rate of Advance Corporation Tax, raising fears of a special tax on pension funds' investment income, involving further transfers from individuals' savings to the Treasury. The freezing of the earnings cap adds to the long-term problems which the cap will in any case bring. The cap only affects highly paid individuals but, because it is linked to prices which rise more slowly than earnings upon which many individuals' pensions are based, it will, over time, bite ever lower down the earnings scale. This means that the longer one has to save to retirement the more likely it is that one will find oneself penalised by the cap, with the added possibility now that the government will accelerate the process by freezing the cap. Again, hardly an incentive to long-term retirement saving. In our contacts with the Treasury we have emphasised that, if private retirement saving is to shoulder some of the burden now carried by the state, the current relatively modest tax incentives for such long-term savings need to be maintained. Equally important, to foster the confidence needed to save for tomorrow what one could consume today, the government needs to give a clear statement that the incentives will be maintained.

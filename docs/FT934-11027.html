			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / German output marked down WEST GERMAN industrial output fell by a provisional 2 per cent in September, according to price and seasonally-adjusted figures published by the economics ministry yesterday. The ministry, which said it expected the final figure to be adjusted upwards by a 'good two points' later, noted that the result had been decisively affected by a 2.5 per cent drop in manufacturing production. Total industrial output, which includes mining, construction and energy, stood 7.6 per cent lower than a year earlier, although the ministry's statement suggested the final outcome would be a year-on-year decline of around 5.5 per cent. This would be unchanged from August, when production increased by a revised 2.2 per cent. The statistics support other indications that the worst of the recession is past, although heavy industry in particular is still struggling and consumer goods production was also markedly lower than it was a month earlier. According to yesterday's figures, combined output in August and September was 0.5 per cent higher than in the previous two months and 6.2 per cent lower than in the same period a year earlier. According to this two-month measure, construction - up 2.4 per cent - was the only sector showing any year-on-year improvement. Production of investment goods was 11 per cent lower. According to the Federation of German Industry (BDI), industrial output will decline further, although only marginally, in the coming months. Prospects for a reversal of the trend seem dim, it says in its latest monthly report. Consumer demand will expand very slowly. Public demand will remain weak because of spending cuts, and there is little reason to expect a boost to capital spending because of heavy investment in the recent past, the BDI adds.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Xin Wen (6580 2429): "Minister of Public </F> Security Tao Siju Urges Public Security Organs at All Levels To  Fight Corruption in Light of the Specific Conditions"]    [Text] At the national meeting of the discipline  inspection commission secretaries of public security departments  (bureaus), Tao Siju, minister of public security, stressed that  the in-depth struggle against corruption in the public security  organs has a bearing on the overall situation of guaranteeing  reform, development, and stability throughout the country, so  public security organs at all levels must better understand the  significance of the struggle, must truly grasp the key points,  take effective action, and strive for new results in carrying  out the anticorruption struggle in depth.    Tao Siju said: After the second plenum of the CPC Central  Discipline Inspection Commission last August, the Ministry of  Public Security and the public security organs in all provinces,  autonomous regions, and municipalities carried out the  anticorruption struggle. Leading cadres at and above the section  level and directors and political commissars of the county and  city (district) public security bureaus first examined and  rectified their own behavior and further enhanced their  consciousness in preventing and resisting corruption and  exercising self-discipline. Discipline was strictly enforced,  and a number of lawbreaking and discipline-violating cases were  seriously handled. The misconduct of some local public security  organs in coastal areas -- such as getting involved in smuggling  and shielding smuggling activities -- was effectively checked.  Irregular charges and fees were basically stopped. Initial  results were achieved in dealing with the problem of running  profit-making enterprises and doing business. Such malpractices  as partially enforcing the law, bending the law for the benefit  of relatives or friends, and replacing prison terms with fines  was brought under control.    Tao Siju pointed out: In the anticorruption struggle, the  public security organs should grasp the key points in light of  their own characteristics and should concentrate their efforts  on eliminating such malpractices as bending the law for the  benefit of relatives or friends or for selfish gain, extorting  confessions by torture, and seeking illegal gains by abusing  powers for issuing certificates, licenses, and right of abode in  cities. The anticorruption struggle should focus on eliminating  such misconduct, and stern action should be taken. A number of  serious lawbreaking and discipline-violating cases involving  leading organs, leading cadres, and police officers should be  thorough investigated and properly handled.    Tao Siju stressed: The public security organs must exercise  more effective leadership over the anticorruption struggle, must  explicitly fix the responsibilities for leading cadres and  leading organs so that they will actually exercise effective  supervision over their immediate subordinates from the Ministry  of Public Security on down. Leading cadres in the public  security organs should have a stronger sense of management and  should strictly manage the police rank and file. If any problem  occurs in a public security organ, disciplinary action should  not only be taken against those involved, but also against those  in charge. Public security organs at all levels must continue  to conduct education on the principle of serving the people  wholeheartedly, on the mass line, and on the legal system for  all personnel. At the same time, the relevant rules and  regulations should be improved, and supervisory mechanisms  should be perfected.    Tao Siju finally required that the discipline inspection and  supervisory departments and various functional departments of  the public security organs perform their functions more  effectively, coordinate their work in exercising comprehensive  control, and jointly advance the anticorruption struggle in the  public security organs.</p>

			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPECIAL SCREENINGS: A TASTE OF THE BIZARRE FROM MEXICO;  </P> <P> MOVIES: UCLA FILM ARCHIVE SCHEDULES A SERIES OF WORKS BY ARTURO RIPSTEIN AND  JAIME HUMBERTO HERMOSILLO.  </P> <P> The UCLA Film Archive, the primary film programmer for the Los Angeles  Festival, launches Saturday in Melnitz Theater "The Films of Arturo Ripstein  and Jaime Humberto Hermosillo." Not only is the archive repeating films shown  in the L.A. Festival, but adding many more by two of Mexico's finest directors.  The influence of Luis Bunuel, long in Mexican exile, is probably inescapable  for serious Mexican directors, yet Ripstein and Hermosillo have developed their  own distinctive personalities while sharing with the Spanish master a taste for  the bizarre and darkly humorous.  </P> <P> Ironically, Ripstein first came to attention with "The Castle of Purity"  (1972), which screens Saturday at 7:30 p.m., a film so off-putting that his  subsequent achievements have come as a surprise. An allegory of relentless  morbidity and tedium from a story by Octavio Paz, it stars Claudio Brook as a  rat-poison manufacturer so disenchanted with the world that he attempts to seal  it off entirely from his family, who when we meet them have been sequestered in  their crumbling mansion for 18 years.  </P> <P> By 1978, however, Ripstein came up with a vastly more impressive and  imaginative fable, "A Place Without Limits" (screening Sunday at 7:30 p.m.).  Spanning two generations of life in a seedy village falling increasingly into  the grasp of an elderly politico, it tells of a drag-queen flamenco dancer  (Roberto Cobo, who is remarkable with his sinewy physique at poignant odds with  his effeminate mannerisms) seduced by the local madam (Ana Martin) on a bet in  order that she win ownership of her bordello -- and of Cobo's later brave act  of self-sacrifice to protect their beautiful daughter (Lucha Villa).  </P> <P> The film emerges as an all-out attack on machismo, suggesting that it can often  mask in a man a highly insecure sense of masculinity. "A Place Without Limits"  is "La Cage aux Folles" played for tragedy; it has been reported that Manuel  Puig contributed to the script without credit.  </P> <P> Best known for "Dona Herlinda and Her Son," which has been called the first  Mexican film to deal openly with homosexuality, Hermosillo is captivated by  dominance and submission within relationships of people of bourgeois propriety.  Subtle, languorous and sly, Hermosillo's 1974 "The Dog's Birthday," screening  Sunday after a 2 p.m. presentation of Ripstein's "Time to Die," gradually  reveals the full and unexpected impact upon a prosperous middle-aged tailor  (Jorge Martinez de Hoyos) of the murder of a beautiful young woman (Diana  Bracho) whose husband (Hector Bonilla), a handsome champion swimmer, was once  in the tailor's employ. Hermosillo holds his cards until the last moment and  then delivers a grand slam.  </P> <P> If you missed "Passion According to Bereneice" (1975), one of Hermosillo's best  films, you will have another chance to see it when it screens Saturday  following "The Castle of Purity." Hermosillo gracefully sets up a volatile  attraction between a repressed young widow (Martha Navarro), her beauty  scarcely marred by an intriguing scar, and a dashing young doctor (Pedro  Armendariz Jr.).

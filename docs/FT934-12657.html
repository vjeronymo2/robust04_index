			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Concession offered on BR pensions MR JOHN MacGregor, transport secretary, yesterday tried to win over Tory MPs sceptical about rail privatisation by offering a concession over BR's pension fund. In a letter to Tory backbenchers, Mr MacGregor said the government would seek agreement with British Rail's pension-fund trustees before putting proposals before parliament. The move follows the government's defeat in the Lords over its plans to water down its obligations on Treasury contributions to the fund. The Lords passed an amendment tabled by Lord Peyton, a former Conservative transport minister, which would re-impose an obligation on the government to secure the trustees' written agreement before altering its financial commitments. Lord Caithness, transport minister, had argued the amendment would in effect give the pension-fund managers a veto over government expenditure. He said the obligation should be to consult the trustees. In his letter, Mr MacGregor says: 'The government's obligations will be reflected as an asset of pension funds and taken into account in determining any surplus for pensions. We intend to agree the details of such an arrangement with the trustees and we will bring before parliament in due course orders which will give effect to such agreement.' Mr Andrew Bowden, MP for Brighton Kemptown and one of the backbenchers who forced the government to climb down over pensioners' railcards, said he would support the sell-off bill, but with reservations. He said: 'I am delighted that the government is bringing appropriate orders before parliament to protect the pension fund.' Mr Tim Rathbone, MP for Lewes and another backbench sceptic, also welcomed Mr MacGregor's assurances. Ministers, however, made clear last night that their concession did not mean they would accept the amendment in full. This is why some MPs remained sceptical about how far the government was prepared to go in accepting Lord Peyton's amendment. Rebel Tory MPs are also threatening to back an earlier Lords' amendment allowing BR to bid for the franchises under which the network will be gradually privatised. Mr Rathbone said the government had nothing to fear since ministers had been successful in attracting proposals for management buy-outs when it was not known whether BR could bid for the franchises.

Gretzky the Greatest One!  </P> <P> Enough already! This isn't even a hockey town.  </P> <P> I don't recall Kareem Abdul-Jabbar receiving this kind of coverage when he  became the all-time scoring leader in the NBA. I can appreciate what Wayne  Gretzky has done for the sport, but, Gretzky Watch, give me a break.  </P> <P> JUANITA JORDAN, Los Angeles  </P></p>

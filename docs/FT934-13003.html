			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading WHILE lacking the fervour of the previous day's trading, equities derivatives showed strength in the afternoon, still clinging to hopes of a half point cut in UK interest rates, writes Christine Buckley. Although it started the day a little tentatively, the December contract on the FT-SE 100 was enlivened by good GDP figures. The French cutting of interest rates further bolstered hopes for UK interest rates and more buoyancy for the contract came from good performances in gilts and short sterling. A strong Wall Street provided an afternoon push and the contract traded at a healthy premium to the cash market for most of the day. December began at 3,217, hitting its high of the day of 3,232 just before its close of 3,228 - a lead of just over 15 points on its fair value premium to cash of about 15 points. Volume was subdued at 6,167 contracts. Index options were again a strong feature in traded options with the FT-SE 100 option accounting for 10,999 lots of the total options volume of 31,446 lots.</p>

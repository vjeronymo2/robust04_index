			<p>941201 FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (23): The most important deal of your life - Richard Gourlay looks into the future as Wigits is sold to its management The process of raising money for a management buy-out involves managers in the most important deal of their lives. Few will have relevant previous experience. Here is a version of how a deal might evolve and be structured and how it might turn out for the venture capitalists and the MBO team David Mann knew something was up when he saw his boss's car in the company parking lot. As managing director of Wigits, the engineering subsidiary of Publico Ltd, he would have expected notice of a visit from head office. He soon unravelled the mystery. 'Good news and bad news, David,' said Andrew Suit, group planning supremo, tetchily. 'The board's been persuaded by some damned institution that Wigits doesn't fit in our corporate strategy. I don't agree, but there you are. You have three weeks to mount a management buy-out or the board will offer the company in an auction. Keep in touch.' Mann's jaw fell as Suit swept past him to the car park. Wigits's five-strong executive team had often dreamed about an MBO. But now it was thrust upon them Mann knew they had no idea where to begin. As he hurried along the corridor to his finance director, he wondered why the normally amiable Suit had been so abrupt. Could it be because he would be left out of the deal? Or was it because the sale of Wigits would shrink Suit's empire? His reverie was ended when he nearly collided with Alan Counter, the finance director. 'Alan, great news - we've been given the opportunity to mount an MBO - call the accountants,' Mann said. A week later, after a series of preliminary meetings, Mann and his team were sitting in the offices of Grapple Ventures, an investor in MBO and MBI teams which had kept particularly close to Wigits's local accountant. The tension was palpable. While Mann needed Alan Counter in preparatory meetings because of his knowledge of the figures, Grapple had just brought him bad news. While he was a fine subsidiary finance director when it came to dealing with a head office, his skills would not be relevant or appropriate when Wigits had its own shareholders and was heading for a flotation. Grapple had concluded it would need to bring in a new finance director. Mann and his team had already burned the midnight oil to reassess their profit projections. There was nothing like potential ownership of the business to encourage close examination of every budget line - what Mann referred to as 'rooting out contracts to service the office rubber plants'. Before the buy-out was mooted, Wigits's performance had been steady but unspectacular. Pre-tax profits were Pounds 6m in 1993 from sales of about Pounds 80m from the main specialist metal business and Wigits's smaller components manufacturing operation. The two businesses had net assets of Pounds 52m. The trick was to come up with an offer for Wigits both acceptable to Publico and attractive to Grapple Ventures or another MBO backer. An added complication was that the management of the components business had got wind of the deal from Publico and said they would be highly disillusioned if they could not mount their own buy-out. Grapple cautioned that the first priority must be to focus on a deal with Publico. The starting point, the financiers said, was to ascertain how much debt the business could support on reasonable profit projections. Grapple believed the Pounds 6m profit could become Pounds 7.5m in 1995, Pounds 9m the next year and Pounds 11m by 1997. Despite the relatively steady cash flow from operations, Grapple wanted interest to be covered at least twice by pre-tax profits. With an all-in interest cost of 10 per cent, Pounds 6m of profits could support an interest bill of Pounds 3m - or Pounds 30m of debt. Next, Grapple took a sighting shot at how Publico might value the engineering business using a reasonable market multiple. Looking at prospective profits of Pounds 7.5m (post-tax profits of about Pounds 5m) and a p/e multiple of about 12, Grapple reckoned Pounds 60m would be a reasonable price. The question was whether investing Pounds 30m of equity (Pounds 60m less Pounds 30m of debt) would give Grapple an adequate return. The answer was no. At that price, the financier's annualised rate of return, assuming a flotation in three years time at the same p/e multiple would be in the low 20 per cent area. Back to the drawing board. Mann, with the bit between his teeth, suggested Grapple had been too pessimistic about the speed at which re-focused management could accelerate profit growth. Grapple was adamant. Wigits might think it knew its market but the financiers had seen more missed projections than Mann had had hot dinners. Wigits tried another tack. 'What about putting in more debt,' said Mann who fancied himself as something of an instant expert on MBO financing. 'I'm told that all those banks that stopped lending to MBOs in the early 1990s are shovelling out money in bagfuls, claiming they never left the market. Let's leverage up a bit. Our cash flow is solid enough and it'll raise your IRRs (internal rate of return).' Grapple had thought of this. The recent appetite for banks to put on assets was already worrying, bringing back memories of the highly-geared deals such as Magnet and Isosceles in the late 1980s. The senior partner would not budge. If more debt was loaded in, the assessment of an acceptable return would also have to rise to compensate for the increased risk. Looking at a lower Pounds 57m price for Wigits, Grapple was happy with the numbers. Mann was worried this would not wash with Publico. But as time was ticking by his mind turned, not for the first time, to what the management team would get and how much they would have to invest. By now familiar with the alchemy of MBO gearing, he knew the answers were respectively lots and not very much. At a purchase price of Pounds 57m, Grapple would be putting in Pounds 27m of equity. But Pounds 26m of that would be in the form of preference shares or subordinated loan stock which would be repaid first. Grapple would be putting only Pounds 1m of pure equity into the transaction. On the principle that management should put up a 'meaningful' amount but that most managers were salary slaves unable to lay their hands on too much capital, the team would be putting up a total of Pounds 250,000. That would give them 20 per cent of the equity. Mann also wanted to build in ratchets to increase this stake if results exceeded expectations. But that could wait. The issue of what to do with the components subsidiary had arisen again. First, its management might be seriously demotivated if they were forced to stay within the group and outside the Wigits MBO team. In addition, merchant bankers suggested Wigits could be more easily floated as a company if it were focused exclusively on specialist metals. Selling the components business immediately would lead to a smaller capital gain for Grapple. But by focusing Wigits, it could float at a significantly higher multiple. It all seemed so easy to Mann. Sitting in another interminable meeting with lawyers, his mind wandered to a sunlit day three years hence when the company was being floated on the stock exchange. Champagne corks were popping and Grapple's senior partner was standing with his arm around Mann's shoulder. The business had indeed made Pounds 11m before tax, or Pounds 7.5m after tax, and had been floated in its entirety on a multiple of about 12 times. This gave a market capitalisation of Pounds 90m. Senior debt, by then down to Pounds 23m after repayments, had been repaid, leaving Pounds 67m. Grapple had then received its Pounds 26m of preference shares, which left Pounds 41m to be divided between ordinary shareholders. Grapple had pocketed Pounds 33m for its equity, which with the repaid prefs gave it a total return of Pounds 59m - or an IRR over the period of 32 per cent. And the management team had received Pounds 8m for its Pounds 250,000 stake. Suddenly, this Elysian dream evaporated and was replaced by another altogether darker vision dominated by the smirking figure of Andrew Suit, head office planning supremo. Something had gone wrong. Wigits's sales must have collapsed - maybe the French contract had fallen through or the Americans were finally perfecting a ceramic substitute for metals. Sales were static. There was no flotation and no champagne. Supportive but subdued, a junior Grapple executive was trying to retrieve something by re-negotiating a preference dividend. The wind whistling around Wigits's windows seemed to whisper 'You are in limbo - the land of the living dead.'

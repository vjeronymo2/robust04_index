			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Dissent at Lonrho's AGM Mr Tiny Rowland and Mr Dieter Bock made great show of their 'renewed friendship' at Lonrho's annual meeting yesterday, but smaller shareholders expressed anger at the cost of the joint chief executives' battle for control. The focus of resentment was a Pounds 2.4m payment to four supporters of Mr Rowland, as compensation for their retirement from the board. It is a move which shifts the balance of power in favour of Mr Bock. The fairly cordial tone of yesterday's meeting took a sharp turn when this compensation was put to the vote. A barrage of criticism was followed by only marginal approval, of 134 votes to 117, in the first round. The subsequent three rounds of voting seemed to sway further against the proposals, to the visible discomfort of the four directors. The chairman demanded a poll, which included the proxy votes of institutions, and achieved overwhelming support. The company had already held 260m proxies in favour and only 25m against. Bitter shareholders questioned the purpose of having a vote, but they did succeed in tarnishing what was meant to be a celebration of 'a year of rationalisation and major progress'. Mr Rene Leclezio, the outgoing chairman, also dented the image of unity put forward by the joint chief executives. In the chairman's speech, prior to the vote, Mr Leclezio called upon colleagues 'not to destroy the unique character of Lonrho by trying to turn it into a faceless company'. This refers to Mr Bock's attempts to introduce a more conventional corporate and management structure in an attempt to regain the support of the City. Mr Rowland seemed to get the popular vote yesterday - one shareholder suggested that political donations should be used to earn him a 'well-deserved' place on the honours list - but Mr Bock can feel satisfied with events. Despite vocal opposition and large expense, four supporters of Mr Rowland will be removed from the board. This enables Mr Bock to consolidate his position of power in a company that 12 months earlier was considered a one-man concern.</p>

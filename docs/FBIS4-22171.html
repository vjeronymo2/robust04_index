			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA military columnist Sergey </F> Doronin: "The Commander-in-Chief's Word of Honor"]    [Text] I caught sight of the blip from the NATO Orion  ASW aircraft on the air situation plot in the Kola Air Defense  Zone command post at 0849 on 31 March. Keeping a distance of 50  km from our shore, it was completing a turn onto the reverse  course, from Cape Svyatoy Nos to North Cape, so as to return in  30-40 minutes. The friends in the partnership for peace were  working in the previous manner...    Navymen dislike Orions. Crews of surface ships dislike them  because they are impudent. Not only will they fly around the  ship, but they also will not fail to roar over superstructures.  Crews of strategic submarines departing on patrol duty dislike  them because the sonobuoys scattered by an Orion will transmit  the submarine's characteristic noises to the aircraft with  almost one-hundred percent certainty. The noises later will be  loaded into the computer programs of controllable mine ordnance.  In a threat period, such weapons are laid covertly off exits  from bases. You can be sure they will operate only against you.    Several years ago such actions evoked a response. Air  defense  aviation alert forces would be sent up with one mission: Hamper  reconnaissance by all possible methods but one -- destruction.    One such alert mission almost ended in tragedy. An SU-27  which had hovered over an Orion fell into the propellers, but  evidently it pleased God not to allow a great misfortune that  day. Both our fighter and the foreign reconnaissance aircraft  made it to their airfields. Well, I don't know about the  Americans, but our ace later got it pretty good. He was saved  from the anger of higher-ups only by one thing: What was then  still a Soviet nuclear powered submarine slipped unnoticed into  the Barents Sea in this commotion.    Today "force majeure" circumstances are evaluated somewhat  differently -- from the standpoint of the ability of combat  teams to adequately analyze the behavior of the tracked target  and forecast its ultimate goals.    Previous methods of "bolt-rattling" -- stopping a flight or  forcing a landing -- have been rescinded. This probably is  correct. The world has become largely different.    As a rule, yesterday's potential enemy is not behaving as  energetically, although he is not letting up in reconnaissance  activeness. Last year 179 Orion flights were registered in the  Barents Sea, and there already have been 52 in three months of  this year.    "So you see for yourself," said Lieutenant General Aleksey  Marenkov, air defense corps commander, commenting on this fact,  "that while politicians seem to be getting friendly, the  military do not forget their purpose."    By the way, it is not just aircraft of contiguous states of  Finland and Norway that operate actively near Russian borders.  It turns out the Americans also have interests in the Russian  North and are invariable participants of the various "air  shows." Not a year goes by that the British and French do not  drop in to train in detecting our subs from the air.    Pilots of private light-engine aircraft and helicopters also  are no less trouble. The specialists with whom I had occasion to  chat are far from categorizing all of them as followers of the  not unknown Mathias Rust, but there are so many who deliberately  get on the nerves of duty air defense weapon teams. Sometimes  fighter-interceptors must be scrambled and additional airspace  surveillance and tracking systems must be started up. All this  means expenditures, and no small ones: Just one liter of  aviation kerosene costs R280 today. And filling an aircraft  takes much more than ten tonnes.    Meanwhile, fighter regiments have difficulty keeping fuel  reserves at the 30-50 percent level. This is an average for the  troops. In the first quarter the Kilpyavr air regiment near  Murmansk was allocated only five percent of what was required.    The reason is not new -- Ministry of Defense inability to  pay. Aviation kerosene, solar oil and gasoline are obtained by  hook or by crook. Colonel General of Aviation Viktor Prudnikov,  commander-in-chief of the Russian Federation Air Defense Troops,  recently got all this in Omsk on his word of honor. They  believed him (regretting it for the umpteenth time!) and gave  him 26,000 tonnes on credit. Counting what came before, it will  be necessary to pay R11 billion for everything.    It is the very same picture with spare parts, but old ties  far from always help out. More and more often, suppliants are  treated indifferently: When there is prepayment, we'll talk...    I will not begin to accuse the heads of such enterprises of  a  lack of patriotism, because I know how difficult it is for them  as well -- no money to develop production, nothing to pay  workers. I ask only one thing: Do not nag those officers who  turn to you for help. They themselves already have been serving  on credit for a long time. Pay has been issued only for January  in two air regiments which I had occasion to visit -- near St.  Petersburg and Murmansk. Air defense missilemen guarding Kola  Peninsula installations -- enterprises, the atomic electric  power station at Polyarnyye Zori, Fleet garrisons and bases --  are in a similar situation. The state's debt for the Severomorsk  formation's pay is around R600 million, and it is three billion  for the large strategic formation at Arkhangelsk...    What is service without pay? Chancing to be in Murmansk  recently, a missile regiment commander was unable to buy a stick  of boiled sausage, which his wife had asked for the day before  as she handed him the last R5,000 note that had been hidden away.    "You understand, I was ashamed to ask the saleswoman to cut  off a piece, but for no more than 5,000..."    "I understand you, Lieutenant Colonel. The situation is  morally repulsive. But who would explain something else to me:  How, with whose concession, and for how much are streams with  abundant fish leased on the sly in Murmansk Oblast? Who are  they, these stern businessmen (would that they were only ours!)?  Armed with Winchesters and assault rifles, they permit  themselves to threaten the corps commander: "We don't give a  damn, General, that you have equipment here on Rybachiy, that it  has to be removed from here by ship. Clear out of here with a  whole skin; this section of the peninsula is private property..."    Just quite recently service in the Arctic was considered  prestigious. One year for one and one-half, one and one-half  times the pay, arctic increments -- all this more than  compensated for all sorts of inconveniences of life. Today for  the most part it is zealots who inhabit the "norths," those for  whom money will not cloud the eyes. Because no one pays either  pilots or their families for clearing a snow-blocked runway.  That is how they serve, together with the airfield soldiers and  with the regimental commander.    You won't go from here to the "continent" for a replacement  very often. There are fewer and fewer who wish to move to the  Arctic, inasmuch as, having settled down in a more or less  civilized place, people do not wish to leave it for fully  understandable reasons. And you can't send them off under armed  escort.    And what is to be done with residents of former garrisons  such as of that same Novaya Zemlya? They removed the formation,  but some of the people just remained there; there is nowhere to  move to. Who will take the housing inventory on his balance  sheet? How can acceptable everyday conditions be created for  them and how can they be provided with work? Ministry of Defense  personnel suffice only for a little bit -- to maintain the vital  activity of a combat infrastructure mothballed for the time  being. The idea was for the rest to have gone over to  institutions of local government, but a government decision is  needed for this.    And the people work. Each day the combat teams of SAM launch  systems, radars and command posts and the pilots of air  squadrons go on guard over Russia's air borders. To hell with  the area's biorhythms and geographic and climatic features.  Whether it be the South or Kamchatka, there is work, with a  meaning that is simple and understandable -- protect the  Motherland. If not we, then just who will do it?</p>

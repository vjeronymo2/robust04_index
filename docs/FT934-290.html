			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / World Commodities Prices: Spices Last week we reported already that pepper prices had started to improve. During this week the upward trend continued both for white and black pepper. A recent survey in the far east reveals that white pepper stocks in Indonesia are much too low to cover the requirements for the next 7/8 months to come before the new crop will be available. It is therefore not so surprising that prices recovered from Dollars 2400 cif, a fortnight ago to about Dollars 3000 cif, today. A slight recovery in the demand(shortcovering) triggered the market already. Since not much material from other sources may be expected the supply position will remain very tight. Black pepper prices also recovered quickly from their lows (Dollars 1250 cif) to about Dollars 1600 cif,(today) all origins tended much firmer from the moment some demand came in from non traditional consuming markets.</p>

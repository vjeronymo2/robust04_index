			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Parties struggle to raise issues Conservative and Labour politicians yesterday accused each other of running poor campaigns for the local council elections, as both parties found difficulty raising new issues for a poll little more than a week away. Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, claimed that the Conservative campaign was 'in open disarray', suggesting that the government had 'failed to find a single issue that resonates with voters' concerns'. He argued that Sir Norman Fowler, Conservative party chairman, had shown signs of giving up the election battle at the weekend by suggesting that he was planning to stand down as chairman. Mr Straw said: 'It is one thing to massage expectations downwards. It is another to wave the white flag before battle has been joined.' Sir Norman immediately rejected the criticism, suggesting that Mr Straw had himself run a very bad campaign for Labour. 'If anyone wishes to stick up the white flag it should be Jack Straw, who has lost every argument,' he said. The Conservatives focused their fire on poor administration by Labour-controlled local authorities, claiming that they wasted public funds by being 'incompetent and inefficient'. Mr David Curry, the minister for local government, said that six of the 10 councils with the worst tax-collection rates in England were Labour-controlled. He also said that nine out of the 10 London borough councils with the highest employment rates were run by Labour. 'Labour councils should take a lesson from whelk-stall owners,' he said.</p>

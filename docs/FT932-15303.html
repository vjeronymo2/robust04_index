			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / UK Company News: Private client brokers merge in Pounds 7m deal BREWIN Dolphin Holdings, the London-based private client stockbroker, has acquired Bell Lawrie White from the TSB Group in a deal believed to be worth Pounds 7m. The acquisition creates one of Britain's largest private client stockbrokers, and follows a growing trend among those organisations to revert to the historic partnership structures which were held until they were purchased at hefty premiums by international banks in the run up to Big Bang in 1986. 'Firms such as ours with emphasis on private client business don't have much in common with large integrated firms,' said Mr John Hall, managing director of Brewin Dolphin. 'Many of us became unstuck because we fell between two stools in the new structures and didn't know what it was we were supposed to do.' Brewin Dolphin was the object of a management buy-out from SE Banken last year, which had bought the partnership for itself in 1986. The consideration includes the cost of repayment of BLW's debts. The enlarged firm will approximately double Brewin Dolphin's client base to about 32,000 and its assets under management will increase to some Pounds 4bn. BLW's management will become partners owning 25 per cent of the equity; two other investors, the venture capital firms of Baronsmead and 3i, will have 15 per cent and the remainder will be held by Brewin Dolphin's management. Of the funds under management, about Pounds 600m will be managed on a discretionary basis. Brewin Dolphin will retain the research capacity of BLW and will concentrate on smaller companies and Scottish companies.</p>

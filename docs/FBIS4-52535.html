			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul yesterday asked Beijing to allow the import  of South Korean cars and participation of its construction firms  in major construction projects in China, the Foreign Ministry  said.    South Korea also requested that China heighten transparency  of its trade system by lowering tariffs and relaxing  requirements for permission to import goods, it said.    While promising to positively study the Korean suggestions,  Beijing, on its part, urged Seoul to remove tariffs on 20  Chinese goods including mushrooms and asked it to be more  prudent in levying anti-dumping charges against Chinese  products,the ministry said.    The two sides made the requests during the first-day of  their  two-day working-level trade talks.    The ministry said the two sides expressed satisfaction over  the growing trade volume between the two countries and agreed to  exert efforts to remove nontariff barriers in order to further  expand bilateral trade.    According to ministry statistics, two-way trade between both  countries amounted to $9.08 billion last year, with Korea  recording $1.2 billion of trade surplus.    The two countries, in the meeting, projected their two-way  trade would reach $28 billion in 1997 and $50 billion in 2000.    The Korean side also explained to the Chinese the damage  that  Korean farmers are suffering from growing agricultural imports  from China and sought the understanding of the Chinese over this  problem, the ministry said.    The two sides will each explain their foreign trade policies  and discuss cooperation in regional and international trade  organizations including the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation  (APEC) forum and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  (GATT) at today's session, the ministry said.    Chong Ui-yong, director-general for international trade of  the ministry, is heading the Korean delegation, while Shi Wei  San, chief of the Asia bureau at the Ministry of Foreign Trade  and Economic Cooperation, is leading the Chinese side.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] General Jaime Salinas Sedo--whom Amnesty  International has described as a prisoner of conscience--will  celebrate his 58th birthday on 23 February at the Real Felipe  prison where he is serving an eight year sentence for attempting  to restore the broken democratic institutional order in the  country, an effort considered "a crime" in present day Peru.  [passage omitted]    Outside the Real Felipe prison, however, his assistants and  friends are organizing another celebration: The birth of the 13  November Movement (M-13), a nonpolitical organization created  with the objective of obtaining amnesty for military officers  imprisoned at Real Felipe and the vindication of the name of  those who suffered ill-treatment or persecution following the 13  November 1992 constitutional rebellion.    The M-13 will be officially launched on 18 February (the  first anniversary of Sedo's sentencing) during a news conference  "somewhere in Lima." The place will be announced only hours  before to prevent interference from SIN [National Intelligence  Service] agents. The founding documents will be signed on 20  February during a spartan ceremony that is expected to take  place at the Real Felipe prison yard before the arrested  military officers.    The M-13 is inspired by a UN resolution that condemns the  imprisonment of the constitutionalist officers, and by a growing  national and international support for the rebels release. It  promises a hard legal battle that will create headaches for the  military leadership that rules the country from behind the  presidential chair.    Surveys show that Salinas Sedo has the important support of  6  percent of the voters. He has become a serious presidential  alternative, creating a new front to compete against Javier  Perez de Cuellar and Ricardo Belmont's possible candidacies.    For this reason the sponsors of M-13 stress: "The movement  seeks amnesty for the arrested military officers and a ban on  partisan politics in the barracks. The movement seeks to  contribute to Peru's democratic stabilization through the  support of all the institutions and individuals who want to live  in a country where the Constitution prevails over authoritarian  adventures."    In an interview on the Radio Miraflores "Double Meaning"  program, Javier Valle Riestra defined Salinas Sedo's possible  presidential candidacy in these terms: "Some people go to jail  from powerful positions, others rise to power from jail.  General Salinas is a Peruvian citizen imprisoned for defending  the Constitution. He is willing to fight for democracy. He has  a military background and a seducing Peruvian character. This  is why he must be pardoned. His sentence does not disqualify  him from participating in elections." [passage omitted]    Salinas Sedo showed more concern for the possible  consequences of the arrest of drug trafficker Demetrio Chavez  Panaherrera, alias "Vaticano." I do not know if "Vaticano's  report is correct, but if it is, it will have very serious  repercussions and the effects will be worse than the revolt  created by La Cantuta because the corruption caused by  traffickers can destroy the Peruvian Army." [passage omitted]    Concerning the National Police "reorganization" following  the  guidelines established by the SIN, Salinas Sedo recognized that  many organizations need reorganizing. He said: "I do not  understand why the government is seeking to minimize the  activities of Dincote which, paradoxically, has given the  government its best results. The only reason is the egoist and  jealous attitude of the SIN."</p>

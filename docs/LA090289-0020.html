			<p><P> September 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROSE SIMPLY BETTING HE'LL BE REINSTATED; PUBLIC DESERVES MORE  </P> <P> How refreshing it was to see that Ross Newhan stepped up and emphasized  "character and integrity" in connection with Hall of Fame consideration for  Pete Rose.  </P> <P> Never mind that there have been others who have reached the Hall of Fame  although their character and integrity have been suspect. It is time that  character and integrity are reintroduced to the sport.  </P> <P> And what ever happened to holding people responsible for their actions instead  of excusing them as a sickness? Pete Rose had choices -- he merely chose the  wrong way. Seemingly, this represents a sign of weakness and not a disease.  </P> <P> JOE PIERCE  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

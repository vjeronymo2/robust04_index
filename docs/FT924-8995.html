			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Run rabbit, run rabbit, run, run, run: Cookery LOOKING up from the kitchen sink I saw an octet of pheasants within potshot, scrumping under our apple and rowan trees. An hour later a ninth bird, intent on kamikazi, dive bombed my car and splattered down on to what looked more like a tarred and feathered track than a modern Macadamised road, so many corpses were there. That was in late October. Now that November has dawned and the guns are poised to attack, the feathered fraternity has vanished as fast as a conjurer's hat. Which is why my recipe today is not for pheasant, as it might have been, but for rabbit - and farmed rabbit, at that. I used to be snooty about farmed rabbit, rating it not a patch on the real thing, but the variability of the wild sort has worn down my argument. Too many knife-blunting, jaw-aching memories of jousting with long-toothed rabbits in the kitchen and at table has taught me to appreciate the delicacy and juiciness of the farmed sort. Farmed rabbit is an asset too if you like to serve meals at an appointed hour and to synchronise the timing of dishes to go with the meat. Wild rabbit is wildly unpredictable; joints of farmed can be counted on to take just 30 minutes or so to become tender. Poaching is my preferred cooking method, chosen for several reasons. It is light work for the cook. It produces pure, low fat food which is easily digested. And the cooking liquor forms the basis for lovely soups afterwards. What is more, poached rabbit is not only delicious hot but also excellent cold and in rechauffe dishes, so much so that I usually cook more rabbit than I need for one meal with these 'extras' in mind. Cooking in quantity brings added bonuses: it intensifies the flavour and satiny texture of the cooking broth, and it means that half the cook's work for subsequent meals is done ahead, without any effort. Rabbit joints not eaten at the first meal will keep in the fridge for two or three days. Delay stripping the meat from the bone and cutting it into quills until needed. Sometimes I mix the cooked quills with sauteed mushrooms, hard-boiled eggs, ham and olives, and I bind the ingredients with a creamy light sauce and serve them under a puff pastry lid. This makes a fine rabbit pie. Sometimes I toss the quills with orange zest and toasted pinenuts, and use them to garnish a risotto. On other occasions I pack the rabbit meat into a terrine with chunks of gammon, a handful of fresh green herbs and some of the jellied poaching stock to make brawn. Cold, juicily cooked rabbit meat also makes appetising salads. I particularly like to sprinkle the quills generously over a scant bed of chicory or frizzy endive leaves, add segments of orange and tiny black Nicoise olives, and serve with a blob of mustardy mayonnaise on the side. SOUCHY OF RABBIT WITH LEEKS, POTATOES AND GARLIC Sauce: The secret of successful poaching lies in keeping the flame very low, never allowing the liquid to come anywhere near the boil. Boiling toughens meat: if the liquid becomes violently agitated - even for a minute or so - the meat will then need hours of gentle cooking to render it tender again. The cook must be on constant guard, ready to adjust the flame as necessary. The temperature should not drop so much that no steam rises when the lid is lifted from the pot, but it must be kept below simmering point so that only a very occasional bubble burps gently to the surface. To cook say 10 or 12 rabbit joints (shoulder portions are my preferred cut; legs are good; saddle is the most expensive and the driest meat), first bring at least 3 pt of liquid to boiling point. Yes, I mean boiling point in this instance. Salted water with bay leaves, a few snippets of lovage or a small bunch of coriander will do well. Light chicken stock can be used, even that made with a good quality stock cube, such as Kallo. When boiling point is reached add the meat, all at once, so the bubbling ceases instantly. Cover the pot, turn the flame right down and poach as described. After about 20 minutes add some leeks to the pot, say three for every two diners, cutting the vegetables into 2in chunks. Raise the flame slightly as their addition will cause the temparature of the liquid to plummet. After a further 10-15 minutes poaching both meat and vegetables should be cooked to perfection. Turn off the heat and if you are not ready to eat straight away, let the ingredients stand in the covered pot to keep them succulent and hot. When ready to serve, lift the rabbit and leeks out of the pot and arrange them on a dish with some separately steamed or boiled floury potatoes. Spoon on a few spoonfuls of the poaching liquor (fast boiled to intensify its flavour if necessary, and seasoned to taste). Scatter lavishly with fresh chopped coriander for the sake of its colour as well as its complementary taste. Rabbit cooked this way is juicy and tender, best enjoyed by eating in one's fingers, and most delicious when partnered with a bowl of garlicky sauce: aioli, tarator or skordalia.</p>

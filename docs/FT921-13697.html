			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / US presses growth strategy on G7 partners THE US will continue to press its economic partners to sign up for a growth strategy at this week's meeting in the US of finance ministers from the Group of Seven industrial countries. However, Bush administration officials admit they have not yet won over their European counterparts. After President George Bush and Japanese Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa declared in Tokyo earlier this month a strategy for strengthening growth in the world economy, US officials have sought to enlist the support of the European members of the G7 - Germany, France, Italy and the UK. They say there is greater recognition that their worries about the pattern of world economic growth are justified. 'I think there is acceptance of the fact that there is a growth problem,' a senior Treasury official said, noting that aggregate growth in the G7 countries was estimated to have been no higher than 1 per cent in 1991, and was forecast at 2 per cent in 1992. But the official acknowledged that Germany remained reluctant to adopt a formal growth strategy similar to the Tokyo declaration, and that the other European countries were severely constrained in their freedom to act without Germany. 'A number of countries don't have much room for manoeuvre, because of the dominating position of the Bundesbank, the D-Mark and Germany,' he said. The US is particularly pleased with the Tokyo communique, as it commits Japan to policies designed to promote economic growth through domestic demand and not expanded exports. Germany, on the other hand, has given priority to the fight against inflation and recently raised its short-term interest rates. Other European countries, such as France, might have preferred to cut rates, but place greater emphasis on the sanctity of the European monetary system's current exchange rate parities.</p>

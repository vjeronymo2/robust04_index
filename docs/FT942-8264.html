			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Debt may be written off Further debt relief for the world's poorest countries could be in the offing following a two-day meeting in Geneva of finance ministry officials from the main creditor nations, writes Frances Williams in Geneva. British officials said yesterday there was 'widespread support' for Britain's call for full implementation of the so-called Trinidad terms. These involve an immediate write-off of more than half the debt owed to governments by highly-indebted low-income countries, mostly in Africa. Total public bilateral debt owed by severely-indebted low-income countries topped Dollars 110bn in 1992, up from Dollars 80bn in 1986.</p>

			<p><P> July 6, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> GAY N.Y. COUPLE RULED A 'FAMILY' IN RENTAL LEASE  </P> <P> New York's highest court ruled today that a partner in a long-term homosexual  relationship can take over the couple's rent-controlled apartment when the  lover who signed the lease dies.  </P> <P> In a 4-2 ruling, the Court of Appeals ordered a lower court to reconsider its  decision to evict a New York City man from a rent-controlled apartment he  shared for a decade with his now-dead lover.  </P> <P> In doing so, the court expanded the definition of a "family" as it applies to  New York's rent-control laws. The word is crucial because state law says only  "family members" may take over rent-controlled apartments when the tenant of  record dies. The court said that the definition should include adults who show  long-term financial and emotional commitment to each other, even if they do not  fit the traditional meaning of a "family."  </P> <P> Today's decision is the first time any top state court in the nation has  recognized a gay couple to be the legal equivalent of a family, according to  American Civil Liberties Union lawyer William Rubenstein, who argued the case.  </P></p>

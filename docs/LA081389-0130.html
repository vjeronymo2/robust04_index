			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR SOME, 'PARENTHOOD' IS NO LAUGHING MATTER  </P> <P> Some comments on Nina J. Easton's July 30 article about the Ron Howard's film  "Parenthood," which, according to the headline, "reflects the movies' latest  discovery: kids and families."  </P> <P> Brian Grazer, Howard's partner in Imagine Films, is quoted as saying: "Now  being hip is being a responsible dad. . . . It's hip to have substance."  </P> <P> Hip? He makes child rearing sound like the latest dance step.  </P> <P> 'Hip to have substance" now? Does that mean that a short time ago it was "hip  to be superficial"?  </P> <P> I hope that reading Grazer's remarks doesn't provoke a bunch of folks to rush  out and become parents so they too can share in the "hip" experience. Just as  bell-bottom pants and alligator-emblem shirts went speedily out, so might this  latest craze.  </P> <P> And when a child no longer serves a desire for hipness, what do you say to  little Mary or Johnny? "Sorry, kid, but you're out of style"?  </P> <P> LAUREL DEWEY  </P> <P> Glendale  </P></p>

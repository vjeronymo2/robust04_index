			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Troubled electrical chain continues trading Clydesdale Group, the Glasgow-based electrical retail chain which went into receivership on Friday night, is to continue trading while receivers follow up expressions of interest from potential buyers. The company was defeated by persistent under-capitalisation, poor sales and a costly expansion programme in England, according to one of the receivers, Mr Malcolm Shierson of accountants Grant Thornton. Clydesdale claimed to have the third-largest share of the UK electrical goods retail market, after Dixons and Comet. The board of Clydesdale asked a consortium of four banks - Bank of Scotland, Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays and NM Rothschild - to call in receivers after they refused to provide an emergency funding package of Pounds 4m. The banks are owed about Pounds 35m, of which nearly half is owed to Royal Bank. Total debts have not been quantified. The company had resorted to the banks after attempts to raise money from its main shareholders, led by Standard Life and Scottish Amicable, had failed. The joint receivers, Mr Shierson, Mr Allan Griffiths and Mr Donald McGruther, have arranged for the group to continue trading for the time being. They have secured support from the banks, from Cornhill Insurance - which will underwrite the product warranties - and from British Midland airline, which will continue honouring cheap flight vouchers from Clydesdale customers. Mr Griffiths said the receivers had already received three expressions of interest from large organisations and expected to receive more. The receivers intended to sell the group as a whole. It is likely to appeal to electricity companies anxious to expand their retail network. Clydesdale, which employs about 1,500 people, has about 100 high street stores in Scotland and 20 out-of-town stores in England. In the year to March 31 1993 it had sales of Pounds 141m on which it made an operating profit of Pounds 5.6m. Last June it abandoned a flotation after an audit by Arthur Andersen revealed that stock had been overvalued. Mr Jim Boyd, finance director, left the company. The failure of the flotation, which would have raised Pounds 30m, meant that the group's problems of under-capitalisation intensified. The expansion programme had been based on the assumption that the recession was ending and that the flotation would proceed. Over the weekend Royal Bank of Scotland angrily rejected accusations by Mr Henk van Eck, Clydesdale's chief executive, that it had blocked the bank rescue package. It said the members of the syndicate were unanimous in refusing to advance the Pounds 4m. Mr van Eck, a company rescue specialist, joined Clydesdale in 1985, taking 51 per cent of the shares.</p>

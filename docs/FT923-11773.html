			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / People: Sir Bryan takes the tractor hot seat Sir Bryan Nicholson, chairman and chief executive of the Post Office, is to be the next chairman of Varity Holdings, the UK maker of Massey Ferguson tractors and Perkins diesel engines. He takes up his new post in January and will also join the board of Varity Corporation, the US parent. Sir Bryan, 60, will fill a post which has been vacant since Michael Bird, Varity's long-serving UK chairman, died last year. Sir Bryan had announced some time ago that he intended to step down as a full-time chairman and chief executive of the Post Office when his contract expires in October. He has already agreed to take on the chairmanship of BUPA, the UK's leading independent health care organisation, but he had indicated that he would stay on as a part-time chairman of the Post Office until March 1993. His decision to take the Varity job will put further pressure on the government to pick a successor. There is growing speculation that the authorities will use the opportunity to split the job of chairman and chief executive of the Post Office, Britain's biggest nationalised industry. Before joining the PO in 1987, Sir Bryan had been chairman of the Manpower Services Commission for three years. However, he has spent the bulk of his career in international business, having started as a Unilever management trainee in 1955.</p>

			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Croatia wakes up to war hangover SEVERAL European Community countries will today recognise the independence of Croatia after a six-month war in which thousands have been killed, 600,000 people have been made homeless, and entire villages and towns have been destroyed throughout the republic. But many Croats feel that despite international recognition, the war which led to the occupation, backed by President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, of a third of Croatia's territory by the federal army has not yet ended. They also believe that efforts to rebuild the republic's fragile democratic institutions must go hand-in-hand with regaining all its territory. 'As long as Croatia has no control over its entire territory, it will be difficult to build democracy,' says Mr Zarko Pukovski, a sociologist at Zagreb University. 'As long as Mr Franjo Tudjman, the president of Croatia, talks about expanding the borders into part of Bosnia-Hercegovina if that republic breaks up, Croatia could remain unstable.' With the help of United Nations troops, who are expected to be sent to Croatia if recommended by the 50 UN liaison officers who arrived yesterday, government officials in Zagreb believe stability is now possible. But many Croats argue that the war has created such an atmosphere of revenge that the chance of peaceful co-existence between Serbs and Croats is slim. Desperate to create stability to attract foreign investment and rebuild the economy, the Croat authorities must try to dilute hatred so as to prevent local acts of reprisals against the Serbs, to build democracy, and to regain full control of lost territory. Mr Mario Nobilo, an adviser to Mr Tudjman, insisted yesterday that not one inch of territory would be ceded to Serbia as the price of stability. He believes that the presence of UN troops, and the latest ceasefire, will have an enormous psychological affect on Croats. 'If the killing and the fighting stops, this will make it easier to build a democratic future,' he said. But even the UN cannot guarantee a totally peaceful future. Nationalist paramilitaries, for example, have sprung up on both sides during the war and Mr Pukovski fears that, on a local level, 'people will start disappearing, and the institutions of public accountability and rule of law will not be strong enough to stop this'. Fear of reprisals runs through the Serb and Croat communities. Croats were once in the majority in some of the mixed villages, but were forced out of parts of eastern Slavonia, eastern Croatia. They will not return as long as Mr Goran Hadzik, head of the local militant Serbs, who is backed by Mr Milosevic and the army, remains in power. Nor will Croats return to Krajina, south-western Croatia, as long as Mr Milan Babic, head of the Serbian self-proclaimed republic, controls the region with the help of the army. Many Serbs from western Slavonia, which Croatia has regained from the federal army, will stay away for fear of reprisals. 'Of course it will take time for Croats to return there,' said Mr Nobilo. 'But with UN help, and that of the international community, we can establish confidence-building measures and restore our republic's territorial integrity.' Whether this is true remains to be seen. Mr Robert Badinter, a member of the arbitration commission set up by the EC-sponsored peace conference, warned recently that Serbian and Croatian leaders had stoked a frightening hatred between their peoples, resurrecting age-old feuds. 'It will leave such profound hatred among the peoples and minorities. . . (there) will be a permanent source of terrorism long after peace has been restored.'</p>

"I am firmly convinced that the worst of recession is now  behind us," Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi wrote in his  contribution to the report, adding: "I believe...that the  turning point came at the beginning of last autumn and that  signs of recovery in production have emerged since then."  Ciampi also renewed his encouragement to foreign investors, "to  have trust" in Italy, in its parliament, which has done a  "tremendous" amount of work, and in the government, which has  worked in a "concrete" fashion.    According to Treasury Minister Piero Barucci, Italy is "on  the right tack" and now needs to "turn on the engines to push it  forward." In his statements for the "Spring Report," Barucci  also said that the new parliament to be elected next week and  the new government that will follow "have only one road to  follow, and there are no others," referring to austerity  measures put in place to reduce the deficit, contain inflation  and cut spending. Barucci also placed the poorer southern  regions, indebtedness and unemployment as three main agenda  items for future executives and parliaments.    Luigi Abete, head of the private employers' association,  Confindustria [General Confederation of Italian Industry], in  his statements warned against reducing working hours in an  attempt to save jobs and suggested shifting taxes from capital  and labor to consumption and distributed wages. Abete also  asked future legislators to provide "political stability" and  "consistent rules" to ensure growth and warned that the goal of  stabilizing the ratio between debt and gross domestic product  may not be reached in the next three years.    For his part, Finance Minister Franco Gallo spoke of  so-called fiscal federalism, in which regions are given greater  autonomy in setting and collecting taxes, saying that it must be  "treated seriously and gradually." He also suggested possible  changes to the current tax system.    The "Spring Report" defines unemployment as the single most  important issue of the year, noting that for the first time ever  the seven major industrialized countries have held a special  meeting to discuss jobs.    The report noted that unemployment in Italy gradually rose  from 7.7 percent in 1979 to 11 percent early this year, and  suggested where to focus energies: research and technological  development; professional training; a more flexible job market;  expansion of so-called industrial districts; improving the  credit system.</p>

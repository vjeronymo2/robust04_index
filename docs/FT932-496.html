			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Rules tightened on van exhaust PASSENGER vans and light goods vehicles in the European Community will have to be fitted with catalytic converters from next year, environment ministers decided yesterday. This will bring them into line with exhaust emission controls on cars and lorries. Ministers were also aiming to reach a political deal setting even more stringent emission targets for cars for 1996 and 2000, which carmakers say would add 5 per cent to manufacturing costs. The emissions regime for cars, in force since January, is now extended to new models of van from October, and all newly registered vans from October 1994. It covers passenger vehicles carrying up to nine people and goods vehicles under 3.5 tonnes. Broadly, current standards seek to cut emissions of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons and carbon particulates by 85-90 per cent from 1970 levels. Only the Dutch dissented on the vans decision, but from a 'greener' standpoint. The Netherlands, along with Germany and Denmark, want more generous fiscal incentives for cleaner cars than now allowed in order to cut emissions faster. Britain, France, Spain and others fear too big 'green' tax discounts could distort competition in the EC's single market. Though there is consensus on the European Commission's approach to cutting vehicle emissions, disagreement over fiscal incentives loomed as a barrier to an early accord. Ministers also agreed on measures to control emissions from petrol distribution and vehicle refuelling, and were due to discuss better fuel quality as part of the new generation of emission controls. There was hope, too, of agreement today on reducing emissions such as sulphur dioxide and hydrogen chloride and fluoride, through cleaner burning of industrial waste. This could imply the upgrading of all existing incineration facilities within three years.</p>

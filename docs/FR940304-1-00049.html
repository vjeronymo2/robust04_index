			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> BSC claims that due to consistent manufacturing and waste treatment processes, the analytical data obtained from the two sampling events are representative of any variation in the chemically stabilized wastewater treatment filter cake constituent concentrations. BSC further explained in its petition that the samples collected in January and February 1992 represent filter cake generated specifically when different combinations of the three plating lines were operating.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Agency Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> BSC used SW&hyph;846 Method 7000 to quantify the total constituent concentrations of arsenic, barium, cadmium, lead, nickel, selenium, silver, and zinc in the filter cake samples. BSC used an Agency approved Bethlehem Steel Standard Method <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  to quantify the total constituent concentration of chromium in the filter cake samples. BSC used SW&hyph;846 Method 3060 to digest the samples, and then followed Method 7195 to analyze/quantify hexavalent chromium concentrations in the dewatered (unstabilized) filter cake samples. BSC used ``Determination of Mercury in Water By Gold-Film Analyzer'', to quantify the total constituent concentration of mercury in the filter cake samples. BSC used SW&hyph;846 Method 9010 to quantify the total constituent concentration of cyanide in the filter cake samples. BSC used ``Methods for Chemical Analysis of Water and Wastes'' Method 376.1 to quantify the total constituent concentration of sulfide in the filter cake samples.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Bethlehem Steel Standard Method. ``Methods of Sampling and Analysis Vol. I Iron and Steel'' - Chromium by the Persulfate Oxidation Method. Additional descriptive information about this method is included in the RCRA public docket for today's notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Using SW&hyph;846 Method 9071, BSC determined that its stabilized filter cake had a maximum oil and grease content of 0.099 percent; therefore, the leachate analyses did not have to be modified in accordance with the Oily Waste EP methodology (i.e., wastes having more than one percent total oil and grease may either have significant concentrations of constituents of concern in the oil phase, which may not be assessed using the standard leachate procedures, or the concentration of oil and grease may be sufficient to coat the solid phase of the sample and interfere with the leaching of metals from the sample).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> BSC used SW&hyph;846 Method 1310 (EP)/Method 7000 to quantify the EP leachable concentrations of arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury, nickel, and silver in the filter cake samples, and used modified SW&hyph;846 Method 1310 (using distilled waster, instead of acetate buffer, in the extraction) and Method 9010 to quantify the EP leachable concentration of cyanide in cured stabilized samples. BSC used SW&hyph;846 Method 1311 (TCLP)/Method 7000 to quantify the TCLP leachable concentrations of arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury, nickel, and silver in the filter cake samples. BSC used SW&hyph;846 Method 1320 (MEP)/Method 7000 to quantify the MEP leachable concentrations of the TC metals (except for barium and selenium) and nickel in the cured stabilized filter cake.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Table 1 presents the maximum total constituent concentrations of the eight TC metals, nickel, cyanide, zinc, and sulfide for the dewatered (unstabilized) filter cake and stabilized filter cake.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Unions attack Dorrell inflation claim: Public-sector workers will need increases of at least 3 per cent in 1994-95 merely to maintain their standards of living, say pay analysts THE SUGGESTION from Mr Stephen Dorrell, the financial secretary to the Treasury, that Britain has become an 'inflation-free' economy without the need for annual pay rises was dismissed as premature yesterday by pay bargainers representing both employers and employees. Pay analysts, such as Mr Chris Trinder of the Public Finance Foundation, say that public-sector workers will need pay rises of at least 3 per cent in 1994-95 merely to maintain living standards, taking account of the expected inflation rate, the increase in National Insurance and increases in VAT on fuel. But according to one senior Whitehall official Mr Dorrell and the government are taking advantage of fortuitous circumstances to deliver another blow to the inflationary expectations that still haunt Britain's pay bargaining system. The official said: 'What better time to turn the screw when you have a recovering economy, low inflation, and cowed public-sector workers?' The Confederation of British Industry, which for the second year running has had an important influence on public pay policy, also stresses the continuing downward pressure on pay in the private sector and the lack of 'catch-up' in those companies emerging from pay freezes. The shorter-term objectives of a second year of pay control in the public sector are twofold - to keep the tightest possible control on public spending while escaping the straitjacket of this year's 1.5 per cent limit. Two of the most telling criticisms of the 1.5 per cent limit for 1993-94 were that it would be difficult to come out of, and that it was holding up the introduction of more flexible private-sector-style pay arrangements in the public sector. The shift to a policy of zero growth in pay bills, with pay rises coming from productivity increases, allows that flexibility. Indeed Mr Jack Dromey, the senior local government negotiator for the TGWU general union, said that the government's 'hidden agenda' was to encourage a further break-up of national bargaining in the public sector with very low - or zero - national rises supplemented by local productivity deals. However, there remain problems ahead for the new pay policy. Mr Charles Nolda, head of negotiations at the Local Government Management Board, said that any significant pay increase might have to be paid for by cuts in services and therefore jobs. He pointed to the difficulty in imposing restraint in the public sector without similar restraint in the private sector. Mr Alistair Hatchett, of Incomes Data Services, said many pay rises in the private sector had been bought at the expense of high job-shedding. If the same trend was to emerge in the public sector 'unemployment could soon be back over 3m'. There is also a looming conflict between the government's new policy and the various independent mechanisms for setting pay in the public sector - in particular the pay review bodies, which cover about 1.5m workers from judges to nurses, and the indexing formulas covering not only special groups such as firefighters and police but also civil servants. It appears that the pay review bodies will continue to make recommendations for 1994-95 - unlike for the current year's 1.5 per cent limit - but many people sitting on the review bodies are already disgruntled and some may resign if they feel that they are being overruled again. A broader problem is the growing divergence between public- and private-sector pay that a second year of restraint would produce, and the effect that would have on the ability of the public sector to recruit and retain the workers and managers it needs. Average pay in the public sector is higher than the private sector because there are more white-collar workers in the public sector. When comparing similar jobs, pay in the private sector is usually higher than in the public sector except for the low-paid and women workers.</p>

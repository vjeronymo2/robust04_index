			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WOO, BRADLEY JOIN FORCES TO OPPOSE FRYMAN CANYON DEVELOPMENT  </P> <P> Mayor Tom Bradley and Councilman Mike Woo teamed up Thursday to try to halt a  proposed 26-home development above Studio City that would result in filling up  a canyon and the burial of one of the few year-round streams in the Hollywood  Hills .  </P> <P> The pair urged city Department of Building and Safety officials to re-evaluate  their 1988 decision to issue a grading permit to Fred Sahadi, the developer of  the 63-acre site in Fryman Canyon, and warned Sahadi that they would seek to  halt his project under federal laws that protect year-round streams.  </P> <P> Woo, in whose district the proposed development is located, called Fryman  Canyon an irreplaceable wilderness area. The canyon is located near a lookout  point along Mulholland Drive that offers a panoramic view of the city below.  </P> <P> Bradley planning deputy Jane Blumenfeld said the mayor is hopeful the Santa  Monica Mountains Conservancy, a public agency committed to acquiring parkland  in the hills, will be able to buy the canyon from Sahadi, a Century City-based  developer. She said Joe Edmiston, executive director of the conservancy,  reportedly has met with Sahadi about the property.  </P> <P> A conservancy purchase of the site would "be an ideal solution," Blumenfeld  said. Edmiston could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> "This project has been in the works for nine years, and it has been through 23  public hearings," Sahadi said. "This is serious business." He would not comment  further on the Bradley-Woo efforts to checkmate it.  </P> <P> The discovery that a year-round stream runs through the canyon was a  breakthrough for the foes of Sahadi's project. Under the federal Clean Water  Act, any project that would endanger or adversely effect a year-round stream  first must obtain a permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Blumenfeld  said.  </P> <P> To obtain the permit requires the filing of a environmental impact report.  Preparing such a report would entail costly delays. In addition, Blumenfeld  said, she was confident an environmental report would recommend against the  Sahadi project.  </P> <P> As now planned, that project would require channeling the Fryman Canyon stream  into a pipe and then the burial of the pipe under thousands of tons of earth as  the canyon is filled in.  </P></p>

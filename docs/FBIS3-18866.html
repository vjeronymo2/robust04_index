			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Opinion Poll -- Prime Minister </F> Falling but Still in Lead"]    [Text] Edouard Balladur, with a confidence rating of 54  percent, has dropped 7 percent, whereas President Francois  Mitterrand has gone up 2 percent to 40 percent in the latest  monthly opinion poll carried out by SOFRES [French Opinion Poll  Institute] for LE FIGARO-MAGAZINE. Fifty-four percent of people  questioned trust Mr. Balladur "to solve the problems facing  France," compared with 61 percent in the previous poll.  Forty-three percent (an increase of 6 percent) do not trust him.    The head of state has the confidence of 40 percent (as  against 38 percent previously), whereas 57 percent (down 3  percent) of people questioned say they do not have confidence in  him. Fifty-eight percent want the current prime minister "to  play an important role in the coming months." Despite a drop of  5 percent, Mr. Balladur is still ahead of other prominent  right-wing figures -- Charles Pasqua (51 percent, down 3  percent), Simone Veil (50 percent, up 1 percent). Jacques  Chirac remains stable at 37 percent, Raymond Barre drops 2  percent to 36 percent, and Valery Giscard d'Estaing goes up 1  percent to 27 percent.    On the Left, Jacques Delors remains in the lead with 55  percent (up 2 percent) of people questioned wanting him to play  "an important role," ahead of Jack Lang (47 percent) and Michel  Rocard (38 percent) who both remain stable.    This opinion poll was carried out from 19 through 23  February  on a national sample of 1,000 representative members of the  population over the age of 18, and chosen according to the quota  method.</p>

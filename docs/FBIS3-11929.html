This is the basic and consensual analysis  conclusion diplomats from industrialized countries sent to  Washington, Paris, London, and Bonn in the last 48 hours. They  stated that the institutional crisis -- apparently prompted by a  minor administrative issue (salaries) -- served to consolidate  the return of the Armed Forces to the decision-making focal  point of the political power.    There is the possibility of extreme military intervention: a  coup entailing the closure of Congress and the Federal Supreme  Court, which are the targets of the executive branch. The  analysts noted that this possibility is part of the scenario,  albeit remote.    One fact considered most relevant in all reports sent abroad  was the comment by Admiral Arnaldo Leite, chief of the Armed  Forces Joint Staff, who said the highest judicial court had  adopted an "illegal" administrative decision: It converted its  payroll into URV's [Real Value Units] on the day it paid its  personnel.    Information collected at Congress, the presidency of the  Republic, Itamaraty, and military units, show that diplomats  have been trying since the beginning of the week to evaluate the  course of the crisis under the perspective of elections and the  constitutional reform. They are unable to answer questions that  are being discussed in Congress, like: Although part of the  military is willing to stage a coup with the discreet support of  some important civilians, would a "strong" government have any  legitimacy following an armed intervention?    Apparently, the military chiefs are more intent on exerting  governmental tutelage -- like betting on the future  (presidential succession) -- than on trying to establish the  conditions for a dictatorship based on a model instituted 30  years ago. The domestic and international scenario, apparently,  would not look favorable on them under either possibility. They  could lack legitimacy at home. A poll conducted in Sao Paulo by  Toledo and Associates was published yesterday by O ESTADO. It  shows that only 1.1 percent of those interviewed believe  "military action" is necessary to solve the crisis.    The main international obstacle to intensifying military  intervention in Brazilian politics would be the U.S.  Government's alleged desire to prevent nationalist movements in  the Southern Hemisphere from taking power because they could  eventually oppose the development of U.S. strategic interests in  emerging Latin American economies.    At the beginning of the week -- with the crisis in full  swing  -- U.S. Vice President Al Gore visited President Itamar Franco  to confirm his government's Another issue shared by foreign  analysts and Brazilian congressmen -- to which no one has yet  found an answer -- is as follows: If the hypothesis of a coup is  unrealistic, what possibility is there for Brazil to make its  democratic process logical and functional during the closing  stages of the Franco administration with a strong military  presence at the epicenter of political decisions?    Also highlighted among the common points of the evaluation  by foreign embassies in Brasilia as well as Congress was the  level of frustration felt by middle-ranking military officers  who were aroused by demonstrations of force by the Army, Navy,  and Aeronautics commanders last week, and which was publicly  endorsed by the president of the Republic.    The consensual conclusion is that the "coup" -- in other  words, military intervention in the political decisions process  -- tends to become consolidated in the day-to-day routine under  President Franco's sponsorship. This domestic atmosphere would  be favorable because we are witnessing a virtual dismantling of  the institutions.    Itamar Franco -- The president's feeling has been in keeping  with that of the military. He recently became irritated by the  legislative and judicial branches' decision to raise their own  salaries. He believes this is the most serious crisis his  government has experienced so far, but promises to continue to  abide by "the law and the Constitution."    Octavio Gallotti -- The STF [Supreme Federal Court]  president  has changed his habit of talking little. He issues daily  official declarations and upheld the court justices' decision to  convert their salaries into URV's on 20 March. He shows little  desire to negotiate, insisting that the "STF abides by the law"  and upholds the autonomy of the judicial branch.    Fernando Henrique Cardoso -- After negotiating the  provisional measure to create the URV with the STF, the minister  was taken by surprise by the crisis. Like Itamar, he canceled  transfering funds to cover the salary increases. The more  difficult.    Inocencio Oliveira -- The president of the Chamber of  Deputies has become the mediator in the crisis. He failed in his  first attempt to overcome the impasse between the executive and  legislative branches, proposing that the salaries of the public  servants be transformed into URV's on 25 March. He promised to  annul the session during which the deputies approved the salary  increase.    Humberto Lucena -- The Senate president changed his mind  after trying to get the vote on the salary increase for  legislators included in the order of the day. He has  participated in meetings to overcome the crisis and asked  President Itamar to become involved in the negotiations. He  still criticizes Itamar and Cardoso.    Ivan Serpa -- The Navy minister has become the spokesman of  the military unrest. He called the legislative and judicial  branches salary increase "immoral." He believes the government  must not yield to "pressure" or it will become the "slave" of  other branches.</p>

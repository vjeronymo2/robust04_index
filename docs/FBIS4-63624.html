			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] According to the head of the presidential expert  team, renowned economist Aleksandr Livshits, the current  situation in Russia is very much alike that in December 1991.  Like then, the political situation is quite stable and  favorable for reform. The main goal in the economic sphere now  should be to stabilize the consumer market and prevent the  industries from a collapse, he told a briefing in the Kremlin  Monday.    On behalf of the Russian president, Livshits said that the  head of the state had signed a package of five decrees called to  impose order in the production sphere. Livshits pointed out  that Boris Yeltsin fulfilled his constitutional duties and his  obligations under the Social Accord Treaty by signing these  documents.    According to the first decree, Russian exports will not be  quoted or licensed as of July 1 1994, except for those under  interstate agreements already concluded.    The second decree deals with taxation. Taxes currently paid  by enterprises are expected to be cut down by about 10-20  percent. Simultaneously, the government was asked to consider  restructuring taxes paid by individuals. The decree envisions  privileged taxation for enterprises with foreign capital  provided they produce goods within Russia.    The third decree is devoted to the reformation of  state-owned  enterprises. According to this decree, no more federal  enterprises entirely owned by the state will be set up. Part of  state-owned enterprises will fall into administration. Their  directors will enjoy limited rights but will bear full  responsibility for their activities. Livshits emphasized that  employees of such enterprises would have proper social  guarantees. He made clear that such enterprises would be set up  on the basis of enterprises not liable to privatization and at  the same time poorly managed.    Livshits drew journalists' attention to the decree on  additional measures to normalize payments defining the sequence  in which payments from an enterprise's current accounts should  be made. If an enterprise is short of rubles, it will have to  cover the debt with hard currency. To implement the measure, a  federal bill chamber will be created.    The fifth decree is devoted to strengthening the taxation  discipline. Legal entities found guilty of dodging taxes for  the first time will be imposed a huge fine. After a second  attempt, the enterprise will be closed. Livshits pointed out  that the decree also envisioned a mechanism for speeding up the  consideration of enterprises' suits to each other.    Another decree the president signed today is not directly  concerned with the perfection of industrial relations as it  provides for the consolidation of means of the road construction  fund in the federal budget.    Livshits categorically dismissed the possibility of any  limitations of freedom on the Russian market by the  above-mentioned decrees. "These documents are called only to  impose basic order in the production sphere. The only freedom  infringed upon is the freedom to steal as much as before," he  was quoted as saying.    According to Livshits, the package will allow to do away  with  the poor management of the state-owned sector. He said it was  impossible to endure any longer such abuses as one's leasing  state property to oneself or use of state funds for other  purposes.    In an answer to journalists' questions, Livshits stressed  that the package was only the first step the president made to  protect the Russian industries. "We hope a second one will  follow," he said.    Livshits pointed to the important part to be played by the  government and parliament to make the decrees work since the  very first day.</p>

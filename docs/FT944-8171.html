			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of Germany (23): Ambitious rivals for the big prize / Profile of Mannesmann's Peter Mihatsch and Telekom's Helmut Ricke When Mr Peter Mihatsch looks out of his first floor office in Dusseldorf he has an inspiring view of the river Rhine. Vast concrete and steel bridges tower over Europe's mightiest river which flows north as far as the eye can see. It is an inspiring view and leaves one feeling spectator in little doubt that the world is there for the taking. In Bonn, Mr Helmut Ricke has a far less interesting view - a cityscape of small office blocks and detached houses. The different views from their offices reflect their contrasting styles. Mr Mihatsch heads the telecommunications division at Mannesmann, the first German company to take on Deutsche Telekom, the State-owned telecoms operator run by Mr Ricke which is soon to be privatised. Both men have ambitious plans. Mr Mihatsch's operation is tiny compared with Telekom, but he is looking to expand it rapidly. Mr Ricke, on the other hand, has taken Telekom into joint ventures across Europe and the globe, but knows that as competition from companies such as Mannesmann intensifies, Telekom, which still largely enjoys a monopoly, will stand to lose. In 1990, Mr Mihatsch moved from Mannesmann Kienzle, a company which makes equipment for commercial vehicles and is part of Mannesmann, the engineering and automotive technology group, one of Germany's top 20 companies in sales terms. He was charged with setting up Germany's first private mobile phone network, a bold new venture for a company which had become almost synonymous with steel piping. It has been a startling success and set an example which others are racing to follow. The division is expected to report sizeable earnings for 1994, the first full year in profit. Sales are expected to top DM1.5bn for the year, making it the fastest growing unit within the Mannesmann group. What the pipes did for the company's image pales in comparison with its profile among millions of people reached by its aggressive advertising campaign for its D2 mobile phone network. Mr Mihatsch's success has earned him a seat on the seven-strong Mannesmann management board but he seems far from excited about it. The Mr Ricke chooses his words more carefully. He has to avoid upsetting the government ministers who are his masters or provoking the powerful trade unions. During a discussion about the needs of Germany's rapidly changing telecommunications industry, he pauses to consider the exact title of the new law that will be needed. The contrasting style also reflects the fact that whereas Mr Mihatsch only has around 2,500 employees, Mr Ricke has to lead 224,000 people, many of whom realise that they may lose their jobs as Telekom is privatised. Before moving to Telekom in 1990, Mr Ricke spent 12 years running Loewe Opta, a leading manufacturer of telecoms equipment. He had, for a while, been a member of the technical council which advised Telekom and was singled out by the then post minister to take over as chief executive. The job has often been described as one of the most difficult in Germany, requiring the incumbent to dodge and weave among political minefields and showdowns with the unions while all the time ensuring that Telekom is as well placed as possible to tap a fast-moving market in which the competition becomes ever fiercer. The State's responsibility to run the telephone network used to be enshrined in the Constitution. So even the Constitution had to be changed earlier this year. The mentality at Telekom has also had to change. When Mr Ricke took over, the supervisory board - which oversees the management board - frequently found itself debating whether Telekom's national and international plans were constitutional or not. Such distractions are no longer necessary and Telekom has been transformed beyond recognition. It will become a joint stock company on January 1, 1995 and is expected to be listed on the stock exchange early in 1996. It used to be a company focused entirely on Germany and supplied mainly by German telecoms manufacturers such as Siemens; now around 28 per cent of the suppliers come from outside Germany. Customer service should also improve now that most Telekom employees are no longer civil servants. Telekom has ambitious plans for international expansion: together with France Telecom it has a joint venture with Sprint, the US long distance carrier; it has taken a stake in MATAV, the Hungarian telecoms operator; has interests in the Ukraine and may become involved in the Czech Republic. Turnover is forecast to reach DM80bn by 2000, up from the DM69bn planned for next year. Yet while others are looking forward to capturing market share, Telekom, the one-time monopolist, has to give it up. If Mannesmann and other operatorshave their way, Mr Ricke or his successor will have to surrender the cable television network to an independent company which would allow equal access for all competitors. Even if Telekom keeps the network, the European Commission is at some point likely to allow competition from the so-called corporate networks, alternative nets built on the infrastructure which big companies such as utilities have available. Following the success of the D2 mobile phone network, Mr Mihatsch is weighing up what he might do next. That seems to be is style: when he finished studying electronic engineering in Munich he rush into industry but preferred to do research work on plasma physics. 'I wanted to step back a bit and get a better overall picture,' he says. Like Mr Ricke, he is looking abroad - to see where he can use the D2 know-how elsewhere in Europe and where Mannesmann and its partners can supply new networks.</p>

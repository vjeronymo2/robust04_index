			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Corporate convalescence: Industry is beginning to benefit from a period of radical restructuring Mr Edzard Reuter, 66, has seen winter turning to spring often enough not to place too much faith in the appearance of the odd swallow. 'We are not succumbing to any illusions despite the large number of positive indicators,' the chairman of Daimler-Benz, said recently. Germany's biggest industrial group was on the road to recovery after a 'truly devastating' 1993 when a record DM1.8bn loss obliged the group to cut its dividend for the first time since the second world war, he said. 'But our confidence is not based on a somewhat naive hope for an upturn in economic activity,' he added. By his reckoning, German exports would increase slightly this year, but the rate of expansion would lag behind the overall growth in world trade. Germany, he believed, could continue to lose share in its traditional markets. Mr Reuter's view that Daimler's brightening expectations are due entirely to attempts to raise productivity and competitiveness through its own restructuring efforts, is widely echoed elsewhere in German industry. The difference in emphasis between business opinion and the more cheerful forecasts from Mr Gunter Rexrodt, economics minister, may be explained in several ways. Industrialists feel proclaiming an end to the bad times now - while costs and jobs are still being savagely axed - could risk resurgent demands from unions which have so far accepted real wage cuts and the loss of most of the jobs created in the late 1980s. More important, while Mr Rexrodt and his coalition colleagues are facing a hectic election timetable in the next few months, German industry's restructuring agenda stretches ahead, beyond this October's federal poll. In the short term, company results will benefit because most of the financial provisions for restructuring this year and next have already been set aside. But as Deutsche Bank board director Mr Ulrich Cartellieri has said, nobody should be tempted to draw any false conclusions. Domestic demand was dead, and even if exports rose 5 per cent this year, the increase would not compensate for last year's 10 per cent decline, he noted. Recent data present a muddy picture which by most expert reckonings shows the German economy bumping sideways along the bottom of recession. The VDA automotive industry association, gloomier than most, recently said car output in the first quarter of this year fell 4 per cent below last year's already miserable levels. The motor industry, Germany's top export earner, is still stuck in the trough of the recession, it added. However, there has been more encouraging news from the chemicals and engineering branches, the country's two other main industrial motors, which help confirm the impression of an exports-driven crabwise shift in the economy. Mr Manfred Schneider, president of the VCI chemicals industry association, notes a return to stability on the strength of a rise in first-quarter sales from DM41.9bn to DM42.7bn. Hoechst yesterday confirmed the trend, attributing a 16 per cent increase in first-quarter pre-tax profits to improved business abroad. The Siemens electrical and engineering group this week reported flat turnover and profits for the first half of the current year (after adjustment for acquisitions), mainly because a 13 per cent rise in foreign sales compensated for a further 9 per cent decline at home. Brightest of all, Mercedes-Benz yesterday claimed to be beating the general decline in the car market with a 28 per cent rise in first-quarter turnover and increases of between 30 per cent and 46 per cent in registrations in all its main markets. The patchy pick-up in other European economies, which currently absorb 60 per cent of Germany's industrial exports, and the recovery in the US, which takes a further 10 per cent, appear to have enough pulling power to lift German industry out of its worst slump since 1945. But the experience of the recession has taught lessons about over-reliance on exports to over-supplied local markets which have far wider implications for the longer term, particularly more globalised manufacturing. Last year's restructuring of domestic pay agreements and deep cuts into over-blown workforces was only one response to Germany's structural difficulties. A second, potentially far-reaching response is the globalisation of Germany's traditionally home-based manufacturing capacity. Last week alone, BMW, currently building its first full-scale foreign car plant in the US, said it was planning a new factory in Mexico. On the same day Mercedes-Benz signed a joint venture to build E-Class limousines and engines in India. Attention is also focused on new possibilities in south-east Asia. Siemens chairman Mr Heinrich von Pierer this week pointed out that last year Germany invested a mere DM3.3bn in the region compared with Japan's DM70bn. As Mr von Pierer noted, if German industry fails to exploit the opportunities in south-east Asia, the world's fastest-growing region, Germany could pay a high economic price.</p>

			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MISTRIAL DECLARED IN SLAYING OF 2 IN DESERT NEAR  PALMDALE  </P> <P> The trial of a Palmdale man originally charged with executing two men in the  Mojave Desert ended in a mistrial Wednesday after jurors said they could not  agree on a verdict.  </P> <P> San Fernando Superior Court Judge Howard Schwab ordered a new trial for Brad  Millward, 30, on charges that he killed Bruce Gruber, 28, of Yucca Valley.  </P> <P> Millward was initially charged with two counts of first-degree murder for the  July 5, 1987, slayings of Gruber and Albert Dulyea, 37, of Norwalk. Last week,  however, jurors acquitted him of Dulyea's death.  </P> <P> Jury foreman Joyce Tisher said the jury split six to six on whether to convict  Millward of first-degree murder for Gruber's death. She said testimony from  ballistics experts convinced most jurors that Millward shot Gruber, but some  believed he fired in self-defense.  </P> <P> Jurors were not given the opportunity to convict Millward of a lesser charge.  Before deliberations began, Schwab instructed them that their only options were  a conviction for first-degree murder or acquittal.  </P> <P> During the four-month trial, Millward testified that Gruber and Danny Lucero,  22, of Palmdale, were trying to kill him because they believed he was a Drug  Enforcement Administration agent. Lucero was aiming for Millward when he shot  Gruber by accident, Millward said.  </P> <P> Lucero testified that he was driving home from a party when he happened upon  the crime scene, near Palmdale. He said he saw Millward shoot Gruber in the  head and flee into the desert.  </P> <P> Before jurors reported their deadlock, prosecutors, sensing the disagreement,  offered Millward a plea bargain. In exchange for a guilty plea to a reduced  count of voluntary manslaughter, he would be sentenced to 13 years. Millward,  however, maintained his innocence and refused the offer, which will stand until  Oct. 20.  </P></p>

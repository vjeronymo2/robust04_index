			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: IBM seeks Dollars 500m in five-year deal INTERNATIONAL Business Machines (IBM), the large computer group, is seeking a Dollars 500m, five-year loan from European banks. The company said the complex structured deal, which was being arranged by Citibank using a Cayman Islands corporation, would be used 'to finance operations and for some customer financing'. The money was being raised by IBM France, and the sophisticated financing arrangement was 'designed to ensure that IBM gets the lowest possible cost of funds', the company said. IBM's long-term debt rating was downgraded in March by Moody's Investors Service, a leading credit rating agency, from Aaa to Aa2. S&amp;P, another rating agency, has kept its top AAA rating for IBM, but has had the company on 'negative outlook' since last August. However, IBM claims the complex method of financing is not related to Moody's downgrading of IBM's credit rating and does not signal a change of approach to raising funds. The official borrower is Abacus (Number One), a Cayman Island special purpose vehicle. Abacus is raising a five-year senior secured loan, where the Dollars 500m principal amount is fully collateralised by a five-year zero-coupon bond issued by a triple-A rated OECD sovereign or supranational entity. Citibank said it had structured the transaction so that Abacus's interest payment obligations would be serviced by interest payments from a separate loan between Citibank and IBM France. The interest margin on the loan is 37.5 basis points over the London interbank offered rate (Libor). Fees range from 30 basis points for senior managers lending Dollars 40m to 12.5 basis points for participations of Dollars 10m. IBM said the financing was not related to the company's pledge to make a Dollars 100m equity investment in Groupe Bull, the French state-owned computer maker. Citibank expected the financing to be completed by the end of May.</p>

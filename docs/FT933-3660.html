			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Price of milk 'may rise 15%' CONSUMERS in England and Wales could pay 15 per cent more for their milk when the industry goes to a free market next April, Mr Neil Davidson, group executive at Northern Foods, has warned. At the end of July the government abolished the Milk Marketing Board, which has controlled milk sales and distribution since the 1930s. The board is due to submit proposals for its re-organisation by the end of September and plans to turn itself into a voluntary co-operative. Mr Andrew Dare, chief executive of the board, has promised farmers price rises of several pence per litre for their milk if they join the board's successor, Milk Marque. He said recently that farmers in the UK should become among the highest-paid dairy producers in Europe. Mr Davidson said that the price rise would be paid for by consumers. 'Under the new system, Milk Marque looks as if it will remain a monopoly and it will impose those price rises on the marketplace. We will inevitably pass them onto consumers.' Northern Foods has set up the Northern Milk Partnership to buy directly from farmers. The company believes it will have to pay a premium above the Milk Marque price if it is to secure its supplies, as England and Wales do not produce enough milk for their own needs. Separate arrangements are being made in Scotland. MD Foods, a UK company indirectly owned by a Danish farmers' co-operative, last week sent brochures to 8,500 farmers offering to buy their milk in the new competitive marketplace. Farmers located close to processing plants are being wooed most strongly by the dairy companies, which want to buy their milk directly. But the Milk Marketing Board believes Milk Marque will still persuade between 60 per cent and 80 per cent of the dairy producers in England and Wales to stick with it. Nevertheless, Mr Clarke believes the free market will lead to a shake-out among dairy producers, with smaller and more remote farmers going out of business, and a fall in the number of farmers from 29,000 now to 20,000 by the year 2000.</p>

			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / International Company News: Purchases boost Watts Blake WATTS Blake Bearne, the clay producer where three large shareholders are looking to sell their 45 per cent stake, yesterday announced a 28 per cent profits increase helped by acquisitions in the US and Europe. Pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 5.67m to Pounds 7.25m in 1992. At the interim stage, profits were 7 per cent higher at Pounds 3.74m. Mr John Pike, managing director, said the figures were 'very pleasing. With a sale of our shares in the balance, its nice to produce results rather against the trend in our industry,' he said. The three shareholders - Ceramics Holdings, Sibelco and Quarzwerke - are all private companies controlled by overseas interests. They said the shares were for sale in January. Since then no further announcements have been made. Mr Pike said the situation was unsatisfactory since the sale did not involve the company. Turnover increased 14 per cent to Pounds 69.8m (Pounds 61.4m) with all markets except the UK recording stronger sales. In the US turnover doubled because of acquisitions. Watts uses average exchange rates and sterling's fall in value compared to the D-Mark led to exchange rate gains of about Pounds 200,000. Exchange rates should continue to help the company this year, Mr Pike said. Watts, which is the world's largest supplier of ball clay, revalued its mineral reserves during the year with the result that a surplus of Pounds 15.9m over book value was added to reserves. Earnings increased by 22 per cent to 23.1p (18.9p). A final dividend of 8p gives a total of 10.7p (9.3p), a 15 per cent advance. The shares were unchanged at 445p. COMMENT Results ahead of expectations and a timely asset revaluation should raise the asking price for the three shareholders' stake - if a buyer can be found. One has to assume the three went public with their sale plans only after failing to induce any buyers to come forward privately. Further, the fact no one appears to have expressed interest since the shares were put on the market two months ago suggests either the asking price is too high or no one wants effective control of the company. Either way, the situation is unhelpful for management and employees who are very much out of the loop. For shareholders, however, there is no harm holding on. Forecast profits for this year of Pounds 8m put the shares on just over 17 times. That is not demanding given Watts' hold over its markets and the outside chance a bid will eventually come through.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 18 (XINHUA) -- The upcoming China  visit by Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa will lay a  solid foundation for furthering Sino-Japanese economic and trade  relations.    This view was expressed both by Chinese and Japanese  officials in charge of foreign trade in an interview with XINHUA  before the Japanese premier's visit, which starts tomorrow.    Takashi Koezuka, Japanese economic counsellor in Beijing,  said that the prime minister's visit, following the recent visit  to Japan by Chinese Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji, is another  important event in the two countries' bilateral relations.    During the coming visit, the leaders of the two countries  will exchange views on bilateral relations, especially economic  and trade cooperation, and the international situation, he said.  An agreement on expanding bilateral environmental cooperation  is to be signed.    "Although no agreement on economic and trade ties will be  reached this time, deep and careful discussion on the long-term  bilateral economic and trade ties will definitely promote the  existing good ties," the counsellor said.    An official from the Chinese Ministry of Trade and Economic  Cooperation (MOFTEC) said that since the economies of the two  countries were complementary, and a historic opportunity to  further bilateral trade ties was appearing, the high-level  exchanges will promote bilateral economic and trade ties to a  new stage on the basis of last year's high record.    In 1993, Japan for the first time became China's biggest  trade partner, with a trade volume of 39 billion U.S. dollars, a  jump of 53.8 percent over the previous year.    Japan's direct investment in China increased greatly during  the same period, and its exports of technology and equipment to  China accounted for 28 percent of China's total imports, ranking  highest among China's trade partners.    The official pointed out that in China's exports to Japan,  the percentage of finished products has been increasing, but  their added value was not high enough. "If more high-value  added products are shipped over with the efforts of both sides,  the potential of expanding China's exports will be very big,"  she said.    She said she hoped that China's large trade deficit in this  bilateral trade would be reduced soon by more varied means.    With China becoming more open, more Sino-Japanese  joint-ventures and cooperative enterprises will be established,  she said. These companies will bring in a large amount of  equipment from Japan, and export their finished products to  Japan, as one way to increase bilateral trade.    She added that in order to revive its economy, Japan will  regulate its industrial structure and expand its overseas  markets. To cooperate with China, whose economy is growing  rapidly, is one of Japan's ideal solutions.    Takashi Koezuka said that China, the second biggest trade  partner of Japan, plays an important role in his country's  foreign trade. The two-way trade developed tremendously last  year though Japan's economy was in recession, so he believed  that the prospect of bilateral trade this year was bright since  Japan's economy will improve this year.    He also said that more Japanese companies are interested in  investing in China. According to a survey by the Japanese  federation of economic organizations of its member companies,  many of which are economic giants, the investment focus of most  of them is on China for the next five years, rather than on  South-East Asia, as it was in the past five years.</p>

Four heads  of state are attending this Ndjamena summit: El Hadj Omar Bongo  of Gabon, Pascal Lissouba of Congo, Ange Felix Patasse of the  Central African Republic, and Chadian President Idriss Deby, who  is UDEAC's current chairman. Equatorial Guinea was represented  at this summit by Deputy Prime Minister Do Anatolio Ndong Mba  while Cameroon was represented by (Luc Ayan), president of the  Economic and Social Council.    Opening the 29th Council of heads of state this morning at  the 15 January Palace, Chadian President Colonel Idriss Deby  called for an active solidarity within the subregional  organization to meet the numerous challenges of this time marked  by the devaluation of the CFA franc. We must safeguard the  organization so as to give it a new impetus to be able to  achieve a true economic integration. Let us listen to Chadian  President Idriss Deby as he addressed the opening session this  morning:    [Begin Deby recording] The summit of the (?Central African  Monetary Union) will be held in a few weeks, following the  summits in Dakar, Yamoussoukro [words indistinct]. This unusual  chain of meetings at the highest level demonstrates the  (?seriousness of our problems). It also shows the need to  increase our awareness and the need for a concerted approach to  current problems. Already confronted by difficult political,  economic, and social realities, our countries are now seriously  shaken by the devaluation of the CFA franc which occurred in  January 1994. The summit will offer the right opportunity to  expand our views on this great (?shock) which has hit the root  of our economies. We must use the opportunity to take a  critical look at the life of our common institution [words  indistinct] and to define future orientations. Indeed, our  summit on 6 December 1991 in Libreville adopted a program spread  over several years. Its fundamental objective was to give a new  impetus to our organization to make it an efficient tool for  economic integration. That program was the main task we tackled  during 1993 [passage indistinct] in Bata was used to deepen our  views and improve the program for the reform and [words  indistinct].    However, everything is not perfect yet. We achieved  substantial progress and our discussions continued through  seminars and workshops by experts.

The European Union also granted an assistance of 5.5 million  Units of Account, that is (?3.7 billion) CFA francs, for the  organization of transit process [words indistinct] agreed upon  by mutual consent. The financial agreement will be signed in a  few days with the Central African Republic and the UDEAC  headquarters, which is the regional coordinator for this  project. Our wish is that all these operations should take  place (?simultaneously) so as to give our people reasons for  hope and confidence in our development efforts. [end recording]  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'WHITE BADGE' OF COURAGE;  </P> <P> WRITING ABOUT COMBAT IN VIETNAM, AHN JUNGHYO FINDS INSIGHTS INTO CHANGES IN HIS  NATIVE S. KOREA  </P> <P> In another country, South Korean novelist Ahn Junghyo could have been a  peaceful sort of couch potato, watching vintage American films on television,  spending undisturbed days casting a fishing line into a quiet lake.  </P> <P> But, as the writer laments, South Korea is small -- a fourth the size of  California -- and is easily suffused with politics. Following a series of  repressive regimes, President Roh Tae Woo has instituted democratic reform, but  liberalization is precarious. Roh has ties to former strong man Chun Doo Hwan  and obligations to military friends remain; anti-American sentiment runs high  among dissidents, as does anti-establishmentarianism.  </P> <P> And so the author of "White Badge," who intended his sixth book as a heavily  autobiographical account of his experience as a soldier fighting in Vietnam,  has found himself and his book drawn into the prevailing political currents.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Politics for Survival  </P> <P> "In Korea you've got to know about politics. Your survival depends on it," says  Ahn, 47, here to promote his book, published last month by SoHo Press.  </P> <P> A noted translator, Ahn has translated 130 books into Korean, ranging from  Margaret Mitchell's "Gone With the Wind" to John Irving's "The World According  to Garp," and rewrote "White Badge" in English himself.  </P> <P> With it, he provides a significant contribution to a tiny pool of Korean  literature to appear commercially in this country.  </P> <P> In Korea, "White Badge," which refers both to the White Horse Division of the  Republic of Korea in which Ahn served and to the Asian color for mourning, was  hailed as the first major book about Korean involvement in the Vietnam War,  and, as such, has been something of a weather vane for the changing political  climate.  </P> <P> When segments of "White Badge" appeared in 1983 in the radical Korean journal  "Literature in Action," it was considered politically dangerous.  </P> <P> Opposition to Korea's Vietnam involvement was suppressed under President Park  Chung Hee and continued under Chun. Although about 300,000 Korean soldiers  fought as American allies, with more than 4,000 killed and 8,000 wounded, it  was a largely unknown war, unremembered by memorials or literature.  </P> <P> "Writers weren't free to write about the Vietnam War," Ahn says. "And in my  book, Koreans are losing battles. You couldn't imagine Koreans losing."  </P> <P> When the manuscript version of "White Badge" won a literary competition  sponsored by Hakwon, a large-circulation magazine, the publisher renounced the  contest. "He said, 'If this is published I'll get arrested, so forget it,' "  </P> <P> Ahn says. It was three more years before the story came out in book form.  </P> <P> Ironically, in the newly liberalized environment, reaction to the book has been  the contrary. Dissidents and literary critics, says Ahn, feel he should have  said more.  </P> <P> "They wanted me to have politically slanted views and write more about the  mercenary issue. But I didn't have those opinions. That wasn't my idea in  writing the book. I wanted to tell the human stories of fighting the war."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Lives for Sale'  </P> <P> In a single politically loaded passage, added for the American version, Ahn  expresses a commonly held view of Korea's military participation.  </P> <P> "The blood money we had to earn at the price of our lives fueled the  modernization and development of the country. And owing to our contribution,  the Republic of Korea, or at least a higher echelon of it, made a gigantic  stride into the world market. Lives for sale. National mercenaries."  </P> <P> "Many Koreans still feel that way," Ahn says. "We fought in Vietnam because the  Americans asked us. So we were fighting for the Americans and against Asians  who look like us. And we were paid by the American government."  </P> <P> In Ahn's novel, the narrator, a book editor in Seoul, Han Kiju, joins the army  full of soldierly fervor, only to return home from the killing as predictably  disillusioned as his American counterparts. But Han's disorientation is all the  more unsettling, for part of his own childhood has been spent as a refugee in  the Korean War.  </P> <P> Thus, in Vietnam, Han is depicted not only in combat, but also befriending "the  beautiful beggar children," a gentle widow, an elderly rural politician  hopelessly trying to save his village from a fatal evacuation. And Han, like  Ahn, recalls how he and his family previously survived by rummaging for scraps  in American military garbage pails to prepare their meals of "piggie" soup.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Painful Memories  </P> <P> The most poignant scene drawn from Ahn's childhood describes the family's  mid-winter retreat south from Seoul amid the flow of refugees fleeing advancing  Chinese troops.  </P> <P> Unable to carry his 4-year-old sister, his mother was obliged to abandon her in  a snowy field. She spread discarded layers of bedding on the snow, "set Kija  upright on them like an image of Buddha . . . wrapped her tiny hands with  woolen mufflers and put a rice ball on her right palm . . ." and, weeping,  plodded on, Ahn writes.  </P> <P> The story, like much of the author's life, has a happy finish; Ahn's sister was  retrieved by her mother and now lives in Texas with her American husband and  son. It was at her house that Ahn translated "White Badge" into English. And  here too luck held.  </P> <P> Ahn had been writing the book off and on for 13 years. He also had sent three  other novels to American publishers and had collected a discouraging sheaf of  rejection slips. "I realized there was no hope for me to get published and  maybe I had no talent for writing, I thought," he says. When he packed up and  went to Texas to translate his book he promised himself, "If I fail, I'll give  up."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sudden Change in Fortune  </P> <P> This time around, Ahn recognized that obtaining a literary agent was essential  to getting his manuscript published. Using the list of author's agents in  "Writer's Market," he found the name of David Meth, with the mention that he  was interested in Asian affairs. Ahn sent him two book chapters and the sort of  lengthy life-recounting letter that agents often are wont to file in the  wastepaper basket. But Meth responded, and from then on, says Ahn, "Everything  worked out so easily. I couldn't believe it."  </P> <P> But long before then, Ahn's American associations had developed, and, like his  feelings for Korea, become emotionally complex. The son of a carpenter, he grew  up in war-scarred Seoul, his childhood imagination nourished by the symbols of  Hollywood glamour.  </P> <P> "Many Korean children lived with the inspirations that came from American  movies," he says. "For us it was a dreamland. Cowboys were like old legendary  generals on horseback going out to beat the bad guys. The movies were so fancy,  and our reality in Korea was so miserable."  </P> <P> Later, Ahn attended the American Sogang Jesuit University in Seoul, and after  graduation many of his classmates, as well as much of his family, moved to the  United States. Besides his sister in Texas, Ahn has a sister in Detroit and a  brother who lives in Hawaii.  </P> <P> His mental index of American cultural memorabilia, which informs "White Badge,"  has been accumulated during hours of watching American movies and news shows on  Seoul's television station operated by the U.S. military.  </P> <P> "I understand American life quite well," Ahn says proudly, though this is only  his third visit to the United States.  </P> <P> </P> <P> At Home in Texas  </P> <P> Sitting in a coffee shop in Koreatown, he wears a white safari jacket and a  buttoned-down striped sports shirt, and speaks a casual American English. In  both looks and gestures he seems remarkably more Westernized than many of the  enclave of his compatriots.  </P> <P> "For them, they say, it's a town in Korea," he says of the neighborhood seen  from the window. "I think it's the Oriental character to stay together in a  very big family. Stay in one place and grow old. In some villages in Korea, the  whole village is of the same family name."  </P> <P> If there are frustrations with slow-moving traditions, however, the Korean view  of Americans is also multifaceted.  </P> <P> During the three years of the Korean War, says Ahn, "America was like a savior.  We had so little at the time while America had so much. We used to say,  'Everything American is good.' "  </P> <P> But with greater affluency and growing trade rivalry, the image of the United  States has changed.  </P> <P> "When you are a young child, your big brother is everything," says Ahn. "But  when you grow up and your big brother tries to bash you, you resist."  </P> <P> The catalyst for anti-American sentiment was, Ahn believes, a media event,  following the Kwangju massacre. Under the government of Chun Doo Hwan, hundreds  of citizens were killed and injured during the 1980 uprising, protesting the  institution of martial law and the arrest of the country's leading dissident  leader, Kim Dae Jung. "For Koreans that incident was everything at the time,"  says Ahn.  </P> <P> When five years later Chun visited Washington, Korean TV beamed pictures of him  sharing cocktails with President Reagan. "I think Chun wanted to show the  people he was approved by the American government," Ahn says. "You can imagine  the kind of impact that had. Many Koreans began to believe Americans supported  Chun even in the Kwangju incident."  </P> <P> The presence of 43,000 American troops in South Korea perpetuates the negative  sentiment, he adds.  </P> <P> An avid fisherman, Ahn was minding his line on a lake bank one day when a  rowboat with two U.S. soldiers and two Korean prostitutes approached. After Ahn  waved them away from his fishing waters, the soldiers shouted profanities. "It  was a very small thing," he says. "But for Koreans, when we hear something like  that from a stranger it is a very, very strong insult. It really angers us.  </P> <P> "Americans are carefree . . . they forget. But Koreans don't. Orientals have  slower reactions, but our reactions are long and steady." Oddly, Ahn has never  discussed Vietnam with American veterans, but here too there were differences  as well as similarities in fighting the same war.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lessons From Japanese  </P> <P> Responding to an American characterization of Koreans as ruthless warriors, Ahn  explains that the kamikaze spirit was imbued in Korean military leaders during  Japan's 35 years of occupation. Also, during the Vietnam War, Korea was poor.  </P> <P> "Americans throw away helicopters and everything to save human lives. Koreans  die for rifles," he says. "We were so short of materials. That sort of  difference makes different soldiers."  </P> <P> There also were essentially different natures at play. During a mortar shelling  at an American military base, Ahn recalls, Americans hit the floor, while his  first reaction was to look out the window.  </P> <P> "I wanted to see what was going on," he says with a chuckle. "But for Americans  safety is first. They do everything by the rules."  </P> <P> Ahn stresses, however, that he is a non-political creature, so neutral that he  refuses to join even the Korean branch of the international literary  organization PEN. A former supporter of Kim, he now finds the dissident selfish  and uninterested in the good of the nation. His anti-American harangues are not  the view of the people, he says. Even the yearning for Korean reunification,  felt by both the old, who are parted from their families, and the young, who  have never known the Communist regime, seems to have skipped Ahn's generation,  now comfortable with the material and political gains they have made.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Greater Freedom  </P> <P> Censorship has been eased; government officials no longer visit newspapers as  they did in Chun's years, dictating headlines and leads; even Communist books  are now allowed publication.  </P> <P> Roh is popular, and, for Ahn, the past is largely for textbooks. Although  Koreans claim cultural, if not economic, superiority over the Japanese, with  the cultural circuit historically running from China to Korea to Japan, Ahn  views the powerful island nation as no more than a rival Asian neighbor. The  Japanese and Chinese organize more easily than the warily independent Koreans,  which partially explains their higher visibility even in foreign communities,  he thinks, but to his generation, they are no longer enemies.  </P> <P> At the same time, Ahn, like other Asians, has a more fatalistic attitude toward  life's possibilities, hammered out of a long national history. In 1919, 23,000  Koreans were killed and wounded by the Japanese in a pro-independence uprising  that is still seen as a significant incident for Asians.  </P> <P> Viewing the crushing of the Chinese student demonstrations, Ahn notes,  "Americans say, 'It's unbelievable, how can such a thing happen!' But we know  it can happen."  </P> <P> Liberalization in Korea may continue or it may not. "I believe it's going well,  but you can never tell the future in politics," Ahn says.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, he continues to write. Another book, "Silver Stallion," written in  college about a village's reaction following the rape of a woman by an American  soldier, will be published in the U.S. next January. And Ahn will soon start  work on a novel about life since the Kwangju massacre, which, he says, "even  now may be difficult to get published in Korea."  </P> <P> Otherwise, he describes his life as a placid, contented routine. He lives with  his mother in a house on the outskirts of Seoul, brags happily that his twin  daughters have been accepted into the city's top university, and, readers of  "White Badge" take note, is getting back together with his wife after a 14-year  separation.  </P> <P> "Orientals take everything so slowly," he says in the now-recognizable plaint,  and laughs, "It's the Korean way."  </P></p>

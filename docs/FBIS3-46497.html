National Assembly  Vice Chairman Phung Van Tuu directed the morning sitting, while  National Assembly Chairman Nong Duc Manh directed the afternoon  sitting.    The deputies continued to debate the Law on Business  Bankruptcy. Mai Thuc Lan, director of the National Assembly  Economy and Budget Committee, delivered a report on behalf of  the National Assembly Secretariat, the Law Review Committee, and  the Law Compiling Committee summarizing the views expressed by  deputies during the 29 December session and the planned  amendments to the draft Law on Business Bankruptcy. A total of  11 deputies expressed different views on the draft document,  including: Pham Phu from Ho Chi Minh City, Nguyen Duc Hoan from  Quang Tri, Tang Van Nghi and Nguyen Viet Dung from Ha Bac, Phung  Van Toan and Le Dinh Thanh from Vinh Phu, Pham Hung from Hai  Hung, Nguyen Duy Oanh from Lam Dong, Tran Quang Ngoc from Nam  Ha, Nguyen Van Tu from Dong Nai, and Ton That Bach from Hanoi.    The National Assembly Secretariat, the Law Review Committee,  and the Law Compiling Committee reviewed the draft Law on  Business Bankruptcy once more based on the deputies' views. Ly  Tai Luan, vice chairman of the National Assembly Economy and  Budget Committee and member of the National Assembly  Secretariat, read the text of this draft document. The deputies  adopted the Law on Business Bankruptcy by a vast majority of  votes. The promulgation of this law is of great importance and  significance because it protects the legitimate rights and  interests of creditors, debtors, and all parties concerned and  defines the responsibilities of debtors with regard to business  bankruptcies. This will contribute to guaranteeing effective  business operations and securing social order.

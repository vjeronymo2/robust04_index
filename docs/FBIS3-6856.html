Gen. Chawalit, a former Army commander-in-chief, made the  comment while talking with reporters about the conflict between  the military-dominated Senate, the House of Representatives and  the Government over the constitutional amendment issue.    "Civil servants (military) are valuable. They are  responsible  for the country.    "Whenever they feel the country is about to come crashing  down, they will be the first to act. We can't blame them," he  said.    Gen. Chawalit said it was good for senators from the  military  wing to band together and express their opposition to the  amendments.    They are helping to create unity in the thinking and  understanding of the Upper House.    The minister, asked if the move could lead to a coup, said:    "Some people still look at it that way because they still  have bad dreams."    He insisted there was no conflict hetween the two Houses  over  the amendment issue.    "They are just speaking differently," he sald.    Both MPs and senators are responsible and adult and know  what  they should do when the time comes, he said'    Gen. Chawalit said people were confused about the amendments  but this did not mean there would be any problems.    The political situation at the moment is "strange," he said,  because never before have senators united to oppose the  Government.    "This time some 200 of them are united. But that's not bad."    The Interior Minister said the situation in Parliament  contained an element of conflict and this made people feel  uncomfortable.</p>

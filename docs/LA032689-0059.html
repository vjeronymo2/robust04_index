			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOV. DEUKMEJIAN ON STATE BUDGET AND TIMES RESPONSE  </P> <P> Sorry, but if The Times devotes 10 or 20 times more column inches in its reply  to the governor's short letter, the editorial gee-whiz big-spender kids will be  unable to spook the Duke!  </P> <P> The people, the taxpayers, respect and support this governor. He could be  reelected by a great majority if he should change his mind and run again!  </P> <P> Just like the U.S. 200 years ago, California welcomes pilgrims with statewide  opportunities, but not with more and more welfare, government expansion and  higher taxes for our citizens.  </P> <P> And interesting -- evidently The Times does not want to accept the governor's  challenge to "put your money where your mouth is" and donate funds to the state  Treasury from its 1988 profit of $332 million. So I say, hurrah for the Duke!  </P> <P> RALPH S. LITTRELL  </P> <P> Cheviot Hills  </P></p>

			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / 2000 and beyond: Antony Thorncroft argues that the Millennium Commission needs to firm up its brief Members of the Millennium Commission, a handpicked band of nine of the extremely Good and reasonably Great, are travelling the UK for ideas on how to spend an estimated Pounds 1.6bn to celebrate the end of the second millennium. While they search for imaginative suggestions, they must also find a new chief executive. For when the Commission moved into new offices in Westminster's Little Smith Street last weekend, it was minus a boss. Mr Nicholas Hinton, former head of the Save the Children Fund, was due to start a Pounds 72,000-a-year job there yesterday. But last week, the Commission's chairman, Mr Stephen Dorrell, the National Heritage Secretary, told him his services would not be required. In his preliminary meetings with the commissioners, Mr Hinton had proved too interventionist. He thought he would have a decisive say in how the millions were spent: the commissioners are seeking a more subservient bureaucrat. Excited by the prospect of making their mark on the future, the commissioners are not about to delegate. However, they are saddled with implementing a scheme that has no organisation and is without a practical, considered, brief. The Millennium Fund, first mooted by Lord Palumbo, the former chairman of the Arts Council, is set to receive a fifth of the proceeds from the UK's National Lottery until the year 2001. But it is starting from scratch. Until this weekend, the fund consisted of a seconded civil servant, Ms Heather Wilkinson, a handful of helpers, and nine part-time commissioners, headed by Mr Dorrell and including industry secretary Michael Heseltine. Other commissioners were chosen for their strong regional links, or interest in areas likely to receive Millennium money. The Honourable Robin Dixon was ideal as an Olympic athlete from Northern Ireland; the Earl of Dalkeith can speak for Scotland and the heritage; and journalist Simon Jenkins is interested in architecture and has a Welsh background. But choosing the commissioners was the easy part. Deciding how the Millennium Fund should operate and what it should spend the money on is proving more difficult. The only guidelines were provided in a short speech by the former heritage secretary Peter Brooke. In it, he urged the commission to 'seek to capture the spirit of our age in enduring landmarks that symbolise our hopes for the future'. Millennium projects should be those that would probably not otherwise happen, he added. 'Above all, the Millennium Commission's legacy should form a permanent enhancement of our national heritage'. Not much detail there, although Mr Brooke had his own favourite ideas. He wanted a big Millennial Festival, and was keen on bursaries. On the projects, particularly the grand works that will absorb around half the fund's expenditure, the brief was wide open. If the commissioners want to, they can reject all the likely front runners. The new Tate Gallery of Modern Art on London's Bankside is a strong candidate - it represents contemporary art and it is international. But it is planning to move into a converted 1940s power station rather than a brand new 21st-century structure, hardly fitting for the new Millennium, the commissioners might decide. They can suggest to the proposed Cardiff Opera House that it goes to the Welsh Arts Council for its funding. They can point the revamped South Bank Centre towards the fifth of the lottery assigned to heritage projects. All can be criticised for not occupying new buildings, or for having possible alternative sources of lottery funding. This should add up to plenty of work for the nine part-timers. But the Commission will also be distributing thousands of small local grants, of Pounds 10,000 upwards. And the commissioners seem unwilling to hand over responsibility for these much smaller projects to a bureaucracy. This is perhaps understandable. The Millennium money comes from millions of ordinary citizens spread across the land, with the majority living far from a national opera house and art galleries. The government is keen that they should benefit. But how? The commissioners' tour for grass-roots projects has had little success to date. Most of the suggestions are outside the scope of the Fund - improving the health service, or education, or transport are already the responsibility of existing government institutions. Many are worthy but banal - like giving every village a millennial clock, or (the prime minister's suggestion) giving every community hall a computer. Few seem keen on a giant ferris wheel on the banks of the Thames. The Channel Tunnel has deterred plans for great engineering ventures. Environmental ideas - inner-city parklands and a new Caledonian Forest - look likely winners. The government proclaims it wants an independent body, but the commission is an obvious source for some 'feel good factor' in the run up to the next election. However, without guidelines and a bureaucracy that can take decisions, the Millennium Commission looks like becoming a huge bottleneck with plenty of money, but not enough time.</p>

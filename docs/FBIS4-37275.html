			<p>BFN     [Text] The 30th OAU summit took place in Tunisia a few days  ago. Algeria played a role in the treatment of two fundamental  issues during the summit: Arab-African cooperation, and the  Western Sahara issue. Foreign Minister Mohamed Salah Dembri  made the following statement to television on these two issues.    [Begin Dembri recording] Arab-African cooperation is an  issue  requiring mutual analysis. The ministerial committee has not  held a meeting about this for quite a few years. Algeria has  played an important role in reviving this committee, and we  asked for the next meeting to be held in Algeria as soon as  possible. Africa has indeed contributed to several Arab issues,  including the Palestinian issue. Today it seems to some  Africans that the Arabs have no intention of encouraging  Arab-African dialogue. That is why we are playing this leading  role to strongly adopt the idea a new African-Arab meeting.    Regarding the Western Sahara issue, the UN plan details a  number of conditions about the way the parties to the conflict,  Morocco and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Saquia El  Hamra and Rio de Oro [Polisario], should achieve rapprochement  and reach an agreement regarding the pending issues, including  determining the number of those entitled to vote, identifying  them, organizing the election campaign, etc. There is also the  issue of where the Moroccan administration and the Moroccan  troops should be based during the referendum? Then there is the  issue of the guarantees which should be provided after the  referendum. The UN plan does not treat or solve all these  points. In fact, the plan itself stipulates a direct dialogue  between the two parties and final talks on these points. So far  this has not taken place.    We have alerted the African countries -- and, thereby, world  public opinion -- to the need to treat these points before the  referendum. [end recording]</p>

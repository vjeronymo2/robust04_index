			<p>BFN     [Text] The Brazilian Public Opinion and Statistics  Institute, Ibope, has released its latest opinion poll on the  October election. This is how Brazilians would vote if the  presidential election were held today.    Ibope considered three possible candidates for the Brazilian  Democratic Movement Party, PMDB. Here are the figures:    If the election were held today, according to Ibope, Workers  Party candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva would be first with 34  percent of the votes; Senator Fernando Henrique Cardoso of the  Brazilian Social Democracy Party would be second with 17  percent; former Rio de Janeiro Governor Leonel Brizola of the  Democratic Labor Party would be third with 9 percent; former Sao  Paulo Governor Orestes Quercia -- if he were the PMDB candidate  -- would be fourth with 6 percent; Senator Espiridiao Amin of  the Progressive Renewal Party would be fifth with 3 percent; and  Liberal Party candidate Flavio Rocha would be sixth with 2  percent. The rate of undecided voters, blank and void ballots,  would total 29 percent.    Let us now see what would be the electoral outcome if the  PMDB candidate were Senator and former President Jose Sarney:    In this case, if the election were held today, Lula would be  first with 31 percent; Cardoso would be second with 16 percent;  Sarney would be third with 13 percent; Brizola would be fourth  with 8 percent; Amin would be fifth with 3 percent; and Rocha  would be sixth with 2 percent. The rate of undecided voters,  blank and void ballots would total 27 percent.    If the PMDB candidate were former Parana Governor Roberto  Requiao, the electoral outcome would be as follows:    Lula would remain in first place with 34 percent; Cardoso  would be second with 17 percent; Brizola would be third with 10  percent; Amin and Requiao would be joint fourth with 3 percent,  and Rocha would be at the bottom of the list with 2 percent.  The rate of undecided voters, blank and voided ballots would be  27 percent.    The Ibope survey also inquired how Brazilians would vote in  a  runoff election among the most voted candidates during the first  round. Four possible alternatives were considered. Here are  the results:    A runoff between Lula and Cardoso: Lula would obtain 44  percent and Cardoso 32 percent. The rate of undecided voters,  blank and voided ballots would total 24 percent.    A runoff between Lula and Sarney: Lula would obtain 44  percent and Sarney 31 percent. The rate of undecided voters,  blank and voided ballots would total 25 percent.    A runoff between Lula and Quercia: Lula would obtain 51  percent and Quercia would obtain 19 percent. The rate of  undecided voters, blank and voided ballots would total 30  percent.    A runoff between Lula and Requiao: Lula would obtain 52  percent and Requiao would obtain 17 percent. The rate of  undecided voters, blank and voided ballots would total 31  percent.    Ibope also asked voters who would be the best candidate for  the PMDB. Senator Sarney is first with 37 percent, Quercia is  second with 18 percent, and Requiao is third with 11 percent. A  total of 36 percent of those polled stated that they have no  preference among these candidates.    Ibope also asked voters for whom they would not vote under  any circumstance. Brizola appeared as the most rejected  candidate. Here are the figures:    According to Ibope, 49 percent of those polled said they  would never vote for Brizola; 34 percent said they would not  vote for Quercia; 31 percent would not vote for Lula or Rocha;  30 percent would not vote for Amin; 29 percent would not vote  for Sarney; 27 percent would not vote for Requiao; and 21  percent would not vote for Cardoso. Some 7 percent of those  polled said they have nothing against any of these candidates  while 9 percent declined to state their opinion.    Ibope polled 2,000 voters nationwide between 13 and 17  April.</p>

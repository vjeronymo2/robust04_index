			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Finance and the Family: Luring small investors back into shares - Philip Coggan reports on the birth of ProShare, which was formed to promote the benefits of buying UK equities FANCY a half-hour free consultation with a stockbroker? That is one of the perks being offered by a new body for private shareholders which was launched in the UK this week - the ProShare Association, which has been given financial backing by the Department of Trade and Industry, the Stock Exchange, and many leading companies. This might not be the best time to persuade investors about the merits of equity investing. Monday is the fifth anniversary of the stock market crash, which could have frightened many savers away from shares forever. The present economic news is hardly encouraging, either. Unemployment is rising rapidly and many of Britain's longest-standing companies are struggling to cope. But ProShare is relentlessly upbeat about long-term prospects. Its chairman, Sir Peter Thompson, even said at the launch that low inflation and falling interest rates would be bad news for fixed-interest securities - a view contrary to conventional investment thinking. The new organisation points to the fact that, over the long term, equities traditionally have outperformed other investments such as gilts or cash. The graphic shows just how dramatic the difference can be. Someone who invested Pounds 100 in shares in 1945 would, with gross income reinvested, have Pounds 28,513 by now; the same sum in gilts would have grown to just Pounds 1,209. Treasury bills were used as the best way to illustrate cash returns; it was only in the 1980s that competition in the building society market drove up savings rates to attractive levels. Even so, cash returns would have turned Pounds 100 into just Pounds 2,328. (The figures do not allow for dealing costs, but the disparity is too great for these to make much difference). Whether equities continue to do so well is a matter of considerable debate (see article below). And the sorry experience of investors during the past few years is that equity returns have been outstripped easily by the building societies. Still, any organisation which can be a mouthpiece for private investors as well as an information provider has to be welcome. The stock market is so dominated by institutional investors that the small investor must feel like Andorra trying to compete with the superpowers. The free stockbroking consultation might seem like a gimmick but it could at least prompt many people to investigate what often has seemed a stand-offish profession. About 60 brokers have agreed to take part in the scheme and a list of these will sent to those who agree to join the association, for which membership will cost Pounds 30 a year. In addition to meeting a broker, members will receive an investors' handbook, a monthly magazine, a portfolio record system, and vouchers for eight issues of the Weekend FT. Further perks will be added. There is a free two-month trial period. Those interested in receiving more information can call 071-971-0061. IF YOU DECIDE that the time is right for you to buy shares, how would you go about it and how much would you expect to pay? Much depends on how much money you have to invest and what kind of service you expect. There are three basic types of stockbroking service: Execution-only brokers, who will buy and sell shares on your instructions but who cannot give advice; Advisory brokers, who will transact deals and give opinions on the merits of shares; Discretionary brokers, who will take charge of your money and invest it on the basis of their opinions. These services are not available to everyone. If you want the service of a discretionary broker, you may need a substantial amount of money to invest, probably in excess of Pounds 50,000 or so. Execution-only brokers are far more accessible, but there are considerable risks involved. It is hard for experts to avoid being caught out by collapses at companies such as Polly Peck or Maxwell Communications, so the amateur investor is even more exposed when picking stocks. In addition, experts tend to agree that investors need a diversified portfolio of around a dozen shares to avoid the risk that one share might collapse. Given the costs of dealing in small sums, this probably means that a sensible portfolio requires a minimum of Pounds 25,000. The individual should first make sure that he or she has rainy day savings in the building society and other investments, such as a good pension scheme. Those with smaller sums do have ways of benefiting from the growth potential of shares - unit and investment trusts. Trusts hold a broad range of shares and thus give the small investor instant diversification. Management charges can be high but some managers have recently cut fees and offer attractive deals - such as a Gartmore fund which aims to track the FT-A All-Share Index and which has no initial charge. However, some investors may simply want to back their hunches and buy shares in a company they know well, such as Tesco. As well as the risks involved, they need to know about the charges. These mainly consist of: Commission This is charged by the stockbroker with whom you deal. Brokers normally have a set minimum commission; with bigger deals being charged in proportion to the size of the transaction, say 1.5 to 2 per cent. The cheapest rates tend to be found at execution-only brokers. Manchester-based Gall and Eke, for example, have a minimum of only Pounds 10 for deals of under Pounds 1,000; Sharelink is currently charging just Pounds 50 for deals of over Pounds 8,000. Brokers who offer advice and portfolio management will normally charge higher commissions, but claim this reflects a better standard of service. Buy-sell spread Those who trade in shares set two prices; they will buy the shares at the lower price and sell at the higher. For example, shares in Marks &amp; Spencer were available on a spread of 325p to 327p before trading started yesterday morning. Newspaper listings, such as the Financial Times, quote the mid-price of 326p, but if you had wanted to buy shares you would have paid at least 327p. Investors must make up this spread before they can make a profit. The spread on Marks &amp; Spencer is fairly narrow; but it can be far larger on small company shares. Take Acsis, a wonder stock in early 1987; the spread yesterday morning was 0.5p to 1p. So an investor who bought the shares and immediately sold them would face an instant loss of 50 per cent on his or her investment. Stamp duty This is charged by the government at a rate of 0.5 per cent of a transaction's value. You only pay the duty when you buy shares, not when you sell them. The duty is due to be abolished when the Stock Exchange introduces a new electronic system of share dealing called TAURUS.</p>

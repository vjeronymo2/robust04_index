			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Books: The human meteorite who fell without trace - Poetry COLLECTED POEMS by Weldon Kees Faber Pounds 7.99, 180 pages COLLECTED EARLY POEMS 1950-70 by Adrienne Rich Norton Pounds, 435 pages WHAT more satisfying a name for an enigma than Weldon Kees, the American poet whose car was found abandoned near San Francisco's Golden Gate bridge in 1955? Was it suicide or a feint? No trace of his body was found, no satisfactory explanation offered. A recent Bookmark programme set itself the thankless task of discovering the truth about Kees. It tracked him through the America of his lifetime - from his mid-west, pre-Depression childhood in Beatrice, Nebraska, through his years in New York City in the 1940s (where he made documentary films; worked briefly as art critic of the Nation; wrote for Time and Paramount Newsreel; painted canvases that allied him with the early abstract expressionists; and wrote Brechtian songs for vaudeville) and back to San Francisco where he took up classical jazz piano and collaborated on a book about non-verbal communication, illustrated with his own photographs. All this apart, there was the writing: short stories (still uncollected), a novel (published in the US two years ago), and the poems now available in Britain for the first time. What sort of a man was he? A meteorite, by all accounts; a man of intense, feverish activity. A chain-smoking poser; a country boy turned city slicker (if the photographs are to be believed). 'He lived in a permanent and hopeless apocalypse,' said Kenneth Rexroth, godfather of the Beats, who knew him towards the end of his life. (That apocalypse was, of course, sustained by drugs and alcohol). He was a man of narrow and profound vision whose poetry, prosaic in style, displays a kind of benumbed bitterness; a strange, obsessive, riddling analysis of the heart's paralysis. From time to time, it has the desolation of an Edward Lear: 'A white-faced man with sad, enormous eyes.' The light in the poems usually is bleached, wan, colourless. Nothing is healed, nothing shriven. Kees returns empty-handed from the search for life's meaning. Although he lived 1,000 miles or more from the respectability of his family, Kees, an only child, used to send home newspaper cuttings on his 'successes' as a poet, film-maker, etc. Did his mother understand? When, two days after his disappearance, the dusty, fusty couple appeared in San Francisco and were taken to the bridge, his mother looked down at the water, disbelievingly, and said: 'But he was never the athletic type.' Kees published only three small volumes of poetry over 11 years and was never regarded as a major figure during his lifetime. Adrienne Rich, on the other hand, in a career as poet and libertarian activist that spans nearly half a century, has become both a popular and a recognisably angry public voice. And yet, it was not always so - as her Collected Early Poems 1950-1970 demonstrates. In her first collection of 1951,for example, which is full of the enormous assurance of youth, she regards everything with a calm, aestheticising eye. There is an attitude of wise resignation before the things of the world. By the late 1960s, having passed through the political turbulence of that decade, there is no such thing as inner and outer any more - everything is political. The old language is the language of the oppressor and it must be wrested from his grasp.</p>

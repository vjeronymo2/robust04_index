Medium- and large-sized enterprises remain the pillar of  China's steel and iron industry in China with 80 percent of the  newly increased steel and steel material production turned out  by these enterprises.    Key items and those of higher technology involved in the  metallurgical industry made progress. The fixed assets  investment in the steel industry for the whole year is expected  to be RMB [renminbi] 25.7 billion while the newly increased  capacity of iron-smelting was put at 10 million tonnes and  steel-smelting capacity at 7 million tonnes. Fixed assets  investment in the gold industry was valued at RMB 1.14 billion.    The steel industry showed an obvious gain in its economic  results mainly because of a sharp rise in production volume,  adjustment of structure and the price factor. The year-round  profit tax turned out was valued at RMB 56 billion, 95 percent  up over the previous year while the profits earned were put at  RMB 28.5 billion last year, a gain of 177 percent over the  previous year.</p>

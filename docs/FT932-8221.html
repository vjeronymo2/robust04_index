			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / E Germans begin return to work STRIKING east German metal and electrical workers began returning to work yesterday after accepting last Friday's so-called Saxony compromise postponing by two years equalisation of wages in the two parts of the country. However, IG Metall, the powerful engineering union, is insisting the strikes will continue unless wages for the steel sector match those in the metal and electrical industries. Union officials in Berlin-Brandenburg, where most of the steel sector is located, said the agreement widens the income differentials between steel and metal workers. Over 7,000 steel workers have been on strike for the past 16 days.</p>

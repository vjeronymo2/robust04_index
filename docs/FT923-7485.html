			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: UK housing The news from the UK housing market is undeniably bleak, and will probably get worse. But it would be rash for investors to conclude that a consumer-led recovery can only happen when residential property prices pick up again. The fact that 1m home owners are trapped in their houses with negative equity is indeed cause for concern - but then the latest official figures are considerably lower than some of the wilder estimates which depressed sentiment in recent weeks. Financial journalists and stockbroking analysts - many of whom followed their own advice to take out big mortgages at the top of the market - do not tend to highlight the 9m householders with their heads above water. The fear of unemployment may be as big an influence on their behaviour as the prospect of a further shake-out in the property market. It is worth remembering that consumers started spending at the end of the last recession when house prices were falling in real terms.</p>

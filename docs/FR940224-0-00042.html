			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> In international negotiations with our partner in the supercomputer regime, we have reached agreement on a new supercomputer threshold level. Accordingly, this rule revises the definition of ``supercomputer'' in &sect;770.2 and &sect;776.11(a) to increase the supercomputer threshold level from a CTP (composite theoretical performance) equal to or exceeding 195 Mtops (million theoretical operations per second) to a CTP equal to or exceeding 1,500 Mtops. The United States continues to seek an agreement that would increase the supercomputer threshold level to 2,000 Mtops. Following the completion of negotiations with our supercomputer partner, the Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) intends to publish a rule that will revise the supercomputer safeguards that apply to certain countries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule also increases the General License GFW eligibility level for digital computers controlled by ECCN 4A03A from a CTP less than 195 Mtops to a CTP of 500 Mtops or less for eligible countries listed in Supplement No. 4 to part 778 and a CTP of 1,000 Mtops or less for other eligible countries. Subject to the restrictions in &sect;771.2(c), items eligible for General License GFW may be exported to most destinations in Country Groups T and V. General License GFW is not available for exports to Iran, Syria, the People's Republic of China, or the South African military or police and a validated license continues to be required for exports of all computers controlled by ECCN 4A03A to these destinations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To conform with recent COCOM changes to the International Industrial List (IL), this rule amends the Validated License Required paragraph in ECCN 4A03A to indicate that General License G&hyph;DEST is available for exports of ``digital'' computers with a ``CTP'' not exceeding 260 Mtops, except to Country Groups S and Z, Iran, Syria, and South African military and police entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> National security-based validated license requirements continue to apply to: (1) Exports of ``digital computers'' with a CTP exceeding 260 Mtops to controlled destinations and to all other destinations not eligible for General License GFW and (2) exports to GFW-eligible destinations of ``digital computers'' that exceed the GFW eligibility levels (i.e., 500 Mtops or less for eligible Supplement No. 4 countries and 1,000 Mtops or less for other eligible countries).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Foreign policy-based validated license requirements remain in effect for exports of computers controlled by ECCNs 4A03A and 4A94F (i.e., computers with a CTP of 6 Mtops or greater) to Iran or Syria and for exports of all computers to Country Groups S and Z, and South African military and police entities. Exporters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should also be aware that the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control maintains an embargo on other destinations, such as Iraq and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule also amends ECCNs 4A01A, 4A02A, and 4A03A to increase the level at which nuclear nonproliferation controls apply to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> computers. Nuclear nonproliferation controls now apply only for exports of computers with a CTP exceeding 500 Mtops to countries  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> listed in Supplement No. 4 to part 778. Previously, nuclear nonproliferation controls applied to computers with a CTP of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 195 Mtops or above for countries listed in Supplement No. 4 to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part 778.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule makes more computers eligible for export under the special license procedures. Destinations that are not subject to nuclear nonproliferation controls, and not eligible to receive supercomputers under the special license procedures, are eligible to receive computers below the new supercomputer threshold level, i.e., 1,500 Mtops. Countries for which exports of computers with a CTP above 500 Mtops are subject to nuclear nonproliferation controls are now eligible to receive computers with a CTP of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 500 Mtops or less.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Foremen at Ford strike over job cuts FOREMEN at Ford plants in Southampton and at Dagenham, east London, went on strike yesterday in protest at the company's threat of compulsory redundancies. White-collar unions at Ford are due to meet the management next Tuesday to discuss the situation following a ballot vote in support of industrial action by the company's staff. But a union official said yesterday that his members were 'chomping at the bit' to strike over the compulsory redundancy issue. Last week Ford backed down and agreed not to press ahead with any compulsory redundancies among its blue-collar labour force as a result of improved demand and adjustments to production targets. But to the anger of staff, the company has so far refused to withdraw the threat of compulsory redundancies for its white-collar employees. Management pointed out yesterday it had announced last December that it wanted 2,200 staff jobs to go by the end of this month and it is now only 157 short of that figure. The company said it hoped to achieve the cut in white-collar staff it required without any need for compulsory redundancies.</p>

			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HEALTH;  </P> <P> SHADOW OF A DOUBT;  </P> <P> A SCIENTIST'S PAINFUL LESSON IN THE HUMAN DYNAMICS OF PRENATAL TESTING  </P> <P> Until January of last year, Susan Hodge, a biomathemetician and geneticist at  the UCLA School of Medicine, had been accustomed to teaching prospective  doctors the fine points of prenatal genetic testing, she recalls, in  academically detached fashion.  </P> <P> That was before she attempted, at age 40, what was to be her third pregnancy.  </P> <P> She and her geneticist husband, David Greenberg, already had two lively  daughters -- 7 and 10. Both had been healthy babies but it required no academic  expertise for Hodge and Greenberg to realize this pregnancy was different.  </P> <P> Hodge's age put her in the high-risk category for genetic defects. Prenatal  evaluation -- the couple chose amniocentesis, performed in Hodge's 17th week --  was, as they perceived things, essential.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lesson in Human Dynamics  </P> <P> But in the weeks between the time she first realized she was pregnant and when  the test results were delivered, Hodge says today, she was to learn a great  deal about the human dynamics of genetic testing. None of what she was to find  out, she says, is included in the medical educations of most doctors.  </P> <P> As she recalled recently, Hodge kept silent about her pregnancy except in the  presence of her closest friends and family members. "I had just noticed that  other friends or colleagues, when they (were going to) have amnio, didn't  announce their (pregnancies) until the day or week they got the result."  </P> <P> Eventually, when Hodge reflected on her behavior to draft a letter -- largely  written when she was still pregnant -- to the New England Journal of Medicine,  she concluded: "The other, more disturbing phenomenon is how waiting has  affected my attitude toward the pregnancy.  </P> <P> "At many levels, I deny that I really am pregnant 'until after we get the  results.' I ignore the flutterings and kicks I feel; I talk of if, rather than  when the baby comes."  </P> <P> And once the amniocentesis was performed, Hodge said, she found the two weeks  of waiting for the test results a time of uncontrollable, consuming anxiety and  fear.  </P> <P> "I (did not anticipate being nearly as anxiety-ridden) as I was. I think it was  dealing with (the testing process) as a reality rather than (an abstract  academic concept.)"  </P> <P> She lay awake at night, afraid of what would happen if the test results  indicated the fetus she was carrying had a serious defect.  </P> <P> "I guess it was just the fear of getting a bad outcome and facing the  termination of the pregnancy -- a pregnancy that I wanted," she said in a  quiet, restrained voice over the telephone from New York City, where she and  Greenberg relocated to new medical school teaching jobs a few months ago.  </P> <P> Although Hodge kept the severity of her emotions at least somewhat to herself,  "I was losing sleep. I was somewhat distracted." When she did sleep, she wrote  in her medical journal  </P> <P> letter, her dreams were preoccupied by the need for a second trimester  abortion.  </P> <P> Greenberg was aware of his wife's anxiety ("She . . . wasn't getting enough  sleep and was clearly anxious.") but said he did not share it.  </P> <P> In fact, he says today, the possibility the pregnancy could go awry "did not  enter my consciousness."  </P> <P> "I knew intellectually what the chances were, but I did not accept emotionally  that it could happen."  </P> <P> As it would turn out, the odds went against the couple. The amniocentesis  results were among what they considered the worst imaginable. Susan Hodge's  baby was affected by Down's syndrome.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Typical of a Number of Women  </P> <P> According to genetics experts and counselors questioned by The Times --  including the counselor whose duties included delivering the bad news to Susan  Hodge -- Hodge is typical of a growing number of women choosing pregnancy in  their late 30s or 40s. For such women, Hodge and genetics experts say, the  perceived need for genetic testing comes to control the entire pregnancy  experience.  </P> <P> Among the observations:  </P> <P> * The one-, two- or three-week wait for results of amniocentesis or even the  two-day to one-week wait for results of chorionic villus sampling, a newer and  slightly different test, can often become a period of intense anxiety.  </P> <P> * Because of pervasive fear that test results will be unfavorable, many women  -- just as Hodge did -- deliberately restrict the number of people who know of  their pregnancies to their closest family members and friends. Somehow, they  reason, if the pregnancy then must be terminated, they will not have to endure  the emotionally draining experience of explaining the situation to an endless  variety of acquaintances. In a sense, the pregnancy has less reality if fewer  people know.  </P> <P> * Until favorable prenatal test results are available that have the effect of  validating the pregnancy, many women and their spouses refrain from such  behavior as buying maternity clothing or baby goods and avoid talk that focuses  on the fetus' behavior.  </P> <P> When she finally decided to go public with her experience -- by writing the  letter, which was published last month -- Hodge conceded that she had  effectively suppressed most behavior commonly lumped under the heading of  </P> <P> bonding. But the experience, she and Greenberg say now, became a valuable  lesson that such denial is actually shortsighted and counterproductive. They  may make it more -- rather than less -- difficult to cope with a calamitous  genetic testing result, if it comes.  </P> <P> Chances of a bad result are low. According to Dr. Connie Sandlin, medical  director of the genetics center at Memorial Medical Center of Long Beach,  amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling (commonly known as CVS), return  favorable findings 95% to 99% of the time.  </P> <P> "I am lucky," said Ann Garber, a genetics testing expert at Cedars-Sinai  Medical Center, "that 95% of the time in my job, I'm able to give couples  information that thrills and delights them."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tension Unavoidable  </P> <P> But for women waiting for their amniocentesis or CVS results, the reality of  such odds often means very little, Hodge, Greenberg and genetics experts  agreed. The tension is unavoidable.  </P> <P> "I was in my office talking to a student when the phone rang," Hodge recalled.  "It was the genetics counselor.  </P> <P> "I said, 'Hold on just a minute,' and asked the student to leave. And I thought  to myself, 'Good, the waiting is over.' The next words out of his mouth were,  'I'm sorry, I have bad news.'  </P> <P> "I was simply stunned. I started to ask him (something else) and then I  realized I wasn't hearing what he was saying."  </P> <P> With a few more formalities, Hodge hung up and dialed her husband. Greenberg  was writing a difficult research study report and, when the phone rang and he  heard his wife's voice, he thought she was calling with advice on the wording  of an especially difficult passage.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Our Baby Is Down's'  </P> <P> "I picked up the phone and (all) she said (was), 'It's Down's,' " Greenberg  recalled. "She said it in a way that made it sound like the answer to a  question. I said, 'What?' And she said, 'Our baby is Down's,' and I didn't say  anything for a long time as I tried to absorb this. (At some point), I said,  'Oh.' "  </P> <P> Within a few days, the couple arranged for a second-trimester abortion -- the  solution chosen, genetics counselors said, by 90% or more of those in that  situation.  </P> <P> Because CVS can be performed earlier in a pregnancy than amniocentesis,  abortions it precedes usually occur in the first trimester. First-trimester  abortions are clinically safer and easier to perform than those in the second  trimester, and they tend to entail less psychological trauma, genetics  counselors agree.  </P> <P> As their lives regained order, Hodge and Greenberg came to realize that the  denials and emotional tricks they employed to deny the reality of the pregnancy  until the amniocentesis validated it had been mistaken. And in this reaction  the couple have a valuable lesson for others, said Stephen Keiles, the Kaiser  Foundation Hospital genetics counselor to whom the responsibility to notify  Hodge fell.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Avoid Dealing With It  </P> <P> "In my experience, the majority of women voice some concerns regarding the  results (of genetic testing), and I've noticed that a lot of people will not  want to address certain questions until the results come back," Keiles said.  "They (couples) say, 'We'll deal with that if we have to.' "  </P> <P> But at the same time, Keiles said, many such couples behave in the fashion of  Hodge and Greenberg. "One of the most common things I've noticed is people not  telling others that they are pregnant. I think that is a common theme.  </P> <P> "I don't advise them who they should tell and who they shouldn't, but I . . .  try to point out that, if the results do indicate a problem, denying the fact  that there was a pregnancy is not going to make it any easier to deal with. I  say, 'No matter what you think now, if the results show there is a problem, you  will be just as upset if you don't tell people as if you do.' "  </P> <P> This is advice that Hodge and Greenberg suggest couples should listen to. All  of it, she said, has changed her thinking fundamentally.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Enjoy the Pregnancy'  </P> <P> "I would suggest to women who are having prenatal diagnosis that they not try  to keep the pregnancy a secret," she said, "any longer than they would if they  were not having prenatal diagnosis.  </P> <P> "Internally, I would suggest that they try to go ahead and enjoy the pregnancy,  accept it, get excited about it, buy maternity clothes and all the things that  one does. We thought (that by handling it as we did), we would save ourselves  pain if we did get a bad outcome. But I felt we had not saved ourselves any  pain and all we had done was deprived ourselves of the joy."  </P> <P> Greenberg's feelings are identical. "I think it was a mistake for us not to  admit the pregnancy, not to accept it between ourselves and to keep it  tentative, as though one could put off the emotional attachment until one was  certain," he said. "That was just wrong."  </P> <P> Not everyone agrees. Maritchou Jannsen, who heads a group called Support for  Prenatal Decisions, based in San Bernardino, asserted that it is not possible  to establish hard and fast rules.  </P> <P> "I think Sue (Hodge) was trying to speak philosophically when she says that,  another time, they would go right ahead and tell everyone," Jannsen said. "Not  everybody can deal with outsiders' reactions quite as easily."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Experience Is Common  </P> <P> Long Beach Memorial's Sandlin said the experience of Hodge and Greenberg is  common. "I think women often aren't even aware that they are reacting in this  fashion," Sandlin said. And she said that, in the average busy obstetrician's  office, such subtleties may be easily overlooked by a physician intent on  monitoring and maintaining the strictly physical health of his patient.  </P> <P> Research studies have shown that both amniocentesis and CVS produce anxiety  reactions in women undergoing the procedures. But, since the waiting time for  CVS is shorter and it can be done earlier, the studies found the anxiety for  CVS to be less than for amniocentesis. But both studies also noted that CVS  carries a higher risk of spontaneous abortion. And in some patients, other  experts said, CVS results may not be as reliable as those from amniocentesis.  </P> <P> Cedars-Sinai's Garber said that, strictly on the narrow issue of emotional  effects, she prefers CVS, especially since its timing permits the abortion  decision to be made before a woman's pregnancy starts to become noticeable to  others.  </P> <P> "The matter can be kept more private," she said. "If you elect to terminate, it  is not as obvious to your friends and colleagues."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Choices Are Complex  </P> <P> But Garber and other experts agreed that the choice between CVS and  amniocentesis is a complex one, based on many factors that can sometimes  conflict. Generally, these experts agreed, neither procedure can be called  better than the other.  </P> <P> For Susan Hodge, it took two months to overcome the emotional impact brought  about by the outcome of her pregnancy and what she now recognizes as her own  incorrect decisions during its course.  </P> <P> She realized the emotional ordeal was over at a certain, quite specific moment.  "I was able to laugh very hard at something my daughter said," she recalled,  "and then I started crying."  </P></p>

			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Kleinwort hopes stamina will bring big dividends: One of the bidders The investment management division of Kleinwort Benson, the London-based investment bank, will be one of the foreign institutions bidding for a mandate to manage one of the new funds. For Mr David Glasgow, the director who heads the bank's Polish operations, the bid represents the culmination of a commitment to the mass privatisation scheme which began in October 1990 and to which the bank has stayed faithful despite many setbacks and delays. 'We looked at the scheme and we liked it. It is clever, low risk and structured in a way which made it possible to sell to our board. It also fits into our global interest in joint venture deals in emerging markets,' he says. Part of the determination to stay the course stems from Kleinwort's conviction that it has found the ideal partner in the Polish Development Bank, a young private sector bank voted the country's best earlier this year by Gazeta Handlowy economic newspaper. Having chosen a partner the Kleinwort team then spent much of last year 'kicking the tyres' of 17 of the 180 companies then on offer for management by the putative funds. 'We were encouraged because we found that although most of them were in a 'cash-gridlock' they were surviving, even though in some cases that meant just paying their staff and saying 'no' to the government's tax demands. What surprised us most favourably was the quality of management and the level of skills,' Mr Glasgow adds. Kleinwort is one of at least eight UK-based groups who were initially interested in taking a 10-year management role, even though the pay-off in regard to the capital gains on their end-of-term equity share-out remain difficult to quantify with any precision. Mr Glasgow believes that only five UK groups have stayed the course, along with Italian, Swiss, French, a few German and several US institutions. The fund managers eventually chosen by the Polish authorities will not be able to cherry-pick the companies of their choice. They will end up with a mixed bag after an elaborate numbers game designed to ensure that all funds are a mixture of almost sure-fire winners and assorted 'dogs'. The funds will put in management resources, 'but you don't have to invest millions to get a pay-off', according to Mr Glasgow who has set up a management team staffed largely by bilingual Anglo-Poles. Having been in on the scheme from the start, Kleinwort and other potential foreign participants were able to get several modifications to the original plan accepted by the Polish side. Most important was the change to closed-end rather than open funds, so enhancing the possibility of substantial capital gains for those who most successfully manage the assets shortly to come under their control.</p>

			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1993 (17): Complex contract was worth Pounds 15m - Large-Scale Application: East Anglian health authority - Continuing reforms within the health service will bring a shake-up in health IT, and fresh opportunities for private sector operators EAST ANGLIA, like other regions, ran a central mainframe computer service for its eight districts. But in 1989 the government announced its Working for Patients initiative, which handed much more autonomy not only to districts but also individual hospitals, which could become largely independent trusts. 'We consulted the staff very closely and there was general agreement that they were having trouble providing a viable service,' says Keith Heron, general manager at Huntingdon district and also chairman of the regional computing committee. 'NHS salaries are not great and people were at the top of the scales. Our location in Cambridge meant we were training people who were then filched by local companies and the Science Park. We were not able to retain the best people and had trouble recruiting good staff, so we had quite a few vacancies. 'The staff and the users were gradually all coming to the view that we had to look at the private sector.' Staff were also consulted during the evaluation of suppliers. The short-list was three of the top six suppliers: Hoskyns, Sema and Data Sciences. These companies spoke to the regional committee at meetings which also included staff representatives. There were then meetings between the companies and the staff representatives alone. 'Both staff and management felt most confident about Sema's attitude towards employing our staff, transferring their terms and conditions, training and career development,' Heron says. 'There was a guarantee of no redundancies for three years: that was one reason for going to Sema and some of our staff have done exceptionally well there, gaining promotion and better training and career paths by working for a big computing company. This also meant we would continue to be supported by people who had NHS knowledge in general and experience of our systems in particular. 'In addition, although we would have contractual commitment from the directors, just as important was their personal attitude. Sema was not the cheapest, although close to it, so our selection was clearly not based solely on cost.' Sema was awarded a complex contract which nominally ran for five years and was worth Pounds 15m. The company took on 100 region computing staff: most have moved to a Cambridge site now set up by Sema. It also took over an ICL mainframe computer and two big DEC Vax minicomputer configurations. Applications on these and local machines range from payroll to patient administration. 'In a sense we have not saved any money,' Heron says. 'The proposal was that the supplier would take over everything - in effect the existing budget - and we would also pay a management fee. However, we had some unfilled vacancies, so that was reflected in the budget. 'Sema took over our equipment, which is leased, but charge it back to us at 19 per cent. With interest rates much lower now, we are looking at buying out the lease. 'The main benefit was that we got a viable service, both for maintaining the existing systems and for future development.' The contract guaranteed Sema Pounds 9m for running the existing service over the first three years of the new health service structure. During that time the districts and the 30 hospitals and other trusts would work on their future computing needs and could install their own systems. After three years they could break with the central service, taking their service funds with them. The remaining Pounds 6m was not guaranteed, although it includes a system development element arranged in a way which encourages districts financially to go to Sema. As Heron puts it: 'Sema took quite a risk on operational services but less risk on development services.' Even so, he points out that the health service reforms mean that instead of dealing with just eight districts, Sema also now has to negotiate with the 30 trusts. Sema's marketing director, Paul Hopkins, says some trusts are moving some systems from the old mainframe to program packages running on smaller local machines. But he thinks Sema is in a strong position to retain much of the business beyond the end of the contract. 'We're now working on convincing trusts that they should concentrate on delivering health care and leave us to concentrate on delivering information technology,' he says. SUPPLIER PROFILE Sema Group PLC was created in 1988 from the merger of the long-established UK computing services company, CAP, and French company Sema-Metra. The group has 3,500 staff, including 1,000 in the facilities management division. It has been in facilities management for 20 years Offices: Sema has three IBM and four ICL computer centres, including those in Glasgow, Birmingham and across central and southern England. Turnover and profit: 1991 turnover Pounds 412.5m (including Pounds 43m from a subsidiary which was sold); pre-tax profit Pounds 14.2m. 1992 Pounds 416.7m; pre-tax profit Pounds 19.5m. Facilities management is 14 per cent of turnover. Market research says the company is third or fourth in the UK facilities management business. Price: Contracts typically last three or five years. Annual contract costs range from Pounds 500,000 to Pounds 10m. Clients: 40-50.</p>

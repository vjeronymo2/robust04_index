			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From Robbie Barnett in Lhasa] </F>   [Text] Chinese police are alleged to have beaten  demonstrators and arrested five Tibetans when shopkeepers staged  a protest in Lhasa, according to sources in the city. Up to 200  Tibetans joined a crowd in the Tibetan capital on Friday [27  May] protesting against tax increases. The demonstrators were  rallying against recent increases of more than 20 per cent in  taxes on shopkeepers.    But the incident, which fell close to two sensitive  anniversaries, could have a concealed political agenda. Last  Monday marked the 33rd anniversary of the Tibetans' formal  surrender to the Chinese in the "17 Point Agreement" of 1951,  and Tuesday was the anniversary of a major protest in 1993 which  began as a complaint about prices but turned into a  pro-independence rally.    Friday's protest began around 2 pm when traders in the  Barkor, the main shopping street in the Tibetan quarter of the  city, closed their shops, apparently in protest at the tax  increase. Between 100 and 200 people gathered in front of the  offices of the Lhasa "Chengguanqu", the inner city government,  in Dekyi Shar Lam (Beijing Dong Lu), and shouted slogans against  taxation. The protesters were joined by about 100 onlookers who  also began shouting, one report said.    At about 5 pm riot police carrying shields marked "gong an"  (police) took up positions along Dekyi Lam and sealed off the  area around the inner city government offices. A number of  demonstrators were beaten and five people were believed to have  been arrested, according to an unconfirmed report. A platoon of  armed police was moved by truck into the area at around 7.30 pm,  by which time the crowd had dispersed. Police confiscated the  passports of three tourists staying at the Banakshol Hotel,  opposite the government offices, who had witnessed the protest.  Watching disturbances is illegal for foreigners in Tibet,  according to local laws.    This is the second incident to have been reported in Lhasa  in  the past week. Last Tuesday, four monks were said to have been  arrested after they began a pro-independence protest near the  Jokhang Temple in the Barkor area, according to a report  yesterday by the KYODO News Agency in Tokyo, citing unnamed  foreign tourists. The four monks were detained by police after  shouting pro-independence slogans, and some of the monks were  knocked to the ground by the police before being led away.    Meanwhile in neighbouring Nepal, fears that Tibetans might  demonstrate to mark the anniversary of the "17 Point Agreement"  led to a wave of random arrests of Tibetans in Kathmandu. In a  well co-ordinated security operation, an estimated 70 Tibetans  were imprisoned for eight hours in police quarters in the  Nepalese capital, according to one detainee. "We were held from  10 in the morning until six o'clock that evening. We had no  food or water and were escorted by police even to go to the  toilet," said the detainee, who had been picked up by police for  no apparent reason while he was on his way to collect a visa  from the Chinese' Embassy in Kathmandu.</p>

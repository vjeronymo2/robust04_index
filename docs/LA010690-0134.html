			<p><P> January 6, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> BOMB THREATS SENT TO GOVERNMENT UNITS  </P> <P> The FBI is investigating what agents described as "a plurality of bomb threats"  that have been mailed from Santa Ana to more than a dozen state and federal  government agencies across the country.  </P> <P> FBI spokesman Fred Reagan said the bureau could not release specific details of  the investigation beyond disclosing that it was centered in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> But he acknowledged that between 12 and 20 government agencies have received  the bomb threats.  </P> <P> Chuck Moyer, an administrator at the Nevada state division of unclaimed  property, said he received a copy of the bomb threat when he opened his morning  mail Thursday. The letter contained the message, "Consider this as a bomb  threat."  </P> <P> Moyer said that the letter was unsigned and that it was mailed from Santa Ana  on Dec. 29. "It was handwritten on plain white paper," he said. "It's a mystery  why someone has a grudge against the unclaimed property division."  </P> <P> Moyer said Nevada officials are taking the threat seriously. He said that an  emergency response plan has been revised and that the division's employees were  setting aside suspicious-looking packages that arrive in the mail.  </P> <P> Officials were unavailable for comment on how California agencies were  reacting.  </P> <P> Moyer said checks by the Nevada agency revealed that divisions of unclaimed  property in other states had received the same threat.

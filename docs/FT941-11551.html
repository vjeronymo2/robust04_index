			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Government Bonds: US long-dated buoyed by Treasury refunding package US government bonds were firmer yesterday, after Tuesday's sell-off, with prices on the long end of the yield curve posting moderate gains following a Treasury announcement on new supply. Late in the day, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  1/2 better at 99 19/32 , with the yield slipping to 6.275 per cent. On the short end, the two-year note was unchanged at 99 5/8 , to yield 4.181 per cent. The day's economic data had little impact. The Commerce Department said its composite index of leading indicators rose 0.7 per cent in December, as forecast, while sales of new homes surged to their highest level in five years. However, most analysts dismissed the reports as old news. After shedding about a point in the previous session, long-dated securities opened higher on overseas buying, but slipped back when traders failed to follow through on the early activity. However, trading picked up soon after the Treasury revealed the details of its quarterly refunding package, to be offered next week. The long bond posted solid gains when the announcement of a Dollars 40bn sale of new securities produced no surprises. Traders then turned their attention to tomorrow's employment data, which would provide evidence on whether the economy has slowed significantly in the first quarter. Gilt prices ended little changed, in spite of a Treasury report suggesting continued recovery, which further weakened the likelihood of another interest rate cut in the near future, dealers said. The focus is shifting to next week's January retail prices data. The data is expected to show that inflation is well under control and could help revive interest in the market. 'I don't think we need a rate cut to get the market to move,' said Mr Mark Reckless, UK economist at S. G. Warburg. 'A good retail price index number will focus international attention' on the market, he added. No details had emerged by the end of the day of the meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England. March Gilt futures on Liffe ended down  1/16 point at 118 1/2 . Japanese government bond prices slid in European trading, as the market received confirmation of some aspects of the new fiscal package, which is to be unveiled today. 'The key issue is how it will all be financed,' said Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International. The expectation is that the bulk of the package will be financed by raising debt. This was reinforced yesterday by the news that the new welfare tax, replacing consumption tax, is only coming into force in 1997. Concerns about bond market supply dampened the reception of yesterday's Y100bn two-year auction. The market is likely to remain wary ahead of next week's Y700bn four-year auction. 'I think a lot of the supply worries have already been taken on board, but we are in the run up to the end of the fiscal year,' said Mr Lyons. However, he added that the current weakness appeared to be a temporary problem. German government bonds eased in quiet trading yesterday ahead of the Bundesbank's fortnightly council meeting today. Traders said the market was evenly split on the prospects of the central bank cutting interest rates after the meeting. However, they added that the release of better-than-expected industrial production data for December might persuade the Bundesbank to delay a cut in rates until its next meeting. The March bund future on Liffe traded at 100.35 in the late afternoon, down 0.06 on the day and down from an intraday high of 100.48. The yield on 10-year French government bonds slipped back above the yield on bunds yesterday due to fears that the Bank of France might cut interest rates independently of the Bundesbank. After breaking below the yield on bunds last week, the yield on 10-year OATs had widened to three basis points above bunds by yesterday afternoon. Mr Adam Chester, international bond strategist at Yamaichi International in London, said although the French economy would benefit from a cut in interest rates, it would lead to a weakening in the French franc. 'This would have a knock-on effect on OATs,' he said. The notional March bond future traded at 130.28 in the late afternoon, down 0.10 on the day.</p>

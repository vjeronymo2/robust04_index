			<p><P> April 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VISITS TO GIVE L.A. TASTE OF MEXICAN POLITICS  </P> <P> The passion and controversy surrounding the 1988 Mexican presidential election  are likely to erupt again this weekend when President Carlos Salinas de Gortari  and his chief antagonist, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, come to Los Angeles to visit  their expatriate countrymen and supporters.  </P> <P> In an unusual turn of events, the two men on Monday will be competing for  favorable publicity in different parts of the city.  </P> <P> The visits, which both sides portray as coincidental, point up some new  realities about Mexican politics: It is now acceptable to press the flesh  outside of Mexico, particularly in Los Angeles, which has the world's largest  Mexican population outside Mexico City. It is the first visit here by a sitting  Mexican president in 18 years.  </P> <P> The U.S. dollars earned by Mexican workers who have come to the United States  are becoming a potent force south of the border. In addition, the allegiances  of Chicanos -- U.S. citizens of Mexican descent -- have become more important  to Mexican power brokers since former Mexican President Luis Echeverria first  suggested in the early 1970s that Chicanos were as important to Mexico as  American Jews were to Israel.  </P> <P> The idea of having some of the Mexican president's thunder stolen by Cardenas'  simultaneous visit has irked some officials in Salinas' ruling party, but they  are careful not to say anything that would inflame passions.  </P> <P> "He (Cardenas) is a free Mexican," a government spokesman said. "He can go  wherever he wants for whatever purpose he has."  </P> <P> Cardenas, the son of a revered former president of Mexico, has charged that the  election 20 months ago was stolen from him.  </P> <P> Cardenas is scheduled to arrive in Los Angeles tonight, while Salinas will fly  in Sunday night.  </P> <P> "The Mexican community of Southern California rejects and repudiates the visit  of the so-called president of Mexico, the usurper -- Carlos Salinas de  Gortari," thundered Cardenas supporter Pedro Arias, one of several Latino  activists who held a news conference in Boyle Heights on Friday to protest  Salinas' controversial election and his Los Angeles visit.  </P> <P> A Salinas spokesman, who insisted on anonymity when reached in Mexico City,  retorted: "What lies. This was the fairest election in Mexico's history. The  president is going to Los Angeles on an unofficial visit to unite people, even  those who throw stones at us."  </P> <P> Cardenas, a former governor, quit the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party  (PRI) and ran under the banner of the Democratic Revolution Party, a coalition  of left-of-center groups. Although the ruling party has won elections in the  past with overwhelming numbers, Cardenas received an unheard-of amount of votes  for a challenger -- 31%.  </P> <P> Salinas, the ruling party's candidate, was named the winner with only 50.36%,  the lowest margin of victory in the party's 61-year history. A third candidate,  the late Manuel J. Clouthier, was third with 17.07%.  </P> <P> Despite the totals, Cardenas and his supporters charged widespread voter fraud,  something the PRI has frequently been accused of.  </P> <P> While Salinas is constitutionally prohibited from seeking another six-year  term, Cardenas has been traveling throughout the United States and Mexico since  the election, seeking support for another try for the presidency in 1994. He  campaigned in Los Angeles six months ago to raise funds to establish a support  committee in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The first shots over the weekend visits were fired Friday by Cardenas'  partisans.  </P> <P> "We don't want him (Salinas) here," Chicano activist Virginia Reade said at  Friday's news conference. "He wants legitimacy in the U.S., so he has to come  here."  </P> <P> The Cardenistas said they plan to protest Salinas' speech Monday at a meeting  of the American Newspaper Publishers Assn. in Century City. They also  questioned the appropriateness of Cesar Chavez, the head of the United Farm  Workers of America, meeting with the Mexican president after the speech to  discuss a landmark Mexican law extending medical benefits to the Mexican  families of citizens working in the fields of the United States.  </P> <P> Reade and others said they would try to dissuade Chavez from appearing with  Salinas.  </P> <P> Asked about the trip and the appearance with Chavez, the presidential spokesman  in Mexico City said Salinas accepted the invitation from the newspaper  publishers several months ago, "some time before it was known that Mr. Cardenas  would be in Los Angeles at the same time."  </P> <P> "The president is obligated to look after all Mexicans, wherever they live, and  this legislation is part of that obligation," the spokesman said.  </P> <P> Under the legislation, the families living in Mexico of about 100,000 farmhands  and others would receive benefits from the Mexican equivalent of the Social  Security Administration. Officials in Mexico City could not immediately explain  the specifics of how the program would operate.  </P> <P> The speech and the scheduled ceremony with Chavez are major items on the  Mexican president's itinerary Monday. According to officials at the Mexican  Consulate in Los Angeles, he also is scheduled to meet with Mexican-American  business leaders and activists in separate meetings.  </P> <P> He is scheduled to return to Mexico City on Monday night.  </P> <P> While Salinas spends Monday on the Westside, Cardenas is scheduled to give  several talks near downtown Los Angeles. He is set to appear at a morning  fund-raiser for his local supporters at a Chinatown restaurant.  </P> <P> Later, Cardenas has scheduled a meeting with editors at The Times.  </P> <P> Cardenas is scheduled to attend a private party tonight in Montebello shortly  after his arrival.  </P> <P> On Sunday evening, he is one of several speakers expected to address a Santa  Monica dinner staged by the Americans for Democratic Action, a liberal  political action group.  </P></p>

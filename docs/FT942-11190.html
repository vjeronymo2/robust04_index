			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / International Company News: US carrier posts Dollars 71.6m deficit in first quarter Continental Airlines, the Texas-based carrier that emerged from its second bankruptcy in April last year, yesterday reported a net loss of Dollars 71.6m for the first quarter. It blamed the effects of an exceptionally severe winter on its operations in the north-east US and teething troubles associated with the rapid expansion of its low-cost, no-frills services on short-haul routes. The loss appeared to mark an improvement on the net loss of Dollars 107.9m in last year's first quarter, but the previous year's figures are not strictly comparable because the company was recapitalised when it emerged from bankruptcy. A better indicator was the performance at the operating level, where operating losses were unchanged at Dollars 55.2m. This was in sharp contrast with last year's fourth quarter when the company reported operating profit of Dollars 8.5m, compared with operating losses of Dollars 43.7m the previous time. Most other US airlines have reported first-quarter losses this year because of bad winter weather or low-fare competition, but most have improved their performance from last year because of a slight increase in revenues and a big fall in fuel costs. Continental's revenues were unchanged at Dollars 1.4bn, and nearly all the reduction in net losses was attributable to a tax credit of Dollars 42.8m. Fully diluted loss per share was Dollars 2.86. Mr Robert Ferguson, chief executive, said the severe winter had cost the airline an estimated Dollars 28m in lost revenues. That and teething troubles with the expansion of its low-cost flights had caused the proportion of scheduled services completed to fall to 95.3 per cent from 98.3 per cent. Mr Ferguson said the operational problems had been mostly corrected and the company had achieved a significant operating and bottom-line profit in March. He said the low-cost operation - dubbed CALite - was exceeding its financial targets and Continental was 'ever more confident' of its success.</p>

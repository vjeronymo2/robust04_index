			<p><P> July 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART BUCHWALD: THE NUTS AND BOLTS OF A DEFENSE ISSUE  </P> <P> Every evening there seems to be another story on the television about  distinguished businessmen in white collars cheating the government out of  millions of dollars. Just the other night I saw a piece where a spare parts  manufacturer and his sons were indicted for supplying faulty parts, which could  cause hundreds of planes and helicopters to crash.  </P> <P> Archibald, who always thinks that big business is getting a bad rap, told me,  "They didn't do it. No American would make spare parts and risk injuring our  fighting men."  </P> <P> "Even for money?" I asked.  </P> <P> "Suppose they did do it," he said. "I'm sure that their lawyers have a very  reasonable explanation."  </P> <P> "Isn't there enough money in defense contracts so that they don't have to  cheat?"  </P> <P> "Sometimes there is and sometimes people like to make a little extra for a  rainy day. I'd be amazed if the gentlemen in question would do something to  damage their reputation with the Pentagon. I think that some wise-guy  whistleblower went to the press with a cockamamie story that the company was  using junk metal instead of the new stuff, and the reporter bought it. None of  us can control what gets into the newspapers."  </P> <P> "Fine and dandy -- but suppose the metal for the spare parts cracked and caused  a helicopter to nose-dive into the ground?"  </P> <P> "That's a hypothetical question. The company wouldn't sell spare parts like  that because its officers don't want to go to jail."  </P> <P> I said, "Nobody is going to go to jail and you know it. I'll bet the people in  charge only get a $10,000 fine and 15 hours of community service."  </P> <P> Archibald replied, "That's a stiff sentence for someone who only manufactured a  few nuts and bolts that don't fit together. There is a prejudice against  white-collar criminals in this country and it has to stop. These men overcame  many obstacles before they reached the top, and it's wrong to take their gains  away from them because they can't tell the difference between old metal and  new."  </P> <P> "Should the judge make them promise not to cheat on their spare parts again?"  </P> <P> "That's a tough call. If I made spare parts I wouldn't want anyone telling me  what to do. The Defense Department has many ways to ensure that it gets what it  pays for."  </P> <P> "That doesn't seem to be the case in this situation."  </P> <P> Archibald said, "You're on their side."  </P> <P> "Whose side?"  </P> <P> "The prosecutors who are trying to send the guys with the white collars up the  river."  </P> <P> "If you want me to be honest with you, I wouldn't mind if they got 40 years."  </P> <P> "For what?"  </P> <P> "Just to teach them a lesson. I figure if they did 40 years they wouldn't cheat  again."  </P> <P> Archibald asked, "Have you ever heard the expression, 'Let the buyer beware'?  Well, that's the way we should all feel about spare parts. If the people who  fly the planes can't tell the good nuts from the bad ones, they ought to go  into some other business. What makes our defense so appealing is that some of  our finest weapons are as imperfect as we are."  </P></p>

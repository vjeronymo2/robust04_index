			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Sofia, June 24 (BTA) -- The units on duty of  Bulgaria's air force registered a violation of Bulgarian air  space by 21 light transport aircraft at 10.40 a.m. local time  [0740 GMT] on June 23, the Defence Ministry's Press Office  reported. [passage omitted]    In its newscast tonight national television aired a report  on  the incident from Sofia Airport. Three French and German sports  planes landed at Sofia Airport yesterday [23 June] noon on their  way back from an exposition in Turkey, it said. The traffic  controller on duty would not be videotaped. The TV reporter  learnt from another controller the planes had asked permission  but the request had arrived late for technical reasons. An  investigation is underway; this is the reason behind traffic  controllers' unwillingness to be shown on TV.</p>

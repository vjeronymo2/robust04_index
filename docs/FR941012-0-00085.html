			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Backcuts should be made on the same level as the point  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the notch of the undercut. The hinge is what keeps  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the tree from kicking back, not the fact that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> backcut is higher than the undercut. High backcuts run  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the risk of cutting off the hinge, actually increasing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the danger of kickback (Ex. 5&hyph;52).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Other commenters said that backcuts above the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> horizontal cut were not as critical when using the Humboldt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> undercutting method (Ex. 5&hyph;42, 9&hyph;15). They said that when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the slanting cut of the undercut is angled downward, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tree is more likely to fall in the intended direction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without kicking back. However, one of these commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> admitted that placing the backcut at the same level as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> horizontal cut when using the Humboldt undercut method  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sacrificed safety for quality control:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Quality control concerns with several companies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dictate that only Humboldt undercuts are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permissible with sawlog grade timber, so that wood  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loss is minimized by taking the notch wood out of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the stump. Quality control often dictates that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there must be a flush surface on the end of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> log. To avoid having to make another cut to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> square up a log butt, fallers will attempt to make  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their backcuts meet the horizontal face cut as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> closely as possible. By doing this, they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sacrifice the safety of the step that would have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been left on the stump to catch a possible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> backwards-moving tree butt, and depend only on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> downward-slanting face on the stump to hold the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tree (Ex. 9&hyph;15). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two commenters said the backcut requirement should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limited to those situations when tree kickback is a problem,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which they contended was only on steep terrain, when felling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> uphill or through trees (Ex. 9&hyph;1, 9&hyph;4). Other commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> said that believed that the standard should provide more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flexibility because variations frequently found on logging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sites, such as lean of the tree and type of terrain, would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> make strict adherence to the regulation difficult (Ex. 5&hyph;19,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9&hyph;9, 9&hyph;22; Tr. OR 206&hyph;7, 395&hyph;96). These commenters said  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the cutting decisions should be left to the judgment of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the experienced feller.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After reviewing the evidence in the record, OSHA has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decided that the proposed backcut provisions are necessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to protect fellers from being hit or crushed by the tree  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they are felling. As discussed above, the record shows that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> injuries and fatalities have occurred because of improper  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cutting methods. The purpose of undercutting and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> backcutting trees is to prevent the tree from splitting,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> felling an unintended direction or kicking back into the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> feller. OSHA agrees with ANSI and the various State plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States that the proposed backcut provisions are necessary to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protect employees against these hazards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA does not agree that backcutting should be limited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only to those situations when tree kickback can occur. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> record shows that hazards other than tree kickback  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessitate the backcut requirement. Without appropriately- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> placed backcuts, trees are more likely to split and/or fall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in an unintended direction. While OSHA agrees that it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more likely that this could happen when trees are felled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> uphill, OSHA also believes the record shows that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possibility exists regardless of the terrain. According to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the WIR survey, the single largest cause of injuries  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reported was being hit by a falling tree (Ex. 2&hyph;1). Almost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one-half of all injuries reported were due to employees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> being hit or crushed by a falling tree.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the final rule OSHA has provided an exception to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> backcut requirement. The final rule allows the backcut to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be placed at or below the horizontal cut in tree pulling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations. Various State logging standards also provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this exception to the backcut requirement (e.g., Ex. 38K).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA believes this exception covers those situations in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which a special cutting technique may be required, such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by Federal agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From BTA press review] </F>   [Text] Sofia, March 16 (BTA) -- The political problems  resulting from Prime Minister Lyuben Berov's illness are in the  highlights of today's press. KONTINENT writes that Mr.  Aleksandur Pramatarski, vice president of the Democratic Party  in the Union of Democratic Forces (SDS), told its National  Coordinating Council yesterday that a cabinet crisis is to be  expected on March 21. The commentary goes on to say that the  problem with the cabinet will most probably be solved before the  national conference of the SDS in May and the new government is  likely to be headed by Georgi Markov of the Democratic Party,  who recently left the parliamentary SDS to become an independent  MP. This situation is another godsend for the SDS, reads the  commentary in KONTINENT. Yesterday President Zhelev and SDS  leader Filip Dimitrov had lunch together but refused to comment  on their meeting, writes 24 CHASA, quoting the Balkan News  Agency. Actually, the SDS is not seeking to provoke a cabinet  crisis, or is at least trying to postpone it because it is not  ready for elections, reads an article in STANDART NEWS. "A  diseased government cannot run a diseased state," writes the  Bulgarian Agrarian Party's daily ZEMEDELSKO ZNAME. Now there is  no one responsible for this country's government, says a  commentary in the SDS daily DEMOKRATSIYA headlined "BSP Alone Is  Blind to the Crisis". EKSPRES writes that the prime minister's  wife told BSP leader Zhan Videnov over the phone that Professor  Berov hopes to return to his office soon. The Socialist DUMA  daily writes that the prime minister's illness has made the SDS  put off its national conference until May. The same daily  quotes the deputy chairman of the National Coordinating Council  of the SDS, Mr. Stefan Sofiyanski, as saying that Deputy Prime  Minister Valentin Karabashev and the acting Prime Minister  Evgeni Matinchev are squabbling while this country is  suffocating in a tightening economic knot.    [Sofia Khorizont Radio Network in Bulgarian at 1100 GMT on  16  March reports two statements by a spokesperson of the SDS  National Coordinating Council and by presidential spokesman  Valentin Stoyanov, both denying that President Zhelyu Zhelev and  SDS leader Filip Dimitrov held any meeting in Sofia on 15 May.  Stoyanov is reported to have said that "the Balkan News Agency  report on any meeting between President Zhelev and Filip  Dimitrov is incorrect from beginning to end."]</p>

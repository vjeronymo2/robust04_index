			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / World Trade News: EU turns Mideast commercial matchmaker - Mark Nicholson watched a 'dating agency' for Arab and Israeli businesses in action in Cairo Almost 1,000 small and medium-sized European and Middle Eastern companies yesterday wound up a three-day commercial matchmaking forum sponsored by the European Union to promote European-Middle Eastern business ties, and cross-border alliances within the region itself. It was the first time Israeli and Arab businesses had met openly to discuss business deals on such a scale, and it was hailed by organisers and participants alike yesterday as a success. 'The important thing was how completely normal it was to see Israeli and Arab businessmen dealing with each other,' said Ms Anahid Harrison, the project's co-ordinator. 'There was no sense of strangeness.' The companies, embracing construction, tourism, electrical, electronic, textiles, engineering and other industries, were brought together for 10,500 face-to-face meetings after being matched by the computerised equivalent of a corporate dating agency. The event was the first of a seven-year-old EU programme, known as Europartenariat, to be held outside Europe. It was designed, according to Mr Raniero Vanni D'Archirafi, EU commissioner for internal markets, to translate Israel's peace accords with Jordan and the Palestinians into 'practical programmes for economic development'. EU officials said they hoped to repeat the event every two years. Extrapolating from the results of previous Europartenariat events, organisers say up to 40 per cent of the thousands of direct meetings result in long-term business alliances or joint ventures. In an informal poll, participants said they believed well over half their meetings would result in future business co-operation. On that basis, and judging from the enthusiastic reports of many Arab and - particularly - Israeli businesses, the event is likely to have given the most tangible nudge yet to Israeli-Arab commercial co-operation. 'The main interest for Israeli companies has been to meet possible partners in the region - for Israeli business there's no problem for them meeting European partners. We're here to meet the Egyptians and Jordanians,' said Mr Michael Admon of the Israel Export Institute. Although Syria and Lebanon boycotted the meeting - as they have all multilateral events involving Israel in the absence of their own peace accords with the Jewish state - more than 540 Israeli, Egyptian, Palestinian and Jordanian businesses participated, alongside more than 400 European companies. Several Middle Eastern businessmen expressed disappointment at the quality and representation of European companies at the meeting, the bulk of which were from Germany, France, Italy and Belgium. 'Most of them are just here to find ways of selling their products,' said one Jordanian businessman. 'The most activity was among Middle Eastern companies doing deals with each other,' said Mr Wael Amin, manager of PIE, one of Egypt's biggest software companies, who said he expected to enter agreements with Israeli partners to develop and market Arabic software to the Gulf states. 'It's still a bit premature for the Europeans to be treating the Middle East as a unified market.' Many Arab participants expressed surprise at how straightforward and politically uncomplicated it proved to deal with their Israeli counterparts. 'I was expecting a wall as high as the ceiling,' said one Jordanian hotelier after meetings with Jewish travel agents. 'I found I just had to step over a little 10cm barrier.' But there was also evidence that not all political barriers in the region have quite vanished. A 38-strong Israeli dance troupe due to perform at a gala soiree during the event, for instance, unaccountably failed to receive visas from the Egyptian authorities.</p>

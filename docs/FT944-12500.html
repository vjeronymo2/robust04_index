			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / International Company News: Ziff disposes of database unit Thomson Corporation, the travel and publishing group controlled by the Thomson family of Toronto, Canada, is to acquire a Ziff Communications subsidiary, Information Access Company, for Dollars 465m. The deal is the second step in Ziff's plan to divest all of its assets. Last week Ziff, a privately held US publishing group, sold the biggest segment of its business, Ziff-Davis Publishing, to Forstmann Little, a New York investment group, for Dollars 1.4bn. IAC, based in Foster City, California, is a leading provider of reference and database services to libraries and businesses. It offers a wide range of business, legal, healthcare, humanities, computer and general interest information services in several electronic formats, including CD-ROM, on-line database access, and magnetic tape. More than 20,000 US public and academic libraries, as well as 10,000 corporate libraries, subscribe to IAC services. The acquisition is seen as a move by Thomson to expand its North American publishing activities, which are among the most profitable parts of its business. Thomson was one of the losing bidders for another database company, the Lexis/Nexis electronic-publishing arm of Mead of the US which was bought for Dollars 1.5bn by Reed Elsevier, the Anglo-Dutch publishing group, earlier this month. With 1993 sales of Dollars 5.9bn, Thomson is a leading publisher of specialised professional and business reference materials. The group also owns several regional newspapers in North America and the UK, including its flagship publication, the Toronto Globe and Mail. Thomson's Information/Publishing Group accounted for Dollars 2.8bn in sales last year. In the UK, Thomson also has extensive leisure travel operations, including its holiday tour business.</p>

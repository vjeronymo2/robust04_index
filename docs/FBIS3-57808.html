			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Michael Anders] </F>   [Text] Hamburg, Germany, Jan 1 (AFP) -- The leader of the  Russian extreme-right, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, has threatened to  station 300,000 troops in Germany and "completely destroy" it  with the launch of "World War III," the WELT AM SONNTAG  newspaper reported.    The weekly newspaper to be published Sunday [2 January]  based  its story on German intelligence and diplomatic reports of  Zhirinovskiy's reaction following the German government's  rejection Wednesday of his application, made in Bulgaria, for a  visa to visit Germany again.    Just before Christmas the Russian rightwing extremist did  visit Germany, meeting with the head of a German far-right  party, Gerhard Frey of the German People's Union (DVU).    Quoting a secret service tape-recording and a report by the  German Embassy in Sofia, WELT AM SONNTAG said Zhirinovskiy  threatened that, if he came to power, Russia would break off  diplomatic relations and, rather than withdraw its remaining  troops, station 300,000 of them in Germany.    From a figure of 550,000 in 1990, the number of Russian  troops and their families on German soil has fallen to 70,000  today, and they are all due to depart by August 31, 1994.    Asked by a member of the German Embassy in Sofia if he  wanted  to occupy Germany militarily, Zhirinovskiy reportedly said that  the soldiers should "ensure the compensation for Russian damages  suffered in World War II." Germany would have to pay, to the  extent of becoming a "poor country," he said.    Zhirinovskiy told the diplomat that Wednesday's rejection of  his visa application could lead to a "third World War" by which  Germany would be "completely destroyed."    According to WELT AM SONNTAG, Zhirinovskiy also made  personal  threats against German diplomats, vowing that the one who  informed him his visa application was refused would soon be  "liquidated." He claimed to have such good contacts with  Russian intelligence that he could make the official simply  "disappear."    The newspaper also reported that the German intelligence  services were stepping up their surveillance of the  international and German activities of rightwing extremists such  as Zhirinovskiy and his party.    To the surprise and consternation of Western governments,  Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Democratic Party won 23 percent of the  vote in the Russian legislative elections held December 12,  making it the second strongest party in the Russian parliament.    Zhirinovskiy has widely been portrayed as a fascist with  ideas akin to those of Adolf Hitler. He and the DVU leader Frey  embraced warmly when they met at Munich airport last month.</p>

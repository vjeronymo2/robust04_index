			<p><P> October 10, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> COWBOYS PUT WALKER ON BLOCK; AGENTS STUDY CONTRACT CHANGES  </P> <P> The Dallas Cowboys had an open "fire sale" on running back Herschel Walker  today while NFL owners met several miles away trying to pick a new  commissioner.  </P> <P> Agents Peter Johnson and Ralph Cindrich were considering a restructuring of  Walker's $1-million-per-year contract as part of the price for his leaving the  Cowboys.  </P> <P> "The ball's in Herschel's court now," a Cowboys source said. "It's up to him to  make a deal."  </P> <P> The NFL trade deadline is next Tuesday.  </P> <P> The Minnesota Vikings have dangled two No. 1 draft picks, several other high  picks and two starters as trade bait.  </P> <P> "It's difficult to think of the Dallas Cowboys without Herschel Walker, but we  can't close our eyes and ears to anything that might help the club," Coach  Jimmy Jones said. "I'll be in touch with his agents today."  </P></p>

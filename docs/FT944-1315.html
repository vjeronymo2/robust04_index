			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Ministers retreat on Companies House sell-off The government yesterday stepped back from the wholesale privatisation of Companies House, the official repository of corporate information, but will go ahead with a programme of contracting out specific services, Jim Kelly writes. Companies House is based in Cardiff and has five regional offices. Last year it handled the incorporation of more than 100,000 new companies. It holds details on nearly 1m companies. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said in a written parliamentary answer that it would remain an executive agency of the government. Last week it was announced that the Patent Office would remain in the public sector. Mr Heseltine said that SRU, a private consultancy, had been appointed in July this year 'to explore further with the market how best to contract out most of the services of Companies House'.</p>

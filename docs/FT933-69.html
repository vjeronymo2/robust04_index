			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of Japanese Companies - Financial Review (9): Production moves overseas - One effect of the rise in the yen's value IN TOKUSHIMA prefecture, on the south-western island of Shikoku, a 42-year-old factory which assembles stereos and radio cassette players for overseas markets will cease production at the end of October. The factory, owned by Sanritsu Electric, an affiliate of Sanyo Electric, is one of a growing number of electronics suppliers which have fallen victim to the rising value of the yen. This summer, Sanyo put in its last order to Sanritsu and told the company it would shift production outside Japan. For Japanese manufacturers, already suffering from a downturn in domestic demand, the impact of the yen's sharp rise this year has been devastating. While people in many other countries would welcome a strong national currency, for a population that depends for over 18 per cent of real GNP on exports, a strong yen has brought more grief than joy. According to an estimate by Wako Research Institute, a private organisation, a Y1 rise in the yen vis-a-vis the dollar has the effect of reducing Japan's GNP by 0.06 per cent. On that basis, the near Y20 rise of the yen this year could wipe 1.2 per cent off the value of the country's production. The negative effects of a higher yen reach across a wide range of industrial sectors, from heavy industries such as steel and shipbuilding to services such as shipping and air transport to high technology electronics, cars and precision machinery. Companies ranging from Matsushita, the largest consumer electronics maker in the world, to Japan Air Lines have all suffered from the loss of cost competitiveness and the decline in overseas profits resulting from a higher yen. However, public sympathy has been directly mainly to the plight of the electronics and car industry, which are widely seen to have been the engines of Japanese economic growth in recent years. As the fate of Sanritsu Electric indicates, the yen's rise, which has been much faster and sharper this year than companies expected, has had an immediate impact on the profitability of electronics makers and forced them to review their manufacturing plans. JVC, the maker of audio-visual equipment, recently announced that the yen's rise was forcing it to revise its profits forecast for the year to next March. On a consolidated basis JVC expects a loss of Y31bn instead of Y800m as forecast earlier this year. Sony says that a rise of Y1 against the dollar reduces its prospective profits by Y5bn. The pressures on the Japanese car industry are no less severe. At Y110 to the dollar, Toyota says it would hardly make any profits. If the yen rises to Y100 to the dollar, 'Japanese manufacturers would not be able to exist,' it warns. The exchange rate has forced electronics companies and auto makers to consider shifting a larger proportion of their production overseas to reduce costs. In electronics, the manufacture of products with low value-added, such as small TV sets, has already shifted to lower-cost areas such as Thailand and Malaysia. Overseas production of colour TVs by Japanese manufacturers has exceeded domestic production since 1988. However, the yen's recent surge has meant that companies have had to expand the range and volume of overseas production. Sony plans to manufacture 8mm camcorders in Shanghai from November, though other manufacturers have opted to keep production in Japan. At the same time, to reduce costs, electronics companies are looking to increase procurement from overseas. In the computer industry, for example, Fujitsu intends to double procurement of foreign parts by 1995. Car companies are also trying to raise their global manufacturing efficiency. Honda is moving the entire production of its four-door Civic and Accord cars for the North American market to the US while Toyota has decided regularly to import crankshafts and cylinder blocks from its UK engine plant for use in engines that will go into cars destined for Japan and other big markets. Most Japanese manufacturers accept that, since the yen is so high, one of the main keys to success, if not survival, will be their ability to transfer production overseas and reduce costs by increasing foreign procurement. Steps are being taken in that direction, but it is not an easy route for most Japanese companies. For one thing, since Japanese companies do not, as a rule, resort to redundancies, the transfer of manufacturing overseas raises the problem of what to do with the surplus labour that will result in Japan. Executives of manufacturing companies have been speaking out publicly on the dangers of a hollowing out of Japanese industry as a result of the yen's appreciation, reflecting the concerns that many have about their ability to ride out the crisis without resorting to western-style redundancies and plant closures. Furthermore, Japanese manufacturers have to worry about the plight of their suppliers. In many cases, especially among electronics companies and carmakers, these close ties extend to equity holdings. In the past, these ties enabled manufacturers to urge suppliers to work on gruelling production schedules or meet stringent cost demands. While carmakers admit that it would reduce costs if they bought a larger volume of components from overseas, they say that would deal a serious blow to their own suppliers, who are already suffering because of slower demand in the domestic car market. However, many Japanese companies are gradually preparing for a further transfer of manufacturing overseas by reducing their workforce through natural attrition, a reduction of new recruits, and for the more hard-pressed, voluntary early retirement schemes. More manufacturers are asking suppliers to look outside traditional corporate groupings for business. Nevertheless, the last strong rise of the yen in the mid-1980s strengthened the competitiveness of Japanese manufacturers after they took steps to cut costs and raise profitability. It may well be that the pressures of the yen's rise will once again act as a spur to raise Japanese companies' efficiency by forcing decisions that under more moderate circumstances would have been too painful to make.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Documentation of the Region 6 evaluation, including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> details of the review procedure, is contained in a memorandum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Attachment A) in the TSD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, please reference Appendix AK of the El Paso CO SIP for specific details on the State inventory. Finally, it should be noted that no later than September 30, 1995, and no later than the end of each three year period thereafter (until the area is redesignated to attainment), the TACB (now TNRCC) will be required to submit to the EPA a revised inventory meeting the requirements of sections 187(a)(1) and 187(a)(5) of the CAA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Nonattainment New Source Review (NSR) Permit Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The State of Texas submitted NSR regulatory revisions to the EPA on May 13, 1992, and November 3, 1992, respectively. NSR regulatory revisions were also included in a submittal by the State on August 31, 1993. The revisions were due independently of the November 15, 1992, moderate CO nonattainment area SIP requirements addressed in this FR action. The EPA action on the El Paso CO nonattainment NSR permit program will be addressed in detail in future separate FR notices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Contingency Measures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As per section 172(c)(9) of the CAA, all nonattainment SIPs must contain contingency measures (due November 15, 1993) that are to be implemented if the area fails to make reasonable further progress (RFP) or to attain the NAAQS by the applicable date. These contingency measures are to be implemented immediately after the EPA determines failure of RFP or attainment of standards. The contingency measures for the El Paso SIP, due independently of the November 15, 1992, moderate CO nonattainment area SIP requirements addressed in this FR action, were received by the EPA Region 6 on November 15, 1993, and will be addressed in a separate FR action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 5. I/M SIP Revision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 187(a)(4) of the CAA provides a savings clause for vehicle I/M programs. All moderate CO nonattainment SIPs must include a vehicle I/M program as described in section 182(a)(2)(B). The State of Texas adopted State rules and currently is operating a State I/M program in El Paso, Texas. The State of Texas has also submitted a committal SIP for the El Paso CO nonattainment area to the EPA, in accordance with provisions of the General Preamble (57 FR 13530), stating that a comprehensive SIP revision will be submitted to the EPA by November 15, 1993, which will upgrade the existing El Paso, Texas, I/M program to meet the new requirements mandated by the CAAA of 1990. The EPA proposed approval of the committal SIP in a separate FR action published on September 27, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Oxygenated Fuels Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Motor vehicles are significant contributors of CO emissions. An important measure toward reducing these emissions is the use of cleaner-burning oxygenated gasoline. Extra oxygen, contained within the oxygenate in the fuel, enhances fuel combustion and helps to offset fuel-rich operating conditions, particularly during vehicle starting, which are more prevalent in the winter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 211(m) of the CAAA requires that various States submit revisions to their SIPs, and implement oxygenated gasoline programs by no later than November 1, 1992. This requirement applies to all States with CO nonattainment areas with design values of 9.5 ppm. or more, which is based generally on 1988 and 1989 data. Each State's oxygenated gasoline program must require gasoline sold or dispensed in the specified control area to contain not less than 2.7 percent oxygen by weight during that portion of the year in which the area is prone to high ambient concentrations of CO (the control period).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA announced guidance on the establishment of control periods, by area, in the FR on October 20, 1992. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The EPA also announced the availability of oxygenated gasoline credit program guidelines in the October 20, 1992, FR. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Under a credit program, marketable oxygen credits may be generated from the sale of gasoline with a higher oxygen content than is required (i.e., an oxygen content greater than 2.7 percent by weight). These oxygen credits may be used to offset the sale of gasoline with a lower oxygen content than is required. As an alternate to the credit program, the State may elect a program in which a minimum of 2.7 percent by weight oxygen must be present in every gallon of gasoline sold.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  See ``Guidelines for Oxygenated Gasoline Credit Programs and Guidelines on Establishment of Control Periods under section 211(m) of the CAA as Amended_Notice of Availability,'' 57 FR 47849 (October 20, 1992).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  See note 4, above.

These labeling regulations were published in the FR on October 20, 1992. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  See ``Notice of Final Oxygenated Fuels Labeling Regulations under section 211(m) of the Clean Air Act as Amended_Notice of Final Rulemaking,'' 57 FR 47769.

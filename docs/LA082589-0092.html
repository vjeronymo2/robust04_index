			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> LEBANON'S RIVAL SHIITE FORCES UNITE AGAINST FRENCH  </P> <P> Rival Shiite Muslim militias said Thursday that they had united against a  French naval force off Lebanon, and the radical Hezbollah faction said its  response will "horrify everybody" if the warships approach.  </P> <P> Hezbollah, or Party of God, did not say what it would do, but it has threatened  suicide attacks on Western targets and is believed to sponsor Shiite gangs that  hold most of the 14 Western hostages.  </P> <P> Hezbollah and Amal, a more moderate Shiite militia, have fought a bloody power  struggle for 16 months but said they were joining forces against "this  American-Israeli-French plot."  </P> <P> Police said one person was killed and three were wounded in shelling along the  line that divides the capital into Muslim West Beirut and the Christian eastern  sector.  </P> <P> Skirmishes along the line have occurred daily since an artillery war began  March 8 between the 20,000 members of Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun's Christian army  and a Muslim alliance led by the 40,000 Syrian soldiers in Lebanon.  </P> <P> Lebanese military sources said French vessels were cruising 40 miles off  Lebanon. The French say the ships are on a "humanitarian mission," to evacuate  the French citizens in Lebanon if necessary.  </P></p>

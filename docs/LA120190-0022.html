			<p><P> December 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEATING 49ERS NOT ENOUGH FOR RAM FANS  </P> <P> In a recent story, John Shaw stated that "management would take some major  actions" if the Rams' record does not improve.  </P> <P> Instead of fueling speculation regarding the future of John Robinson, Shaw's  statement gave me hope that Georgia Frontiere will finally sell the team.  </P> <P> Maybe Georgia can buy a chain of beauty shops with the profits she makes from  the sale of the Rams. We'll never have another Super Bowl team until we have a  Super Bowl-type owner and management.  </P> <P> KENT McCLISH  </P> <P> San Juan Capistrano  </P></p>

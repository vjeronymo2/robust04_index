			<p>BFN     [Text] Corfu, Greece, June 25 (AFP) -- The European Union  [EU] has pledged ECU500 million (575 million dollars) towards  shutting down Ukraine's Chernobyl nuclear plant, site of the  world's worst civilian nuclear accident, French President  Francois Mitterrand said Saturday [25 June].    Speaking after the two-day summit ended here, he said the  12-member European Union would seek more funding for this  purpose from other industrialized countries at the Group of  Seven summit in Naples, Italy, next month.    The sum pledged by the EU includes a loan of ECU400 million  and a gift of ECU100 million.    The summiteers agreed during the two-day meeting on the  necessity of closing down Ukraine's dangerous Chernobyl nuclear  reactor. Britain, France, Germany and Italy said they would  press for an agreement on the financing of the shutdown at the  G7 summit.    It is a "very important area," Mitterrand said, adding that  the EU plan for shutting down Chernobyl included "overall reform  of the energy sector" in the former Soviet republic of the  Ukraine.    Before the EU summit, France and Germany sent a joint letter  to their partners stressing the urgency of a quick and total  shutdown of the entire Chernobyl complex, where the April 1986  nuclear disaster was caused by an explosion in one of its  reactors.</p>

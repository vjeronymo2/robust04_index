			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent ITAR-TASS Yuriy Shcherban] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 10 May -- The SCSE [State Committee for the  State of Emergency] court case has finally been abandoned.  ITAR-TASS learned today at the press service of the military  collegium of the Russian Federation Supreme Court that Judge  Viktor Yaskin has closed this criminal case. It has not been  closed only in the case of Valentin Varennikov, who has refused  the amnesty announced by the State Duma.    The SCSE case has initially been dropped in connection with  the amnesty, however this decision was later contested by the  office of the Procurator General on the basis that any criminal  case must proceed to the end.    The appeal was accepted by the collegium of the Supreme  court  and the SCSE case was sent back for a new trial. However, in  this instance it did not come under the same article of the  criminal code, on the basis of which the procuracy had launched  its protest.    Therefore, having studied the SCSE case, Judge Yaskin has  stopped the proceedings.    Although this decision does not involve Varennikov, it is  not  yet clear whether he will have to stand trial. At any rate, the  military collegium of the Supreme Court of the Russian  Federation has not taken any decision yet with regard to this  matter.</p>

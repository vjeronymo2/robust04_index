			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Threat of post disruption grows THE THREAT of London-wide disruption to the postal service drew nearer yesterday as members of the Union of Communication Workers, the main Post Office union, voted to go on strike. Talks between the union and management of Royal Mail, the letters arm of the Post Office, are due on Monday in an attempt to avert the action. The UCW is protesting over the planned closure of five sorting offices in the capital and the loss of 6,000 jobs over the next three years. Mr Alan Johnson, UCW general secretary designate, said a strike 'will have a devastating effect in London because there will be no deliveries at all in the capital'. It could also hit deliveries elsewhere, he said. No dates have yet been set for the industrial action, which would not involve parcel deliveries or the Post Office Counters network. Mr Johnson said the union was not optimistic about progress at the talks on Monday but remained 'willing to use any opportunity to negotiate a satisfactory settlement without recourse to industrial action'. The UCW accepts the closure of some of the offices, but wants guarantees that there will be no compulsory redundancies or compulsory transfers to other sorting offices. Mr Brian Thomson, general manager of Royal Mail's London division, yesterday called the vote to strike 'disappointing'. He added that the UCW leadership did not have a mandate to take action.</p>

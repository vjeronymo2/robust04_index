			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Arts: 'Arte povera' of empty sculpture - William Packer reviews 'Gravity and Grace' at the Hayward Gallery To look back art-historically on the critical orthodoxies of the past is never a bad thing. This winter's exhibition at the Hayward Gallery is a review of sculpture of a particular kind made at a particular time, the product of the international avant-garde of some 20 years ago. Gravity &amp; Grace recalls several polemical and controversial exhibitions of the early 1970s, notably the 11 Los Angeles Artists of 1971, with its portable fish farm by Newton Harrison; The New Art of 1972, that was selected by Anne Seymour; and William Tucker's The Condition of Sculpture of 1975, all of them arranged by the Arts Council at the Hayward Gallery. The 'Gravity' of the present exhibition's title refers specifically to the definition offered by Tucker at that time: 'Sculpture is subject to gravity and revealed by light. Here is the primary condition. Gravity governs sculpture's existence in itself, light discloses sculpture to us.' So seriously, indeed, does Jon Thompson, the organiser of this present exercise, take the Tucker dictum, so central is it to his own debate, if only in opposition, that he reprints Tucker's argument in his own catalogue. 'As I walked round', says Thompson, 'I recall getting more and more angry that so many of my favourite artists were not included . . . I still believe . . . that his position was unnecessarily astringent, and did not properly represent a time of great diversity and change. I hope this exhibition will serve to redress the balance.' Is there, perhaps, the tiniest suspicion that, after all these years, he doth protest just a shade too much? Does the old view, which Tucker chose to recast in contemporary terms- that sculpture exists in the real world, to be considered in its own terms and material presence in relation to human experience- still represent such a rankling threat to the prevailing orthodoxy? Can it really be that there is a balance still to be redressed, from his point of view, in a critical culture that sees Damien Hirst, he of the fly factory and the fish in formaldehyde, as the brightest of our bright young hopes; that this year sends that tired old Duchampian, Richard Hamilton, to represent us at Venice; that, by dint of assiduous promotion over a generation past, has by now established Richard Long and Gilbert &amp; George as the most famous and internationally established of living British artists? Thompson's selection of artists here is international, including several American and a couple of British minimalists and conceptualists, but weighted emphatically towards European artists, most especially those associated with the arte povera of the late 1960s. Such 'Poor Art' was the confection of the Italian critic, Germano Celant, who argued at the time a political and revolutionary engagement and equivalence between art and the various protest movements of the time. Nowadays such over-specific intellectual encumbrances may be lightly cast aside in favour of something more general. In Celant's view, 'poor' art 'prefers essential information', which Thompson glosses as an art 'which is stripped of superfluous meanings. It addresses the viewers on its own terms, without the obfuscations and mediations of existing interpretative structures. Thus the 'poor' work is a 'transparent' work . . . it hides nothing, it carries nothing within its interior space least of all the psychological trappings or biography of its maker . . . it represents a clear shifting of the focus of authority away from the artist to an authority of interpretation invested in and by the viewer.' So there we have it in Thompson's own words: an art for which, if he is divested of all authority, the artist may reasonably accept no responsibility - except, of course, from all the critical plaudits and celebrity, the official patronage and exhibitions, and all the arte povera trappings of conspicuous commercial success. And the 'poor' viewer is left to make of it all just what he will, with only the intellectual blackmail to console him: that is to say, if he can make nothing of it, although there is avowedly nothing there, it is no fault of the artist, but of himself. So we move into the Hayward, and there on its perch sits a resplendent blue and red Macaw eyeing with 'transparent' scepticism the rest of the art-work of which it is the liveliest part: the long trays planted with cacti of 'Untitled 1967' by Jannis Kounellis. There are Barry Flanagan's folded hessian blankets, green, red and yellow, 'Pile 1', and his sacks heaped in a corner with the light shone on them; Bruce Nauman's empty steel cage within a marginally less empty steel cage; Joseph Beuys's row of empty changing-room lockers; Robert Morris's nine empty fibre-glass tubes; Mario Merz's brushwood faggots; and Richard Long's significantly early (1972) circles of pebbles. Also here is Robert Smithson's tower of blue trays full of rocks, with a little note and map to tell us where they were collected, in case we wondered . . . We have seen it all before, often, but there is nothing wrong in that. Only the underlying assumption offends, that what is now academic should be defended and promoted as being of the first current importance, the persistent heresy that only what is avant-garde, soi-disant revolutionary, can ever be truly significant. Within the broader context of the history of art, and of the modern movement in particular, work of this kind had its moment. It took to the limit certain ideas - derived in any case from constructivism and Dada; conducted some useful, even necessary experiments; and made its point as to what might be possible. That is all.

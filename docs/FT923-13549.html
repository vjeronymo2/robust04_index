			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / How regional trading blocs can damage world trade AT THEIR summit last week in Munich, the leaders of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries failed to give any impetus to the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations. Some, notably in the US, will shout even more loudly: 'Global multilateralism is dead; long live regional trading arrangements.' Whether regional blocs are in the interests of those who create them can be questioned. Still more questionable, however, is whether regional trading arrangements are an alternative to global multilateralism. If anything, regionalism makes the case for the global multilateral system even more cogent. What is certain is the growing importance of regional discrimination. The World Bank's latest study of global economic prospects shows that 41.4 per cent of world trade fell within existing regional trading arrangements in 1988 and another 4.9 per cent of world trade within potential new arrangements, such as those between the EC and eastern Europe, and the US and Mexico.(1) Even if trade within the European Community is excluded as now being like trade within one country, 24.8 per cent of world trade falls within existing arrangements and 6.3 per cent more in potential new arrangements. Whether regional arrangements are in the economic interest of the participants depends on the extent of trade creation, as opposed to trade diversion. Trade creation occurs when high-cost domestic producers are replaced by lower-cost producers in the regional partner. Trade diversion occurs when lower-cost external suppliers are replaced by higher-cost suppliers in the regional partner. Clear a priori rules cannot be derived for when a given arrangement will generate beneficial trade creation rather than harmful trade diversion. As the distinguished international economist, Jagdish Bhagwati, argues, geographical proximity is not a sufficient condition.(2) Whether or not regional arrangements may benefit their participants, such arrangements cannot be an alternative to multilateralism. As the chart shows, roughly half of world trade was among broadly defined regions in 1990, not within them. Despite the onward march of regionalism, the proportion of inter-regional trade has declined little since 1973. The only region of the world for which intra-regional trade has looked like a realistic trade strategy is western Europe, where a number of medium to small countries send almost three-quarters of their exports to one another. For North America and Asia, however, markets outside the region account for some two-thirds of total exports. To sacrifice those markets to regional ones would be folly. Not only is multilateral trade hugely important, but the drift to regionalism makes global rules still more essential. As Professor Bhagwati notes, new forms of protectionism, such as anti-dumping and voluntary export restraints, as well as the protectionist use of local content requirements make trade diversion more likely. Global disciplines are needed, therefore, to make regional arrangements less damaging not merely to outsiders, but even to their participants. Will regionalism undermine globalism? A recent study of regionalism from the International Monetary Fund argues that 'beyond a certain threshold an undue emphasis on regionalism would undercut the multilateral trading system and render it inoperative.'(3) If the authors are right, regionalism makes globalism more essential, but simultaneously enfeebles it. This is no cause for celebration.

adjusted, except for the Italian series and the German current account. Imports can be derived by subtracting the visible trade balance from exports. Export and import data are calculated on the FOB (free on board) basis, except for German and Italian imports which use the CIF method (including carriage, insurance and freight charges). German data up to and including June 1990, shown in italics, refer to the former West Germany. The nominal effective exchange rates are period averages of Bank of England trade-weighted indices. Data supplied by Datastream and WEFA from national government and central bank sources.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

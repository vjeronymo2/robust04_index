			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): US shares weaken in line with bond market Wall Street The four-day sell-off in US stocks accelerated yesterday as the yield on the benchmark Treasury bond pushed above an important psychological barrier, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 63.33 weaker at 3,699.02, its lowest level since December 1, 1993. The New York SE's 'uptick rule', which restricts program sales, was implemented late in the session, but it failed to stem the tide. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 dropped 7.98 to 452.48 as declining issues overwhelmed advances by 2,016 to 272. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite was down 7.78 at 454.42. The Nasdaq composite plunged 17.19 to 755.31, bringing its cumulative loss over the past week to 48 points, or nearly 6 per cent. The late recovery in share prices on Monday failed to carry over into yesterday's opening. Again, stocks closely paralleled activity in the US Treasury market, which was hit by renewed selling pressure after a one-day reprieve. In early trading the yield on the 30-year government security again pushed above 7.00 per cent after receding below that level in the previous session. The move yesterday came after the Conference Board said its March consumer confidence index made a stronger than expected recovery from February's weather-related decline. For equity investors, the unsettled mood in the bond market clearly outweighed the implications of more buoyant consumer spending in the coming weeks. The impact of bond yields on market sentiment was clearly reflected in a recommendation issued yesterday by one of Wall Street's biggest brokers. Smith Barney Shearson urged its clients to cut their equity holdings from 55 to 50 per cent of their portfolios, saying the uptrend in interest rates could depress share prices by a further 8.7 per cent before the correction ends. The Dow Industrial index has already dropped by 7 per cent since peaking at the end of January. Cyclical stocks again led blue chips down. Caterpillar fell Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 110, Deere Dollars 3 7/8 to Dollars 81 3/4 and DuPont Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 54 3/8 . But the damage to the market was widespread. Airline and trucking issues were very weak, as reflected in a 2 per cent drop in the Dow Transportation index to 1,675.36. UAL, parent of United Airlines, shed Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 130 1/2 after filing details of a proposed buyout by the carrier's employees with federal regulators. On the Nasdaq, the sell-off in computer-related shares showed no signs of abating. Microsoft slid Dollars 3 7/8 to Dollars 82 1/2 , Intel Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 66 1/4 and WellFleet Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 71. Canada Rising interest rates and weak commodity prices combined to push stock prices sharply lower in Toronto. The TSE 300 composite index closed 94.4 down at 4,393.6, while losing issues far outpaced rises by 740 to 169. Trading volume was 73.2m shares valued at CDollars 812.7m. All of the sub-indices weakened. Industrial products, consumer products, financial services and golds each lost more than 2 per cent. The energy group was down 1.8 per cent. Mexico Equities opened lower on news of a rise in interest rates, before rallying at midday on rumours, later confirmed, that the ruling party had chosen Mr Ernesto Zedillo as presidential candidate following last week's assassination of Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio. The IPC index gained a net 11.44 at 2,457.59.</p>

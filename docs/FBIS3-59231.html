			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO     In an article in the 18 January Paris daily LIBERATION,  Robert de Bruin, communications director for the French Banking  Association, protests the damaging comments that greeted the  Greek EC presidency and influenced West European political  leaders, leading to the official recognition of the Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM]. True, Greeks are "often  disconcerting" and have lacked "the gift of communication" on  the Macedonian issue, de Bruin admits. Also, European  "ambiguity" vis-a-vis modern Greece must be acknowledged.  However, the Greek presidency ought to be seen as a "chance" for  Europe, he argues. An Orthodox and Balkan country will preside  over Europe at a time when the continent's political future will  be defined by the relationship between the European Union [EU]  and Orthodox Russia, as well as by the "boiling Balkan  cauldron." To disregard Greece's opinion on Macedonia or contest  its capability to lead the EU would be as ridiculous as deciding  the future of Europe by "disregarding the Franco-German axis,"  de Bruin contends. Furthermore, a European Greece is an economic  "chance" as well, he continues. While the press only speaks of a  "lost economy" propped up by EC subsidies, a drachma zone is  beginning to take shape in the Balkans; and even if the Greek  currency is not very strong, Greece possesses a stable currency  in the eyes of Romanians, Bulgarians, and Albanians. Finally, if  it is "shameful" to take advantage of Brussels' subsidies,  perhaps the European presidency ought to be denied to Ireland or  Portugal, de Bruin comments. "Let us listen to Greece, for we  have been lucky enough to have had as a European partner an  Orthodox, Balkan Greece endowed with a per capita economic  potential equal to Italy's," he concludes.</p>

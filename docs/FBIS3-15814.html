I think the meeting with  Russian President Boris Yeltsin which has just taken place has  set a clear-cut friendly tone in relations and cooperation  between Russia and Italy," Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyev said today at his meeting with Italian Minister of  Foreign Affairs Beniamino Andreatta.    Kozyrev greeted the Italian minister also as a  representative  of the Group of Seven industrialised countries and president of  the Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Kozyrev  stressed that time was ripe for turning the seven into eight, at  least in the political sphere. "It is difficult to imagine a  situation where any important political problems could be now  resolved without Russia's participation," Kozyrev said.</p>

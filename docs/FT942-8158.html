			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Only the best will do - Gillian O'Connor looks at a trust-picker with teeth Investors in the US wanting to have their money managed by the legendary Warren Buffett used to have two choices. First, they could try to get hold of shares in Berkshire Hathaway, the company he runs. Or they could buy into Sequoia, a fund with a similar approach and a hefty chunk of Berkshire Hathaway shares in its portfolio. Sadly, Sequoia has been closed to new investors. British investors can play a similar game with unit trusts recommended by Fund Research. London is teeming with stockbrokers' analysts researching individual companies. But only Fund Research makes an equally serious bid to pick the best of the 1,500-odd unit trusts on the market. Run by former fund managers, the firm screens the funds exhaustively in order to winnow out all but the minority which perform well on a consistent basis. It does not use the normal one, three, five and 10 year performance tables to select past 'winners'; instead, it looks at each fund over discrete periods of a year within a longer time span. Only those which are among the leaders qualify consistently for the second round. Next, it goes through its short-list with a fine-toothed comb, looking for such potential problems as excessively high turnover. Then, it grills the fund managers. The myth is that Fund Research interviewers always go in pairs, with a different duo each time in order to minimise the chances of human misjudgment. ('Not quite true,' says managing director Peter Jeffrey). But if a fund manager leaves, the new one must endure further close questioning. The qualitative judgment counts most in the final assessment. The research is sold to investment managers for up to Pounds 8,750 a year. As yet, no version of Fund Research's work is available to the UK public although, in the US, comparable firms such as Morningstar and Value Line sell their findings to the affluent private investor. But there are two ways in which British private investors can hitch a ride on the bandwagon. They can either buy units in a trust called Portfolio Fund of Funds, which has produced very good results by following Fund Research's recommendations closely; or they can buy the same unit trusts as Portfolio does. Portfolio was started, and is managed, by the one of the men who started Fund Research: Richard Timberlake, former managing director of Fidelity UK. In the four years to the beginning of 1994, its units had risen by 82 per cent compared with 61 per cent for the FT-SE-A All-Share index and 24 per cent for the Morgan Stanley Capital International world index. And, in the second half of 1993, the units rose by 29 per cent compared with 19 per cent for the FT-SE-A All Share. The managers point out that, over the same four-year period, their fund did better than any of the other 20 funds of funds - that is, unit trusts which invest in other trusts rather than directly in shares. The average return on a Pounds 100 investment was Pounds 135 compared with Pounds 178 from Portfolio. Timberlake and his associates are notorious for driving a hard bargain on charges with the managers of the funds in which they invest. The initial charge on their fund is 5 per cent for investments up to Pounds 4,999, with lower rates on larger sums. The annual charge is 1 per cent and the minimum investment Pounds 1,000. As yet, Portfolio Fund of Funds is a minnow, worth only Pounds 2.5m with some 150 unit-holders. But the managers are planning to produce an emerging markets fund run on the same principles.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                          FROM THE HORSE'S MOUTH  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Portfolio's Choice                                             %  --------------------------------------------------------------------- United Kingdom Credit Suisse Smaller Companies                               7.2 Fidelity Special Situations                                   9.5 Lazard UK Smaller Companies Growth                            7.0 Rothschild Five Arrows Smaller UK Companies                   4.4 Capability Income &amp; Growth                                    2.1 Newton Income                                                 5.7 Schroder UK Enterprise                                        5.0 Total                                                        40.9  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Europe Baillie Gifford Europe                                        4.6 Fidelity European                                             9.2 Lazard European Growth                                        3.8 Morgan Grenfell European Growth                               5.4 Total                                                        23.0  --------------------------------------------------------------------- South East Asia &amp; Pacific Gartmore Hong Kong                                            7.2 GT Far East &amp; General                                         3.1 Schroder Far Eastern Growth                                   7.0 Schroder Tokyo                                                5.0  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Emerging Markets City of London Emerging Markets                               5.1  --------------------------------------------------------------------- USA HYPO F&amp;C US Smaller Companies                                 2.0 Perpetual American Growth                                     2.2 Total                                                         4.2  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Overseas Bonds Guinness Flight Global High Income Bond Trust                                        3.5  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Cash                                                          1.0                                                              100%  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Portfolio Fund Management Ltd  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

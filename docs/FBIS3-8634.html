			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Bisera Turkovic, the Republic of </F> Bosnia-Herzegovina's ambassador to Croatia, by Milan Jelovac;  place and date not given: "The Serbs Will Also Accept the  Federation"]    [Text] Mrs. Bisera Turkovic is the ambassador of  Bosnia-Herzegovina to Croatia, a country which, according to the  Washington agreement, could soon form a confederation with the  Republic of Croatia. On this occasion, we asked her to comment  on the documents signed in Washington.    [Turkovic] They were preliminary agreements on forming a  federal Bosnia-Herzegovina and a confederal union of the two  sovereign states, the Republic of Croatia and the federation of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. The agreement involves calming down the war  in Bosnia-Herzegovina and not only that: It might eliminate the  danger of the definitive collapse of the state of  Bosnia-Herzegovina and of creating a precedent that would then  definitely also be applied to the Republic of Croatia.    [Jelovac] You, therefore, think that signatures of the  Croatian and Muslim representatives in Washington saved the  state of Bosnia-Herzegovina?    [Turkovic] They saved Bosnia-Herzegovina for sure, but  partly also Croatia, considering what could happen after a  possible division of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    [Jelovac] What kind of state will it be? What about the  Serbs, who are a constituent nation in Bosnia-Herzegovina?    [Turkovic] Bosnia-Herzegovina should be organized as a  federation, composed of cantons that would be constituted  according to the majority nation, whether Croatian or Bosniak.  Naturally, the concept of federation, i.e., of cantonization,  is open and offered to the Serbs as well.    [Jelovac] With regard to the great interest in central  Bosnia, can you tell us which central Bosnian towns will be  included in the Croatian canton?    [Turkovic] Details of that agreement, primarily the borders,  the exact areas of demarcation, will be determined on the basis  of an appendix to the agreement. Working groups are supposed to  determine that in Vienna in 11 days. We will then know the  answer to many questions, all the details on the demarcation of  the cantons and their number. After that, on 15 March,  President Tudjman and President Izetbegovic are to sign the  final agreement on the federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and  the agreement on the confederation of Bosnia-Herzegovina and  Croatia.    [Jelovac] The possible confederation foresees a common  currency and borders, and the free flow of people and capital.  Will there be a border between Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina,  and will there be customs?    [Turkovic] As this will be a customs union, there will be no  mutual customs duties. The agreement on confederation would  have another two additional agreements that are not proposed in  their preliminary form. One of them is the agreement on the  free flow of goods through the federation, that is, without  customs and inspections on the territory of the federation.  That solves a very topical problem for Croatia, which is, in a  way, divided by Neum. All citizens of the federation will be  granted free access to the Republic of Croatia and free use of  roads, railroads, and airline routes. Therefore, the agreement  allows better communications, which would be very stimulating  for economic relations and it would revitalize the economy and  tourism, not to mention the stability of the region.    [Jelovac] Still, one cannot deny that Bosnia-Herzegovina was  not very developed in former Yugoslavia and that it constantly  had to be financially supported. Who will finance it now?    [Turkovic] Many indicators which were manipulated before  cannot indicate the real situation. Bosnia-Herzegovina can  surely finance itself, it can even finance a much wider  territory. In view of its potential, its mineral resources, and  its great concentration of industry, it has no problems in  financing itself. Furthermore, Bosnia-Herzegovina also has the  chance to get substantial finances from Western European  countries, the United States, emigrees, and the Arab countries.  This eastern source was very much exploited in the former  system, but it was not widely publicized.    [Jelovac] Do you see the future federation as a democratic  state since Clinton has announced that he will support the  existence of Bosnia-Herzegovina even with military force.    [Turkovic] That is a matter of scale and the legality of  application of the penal system. If it is used to preserve  democracy, then it is very much needed. President Clinton spoke  to that effect. In order to preserve peace and protect human  rights, which was emphasized in the preliminary agreement, even  repressive measures might be taken in Bosnia-Herzegovina, if  necessary. All that to preserve what people at this moment very  much need--freedom, full democracy, and human rights.    [Jelovac] If the U.S. initiative forces Croatia to  compromise, that is, to accept confederation with  Bosnia-Herzegovina, does that mean that Alija Izetbegovic  relinquishes the concept of a unitary Bosnia-Herzegovina?    [Turkovic] All solutions, especially those in military  conflicts, are compromises. Therefore, this solution is  somewhere between the interests of the two sides. It is  necessary to compromise in order to have peace, normalize  relations, and save human lives, which should be our first goal.  The U.S. formula is ideal: It enables the preservation of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, very substantial rights, and the national  identities in this case of two nations, and it also gives a  chance to the third one within the framework of the proposed  federation.    [Jelovac] How do you interpret the return of Russia to the  Balkans, and especially to Bosnia-Herzegovina, in view of the  open support that it is giving to the Bosnian Serbs?    [Turkovic] It is no secret, it is quite clear and quite  logical. However, the support can be interpreted in different  ways. Someone's patronage can be directed in a positive sense,  toward bringing people to their senses. It can also be in a  negative context, in the sense of creating irrational illusions  about domination and power. At this moment, we see the role of  Russia as positive. Russia is obviously having a realistic and  rational influence on the Serbs, who probably had illusions  about much greater protection, which would unquestioningly  protect everything Serbian regardless of reality and the  irrationality of the demands. The latest meeting between  Karadzic and Kosyrev, which resulted in the Serbs agreeing to  reopen Tuzla airport, proves that. So does Karadzic's  acceptance of the federation between the Bosniaks and the Croats  in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and also his openness to finding ways for  the Serbs to accept the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation as well.  That will not be easy but we must begin somewhere.    [Jelovac] The first reactions of the Bosnian Serbs to the  Washington agreement called it "an internal matter between the  Croats and the Muslims." Judging from the statements of Western  officials who do not directly mention the Serbs, the third  constituent nation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, one gets the  impression that the Serbs are even being given the possibility  to leave Bosnia- Herzegovina and join the FRY [Federal Republic  of Yugoslavia]. Anyway, Karadzic's main political goal is the  unification "of all Serbian lands." What will happen to the  Serbs, will they stay in Bosnia-Herzegovina or will they leave?    [Turkovic] At this moment, there are different  interpretations of the situation. There are external elements  that must not be neglected, for they can be crucial. It would  be naive to believe that the destiny of the Balkans and  Bosnia-Herzegovina exclusively depends upon their inhabitants.  There are, of course, much wider strategic interests that have  always determined the outcome of conflicts in these parts.    [Jelovac] You think that, therefore, the state of Bosnia-  Herzegovina will not be able to prevent the possible decision by  the Bosnian Serbs to join their native Serbia, if they are not  stopped by the appropriate international factors?    [Turkovic] If these international factors were in favor of  the division of Bosnia-Herzegovina, then such agreements would  not be signed. But, even if the international community were  intent on dividing Bosnia-Herzegovina, it is questionable  whether this could be done. In this case, the situation is just  the opposite: We have the very firm stance of the international  community and the United States to preserve Bosnia-Herzegovina  as an integral country, territorially speaking. That is a  factor that the Serbs, too, will have to face and accept the  solution. Naturally, not a solution necessarily at their  expense, but a solution that is a compromise and departure from  their absolute demands. The Serbs will have to come to terms  with that.    [Jelovac] If the Serbs stay in Bosnia-Herzegovina, what  will their relationship be with the Croat-Bosniak federation and  the confederation of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina? What will  their relations be with their native Serbia? Would it not be a  restoration of Yugoslavia, with only the Macedonians and the  Slovenes missing?    [Turkovic] I would not like to attempt to solve this issue  now; we must first see the final shape of the agreement on  creating the federation and confederation. There will surely be  a role for the Serbs as well, respecting their identity, of  course. They will then be proposed a role.    [Jelovac] You recently appeared on Croatian Television and,  speaking about the ethnic Serbs, you stated: "We will see to  what extent the Serbs will remain in Bosnia-Herzegovina." What  does that mean, does it mean the Serbs will leave, and where  will they go and what will they take along? Bundles or the  territory they hold?    [Turkovic] You know, all those who cannot fit into a certain  framework usually leave certain areas and go somewhere else.  With regard to the Serbs, we must say that, unfortunately, a  large number of them have blood on their hands as they have  committed terrible crimes. Those people, even if there were  forgiven, and we should not forgive anyone, will surely not stay  where they lived before. They will go somewhere. But many who  were misled will stay, for we cannot and must not blame the  entire nation for crimes committed by a gang of terrorists that  received support from a sizable part of their nation. That is  the reality.    [Jelovac] Which part of the Bosnia-Herzegovina territory  would you give to the Serbs to be annexed to Serbia?    [Turkovic] Not a single part.    [Jelovac] How do you imagine that 70 percent of the  territory will be given back? Through diplomacy and  negotiations or through the war option, together with the Croats  when they and the Serbs normalize relations?    [Turkovic] Greater Serbia is not created only in Belgrade.  It does not depend on the Serbs alone. The creation of greater  Serbia also largely depends on both the Croats and the Bosniaks.  If Croatia agrees to negotiate to divide Bosnia-Herzegovina  with the Serbs, then it is creating greater Serbia at the same  time. Not only at the expense of Bosnia-Herzegovina, but also  at its own. With the unity of the two nations in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and with the support of neighboring Croatia,  the cause of the problem is slowly coming to the surface. When  you have a clearly identified enemy and perpetrator of the  aggression, then it is easy to apply punishment and get support  for the punishment.    [Jelovac] By military means?    [Turkovic] We will see about that. It is not only up to us  to use those means.</p>

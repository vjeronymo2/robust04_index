			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Performance pay's value questioned THE value of performance-related pay to employers and employees has been called into question by a poll of 1,600 British Telecom managers. The survey, conducted by the Society of Telecom Executives, found that only 7 per cent thought PRP schemes improved their performance. Some 66 per cent thought that performance pay was applied unfairly, and more than 70 per cent thought that bonuses were arbitrary and undermined teamwork.</p>

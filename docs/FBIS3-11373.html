			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Marcelo Bonelli; all names as published] </F>   [Text] Bill Clinton's Democratic administration is studying  the demands submitted by 30 U.S. businesses asking for the  immediate application of trade sanctions against Argentine  manufacturers that export to the U.S. market.    The initiative is being evaluated by the U.S. trade  representative, the influential and incisive Michael Kantor, who  less than a week ago had a harsh and unusual conversation with  President Carlos Menem.    The U.S. official is studying possible sanctions at the  request of the powerful U.S. pharmaceutical industry due to the  approval of the patents law here.    The demand presumably implies (if it succeeds) the setting  of  quotas, the elimination of preferential import systems, and  tariffs for several Argentine manufactured goods that might  include textiles, steel products, petrochemicals, and leather  products.    The U.S. trade representative is precisely studying whether  to term Argentina "a priority foreign country."    This in fact means the following: The Democratic  administration's Commerce Department is beginning its evaluation  to immediately apply every type of trade reprisal.    The request is contained in a confidential document CLARIN  had exclusive access to. In the document, influential U.S.  business people ask that Argentina be qualified an "offensive"  nation on the question of trade because they believe Argentina  is "resisting" the implementation of an adequate policy in the  intellectual property field. Adequate, of course, for U.S.  industry interests.    The two demands are really contradictory. Bilateral trade is  frankly negative for Argentina. The deficit amounted to $2.4  billion in 1993.    Despite all of this, the U.S. corporation known as the  Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association [title in English]  (PMA), which was created to lobby [preceding word in English]  for the powerful multinational laboratories, demands sanctions.    These are the words that are used in that secret paper  [preceding word in English]: "In sum, we believe that the  following four countries are so offensive in their practices,  policies, and actions, and that they continue to resist efforts  to improve their respective intellectual property measures that  they do not merit being named as foreign priority countries:  Argentina, Brazil, India, and Turkey."    The pharmaceutical industry of the north does not stop  there,  and it suggests the implementation of Resolution No. 301 with  which the United States threatened Japan in the trade war  declaration.    The letter is only signed by Gerald Mossinghoff, who holds  the post of PMA head. It is exactly two pages long. A copy of  the document is to be found in the U.S. Embassy in Buenos Aires.    This is not a secret to the government. CLARIN also has been  able to detect the presence here of three PMA representatives.    They have been here since 15 March. They have contacted top  members of the Senate and Chamber of Deputies. Between today  and 17 March they will hold meetings at the Foreign and Economy  Ministries.    They are three PMA heavyweights -- Warren Wells, vice  president for Latin America, and directors Lesly Ackerman and  Bruce McPhil.    These businessmen also are demanding a total ban against  Argentina's access to the common market formed by the United  States, Canada, and Mexico.    The document states precisely: "Other Latin American  countries have expressed their wish for access to NAFTA. The  PMA believes that even before negotiations for this access  begins, the U.S. trade representative must be sure that the  region's national laws on patents must comply with NAFTA's  standards regarding intellectual property."    In this case Argentina will remain out of NAFTA. Or, at  least it will not figure in the first list of countries that  Clinton will make known in May.    The PMA groups 30 large multinational enterprises. It  invoices $70 billion a year, which is the exact equivalent of  one-third of Argentina's GDP.    On 11 March, Kantor himself, in a surprise move, told Menem  that Argentina must approve a new law on pharmaceutical patents  within 45 days. Government House insists that Kantor's attitude  and language were a discourtesy toward Menem.    And they really do not know what to do. They are willing to  negotiate. Argentina wants something conclusive in exchange,  but there are doubts whether it will be possible.</p>

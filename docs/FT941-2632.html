			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / International Company News: Commerzbank reveals 3% holding in floated BCI David Waller in Frankfurt and John Simkins in Milan Commerzbank, the smallest of Germany's big three private-sector commercial banks, said yesterday it had bought a 3 per cent stake in Banca Commerciale Italiana, the newly-privatised Italian bank. The German institution said it had recently been asked by BCI to take a shareholding, which it bought on the stock market at an undisclosed price. The move comes amid growing belief that institutions close to Mediobanca, the Milan-based merchant bank, have accumulated a combined holding of up to 20 per cent in BCI, which ranks among the top six Italian banks in terms of assets. Such a stake would give the group a powerful argument for a seat on the board. Commerzbank, which recently formed commercial links with another privatised bank, Credito Italiano, said the BCI stake was a strategic move to intensify operations in Italy. Besides Commerzbank, the other two institutions with declared holdings close to 3 per cent, the maximum voting power of any one shareholder, are Paribas, and Generali, Italy's largest insurance company. BCI, which is a Paribas shareholder, has 8 per cent of Mediobanca, which is a major shareholder in Generali. The pattern of ownership will not become apparent, however, until the bank holds its first shareholders' meeting as a public company. This is expected by the end of April. The jockeying for position within the bank has pitted the Mediobanca allies against Mr Romano Prodi, chairman of the state holding company IRI, which disposed of its entire 54 per cent stake in BCI through a public offer and a private placement. Mr Prodi's wishes for a wide spread of ownership resulted in a clawback in favour of private investors. There were also complaints from Italian unit trusts that the allocation had not favoured them, suggesting a considerable placement with foreign investors, out of Mediobanca's reach.</p>

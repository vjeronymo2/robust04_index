			<p>920702 FT  02 JUL 92 / Leading Article: Credibility test for Bonn WHEN GERMANY was reunited in October 1990, its friends and allies hoped that Europe's pivotal nation would meet its new challenges and responsibilities in a way which would maintain its credibility as a reliable partner of the west. That credibility has now been sorely strained by the decision, confirmed by the Bonn cabinet yesterday, not to go ahead with production of the European Fighter Aircraft (EFA) developed at a cost of Pounds 8bn with Britain, Italy and Spain. The Bonn government is under strong pressure to take high-profile action to reduce its budget deficit. Additionally, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's administration has to show that it can successfully draw up post-unification priorities. For Bonn's political leadership, these twin aims pose a great test; beating a retreat from the EFA production hangar is, unfortunately, the wrong way to accomplish them. On financial, industrial and strategic grounds, the decision appears to be misguided, for three reasons. The step may end up wasting more money than it saves. It risks considerable disruption and uncertainty in a highly important sector - the aerospace industry - which the German government has done its best to restructure and make competitive under the aegis of Daimler-Benz. Finally, the move fails to answer the question of how Germany will secure its air defences over the medium term in a world which, despite the ending of the Cold War, will not remain threat-free. Cheaper aircraft The German government has left open the possibility of negotiating with its partners on a cheaper and lighter aircraft, still to be modelled on the EFA. But there is only the slimmest of hopes that this can be accomplished on a satisfactory basis. Rather than keeping other governments, air forces and aerospace companies guessing, the Germans now have a duty to tell their EFA partners exactly how they intend to acquire their next generation of combat aircraft, and with which other countries - if any - they propose to co-operate in fulfilling that need. A continuation of Bonn's present ambiguity would provide the worst possible framework for industrial planning. It would also buttress the suspicion, already raised by Bonn's dilatoriness in areas like the Gatt talks, that indecisiveness has become an endemic part of German policy-making. Fresh collaboration Mr Volker Ruhe, the defence minister, has indicated that other countries outside the EFA quartet might be invited to join in fresh collaboration. For political reasons, Mr Kohl would have strong motives in extending an entry card to France, which is pursuing development of its smaller Rafale fighter, designed for ground attack and naval operations rather than air defence. Certainly, if France, Germany and Britain had decided to co-operate on a new-generation combat aircraft in 1985, rather than going their separate paths, the industry would be in a better position to surmount the present problems. A German attempt to reopen aeronautic fiancailles across the Rhine might however have a highly debatable outcome. The French would have to abandon the already-troubled Rafale project and start again on a new aircraft - without any assurance that it would not end, like the EFA, in tears. In reacting to the EFA imbroglio, Germany's partners must consider a range of difficult options. German withdrawal from the production phase need not totally undermine the economics of the project. But it may damage the aerospace industry's claim that the EFA is cheaper than any other comparable performance alternative - including off-the-shelf aircraft from the US. A thoroughgoing attack on costs, involving cheaper avionics and weapons systems, as well as streamlining production and assembly work, will be necessary in any event. Draconian cost cutting would indeed be needed to regain German participation, as the German aerospace industry hopes, at a later stage. The chances of tempting the Germans back into the EFA fold may be extremely slight, but they should not be completely abandoned. If, on the other hand, the nein turns out to be definite, Germany will have to realise that ending this particular alliance will have political as well as industrial consequences.</p>

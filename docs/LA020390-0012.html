			<p><P> February 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLICE RELATIONS  </P> <P> Regarding Michael Wilmington's Jan. 12 review of "Internal Affairs":  </P> <P> I wonder if a more sensitive reviewer or a more aware (daring?) movie maker  would have questioned the screenwriter's gratuitous use of a "lesbian partner"  as a police officer.  </P> <P> I can almost picture the studio conferences over this issue:  </P> <P> "Let's have a woman partner -- that's 'in.' "  </P> <P> "OK, but we can't have another love interest subplot -- let's make her a  lesbian, that's sexually safe and 'in'!"  </P> <P> And did even one rational voice suggest that maybe a good-looking heterosexual  man and an attractive heterosexual woman can work together, professionally and  respectfully , without "doing it"? Oh, no, that's dull city, eh, guys?  </P> <P> PHYLLIS MAGILL LEVY, Mission Hills  </P></p>

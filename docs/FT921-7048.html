			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / International Company News: Search for successor to Iacocca takes new twist THE SEARCH for a successor to Mr Lee Iacocca as chairman of Chrysler took an unexpected twist yesterday when Mr Steve Miller, vice-chairman and one of several candidates for the top job, announced he was leaving the automobile company. Mr Miller, 50, is to join the small but distinguished New York investment bank of James D. Wolfensohn as a senior partner. The firm's other seven partners include the eponymous Mr Wolfensohn and Mr Paul Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve. Mr Iacocca, who is to retire at the end of 1992, said Mr Miller was one of several candidates under consideration for his job. However, industry analysts had not viewed Mr Miller as a particular favourite for the post since his expertise is mainly on the financial side, rather than in making cars. The other main internal candidate is thought to be Mr Robert Lutz, the president of the company and head of its automobile manufacturing operations, although there have been reports of friction between him and Mr Iacocca. This has led to speculation that the company may look outside for a successor, perhaps considering Mr Gerald Greenwald, who was favourite to succeed Mr Iacocca before leaving Chrysler in 1990. He is now a managing director of Dillon, Read, the Wall Street investment bank. Mr Miller became chief financial officer of Chrysler in 1981 - in the midst of its brush with bankruptcy - and worked with Mr Wolfensohn and Mr Volcker during the company's financial restructuring. He said yesterday: 'It was not an easy decision to leave Chrysler. But the essential work to position the company for the 1990s has been completed: a new array of products, a lean cost structure, and a revitalised balance sheet. I felt it was time for a new challenge.' Chrysler, like other car manufacturers, has been facing a severe financial squeeze because of the US recession and is banking on new product introductions later this year to solidify its market share. It has yet to name a replacement for Mr Miller.</p>

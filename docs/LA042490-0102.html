			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRUSTEE SAYS BUYERS ARE INTERESTED IN EASTERN;  </P> <P> AIRLINES: MARTIN SHUGRUE FIRES THE CARRIER'S CHIEF LABOR NEGOTIATOR, EXTENDING  AN OLIVE BRANCH TO UNIONS.  </P> <P> The trustee appointed last week by a bankruptcy court judge to take charge of  troubled Eastern Airlines said Monday that there have been "expressions of  interest from a number of parties" about buying the airline.  </P> <P> Martin R. Shugrue Jr. vowed that Eastern will not be cut up and disposed of in  pieces but did not rule out a sale of the airline as a whole. "This trustee is  not a liquidator," he added forcefully. "I came here to stem the financial  losses and make Eastern economically viable."  </P> <P> But he conceded that the airline's financial situation will have to be  radically improved before any serious offers can be expected. He declined to  identify any of those who have "shown interest in this enterprise."  </P> <P> Shugrue, in his first public appearance since his appointment by U.S.  Bankruptcy Court Judge Burton R. Lifland in New York last Wednesday night, also  struck a conciliatory note toward Eastern's labor unions. He said a dialogue  must be established immediately with the machinists, who have been on strike  for more than a year and whose walkout triggered the airline's bankruptcy  filing. He said preliminary talks have already taken place.  </P> <P> He said there has been "a lot of blood spilled" in Eastern's dealings with  labor and urged that any talks with the unions be conducted "on a less  hysterical plane."  </P> <P> "My immediate agenda calls for toning down the noise and rhetoric which have  undermined the confidence of our passengers and shippers," he said. "We need a  period of normalcy during which Eastern can stay off the front pages and  evening newscasts. I'd certainly like to harmonize labor relations."  </P> <P> Clearly extending an olive branch to the unions, Shugrue said one of his first  official acts had been to fire Thomas Matthews, Eastern's senior vice president  for human resources and the airline's chief labor negotiator.  </P> <P> But Shugrue also vowed that Eastern would not become a patsy to the unions.  "Talking with the unions by no means implies a simple caving-in to their  demands," he said.  </P> <P> He said there is no "artificially imposed deadline from the judge or the  creditors' committee" on a timetable for a turnaround, the filing of a new  reorganization plan or the airline's emergence from bankruptcy. In answer to a  question, he said the size of his compensation as trustee had not yet been  determined.  </P> <P> The trustee was once vice chairman of Pan Am Corp. and is a former president of  Continental Airlines, which, along with Eastern, is owned by Texas Air Corp. of  Houston. He appeared confident during the 45-minute news conference at  Eastern's Miami headquarters that he will be able to bring the airline back to  life.  </P> <P> "I believe Eastern can achieve a financial turnaround," he said. "I believe  Eastern has basic strengths which can be revitalized. I believe Eastern can be  a profitable airline."  </P> <P> The 49-year-old former naval aviator said his "immediate priorities are to  increase revenues and re-establish consumer confidence." He added that the  airline will soon initiate an aggressive marketing campaign designed to lure  business travelers. At the same time, he said, the airline would not abandon  its discount fares for leisure travel.  </P></p>

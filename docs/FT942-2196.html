			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Canada to reform rules on VAT Canada's Goods and Services Tax (GST), the value-added levy introduced in the face of a public uproar three years ago, will undergo several changes if the government accepts a report due to be tabled late yesterday. However, the suggested reforms fall far short of promises by the now-ruling Liberal party during last year's election campaign to scrap the controversial tax. The House of Commons finance committee was asked to draw up alternatives to the GST shortly after the Liberals took office last November. Among its main recommendations, according to leaked versions of the report, is a proposal that the tax be made less visible by including it in the retail price of goods and services, rather than adding it at the cash register. The committee has also reportedly urged that the tax be broadened to include groceries and prescription medicines. In this way, the rate could be reduced from the present 7 per cent to about 5.3 per cent. The most politically sensitive part of the report is likely to be a proposal that the federal tax be harmonised with retail sales taxes levied by nine of Canada's 10 provinces. With the exception of Quebec, the provinces have so far resisted Ottawa's efforts to roll their taxes, which vary from 7 per cent to 12 per cent, into the GST. The GST was introduced by the former Progressive Conservative government to replace a manufacturers' sales tax, and accelerate a shift from direct to indirect taxation. Although widely welcomed by business, the new tax became a rallying point for Tory opponents.</p>

			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SCHOOL BOARD TO GET PROM GUIDELINES  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Board of Education is expected to vote Monday on a proposal  from district students that is designed to increase participation in senior  proms and reduce their cost.  </P> <P> A committee of students this week presented the board with a series of  recommendations, including a proposal that students sign a code of conduct  promising to stay off drugs and alcohol on prom night.  </P> <P> The board will vote on the guidelines, which were drafted at the urging of  board member Roberta Weintraub, at Monday's board meeting.  </P> <P> Included are suggestions encouraging students to open interest-bearing savings  accounts to save the money for prom-related expenses which, according to an  informal district survey, averaged $900 per couple last year. Another proposal  asked the board to revise rules to allow senior classes to apply up to 50% of  the profits from class fund-raisers to defray prom costs.  </P></p>

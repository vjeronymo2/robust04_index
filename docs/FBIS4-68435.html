			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Valeriy Galitskiy, Aris Zakharov, and Aleksandr </F> Frenkel, Russian State Committee on Statistics: "Production  Output and Price Dynamics as of 5 April"]    [Text]  <H5>  Prices for Consumer Goods and Services </H5>   Over the period 29 March to 5 April 1994 prices for consumer  goods and services rose by 2.2 percent, including for  foodstuffs--by 1.4 percent, nonfood items--by 1.9 percent,  and for-fee services for the population--by 11.9 percent.  The highest rate of increases in prices for goods was registered  in cities of the East Siberian economic region, and for for-fee  services for the population--in the cities of Northwestern, West  Siberian, and Far Eastern regions.    Indices of prices for consumer goods and services in the  consumer market were as follows (as a percentage of the  preceding observation date):                     03/22       03/29       04/05       Average daily price                                                       rise                                                        April       March   Consumer goods   102.1       101.8       102.2       0.31        0.27  and services   including:   foodstuffs       101.4       101.2       101.4       0.20        0.20   nonfood items    102.8       102.6       101.9       0.29        0.34   for-fee          103.5       101.6       111.9       1.62        0.45  services for  the population     <H5>  Foodstuffs. </H5>   Over the period 29 March to 5 April prices in organized and  nonorganized trade rose by 1.5 percent and 1.3 percent.    Price changes by main categories of food products are shown  below (as a percentage of the preceding observation date):                         Total           Including:                                        in organized        in nonorganized                                       trade               trade   All food products    101.4           101.5               101.3   including:   Meat and meat        100.9           100.7               101.4  products   Fish and fish        101.7           101.7               98.7  products   Milk and milk        102.2           102.9               97.2  products   Eggs                 100.2           100.4               98.7   Sugar                99.8            99.8                100.0   Bread and bakery     105.8           105.8  products   Cereals and          103.4           103.4               102.4  macaroni items   Vodka                99.5            99.5                98.8   Potatoes and         104.8           106.1               103.5  vegetables      In organized trade, similar to the preceding  month, vegetable prices rose at an anticipatory rate: onions--by  14 percent, fresh cabbage--by 11 percent, and carrots--by 7  percent. A high rate of price increases remained with respect to  bread and bakery products (5-7.5 percent). A higher rate of  price increases than in March was registered with respect to  milk products (2.7-5 percent). There was practically no change  over the week in prices for meat, butter, vegetable oil, sugar,  eggs, and vodka.    Similar to organized trade, the greatest price increases  in nonorganized trade were registered with respect to  fresh produce: prices for onions went up by 11 percent, fresh  cabbage--by 6 percent, and garlic--by 5 percent. The rate of  prices rises with respect to meat increased somewhat as compared  to March (1.4 percent). Prices for milk products remained  practically unchanged.    The cost of the consumer basket of 19 basic  foodstuffs increased over the week by 2.7 percent and as of  5 April amounted to 45,500 rubles [R], calculated on a monthly  basis. The price differential between monitored cities measured  a factor of 4.0; the highest cost was registered in Magadan  (R122,400) and the lowest--in Ulyanovsk (R27,800). In terms of  the cost of the consumer basket, St. Petersburg and Moscow  ranked 33th and 37th among 132 monitored cities (R49,700 and  R49,100 on a monthly basis).  <H5>  Nonfood Items </H5>   As in March, prices for nonfood items rose at a somewhat  higher rate. Prices for some medicines continued to rise at a  high rate--10 percent. Prices for garments, knitwear, and  footwear rose over the week by 1.7-2 percent.  <H5>  For-Fee Services for the Population </H5>   At the beginning of April rates of for-fee services for the  population increased considerably. Apartment rents in Russia on  average rose 23.9 percent; the cost of urban and rail  transportation--15-19 percent, and that of basic residential  telephone service--12-17 percent.    Rents in municipally owned residential buildings in St.  Petersburg, Vladimir, Saransk, Kurgan, Blagoveshchensk, and  cities in Tatarstan increased several-fold. In Surgut they  jumped from R100 to R255 per square meter. The cost of municipal  services also went up considerably in these cities.    Urban bus fares in Belgorod, Maykop, Khabarovsk,  Komsomolsk-na-Amure, and Samara increased by a factor of 2.5 to  five; rail transportation fares in Orel, Yaroslavl, Saransk,  Rostov-na-Donu, and Stavropol--by a factor of two to 2.5.    While fees for attending preschool facilities increased in  Russia as a whole on average by 13.8 percent over the week, in  Tyumen, Surgut, and Maykop they increased more than twofold, and  in Voronezh--fourfold.  <H5>  Wholesale Prices for Industrial Products </H5>   The index of wholesale prices for industrial  products was lower in March than in February, and measured  110 percent. Over three months of this year (as compared to  December 1993) prices increased 1.5-fold.    In practically all industrial sectors (with the exception of  electric power generation, nonferrous metallurgy, and chemistry)  prices rose at a slower pace than in February of this year.  Prices rose slower with respect to fuel industry products. Oil  prices increased over the month by 15 percent, petroleum  products--by 6 percent, and coal--by 8 percent. At the end of  March the average price of coal in the main coal-producing  regions--Kemerovo and Rostov Oblasts--amounted to R16,000-18,000  per tonne, and in Republic of Komi--R22,000 per tonne; oil in  Tyumen Oblast--R65,000. Producer wholesale price of gas amounted  to R5,400 per 1,000 cubic meters, gasoline--R148,000, and diesel  fuel--R136,000 per tonne. Overall over the first quarter, fuel  industry wholesale prices increased 1.7-fold.    Higher prices for fuel and products of their processing  continued to affect the cost of electric power. By the end of  the quarter electric power rates as compared to December 1993  increased 1.6-fold and amounted on average for all categories of  consumers to about R29 per kw-hour. The main increases in  electric power rates in March occurred with respect to electric  power delivered to industrial consumers and municipal  services--by more than 20 percent.    As during the preceding two months, wholesale prices for  consumer goods rose at a slower rate than those for producer  goods, and amounted on average to 9 percent. Wholesale prices of  milk and meat products increased over the month by 7-9 percent.  Over the quarter, prices in bread-baking, butter-making,  cheese-making, and milk industry rose by a factor of 1.5-1.6.    Freight rates at all types of transportation increased by 8  percent in March of this year, including by rail--by 21 percent,  pipeline--by 11.5 percent, and automotive--by 7.5 percent. Air  freight rates remained practically unchanged.    As compared to December 1993, freight rates increased  1.8-fold, including rail transport--by 79 percent, pipeline--by  75 percent, and automotive--by 73 percent.  <H5>  Industry </H5>   In the first quarter of this year Russian industry produced  R55 trillion worth of goods in current prices, including in  March--R21 trillion worth. The physical volume of  production declined by 24.9 percent as compared to the  first quarter of last year (in the first quarter of 1993  production declined as compared to the analogous period of 1992  by 19.3 percent), including by 23.1 percent in January, 24.1  percent in February, and 27.4 percent in March.    During the first quarter it became clear that the production  decline is predominantly of a structural nature. This manifested  itself in the fact that the volume of production became  increasingly predicated more on solvent demand than on resource  potential. As a result, the degree of any particular sector's  reaction to the emerging market situation varied. While gas  production remained practically at last year's level, sectors in  the fuel and energy complex reduced production of oil and coal  by 9-15 percent. At the same time the output of many basic  categories of machine-building products and a number of light  industry goods dropped almost by half; chemical industry  output--by 25-30 percent, and that of ferrous metallurgy--by  20-35 percent. Production of basic categories of foodstuffs  declined by 10-20 percent.    Over January-March 1994, of 406 most important categories of  products counted in periodic reports, average daily production,  as compared to January-March of 1993:    --increased with respect to 26 items, (including  foundry machines, machines used in municipal services,  production lines and automated systems for measuring and  packaging dry foods, dough-making components and machines, cash  registers, apathite concentrate, cinematographic and photo film,  polyvynilchloride resin, freezers, cotton fabrics, cooking salt,  high fat-content cheeses and feta cheese, and mayonnaise), or 6  percent of the total number;    --decreased with respect to 373 items, or 92  percent of the total number. With respect to 281 items (69  percent of the total number), production declined by one-quarter  or more; among them are lubricant oils, sheet rolled metal,  high-grade cold-rolled steel, metal cord, fire-resistant items,  low-power electric motors, light bulbs, mine electric carts,  self-propelled tower cranes, elevators, freight and passenger  rail cars, chemical fiber and thread, protein fodder additive,  phosphate and nitrogen fertilizer, commercial wood, lumber,  marches, cement, roof slate, construction brick, gypsum,  asbestos, sewing and washing machines, photo cameras, woolen and  silk fabrics, outer knitwear, footwear, lump sugar, macaroni  items, canned fish and meat, cereals, vodka, and hard liquor.    Over the elapsed period there was no production of computer  control systems, coal-cutters, yard and industrial diesel  locomotives, scrapers, self-propelled mower-crushers, grain  loaders, and flax-harvesting combines.    By the end of the quarter, stoppages at individual  production facilities had occurred at almost 5,000 enterprises.  And while at the beginning of last year the prevailing cause of  stoppages were shortages of input materials, components, and  fuel, in the first quarter of this year the main cause of  enterprise stoppages were difficulties in selling output (more  than 60 percent of all losses).    In a number of sectors distribution difficulties were the  result of lack of consumer demand stemming from a decline in  public need for the output produced (conversion); in others,  first and foremost those serving the consumer goods  sector--reorientation of solvent demand toward more competitive  imported goods.    In the fuel and power generation sectors in  January-March of this year extraction (production) of the main  varieties of energy resources continued to decline. Overall,  75.7 million tonnes of oil, including gas condensate, were  produced over the quarter (85 percent as compared to the first  quarter of 1993), 76.3 million tonnes (91 percent), and 165  billion cubic meters of gas (99.2 percent); electric power  generation declined by 4 percent as compared to the first  quarter of last year.    In ferrous metallurgy, in January-March of the  year, as compared to the corresponding period of last year,  production lagged with respect to pig iron smelting--20 percent,  steel--26 percent, production of finished rolled metal--24  percent, and steel pipe--48 percent.    In machine building, in the first quarter of this  year with respect to almost half the items counted in periodic  reports output amounted to 40 percent or less of the level of  the first quarter of last year. Production of large electric  machinery over the elapsed quarter as compared to the first  quarter of 1993 declined by 46 percent, metal-cutting machine  tools--by 50 percent, forge presses--by 68 percent, freight  cars--by 62 percent, trolley buses--by 52 percent, and passenger  cars--by 31 percent; production of electric travelling cranes  and self-propelled cranes declined by almost two thirds, of  bulldozers--almost by half, and production of scrapers was  suspended altogether.    In the chemical and petrochemical industry,  overall during the quarter output of the main raw material  products--synthetic ammonia, sulfuric acid, and caustic  soda--amounted to 72-79 percent of the level of last year's  first quarter, and of calcinated soda--51 percent. Mineral  fertilizer production dropped by 28 percent as compared to first  quarter of 1993; chemical thread and fiber--by 53 percent; and  automotive tires--by 44 percent.    In the chemical-pharmaceutical industry,  production of ampicillin amounted to a little more than  one-third on that of January-March of last year; validol and  levomicitin--about one-half, and euphillin--two-thirds. At the  same time, production of analgine, papaverine, and  nitroglycerine increased as compared to the first quarter of  1993.    In the timber, woodworking, and pulp and paper  industry in January-March of this year, as compared to the  corresponding period of last year the take-out volume of timber,  including round timber, declined by almost one-third, which led  to a decline in the production of lumber by 30 percent; the  output of commercial cellulose dropped by 34 percent, paper--by  26 percent, and cardboard--by 39 percent. Production of  effective substitutes for commercial wood, in particular,  cement-chip panels and technical wood chips for the production  of cellulose and wood pulp declined over the indicated period by  41-51 percent; of hardwood-fiber board and packaging  cardboard--by one-third, and wood-chip board--by 23 percent.    In the construction materials industry over the  first quarter of this year as compared to the corresponding  period of last year the output of cement declined by 35 percent,  soft roofing and insulation materials--by 44 percent; brick--by  26 percent; window glass--by 41 percent; wall materials,  prefabricated ferro-concrete, construction and technical lime,  and porous fillers--by 29-34 percent; and high-grade asbestos  and mineral cotton--by 50-55 percent. Production of home  appliances and fixtures--heating radiators and convectors, gas  stoves, and bath tubs--declined by 36-52 percent.    In light industry in the first quarter, as compared to the  first quarter of last year, output of fabrics declined by 19  percent, hosiery and knitwear--by 28 percent, and footwear--by  55 percent.    There was a considerable decline in the production of most  items in the garment industry: coats, short coats, and  skirts--by 61-68 percent, light coats and jackets--by 53-58  percent, and slacks and suits--by 41-42 percent.    In the production of complex home appliances in  January-March  of this year as compared to the same period of last year there  was an increase in the output of freezers, two- and  three-chamber refrigerators, and digital laser disk players.  Output of the most important items for cultural and household  use declined: washing machines--by 43 percent, tape  recorders--by 60 percent, television sets--by 24 percent, and  porcelain, stoneware, and majolica tableware and kitchenware--by  19 percent.    Over the elapsed period of the year there was a drop in  production of goods for small farms, house-adjacent plots and  gardens: engines and motorized cultivators--by 10 percent, and  mini-tractors--by more than one-quarter.    Among food items, in the first quarter of 1994, as  compared to the corresponding period of last year, there was an  increase in the output of high fat-content cheeses and feta  cheese, as well as mayonnaise.    Production of most foodstuffs declined as compared to the  first quarter of 1993: meat--by 25 percent, whole-milk  products--by 17 percent, butter--by 33 percent, vegetable  oil--by 11 percent, flour--by 16 percent, and cereals--by 35  percent.    There was a considerable drop as compared with January-March  of last year in the production of confectionery and macaroni  items, canned meat, starch, and baker's yeast (by 22-39  percent), lump sugar and food concentrates (by 56 percent and 47  percent, respectively). The output of bread and bakery items  dropped by 14 percent.    Production of vodka and hard liquor amounted to half of that  for the first quarter of 1993, including 57 percent in March.  <H5>  The Agro-Industrial Complex </H5>   Farms in the southern regions of Russia began sowing early  spring crops. According to reports from localities, because of  the long spring and heavy spring high-waters, the sowing  campaign in a number of territories began approximately two  weeks later than last year.    Readying equipment for operation is proceeding  more slowly than preceding years. At this point almost one-fifth  of tractors, soil-tilling equipment, and seeders are still  awaiting repair at Russian farms.    Industrial and distribution organizations have shipped  mineral fertilizer and fuel for agricultural needs in the  following volumes (millions of tonnes):                    January-March 1994            Including March                   shipped     as % of           shipped     as % of                              January-March                                                             March     February                                                            1993      1994   Materials       1.2         43                0.4         37        93  containing  lime--total   Peat outtake    15.2        41                4.9         36        103   Automotive      0.7         50                0.3         46        121  gasoline   Diesel fuel     1.4         48                0.5         39        119      The decline in shipped quantities of indicated material  resources was a result of lower production volume, as well as  poor solvency of agricultural consumers. As compared to the  corresponding period of last year, purchases in January-March of  this year dropped by more than half. As farms received credit  for the conduct of the spring sowing campaign, shipments of fuel  for agricultural needs increased over the past month as compared  to the preceding one by 19-21 percent.    Agricultural enterprises have been buying fuel and  lubricants  more actively lately. In March of this year farm petroleum  products warehouses received 58 percent more diesel fuel and 44  percent more gasoline than in February.

At agricultural farms, which are the main  producers of animal husbandry products, the volume of production  of meat and milk declined by 15-18 percent, and eggs--by 6  percent. Production of animal husbandry products at personal  plots remained at the same level as the corresponding period of  last year.    A decline in the animal herd is taking place mainly at  agricultural enterprises where the rate of herd reduction with  respect to horned cattle and swine amounted to 11-13 percent,  cows--6-7 percent, and sheep and goats--22-23 percent.  Remainders of fodder per standard head of cattle amounted at  these farms by the beginning of April of this year on average to  6 quintals of feed units, as compared to 5.3 quintals of feed  units by this time last year.    In the first quarter of this year procurement organizations  purchased for state stocks from all producers 28 percent less  livestock and poultry, 21 percent less milk, and 6 percent fewer  eggs than during the same period last year. At the same time,  agricultural enterprises increased sales of animal husbandry  products at farmers markets, through their own trade network,  the public catering system, and other channels.  <H5>  Sales of Fresh Produce </H5>   By 28 March of this year agricultural enterprises sold  through all distribution channels 17,500 tonnes of greenhouse  vegetables (24,200 tonnes in 1992). They sold 12,800 tonnes of  such products to procurement organizations (73 percent of the  total volume), which is one-third less than last year.

Since the beginning of the year 4,700 tonnes of greenhouse  produce (27 percent of the total volume of sales), as compared  to 4,200 tonnes (18 percent) last year, were sold through  farmers markets, their own trade enterprises, and the public  catering system.    The greatest decline in procurement of greenhouse produce  (three- to fourfold) occurred in Tambov, Penza, and Samara  Oblasts. Procurement of greenhouse produce at the farms in  Belgorod Oblast and Mordvinia amounted to only 4-12 percent of  last year's level.  <H5>  Standard of Living </H5>   The monetary income of the population over the  first quarter amounted to R53 trillion and was nine times  greater than in the first quarter of 1993. The share of the  payroll fund in the total volume of monetary income declined  from 65 percent in the first quarter of 1993 to 59 percent in  the first quarter of 1994.    The population's disposable income (income less mandatory  payments) increased by about 10 percent after factoring in the  consumer price index.

In the first quarter of 1994 the average wages  earned by workers increased 7.5-fold as compared to the first  quarter of 1993. The estimated average wage in March amounted to  R160,000 and increased 6.8-fold as compared to March 1993. Real  average monthly wages calculated after factoring in the consumer  price index declined in the first quarter of 1994 by 4 percent  as compared to the first quarter of 1993, and in March 1994 as  compared to March 1993--by 3 percent.  <H5>  Employment </H5>   The total economically active population in March 1994  numbered about 75 million, or 50 percent of the country's total  population. Of them, 70.5 million persons were engaged in all  categories of economic activities and 4.4 million persons were  not engaged but actively searching and in keeping with ILO  methodology were classified as unemployed. Taking into account  those working part-time, total unemployment potential amounted  to 8.8 million persons, or 11.7 percent of the economically  active population. One million persons, or 1.3 percent of the  total economically active population, were officially designated  as unemployed by organs of the state employment service.</p>

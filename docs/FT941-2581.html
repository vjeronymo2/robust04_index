			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: No IHT on this gift I am aged 79 and have about Pounds 10,000 of my Pounds 28,000 after-tax income unspent each year. Can I give this surplus to my daughter without an inheritance tax liability? If the answer is yes, do I have to ask or inform the tax inspector? If you wish to give the Pounds 10,000 annual excess to your daughter, we suggest you document clearly, by letter or deed, your intention to make a regular annual gift. You might also wish to set it up by way of a standing order to your daughter so that it is clear the payment is to be made regularly. In any case, it would appear that no IHT would be payable as the gift would be paid out of net income and does not affect adversely your usual standard of living. (Reply by Barry Stillerman of accountant Stoy Hayward). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

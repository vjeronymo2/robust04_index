			<p><P> February 18, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BANE GIVEN $18,000 BY 2 FIRMS FAVORED IN FAILED BILL  </P> <P> Shortly after accepting $18,000 in campaign contributions from two financial  institutions early last year, Assemblyman Tom Bane (D-Tarzana) introduced  legislation that opponents said would have aided the two firms in a pending  multimillion-dollar lawsuit.  </P> <P> The measure, introduced by Bane in February, 1988, prohibited litigants in  civil lawsuits from obtaining confidential information from the state  Department of Savings and Loans through a subpoena. The bill, supported by the  California League of Savings Institutions, passed the Assembly with no  opposition last year but died in the Senate.  </P> <P> An Assembly consultant and the bill's opponents say the measure could have been  retroactive, thereby affecting the pending lawsuit. The defendants in the case  were financial institutions seeking to prevent documents obtained from the  savings and loans department with a subpoena from being introduced as evidence  against them. Both were major contributors to Bane.  </P> <P> Bane did not return phone calls Friday. The Daily News of Los Angeles reported  that he said he did nothing improper, quoting Bane as saying he intended to  prevent disclosure of all confidential savings and loans department records  without a court order, including those involved in the pending legal case.  </P> <P> Bane, chairman of the influential Rules Committee and a champion of the savings  and loan industry, reportedly said: "I would have introduced the bills if there  were no contributions. Anything wrongly obtained should be returned."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Clarify Existing Law  </P> <P> The Department of Savings and Loans said the measure would merely clarify  existing law, said Kenneth Cooley, chief counsel for the Assembly Finance and  Insurance Committee, which unanimously sent the bill to the Assembly with  little discussion. He said such a clarification could have been considered  retroactive, although Assembly committee members were not informed that it  might apply to an ongoing lawsuit.  </P> <P> The retroactive provision of the bill could have affected pending litigation  involving American Savings &amp; Loan of Stockton, which was then financially  ailing and has since been divided into two financial institutions, and Gramercy  Mortgage, a Burlingame-based affiliate of Homestead Savings.  </P> <P> Both companies were named in a December, 1982, lawsuit filed by Dividend  Development Corp. of Santa Clara. Dividend alleges that American and Gramercy  improperly foreclosed on two large real estate projects in the Bay Area and is  seeking $40 million in damages. The suit accuses Homestead of fraudulent  misrepresentation and concealment, breach of contract and unfair business  practices. Homestead filed a countersuit against Dividend; the litigation is  pending.  </P> <P> Dividend Development used a subpoena in 1985 to obtain confidential state  Department of Savings and Loans documents about the foreclosure that "severely  impeach Homestead's defenses and claims in the litigation," said Peter Fortune,  Dividend's attorney. Homestead claimed the documents were released illegally  and had sought unsuccessfully in court to suppress the materials.  </P> <P> Bane received a $6,000 campaign contribution from Gramercy on Jan. 11 and  another $6,000 Feb. 1. On Jan. 25, he received a $6,000 contribution from  American Savings &amp; Loan. He had also received $5,000 from each firm in  early 1987. The contributions coincide with Bane's Valentine's Day dinner, his  major annual fund-raiser. He introduced the savings and loan bill Feb. 17.  </P> <P> After the bill passed the Senate Banking and Commerce Committee in June,  Dividend hired lobbyist Herb Nobriga, a former consultant to the Assembly  Judiciary Committee, to oppose it. Nobriga said he informed banking committee  Chairwoman Rose Ann Vuich that the measure could affect the pending Dividend  lawsuit. Vuich then retrieved the bill for a second look by her committee in  August.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Legislation Failed  </P> <P> "We don't like to pass out legislation that affects a court case," she said  Friday. She added that it died when Bane failed to ask for it to be heard  again.  </P> <P> State law makes it illegal to accept contributions in return for a specific  action, such as sponsoring or supporting a bill. Bane has maintained that the  savings and loan industry backs him because he supports their role in financing  home construction and creating jobs.  </P> <P> Bane ran a national savings and loan association for a decade. He received a  total of $102,480 in campaign contributions from savings and loans in 1987-88,  nearly 10% of the $1.1 million he raised, according to campaign reports.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Alan C. Miller reported from Los Angeles and Mark Gladstone from Sacramento.  </P></p>

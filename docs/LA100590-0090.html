			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> OPTIMISM: Apparently it takes a lot of recession talk before Orange County gets  scared. . . . Last winter, a survey showed that about one in five county  households planned to buy a new car.  </P> <P> By late summer, that figure had risen to about one in four, despite a year of  recession speculation. In fact, more than half of those surveyed in August  thought they'd be "better off financially" a year hence. Only 8% thought they'd  wind up worse off. . . . But the jury's still out. Surveys taken after the  Mideast crisis and federal deficit developments have not yet been tallied.  Steve Emmons and Mark I. Pinsky  </P></p>

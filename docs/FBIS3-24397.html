			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Lukin, chairman of RF State Duma's </F> International Affairs Committee, by Irina Denisova, under  "Credo" rubric: "A Period of Heightened Nervousness Lies Ahead.  `But It Isn't Mortal,' Assures RF State Duma's International  Affairs Committee Chairman Vladimir Lukin"; time and place not  given]    [Text] [Denisova] Vladimir Petrovich, you have been a  journalist and an ambassador; you are a professor, doctor of  historical science, and a well-known politician. What was most  important for your professional career? And whom do you feel  yourself to be?    [Lukin] It's hard to say. It all happened spontaneously. As  they say, "Fate leads those who agree and drags those who  disagree." In my case, it either led or dragged me, but I didn't  resist.    As for whom I feel myself to be... Perhaps, first of all, "a  citizen of the place where I live, but at the same time, a grain  of sand of the Universe." One of my detractors said, aptly,  "Vladimir Petrovich sees life as if he were looking out of the  window of a speeding train." A desire to be inside life, "in a  situation," and at the same time to look at it as it were from  outside is, I think a good, useful quality.    [Denisova] In 1968, when you were working in Prague at the  international magazine, PROBLEMS OF PEACE AND SOCIALISM, you  spoke out against the introduction of soviet troops into  Czechoslovakia, for which you were deported to the USSR. For  more than 11 years you were under a travel ban.    [Lukin] There were several of us then who were  "ceremoniously" dispatched to Moscow. In the same plane with us  was Misha Polyakov, a nice guy, a specialist on America. There  were also Kirill Khenkin and his wife Ira Kanevskaya--they are  now working at Radio Liberty in Munich. There were others, as  well.    [Denisova] The last two years you were the Russian  ambassador  in the United States. What were you able and not able to achieve  during your ambassadorship?    [Lukin] An ambassador's is a bureaucratic job. Although I  respect the ambassador's mission, I would say that in many ways  it is a symbiosis of a postman and a waiter "with airs." A  postman, because you get a communication from Moscow, with a  list of whom to deliver it to, and what to say in the process.  People in the host country are interested not in your personal  opinion, which you are free to express unofficially: an  ambassador is obligated to communicate the point of view of his  country's official circles, the president or foreign minister.  Well, and a waiter, because you continuously have to meet and  treat high-ranking delegations.    [Denisova] And were you successful?    [Lukin] The first thing I managed was to master the  ambassador's trade. I had specialized in international affairs  and for a time worked on the central staff of the Foreign  Ministry, but I had never been an ambassador. In Washington it  took time for me to get to know the "thousand details" of the  operation of a large embassy with a complex staff.    The second thing I managed was to create an image of an  authentic representative of our country during the time I  represented it. I was, after all, the first Russian ambassador  since 1917. Besides, I represented it during a period of  development of democratic structures in our country. I have at  home a U.S. diplomat of the year award. The means the Americans  felt my work was successful.    And third, I managed to establish good contacts with our  compatriots. They saw me off literally with tears in their eyes.  Yet until recently they would give a wide berth to our embassy.    During that time I got to know the work of the Foreign  Ministry's central staff fairly well. Alas, it is in constant  turmoil, with endless restructuring and reorganizations. Does  this serve any useful purpose? In both the central and foreign  staffs discipline and interest in diplomatic work have declined  sharply. Personnel policy is in disarray, and some appointments  are simply bewildering. In addition, there is a lack of  coordination or sense of cohesion in the work of one of the  country's most important ministries. And, incidentally, with  one of the smallest, if not the smallest staffs: there are less  than 3,000 diplomatic personnel. In other words, something which  was always very important to me and without which it is  difficult to achieve good results is lacking: a cohesive,  smoothly functioning "team" at both the lower and upper levels  of the ministry.    [Denisova] Your differences with Andrey Kozyrev are known,  especially concerning views on the development of relations with  the United States and the West as a whole.    [Lukin] What can I say... When I am asked if I have  differences with Kozyrev I say, no, and none are possible. One's  opinions may differ from those of a person who has opinions of  his own. But what if he changes them every three months? What  differences can there be in that case? Whoever is interested in  this can compare what I said six months or a year ago with what  I am saying now. And what Kozyrev has said during the same time.  Everything will become clear. I have not changed my views and am  not changing them now.    The situation developed in such a way that in his address to  the Federal Assembly the president sharply criticized our  diplomacy; he said what I have been saying over the last two or  two and a half years. I am very pleased that our views coincide.  Although I wouldn't like to look like the frog that says, "It  was my idea! It was my idea!" I simply want our foreign policy  to be independent, active, and show initiative. That it be given  its due in the world and, most important, by our people. A good  example, albeit an exception, that confirms the rule was our  initiative in the Bosnian crisis.    I suggested something. That "something" was taken up by the  president and, in words, by the foreign minister. It would be  alright if it had ended in a handshake with Kozyrev, as is  customary in civilized society. But then a series of intrigues  began... That, however, is not so important, the case isn't  mortal.    [Denisova] As I recall, it was not without your help that  Kozyrev became foreign minister.    [Lukin] Yes, I recommended him to Yeltsin. Actually, I  recommended two people. Kozyrev was the second, but the first  had declined.    [Denisova] You just visited the United States with a Russian  parliamentary delegation, you met with congressmen, diplomats,  military people. Did you gain the impression that the latest  events would substantially harm Russian-American relations for a  considerable time?    [Lukin] The problem is that our diplomacy made some very  serious mistakes, moreover, of a conceptual nature. Currently  they are being overcome on the conceptual level. But the  Americans have already grown used to our smiling, passive,  doting, a priori agreement with them, and it is hard for them to  readjust. That is why we are now doomed to a period (not very  long, I think) of heightened nervousness and some controversy. I  don't believe that there will be any marked deterioration of  relations; there is no reason for that. But there will be a  period of painful acceptance by the United States that Russia is  a state which also has its national interests.    [Denisova] This is the second time you are heading a  parliamentary foreign affairs committee. Is the committee  capable, in the current situation, of influencing the  formulation of the country's foreign policy and changing the  situation in the Foreign Ministry?    [Lukin] The unhealthy situation in the Foreign Ministry has  developed primarily because it is deteriorating as a highly  professional collective; 500 active professional workers left it  last year alone. The Foreign Ministry should work as a cohesive  collective, not as a "group of comrades" consisting of 7-8  people who make foreign policy while flying constantly from one  airport to another. There should be concern for people in both  the material and every other sense, but for that it is necessary  to be "in the business" at least sometimes. Otherwise the  diplomatic service will collapse completely. If the best forces  leave, in future we will have no high-quality diplomacy. So far  I don't know how to help solve this problem at the present  stage, because under the current constitution the committee has  no oversight functions with respect to the Foreign Ministry.  However, we will, of course, do all we can for its personnel.    As for our influence in the formulation of foreign policy  per  se, it will be realized in strict accordance with the  constitution. During the election campaign I criticized some of  its provisions, but once it has been adopted it must be obeyed.    Under the Constitution the president determines and conducts  foreign policy with the help of the Foreign Ministry. In this  sense there should be no competition or attempts to invade their  authority on the part of the Duma. At the same time, the Duma  ratifies foreign treaties. Ratification is a powerful lever for  influencing foreign policy. If its formulation is approached  constructively, in the spirit of cooperation of the branches of  power--which I would like very much--then we will be consulted  before signing a treaty or agreement. Then we will be able to  suggest what should or should not be done for the ratification  of a document to proceed smoothly.    [Denisova] But so far they seem to get along without your  advice?    [Lukin] Yes, if you have in mind the treaty with Georgia.  They signed it first and only then realized that it would be  very difficult to have it ratified. As a result, the president  decided to temporarily postpone ratification. I hope they will  eventually understand in the Foreign Ministry that it doesn't  pay to bypass the parliament.    I would also like to note that the appointment and recalling  of envoys is done by the president after consultations with the  appropriate committees of the Federal Assembly. The consultation  mechanism is currently being worked out and should soon be put  into effect. For example, as soon as I returned to Moscow (that  was before the president's decree to recall me from the United  States) I gathered the committee to approve my being relieved of  my duties. We then sent an appropriate document to the  president's office, after which the decree was issued. We shall  continue in future to work in accordance with regulations, and  the Foreign Ministry and president's office will, perhaps,  submit their comments and suggestions to us. I hope we establish  mutual understanding and effective cooperation with them.</p>

			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia to lift crude sales Russian crude oil exports outside the former Soviet Union may rise by 10-15 per cent this year, according to Mr Oleg Davydov, the foreign economic relations minister, reports Reuters from Moscow. He told the Itar-Tass news agency that Russia had to increase oil exports to support producers, who were struggling to find solvent consumers in the domestic and other FSU markets. Fuel and Energy Ministry officials had said earlier that 1994 crude exports would total more than last year's 80m tonnes but ruled out a sharp increase in sales to the West because of limited port and pipeline capacity. Mr Davydov mentioned the capacity restrictions on oil exports but said that new avenues were opening up, including through Ukraine, which had lowered transit tariffs to Dollars 5-Dollars 6 a tonne from Dollars 8-Dollars 11.</p>

			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / International Company News: Breeden joins accountants MR Richard Breeden, former chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, is joining the international accountancy and consultancy firm Coopers &amp; Lybrand as a senior partner. The firm said yesterday that Mr Breeden, who served as SEC chairman from 1989 until last month, will help run Coopers' US and international financial services groups. Mr Breeden, 43, will lead the firm's efforts in providing advice to clients on capital markets and regulation, and in the privatisation of foreign companies, a business which Coopers has pioneered. The appointment is a coup for Coopers, which will be able to exploit Mr Breeden's political clout, his understanding of international regulatory issues and his experience of the global securities business.</p>

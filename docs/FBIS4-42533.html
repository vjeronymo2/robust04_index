			<p>BFN     [Text] PARIS, June 3 (AFP) -- The president of the  opposition Democratic League of Kosovo, Ibrahim Rugova, was  received Friday [3 June] in Paris by French Minister for  European Affairs Alain Lamassoure, the French Foreign Ministry  said.    The Ministry said the meeting underlined the attention Paris  was paying to the situation in Kosovo, a Serb-administered  province but whose population almost exclusively comprises  ethnic Albanians.    Lamassoure said France favoured a policy of dialogue between  communities in the province along with respect for human rights.    He added Paris supported internationally-recognised autonomy  for Kosovo, which had been repealed by Belgrade in 1989.    Rugova told a press conference Thursday he hoped France  would  back the idea of establishing a United Nations protectorate in  Kosovo, in line with a plan he proposed to the world body early  last year.</p>

			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Samsung to invest Pounds 450m in UK: North-east factory will create 3,000 jobs - S Koreans reject rival EU sites Samsung of South Korea, the world's 14th largest industrial group, is to invest Pounds 450m to build a manufacturing plant at Wynyard, Cleveland, in the north-east of England. The factory, which will produce consumer goods ranging from microwave ovens to computer monitors for the European market, will eventually create 3,000 jobs and provide a considerable psychological boost for a region where high unemployment seems endemic. The Korean company also plans to move its European headquarters from Frankfurt to London as part of the deal. The investment was unveiled yesterday by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, during a visit to Seoul. He said Samsung was attracted to the UK because of 'competitive wage rates without the social charter'. Mr John Bridge, chief executive of the Northern Development Company, the inward investment and economic regeneration agency for north-east England and Cumbria, said he believed Samsung's presence would stimulate investment from other companies in related activities such as plastic injection moulding, metal casing manufacture and wiring systems production. Samsung's plan is the latest in a series of large investments in the UK by foreign companies. Last month NEC, the Japanese electronics giant, said it intended to spend Pounds 530m to build a semiconductor manufacturing plant at Livingston, near Edinburgh. The UK government offered Samsung Pounds 58m in regional grants and loans to secure the project. Together with indirect aid, the support is equivalent to 20 per cent of Samsung's investment. Samsung's decision follows stiff competition from other European countries, including Spain, where it has manufactures television and video recorders, Portugal, France and Germany. The Cleveland investment dwarfs other Korean investments in the European Union. Mr Chan Bea, managing director of Samsung's UK operations, said the decision had been influenced by the proximity of Cleveland to Scotland's 'Silicon Glen' where a large number of computer manufacturers, potential customers for Samsung's electronics products, are located. He said the move was part of Samsung's globalisation strategy and a move against possible anti-dumping measures by the EU. Samsung intends initially to manufacture 1.3m microwave ovens and 1m computer monitors annually at the Cleveland site. It will add production facilities for personal computers, facsimile machines, colour display tubes and semiconductors. The plant should be completed by 1999 when it should be generating Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.25bn) in turnover, about half the group's total European sales. Samsung manufactures a broad range of products, from semiconductors and personal computers to ships, petrochemicals and medical equipment. Samsung Electronics was established in the UK in 1969. It makes 700,000 televisions a year in Teesside, and earlier this year, supported by the Department of Trade and Industry, agreed to invest Pounds 11m over three years in the plant.

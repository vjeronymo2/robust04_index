			<p><P> July 30, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHANCE TO START ISN'T WASTED BY SCHROEDER  </P> <P> Bill Schroeder doesn't lament his limited playing time, not after a sore elbow  kept him on the disabled list until July 2 and nearly convinced him his time  was up as a major league catcher.  </P> <P> "I don't feel frustrated at all," Schroeder said Sunday after hitting two home  runs and guiding Jim Abbott through seven strong innings in the Angels' 6-2  victory over Seattle at the Kingdome.  </P> <P> "I'm happy to be in the position I am," Schroeder said. "A month and a half  ago, I never thought I'd be in this position. I don't feel frustrated -- I feel  pretty lucky."  </P> <P> For Schroeder, the satisfaction of playing so impressively ran deep.  </P> <P> "At this point of my career, that's my role (catching behind Lance Parrish) and  I'm happy with it," said Schroeder, who hit a fastball off Seattle starter Matt  Young (5-11) that barely cleared the right field fence in the fourth inning to  give the Angels a 3-1 lead, and who provided the fifth run with a drive off  Gene Harris in the eighth.  </P> <P> "Six weeks ago, two months ago I didn't think I'd be able to even do this. I'm  tickled to death to be able to go out there."  </P> <P> Abbott (7-9) was glad to have Schroeder as his mentor. Led by Schroeder to use  his slider and curveball more than he might have been inclined to on his own,  Abbott was in command throughout and showed poise in escaping a bases-loaded  jam in the first inning and a second-and-third, one-out situation in the sixth.  </P> <P> "I thought Bill had a great game. He called a great game, and the fact that he  got two home runs was a bonus," said Abbott, who walked four and struck out  three. "He's a solid catcher, and I'm real comfortable working with him. We  probably hadn't worked together in a long time, but he was really solid."  </P> <P> He was better than that, according to Manager Doug Rader. "The work he did  behind the plate was extremely good," Rader said. "Abbie used all his pitches,  and Bill blocked the ball well. I don't take him for granted. A guy may have  done the job 1,000 times, but when he does it the 1,001st, you've got to  remember to be grateful for it."  </P> <P> Abbott got single runs in the first, third and fourth innings.  </P> <P> In the first, Brian Downing and Donnie Hill walked and Downing scored when  first baseman Pete O'Brien couldn't handle Dave Winfield's shot.  </P> <P> Hill scored from second base in the third inning when Harold Reynolds misplayed  a double-play ball hit by Winfield, throwing wildly to first.  </P> <P> "I know they've been struggling scoring runs," Young said. "Pete O'Brien makes  that play 99 out of 100 times. The ball just took a funny hop. And in the  third, Winfield hit a routine double-play ball that could easily have gotten us  out of the inning. These things happen."  </P> <P> Schroeder's home run in the fourth barely cleared the fence, to Schroeder's  surprise.  </P> <P> "I never saw it because of the lights," said Schroeder, whose only other home  run this season was in the Angels' 20-7 humiliation July 8 at Milwaukee. "I was  jogging to first. It's a good thing it went out, because I would have been  standing on first. The second one was the only one I knew was out as soon as I  hit it."  </P> <P> Dante Bichette preceded Schroeder with a home run to left field, his 13th of  the season, and the Angels added another run in the ninth inning on a walk to  Downing, a double by Hill, an intentional walk to White and Winfield's  fielder's choice.  </P> <P> "That's the way we used to play the game . . . ," before the proliferation of  those rotisserie leagues," Downing said of the Angels' opportunistic innings.  "It kind of gets lost in the shuffle. If you make a pitcher throw enough  pitches to you over and over, it can make a difference."  </P> <P> Abbott was sharp and confident. He had yielded a run in the third inning on a  walk, Jeffrey Leonard's single and Alvin Davis' sacrifice fly, but the game  hinged on Abbott's mastery in the sixth inning. With Davis on third base and  Edgar Martinez on second, Abbott threw six consecutive sliders to strike out  David Valle and get Omar Vizquel to fly to center and preserve a 3-1 lead.  </P> <P> "I was more worried about Vizquel hitting something over somebody's head,"  Schroeder said. "I had talked to Lance a lot about what he had been doing (with  Abbott's repertoire), and he said they'd been going with curveballs and  changeups and that's basically what we were doing. He was throwing the ball  hard and he had a real good slider and we used six sliders for two outs."  </P> <P> While Schroeder was sidelined because of the surgery he underwent last  September, he never counted himself out. "I'm healthy and my arm feels good,  better than all of last year," he said. "I want to get the opportunity at some  point to catch a few days in a row and prove I can do it. . . . I'm not saying  my arm feels 100%, but I'm able to do what I have to do every day."  </P> <P> Angel Notes  </P> <P> Bryan Harvey relieved Jim Abbott in the eighth inning after a single by Jeffrey  Leonard and a double by Alvin Davis and gave up a sacrifice fly to Scott  Bradley that scored the Mariners' final run. Harvey allowed one hit over two  innings to earn his 12th save, one behind club leader Mark Eichhorn.  </P> <P> Pitcher Bert Blyleven, who shaved his beard after losing at Oakland last  Wednesday, is growing it back because of popular demand. His teammates' demand,  that is. "They said, 'Cover that face!' " Blyleven said.  </P> <P> Outfielder Dave Winfield, a native of St. Paul, Minn., will participate in the  groundbreaking of a $5.5 million indoor softball facility in the Twin Cities  suburb of Lino Lakes Tuesday. Winfield is a consultant and adviser to the group  funding the venture, Inside Sports, Inc. Winfield, who still has a home in the  Twin Cities, today will play host to a lunch for his Angel teammates and  several of his relatives.  </P></p>

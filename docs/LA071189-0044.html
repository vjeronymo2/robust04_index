			<p><P> July 11, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY ROUNDUP: OWNER OF SOLLEY'S SELLS 2 OF HIS 4 RESTAURANTS  </P> <P> The owner of the four Solley's restaurants/delicatessens in the San Fernando  Valley has sold two of his outlets for an undisclosed amount.  </P> <P> Sol Zide said last week that he sold the Solley's in Northridge to his brother,  Abe, who had spent 16 years working with him. That restaurant is expected to be  renamed Abe's. Zide said he also sold his Encino restaurant to a group led by  the owners of Jerry's Famous Deli in Studio City.  </P> <P> Zide, 46, will retain ownership of his original outlet in Woodland Hills, which  he opened 18 years ago, and his other restaurant in Sherman Oaks.  </P> <P> Zide said he decided to sell the two restaurants because running all four had  become too burdensome. "I found myself stressed out and not happy," he said.  "I'm once again talking to the customers, which I missed sorely over the past  few years."  </P></p>

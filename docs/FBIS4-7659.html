Mr. Koenig and Mr. Columberg are here in connection with the  Parliamentary Assembly's decision to check on the compliance of  newly-admitted member countries with membership requirements and  to draft a resolution on the current political situation in this  country. In parliament they met with Bulgaria's permanent  delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly, as well as with  representatives of the five parliamentary groups. Each of them  set forth its views on the current political situation, the  government's economic and financial policy, the human rights of  minorities, parliament's law-making and the difficulties faced  by this country during the transition period.    Today Mr. Koenig and Mr. Columberg met with National  Assembly  Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov. He stressed that the political  forces are in agreement on the principles and priorities of  Bulgaria's foreign policy. He pointed out that the reforms have  slowed down, stressing that they must continue.    Acting Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev and Justice Minister  Petur Kornazhev today met with Mr. Koenig and Mr. Columberg.  The government press office said the guests had been  familiarized in detail with the government's activity, as well  as with the formidable difficulties it has to deal with.

			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / International Bonds: Dollar sector holds stage with Dollars 600m Amexco offer ISSUANCE in the international bond market picked up yesterday as borrowers felt it was safe to return now that the World Bank's Dollars 1.25bn global offering was out of the way. The dollar sector remained the most active, as American Express raised Dollars 600m through an offering of seven-year global bonds. The bonds, which are backed by charge card debt, were priced to yield 38 basis points over the yield on the 8 3/4 per cent US Treasury due 2000, at the lower end of the indicated range. Lead manager Lehman Brothers, a subsidiary of American Express, said that just under one-third of the offering was placed outside the US. American Express raised Dollars 1bn through a similar offering last year. Hydro-Quebec raised Dollars 200m through an offering of 12-year collared floating rate notes and its rarity value in this market helped it to beat its funding target by several basis points. Most of the FRN offerings have been made by banks seeking to raise subordinated debt. By contrast, Hydro-Quebec is the first provincial agency in several months to issue senior notes in the FRN market. Elsewhere, the Province of Ontario and the World Bank provided badly-needed liquidity in the Canadian dollar sector. Syndicate managers said there was strong demand from investors for Canadian dollar paper because of the favourable outlook for the currency. There have been few Canadian dollar deals in recent weeks and spreads on outstanding issues have tightened considerably as a result. For example, the spread on British Colombia's CDollars 400m 12-year offering has dropped to 42 basis points from its spread at launch on August 31 of 50 basis points over the 7 1/2 per cent Canadian Treasury due 2003. Ontario's CDollars 500m offering of 12-year Eurobonds was priced to yield 63 basis points over 10-year Canadian Treasuries, which matched the yield on the borrower's 10-year global bonds. The World Bank's CDollars 200m five-year offering was seen to be tightly priced, at a yield spread of 10 basis points over the yield on the 6 1/2 per cent Canadian Treasury due 1998. However, demand was such that the bonds sold out quickly and the spread tightened to less than nine basis points in the afternoon. The World Bank is thought to have swapped the proceeds into D-Marks. In the Eurosterling sector, Barclays Bank raised Pounds 100m through an issue of fixed-rate perpetual Eurobonds. Barclays hopes to tap the current demand among UK retail investors for high-yielding paper by providing them with an option to take the bonds in registered form. In general, UK retail investors are reluctant to buy bearer bonds. The bonds were priced to yield 155 basis points over the yield on the 8 3/4 per cent UK government bond due 2017, a spread of five basis points over Halifax Building Society's Pounds 100m issue of permanent interest bearing shares which came earlier this week. Lead manager BZW said there was a finite demand for this sort of product and Sun Alliance's recent announcement that it intended to launch a Pounds 300m undated preference share issue might deter other borrowers from tapping this area of the market.</p>

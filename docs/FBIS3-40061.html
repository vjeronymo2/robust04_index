Hong Kong's Executive and Legislative Councils (EXCO and  LEGCO) were clearly the advisory bodies for the Hong Kong  governor, who was president of both councils. While EXCO was  the Hong Kong governor's most important advisory and  policymaking body, all key decisions of the Hong Kong  administration were made by the Hong Kong governor. Almost all  of the highest officials in the Hong Kong administration were  members of EXCO.    The Hong Kong administration's LEGCO, in addition to having  appointments of some government officials as  "administration-defense members," also recruited some  outstanding public figures from areas, such as industrial and  commercial circles, the professional world, and mid- and  upper-level figures from certain community groups. The Hong Kong  public elected each year 10 outstanding young people, a great  many of whom, such as Li P'eng-fei [2621 7720 7378] and Li  Chu-ming [2621 2691 6900], were recruited by the Hong Kong  government to take part in the administration.    These figures took part in the administration in an advisory  capacity, having no decisionmaking authority. While EXCO  proposals were submitted for discussion to LEGCO, which could  propose ammendments, the final decisionmaking authority on their  acceptance rested with the Hong Kong governor.    The Hong Kong administration's practice of this consultative  system contributed to Hong Kong's economic development.    As the Hong Kong administration had organized an advisory  committee of over 300 members appointed by the Hong Kong  administration, including outstanding figures from all walks of  life, it was said that the administration was an outstanding  regime. Generally speaking, whenever there was an issue, a  particular profession had any legislative problems, or the  government proposed a program, the pertinent departments would  solicit opinions from the advisory committee, whose views were  submitted to the pertinent departments, EXCO, and the Hong Kong  governor for either adoption or ammendment.    While this consultative system was essentially within the  Hong Kong governor's monopoly-power political framework, it did  enable the Hong Kong governor within certain limits to give a  little "democracy" to mid- and upper social levels, providing  them with opportunities to both learn about government decisions  in advance, as well as to express their opinions, so could be  said to be a certain degree of "participatory" or  "representative" government.    Hong Kong's 19 district assemblies were also part of the  consultative framework, aimed at providing residents with a  certain degree of participation in district affairs. These  district assemblies mostly joined grassroots mid- or lower-  levels, with each district assembly carrying out a "plan for  meeting with residents," so that residents from the district  could make appointments for meetings with district assembly  members, in order to express their views on any district  matters, and propose means of making improvements.    Hong Kong's 19 districts had 71 advisory service centers  where questions about government work were answered free of  charge, with 127 sub-district committees and over 4,000 village  organizations to provide the government with a widespread and  quite effective liasion network with grassroots residents.    As the Hong Kong administration consulted with residents  through these channels, this consultative organization became a  key part of the ruling framework under the control of the Hong  Kong administration's government affairs office.    Hongkongers said that Hong Kong had three governors: 1) the  governor appointed by the British Crown; 2. the board chairman  of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation who, with his  decisive financial might and prerogatives, had become Hong  Kong's financial "governor"; 3) the Racing Association, which  could be said to be the psychological ruler of quite a few  Hongkongers.    The Racing Association held horse races twice a week for  four  months out of the year (June through September), with the  betting reaching tens of millions of dollars [HK] a race,  hundreds of millions a racing day, 12 billion for all of 1983,  and over 30 billion by the eve of my departure in 1989. Hong  Kong had two horserace tracks, the older one dirt and the newer  sand, where each race not only saw the stands packed with tens  of thousands of people, but also included offtrack bettors,  attracting up to a million people, all of whom hoped to win.  Every week brought two chances for several bettors to get rick  quick and become mid- and small-size millionaires, while others  went bankrupt and committed suicide. I held that while most  people could be said to be "willing taxpayers" for the  government, the Racing Association acted as a narcotic to make  residents unconsciously satisfied with the status quo, with many  trying to get rich by luck instead of looking for other routes  to wealth.    There was also a lottery, which twice a week created several  millionaires and nouveau riches, playing the same role.    As British Hong Kong rule was quite successful, the mid and  upper levels of society certainly did not essentially contain  any organized mindset to overthrow colonial rule, developing a  rather widespread dependent mentality instead. As Hong Kong's  upper levels, and even quite a few mid-level figures, lacked  political independence, it must be said that Britain's colonial  rule in this case was successful. The Hong Kong administration  also awarded each year several imperial decorations of various  grades, such as "Gentleman of Peace" and "OBE," which were  conferred on outstanding public figures from all walks of life  by the Hong Kong governor himself, or even by the Queen, as well  as rewarding administration officials for "achievements or  contributions," thus winning over Hongkongers' hearts, giving  them a sense of honor and belonging. But other Hongkongers  poked fun at these decorations, calling them "Dutch water (soda)  bottlecaps."    Generally speaking, the Hong Kong administration formed the  structure for rule of Hong Kong by the Hong Kong administraion  through the law, the police, the military, and the  consultative organization, accompanied by social organizations,  such as the Racing Association, charitable institutions, and  churches. British rule in Hong Kong was a sort of "benevolent"  dictatorship. Or it could be called conciliatory rule with a  large degree of freedom. While it was not democratic, it did  give people, without threatening British colonial rule, various  opportunities to vent their discontent or dissent, which  discontent and dissent was heard and ameliorated to a certain  extent.    The third feature of the Hong Kong administration was that  it  had a civil service. The Hong Kong administration's various  departments were essentially composed of permanent staffs, who  needed certain qualifications (such as professional knowledge),  but had lifetime employment through set procedures of internal  training and promotions. Moreover, officials had only to swear  allegiance to the British Crown, not being troubled with the  problem of having to maintain neutrality in party struggles,  giving them an even greater sense of dedication.    These three major features of the Hong Kong administration  showed that British rule in Hong Kong for the last century plus,  particularly the last several decades, had been successful in  maintaining Hong Kong's stability, particularly its economic  growth in the last two decades. So when drawing up the Basic  Law, we needed to notice and utilize this, discarding its  colonialism, assimilating its freedom, and developing its  democracy, as one of our key grounds for establishing after 1997  a highly autonomous democratic system with prosperity and  stability.</p>

			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / International Company News: Reader's Digest in share offer READER'S Digest, the New York based magazine publisher, said the two non-profit foundations that together control 96.6 per cent of the company's voting stock are planning to make a public offer of 4.5m of these shares, reducing their equity stake to 74.8 per cent. A share listing is being sought on the New York Stock Exchange for the voting shares, known as class B. The pricing of the share offer, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, will be in relation to the already traded class A non-voting stock. That would imply the share offer could raise more than Dollars 200m for the two foundations. The reason for the offer is that the foundations are required by US tax law to reduce their ownership of voting stock to a total of no more than 50 per cent by the year 2000. Reader's Digest said that after the class B share offer it planned to repurchase up to 3m shares of class A non-voting stock that is traded on Wall Street. These shares rose by Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 47 yesterday. It also unveiled a 13 per cent increase in net profits for the second quarter to December 31, to Dollars 62.8m. Revenues were 10 per cent higher at Dollars 712.4m.</p>

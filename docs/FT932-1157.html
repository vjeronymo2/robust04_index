			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Brundtland warning on EC entry NORWAY'S prime minister, Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, yesterday warned the electorate that voting against her Labour party in protest at plans for European Community membership could force her from office this year even if Labour wins the September election, Karen Fossli writes from Oslo. 'Those who think they can vote for another party and still have a Labour government must think again.' Labour has lost support steadily to the anti-EC centre and socialist parties since Mrs Brundtland declared her intention to bring Norway into the EC nearly two years ago.</p>

			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / How to Spend it: Be crafty with your presents this year - Lucia van der Post trawls the craft fairs, shops and stalls in search of individual gifts with character and style. Shecomes up with a range of goodies as diverse as champagne flutes and pig paintings Jack-in-the-box Christmas fun CRAFT FAIRS are, of course, one of the best places to look for presents if what you are after is something fresh, original and unlike the mass-manufactured goodies that most of us unwrap on Christmas morning. This year there are more fairs than ever to choose from - standards vary widely but almost all offer something of the fun of the treasure-hunt, with bits of tat to be found sitting next to pieces of stunning beauty. Covent Garden has its Apple Market stalls every day from Tuesday to Saturday which sell everything from handmade silver, jewellery and sweaters to this jolly collection of Jack in the Boxes by the Jack in the Box Company. Small sizes are Pounds 9.95, medium, Pounds 14.95 and large, Pounds 19.95. On December 5 and 6, from 11 am to 5 pm (admission Pounds 2.50) the Richmond Fellowship's annual crafts fair will be held at Peacock House, 8 Addison Road, Kensington, London W14 8DL - all proceeds to the fellowship which helps rehabilitate the mentally ill. Thousands of hand-made items will be on sale  -everything from food to jewellery. Hand-painted original glass FUNKY STUFF is the place for wild and whacky glass, all hand-painted, all original, all the work of two young designers, Emma Kennedy and Cathy Ashley. The pair started by finding what they describe as 'the perfect champagne flute' (photographed above) and then experimented in techniques for painting on glass. Now they paint anything from glass-topped tables to original perfume bottles. There are vases and jugs, tumblers and goblets, all can be painted to order and prices vary from Pounds 29 for a champagne flute to Pounds 45 for a large vase. Funky Stuff is at 637 Fulham Road, London SW6. Mary Fellows designs and makes original ceramics in an equally irreverent, colourful mode. Her work seems inspired by Mexican crafts. She decorates things such as candelabra, mirrors, clocks, lamps and jewellery with her sunny decorative themes. Candlesticks start at Pounds 9, a double one at Pounds 13, a clock is Pounds 95, while mirrors range from about Pounds 30 - Pounds 40. See and buy her work at Unit B4 &amp; B5, The Wren Centre, Hampshire Farm, Westbourne Road, Emsworth, Hampshire or tel: 0243-370111 for a mail order leaflet. Turning to the wood craft folk THOSE IN the Sussex area or prepared to make the journey to Lewes, will find some truly beautiful work at 14 Star Brewery Workshops, Castle Ditch Lane, Lewes, East Sussex. There, a clutch of crafts people have workshops as well as a gallery from which they sell unique pieces. Open every day from Tuesday to Saturday, from 10.30am to 6pm, craftspeople will be holding open house today, showing exactly how they produce their wares. Rose-Marie Yeh is a wood turner who makes marvellous decorative bowls, such as the one photographed left, crafted from spalted beech (Pounds 60). She also produces some wonderfully original boxes, hand-carved from redwood, at prices that start at Pounds 30. David Weeks recycles glass to produce some stunning coloured lead crystal, candlesticks, glasses, goblets, bowls, vases and jugs. A triple rim bowl, in Delft blue, lapis blue and violet is just Pounds 28. Mo Hamid sells her hand-thrown stoneware pottery, much of it using blue and white glazes, influenced by Islamic Art, Continental Majolica and Dutch Delftware. A tiny jug, 5in high, is just Pounds 5.90. Wine with a birthday twist I ALWAYS feel that it is a great pity that around about now our old friend, The Man Who Has Everything, seems to get the very best of the presents while the the poor chap who has precious little and who probably needs some serious cheering-up gets the left-overs. So here is an idea for He Who Has Had A Lousy Year or for He Who Deserves it  -a bottle of finest vintage wine to coincide with the year of his birth. Stephen Williams, whose brainchild the Antique Wine Company is, has been collecting vintage wines from houses such as Latour, Pauillac, Petrus, and Cantenac-Brown for many a long year. So far has never been stumped. He has already supplied individual bottles from vintages as far back as 1901 to customers all over the world. Anybody broaching the idea ought to give Stephen Williams a ring first, give him the year and then discuss with him the options and the prices. Prices will vary according to the finesse of the wine, its age and rarity. Stephen Williams pays great attention, too, to how well it has been stored and cared for in the years since it was made. Tasting notes can be supplied with the wines for those who are interested. The wines are all seriously fine and frequently rare so prices are not cheap  -you would need to think in terms of spending somewhere between Pounds 170 and Pounds 500. The wine comes in an important-looking box accompanied by a copy of The Times of the exact day of the birthday, wedding anniversary, or other celebration you choose. A splendid present for a real wine buff. For the full wine list and further details write to The Antique Wine Company, PO 19 Albert Road, Tamworth, Staffordshire, B79 TJN. Tel: 0827-64174. If wine is not his scene, give him a special day out - Red Letter Days will organise anything from a day's rally driving or microlighting to a bungee jump or a day at a health spa. You could give a one-day cooking course, a trip to the theatre, a lesson in anything from falconry to golf and target shooting. Prices range from Pounds 25 to more than Pounds 500, the recipient chooses days to suit himself and the present arrives in the form of a Red Letter pack with details of the present, how to take it up and even the option of changing it for another of the 200 different experiences on offer. For the catalogue of ideas write to Red Letter Days, Freepost, London N12 ORG. Tel: 081-343-8822. Travelling in good order THE TRAVELLING Companion range sports a limited collection of attractive, useful travelling bags designed to bring order and tranquillity to the most disordered of packers. There are some 14 different designs, some - like the collection photographed here - aimed specifically for men, others aimed at women. For Him there are broad stripes in burgundy and white or navy and white and the bags include designs to take shirts, shoes, socks, boxer shorts, slippers (comes complete with a pair of slippers) and laundry. The briefcase packer, seen here, is designed to hold a shirt, tie, pair of socks and boxer short and fit neatly into a standard-size briefcase. For Her the fabric is also striped cotton sateen but this time in pink and white or ivory and white and the range includes bags for stockings and tights, lingerie, brushes and combs, shoes and hair accessories. Designed by Jenny Mort of Mort Sellars Designs, The Guardship, Church Street, Chiswick, London W4 2PH (tel: 081-995-0023) the range can be seen in the toiletries department in Harrods, other stockists from Mort Sellars Designs. Prices range from Pounds 14.50 for a brush and comb bag to Pounds 25.95 for a briefcase packer. A certain animal attraction . . . A READY-FRAMED picture is one of the nicest of presents. For those whose tastes run to the nostalgic and traditional, Martin Wiscombe has produced a limited edition of 150 prints of three animal portraits painted originally by himself in the manner of 18th century English naive art. These were the sort of animal portraits of prize stock usually done as a record for the gentry and farmers in the 18th and 19th centuries. Martin Wiscombe goes to immense trouble to ensure that the finished product looks authentically aged - he paints in oils and acrylics on wood, finishes the painting with several layers of an ageing varnish, then finally crackle glazes them. All the frames are hand-painted and finished with gold-leaf. Choose from The Gloucester Old Spot Pig, The Shropshire Ram (photographed above) or The Shorthorn Steer. Each is Pounds 55, including the frame, postage and packing (three cost Pounds 145) and are available direct from handmade in Wiltshire, Allington House, Allington, Devizes, Wiltshire SN10 3NN.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, June 25 KYODO -- The administration of  President Bill Clinton expressed regret Saturday [25 June] over  Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's announcement of  resignation but said Washington will maintain a close working  relationship with Tokyo.    "We regret the decision," White House Spokeswoman Dee Dee  Myers said in a statement, referring to the disbandment of the  two-month-old minority government earlier in the day.    "President Clinton and Prime Minister Hata enjoyed a good  working relationship," Myers said. "The United States will  continue to work closely with the government of Japan as only  allies and friends can at a moment of political change."    Hata's Cabinet resigned en bloc to pave the way for a new  coalition with majority support rather than calling a snap  general election.    Hata will stay in office at the head of a caretaker  administration until a new government is formed.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: Reports by </F> diplomatic correspondents Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy and  others]    [Text] In response to INTERFAX's question on whether  agreement on the merger of the Russian and Belarusian monetary  systems translated into a move toward a confederation of the two  republics, Belarusian Foreign Minister Piotr Krawchanka said  existing legal regulations were what counted most at this stage.    The Belarusian constitution provided for the existence of a  National Bank and, Krawchanka said, before the Belarusian  parliament moved to amend the fundamental law, the idea of a  merger would have a hard time in Belarus. But, let's not put  the cart before the horse, he said, it was yet difficult to say  how exactly the merger agreement would work.    The removal of the first problems on the road for the  effective realization of Russian and Belarusian economic plans  was what counted most and spelled a big success for the  Belarusian Cabinet and its Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich,  Krawchanka said.</p>

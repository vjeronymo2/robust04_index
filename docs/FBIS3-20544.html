On the surface, it appears that the price level in  China will fall, but because of changes in the import-export  mechanism and various other reasons, China's overall price level  will not only not fall but possibly rise. Generally speaking,  the following several factors will have an effect:    1. The effect of exchange rate changes. Several times since  1985, China has lowered the exchange rate between the renminbi  and the United States dollar, but the official exchange rate  today still overestimates the value of the renminbi. In  addition, with the institution of strict foreign exchange  control whereby the renminbi cannot be freely exchanged, the  renminbi will be devalued. The reasons are as follows: First, as  price reform intensifies and the pace quickens, domestic prices  will enter a period of fairly high rise during which the  national price index will increase several percentage points  each year. Second, with the development of China's commodity  economy, the determination of the prices of goods by the laws of  value is bound to rupture the existing price system. Tremendous  changes will occur that will cause a rise in prices resulting in  an absolute decline in the existing monetary value of the  renminbi. This will produce a devaluation of the renminbi  relative to foreign currencies. Third, as trade protection  weakens, imports will increase fairly rapidly in the short term  causing an increase in domestic demand for foreign exchange,  which will cause a rise in the exchange rate. Thus, the renminbi  value of imports will rise. Clearly, a lowering of the renminbi  exchange rate will cause a rise in the price index on the one  hand, and a rise in the price index will spur a further lowering  of the renminbi exchange rate on the other. Therefore, following  China's re-entry into GATT, changes in the exchange rate will  cause a rise in the domestic price level.    2. The effect of the transfer of international inflation.  The  meshing of China's economy with the international economy is an  objective requirement for China's re-entry to GATT. As a result  of foreign trade, foreign debt, and exchange rate devaluation,  international inflation can be shifted to China. Conversely,  because the renminbi cannot leave China, domestic inflation  cannot be shifted to the international economy. Therefore, in  the process of opening to the outside world, we will sustain  pressure from both domestic inflation and the transfer of  international inflation. Because of this double inflation,  China's price level is bound to rise.    3. The effect of total supply and demand. Following re-entry  into GATT, international factors will have to be added into  China's total supply and demand balance. The former balance will  be destroyed. On the supply side, numerous foreign products that  enjoy marked superiority in quality and price will enter China  directly. At the same time, large amounts of some Chinese  resources and preliminarily processed raw materials will flow to  foreign countries because of their cheap price. On the demand  side, as Chinese incomes increase fairly rapidly and  restrictions on income soften, the demand for high quality  consumer goods (such as motor vehicles) will be virtually  unlimited. Because imports of foreign goods are restricted in  various ways at the present time, citizen consumption demand is  held down by the structural dislocations between supply and  demand; thus, supply and demand are in relative balance for the  time being. But just as soon as the regulation of imports  demolishes the structural restraints on the supply and demand  structure, people's consumption will begin to be stimulated. As  a result, current latent demand will become real demand.  Moreover, since consumption accounts for two-thirds of total  demand, the fairly rapid growth of consumption demand is bound  to stimulate growth of total demand, thereby affecting the  overall price level.    4. The effect of tariffs. In the course of multilateral  negotiations with GATT signatory nations, China promised to  reduce tariffs. China believes that a lowering of tariffs will  lower prices of imports, thereby lowering the overall price  level. A World Bank report believes that China's actual tariff  rate is between 5 and 6 percent, which is close to the developed  country level and lower than the developing country level.  Therefore, following re-entry to GATT, China's actual overall  tariff level will not change very much.  <H5>  Effect on Agricultural Product Prices </H5>   1) Advantages    The GATT provides favorable conditions for accelerating the  opening to the outside world of China's agriculture, and for  linking China's agricultural production with the world  agricultural products market. It helps introduce new varieties,  and new techniques and management experiences to transform  traditional agriculture, to promote advances in China's  agricultural techniques, and to increase the modernization of  China's agriculture. It enables China to enjoy fairly consistent  most favored nation treatment, and it expands exports of China's  agricultural products, particularly processed agricultural  products. China can make full use of the GATT negotiating  mechanism to link up with developing countries concerned in  opposing the agricultural trade barriers and the export subsidy  policies of developed countries in order to safeguard the  interests of developing countries. China can make use of foreign  experiences and GATT mechanisms to give impetus to thorough  reform of agriculture that promotes the smooth transformation of  China's agriculture from a planned economy to a socialist market  economy.    2) Disadvantages    The lowering of agricultural product tariffs and the  reduction of non-tariff production measures means that China's  principal agricultural products will face strong quality and  price competition from foreign products.    1. Farming    During the past decade, agricultural production costs in  China have increased by an average 10 percent per year. Prices  of some products are higher than the international market price.  Many agricultural products have lost their competitive price  advantage. Once China returns to GATT, its farm production  --particularly grain production -- will face extremely daunting  challenges.    2. Animal Husbandry    It is well known that under today's import control system  and at today's tariff rates, China's wool production frequently  receives a pounding from the international market. In 1984 and  in 1988, for example, China-produced wool accumulated in  inventory for 2 to 3 years because too much wool was imported.  This had an extremely adverse effect on the economic development  of border areas and the normal life of peasants and herdsmen.  Between 1989 and 1991, the annual per capita income of Inner  Mongolian herdsmen was 201 yuan less than in normal years.  Following China's re-entry to GATT, if tariff rates are further  greatly lowered and license control is abolished, imports will  further increase making maintenance of domestic wool production  difficult. Milk and dairy products production also face  challenges from foreign products. Today, prices of Chinese  produced dairy products are higher than the international market  price, largely because yields per milk cow are low and costs are  high. In China today, 68 percent of all cows are low yield cows  that product 5 tons or less per year. Second, processing scale  returns are poor. Most of the country's dairy products  processing plants have a fresh milk processing capacity of under  20 tons per day. No scale production capacity has been built,  products are undiversified, and the labor productivity rate is  low. Among imported dairy products, whole fat milk power poses a  substantial threat.    3. Aquatic Products    Following GATT re-entry, China's aquatic products industry  will also face some problems and challenges. One relates to  prawns. China is the largest producer and the foremost exporter  of prawns. Because of the rise in production costs in recent  years, costs now approximate, or are slightly higher than in the  prawn producing countries of southeast Asia. If import tariffs  are too low, southeast Asian prawns may take over China's  markets because their quality is good and sale prices are  flexible. Second, once tariffs are lowered, imports of marine  fish will increase and prices will fall. This may damage  freshwater fish production.  <H5>  Effect on Electronics Industry Products </H5>   Positive Advantages    1. GATT re-entry will create a domestic and international  climate helpful to the development of China's electronics  industry and hasten its internationalization.    a. It will help improve the domestic economic environment.  In  the operation of China's economy today, as formerly, the  government controls the economy through the use of command plans  and guidance plans. Government control of enterprises behavior  is stifling. The role of the market mechanism in regulating  enterprises behavior is insufficient. In addition, parochialism  in industries and local protectionism split markets that were  not intact to begin with the result that market behavior and the  market mechanism in China today does not conform to GATT  regulations. However, these regulations have been universally  accepted by other countries. In order for China to revive its  GATT signatory nation status, it must accept generally  acknowledged international norms. This requires that China  further intensify economic system reforms, demolish the old  control system, and build a new administrative system and new  market mechanism that meets the requirements of a socialist  market economy. It requires elimination of excessive  administrative meddling with enterprise behavior, elimination of  local and industrial sector protectionism, full use of the  market mechanism, establishment of the proper position of  enterprises in the market, and accelerated formation of a  nationwide unified market. Only in this way can our enterprises  have a fair and competitive environment on which they can rely  for their survival and development.    b. China's environment for electronics exports will improve  substantially. Following GATT restitution, we can enjoy steady,  multilateral most favored nation treatment. We can further free  ourselves from the economic control of developed nations.  Applicable GATT tariff protection principles may be used to  counter the non-tariff barriers that some countries have set up  against China's export of electronics products. As the volume of  China's electronics exports has increased in recent years, some  rampantly protectionist developed countries have invoked  anti-dumping controls against China's electronics product  exports. Once China re-enters GATT, it will be able to rely on  applicable GATT tariff protection principles to counter improper  foreign anti-dumping, and anti-subsidy sanctions for a gradual  elimination of such discriminatory trade behavior, and avoidance  of the unfairness and arbitrariness of unilateral sanctions  based on importing countries anti-dumping and anti-subsidy laws.  GATT principles of free trade provide that protection of the  indigenous industry of all signatory nations is limited to  tariffs. Signatory nations have an obligation to abolish import  quantity restrictions, import subsidies, and such non-tariff  barriers. Thus, the non-tariff barriers of certain countries  against China's electronics products will decrease to a certain  extent once China re-enters GATT.    2. Full enjoyment of the favored treatment that GATT accords  developing countries.    China is still a developing country; thus, it may make full  use of GATT exception clauses that pertain to developing  countries. It can enjoy the favored treatment that GATT accords  developing countries such as greater elasticity in the tariff  system of developing countries, permitting subsidies within  certain limits, enjoyment of general preferential treatment,  etc. These clauses are favorable for China's making the most of  its own advantages, for turning its strengths to advantage and  avoiding weaknesses, and for expanding exports once it has  returned to GATT. Specifically, China's electronics industry can  use the tariff system provisions (such as developing countries  not making any countervailing tariff reduction or preferential  provisions for developed countries) for fairly flexible handling  of tariffs on the products of China's electronics industry,  thereby gaining a certain degree of protection for China's  fledgling and incompletely competitive industries.    3. Acceleration of the internationalization of China's  electronics industry.    GATT re-entry means a meshing of the domestic market with  international markets, the domestic market becoming an integral  part of the international market. China's electronics industry  must orient toward both the domestic and the international  market. Macroeconomically speaking, China must put in place an  operating mechanism for the transformation of enterprises,  effectively control the economy as a whole, improve analysis of  the domestic and foreign economic situations, analyze market  price prognostications, readjust tax policy, credit policy,  income policy, and exchange rate policy in a timely fashion, and  maintain general balance between total social supply and demand  so that price formation and operation are consistent with  economic development. China must use effectively and rationally  domestic and foreign sources of materials, become a part of the  modern economic development tide of an international division of  labor, and join the ranks of international competition. Like it  or not, our enterprises have no other choice. They can either  seek survival and development through competition, or they can  lose and collapse through competition. This international  competition provides both motivation and pressure. This is the  only way to spur enterprises to transform their operating  mechanisms, to improve internal administration, to raise labor  productivity rates, to strive to lower product costs, to engage  in constant technological transformation, to update technology  and develop new products, to actively adjust their product mix,  to improve product quality steadily, and to realize the  economies of scale. We must master the international market, and  actively take part in international competition as the only way  to develop our electronics industry.    4. GATT re-entry will permit China to take part in the  drawing up of regulations pertaining to international trade; it  will help China draw up economic regulations suited to its  reform and opening to the outside world, new circumstances, and  international practice.    Since we are not yet a GATT member, our specific national  circumstances cannot be reflected in GATT international trade  regulations. We can only passively accept GATT regulations on  international trade. Consequently, China's electronics exports  are frequently treated unfairly. They are unfairly restricted,  proscribed, and even excluded by numerous non-tariff barriers.  Once China's GATT signatory nation status has been restored, we  can participate directly in drafting and discussing the GATT  regulations that play a major role in international trade. This  will enable China to express its intentions and have them made a  part of GATT regulations. This will mean that. like other  members, China can enjoy and observe GATT regulations as an  equal, avoiding the discrimination that comes with not being a  member.    China's participation in GATT will have a definite effect on  the drafting and perfection of its laws and regulations  pertaining to the economy, trade, and finance and banking. Some  new laws and regulations that are in keeping with international  practice and norms will have to be drawn up, and existing laws  and regulations will have to be further improved to make Chinese  economic life a part of the legal system while maintaining  China's distinctive socialist market economy.    5. GATT entry will help resolve trade disputes.    GATT is an international body having a mechanism for  resolving multilateral trade disputes. It is an authoritative  arena for the resolution of international trade arguments. Since  China followed a policy of isolation and self-containment for so  long, since economic reform and opening to the outside world has  taken place only during the past 10-odd years, and since China  is not a GATT member, it is still not thoroughly conversant with  the trade regulations of some GATT signatory nations. The  arguments and disputes of recent years over China's electronics  product export trade have usually been attributable to this.  This puts China in an unfavorable position for resolving and  handling disputes, and thus it has paid an unnecessary price in  some cases. However, each year GATT has to deal with many trade  disputes. While upholding the just rights and interests of  signatory nations, it effectively handles trade disputes verging  on conflict from all quarters. Following GATT re-entry, China  can place itself under the multilateral trade protection  principles that all signatory nations acknowledge. It can avail  itself of GATT's dispute resolution mechanism, thereby improving  its bargaining position in the resolution of trade disputes  among signatory nations. It will be able more effectively to  discuss and negotiate solution to disputes with its trading  partners using the maintenance of GATT principles as a basis.  When necessary, it can fairly resolve issues through GATT's  mediation, thereby improving treatment for China's electronics  products export trade to safeguard the national interest.    6. GATT re-entry will mean fairly easy access to full  information about the world economy and trade.    GATT has information about the world economy and trade. As a  signatory nation, China can use this GATT window to obtain  documents from which it can gain an understanding of the trade  regulations, trade policies, trade statistics, and trends of  development in trade of other signatory nations. This will help  China decide trade development strategies and draw up rational  trade laws and regulations. It will also enhance information  exchanges with other countries. For electronics products, in  particular, which are updated extremely rapidly and in which  competition is extremely intense, timely understanding of  international market product trends and market movements holds  extremely important significance for China's long-term trade  strategy and the setting of near-term goals.    7. GATT participation will further help attract foreign  capital, and bring in sophisticated technology and management  experience.    Following GATT re-entry, as China's markets mesh with  international markets to become an integral part of the  international market, our products will be able to leave and  enter the international market, and we will be able to acquire  some sophisticated technology and sales techniques from foreign  countries. In addition, the more roomy domestic market climate  will also further attract foreign trader investment and the  operation of enterprises in China. Investment in the electronics  industry, in particular, will increase, and with it will come  fairly sophisticated technology and management experience.  <H5>  Negative Disadvantages </H5>   Recovery of GATT signatory nation status will have a very  severe near-term impact on China's electronics markets. Intense  competition may put some enterprises in dire straits. Some  enterprises that produce low quality, not readily saleable  products will lose out in competition, will lose their markets  entirely, and will face the prospect of halting production,  going out of business, merging, or shifting to other lines of  production.    Following GATT re-entry, while enjoying rights as a member,  China will also have to perform corresponding duties. As China's  electronics products enter international markets, whether we  greatly reduce tariffs or provide "market promises" as the  "admittance fee" for GATT re-entry, the domestic electronics  products market will become an integral part of the  international market. Thus, China will lose its "protective  umbrella" to stand completely naked in international markets.  This will pose a grim test for China's electronics industry.    1. High and new technology industries that are just getting  started will face grim challenges, and industries in their  infancy will find their development threatened. High and new  technology businesses in China's electronics industry are in a  nascent stage. They do not have the ability to compete with  similar foreign products in terms of product quality, technical  performance, or price. We must clearly realize that in their  overall level, China's electronics products cannot compete with  sophisticated products from the United States, Japan, and  Europe. They will even find sales competition with similar  products from Asia's "four small dragons" difficult. Unless  China's electronics industry is properly protected, foreign  goods will overwhelm its electronics products markets facing  China's industrial enterprises will a further predicament.    2. Many years of narrow sectarianism and local  protectionism,  failure to keep in mind the nation's overall interests, and much  mindless redundant imports and construction have produced two  consequences: One is the waste of a large amount of money,  materials, and manpower; and the other is that excess production  capacity for the same items resulted in none of the enterprises  producing the same product being able to keep fully employed.  Thus, they could not realize the economies of scale, found it  difficult to hold down costs, and were unable to fashion a  certain amount of international competitiveness. If premium  quality, low priced foreign goods come flooding in on top of  this, without government protection, some enterprises producing  low quality products will face the danger of being eliminated  when faced with the onslaught of foreign products because their  technology is antiquated, the management is inept, their product  quality is poor, and their economic returns are low.    3. Electronics products, which cannot compete on price and  quality, will lose the protection they now enjoy when the  domestic market is opened up. They face the danger of being  wiped out. For a long time, China has accorded both tariff and  non-tariff protection to electronics products. This kept out  imports to protect markets. At the same time, however, it  protected backward industries and obstructed competition.  Ultimately this caused a loss of both money and human resources.  Some low technology, poor quality enterprises had to rely on a  distorted market price system. They depended on the government's  protective umbrella for their survival. Even so, some  enterprises still showed a loss. However, some technologically  strong and well-run enterprises, and some enterprises whose  product quality and prices were superior could not update their  equipment because of unfair market competition, and government  policies that penalized frontrunners. They lacked sufficient  reserve strength, and thus could not become strongly competitive.  <H5>  The Effect on the Textile Industry </H5>   GATT re-entry will open opportunities for the textile  industry.    1. The international climate for textile product exports  will  improve.    International competition in textiles is currently very  intense. Trade protectionism by all countries is very severe.  Currently, China's foreign trade is conducted through bilateral  negotiations. Since textile exports are frequently limited by  various tariff and non-tariff barriers in developed countries,  China's exports are at a competitive disadvantage  internationally. For example, the United States pressures China  with most favored nation treatment, and it employs the "301"  provisions to retaliate against China's textile exports.  Following GATT restoration, in principle, China will  unconditionally enjoy most favored nation treatment. All trade  barriers will be greatly reduced; trade among signatory nations  will become freer; and the international climate for China's  textile exports will improve.    2. GATT re-entry will set the stage for textiles to open new  markets.    Most of China's textile exports today go to Hong Kong,  Japan,  the EC and the United States. Exports to these countries and  territories account for the lion's share of all of China's  textile exports. Relatively speaking, future potential is not  very great for the expansion of textile product exports in these  main sales markets. United States Department of Commerce  Statistics show that China has become the largest supplier of  textiles to the United States, accounting for 13.9 percent of  the total. It ranks second in money terms at 12.6 percent. In  1990, China ranked third as a supplier of textiles to the EC.  Therefore, expansion of China's textile exports will require  great efforts to open markets in other countries and  territories. GATT re-entry provides the possibility of opening a  new, more diversified, multilateral trade pattern for China's  textiles.    3. Portion of China's textile exports may increase.    During the period of transition from the Multi-Fiber  Arrangement [MFA] to GATT integration, the accompanying quotas  on kinds and percentages will be gradually abolished, and  surplus textile allocations will gradually increase. The  year-by-year percentage increase in allocations according to  provisions of the new agreement will be 16 percent between 1993  and 1995, 25 percent between 1996 and 1999, and 27 percent  between 2000 and 2002. At this rate, the actual allocation will  increase 1.3-fold within 10 years. Thus, following GATT  re-entry, China should enjoy the benefit of a gradual increase  in its textile and clothing quota. It must be noted that this is  a theoretically calculated rate of increase. Numerous factors  affect export growth, and they must be completely analyzed to  make a scientific prediction. Actual quota increase can also  only be obtained through intense market competition.    In addition, the new agreement also provides for integration  of 12 percent of textile imports between 1993 and 1995,  integration of 17 percent between 1996 and 1999, and integration  of 18 percent between 2000 and 2002. China may compete equally  with other signatory nations in the integrated textiles and  clothing trade. This will also provide China an opportunity to  expand textile exports.    4. The 10-year MFA transition period provides conditions for  readjustment of China's textile industry and wins time for  technological transformation.    During the textiles and clothing export trade integration  process, fierce competition will occur in the world textile  market. The key to successful competition lies in the  technological transformation of the textile industry. Ability to  apply high technology to the production of high quality, high  grade, high added value products is decisive in competing  successfully. At the present time, the technological level of  China's textile industry lags far behind that of developed  countries and territories. Top priority matters include  transformation of enterprises' operating mechanisms, orienting  toward domestic and international markets, readjusting the  industrial structure and the product mix, spurring technical  progress, and accelerating technological transformation.  However, these things require a process of development. The MFA  to GATT 10 year transition period provides conditions for  China's textile industry to adjust and gain time for  transformation.    The above opportunities are premised on solution to GATT  re-entry problems. Since the developed countries of Europe and  America insist that the Uruguay round (including textiles and  clothing) is a total agreement, only GATT signatory nations  having the right to take part in textile and clothing  transitional plans, this means that this plan applies only to  signatory nations within GATT. Currently, 116 countries and  territories are full participants in the Uruguay round of  multilateral trade negotiations. China is one of them. Once  China rejoins GATT, it will automatically enjoy the rights  stipulated in the Uruguay round of negotiations, and it will  also be responsible for discharging attendant obligations.  Unless China is able to achieve restoration of its signatory  status before conclusion of the Uruguay round of negotiations,  China's textile and clothing exports will continue to be limited  to what can be accomplished through bilateral negotiations. They  will be limited by quotas. China has already expressed  willingness to sign the complete Uruguay round accord. It is  hoped that the negotiations will conclude shortly in order to  promote growth of the world economy and trade. This also  explains the necessity and urgency for China's GATT re-entry.    Of course, immediately following GATT re-entry, especially  within a short period, China will have to gradually eliminate  import licensing and substantially reduce tariffs; however,  poorly competitive businesses and firms in the textile industry  will face substantial pressures and threats. The main such  trades are as follows:    1. China began to build its chemical fiber industries during  the 1960s. Thanks to more than 30 years development, a complete  range of such industries has been fashioned. Some fairly large  size industries exist. In 1991, China ranked third in the world  in chemical fiber production capacity. Conspicuous problems  today are the small scale of China's chemical fiber industry,  scattered plant sites, numerous production links, many tax  rates, fairly antiquated equipment, low labor productivity  rates, fairly high costs, not very high product grades, numerous  ordinary products, few products meeting special specifications,  prices that are higher than in international markets, and lack  of competitiveness. Following China's GATT re-entry, the first  textile industry to be hurt will be the chemical fiber industry.  With the elimination of licenses and the lowering of tariffs,  polyester producing enterprises will face losses, the returns of  dacron short fiber enterprises will decline further, and new  polyester and acrylic fiber plants will be hard hit.    2. Long chemical fiber textiles. During the past several  years, China has developed the production of silk-like chemical  fiber textiles on a large scale, but in 1991, large amounts of  silk-like chemical fiber textiles were still being imported  because China could not compete with foreign products on variety  or quality, and particularly on price. Once China re-enters  GATT, this kind of silk-like chemical fiber will be even harder  hit.    3. China's dyeing industry today is not of a proper scale or  composition, varieties are few, lots are large, quality and  grade are not high, and returns are poor. It does not meet  international needs for "small lots, many varieties, and quick  delivery." Currently, China's self-sufficiency rate in export  clothing lining is fairly low, and the quantity and quality of  high grade sanforized products cannot meet domestic clothing  industry demand. Much must still be imported. When tariffs are  lowered and markets are opened following GATT re-entry, foreign  textiles and clothing will enter the domestic consumer market at  once. China's dyeing industry will face intense competition and  a serious pounding.  <H5>  Effect on Iron and Steel Product Prices </H5>   1. The price formation mechanism. After 15 years of reform,  China's iron and steel products price control system has  changed. Enterprises rather than the state now set prices. This  is basically consistent with the market pricing mechanism that  GATT requires. However, China's iron and steel products price  formation system differs in certain ways from the market system  that western countries practice. 2. The iron and steel product  price level. Overall, because they are currently pulled by  demand, prices of iron and steel products in China are the same  or greater than the international market price. For example, the  domestic market price for popular goods such as wire rods and  steel plate is greater than the international market FOB price.  For a time, it was greater than the delivered cost of imported  steel. Consequently, since 1993 large quantities of processed  steel and scrap steel have been imported.    The effect of GATT re-entry on China's steel products price  levels will be as follows: 1. It will restrict domestic finished  steel market price levels, thereby causing a slide in the price  of finished steel products that exceed the delivered cost.  Second, most Chinese-produced iron and steel products are less  diversified and of poorer quality that the same kinds of  products on the international market. This means that, generally  speaking, prices of Chinese-produced iron and steel products  will be lower than prices of imports.    In addition, following GATT re-entry, prices of production  elements such as railroad transportation, electric power and  coal will rise substantially, thereby increasing iron and steel  product production costs. This will affect the overall price  level of iron and steel products, and the price structure  between different products.  <H5>  Effect on Cement Prices </H5>   Analysis of the effect of GATT re-entry on cement prices in  China, and study of remedies that may be taken requires, first  of all, a clarification of the advantages and shortcoming of  China's cement industry in a free market. Advantages and  disadvantages are comparative. Thus, one cannot generalize. One  must make accurate comparisons. Many trades study the effect on  domestic industry of GATT re-entry by comparing China's  advantages and disadvantages in comparison with their main  competitors, the developed nations of Europe and America. Such  comparisons are correct, no doubt, but we feel that Chinese  cement cannot be compared with cement in Europe and America.  This is because many years practice show that we import very  little cement from Europe and America, and we will not import  much in the future. China exports very little cement to either  Europe or the United States today, but the amount may increase  in the future. However, a long development process will be  required. The Chinese cement industry's main foreign trade  competitors are Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Indonesia,  Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore. Our main comparative  advantages over these countries and territories are as follows:    1) Manpower advantage. China's wage level is only one-tenth  or less of theirs. The cement industry is a labor and capital  intensive industry. To a very large extent, the cost of labor  decides product competitiveness. Rise in the price of a nation's  labor cannot arbitrarily exceed the overall level of its  economic development. Therefore, the manpower advantage that  China's cement industry enjoy is not just for the present, but  will continue for a very long time.    2) Energy and raw materials advantage. The cement industry  is  a high energy consumption industry, and it requires large  amounts of non-metallic raw materials such as limestone. By  comparison with competitors, China has plentiful reserves of  energy, particularly coal, and raw materials such as limestone,  which are found over a wide area. China is richly endowed by  nature, and prices are relatively cheap.    3) Environmental protection pressures are relatively slight.  Since the cement industry is a traditional industry that  pollutes the environment to a certain extent and whose  technology content is fairly low, during the 1980s, some  developed countries and territories began to limit its  development or relocation. For example, Japan and Singapore  adopted such measures. Relatively speaking, pressures in these  regards are not great in China.    4) Transportation and sales advantage. The cement trade is  strongly dependent on transportation. Cement must be marketed  within a certain radius. Currently, some competitors are able to  compete with us in sea transportation; thus, they have entered  some coastal areas. However, they will find it difficult to  compete with domestic firms in shipping cement long distances  into vast inland markets.    Relatively speaking, China's cement industry is at a  disadvantage in the following respects:    1) The general level of production technology is not high.  Most Chinese cement concerns are medium and small enterprises  most of whose equipment is antiquated and whose technical  strength is weak. Consequently, they lag behind foreign  countries in product quality, variety, and resources  utilization. In particular, the variety and character of the  cement they produce lacks diversity. It does not meet the  construction industry's development needs.    2) Plant size is relatively small. Only one in 100 plants  are  of large or medium size. This percentage is far lower than for  Japan and South Korea, and even lower than for Indonesia and  Thailand. Failure to increase the benefits of scale is bound to  increase difficulties in lowering costs.    3) A not entirely rational dispersal of the industry, and  poorly developed transportation means that cement is in short  supply in some coastal areas where much cement is used, while  supply is greater than demand in inland areas. This affords  opportunities for imported cement.    4) Psychological effect. Chinese prefer foreign goods not  just for technological or quality reasons, but for psychological  reasons as well. In Guangdong and Fujian provinces, the demand  of capital construction projects for cement has increased in  recent years, but some projects would rather use high priced  imported cement than low priced inland China cement. One  important reason for this is greater confidence about the  quality of imported cement and that contracts will be honored.    Ultimately, all of the foregoing factors are reflected in  price. In accordance with the principles of free trade that GATT  follows, following GATT re-entry domestic and foreign firms will  compete on equal conditions. Survival of the fittest will depend  on quality, price, and sales service. China's advantage in  future development lies in price, which it will continue to  maintain. Its disadvantage lies in development problems, which  efforts are being made to solve. Therefore, prospects are fairly  optimistic.  <H5>  Effect on Export Prices </H5>   Following GATT re-entry, China's commodity export trade  climate will improve greatly. Applicable GATT provisions will  provide forable conditions and effective protection for China's  exports. They will provide China vast export opportunities  manifested in the following specific ways:    1. Following GATT re-entry, in accordance with the most  favored nation treatment provisions and the general preference  system principles, China will enjoy tremendous tariff  concessions from GATT member states. During the past more than  40 years, all member nations have conducted tariff concession  discussions under GATT auspices, the tariff level of developed  nations falling from 50 to 4.7 percent. The tariff level of  developing countries has also fallen commensurately to 13.5  percent. Once China is a GATT member, more of its export  commodities will enjoy preferential tariffs to a greater degree,  and no longer will there be general tariffs. There is a wide gap  between preferential tariff rates and general tariff rates;  thus, this will greatly increase the price competitiveness of  China's exports. This will mean that China's low cost and low  price advantages can be more fully exploited. It will also lower  export costs, improve export returns, and stimulate export  growth, providing opportunities for exports that could not  otherwise be exported because of overly high tariffs. This will  enable more of China's goods to enter international markets.    2. Following GATT re-entry, China will receive most favored  nation treatment from more countries and territories. Thus, its  export channels will increase, and its export area will expand.  At present, China's export area is relatively concentrated. Only  21 countries and territories provide general preference system  treatment to China. Once China has re-entered GATT, we can use  the GATT negotiating arena to conduct wideranging talks and  negotiations with nearly 100 GATT member nations. We can use  GATT's most favored nation treatment provisions and general  preference system principles to obtain most favored nation  treatment from more countries and territories. Thus, our goods  can be exported to more countries and regions. Widening of the  market will permit greater latitude in setting prices of China's  exports. We will be able to chose markets over a wider area that  will accept higher priced exports.    3. Consultation, mediation, and resolution of disputes are  the basic tasks of GATT. After restitution of China's signatory  nation status, with the help of GATT's mediation mechanism,  China will be able to use international law as a basis for  impartial resolution of trade disputes, the elimination of  prejudice against China's exports, and improvement of China's  position in trade negotiations. In recent years, some western  nations have used the low prices of China's exports as a pretext  for leveling dumping charges. They have instituted "anti-dumping  investigations" and levied anti-dumping sales taxes that have  caused great losses for China's export trade. Once China's GATT  status has been restored, it will be able to refer such  unreasonable charges to GATT for equitable resolution in  accordance with prescribed procedures. This will ensure the  development of China's foreign trade exports and safeguard  China's economic trade interests.    4. Following GATT re-entry, China can use GATT's information  system to obtain more international trade information and  intelligence. In addition, it can engage in bilateral exchanges  with other GATT signatories for an expansion of economic  information sources and channels. Thus, China will be able to  more frequently, more quickly, and more completely understand  international market development trends, particularly  international market price information. It will be able to  scientifically determine kinds of exports and export price  levels, and to rationally formulate export policy and make price  competition decisions.    Recovery of its GATT seat will provide China's foreign trade  exports excellent opportunities, but it will also pose stricter  requirements. We will have to abide strictly by international  regulations in export practice, and strictly enforce the  provisions of GATT articles. Of all the GATT provisions, the  ones that have the greatest effect on exports are the "dumping  and anti-dumping" and the "subsidy and anti-subsidy" provisions.    Dumping is a form of unfair competition. GATT has provisions  forbidding dumping, and it holds that an anti-dumping sales tax  of a certain amount may be levied on dumped goods. Anti-dumping  has a direct effect on the prices of China's exports. On the one  hand, because of the strict provisions, once China has  re-entered GATT, it will protest our legal rights and regular  exports. It will prevent unreasonable accusations against  China's dumping of goods. On the other hand, it will require  that China's exports be handled strictly according to  international standards. When setting export prices, we will  have to be scientific and reasonable. When a low price is used  to compete, a limit must be set. The price cannot be lower than  normal value (i.e. a price comparable to the one for the same  product consumed in the home country under normal circumstances,  or the highest comparable price for the same product exported to  a third country under normal trading circumstances, or the  production cost plus a reasonable sales expense and profit in  the home country). Since reform and opening to the outside  world, China has frequently been accused of dumping by western  countries. This has occasioned very great losses for China's  export trade. This sounds a warning for China's exports  following GATT re-entry. If an anti-dumping sales tax is levied,  this will not be just a matter of loss or gain from buying and  selling but may well result in the community being blocked from  future exports of that product, which would seriously damage the  development of China's exports.</p>

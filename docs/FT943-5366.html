			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Cuba and US still far apart on ways to halt exodus The US and Cuba failed in a third day of talks yesterday to reach an agreement to halt the exodus of Cuban refugees and the US said 'substantial gaps' separated the two sides, agencies report from New York. 'The differences are significant,' Mr David Johnson, spokesman for the US delegation, said after three hours of talks in the office of the US Mission to the United Nations. Talks will resume today at Cuba's UN mission. Cuba has been reluctant to agree on measures to stem the exodus of refugees to Florida unless the talks are widened to include a relaxation of the 32-year-old US economic embargo on the socialist state. Cuba's chief negotiator at the talks, Mr Ricardo Alarcon, has predicted little progress until the discussions tackle the economic embargo. Before yesterday's round of talks began, Mr Alarcon, Cuba's former foreign minister, insisted that refugees were making the risky crossing of the Florida Straits in flimsy rafts because of hardship caused by the US embargo. The latest flood of Cubans leaving the island began when President Fidel Castro responded to riots in Havana on August 5 by suggesting that his government would no longer stop citizens trying to leave. Since then, more than 28,000 Cubans have tried to reach Florida. President Bill Clinton has tried to stop the flow of refugees arriving illegally by barring them from the US and taking them to US naval base at Guantanamo on the western tip of Cuba. The US has also been seeking other temporary havens in the region for refugees. Panama said yesterday it would let the US house up to 10,000 Cuban refugees in US-controlled territory alongside the Panama Canal. Panama's Foreign Minister Gabriel Lewis Galindo said the refugees could stay in four makeshift tent cities being built by the US military. The US Coast Guard picked up 620 Cubans from rafts at sea by late afternoon yesterday. Saturday's total was 946, down from nearly 1,300 on Friday. In the talks in New York, Washington has proposed putting in place an 'expanded, predictable, dependable and legal' migration programme, provided Cuba takes steps to prevent an illegal, disorganised exodus from the island.</p>

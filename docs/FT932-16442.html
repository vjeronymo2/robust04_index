			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Technology: Sowing the seeds of productivity - Technically Speaking Biotechnology has been greeted in developing countries with as much apprehension as enthusiasm. Pessimists argue that the concentration of biotechnology research and development within commercial companies in rich countries means, at best, that the needs of the poor will be by-passed. Profit-seeking firms will inevitably concentrate on products of most interest to affluent farmers - on new wheat strains or leaner beef, rather than improved millet or cassava, food staples for many rural Africans. Worse, there are fears that biotechnology could make the poor poorer. Research on genetically engineered substitutes for vanilla, coconut oil, cocoa and even coffee could destroy the livelihoods of millions of farmers in the third world, repeating on a far bigger scale the predations of enzyme-produced sweeteners on the world sugar market. Increased production due to higher yields from disease and drought-resistant crops could glut world markets and push down prices - bearable for farmers who can afford to buy the expensive new seeds (and gene-related herbicides) that cut their growing costs, but potentially devastating for those who cannot. Finally, the reduced need for labour to fertilise, weed and spray the fields planted with these new wonder crops could cut rural jobs and incomes, intensifying poverty and accelerating the drift to the overcrowded cities. Weeding especially is a task done mainly by very poor women. However, a review of existing applications of biotechnology in developing countries by the International Labour Organisation* suggests these fears are misplaced. Even today, biotechnology is not exclusively a preserve of the wealthy nations. Many developing countries - from Mexico to Malawi - already have the skills and resources to exploit 'second-generation' techniques based on micro-propagation, which involves producing plantlets from isolated plant cells to yield identical crops. A micro-propagation laboratory to produce cloned plantlets costs perhaps Dollars 250,000 (Pounds 176,000), small beer compared with the millions spent annually by third-world nations on imported chemical fertilisers. Micro-propagation of potatoes in Kenya has doubled land productivity and profitability. China has gone further, developing resistant strains of rice and wheat with remarkable results. In addition, micro-propagation for citrus growing in Mexico and tea planting in Malawi and Kenya actually boosted employment, as more hands were needed for planting, pruning and harvesting the extra crops. Jobs were also created in associated industries - the laboratories producing the plantlets and the factories processing the harvested crops. Biologically-crafted crop strains also have big potential advantages for small, poor farmers, the ILO argues. Unlike their conventionally-bred Green Revolution counterparts, these strains do not require extra inputs such as water and fertiliser to realise better yields. On the contrary, they cut costs, save on resources, reduce the risk of crop loss and failure and, by improving storage qualities, may help small farmers bring their produce to market. In theory, the benefits of biotechnology should thus be shared more equitably. To make sure that they are, countries need to adopt policies that encourage wide and speedy diffusion of biotechnology while limiting its adverse effects. The ILO argues that fair patent rules and greater competition between suppliers would help keep prices down and broaden access. It also urges rich countries to scrap trade barriers to commodity imports that artificially stimulate work on substitutes and discourage research on new end-uses. Poor countries, it says, should do more to reduce rural inequalities and to promote adjustment to the new technology, which holds out the prospect of a more productive, efficient and greener farm sector. *Biotechnology: A hope or a threat?

			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / TGWU seeks to broaden its appeal THE TGWU general union is hoping to broaden its appeal by offering a range of welfare and counselling services to members, former members, and even non-members, Mr Bill Morris, the general secretary, said yesterday. Prior to next week's union conference - which is held every two years - Mr Morris said that the union needed a 'twin-track' strategy of improving collective bargaining services for those in unionised workplaces while also providing services such as legal support and debt counselling. He speculated that such services might be advertised in local newspapers and offered free to all-comers to improve the union's standing in the community. 'We want to provide a one-stop shop of services to actual and potential members at our offices,' he said. The union, which today loses its 70-year-old title of Britain's biggest union to the Unison public-sector union conglomerate, has recovered financially since Mr Morris took over two years ago. Last year the union had a small surplus after a loss of Pounds 12m in 1991. It is now planning to improve efficiency by spending about Pounds 1.2m on updating its information technology systems and 'Pounds 5m to Pounds 6m' on training staff over the next few years. The union is still losing members but Mr Morris described de-recognition as only a 'growing irritant' apart from sectors such as oil where it has become a large problem. Mr Morris has made some headway in reducing the faction fighting within the union although he is still constrained by the power of a hard-left group on the executive. In spite of his attempt to emphasise the union's industrial role, Labour party politics will hang over the conference. The union is expected firmly to reject Mr John Smith's plans for reforming the links between unions and the party although Mr Morris has been noticeably more conciliatory towards the Labour leader than Mr John Edmonds, his opposite number at the GMB general union. The union is also expected to approve support for a change in the electoral system and for entering formal merger talks with the GMB. The full merger is expected to be complete within two to four years. The TGWU is also expected to enter negotiations with the Ucatt building workers' union over a merger.</p>

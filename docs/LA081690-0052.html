			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE PANEL SAYS MALATHION NO SERIOUS HEALTH THREAT;  </P> <P> SPRAYING: A FEW OF THE 26 EXPERTS WON'T ENTIRELY RULE OUT A SLIM RISK OF CANCER  FROM THE INSECTICIDE.  </P> <P> A state panel of scientists and physicians has concluded that malathion  spraying poses no serious health threat after reviewing existing scientific  studies, although a few of the 26 panelists are quibbling about whether they  can entirely rule out a slim cancer threat.  </P> <P> The study group was created by the Deukmejian Administration with the hope of  allaying public fears about the now-suspended aerial spraying over Los Angeles,  Orange, San Bernardino and Riverside counties to eradicate the Mediterranean  fruit fly.  </P> <P> County and state officials said Wednesday that they expect the report, which  will not be completed until next month but was made available this week in  draft form, to satisfy most of the public but not all critics.  </P> <P> "The exhaustive review confirms what we had all along believed to be true,"  said Dr. James W. Stratton, a state Department of Health Services  epidemiologist coordinating the panel's work. "The small amount of malathion  used in the Medfly program is not a public health risk."  </P> <P> The aerial program used 2.8 ounces of the pesticide per acre each spraying,  although most of the 536 square miles that were sprayed received repeated  applications.  </P> <P> But Los Angeles City Councilman Joel Wachs, who has emerged as a leading critic  of malathion spraying, dismissed the report as "nothing more than a study to  validate an existing position."  </P> <P> "They just rehashed old stuff rather than do any of the new studies that are  desperately needed," Wachs said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the yearlong spaying program is on hold as Medfly eradication  officials wait to see if the fruit- and vegetable-destroying pests show up in  sufficient numbers in traps to justify ordering malathion-spraying helicopters  aloft once again.  </P> <P> Since completion of the latest round of spraying late last month, officials  report that only two lone flies have been trapped -- one in Sherman Oaks and  another in Brea.  </P> <P> Critics of the spraying promptly denounced the 400-page report by the Public  Health Effects Advisory Committee as a whitewash and worse.  </P> <P> Critics focused on a possible split within the panel's cancer subcommittee over  whether a cancer risk from malathion can be entirely ruled out.  </P> <P> Dr. Harvey Karp, a Santa Monica pediatrician and one of two dissenters on the  12-member subcommittee, played down the apparent split. He contradicted  predictions from spraying critics that he and Dr. Samuel I. Roth, a retired  Woodland Hills internist, were committed to filing a minority report.  </P> <P> "It's not much of a disagreement, really," he said. "It's just an issue of  semantics. Dr. Roth and I are interpreting the definition of what constitutes a  risk rather strictly."  </P> <P> Karp said he and Roth, who was not available for comment, were awaiting precise  data on how much malathion residents had been exposed to by spraying before  determining if they would file a minority report.  </P> <P> "But I expect that when we get the exposure information, we will conclude that  the cancer risk is negligible," he said. "When all is said and done, we may all  be in total agreement within the subcommittee."  </P> <P> The draft report by the cancer subcommittee, which Stratton said reflects the  majority view, concludes that "studies do not provide evidence for the  carcinogenicity of malathion."  </P> <P> Karp added that "all subcommittee members, including me, feel there is no  strong evidence of cancer risk. There appears to be only a tiny bit of  evidence, and it is weak evidence."  </P> <P> Patty Prickett of Residents Against the Spraying of Pesticides said her group  "expected a whitewash, and that's what it appears we are getting."  </P> <P> She noted that panelists, in their public discussions over the past six months,  often cited a lack of evidence of public risk from malathion spraying.  </P> <P> "It seems to me if the case for the safety of spraying is not proved, then you  don't put millions of people at risk by spraying them 10 times or more,"  Prickett said.  </P> <P> "I don't think this group ever had any serious intent to look into the health  risks," she added.  </P> <P> Wachs, referring to what he termed a "major split" on the cancer subcommittee,  predicted the report "would have little credibility in the community."  </P> <P> He repeated charges aired at hearings he conducted recently at City Hall that  "less than 15% of the people who got sick from the spraying in Los Angeles ever  reported it to authorities, and there was little or no follow-up on those who  did.  </P> <P> "There have been so many gaps in the investigation into public health problems  from the spraying that no one can draw any conclusions," Wachs said.  </P> <P> The panel, named in January by State Health Director Dr. Kenneth W. Kizer, is  composed of scientists, physicians, public health specialists, toxicologists  and statisticians.  </P> <P> Dr. Stuart Siegel, co-chair and head of the department of hematology-oncology  at Childrens Hospital in Los Angeles, called the panel's work the "most  comprehensive review of existing data that has ever been done, even by the  federal government."  </P> <P> Panelists, he said, have spent "countless hours reading and discussing  virtually every significant study ever done on the subject." Panel meetings  were open to the public and were followed closely by critics of the spraying  program.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County Agricultural Commissioner E. Leon Spaugy said Wednesday that  he was "guardedly optimistic" that the yearlong Medfly infestation has been  defeated with aerial malathion spraying and the release of sterile Medflies,  which mate with fertile flies and produce no offspring.  </P> <P> But Spaugy said agricultural officials would not be confident of victory until  they get through August and September -- months that in prior outbreaks have  proved to be times of high activity among the pests -- with traps largely free  of Medflies.  </P> <P> "We're keeping the corks in the champagne bottles until the end of September,"  he said.  </P></p>

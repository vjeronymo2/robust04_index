			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Yemeni People's Will Is the Basis] </F>   [Text] Since it was decided that the Security Council was  to be convened to discuss the crisis in sisterly Yemen, even  though this crisis is an internal issue which the legitimate  authority did not ask to have discussed, all countries taking  part in the meetings of this international body should respect  the Yemeni people's unity, territorial integrity, and legitimacy  in Yemen. Otherwise, foreign interference in Yemeni  affairs--against the will of its people and government--will  complicate the crisis and make it impossible to be resolved.    Sanaa has accepted a cease-fire on the condition that the  declaration of secession by Aden be abrogated and the unity of  the Yemeni people be preserved. This is an objective,  courageous, and responsible position on the part of Sanaa, and  one that all Arab countries and international organizations,  including the Security Council, should support.    If the interference by some Arab and foreign countries seeks  to internationalize the Yemeni crisis in order to encourage and  entrench the secession of the south, this is something that  conflicts completely with Arab League and UN Charters, and at  the same time conflicts and ignores the will of the Yemeni  people.    Halting this destructive war and resorting to fraternal and  constructive dialogue between the north and the south, rather  than the exchange of destructive missiles and shells, is a  national, pan-Arab, and humanitarian demand that both sides  should accept on the basis of emphasizing legitimacy and  national unity, not entrenching secession.    The Security Council is currently facing a difficult test,  and we hope that it will adopt just resolutions which respect  the legitimacy and unity of the Yemeni people and their  territorial integrity, and not encourage the separatist tendency  of a handful of secessionists who deviate from the brotherly  Yemeni people's will in the north and the south.    We would like to remind the Security Council that UN  involvement in resolutions of the crises in Somalia, former  Yugoslavia, and other past and current crises did not solve  these crises but aggravated them in a more dangerous manner than  they had been the case before internationalization.    We also want remind Arab brothers in all Arab countries that  unity was the choice of the Yemeni people and the consensus of  the leaders and masses in the north and south, and this official  and popular choice should not be snubbed.</p>

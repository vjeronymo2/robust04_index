			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Markets Report: D-Mark moves lower What foreign exchanges lacked in trading activity yesterday, they made up in policy speculation as both the D-Mark and sterling weakened amid heightened expectations of interest rate cuts, writes Philip Gawith. In Germany the catalyst was the heavy political defeat for the ruling CDU party in the Lower Saxony parliamentary election, and bullish inflation comments from Bundesbank president Mr Hans Tietmeyer. In the UK, better than expected producer price figures again focused market attention on the prospect of lower interest rates. The dollar had a quieter day after the tribulations of last week. The release of February producer inflation figures today - and consumer numbers tomorrow - will, however, return it to centre stage. The Bundesbank repo announcement today will also be closely watched for indications of the pace of monetary easing in Germany, and hence Europe. The D-Mark was softer across the board yesterday ahead of the repo announcement. In each of the past two weeks the Bundesbank has trimmed the repo by three basis points. The German currency closed in London at FFr3.398 from FFr3.402 against the French franc; at L988.1 from L990.9 against the Italian lira; and at Pta81.94 against the Spanish peseta from Pta82.23. Although the CDU's poor showing in Sunday's election was not unexpected, it reminded the market that some political risk must attach to a country that faces 19 elections in seven months. Of greater importance were Mr Tietmeyer's comments that he expected German consumer inflation to move below 2 per cent. Mr Avinash Persaud, head of currency research at JP Morgan (Europe), said the Euromark contracts in the futures market 'showed some halting of the interest-rate pessimism of last week'. The June contract rose by four basis points to 94.56, indicating that the market expects rates to fall by 50 basis points over the next three months. The repo rate is currently at 5.94 per cent. Analysts believe that the Bundesbank has scope to cut interest rates more aggressively. Compared with conditions when the discount rate was lowered in mid-February, the D-Mark is now much stronger, key wage settlements have been very modest, and the inflation outlook is better. Of the Bundesbank's intermediate targets, only M3 is out of line. Ironically, the 21.2 per cent growth in January was so bad that analysts argue that credibility could actually be lost if too much attention is paid to it. The Bank of France yesterday left its intervention rate unchanged at 6.10 per cent. Although the D-Mark/French franc exchange rate remains fairly stable, dealers report evidence of greater volumes in this currency pair. Sterling weakened yesterday when the release of better than expected February producer inflation numbers renewed speculation about an interest rate cut. Output prices for manufactured goods rose by 0.1 per cent last month, slower than the 0.3 per cent forecast by economists for February, and also below January's 0.3 per cent increase. The Bank of England's sterling exchange rate index finished at 80.6 after opening at 80.8. The UK currency closed slightly higher in London at DM2.5254, from DM2.5210, against the weaker German currency, but was down compared with the dollar, finishing at Dollars 1.4945 from Dollars 1.5025. Mr Mark Geddes, treasury economist at Midland Global Markets, said the numbers indicated a 'total lack of inflationary pressures', and gave the government more flexibility about a future rate cut. Mr Robert Thomas, bond and currency strategist at Natwest Markets, said he thought the government was more concerned about conditions in the real economy than inflation. He predicted that the government might wait for a general lowering of European rates. Sterling futures responded positively, with the June contract up by two points to 94.84. The March 1995 contract rose by five points to 94.24, indicating that the market is expecting base rates of 5.76 per cent a year hence - 50 basis points above the current 5.25 per cent. In the cash market, sterling three-month money was unchanged on the news at 5 3/16 per cent. In the discount market, the Bank of England provided Pounds 375m of late assistance. Earlier it had provided the market with Pounds 999m of liquidity, compared to a revised shortage of Pounds 1.45bn. The overnight rate reached a high of 7 per cent during the day. The dollar was steadier ahead of today's important February producer inflation release. Ever since the Federal Reserve tightened policy on February 4, financial markets have been nervous about resurgent inflation in the US. The US currency finished more than a pfennig up at DM1.6898 from DM1.6779. Helped by the resolution of the Motorola cellular phone case, it also ended firmer against the yen at Y105.880 from Y105.125. The dollar moved higher in New York trading to close at DM1.6910 and Y106.175.</p>

			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Upset for Tate &amp; Lyle A PROFITS warning from Tate &amp; Lyle, the sugar and sweetener group, produced a sharp reversal in the shares, which finished the session as the worst performing Footsie listed stock. The company blamed tight margins in the US sweetener business as the primary reason for the warning, which prompted an immediate swathe of profits downgrades from food manufactur-ing analysts. Most cut their forecasts by Pounds 20m for the current year to around Pounds 220m. For 1993-94, the market range is Pounds 245m to Pounds 255m, about 8 per cent down from the previous figures. The downgrades were accompanied by most brokers turning cautious on the stock, with the feeling among analysts that the shares will be vulnerable to further falls as they undergo a rerating. There was also some consternation at the volatile run the shares have had in recent sessions - including the biggest ever recorded daily turnover last week with over 10m shares traded. Yesterday, volume was a very hefty 6.6m, with the shares tumbling 25 to 375p.</p>

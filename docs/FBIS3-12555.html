			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih,  Presidential Council chairman and commander in chief of the  Armed Forces, conferred this afternoon with the brother  commanders of the Defense Ministry, the General Staff, the  Interior Ministry, the security forces, the directors of  departments and units, and military [word indistinct].    The brother chairman of Presidential Council spoke to them  and reviewed developments in the national arena following the  signing of the document of accord in the Jordanian capital under  the patronage of His Majesty King Husayn and the hospitality of  the fraternal Jordanian people. This meeting was attended by  all Yemeni political and popular forces.    The brother president told the audience: I am glad to meet  with you before the end of this holy month to acquaint you with  the results of this meeting, which received great Arab and  international attention. Everyone thought that immediately  after the signing of this document in Amman the crisis would be  over and the state establishments would reunite in order to  resume work and begin implementing the provisions of the accord  document. You heard what happened later. Now we are making  efforts to reunite the leadership and the state establishments,  and to end all remaining skepticism, which certain elements have  tried to sow. These elements always survive by plotting and  fabricating strife at the expense of the people and the  homeland. The brother president added: It is regrettable that  these forces and elements have been practicing such activities  since the outbreak of the Yemeni revolution and until now.  These forces and elements are only concerned with their own  interests, even if these interests conflict with the  revolution's objectives and the aspirations of the Yemeni  masses. He referred to the traces of fragmentation left from  the Imam's regime and colonialism.    He said: On the eve of establishing the Republic of Yemen  and the unity of the homeland, we were aware that we would face  difficulties caused by these traces left by the old regime. We  hoped that through wisdom and cooperation we would be able to  overcome these difficulties, benefiting from [words indistinct]  the lessons of history. But to those who do not want to see a  united people and a prosperous homeland tried, from the first  minute of unity, to resume their destructive activities. They  poisoned relations of understanding, created a skeptical  atmosphere, and incited division among the sons of the same  homeland. They fomented conflicts and sectarian and tribal  problems, and incited all backward practices, which the unity  came to bury to overcome all tragedies from which our people  suffered for so long.    The brother president said: We, and all the masses of the  Yemeni people, led by the national military establishment, which  offered the dearest sacrifices in defense of the revolution and  for the sake of realizing unity, will work to protect the gains  that we realized throughout the revolution's march, and we will  not retreat whatever the price might be. We are prepared to  sacrifice for the sake of preserving the revolution's march and  to protect the unity of the homeland. We will not hesitate to  offer concessions and to relinquish power, if need be, in order  to preserve the revolution's march and the homeland's unity. We  presented this idea during the Amman meeting, and we said:  Instead of differing over posts, it is possible to sacrifice  some leaders and relinquish power for the sake of the unity of  14 million Yemenis.    The brother president expressed deep sorrow for what  happened  recently in Mudiyah and some areas in Abyan as a result of  certain movements made by some adventurous military commanders,  against the orders and instructions of the political leadership  and the hierarchy of the military command. These commanders  will shoulder full responsibility for the mistakes they made and  for the bloodshed and killing of innocents that they have caused.    He expressed his sorrow and condolences to the families of  martyrs who fell during these regrettable incidents. He  emphasized that the state will take care of the martyrs'  families and will bring to account everyone responsible for  these incidents.    He said every drop of blood shed in these incidents is a  loss  for the people and the homeland. The brother president  considered all those killed in these incidents martyrs for the  sake of unity, stressing that the state is committed to dealing  with all issues that result from these incidents.    The brother president referred to the tasks of the military  committee assigned with ending the military deterioration. He  instructed the commands of the Defense Ministry and the General  Staff to facilitate all tasks of the committee and overcome all  difficulties for it in order to allow it to carry out its duties  in following up implementation of the military aspect of the  document of accord and ensure the withdrawal of the military  forces to their garrisons as they had been before the beginning  of the crisis on 19 August 1993.    The brother president expressed his hope that every effort  would be exerted to restore confidence and dispel doubts within  the command. He said that confidence could not be achieved  through a decision or decree by the Republic, but through  national practice and behavior, apart from exaggeration or  oneupmanship. He asserted that past practices, behaviors,  statements, and media polemics do not honor any nationalist  cause or maintain the homeland's interests. He said that he  issued instructions to the official media to prevent the  broadcast of any statements that may further the current  deterioration.    The brother president pointed out in his speech that it is  the sons of the military and security establishments that paid  the price for the 1972 and 1979 conflicts. He said they were  the victims of the conflict, and that after each conflict before  the unity, disputing parties sat at the dialogue table after our  people paid a high price for those conflicts. So, why do  parties not sit at the dialogue table to discuss all issues in a  brotherly spirit before shedding drops of pure Yemeni blood and  instead of repeating the tragedies, which our people cannot  stand and which we do not need? He pointed out that the unity  is a source of pride and strength for every Yemeni and its is  also a new birth for Yemen. This unity, he said, has produced a  new mechanism, which we should use, benefiting at the same time,  from others' positive experiences in the areas of security,  economy, administration, and construction.    The brother president also pointed out that the signing of  the document of authorization for the military committee by the  brother president and his deputy has won the satisfaction of the  fighters and the masses of the people and that instructions have  been issued to provide every facility for the joint military  committee to achieve success in its mission. The Presidential  Council chairman also stressed that no party has the right to  control any Yemeni region or exercise trusteeship over the  people in any part of Yemen. [Word indistinct] of the  constitutional and legitimate institutions that are freely  elected by the people to represent them here and abroad.    The brother president said: We have great confidence that  you, O brother fighters and comrades-in-arms, will shoulder your  responsibility and confront those who create conflicts in  society. The conflicts should end, and we will do all we can to  prevent sedition in our society. We will root out those who  spread sedition in order to entrench security and stability and  to maintain our national unity. Within the next few weeks, we  will, God willing, return to our bases safely under the banner  of unity and democracy; we will turn over a new leaf in the  interest of the homeland; we will heal the wounds; and we will  exert efforts to promote confidence through dialogue, meetings,  and sincerity. The military committee will withdraw [words  indistinct] to their previous regions in order to translate the  contents of the accord document and to withdraw units from the  dividing lines to other areas. There are good signs, he said,  that the committee will succeed in its mission, and we in the  command will direct and urge all the military commands to  cooperate with the military committee and facilitate its  mission. Any individual or group that rejects orders will be  fully responsible. We hope that this blessed meeting will be a  step toward a comprehensive solution to the crisis. I wish you  every success. The meeting was attended by Interior Minister  Brigadier General Yahya al-Mutawakkil, Chief of Staff Brigadier  General 'Abdallah al-Tihami, Deputy Chief of Staff for  Operations Affair Colonel 'Ali Muhammad Salah, and several  officials from the Defense Ministry and the Interior Ministry.</p>

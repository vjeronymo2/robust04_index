			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Canadian will lead group bidding for Channel 5 MR MOSES ZNAIMER, the Canadian broadcaster who founded City TV in Toronto, is to lead a bid for a Channel 5 licence in the UK. He is to be chief executive of Five TV, which plans to bid for the licence which is expected to be advertised soon. Channel 5 should be able to reach three quarters of the UK audience by conventional transmitters. The winner of the bidding process have to pay for the transmitters and for the retuning of several million video recorders now using the frequencies that Channel 5 will use. If Five TV wins, Mr Znaimer, a former actor and merchant banker, will live in the UK. Five TV is negotiating with potential backers including Time Warner, the world's largest media company, Thames Television and Columbia of the US. The battle for Channel 5 looks like turning into a battle principally between two powerful rivals with different concepts of broadcasting, although there will be other bidders. Five TV will seek to adapt the Toronto model of news, films and music to the UK market. It will create a series of city stations beginning with London and moving on quickly to Birmingham and Manchester. Each city will have two to three hours a night of local news plus a national schedule which will concentrate on music and films. The other main bidder is Mr Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest, which is likely to concentrate on a national channel featuring glossy entertainment. 'What has to be decided is whether the UK has another generalised, homogenised, bits-of-something channel or something new and innovative,' Mr Znaimer said yesterday. 'I'm not selling tonnage (of audience); I'm selling precision.' He believes the UK regulator - the Independent Television Commission - has a clear choice. He says its members can see Mr Berlusconi's channels in Milan or a different model of television broadcasting on his own network in Toronto. He believes the UK is the best place to test his conviction that his 'new model' of television can travel successfully outside Canada.</p>

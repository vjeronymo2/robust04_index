			<p>BFN     [Text] President Sali Berisha held a meeting with His  Excellency Claus Vollers, German ambassador in Tirana and a  representative of the troika of the European Union [EU] in  Albania.    I have invited you to this meeting, President Berisha  addressed Vollers, as a representative of the EU troika. We  will send the same report to the Foreign Ministry of Belgium  with the request that you inform the governments of the EU  member countries as follows:    Albania has the necessary documentation to prove that the  Greek terrorist unit came from Greece and that after the crime  -- the massacre in the recruits' barracks in Peshkepi e Siperme  in the early hours of 10 April, which resulted in the killing of  33-year-old Captain Fatmir Shehu, born in Tepelene, and  20-year-old soldier Arsen Gjini, born in Seman, as well as the  wounding of several other soldiers, three of whom are in serious  condition -- turned back toward Greece in the direction of the  Argjirohor border post.    The Greek military uniforms that the criminals were wearing,  the professionalism of the crime, and the objects that were  found, which are all part of the special units' equipment, speak  in favor of the argument that the Greek unit belongs to Greece's  special units and is subject to special treatment.    In its note dated 10 April addressed to the Greek Government  -- in which the Greek Government is held responsible, since the  terrorist unit came from Greece -- the Albanian Government asked  the Greek Government to find and convict the culprits, as it may  not be directly responsible for the event.    However, from the press statements of the Greek Government,  we have not only heard about its regret over the event, but we  have learned that this responsibility of the Greek Government  was interpreted as a contradiction of the Albanian note by the  Athens government.    As in the cases of the Greek warship firing on an Albanian  motorboat in our territorial waters in Sarande Bay on 4 January  1994, the violation by the Greek minesweeper of our waters near  the Qefal Cape on 10 March, the entrance on 12 March of two  armed Greek soldiers in Vidohov, who threatened the Albanian  citizens, or the murder of 20-year-old Alfred Muco by a Greek  patrol on 21 March, Greece has followed the path of denying the  facts and washing its hands of it by giving no official response.    As revenge against the departure of the person appointed by  Athens as a consul general in Gjirokaster, who was not only  exerting indecent behavior that was incompatible with that of a  diplomat but was also carrying out the duties of a consul  without having the documentation [ekzakuature] accorded by the  receiving country, which is in flagrant violation of Article 12  of the Vienna Convention, Greece did not expel our consul in  Athens but rather the first secretary of our embassy in Athens.    Under these conditions, Albania does not intend to seek  revenge by expelling Greek diplomats from Tirana. However,  based on Article 11 of the Vienna Convention on diplomatic  relations, which states that due to the lack of a clear  agreement on the mission's staff, the receiving state can  request that this staff be kept at a limit it considers  reasonable by considering the circumstances and conditions that  exist in this state and the needs of the mission in question,  Albania therefore asks the Greek Government to take all measures  so that within 10 days, it will have the same number of  diplomats in Albania as Albania has in Athens -- that is, six  diplomats. This number could also be defined on the basis of a  bilateral agreement.    Albania requests the EU Council of Ministers to ask Greece  to  provide an official response to this event. Albania is for  dialogue, but it will not accept the meetings offered without  having an official response by the Greek Government on this  Greek terrorist act. Albania asks the EU Council of Ministers  to set up a commission to verify all the aforementioned  terrorist acts and expresses its readiness for full cooperation  with this commission.    We add that we have no objection to trust this duty to the  existing commission of the EU monitors who are supervising our  northeast border, but as the commission chairman for this  six-month period is a Greek official, according to a known  principle of the right, he cannot represent a party in the  judgment.    We also ask the EU Council of Ministers to demand from  Greece  to put an end to these acts condemned by the UN Charter and  which fully violate the Maastricht principles, which Greece has  committed to keep and develop. We want to assure it that  Albania is determined to cooperate with the European Union and  the member countries, the regional countries, and Greece, as  well as all the other countries who are interested in decreasing  tension and contributing to peace and stability in the region.</p>

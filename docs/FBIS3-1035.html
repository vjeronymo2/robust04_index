The  Nigerian foreign minister was in Cairo yesterday. The Egyptian  news agency MENA announced that a summit meeting between the  Cameroon and Nigerian heads of state will be held in the  Egyptian capital before the end of this month. This information  provoked the amazement if not the anger of the Cameroon  authorities. Listen to what the Cameroon information minister,  Augustin Kontchou, said yesterday evening to Dominique de  Courcelles:    [Begin recording] [Kontchou] Cameroon agrees and has already  agreed to meet the Nigerian president in a neutral country, a  meeting that will obviously have to be planned by the two  countries. Cameroon initially thought of Togo, whose president,  His Excellency Eyadema, visited Cameroon and Nigeria, and whose  foreign minister also visited Cameroon and Nigeria. The door  was not shut. Before announcing a meeting in such-and-such  country, the two heads of state should first agree.    [Courcelles] Do you know if Husni Mubarak has agreed to  mediate?    [Kontchou] We have been approached neither by President  Mubarak nor by any other Egyptian official, nor by any Nigerian  official. Neither President Abacha nor any Nigerian minister  approached us. We don't know the origin of this announcement of  a meeting between His Excellency President Paul Biya and his  excellency the Nigerian president. [end recording]</p>

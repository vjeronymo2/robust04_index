			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / India blames foreigners for scandal THE CHAIRMAN of an Indian parliamentary committee, probing the Rs35bn (Pounds 800m) Bombay securities market scandal, yesterday accused foreign banks of starting the affair, warning they risk retaliation. 'We should seriously think whether they (foreign banks) should be allowed to operate in the country and, if so, at what point and under what circumstances,' said Mr Ram Niwas Mirdha, a former minister who has spent three months investigating the affair. He is the first high Indian public figure to condemn foreign banks over the scandal, which has lead to about 20 arrests, caused heavy losses at leading financial institutions and brought the resignation of a cabinet minister. Mr Mirdha's views indicate that his committee's report this year will strongly criticise foreign banks. That in turn could prompt demands for sanctions against the banks. While the administration of Mr Narasimha Rao is committed to opening up the Indian economy to foreign companies, a deep-rooted suspicion of multinationals, including banks, pervades India. Mr Mirdha said foreign banks had 'become the initiators of massive violations of rules and regulations.' Foreign banks had doubts about some of their activities. But instead of asking regulators for advice they went to legal advisers 'to cover up their tracks', said Mr Mirdha. He added that 'lax all over' supervision by the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, contributed to the scandal. The affair suggested the government should first install a 'proper regulatory framework' before trying to expand and liberalise the financial markets. 'The policy of greater market-orientation of the Indian economy cannot work if the market and market-related institutions are not strengthened,' Mr Mirdha said. His committee has heard that four foreign banks - Citibank and Bank of America of the US, as well as Britain's Standard Chartered Bank and ANZ Grindlays of Australia - dominated inter-bank securities trading. They accounted for two-thirds of trade in the 14 months before the scandal erupted. They have been accused of abuses including flouting guidelines on forward trading, on handling cheques and on portfolio fund management. The next few weeks could see intense argument over the affair as MPs prepare for the opening of the winter session of Parliament on November 24. None of the banks were available to comment yesterday on Mr Mirdha's remarks.</p>

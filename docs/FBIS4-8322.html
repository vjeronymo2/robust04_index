			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 12 (CTK) -- The Czech Republic will  negotiate new trade accords and agreements on investment  protection with Syria and Pakistan. The two documents are  likely to be negotiated with Syria this year, Czech Deputy  Foreign Minister Alexandr Vondra said today. Vondra was  speaking to reporters after his return home from a trip to the  two countries and Iran.    He said that as far as Syria is concerned, all agreements  with that country will be reviewed, which is important from the  point of view of past commitments and accords concluded with  Syria by former Czechoslovakia. Vondra handed over an  invitation for the Syrian foreign minister to visit the Czech  Republic.    Vondra also said that since Syria was a traditional region  for investment and commercial activities by Czech firms, he had  tried to support the activities of Czech business people in  realizing promising projects.    Vondra believes that the issue of Czech liabilities in Syria  dating from the 1970's and particularly from the 1980's will  best be settled through the maintenance of mutual trade  relations. He said Syria was now in a very good position  regarding payments. Over the past two years, particularly after  the Gulf War, it has been a responsible partner, said Vondra.    Pakistan is following the path of extensive privatization of  the state sector. Vondra believes it is necessary for Czech  business people to obtain information about the changed  situation there so that they will be able to orientate  themselves quickly. That was also one of the reasons why the  Czech Government decided some time ago to turn the former  commercial department in Karachi into a general consulate.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih,  Presidential Council chairman, today performed the noon prayer  with their eminence the 'ulema in the historic al-Janad Mosque  in Ta'izz.    The brother Presidential Council chairman attended part of  their eminence the 'ulema's meeting in al-Janad. He delivered a  speech in which he said: I am pleased to attend this meeting,  which encompasses a group of their eminence the 'ulema, in  response to the invitation you extended to me and to brother  'Ali Salim al-Bid to meet on this great day, which is dear to  our hearts and in which the Muslim world celebrates a glorious  Muslim occasion [Prophet Muhammad's night journey from Mecca to  Jerusalem], in this historic mosque that was built by a virtuous  follower of the prophet, Mu'adh Bin-Jabal. This was the first  mosque to be built in Yemen and on this pure soil.    He added: How I wished that brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid was  here in order to work together to preserve the great achievement  of unity that reunited the Yemeni family after its estrangement  and ended from our people's nightmare of division. We come here  to protect our homeland against threats and challenges, and  spare our people from the seditions hatched by those who do not  wish them good, security, and stability. Our responsibility  toward God and our people dictates that we should rise above  trivial matters, selfish interests, and give priority to the  supreme national interest.    The Presidential Council chairman added: Because of the  crisis, our people have for several months now been putting up  with many problems and difficulties, which inflicted serious  harm on them and caused major cracks in the ranks of the Yemeni  family. They also had an impact on the national economy and  spread fears and concern among all of our people--the old,  women, men, and children.    He added: Unity was achieved on 22 May 1990 through  peaceful, democratic dialogue and respect for opinions and  opposing opinions. We must abide by this principle, and not any  other alternative, in order to spare our country any dangerous  slips. You, the Yemeni 'ulema are meeting here after you have  come from various parts of Yemen in order to fulfill a national  and religious duty to unify ranks and stands, champion national  unity, protect Yemeni unity, and spare our country all risks.    The Presidential Council chairman added: You have a  responsibility to say what is right and to stand against evil  and those who fabricate seditions, ignite them, and benefit from  their continuation; and against those who advocate division,  secession, and breaking the national ranks. This is your  national and religious duty, which you have to fulfill to please  God and your conscience and people.    The brother president said: Unity is a great action and a  religious duty. It deserves that we sacrifice all that is dear  and beloved to us to protect and nurture it. Unity was achieved  to stay and to become further entrenched in the heart and  conscience of every Yemeni. It will not be relinquished no  matter the cost.    The president said that he has agreed to all the points and  demands that the brothers in the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP]  put forth, as well as to the initiatives submitted during the  various gatherings to safeguard unity and to spare the homeland  any perils or challenges that endanger the march of its unity  and its democratic course.    The brother president said: We made concessions for the sake  of Yemen and for the sake of the present and future of Yemeni  generations, which depends on the entrenchment of unity that is  protected by democracy. This is why we came here to unite our  stands and resort to dialogue, reason, and logic and to search  for effective means that will safeguard our national unity.  National duty dictates that all of us must safeguard the great  achievement, not to fall prey to our whims and private  interests, and to reach understanding and not fight one another.  We should also deprive those who sow sedition in our society of  any opportunity for the shedding of Yemeni blood. We seek peace  and stability for our homeland and tranquility for our society.    The president referred to the practices that harm the  homeland's unity and its democratic course, which certain  irresponsible writers and newspapers carry out.    The president said: On the personal level, we suffered  greatly from these misdeeds, which violate all laws, norms, and  ethics. We put up with them for the sake of unity and to  entrench the democratic march in our country. However, some  regrettably understand democracy to be slander and harm against  others. They practice democracy in a flawed manner.    The brother president emphasized that democracy represents  responsible behavior and constructive criticism to carry out  reforms and reach better things. The brother president pointed  out the impact the crisis has had on the daily life of our  people and the difficulties and great tribulation it had brought  about. He reaffirmed the need to expeditiously emerge from this  difficult situation in a responsible manner so that all will  devote their efforts to constructive and useful work. He  appealed to their eminence, the 'ulema to guide the sons of the  people to the path of right and good and to what will enhance  national unity and safeguard the homeland's unity, and to always  be advocates of right and soldiers of justice and right, fearing  no one but God.    The meeting was attended by brother Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid  al-Zindani, member of the Presidential council; Field Marshal  'Abdallah al-Sallal; Qadi Muhammad Isma'il' al-Hajji, chief of  the Higher Court and head of the Yemeni 'Ulema Society; and  other officials.</p>

			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / The empire strikes back: John Griffiths on the man and the machines behind McLaren-Honda When he lowers himself into 'Red Five', the nickname of his Canon Williams-Renault formula one car, for the Brazilian Grand Prix tomorrow, Britain's Nigel Mansell will be determined but uneasy. Deep down he knows all too well, even if he cannot readily admit it to himself, that the euphoria of his British supporters at his runaway wins in the first two rounds of this year's world championship could prove short-lived. The road towards his first world championship, for which - at age 38 - he is now desperate, may be barred again by the familiar fluorescent red and white of rival Marlboro McLaren-Hondas driven by arch-rival and world champion Brazilian Ayrton Senna, and his Austrian team-mate Gerhard Berger. The Williams team, and lesser rivals such as Benetton Ford, have good reason for their private unease. The plethora of red-and-white cars emerging from air freighters in Sao Paulo this week make up a technological package with which McLaren hopes to wrest back the advantage it has yielded to Mansell and Williams this season. There was seemingly enough electronic and telemetry (remote data transmission) gear to start a space programme. Developed by TAG International Systems, a McLaren subsidiary, it is used to monitor information produced by more than 800 sensors in each car. Crouched over their display terminals in the race track's pits, McLaren's engineers can observe and analyse everything about the car's behaviour while it is hurtling round the track. In this latest twist of technology, the pits team can alter, by remote control, fuel mixture, the engine speed at which the semi-automatic gearbox changes gear, or dozens of other parameters without the driver so much as lifting his foot off the throttle. The two McLaren drivers have six cars at their disposal, rather than the usual three or four. Three of them, designated MP4/7As, are the new model on which McLaren has staked its credibility, and that of its partner Honda. In secret development for a year, the cars employ 'drive-by-wire' technology which will take Senna and Berger partly into the unknown, in terms of driving techniques, as well as - McLaren hopes - back into the victory lane. There is, for example, no mechanical link between the driver and accelerator, or between the press-button gearbox controls and the gearbox itself. The driver's physical commands are relayed electronically. The engine and gearbox decide between them whether the driver has changed down too early, while travelling too fast. In the recent past, that would have meant an over-revved, and probably exploded, engine. Now, the system can 'ignore' the gearchange for a few microseconds while engine speed is adjusted to suit. It is on this state-of-the art technology that the McLaren-Honda team is pinning its hopes. Having dominated motor racing for most of the past decade, the Anglo-Japanese team lost its edge to Williams - a situation which Ron Dennis, founder, part owner and managing director of McLaren International, does not relish. For Honda, which has spent much of the past decade cultivating an image as 'Japan's BMW' and thus has a strongly commercial stake in McLaren's success, the current scenario is no less galling. Unreasonable as it is to expect any team to carry on winning the world championship ad infinitum, Honda's relegation comes at a time when Grand Prix motor racing, worldwide, has gained unprecedented popularity. The Pounds 1bn a year industry attracts at least 100m television viewers worldwide for each Grand Prix event. Dennis, 45, who now controls a small high-tech empire employing nearly 400 in an industrial estate in Woking, Surrey, has already become a legend in motor racing for the clinical precision with which he has approached winning. His perfectionism extends even to insisting that the 30-strong pit team has all new clothing for every Grand Prix. Combined with his intuitive engineering and managerial skills - he went straight from school in Woking into engineering - it has earned him the grudging respect of McLaren's rivals. It is all the more surprising, therefore, that McLaren should, for the moment, be on the defensive. Dennis admits that McLaren was lulled into a false sense of security by Senna winning the opening four rounds of the championship last year. He concluded that McLaren's cars were sufficiently superior to its rivals for the company to get on with developing the far more advanced MP4/7A for 1992. But by mid-season the Williams team had overcome its initial unreliability and was outpacing the McLarens. Recalls Dennis ruefully: 'Grand Prix is like a roundabout. The music starts, everyone gets on, it increases speed through the season and only slows down when the season ends. And it's very difficult to do anything when you're on the horse. The tools keep sliding off. All the team can do is hold on tight; sometimes the less well-organised teams don't even know if they're sitting on the horse backwards. 'The moment you lose your balance, you're history.' Dennis has no intention of becoming history. Indeed, the group he founded is in the process of metamorphosing into a multi-faceted business in which Grand Prix racing will play only a part, though a key one. Within the next few months, McLaren Cars will launch its first road-going car, an exclusive Pounds  1/2 m machine appropriately named F1 and incorporating much of the technology of the Grand Prix cars. Much of that technology will have been developed by TAG Electronic Systems, which is turning over more than Pounds 15m annually and employs about 100 people. There is also a marketing services company and McLaren International itself, the Grand Prix enterprise. The usually reticent Dennis observes: 'The group is at a crossroads. It is emerging as a corporate entity.' As the drivers climb into their McLarens tomorrow, putting their skills and technology to the test, it will not be the balance sheet that matters, but taking the chequered flag.</p>

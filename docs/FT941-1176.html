			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Loophole in data protection to be shut The Home Office is to close a legal loophole that could allow people to gain unauthorised access to personal data held on computers. Mr Eric Howe, the data protection registrar, welcomed the move, announced in Parliament on Thursday. It follows his call last year for a tightening of the law to cover third parties who obtain electronic personal data by deceit from organisations such as banks and health authorities. The British Bankers' Association said it was delighted by the Home Office's plans and echoed the registrar's concern that individuals and agents specialising in supplying private information have been using deception to get at information such as bank balances and account numbers, pension arrangements and salary details. Although the Data Protection Act, the Theft Act and the Computer Misuse Act are designed to guard such information, it is still difficult for courts to prosecute individuals and agencies who gain unauthorised access by deception. The amendment would make such procurement a criminal offence. Earl Ferrers made the announcement in response to a question by Baroness Nicol, who expressed concerns that 'several members of this House received an offer of services from ACT Investigations Group offering . . . to supply for payment details of personal telephone calls, of mortgage repayments, of bank balances and of arrears on electricity and other bills'. ACT said it 'does not obtain information by deception, but we could not be responsible for all the third parties we deal with'.</p>

			<p><P> August 15, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Health and Human Services Secretary Louis W. Sullivan said he fears Americans  are growing hardened to the AIDS epidemic and warned that more must be done to  alleviate the crisis. In a speech in Washington to a national conference on  AIDS in racial and ethnic groups, Sullivan said: "Our first order of business  must be to make each and every American take notice of this problem. Denial is  an avenue to the spread of the disease." He noted that AIDS has been diagnosed  in more than 100,000 people since the disease was first reported in 1981 -- and  that number is expected to more than triple during the next three years.  </P></p>

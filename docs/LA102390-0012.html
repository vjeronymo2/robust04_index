			<p><P> October 23, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PIECEMEAL FIXES OR REVAMP THE SYSTEM? HOW I'D MAKE SCHOOLS WORK;  </P> <P> BEGIN WITH STATEWIDE EARLY CHILDHOOD PROGRAMS AND SMALLER CLASS SIZES. FUNDING  IS A NO. 1 PRIORITY.  </P> <P> The president of the California Trucking Assn. recently told me that the  industry finds many high school graduates unable to fill out an employment  application properly. Today, one out of three high school students in  California drops out by the 10th grade. Our classrooms are among the most  overcrowded in the country. And despite the fact that achievement-test scores  have been improving, our students still perform below the national average.  </P> <P> So what can we do? Let me summarize some of our proposals:  </P> <P> * Early childhood education -- As I've traveled across California, I've asked  education experts if there is one program that could reduce the high school  dropout rate. To a person, they have responded, "early childhood education."  Teachers often say that they can tell very early when a child is not going to  make it. Quality education for 4-year-olds in classes small enough to allow the  teacher to establish the routine and discipline of learning, as well as to give  the youngster a "jump-start" on fundamentals, can make a dramatic difference  later on. Studies show that a youngster is 40% more likely to graduate from  high school and 60% more apt to get a job by age 19 with the benefit of early  childhood education.  </P> <P> I have proposed that early childhood education be offered throughout the state  to every 4-year-old who needs it and wants it.  </P> <P> I propose a twofold method of funding. First, I want to increase education's  share of state lottery funds to 50% from 34%, earmarking the new dollars for  early childhood education. I have also endorsed Proposition 133, the Safe  Streets Act of 1990, which would provide $235 million to expand access to early  childhood education.  </P> <P> * California must set performance standards for students and make sure they  meet them -- Let's end the practice of promoting and graduating youngsters who  are failing. A school that promotes or graduates a youngster with Ds and Fs  effectively condemns that youngster to failure.  </P> <P> * Class-size reduction -- California class sizes are the second-largest in the  nation. We can reduce them in two ways. First, by reducing the two-thirds vote  required to pass local school bonds to a simple majority, which would allow us  to build the schools we need. "One person, one vote" has always been the  watchword of a democracy. Why should one-third-plus-one of the electorate be  able to stop a community from building the schools it needs?  </P> <P> We need to use available schools year-round. Although this often brings an  initial adverse reaction from parents, "multitrack" programs are being used in  many schools with great success. It is one of the less costly ways of reducing  class size.  </P> <P> Also, legislation is pending to set up two-year community college courses to  train teaching assistants who could aid teachers and thereby help reduce the  adverse impact of large classes. I would certainly sign this legislation as  governor.  </P> <P>  Cooperative work-force training programs -- A number of schools and businesses  are experimenting with these programs. Students who participate agree to  maintain a solid attendance record and meet certain goals. They are paid by  participating businesses for part-time jobs during the school year and receive  on-the-job training. Each student is also assigned a mentor from the  participating business who works with the student. Students who do well in the  program are guaranteed a job after graduation, or a scholarship to a college or  technical-training program.  </P> <P> By "adopting" a youngster every year for the past four years and by helping  others through the establishment of a special program for at-risk youngsters in  San Francisco, I have seen the tremendous impact individual attention can have  on a young person's life. I have learned that often one person who cares can be  a lifeline that makes all the difference to a youngster who has little or no  home support.  </P> <P> I would actively encourage businesses in every community in the state to adopt  a school, providing equipment and mentors, and to develop a partnership with  schools on a continuing basis.  </P> <P> If elected, I will also ask the corporate community to contribute to a unique  teachers' corps concept, whereby college graduates and retirees, for a small  salary, might be willing to work in special pilot programs for at-risk young  people. We must provide the attention necessary to deal with an increasingly  multiethnic and multilingual school population. Motivation is a big part of it.  </P> <P> * Providing financial support for education -- Unlike my opponent, I strongly  support Proposition 98, which sets aside 40% of state general funds for public  schools. It is as important to the well-being of the state as Proposition 13  was to the taxpayer.  </P> <P> * Support magnet schools -- Magnet schools that offer specialized courses -- an  emphasis on the arts, on medical studies or on the sciences, for example --  should be encouraged as a way to offer parents and students greater choice.  </P> <P> We all want our children to do better than we have. Education is the key to  opportunity. It opens the door. It is the way up and the way out. It must be  our state's No. 1 funding priority, and it must command the next governor's  constant attention. If I am that governor, I would hope that after four years,  every man, woman and child in this state would truly understand the importance  and the value of an education, and be determined to see that our children have  that opportunity.  </P></p>

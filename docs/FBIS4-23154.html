			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Karin Brynard and Anne-Marie Mischke in Cape Town] </F>   [Text] The ANC's parliamentary caucus this week voiced its  discontent about the organization's leaders. Several members  are believed to have expressed serious dissatisfaction at  Thursday's caucus meeting, saying that decisions were being  taken without them being considered.    ANC MP's have warned their leaders that in future the caucus  has to be taken into account, especially when they negotiate  behind the scenes with the two other parties in the government  of national unity, the National Party [NP] and the Inkatha  Freedom Party [IFP].    One source of dissatisfaction this week is said to have been  the election of Mr. Leon Wessels of the NP as deputy chairman of  the constitutional assembly against the will of the caucus.    And there was also considerable anger on Thursday stemming  from the absence of President Mandela and several other leaders  from the caucus meeting. They received the message clearly: In  future they must attend caucus meetings.  <H5>  Deeper Cause </H5>   The restlessness has a deeper cause. Many ANC MP's are  deeply concerned that there could be a rift between members at  ground level and the public representatives. If the leaders  cannot even stay in touch with the caucus, it is being asked,  how are the representatives going to keep in touch with the  people out there?    The fear is that the ordinary people will soon say the  representatives are living in luxury and forget about them.  Rumblings were heard this week from trade union circles  concerning MP's salaries.    In the parliamentary debate on the president's speech this  week, ANC MP's have also expressed their concern regarding the  situation. Gill Marcus has referred to the need for  communication with the people out there. Mr. Raymond Suttner  has asked the ministers to continue involving "the people" in  running their departments and in taking important decisions.  The people are not prepared to remain as spectators, he said.    It is against this background, it has been said, that Mr.  Cyril Ramaphosa has decided to refuse a cabinet post to  concentrate on consolidating the party. It is also for this  reason that the National Executive Committee of the ANC, under  the leadership of Mr. Ramaphosa as secretary general, will play  an equally important role -- if not a bigger one than the caucus  -- in constructing ANC policy.    It is also due to the concern over possible alienation  between the representatives and the people at ground level that  the ANC has decided to make the MP's and members of the  provincial legislature responsible for every magisterial  district in the country -- almost like in the days of the  electoral constituencies. In this way the representatives are  forced to maintain contact with the people.    In fact, all parties are talking about the electoral system  of the future. According to the current proportional electoral  system, no provision is being made for constituencies. The  advantage is that a party's support is accurately reflected by  its number of representatives. Nobody is of the opinion that  the system should be completely abandoned.    But RAPPORT heard this week from all parties that in the  five  years before the next election, serious consideration will be  given to a combined system in which a part of the MP's will be  elected based on the proportional system and some will be  elected according to the constituency system.    In Germany, for instance, such a system is used. The problem  is, however, that the system is complicated and could confuse  illiterate voters.</p>

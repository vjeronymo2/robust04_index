			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["agr"-signed report: "DIW: Recessionary Pressures Have </F> the Upper Hand"]    [Text] Berlin -- In its latest weekly report, the  Berlin-based German Institute for Economic Research (DIW),  writes that prospects for an improvement in consumer spending  are extremely slight.    The indications are that recessionary pressures still have  the upper hand and that the forecasts of disposable incomes  remaining static in the first half of 1994 were too optimistic.  As the rate at which prices have been growing is only  slackening slowly, it must now be assumed that private  households will see real incomes fall by a good 3 percent.  Thus, anything other than a further tangible drop in real  consumption would be a surprise.    The DIW ascribes these trends to continued negative  developments on the labor market and the continued shedding of  jobs in manufacturing. The provisions of 1994 collective  agreements too -- incomes are expected to rise by about 2  percent -- are not expected to stimulate consumption. In  addition, state austerity measures and increases in public dues  will also have a dampening effect.    The poor consumer spending climate is in keeping with  overall  economic indicators. The consumption barometer has fallen once  again. Private households expect their financial situation to  deteriorate further over the next few months. In addition,  there is less of a readiness to use savings now.    The prospects for eastern Germany are rather better. The DIW  believes that if prices grow at the projected rate of 4 percent,  an improvement in real incomes is probable. This would create a  favorable situation for an increase in consumer demand.    In western Germany, private consumption fell by 1 percent in  the fourth quarter of 1993. The poor economic climate has  resulted in a decline in savings ratios. The current savings  ratio is 2 percent below the highest level of the fall of 1990  and is only within half a percent of the lowest level of the  recession at the beginning of the 1980's.    In view of the significant increase in administrative  prices,  the recession has only had a gradual impact on price growth.  The cost of living rose by an average of 4 percent in 1993.  The loss in real incomes amounted to about 1 percent last year.  Retail trading was particularly affected, with sales falling 4  percent in real terms.    While expenditure on services, repair work, and rents was  unaffected by the economic climate, in the fourth quarter of  1993, there was a 3.5-percent fall in west German demand for  consumer durables, especially automobiles, followed by consumer  electronics.    In eastern Germany, disposable income rose by an average of  7  percent during 1993 and has thus slowed markedly. Thus, the  reduced scope for increasing spending was partially offset by  cutting back on savings. The savings ratio fell by half a  percentage point between the third and fourth quarters of 1993.    Altogether, private consumption in eastern Germany fell by  0.5 percent in real terms. This was primarily due to a drastic  decline in demand for automobiles. As in 1992, the cost of  living rose by 9 percent, and this was mainly due to the sharp  increase in rents at the beginning of 1993.</p>

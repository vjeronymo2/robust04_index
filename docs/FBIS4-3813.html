			<p>BFN     [Text] The case of the state-owned Guiyang Die-Casting  Plant application for bankruptcy, which had been followed all  along by the residents of the city with great interest, was  wound up by the Guiyang City Intermediate People's Court after  four months of intensive hearings, and the plant was formerly  declared bankrupt on 15 April. This is the first state-owned  enterprise under the jurisdiction of the city government, which  has publicly announced its bankruptcy to society.    The plant was heavily in debt due to sustained  mismanagement.  It was informed that the plant had just 2.7 million yuan or so  in assets at its disposal but its debts mounted to over 4  million yuan. It was unable to repay debts which had become due.  By 15 April, 56 creditor units from Guizhou Province and other  parts of the country had applied to the intermediate people's  court for creditor's rights, of which 45 were granted those  rights.    Yesterday, in accordance with the relevant legal procedures,  the court appointed 14 working personnel from 14 units, such as  the Guiyang City Financial and Auditing Bureau, to form an  enterprise bankruptcy liquidation group to clear the plant's  accounts.</p>

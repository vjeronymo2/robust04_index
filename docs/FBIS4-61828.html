			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Aleksey Kondratyev from the "Focus on Asia" </F> program]    [Text] The current situation on the Korean peninsula can  be compared to continuous cloudy weather. It is not the time to  repeat the causes for the aggravating situation on the Korean  peninsula and tension in Northeast Asia. However, we could  derive a series of conclusions from the current situation.    First, the International Atomic Energy Agency's [IAEA]  pressure on the DPRK to accept full-scope inspections [chonmyon  sachal] of its nuclear objects could not bring about any  substantial results. On the contrary, it made the other party  adhere to its position more. The IAEA inspection team keeps  raising its conditions even though the visas for entering the  DPRK are in its hands.    Regarding this, a recent DPRK statement declared that if the  IAEA does not withdraw its demand for full-scope inspections,  the replacement of the fuel rods of the graphite-moderated  reactor in Yongbyon will be carried on without the participation  of the agency's inspection team.    The threat of imposing international economic sanctions on  Pyongyang is not working either.    Second, the DPRK is demanding a resolution of the nuclear  issue on the peninsula through DPRK-U.S. talks. Regarding this,  the United States has raised some conditions for the resumption  of the talks. Consequently, a resolution is not foreseen yet.    Under current circumstances, Moscow has proposed an  international conference regarding the denuclearization of the  Korean peninsula. Some countries are supporting the proposal.  Whether through the DPRK-U.S. talks or an international  conference, in any case, the nuclear issue on the Korean  peninsula must be resolved. The sooner the resolution of the  issue comes, the better.    As for the peninsula, tension around the peninsula may rise  even more leading to an unpredictable result. All must show  utmost effort and self-control not to turn a quarrel into an  armed collision.</p>

			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> NOW WHAT'S THAT NAME AGAIN?  </P> <P> The annual meeting of the national Jim Smith Society came to order today and it  was time to share stories about what it means to be a Jim Smith. Often, it  means inconvenience.  </P> <P> About 50 Jim Smiths had registered for the gathering, which will include the  Jim Smith golf tournament, the all-Jim Smith softball game, "Meet Jim Smith"  mixers and JIMGO, a version of bingo.  </P> <P> "I've met about 300 Jim Smiths at these conventions over the years and I can  honestly say I never met a Jim Smith I didn't like," said Jim Smith of Camp  Hill, Pa.  </P> <P> The society was founded in 1969 and has 1,533 members worldwide. The Jim Smiths  at the annual meeting can commiserate about the headaches they share because of  their name.  </P> <P> "When I bought my house, I had to sign affidavits saying that I was not the Jim  Smith that was sentenced to 15 to 20 years in prison," said founder Jim Smith  of Dayton, Ohio.  </P></p>

IFP sources told SAPA on Tuesday the  meeting was "routine" and while it would discuss the latest  constitutional developments and a possible general conference to  decide on its stance towards elections, final decisions would  probably be made only later this month.    IFP central committee member Walter Felgate said the Freedom  Alliance -- which includes the IFP -- met on Monday to draw up a  response to a government and African National Congress [ANC]  document on the current deadlock with the alliance. The response  had been sent to the ANC and government on Tuesday morning and  would be made available to the public as soon as a reply had  been received.    He said the IFP could hold a special conference to decide  its  election stance only "once we have the best we can negotiate in  hand". The party's decision to participate in elections could  not be made by the central committee alone but needed a special  conference to canvass grassroot support.    A special conference planned for this weekend was postponed  in light of the January 24 parliamentary sitting, where  amendments to the interim constitution could be approved.    IFP elections campaign political director Peter Miller said  a  special conference to decide on whether or not to contest  elections would depend on the outcome of ongoing discussions on  the interim constitution. "The special conference is the  ultimate policy decision-making body of the party. If it is  necessary to meet it will. Obviously the need for it to meet  will be influenced by what happens in the coming weeks."    IFP national spokesman Ziba Jiyane said the special  conference might even be held after the January 24 parliamentary  sitting, once "we know what the constitution ultimately  contains".</p>

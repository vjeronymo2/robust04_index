			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Survey of Global Custody (8): National powerhouse - Profile of State Street Boston THE 200-year-old State Street Boston, has undergone one of the biggest changes since the 1980s, with a new chief executive, Marshall Carter, replacing William Edgerly, State Street's long-standing leader. Mr Edgerly is credited with transforming the institution from a struggling New England bank into a national powerhouse. Mr Edgerly was quick to realise the importance of new technology to State Street's future growth. Shortly after he took over in 1975, he implemented a programme to modernise State Street's data services and turned the bank's focus towards global custody and securitisation, through mutual funds and money market funds. Today, it is something of a misnomer to call State Street a bank. Strictly speaking, State Street is a bank holding company and does handle some lending and a small number of traditional bank accounts, but the bulk of its business comes from servicing financial assets. State Street now has Dollars 1,247bn in assets under custody, with cross-border assets under custody standing at around Dollars 123bn, up 25 per cent from a year ago. Mr Carter's appointment came as a surprise and followed the unexpected resignation of Mr Edgerly's heir apparent, Mr Peter Madden, last year. Although most observers had expected Mr Edgerly to choose another successor from within the ranks of State Street, the choice of Mr Carter met with widespread approval. Mr Carter, who was at Chase Manhattan for 15 years before joining State Street, is credited with building Chase into one of the biggest global custody businesses in the US. Investors in State Street Boston have little to complain about. Net income for the third quarter has risen more than 50 per cent to Dollars 41.9m, and the institution's stock is trading at the top of its 52-week range. Most analysts expect State Street to continue to generate significant new account volume. Earlier this year it won the important Dollars 65bn California Public Employees Retirement System (Calpers) account. It won the Calpers business by offering to charge about half as much as its closest competitor in fees. The sharp undercutting has led to accusations that State Street bought the business to get market share, and some critics charge that State Street has started a price war which will hurt the bank as well as its competitors. State Street maintains that it attracts its big customers because of its state-of-the-art technology and its full service capabilities, while its economies of scale allow it to offer reduced fees in a maturing market and still make a profit. While some see the aggressive bid for Calpers as a sign of a change in the industry, others see the hand of Mr Carter at work, and suggest it as an indication that State Street will become even tougher. The global custody industry is becoming fiercely competitive after a decade of extremely rapid growth. The industry's staggering growth in the 1980s was fuelled by public and corporate pension funds moving into foreign investments. But as the industry has matured, the pace of growth has started to slow. In addition, several newcomers have entered the arena, including Morgan Stanley, while the merger of Chemical Bank with Manufacturer's Hanover will create competitive global custody operations. One way that State Street is responding to the heightened competition is by turning its attention to emerging markets. 'Emerging markets have always been part of our global custody business,' says Mr Gundy, 'but the range and pace has grown dramatically. We now have a presence in about 46 countries, compared with about 34 countries a few years ago.' Although the rate of growth in emerging markets will probably slow in coming years, Mr Gundy expects absolute growth to continue. 'Institutional investors are looking for exciting opportunities for getting into markets at the earliest possible points so they have a shot at the biggest possible gains.' Mr Gundy believes State Street will also benefit from the Robert Maxwell affair, which has led to a heightened sensitivity to the issue of separating fiduciary responsibility from money management. 'It has changed the inclination of institutional investors, who now want a clear definition of responsibility, separating holding assets from managing assets. I think this will translate into more business for us.' Investing in new technology remains imperative in the global custody industry. In 1991, State Street installed an accounting system to track global securities portfolios in multiple currencies. But State Street's rivals are also spending heavily on new hardware and software. Citicorp, for example, is pumping Dollars 80m into its securities processing systems for a complete overhaul by 1994. Mr Gundy expects to see further fine-tuning of State Street's systems to present more information more clearly and more quickly. So far, the changes within State Street since Mr Carter took charge have been subtle, according to Mr Gundy. 'There has been a re-affirmation of our strategy and an increased focus on the business of servicing financial assets. One piece of tangible evidence is the addition of an executive vice-president responsible for all securities operations. That position didn't exist before Mr Carter came.'</p>

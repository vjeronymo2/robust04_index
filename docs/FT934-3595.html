			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Observer: Citizen watch A case of the biter bit? William Waldegrave, the UK public services minister, missed the start of his own conference in London on Service for the Citizen yesterday. So he didn't hear the prime minister's proud boast that his Citizen's Charter now forces electricity companies to pay their customers compensation if they turn up late to read the meter. However, Waldegrave will not be offering compensation to the delegates who paid Pounds 665 for the pleasure of attending. Delays at Brussels airport, rather than Waldegrave's poor time-keeping, seemed to be the problem.</p>

			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE REJECTS PLEA-BARGAIN OFFER IN PAYOLA CASE, CITES POSSIBLE COERCION  </P> <P> A federal judge refused Wednesday to accept a proposed plea agreement with  independent record promoter Ralph Tashjian and his wife, finding that Valerie  Tashjian may have been "coerced" into pleading guilty to save her husband from  additional criminal charges.  </P> <P> "I can make no finding the plea is warranted or that it is not coerced," U.S.  District Judge Pamela Ann Rymer said of the package agreement, under which the  couple had been scheduled to enter guilty pleas last month.  </P> <P> Tashjian, 41, had intended to plead guilty to a misdemeanor count of making  undisclosed payments to a radio station to add his clients' records to their  play lists and to two felony counts of filing false tax returns and obstruction  of justice.  </P> <P> Under the agreement, Valerie Tashjian, who acted as a bookkeeper for her  husband's promotion business, would have pleaded guilty to a charge of aiding  in the preparation of a false tax return.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Widening Probe  </P> <P> Her plea was halted abruptly last month when she tearfully admitted that she  was actually pleading guilty because she had been told that her husband might  face additional charges in a widening nationwide payola investigation if she  did not.  </P> <P> Lawyers for the Tashjians and the Justice Department's Organized Crime Strike  Force differed on whether it was implicit throughout the plea negotiations that  the government would not accept Tashjian's guilty plea without that of his  wife.  </P> <P> Strike force chief John Newcomer said the government made no intentional  misrepresentations when it failed to mention the reciprocal nature of the  agreements in the package presented to the court.  </P> <P> But Tashjian's lawyer, Anthony P. Brooklier, said in court papers that  government prosecutors specifically declined to include the language in the  plea agreement.  </P> <P> In their own papers, government prosecutors said they made it clear from the  beginning that it would be impossible to allow Ralph Tashjian to plead guilty  while his wife proceeded to trial. Tashjian could then testify in an attempt to  free his wife of blame, without himself facing additional criminal charges,  they said.  </P> <P> Rymer scheduled Valerie Tashjian for trial on May 23 but did not schedule a  trial date for her husband.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 92 (582) by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] The repatriation of all refugees by the end of this  year is likely to double the country's rate of unemployment,  Labor and Employment Minister Shukurjon Zuhurov told INTERFAX.    However, Zuhurov who leads a government delegation in peace  talks with Tajik opposition entrenched in Afghanistan said the  gloomy prospect would be able to force Dushanbe to go back on  its main goal of getting all refugees return safely to their  homes in Tajikistan.    The minister put last year's number of jobless at less than  one million, but the figure may sour up to 1.5 million after the  refugees come back from next door Afghanistan.    Asked whether it was worth bothering about repatriation at  all then, Zukhurov said the government's main priority was to  get the refugees back home while the problem of unemployment,  also besetting other countries, would be resolved in the order  of the day.    The minister said that the cabinet-proposed plan provides  for  only 100,000 new jobs if "the industry functions normally and  proper investment is made," conditions that are likely to emerge  only in five years from now.    One solution to the problem is to sign agreements with CIS  states having their own Tajik communities on exports of extra  workforce there, he said.    As an example, Zukhurov pointed to Turkmenistan hosting an  estimated 50,000 Tajik refugees at the moment, but the local  laws do not provide for their right to employment or housing or  social security benefits.    Overall, the minister is optimistic about the prospects of  normalization in Tajikistan.    And so is new commander of Russian troops in the region  General-Colonel Valeriy Patrikeyev who spoke of things going  back to normal in that country.    Speaking on Saturday, he said that Tajikistan was recovering  from the shock of civil war following government measures and  efforts taken by peacekeeping troops. At the same time, he  spoke of high crime rates in the Republic and high tension on  its border with Afghanistan.</p>

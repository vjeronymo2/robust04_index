			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "A Program To Strengthen the Railroad Transport </F> Economy: At the RF MPS Collegium"]    [Text] An expanded session of the Russian Federation  Ministry of Railways [RF MPS] Collegium was held on 22-23  December, at which there was a discussion of the problems, of  strategic importance for the sector, of further development of  reforms and of strengthening the railroad transport economy in  1994-1995. Taking part in the work of the Collegium were O.N.  Soskovets, first deputy Chairman of the Council of  Ministers-Russian Federation Government, V.B. Yefimov, Russian  Federation minister of Transport, S.K. Shoygu, chairman of the  Russian Federation State Committee on Civil Defense Affairs,  Emergency Situations and Clearing Up the Consequences of Natural  Calamities, B.N. Burachenko, chief of the Department of  Transport, Communication and Social Infrastructure of the RF  Council, corporation presidents V.A. Brezhnev of Transstroy and  V.M. Nalivayko of Transmash, a number of other representatives  of the government, joint-stock and commercial structures  involved in railroad transport work, and also members of the RF  MPS Collegium, chiefs of RF MPS roads, administrations and  departments, authorized representatives of the RF MPS in the  Czech Republic and Slovakia, Poland and Finland, directors of a  number of the sector's railroad divisions, enterprises,  associations, scientific-research institutes and higher learning  institutions, and representatives of the road committees of the  trade union for all the railroads. I.A. Shinkevich, L.B. Titova,  V.S. Myshenkov and Yu.A. Sokhin, from the Central Committee of  the Independent Trade Union of Railroad Workers and Transport  Construction Workers, were in attendance.    G.M. Fadeyev, RF minister of Railways, chaired the Collegium  meeting and gave a report.    O.N. Soskovets, first deputy Chairman of the Council of  Ministers-Russian Federation Government spoke at the meeting.    It was noted in the main report and the reports of the  speakers that putting into practice the Program To Ensure the  Stable Work and Economic Stability of Railroad Transport in  1993, drawn up at the expanded MPS Collegium in December 1992,  mobilizing intra-sectorial reserves and state support made it  possible for the sector in general to achieve the priority tasks  of providing for the transport needs of the country's people and  economy. Unified technological and administrative relations with  the railroads of the CIS and Baltic countries were retained.    In 1993, passenger turnover was 273 billion passenger-km,  i.e., 7.8 percent higher than the level of the past year, and  1,346 million tonnes of freight were shipped (30.7 million  tonnes over the plan). The level of fulfilling the train traffic  schedule and the static load per railcar rose, other indicators  of rolling stock use were improved, and the operations  contingent of workers was reduced. The program for protection of  the social and economic interests of the railroad workers was  successfully put into effect. The Sectorial Tariff Agreement  between the Russian Federation Government, the Ministry of  Railways and the Independent Trade Union of Railroad Workers and  Transport Construction Workers was on the whole fulfilled. The  profit for the railroad transport enterprises for 1993 was about  1.3 trillion rubles [R].    At the same time, this year the sector constantly found  itself in a difficult financial position, primarily because of  the insolvency of the consignors, which often interfered with  prompt payment of wages and made it impossible to renovate  rolling stock properly or completely satisfy the demands for  repair of technical devices. By the end of 1993, the consignors  and consignees owed over R1 trillion for the transport performed.    A number of railroads made by no means full use of internal  reserves, often maintained an excessively inflated operations  staff and fleet of tractive rolling stock and railcars for the  transport volume being fulfilled, and did not show the proper  persistence with respect to a policy of fuel-energy resource  conservation. Quite a few miscalculations were made in  vocational training and placement of personnel, and also in  reinforcing technological and executive discipline, which in  some cases led to gross violation of traffic safety rules,  accidents and wrecks. Most of the railroads failed to take  exhaustive measures to recover debts from consignors and  consignees for transport fulfilled, which put the sector in a  very difficult financial position.    The collegium devoted its main attention to discussing the  financial-economic situation in the sector. The report by the RF  MPS minister and virtually all the speeches of those taking part  in the conference touched on these problems to a greater or  lesser extent. As a result, the Program of Action of the MPS,  Railroads and Other Railroad Transport Enterprises To Develop  Reforms and Strengthen the Sector's Financial-Economic Situation  in 1994-1995 was drawn up and approved. It was proposed that all  production collectives expand organizational work to carry it  out, considering the milestones and indicators outlined in it to  be the minimum necessary to strengthen the economy of the  railroads of Russia and other enterprises of the sector.    The Collegium resolved that preparation be made and the  stage-type transition to a contractual form of interrelations  with the customers be completed in the first six months of 1994.  In accordance with an edict of the President of the Russian  Federation, when concluding contracts, fixed payment periods for  transport are to be established, a flexible tariff policy, based  on economic expediency under specific conditions is to be  followed, tariffs are to be differentiated according to the type  of freight, and the appropriate rebates are to be offered.  Naturally, if the payment deadlines are violated, the consignors  will be deprived of rebates and other benefits, applying to the  full the economic responsibility measure established by the  corresponding decree of the Council of Ministers-Russian  Federation Government.    Methodological instructions on the procedure for calculating  the economic expediency of using a flexible tariff policy for  each transport operation under specific conditions (business  plan) are slated to be worked out and sent to the railroads  before 1 February 1994. In the 1st quarter of 1994, additions to  the appropriate articles of the Railroad Charter, pertaining to  the introduction of the contract form of interrelations between  the railroad workers and consignors and consignees, are to be  submitted to the Council of Ministers-Russian Federation  Government for approval.    The competitiveness of railroad transport is to be increased  on the basis of carrying out flexible tariff regulation for  international transport and raising the throughput and  processing capacities of the border stations and the quality of  information and dispatch services. At the same time, freight  should be accepted for international transport service only on  condition of pre-payment of the impending transport services.    The Collegium devoted particular attention to debit  indebtedness. As we know, this is one of the main reasons for  the tension arising in the sector's financial situation. To  reduce it, in January-February 1994, special subdivisions will  be created at the RF MPS, railroads and divisions, which will  deal with offsetting mutual debts between railroad transport  enterprises, as well as those of the enterprises of other  sectors of industry. In this case they will first start clearing  off the debts of the MPS enterprises for fuel-energy resources.  In addition, in the 1st quarter of 1994, other structures are to  be created at the MPS and on the railroads to implement clearing  accounts for the debts of customers, including through obtaining  their products with subsequent sale on domestic and foreign  markets and using promissory notes in clearing accounts with  freight owners.    At the same time, the railroads are permitted to increase  the  established limit of advance financing, if the assignments for  the transit railroads and the MPS to transfer funds are  fulfilled. A procedure will be worked out in the near future for  settlements with the railroads for sums exceeding their advance  financing limit.    In order to ensure the comprehensive development of railroad  transport as a unified production system, the Collegium accepted  the proposals of the railroads, plants and other enterprises and  organizations of the sector to form the following centralized  funds and reserves in the RF Ministry of Railways to finance  general sectorial expenditures:    --a railroad transport investment fund to acquire specific  types of rolling stock and finance a number of construction  projects and facilities of general sectorial importance, needed  to support and develop the sector's material-technical base;    --a fund to support railroad transport educational  institutions, in the amount of 0.3 percent of the revenues;    --a fund to support central public health institutions for  the sector, in the amount of 0.2 percent of the revenues;    --a financial reserve for the RF MPS, in the amount of 1.5  percent of the balance profit;    --a fund to finance NIOKR [scientific-research and  experimental-design work] of a general sectorial nature, in the  amount of 1.5 percent of the revenues.    In the 1st quarter of 1994, the level of the norm for  withholdings for the RF MPS investment fund will be submitted to  the RF Ministry of the Economy and RF Ministry of Finance for  approval. In addition, the Statute on Education and Use of the  Fund for Support of Public Health Institutions of the RF MPS is  to be updated and submitted for approval.    In 1994-1995, a unified all-network automatic accounting and  statistical information transmission system must be set up. This  will require revision of the list and volume of sectorial  statistical reporting, and rescinding of obsolete indicators.    The time has come to form a unified banking system for the  sector. Today, along with powerful, viable financial  institutions, small-scale institutions, capable of serving, for  example, the needs of only one depot, are often set up at  transport enterprises. Determining the main directions for the  development of the banking system, drawing freight owners into  the service of this system, and also attracting the savings of  railroad transport workers and the people are, therefore, very  urgent tasks. The organization of bank branches on railroad  divisions is to be completed in the first half of 1994.    Ensuring a further rise in the level of passenger transport  organization is one of the priority tasks of railroad transport.  Under the conditions of the unprecedented rise in prices for  air, sea, river and motor vehicle travel, the railroads often  become the only affordable means of transport for the  population. Because of this, railroad workers should devote  priority attention to the problems of satisfying the people's  demand for passenger, freight and baggage transport, improving  the standards of service to passengers at terminals and on the  trains and keeping to the schedule of passenger train runs. We  must nevertheless also remember the factor of economy in this  transport. For 1994-1995, therefore, differentiated indexing of  tariffs is specified for long-distance passenger transport,  based on the category of trains and railcars. This indexing is  called upon to ensure that, in 1995, transport shows no loss,  and after that, shows a profit. Similar measures are outlined in  suburban traffic, by agreement with local bodies. In this  connection, it is recommended that the chiefs of railroads and  divisions continually work with local organs of authority and  freight owners to regulate local taxation, establish tariffs for  electric power and allocate funds to finance suburban transport  and acquire rolling stock, build railroad facilities, and  provide for other needs.    It was also proposed that, on a monthly schedule in 1994,  the  need for routine and capital repair of technical devices, based  on the transport work actually performed, be precisely defined.  After this, in accordance with the normative requirements, the  allocation of the necessary resources is to be specified in the  plans, and no demands for maintaining technical devices for  transport may be put off. It is time for the roads to examine  the organization of material-technical support for line  enterprises and to take measures to reinstate supervisory  monitoring of the supply of materials and spare parts.    The Collegium adopted a resolution to improve the plan for  scientific-research and experimental-design work in 1994, drawn  up by the RF MPS and approved by the railroads. Guided by the  Strategy for Scientific-Technical Policy Under the New  Conditions of Railroad Transport Work, adopted at the expanded  session of the Presidium of the NTS [Scientific-Technical  Council] of the RF MPS, it recommended that, when necessary,  creative scientific-production groups of specialists be formed  to draw up priority proposals ensuring the development of  reforms in railroad transport.    In the 1st quarter of 1994, proposals will be prepared  concerning the idea of improving the system of tariffs for  freight and passenger railroad transport under market  conditions, which outlines specification of the form of  addressed state support of railroad transport enterprises and  the sectors served by them, and also the necessary volume of  investments from the republic budget in the development of  railroad transport, which should be taken into consideration in  determining the tariff level.    Because of the reduction in the network's work volume in  certain railroad regions, a disproportion has formed between the  rolling stock fleets required for operational needs and the  surplus fleets. To bring them into line, it has been specified  that the surplus fleet of railcars and locomotives be taken out  of operation, by removing from the inventory, in 1994, 50,000  railcars which have worked out their service life; that the  railcars on the roads and at industrial enterprises of the  sector be divided up; that spare parts, after reconditioning, be  sent to supplement the working technological reserve, and  wheelpairs with rolling axle-boxes be used to replace wheelpairs  with plain-bearing axle boxes. It was decided to transfer,  during 1994, 100,000 railcars to the long-term MPS reserve,  carrying out their appropriate preparation and mothballing, and  determining the storage sites which should be equipped with  lighting, fire-fighting devices and other measures to be  fulfilled for the purpose of ensuring the safeguarding of this  rolling stock. Here it was established that in distributing  among the roads the expenditures for depot and capital repair  and updating the freight cars, their depreciation, and also  payment for exceeding the quota of the railcar fleet indicated  as a reserve, not be taken into account. At the same time,  changes must be introduced into the system of statistical  accounting and reporting for the freight car fleet. Some of the  locomotives will also be transferred to the MPS reserve, with  ensurance of their mothballing and placement at reserve bases or  station and siding tracks specially equipped for this purpose.  Each road should establish a maximum norm for maintaining  locomotives in the reserve of the road administration to cover  the daily fluctuations of transport work, but not over 10  percent.    Guided by the Basic Directions for Work on Fuel and Power  Conservation in Railroad Transport Under the Conditions of  Liberalization of Prices for Energy Carriers, adopted by the  Presidium of the NTS MPS, it was designated that specific  details be given for the work of the fuel-energy commissions for  line enterprises of the divisions and roads, directing their  efforts primarily toward expanding the list of specific norms  per unit of work or output and increasing accounting and  monitoring of the use of energy resources. It was decided to  boost the introduction of resource and energy saving technology,  reconditioning and reinforcing of parts for repeated use,  mechanization of work places, non-dismantling diagnostics, and a  reduction in the wearing out of rails and wheel flanges in 1994  on the Far Eastern, Transbaykal, October and Krasnoyarsk  railroads, in 1995 -- on the Sverdlovsk, Gorkiy and Southeastern  railroads, and in 1996 -- on the rest of the country's mainlines.    Safety is a very important problem in transport. To improve  the state of traffic safety, particularly that of passenger  trains, the following are to be ensured in 1994:    --studying and introducing, beginning in the second half of  1994, new rules for technical operation, instructions for train  traffic and shunting operations and instructions on  signalization on RF railroads;    --carrying out technical inspections and checks of the  railroads, divisions and enterprises, regarding this as one of  the most important elements in preventive work. Introducing a  procedure for compulsory personal examination of the results of  the inspections of enterprises by the chief of a road division,  of road divisions -- by the chief of the railroads, and of  railroads -- by directors of the MPS;    --developing and introducing the newest technical devices  increasing train traffic safety, specified by the assignments of  the State Program for 1994-2000;    --ensuring fulfillment of the requirements for observing  safety measures when transporting hazardous freight and  performing shunting operations with railcars loaded with this  freight;    --organizing the training and instruction of workers  involved  in processing hazardous freight and rolling stock loaded with it.    A competent solution to social problems is one of the most  important conditions for a successful solution to the problems  facing railroad transport. It is because of an efficient policy  in this sphere that the railroad workers have managed to avoid  many social conflicts, which have literally shaken other sectors  of industry. Because of this, the Collegium feels that, to  ensure the social protection of the railroad workers in  1994-1995, its main task should be considered to be fulfilling  the Sectorial Tariff Agreement, following a coordinated policy  in the sphere of wages and ensuring the comparability of wages  by railroads and regions, on the basis of the conditions,  intensiveness, difficulty and quality of labor. The sectors are  to maintain, in 1994-1995, the rates of housing construction  achieved, drawing in the resources of enterprises, cooperatives,  railroad workers and other sources of financing.    Reinforcement of lawfulness and legal procedure and  unswerving adherence to existing legislative and normative acts  in the subdivisions of railroad transport must be ensured in  transport. Business contacts with law-and-order authorities must  be strengthened, and preventive and legal education work put  into practice with their participation. When violations of the  law are revealed, efficient measures should be taken to  eliminate them, making the guilty workers answerable.    In order to increase the discipline of workers involved in  train traffic, and particularly those involved in passenger  service, it is recommended that the directors of enterprises use  the contractual form of concluding labor agreements, and specify  in them, in accordance with labor legislation, the  responsibility for proper execution of service duties.    By decision of the Collegium, the executors responsible for  each point of the Program were determined, and plans were made  to establish periodic monitoring of the course of its  fulfillment at enterprises and in associations -- monthly; on  divisions and railroads -- quarterly, with a report to the MPS  for the road as a whole; in the MPS administrations --  quarterly, with a report to the deputy minister. To monitor the  course of fulfilling the decisions of this Collegium, a work  group, directed by O.A. Moshenko, first deputy minister, was set  up to assist the roads. A procedure was established for  quarterly summing up of the results of fulfilling the  assignments of the Program, with analysis of the success of the  measures being carried out. This work group is entrusted with  the preparation, in the first half of 1994, of proposals for the  improvement of the sector's administrative system.

Clark, Dunmore, Pennsylvania. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> I <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Brian A. Clark was the President and Owner of August Corporation (Licensee), the holder of expired Byproduct Materials License No. 37&hyph;20935&hyph;01 (License) issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC or Commission) pursuant to 10 CFR Part 30 on November 15, 1985. The License authorized the possession and use of an americium-241 sealed source, not to exceed 44 millicuries, in a Troxler Electronics Labs gauge, in accordance with the conditions specified therein. The License expired on November 30, 1990, and the NRC has been informed by Mr. Clark that August Corporation is now defunct. Since the expiration of the License, the byproduct material has remained in the possession of Mr. Clark at his residence at 1608 Adams Avenue, Dunmore, Pennsylvania 18509. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Licensee did not submit an application for renewal of the License under 10 CFR 30.37 prior to its expiration, nor did the Licensee notify the Commission, in writing under 10 CFR 30.36, of a decision not to renew the License. Although Mr. Clark stated his intentions, in a telephone conversation he initiated with Mr. William Oliveira, Health Physicist, NRC, Region I, on December 27, 1991, to obtain a license in his name, as of this date, Mr. Clark has not applied for, nor obtained, an NRC license. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On February 24, 1992, the NRC, Region I, issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) to the August Corporation for failure to request renewal, or to file a notice of non-renewal or transfer of the byproduct material, prior to expiration of the License. The letter forwarding the NOV directed the Licensee to place the gauge in secure storage and not to use the material until the Licensee obtained a new NRC license. Neither the Licensee nor Mr. Clark responded to the Notice of Violation, even though Mr. Clark was again telephonically contacted by Mr. Charles Amato, Health Physics Inspector, NRC, Region I, on December 29, 1992, and informed that he was illegally possessing radioactive material, had not responded to the Notice of Violation, and enforcement action could be taken. Although Mr. Clark again stated that he wanted to obtain a license in his name, he has not applied for an NRC license. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, in a July 1, 1993 letter, the NRC again reminded Mr. Clark of the need to respond to the NRC Notice of Violation. Further, Ms. Sharon Johnson, Administrative Assistant, NRC, Region I, in a telephone conversation that Mr. Clark initiated on February 25, 1994, and telephone conversations that Ms. Johnson initiated on March 15, 1994, and March 28, 1994, reminded Mr. Clark of his possession of NRC-licensed material without a license. Mr. Herbert Kaplan, Senior Reactor Engineer, NRC, Region I, discussed the same issue in a subsequent telephone conversation that he initiated on April 28, 1994. To date, Mr. Clark still possesses the gauge without an NRC license and without applying for such a license. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Mr. Clark remains in possession of NRC-licensed radioactive material without a license. This is prohibited by Section 81 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and by 10 CFR 30.3, which state that, except for persons exempt as provided in 10 CFR Parts 30 and 150, no person shall possess or use byproduct material except as authorized in a specific or general NRC license. Furthermore, based on the above, Mr. Clark has deliberately violated NRC requirements by possessing the gauge without a license. This conclusion is based on the fact that Mr. Clark never filed a renewal application before the License issued to August Corporation expired on November 30, 1990, as required by 10 CFR 30.37; Mr. Clark has not responded to an Inquiry Letter (No. 90&hyph;001) dated November 28, 1990, sent by the NRC before the License expired; Mr. Clark has not responded to the NRC Notice of Violation issued on February 24, 1992; Mr. Clark has not respond to an NRC letter, via ``CERTIFIED MAIL'' dated July 1, 1993, addressing his previous failure to respond to the Notice of Violation; Mr. Clark has refused to dispose of the radioactive material; Mr. Clark possesses the radioactive material contrary to 10 CFR 30.3, without a valid NRC specific license; and Mr. Clark has stated to the NRC on numerous occasions that he wants an NRC license (in his own name), but has not applied for such a license. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Improper handling of the gauge can result in an unnecessary exposure to radiation. The Atomic Energy Act and the Commission's regulations require that material possessed by the Licensee be under a regulated system of licensing and inspection. Mr. Clark's possession of NRC-licensed material without a valid NRC license, as documented in the February 24, 1992 Notice of Violation, and his unwillingness to respond to numerous NRC written and verbal communications to apply for an NRC license, demonstrate a deliberate disregard for NRC requirements. Mr. Clark, by continuing to possess material after being notified of the expiration of the License, has demonstrated that he is not willing to comply with Commission requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Given the circumstances surrounding Mr. Clark's possession of the byproduct material and his lack of communication with the NRC, I lack the requisite reasonable assurance that the health and safety of the public will be protected while Mr. Clark remains in possession of the radioactive material. Consequently, the public health, safety, and interest require the imposition of the requirements set forth in Section IV below. Furthermore, pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202, I have determined that the significance of Mr. Clark's actions described above (specifically, the deliberate possession of licensed material without a License, after repeated NRC notification of the need to either obtain a license or transfer the material to an authorized recipient) is such that the public health, safety, and interest require that this Order be immediately effective. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, pursuant to Sections 81, 161b, 161i, 161o, 182 and 186 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the Commission's regulations at 10 CFR 2.202 and 10 CFR Part 30, It Is Hereby Ordered, Effective Immediately, That: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

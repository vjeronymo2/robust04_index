			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Leading Article: Mr Heseltine at industry SECRETARY OF STATE for trade and industry may not have been the crown Mr Michael Heseltine most fondly dreamed of wearing during his years in the political wilderness, but it is one for which he is singularly well prepared. Following his resignation from the Thatcher government in 1986 over the Westland affair, Mr Heseltine set out in explicit terms his preferred job description. It is an interventionist view which will be welcomed in many British boardrooms, not least for its primary assertion that government must worry hard about the health of manufacturing industry. Much less clear is the extent to which Mr Heseltine will seek or be allowed to implement a personal manifesto which contrasts so sharply with the official version published one month ago. The party manifesto, bearing the mark of his free market predecessor, has almost nothing to say about manufacturing, beyond a commitment to further deregulation and tax cutting. It also proposes that the DTI take over the powers of the energy department. Mr Heseltine's credo is that since all governments, in one way or another, make decisions that have a large effect on business, it is best to shape those policies into an industrial strategy. He has advocated 'a new partnership' between government and industry, in which government thinks more carefully about the industrial impact of all its decisions, including procurement, taxation, overseas representation, science, education and employment law. Without French interventionism, he says, Europe would have no commercial aircraft industry. It is difficult to imagine Mr Heseltine privatising part of the Export Credits Guarantee Department or the British Technology Group - both acts of the last Thatcher/Major government. Employee dialogue He is also in favour of a revived National Economic Development Council, a creation of Harold Macmillan which, he argues, has 'never fulfilled its potential'. He has proposed that the industry secretary rather than the chancellor should chair this tripartite body and that its membership include the financial institutions which own most British industry. More controversially, he has said that any company with more than 500 employees should be required to demonstrate that it has effective mechanisms for dialogue with its workforce. It is thus difficult to see why Mr Heseltine would want to resist the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty, something which Mr Major has made an article of faith. And so on. He favours strong fiscal incentives for business investment, such as the soon to be discontinued Business Expansion Scheme, and worries about too much foreign investment. The future of the Rover group, a 1987 book says, is necessarily 'a matter for the government', not least because of the 'ominous increase in foreign ownership and control' of the UK motor industry. He proposes a 'positive benefits' test for mergers, which has more in common with the Labour party's ideas than the Tebbit-Lilley doctrines which still officially hold sway. Potential conflict At his most ambitious, Mr Heseltine has sounded like a would-be minister of the supply side economy, buttressed by a Cabinet-level industry committee. Even denied this, he faces potentially serious conflict with the Treasury and the competition directorate of the European Commission, run by a fellow Westland victim, Sir Leon Brittan. Clear policy identity can only emerge from this muddle when compromise, brokered by the prime minister, has occurred. Meanwhile, some urgent priorities lie on the non-industry side of Mr Heseltine's brief: the Gatt round, the opening of western European markets to east European goods, the privatisation of the coal industry and the need to introduce stronger market pressures into the energy utilities. As for the 'partnership' agenda, it is by no means to be dismissed out of hand. A revived Nedo capable of trenchant policy analysis and ideas-generation is much to be desired. Corporate governance does need to reflect a wider view of ownership. If Mr Heseltine can balance this with an enhanced regard for competition policy and expunge from his thinking a trace of outdated nationalism, the DTI could yet prove to be his finest hour.</p>

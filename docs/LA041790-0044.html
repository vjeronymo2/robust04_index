			<p><P> April 17, 1990, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> WASHINGTON, D.C.;  </P> <P> EDITOR OF NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC FIRED  </P> <P> Wilbur Garrett was fired as editor of National Geographic magazine after months  of mounting tension with Gilbert M. Grosvenor, president and chairman of the  National Geographic Society.  </P> <P> The move was cast as a resignation when it was announced to ranking editors.  William Graves, assistant editor for expeditions, will replace Garrett. Sources  said Garrett and Grosvenor had been on a collision course over the editor's  efforts to adapt the 102-year-old magazine to a changing, and younger,  readership. Another conflict was Garrett's resistance to cutting staff and  editorial spending during a period fo belt-tightening.  </P></p>

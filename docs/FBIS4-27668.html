			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 3 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean  Government is preparing for the imposition of sanctions on  Pyongyang, judging that punishment of North Korea has become  inevitable since the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  officially announced that later measurement of discharged fuel  rods at a disputed reactor in North Korea has become impossible.    The government, in particular, is seriously considering  gradual suspension of inter-Korean trade, amounting to 180  million U.S. dollars per year.    The issue was discussed at a policy coordination meeting on  national unification and security chaired by Deputy Prime  Minister Yi Hong-ku Friday [3 June] morning at the South-North  dialogue secretariat in Samchong-tong, Seoul.    Yi, who is concurrently minister of the National Unification  Board, said through board spokesman Kim Hyong-ki that "the  international community is already taking the course of imposing  sanctions against North Korea," adding that the government is  studying various sanctions against Pyongyang.    Yi is the first high-ranking government official to comment  officially that sanctions are being studied against North Korea.    "The participants in the meeting shared the recognition that  the North Korean nuclear issue has turned into a more serious  situation," he said. "We are facing a grave challenge in our  efforts to find a peaceful solution to the nuclear problem."    In a related development, the government will hold a meeting  soon with the United States and Japan to discuss sanctions  against the North. The meeting will be attended by Korean  Nuclear Affairs Ambassador Kim Sam-hun, U.S. Assistant Secretary  of State Robert Gallucci and Deputy Director-General Yukio  Takeuchi of the Japanese Foreign Ministry's Asian Affairs Bureau.    The tripartite meeting is expected to touch on the Japanese  Government's prohibition of remittances to North Korea by  pro-Pyongyang Koreans in Japan who belong to a group called  Chochongnyon [General Association of Korean Residents in Japan],  which sends North Korea 60 billion-80 billion yen per year.    In addition, the meeting is likely to discuss military  build-up programs in preparation for any emergency on the Korean  peninsula.    Other government officials here said that "the time to  discuss whether or not to impose sanctions has already passed,"  emphasizing the inevitability of sanctions. "We will, however,  have close consultations with our allies on detailed procedures  and timing," they added.</p>

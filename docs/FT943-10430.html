			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Scotland Yard probe into Gibraltar 'fraud' Britain's Scotland Yard and Danish police are investigating allegations of a Pounds 5.4m fraud linked to a large property development in Gibraltar. Mr John Blackburn Gittings, the colony's attorney-general, resigned on Wednesday night, 11 months before completion of his three-year term in office, citing difference of views between himself and the governor of Gibraltar, Sir John Chapple. It is understood the resignation follows growing differences of opinion between Mr Blackburn Gittings and the British government. For example, Mr Blackburn Gittings was opposed to the continuation of the fraud investigation, it emerged yesterday. Although appointed by London, Mr Blackburn Gittings had also acted as legal adviser to ministers in Gibraltar during a period of growing tension between the local government and London. A criminal lawyer who is unaccustomed to the complexities of colonial politics, Mr Blackburn Gittings is thought to have concluded that conflicts of interest had left him with no alternative but to resign. There has been a long-running police investigation into alleged irregularities arising out of the multi-million property development financed by Baltica Finans, the Danish finance company. It is understood that the attorney-general had come to the view that police should be told by the British government to call off their investigation because of insufficient evidence. This is not a view shared by British and Danish police, who have uncovered a series of unusual money transactions and taken evidence from former Baltica employees alleging payments to Gibraltarian ministers. Britain is meanwhile anxious to be seen within the EU to be adequately supervising the colony's affairs by pursuing any allegations of corruption. The Swiss Justice Ministry said yesterday it had received requests for legal assistance from the Danish government and the attorney-general of Gibraltar relating to the Baltica affair in the spring of 1993. The Swiss authorities agreed to provide documentation on accounts held in banks in the northern Swiss towns of Soluthurn, Grenchen and Bern. Police are investigating whether there are any links between the accounts and a trust in Liechtenstein called the GDP Foundation, which is alleged to have held monies on behalf of the Gibraltar government. Four Danes, including a former employee of Baltica, are standing trial in Denmark after being charged with defrauding a local construction company, JPC, which was involved in the Gibraltar property development. The charges relate to payments totalling Pounds 5.4m. The former employee has testified that a payment of Pounds 250,000 was made to a Gibraltar minister in connection with the property development. A former JPC employees has testified that a further payment of Pounds 400,000 was made to the minister. The Gibraltar government has refused to answer questions relating to the Baltica affair. But the chief minister, Mr Joe Bossano, said: 'There are allegations of fraud perpetrated by Danes against Danes involving Danish money. There is no Gibraltarian money involved.'</p>

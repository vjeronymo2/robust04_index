			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / International Company News: Reduced domestic demand squeezes margins at Toray TORAY Industries, the leading Japanese maker of synthetic fibres, reported a 6.6 per cent fall, to Y48.2bn (Dollars 434.23m), in pre-tax profit for the year to end-March. The result reflects reduced domestic demand, which led to increased price competition and smaller margins in most sectors. Sales for the year were down 3.2 per cent to Y580bn, with a 6.8 per cent decline in fibres and textiles and a 5.5 per cent fall in plastics and chemicals. However, new products and other businesses, including materials used in sporting goods and pharmaceuticals, surged 20.6 per cent. Sluggish demand for consumer electronics in Japan was partly responsible for the fall in plastics and chemicals sales, while intensified competition in the polyester film market reduced the company's overseas margins. Consolidated sales slipped a marginal 0.6 per cent to Y970.5bn, while net profit was down 3.1 per cent, as demand in east Asia for industrial materials remained relatively strong. For the current year, the parent is expecting a slight increase in sales to Y590bn, but pre-tax profit at around the same level as last year's Y48bn. Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals reported a 58 per cent plunge in pre-tax profits to Y6.3bn, which it blamed on weaker sales of synthetic resins and plastics to the car and electronics industries, and increased depreciation charges. Sales were down 6.4 per cent to Y395bn. Mitsui Toatsu plans to halve its dividend to Y3 and forecast another 20 per cent fall in profits to Y5bn this year on sales of about Y390bn. Mitsubishi Petrochemical experienced a steep 72.7 per cent fall in pre-tax profit to Y8.3bn, as prices weakened for core products such as ethylene. While sales volume remained flat, sales value was down 8.5 per cent to Y372.1bn, and is expected to remain at the same level this year. Pre-tax profit is forecast to slip to Y4bn.</p>

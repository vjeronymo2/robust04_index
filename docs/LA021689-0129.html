			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'HEADHUNTER' SURVEY;  </P> <P> IT'S HARD TO DRAW EXECUTIVE TALENT TO THE SOUTHLAND  </P> <P> Southern California may be pricing itself out of the competition for top  corporate talent, according to a survey on executive relocation released  Wednesday.  </P> <P> More than 70% of personnel officers in large Southland companies surveyed by  Russell Reynolds Associates, a headhunting firm, said it has become difficult  to recruit executives to jobs in Southern California.  </P> <P> The biggest reason: skyrocketing housing costs, cited by 90% of the 129  personnel officers questioned. Traffic congestion and smog are the other big  deterrents to putting down stakes in the Southland, the survey says.  </P> <P> "This is creating a real inhibition on getting executives and talent outside  California to move here," said Harry Usher, the former Los Angeles Olympic  Organizing Committee executive who is Russell Reynolds' managing director in  Los Angeles. "It's not just the cost of housing or the cost of relocating, but  it's also the concerns about the quality of life."  </P> <P> The survey of firms with at least 500 employees and $50 million in annual sales  offers further fuel for the economists, politicians and slow-growth activists  who have been warning that Southern California may be choking on its own  success.  </P> <P> Even as the region's population continues to surge, they have worried that a  shortage of affordable housing, jammed highways and polluted air eventually  will make the Southland unattractive to migrants from elsewhere in the United  States and from abroad.  </P> <P> That scenario -- hinted at in the Russell Reynolds survey -- could snuff out  Southern California's economic advances and send the region into a tailspin,  these experts say.  </P> <P> "The question I would ask is whether we're robbing ourselves of a needed skill  base," said David Hensley, director of California forecasting for the UCLA  Business Forecasting Project, which has warned of a coming day of reckoning for  the Southland's booming economy.  </P> <P> "Just given the links between the pricing of homes and growth in the economy,  we would expect there would be some dampening effect," added Adrian R. Sanchez,  associate economist at Security Pacific National Bank in Los Angeles. "But  there's no way of quantifying it or saying when, in fact, the other shoe will  drop."  </P> <P> The personnel officers questioned by Russell Reynolds said Southern  California's economic climate and weather still are viewed as attractive by top  executives weighing job offers here. And nearly half of all top executives  still are being recruited from outside the Southland -- 16% from overseas.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, recruiters say it has become common for executives from other  areas to turn down jobs because of Southern California's perceived problems.  </P> <P> "I've lost many candidates due to the fact the cost of living is too high or we  couldn't make a salary offer that matched the cost of living," said John  McFarland, senior personnel analyst for Executive Life Insurance Co. in West  Los Angeles.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Postage-Stamp Lot'  </P> <P> Headhunters tell stories of spouses -- wives, most often, of male executives  considering a move to Southern California -- who visit the area on a  house-hunting trip and are stunned to learn how little their housing dollars  will buy.  </P> <P> In other regions, Usher said, it's not unusual for a well paid executive to be  able to live on a half-acre or acre estate without having more than an hour's  commute to the office. Few areas in Southern California offer that opportunity,  he noted.  </P> <P> "The cost, emotionally, of coming into a postage-stamp lot . . . can be great,"  he said.  </P> <P> The National Assn. of Realtors reported only a day ago that median home prices  in Orange County, at $231,200, are the highest in the nation. The Los Angeles  area, at $191,200, ranked fourth. San Diego, at $157,200, ranked eighth. Prices  have climbed 20% to 30% or more annually throughout the region since the  mid-1980s.  </P> <P> Still, Southern California is not the only area where living costs may fast be  becoming prohibitive. ESL Inc., a Silicon Valley defense contractor, said  Wednesday that high land and housing costs and clogged freeways in Sunnyvale  may prompt it to move nearly a third of its operations to less congested  Livermore.  </P> <P> Companies have adopted a host of strategies to combat the Southland's soaring  housing costs -- nearly all of them expensive. According to the Russell  Reynolds survey, a majority of bigger firms pick up at least part of the cost  of selling executives' old homes and purchasing their new ones, while four in  10 pay for the services of a relocation consultant.  </P> <P> The bottom line: Over a third of relocations cost more than $40,000, according  to the survey.  </P> <P> Most companies, however, have not yet responded to one of the major obstacles  to executive relocation -- helping spouses find a new job. Fewer than one in  four offer such assistance, the survey found, though 81% of the respondents  said it was at least "somewhat" difficult to recruit executives whose wives  also are professionals.  </P> <P> Another growing problem, according to the survey, is convincing divorced  parents to relocate to Southern California when the move means leaving children  behind with a former spouse. The survey also reported that parents with  children of high school age resist relocating.  </P> <P> </P> <P> WEIGHING THE DECISION  </P> <P> Percent of personnel executives who say that a particular

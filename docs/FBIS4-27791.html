			<p>CSO     [Text] Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT), which had  applied for rate hikes averaging 18 percent on the basic charge  and additional hikes on the information call rate, reveals an  increased sense of crisis as it says, "If expected rate  increases are not approved in the fall, financial results for  this fiscal year will be fairly bad."    The operating program for fiscal year 1994, submitted for  approval at the end of February, projected recurring profits of  104 billion yen. The figure did not include the requested rate  hikes, making them little changed from the 106 billion yen in  recurring profits expected for fiscal year 1993. However,  inclusion of a special charge to cover voluntary retirements  will drop aftertax profits for fiscal year 1995 to 61 billion  yen. Since maintaining a 10-percent dividend payout rate will  require 78 billion yen, profits retained from fiscal year 1993  will have to be used to cover dividend payments.    NTT revised its new subscriber estimates for fiscal year  1993  from the initial 1.3 million connections to 1.2 million and  there is a strong possibility that it will revise downward as  well its fiscal year 1994 estimate of 1.2 million. Telephone  call revenues fell by 130 billion yen in fiscal year 1993 from  the prior year and are expected to drop another 90 billion yen  in fiscal year 1994, because long-distance call rates were  reduced to compete with the new common carriers.    President Hitoshi Kojima makes no attempt at concealing his  disappointment, asserting that NTT's applications for rate hikes  were "unavoidable measures after a series of cost-reduction  actions and reductions in long-distance call rates. We would  hope that our rate hike application will not be treated in the  same manner as other public utility rate increases."    Sources at the Telecommunications Bureau of the MOPT say,  "We  cannot conceive of NTT falling victim to deficits immediately,  but there is the potential of having difficulty maintaining the  current dividend rate or the fear of delaying improvements in  infrastructure such as the installation of optical fiber cables.</p>

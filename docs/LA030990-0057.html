			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> UCLA PLANS TO INCREASE ITS FACILITIES BY A THIRD  </P> <P> UCLA, looking to maintain its standing among major research and teaching  universities, unveiled an ambitious, long-range development plan Thursday that  would increase its total physical plant -- including classrooms, residential  space, offices and medical facilities -- by one third over the next 15 years.  </P> <P> The plan, announced by UCLA Chancellor Charles Young, involves a major foray  into university-owned land on the southwest end of Westwood Village. It  includes a residential village for 2,700 graduate students and faculty and a  much-disputed conference center on what is known as Lot 32, a finger of land  that reaches down from the main campus and abuts Wilshire Boulevard, west of  Gayley Avenue.  </P> <P> "UCLA has risen quickly to the ranks of the world's premier research  universities," Young said. The proposed expansion will enable it to "continue  that ascent and remain a valuable asset to the community" while acquiring the  staff and technology necessary "for us to make a contribution which is needed  in the 21st Century."  </P> <P> Despite assurances from Young that the plans would not adversely affect the  area, the announcement immediately raised concerns in the community about  traffic congestion and livability in one of Los Angeles' most crowded and  popular areas.  </P> <P> "The amount and the intensity of the plan may be more than the area can  handle," said Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, a UCLA graduate  whose district includes Westwood.  </P> <P> Young insisted, however, that the university's goals can be achieved without  increasing traffic. "We're prepared not only to state that can be done, but we  are prepared to live with the restriction" that there be no increase in  traffic, Young said.  </P> <P> The blueprint -- essentially a land-use plan -- also envisions building a new  600-patient hospital, with the existing Medical Center converted into offices  and auxiliary health services, including research space.  </P> <P> No dollar figure has been placed on the facilities, as each one must be  approved and funded separately over the years. The total, Young said, would be  "a lot. It's more than I'd like to go out and raise immediately."  </P> <P> The proposed UCLA construction must compete for limited state education funds.  The UC system is also pushing an ambitious plan to build three new campuses  that could drain away resources. Despite the planned building boom that could  add 4.45 million square feet to the current 13.3 million square feet of  facilities, Young denied that it is a plan for growth.  </P> <P> "It's not an expansion plan," Young said at a news conference on campus. "UCLA  is not in an expansion mode."  </P> <P> Only a minor increase in the student population is anticipated, he said. The  student body is expected to grow by about 1,500 from its 34,674 students now.  Faculty and staff population is expected to rise by about 4,000 in the next 15  years.  </P> <P> Young said the proposals are a necessity in UCLA's mission to continue to  attract top faculty and students by providing state-of-the art research  facilities and an intellectual milieu that fosters excellence. Faculty and  students are now squeezed into space that has long been inadequate, he said.  </P> <P> Community leaders, many of whom are among the Westside's slow-growth activists,  are not convinced that such major development would leave Westwood Village and  its neighbors untouched. Representatives of two homeowners' groups called  Young's assurances "ludicrous" and "a bad joke."  </P> <P> While applauding UCLA's goal of retaining its standing as a preeminent  university, Yaroslavsky said the goal must be accomplished in a "way that does  not undermine the quality of life of their neighbors."  </P> <P> Yaroslavsky said he is not convinced by Young's contentions that the plan would  not detract from the area.  </P> <P> "I think UCLA clearly has to be poised for some skepticism on the part of the  city and the community," he said. "It is impossible that 4 million square feet  of building is not going to generate traffic. It's hard to fathom."  </P> <P> According to a 1987 city transportation study, Wilshire Boulevard and Veteran  Avenue just east of the San Diego Freeway was the busiest intersection in Los  Angeles with 126,000 cars passing each day. Ed Rowe, general manager of the  city's Department of Transportation, estimated that the figure has grown  between 5% and 10% since then, with no end in sight.  </P> <P> In its promise not to add to this glut of cars, Young said the university will  gear up its already successful programs of car- and van-pooling. In addition,  the residential village, which was suggested to the school by community groups,  will reduce traffic because people who now commute to the campus will be able  to walk.  </P> <P> Young also noted that the long-range plan does not provide any new parking  spaces because "construction of parking places will generate more trips."  However, 3,000 already-approved parking spaces will be constructed; and where  parking lots are used for construction sites, those spaces will be replaced  elsewhere.  </P> <P> While acknowledging the university's claim of no added traffic was a "wild  card" that would be met with skepticism, Rowe said if such a feat is  accomplished anywhere in town, it will be at UCLA. "They have a model program  over there and an obvious commitment on the part of UCLA administration," he  said.  </P> <P> Two community leaders, however, took a different view.  </P> <P> "It's a massive amount of development, no matter how you look at it, in an area  that is already massively impacted," said Sandy Brown, vice president of  Westwood-Holmby Property Owners Assn. "To say that amount of development isn't  going to be noticeable in terms of impact is ludicrous."  </P> <P> Laura Lake, president of Friends of Westwood, rejected Young's contention that  the long-range plan could be accomplished without adversely affecting the  community. "This idea of not producing traffic is a bad joke," she said.  </P> <P> Homeowner groups are particularly concerned about the proposed Conference  Center, which would include up to 300 rooms for overnight guests attending  programs at the university. "I call it a hotel," Brown said. "UCLA doesn't need  to be in the hotel business, to derive money from someone sleeping overnight in  a facility they provide."  </P> <P> Young said the proposed Conference Center would not generate as much traffic as  a commercial hotel and would not cause the same impact to the community.  </P> <P> The word "hotel" is particularly sensitive in Westwood. The most contentious  issue in a hard-fought community plan that went into effect in January, 1989,  was whether the Village should have a new hotel, and if so, how big. One hotel  was approved for the Village proper, but UCLA's facility is just outside the  perimeter and it is not bound by the plan in any event.  </P> <P> A public hearing on the draft long-range development plan and its environmental  impact report is scheduled for April 4 at 7 p.m. at the Tennis Center on  campus.  </P> <P> The long-range development plan contains a commitment to preserve the "campus  in a garden" environment by protecting existing areas of open space and  creating plazas, courts, gardens and walkways in future developments on the  419-acre campus.  </P> <P> Among the new academic facilities proposed are an expansion of the law library,  which is already partially funded, an expansion of the Graduate School of  Architecture and Urban Planning, and new research space for the humanities and  life sciences programs.  </P> <P> A significant expansion of the existing studio, rehearsal and performance  facilities is proposed for the fine arts department, while obsolete engineering  facilities are slated for replacement. A 200,000-square-foot research library  is also on the university's wish list, as is state-of-the art research labs for  molecular biology and the physical sciences. An expanded child-care center is  also on the drawing boards.  </P> <P> Young said there are substantial financial obstacles that must be overcome  before the UCLA Medical Center can build a new facility for its patients. He  predicted that it will be the end of the decade before the facility is built.  No specific site is designated for the hospital, but Young said it will be near  the existing Medical Center.  </P> <P> The new facility would replace outdated hospital rooms that were built before  major technological advancements. Remodeling them would ultimately be more  costly than starting anew, he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> UCLA EXPANSION PLAN  </P> <P> Existing structures and expansion proposal for UCLA campus:  </P> <P> 1.)

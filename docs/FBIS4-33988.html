			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Manuel Alvarez Cedeno] </F>   [Text] The National Office for Attention to Refugees  [Oficina Nacional para la Atencion de los Refugiados, ONPAR] has  reported that, since the Haitian political crisis broke out two  years ago, approximately 200 Haitians have requested political  asylum in Panama, but only 27 have qualified to receive it.    ONPAR Director Jose Javier Mulino told LA PRENSA that, since  Jean-Bertrand Aristide was ousted, some 200 Haitians have  requested refuge in Panama and that, of these, only 27 have  qualified and nine cases are currently under study.    "We studied all the requests and confirmed that only 27 are  classified as victims of political persecution by the regime of  dictator Raoul Cedras," Mulino explained. The ONPAR conducts  these analyses jointly with officials of the Endara  administration and the UNHCR office. Mulino explained that to  obtain political asylum the person must prove he is truly being  politically persecuted.</p>

			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Further setback as selling increases THE ABSENCE of US buyers, in spite of Wall Street's return from the Labor Day holiday, together with a sell-off in stock index futures, depressed the London stock market again yesterday. The September contract on the Footsie index fell to an unnerving five-point discount at midsession without the underlying blue chip equities attracting the arbitrage support associated with such operations. After moving narrowly at first, the stock market turned down smartly in the afternoon, the FT-SE 100 closing 20.4 points off at 3,038.6. The index is now around 2.5 per cent down from its recent trading peak, reached on August 27. In addition to caution over near-term prospects for UK stocks, the London market appeared to be somewhat less optimistic ahead of tomorrow's meeting of the Bundesbank policy council. If the German central bank does not cut rates, this will undermine hopes of an early reduction in UK base rates and disappoint UK investors. The launch by Mercury, the telecommunications group majority owned by Cable and Wireless, of a new mobile phone service on favourable terms to Londoners brought strong reaction among its rivals, which scented a vicious price war. BT gave ground, as did Vodafone. C&amp;W drew no benefit from Mercury's plans, however, falling sharply on fears of impending political developments in Hong Kong, a factor which also unsettled HSBC. Sentiment was also again unsettled by company trading statements which, while not bringing new disasters yesterday, continued to provide little evidence for the benefits of economic recovery at corporate level. In early trading, the stock market was unimpressed by profits news from Fisons, the pharmaceutical and scientific equipment group, and also from Williams Holdings and Hillsdown Holdings. At BZW, Mr Richard Kersley commented that last week's corporate news had brought surprises, 'the bulk of them unpleasant', adding that, with stocks trading on aggressive price/earnings multiples, there was little cushion to absorb bad news. There was little support for the international blue chips. Glaxo, the drugs group, which reports final results tomorrow, remained under the bearish influence of a leading agency stockbroker, and the rest of the pharmaceuticals sector continued to lack the buyers who were driving prices ahead at the end of last month. Oil shares, too, suffered as a weak crude oil price kept investors out of the sector. Although selling pressure was increased across the range of equities, traders believed that the outlook for stocks at these levels remains sound. As expected, retail, or customer, business in UK equities fell away sharply on Monday, when New York was closed, returning a total of only Pounds 811.4m. This is the first time the daily total has dropped below Pounds 1bn in genuine trading for nearly a year. Seaq business increased to 626.2m shares yesterday from 421.1m in the previous session, with non-Footsie trades making up 60 per cent of the total. Yesterday's Seaq volume was at the low end of recent daily figures. The UK institutions appeared to be keeping out of the market, and overseas investors making only very selective forays into equities.</p>

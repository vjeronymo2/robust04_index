			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Gold The price of frankincense and myrrh may be impossible to chart; that of gold has been moving up quite nicely recently. After the spell of profit-taking which saw it retreat sharply from its year's highs of around Dollars 410 in August, the metal is climbing back towards Dollars 400. That may seem surprising in view of the retail consumer resistance that developed in the Far East at the higher price levels, but other seasonal and not-so seasonal factors are helping demand. Not only is demand boosted by buying ahead of the Chinese New year and Indian wedding season; the low oil price has perversely stimulated retail buying by Middle Eastern investors worried about a possible devaluation of their currencies. Jewellery demand has also picked up slightly in the US, thanks to the economic recovery. As for supply, South African producers seem reluctant to step up their forward sales while the price is rising, and it will be some time before new discoveries in countries such as Venezuela and Ghana come on stream. The fundamentals could thus sustain a further price increase, provided it is not too violent to scare consumers. One theory about the way in which Far Eastern demand dried up in the summer was based on the sheer speed with which the metal approached Dollars 400 rather than the absolute price it reached. The risk, though, is that speculative pressures could again cause the price to overshoot. Moreover, while the weak oil price appears to have helped the metal so far, things would change if any producing country was forced to sell bullion from its reserves. That, together with the prospect of central banks cashing in options profits at higher prices, means gold may struggle to break decisively through its closing peak of Dollars 414 during the Gulf War.</p>

			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Kohl plays down his party's plans for multi-speed EU Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany has sought to quell a diplomatic storm over his ruling Christian Democrat party's proposals to create a 'hard core' of five nations in a multi-speed European Union. After the UK joined protests from Denmark and Italy, Mr Kohl distanced himself publicly yesterday from the proposals put forward last week by Mr Wolfgang Schauble, parliamentary leader of the CDU-CSU coalition group. Mr Dieter Vogel, chief government spokesman, disclosed that Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, had telephoned Mr Kohl yesterday and that the Chancellor had reassured him, along with other EU leaders, that the CDU-CSU paper was not official German policy. 'It is not a paper which has been agreed with the government,' said Mr Vogel. He said Mr Berlusconi was 'satisfied with the explanation'. However, Italian officials expressed surprise that Mr Kohl had failed to step in earlier. Speculation grew in European capitals that Mr Kohl may have given the paper his unofficial blessing, in order to float a 'trial balloon' ahead of the 1996 inter-governmental conference to review the Maastricht treaty. Several of the chancellor's closest advisers are known to favour a public debate to head off misunderstandings and reach clear decisions on future EU integration at the 1996 conference. The CDU-CSU paper calls for France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg to press ahead faster with European integration. A day before it was published, Mr Edouard Balladur, French prime minister, suggested a 'three-tier' Europe with the Franco-German alliance at its core; but he did not name names. On Friday, the Italian foreign ministry warned that the CDU-CSU paper could risk the 'break-up' of the EU. Mr Klaus Kinkel, German foreign minister and head of the FDP liberal party, the government coalition partner, condemned the paper. Mr John Major, the prime minister, intends to deliver a riposte in a speech on Europe in the Netherlands tomorrow. He is expected to argue that instead of a single hard core there should be different permutations of countries pressing ahead with integration according to their priorities. A senior UK official explained: 'The notion of first- or second-class citizens is not a concept that we think is valid or can be sustained.' Publication of the CDU/CSU paper appears to end the truce on constitutional debate, reopening questions about Maastricht which struck a balance between community-wide obligations and looser co-operation between EU governments in areas such as foreign and defence policy.</p>

			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / International Company News: Commonwealth Bank lifts profits 8% COMMONWEALTH Bank of Australia, the partially privatised, Sydney-based institution, yesterday reported an 8.4 per cent rise in after-tax profits to ADollars 443.1m (USDollars 295.4m) for the 12 months ended June. Profit before restructuring costs and general provision transfers was ADollars 492.3m. The figures, at the upper end of analysts' expectations, pave the way for the sale of a further 19 per cent equity interest in the bank by the federal government. This move, already well-flagged, will reduce the authorities' holding in CBA from 70 per cent to 51 per cent. Yesterday, Mr Tim Besley, CBA chairman, said that he expected details of the sale to be released 'in a matter of a few days'. The sale is expected to raise around ADollars 1.5bn. Operating profit after tax but before outside equity interests and abnormal items rose to ADollars 589.5m from ADollars 415.9m, with the core banking operations contributing ADollars 482.6m, against ADollars 385.3m. The bad debt charge fell to ADollars 533.7m from ADollars 843m, which CBA attributed to 'concerted action . . . to manage non-performing loans, as well as the benefits of the recovery in the equities market'. However, at the earnings per share level, there was more modest progress, with CBA reporting 51.7 cents, against 51.5 cents last time. Mr David Murray, managing director, admitted that there was a 'continuing subdued economic environment,' with increased competition among lenders in a sluggish domestic market. But he said that CBA's relatively healthy figures reflected tighter control on costs, with operating expenses falling by 6 per cent. The bank's risk-weighted capital ratio improved from 9.84 per cent to 10.66 per cent. Total assets rose to ADollars 91bn from ADollars 88.3bn. CBA shares rose 35 cents on news of the results, to ADollars 9.95.</p>

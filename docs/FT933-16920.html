			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Observer: Fellow traveller At risk of damning him with faint praise, Chris Green, managing director of British Rail's InterCity subsidiary, enjoys a reputation as one of the railway's brightest sparks. All the more bizarre, then, to find him going out on a limb yesterday by publishing his own rather eccentric version of InterCity's annual results. His motives look simple enough. By defying the new (and entirely commendable) accounting standards adopted by the British Railways Board, he has created the illusion that his profits have gone up instead of down. But what on earth can have been going through his mind to make him think people would fall for such a ploy? Unfortunately Observer was unable to ask him because he had gone on holiday to Turkey, leaving Sir Bob Reid, BR's hapless chairman, to sort out the mess. Let us hope it is a long and restful break, and that Green comes back more like his old self. Heaven knows, privatisation poses enough problems for BR without one of its most respected and influential managers going off the rails.</p>

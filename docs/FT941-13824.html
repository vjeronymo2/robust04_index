			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / MPs to debate policy openness MPs to debate policy openness MPs will this week consider a Tory backbencher's bill which seeks to inject more openness into the process of making monetary policy. Mr Nicholas Budgen, MP for Wolverhampton South West, is proposing that the Treasury's periodic instructions to the Bank of England should be published. His bill would also force a government that wished to change its chief objective of monetary policy from price stability to draft a parliamentary order.</p>

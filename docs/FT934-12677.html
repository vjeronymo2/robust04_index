			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Clutching at straws in the off-year polls: Jurek Martin assesses the role of the great tax revolt, women's card and religious right in the US local elections THE larger straws in the wind of off-year elections are always earnestly clutched, if at times not firmly. This year, while the New York mayoral race is, as ever, sui generis, the races for governor in Virginia and New Jersey and a number of tax and social issue ballots, notably in the west, form the basis for discerning national trends. The leading questions that may be answered on November 2 include: Is the great tax revolt really over and are Americans resigned to the inevitability of having to pay more locally as well as nationally? If Governor Jim Florio, a Democrat, is returned in New Jersey, an affirmative case will exist. The jury may be split, however, if a majority of anti-tax initiatives in over 20 states carry. If last year saw women make great strides in elections, will this year's suggest it was a fluke? A defeat for Mary Sue Terry in Virginia and Christine Todd Whitman in New Jersey, both early favourites, will be adduced to suggest it was, though neither have seriously played the women's card. Is the religious right on the rise again after serious setbacks in 1992? A victory in Virginia for George Allen, especially if complemented by a win for his lieutenant-governor running mate, might imply it is, at least in its southern base. The expected defeat for the school voucher proposition in California would suggest the reverse, though the margin will be closely watched. In reality, as Tip O'Neill, former Speaker of the House, used to say 'all politics is local'. But the Florio-Whitman match-up has attracted wider attention not only because New Jersey is a big bellwether state. It has drawn into the fray two of the most skilled political operatives, James Carville, of Clinton campaign fame, to Mr Florio, and Ed Rollins, the Republican who flirted with Ross Perot last year, to Mrs Whitman. It has also been, remarkably, as much a battle of ideas as personalities. Two years ago, having steeply increased state taxation, Mr Florio was probably the most unpopular man in the state, even suffering the mortification of seeing the Democrats lose control of the legislature. Having enforced some gun control and vetoed attempts at repeal, he was a prime target of the National Rifle Association and its vast resources. Yet he has had the brass nerve to run on his record, which might be described as Clintonite even before Bill Clinton became president. He has unashamedly welcomed the president and his wife to New Jersey just when other Democratic aspirants were turning the other way. Mrs Whitman, barely known when she nearly beat the popular incumbent Senator Bill Bradley in 1990, seemed to be riding a tide, easily ahead in the polls earlier in the year. But she took a chunk of the summer off, saw her campaign organisation get involved in unseemly spats and often seemed stiff in debate against Mr Florio, not for nothing a former boxer. Most controversially she said it was still possible to cut state taxes (by 10 per cent a year for three years). Her plan received some approval - from Forbes magazine, for example, though this may be because its publisher, Steve Forbes, helped design it. But it provided a ripe target for Mr Florio, something of a Lazarus if his current 5-15 point polling lead holds up. Like Mrs Whitman, Mary Sue Terry in Virginia suffers from being apparently less warm and lovable than her male opponent, but this is hardly because of her sex. A former state attorney general, she is as close as it comes to being a female 'good ol' boy', with a lifetime in the smoke-filled rooms of Virginia Democratic party politics. She could hardly be more different from one of last year's female successes, Mrs Patty Murray, who won election to the Senate from Washington state last year by campaigning as 'the mom in tennis shoes'. Her career as a professional politician is part of the Terry problem. The state has moved on a lot since it was run by the reactionary Byrd Democratic machine. It has a Democratic black governor, Doug Wilder, and a progressive Democratic senator, Chuck Robb. Its expanding northern suburbs, near Washington, are nothing like as conservative as the old south. But new Virginia Democrats are forever falling out, as was evident from the vicious Wilder-Robb feud, leaving Ms Terry, perhaps for the first time, very much on her political own. Nevertheless she, too, held big leads, of up to 30 points, over George Allen, all of which and maybe more, has apparently evaporated. A conservative Republican state legislator, Mr Allen and the Republican candidate for lieutenant-governor, Michael Farris, who are not paired on the ballot paper, are indisputably of the right, anointed at a convention dominated by religious fundamentalists and their new secular hero, Lt Col Oliver North, the architect of Iran-Contra who is eying the Senate next year. Ms Terry, over-emphasising the negative with some indifferent commercials, has tried to make Mr Farris, the harder right of the two, and Mr North the bogeymen of the race. Mr Allen, genial and an effective campaigner, has countered by talking 'issues' - ending parole for prisoners, cracking down on crime and slashing the state budget but with only a modest recourse, on his own account, to invocations of the Lord. Out west various education propositions long on the right wing wish-list would make easier the maintenance of private, often religious, schools. In California, Governor Pete Wilson, the ambitious Republican whose stock is also rising, a la Florio, from the depths, is leading the opposition. In Washington, Bill Gates of Microsoft has given Dollars 80,000 to the fight against two anti-tax initiatives on the grounds that they would destroy state higher education. 'This dwarfs all my previous political contributions,' he said, demonstrating that at least one American is taking these off-year elections very seriously indeed.</p>

			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Mercury poisoning company told to pay A Japanese regional court yesterday ordered a chemical company which dumped mercury into the sea in southern Japan during the 1950s to compensate those poisoned as a result, but ruled that the central and municipal governments were not to blame in the case. In the latest ruling in a series of lawsuits against the government and Chisso, the chemicals maker, the Osaka District Court ordered a total of Y276m (Pounds 1.8m) in damages to be paid to 42 of the 59 claimants. The group filed a claim 12 years ago, and 16 have already died. Although nearly 40 years have passed since the first report of disease, more than 2,500 patients and families of dead victims are still seeking compensation from the government at three high courts and six district courts. The lawsuits have become ensnared in Japan's slow-moving legal system, and the government refuses to settle the cases out of court. The disease, a paralysis of the central nervous system caused by eating mercury-polluted fish caught near the town of Minamata, became one of Japan's worst pollution cases and caused a widespread outcry. The government has recognised only 3,000 patients as official victims of the disease out of 13,000 people who claim to be sufferers. The court yesterday rejected allegations that the central and Kumamoto municipal governments were responsible for protecting the lives and health of Minamata residents, and therefore were responsible for not ordering Chisso to stop discharging water contaminated with mercury into the sea. It is the third out of six district court rulings which dismiss claims of government responsibility, and some plaintiffs are calling for Mr Tomiichi Murayama, the new prime minister, to seek a settlement of the suits. Meanwhile, the plaintiffs' lawyers said they would appeal against the finding to the high court.</p>

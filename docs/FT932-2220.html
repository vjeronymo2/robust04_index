			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Anger as Irish president meets Sinn Fein chief: UK government concerned over Belfast visit A MEETING yesterday be-tween Mrs Mary Robinson, the Irish president, and Mr Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, provoked scarcely disguised fury in Downing Street. The brief, private meeting took place at a college assembly hall in west Belfast, where Mr Adams, among 70 representatives of the area, held out his hand and greeted Mrs Robinson in Irish. Just hours later the Northern Ireland Office said the Irish president was not in the province at the government's invitation. She was there in a private capacity. 'The UK government took steps to make clear that its concern about aspects of the visit - including its planning  - were made known at the highest level in the Irish government,' it said in a statement. Outraged protests by Unionist politicians underlined the added difficulties now facing Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, in seeking to persuade the Unionists to take part in further talks on new democratic structures for the province. Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist party, called on Mr John Major, the prime minister, to make an official protest to Dublin about the 'behaviour' of the Irish head of state. He accused her of acting as if she were the head of state of Northern Ireland and giving 'a propaganda boost to the IRA'. While refraining from public comment, Downing Street emphasised that the British government's only role had been to ensure adequate security for Mrs Robinson during the meeting. Another source of irritation was that Mrs Robinson chose to meet Mr Adams within 48 hours of Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, being told at a meeting with Mr Major in London about the efforts being made to persuade the Ulster Unionists to take part in fresh talks. Mr Adams maintained that British politicians had tried to sabotage the Irish president's two-day visit to the province. He claimed that both the British and Irish governments must have seen and approved the guest list. Mrs Robinson said after the meeting that west Belfast had shown her 'the strength, the vitality, the energy and the commitment and the dedication of their community. 'Nobody was hogtying or trying to make a political meeting out of it.' Her action was defended by Mr Kevin McNamara, shadow Northern Ireland secretary. He said: 'Mrs Robinson was on a private visit to west Belfast where she met a resident of west Belfast.'</p>

			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAP-THE POWER AND THE CONTROVERSY;  </P> <P> CHUCK D. -- THE INTERVIEW  </P> <P> Chuck D. was interviewed by pop music critic Robert Hilburn in a New York  recording studio as Public Enemy finished work on its third album, "Fear of a  Black Planet." Rap's most acclaimed and controversial figure speaks candidly  about the uproar surrounding his group, his music, his personal politics and  the role of rap music in America.  </P> <P> Hilburn: How fairly do you think you have been portrayed in the media -- the  accusations of anti-Semitism in the band and so forth?  </P> <P> Chuck D.: Everybody's not here to like you. . . . I think the key to being a  wise black man in this hemisphere is in knowing that what you do is going to  turn some people off because your perspective is different from others. You've  got to (tell yourself), "No matter what I do, they're not going to see it from  my eyes."  </P> <P> Let's look at your perspective. What first got you interested in music? Who  were your heroes as a kid?  </P> <P> My heroes and role models came from sports. . . . Basketball . . . baseball . .  . football. . . . People like Hank Aaron, Willie Mays, Willis Reed, Gale Sayers  . . . a lot of black heroes.  </P> <P> But my main man was Muhammad Ali. He was one of the first black men to come  along and speak his mind. He'd go like, "Yo, not only did I whip this kid's ass  (in the ring), but I'm smart. I look good. You can't push me around." Some  people didn't like the fact that after he won, he thanked God and his religion.  It was something they didn't understand.  </P> <P> I think that a lot of people in America are really happy that Muhammad Ali is  in the condition that he is in (Ali has been diagnosed as having Parkinson's  syndrome) because back when he was in top-notch condition, yelling and stuff,  (a lot of white people) didn't like him. They'd say, "I wish he would shut up."  Reggie Jackson was another articulate brother who not only would beat you on  the field, but he would (speak up in interviews) and say, "Yo, this is the way  I did it."  </P> <P> Did watching them inspire you -- and tell you about the dangers of being  outspoken?  </P> <P> Sure, it showed what happens when you rock the boat, but I think that if we sit  still in the boat, we ain't going to get nowhere. The thing I saw in these  sports heroes was that they were men. My father was my number one hero because  he was a man, too. That's why all this that comes down today (around Public  Enemy) doesn't bother me because I'm a man. Respect me as a man and I'll  respect you.  </P> <P> There's a lot of social commentary in your music. When did you start thinking  about the world in those terms?  </P> <P> My mom was active in lots of community-oriented things (on Long Island), and  she put me into these special summer school (programs) when I was around 11 or  12 and they taught us a lot about black history. In the beginning, it was fun  because we were getting free sandwiches and apples and going to the pool, but  we learned all kinds of other things that were helpful to me later . . . about  the black community pulling together. . . .  </P> <P> Rappers can do a lot of good because we have control of the media and that's  why we're not liked because never before has the black man or so many black  males spoken their opinion on so many things.  </P> <P> Before (the message to blacks was), "You can do all kinds of crazy (expletive)  on the basketball court, on the baseball field, then you can be a white boy's  hero."  </P> <P> Today, the problem is that people like Ice Cube or BDP are white boy's heroes,  but they aren't just dealing from a physical thing, but a mental thing.  </P> <P> Because of the problems your group went through last year, did you identify  with the controversy involving N.W.A and the FBI's attack on their music?  </P> <P> I understood what they were going through because it was the same thing most  black people go through. If you have a (door) to the media and people don't  understand what you are saying, people are going to come at you in all  directions . . . and all (we both were doing) was addressing what is going on  in our minds, what we see . . . asking questions.  </P> <P> What were your goals in the first album?  </P> <P> I tried to relate, "This is how we are thinking and how we are living on the  block." If someone wants to know what the problem is with black America today,  they'll go to some kind of social analyst who is making about $100,000 a year,  living in a certain neighborhood and he's going to try to come from a point of,  "This is what I see is wrong with the black situation."  </P> <P> What were you saying in the lyrics on the first album?  </P> <P> I was tackling issues, things I thought needed explaining. I remember back at  that time, the media threw a lot of (expletive) at Run-DMC for the gang  violence at the Long Beach concert. They blamed rap for violence and I thought  that's crazy. How in the hell can they blame a music for violence when this is  a situation that was festering in that area for years? It's a social situation.  It ain't got nothing to do with rap. . . .  </P> <P> That's when I decided to get involved in this and go head on head and toe to  toe with the media because the media took a smack at rap music and Run-DMC  because they didn't understand what was really going on in black life.  </P> <P> So, I decided to play a little game on the media. I set traps for them. When I  wrote, "My Uzi Weighs a Ton," I wanted to see people come out and say, "Damn,  he's talking about Uzis" and start thinking about people walking around with  real Uzis -- and they did it. Lots of people thought it was irresponsible, us  talking about arming blacks and marching around with Uzis.  </P> <P> Isn't there danger in that? Shouldn't you try to say things that people  understand, rather than say things that confuse them?  </P> <P> No, because I might say things that the media understands or the average white  man understands, but then I might not be communicating with the black audience,  which is my main audience.  </P> <P> When people started asking about Uzis, did you feel you were able to explain  your feelings?  </P> <P> I know the message got out to my audience. There might have been a few brothers  who thought, "Hell, yes" and liked the idea of carrying a gun, but I know that  85 to 90% felt, "Yo, we know what he's saying." I know people keep saying, "Why  don't you be perfectly clear?" Well, that's not rap because black society isn't  perfectly clear to the white world. If you are speaking primarily to the black  community, you are going to always run into problems with the white world.  </P> <P> Why the military outfits on stage and the imitation Uzis?  </P> <P> The idea came partly from the Black Panthers, which remains such a strong image  in the black community. You've got to understand, the Black Panthers were  looked upon as terrorists by the white community, but much of the black  community looked upon them as heroes.  </P> <P> The guns on stage symbolize why black people are in the situation they are in  today. . . . the Europeans had the guns and took us out of Africa and sent us  to America. The guns are us saying, "OK, never again is our culture going to be  snatched away from us the way it was before."  </P> <P> What about the second album? Which themes were most important to you in "It  Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back"?  </P> <P> That album was addressed right at the black community, the need to get our  (expletive) together, to network, because no one is going to do it for us. The  next album, which is "Fear of a Black Planet," is going to talk about what  Caucasians believe about themselves.  </P> <P> For me, I don't believe in black and white. There is no such thing. I believe  that the original black man from Africa was the original seed and everything  sprouted from there. If you want to look into genetics, the black man is able  to reproduce everything on the color wheel . . . blond hair, blue eyes, light  skin.  </P> <P> The only reason people talk about separation is because the white world  supremacists keep saying the white race is pure and that anything that mixes  with it contaminates it. It's rooted in a lot of religions today and even in  the law. If you decide to be with a black woman, your child is black.  </P> <P> That second album was also information for the white audience to check out. The  idea wasn't to exclude the white audience, but the title shows who it was  addressed to. . . . The thinking: Our strength is in ourselves. The challenge  is working against the people who want to hold us back.  </P> <P> How did you feel when it was hailed by critics?  </P> <P> For a lot of "white" people to say, "Damn, I've learned something about the  black perspective," it was gratifying. I'm hu-man, I feel good when someone  says, "Great job."  </P> <P> But you must realize some people just respond to the music, not the themes. Is  that enough for you?  </P> <P> I think music should be regarded No. 1 as communication. That's what all us  rappers are -- communicators. That's why a lot of people react so strongly  against us.  </P> <P> But pop music and soul music have a history of artists who have stressed  socially conscious themes. What about Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, Curtis  Mayfield?  </P> <P> But all that was just singing. It's not as direct. With rap, there is no way to  miss the point of the song.  </P> <P> What about the Griff situation and the Washington Times interview?  </P> <P> I felt something was going to come down. I think Griff was disillusioned about  a lot of things going on with his position (in the group). In the interview, he  was trying to deal with this guy, talking about capitalistic exploitation of  black people in South Africa and the involvement of different governments and  he didn't have his facts down to a T. He was wrong.  </P> <P> But why not remove Griff and just do away with the whole racism and  anti-Semitic image, which is going to detract from the positive message that  you feel is in your music?  </P> <P> Because, you don't remove it as an issue by getting rid of Griff. You might  remove it as an issue with you or with the Jewish constituency or the white  public, but I told you I am mainly talking to my community, the black  community, and they look at us a some kind of a hero.  </P> <P> So when you fire Griff, they go, "Yo, you gave in to the white boy. . . .  You're no different than everybody else. What kind of a leader are you?" The  important thing to me was to make it clear that I thought what Griff said was  wrong, but to also show that we can forgive. Griff was called for traveling, so  he had to be penalized, but that doesn't mean he had to be cut off the team.  </P> <P> So, how do you comment on what Griff said? What do you say when someone asks if  you're racist or anti-Semitic?  </P> <P> "NBC Nightly News" asked me that the other night and they wanted to see me  sweat, but I don't feel any guilt. I'm not racist. I'm not anti-Semitic. I  think it is a waste of time being anti-anything.  </P> <P> But I also won't let this (controversy) keep me, as a black nationalist, from  talking about problems of the black people and asking questions about how these  problems came about. What is happening now is that people are looking at the  Griff comments and reading racism or anti-Semitic thoughts in everything we do,  like the "Terrordome" single.  </P> <P> I'm not a racist, but I am inquisitive and I hope that when I keep asking  questions, people don't respond to them by saying it's a racist question  because there is no such thing as a racist question. There are only racist  answers.  </P> <P> What does it mean to you to be a black nationalist?  </P> <P> Black nationalist means that since we are viewed upon as a separate  constituency that is judged by our characteristics instead of our character, it  means we have to network among each other.  </P> <P> If we were able to say, "Hey, I'm black and I'm American, but an American  first," white people are not going to see us that way. They see us first as  black and then deal with us from there. In view of that, we have to network  with other black people for our own protection and self interest.  </P> <P> Is your dream an equal society?  </P> <P> That'll happen once whites have a better understanding of blacks. Now you have  a problem of white people running away, like we are aliens or something.  </P> <P> Are you calling for separatism?  </P> <P> I'm looking for separate development so that we can get to the level of the  rest of society. We've got to create our own businesses and future so that we  don't always have to be in the position of going to the white man for a job.  </P> <P> What was the message of "Terrordome'?  </P> <P> It was my perspective on what happened in 1989 in black America and also what  happened to Public Enemy.  </P> <P> The most controversial line in the song is the reference to crucifixion. Didn't  you realize that you would rekindle the whole anti-Semitic controversy and also  get accused of taking yourself too seriously by comparing what you went through  to Christ?  </P> <P> I'm an artist and that's my imagery. You can't let your artistry be intimidated  by the fear that people are going to misinterpret you. To me, there's a bit of  paranoia going on here. I was talking about a media crucifixion.  </P> <P> In light of the attack on the record, would you have taken the crucifixion  lines out of the record if you were making it again today?  </P> <P> Hell no. There's nothing offensive in that record at all. But the media keeps  asking me about the Jewish community, hoping I'll say something that gives them  another good story. But how can I blame the Jewish community? There are certain  factions in the community that are looking out for the best interests of the  whole community. They are doing what they are supposed to do.  </P> <P> If black people were to get hostile at implications and assumptions, hell man,  white people would be on the edge every second.  </P> <P> What's the new album's message? Is it going to make white people edgy?  </P> <P> The thing I'm asking is, "Why do whites run from blacks?" I call it the Jackass  Theory: Just acting Caucasian kills a simple solution. As long as white people  believe they are white and pure, they will treat us as something different. My  great-grandfather is white, but I'm black and what difference does it make? But  in white eyes it means my great-grandfather and his kids were contaminated so  they was basically knocked out of the game.  </P> <P> The day that white people stop acting white and start acting more human, in the  sense that we are all in this (expletive) together, we will come to some point  where everybody will get a piece of the pie.  </P> <P> Did you get any pressure from CBS Records about the lines in "Terrordome?"  </P> <P> They try to give me pressure, but I say, "You don't like me, you cut me off and  I'm out of here tomorrow. My next album will go bootleg gold." But they don't  want to cut off a million-plus sales.  </P> <P> CBS understands what I'm doing. If I went to the company and said, "White  people need to die tomorrow, Jews are (messing in our affairs)" . . . if I had  a twisted mentality like that, I would expect CBS to react differently.  </P> <P> I know they are under pressure from some groups, but the only thing they can  point to about the anti-Semitism issue is the Griff interview and their  interpretation of four lines in a song. I have explained those lines, but still  some people refuse to accept it.  </P> <P> Do you get strength from the black community?  </P> <P> I'm very proud of what I get from the black community because I think once I  told people, "Don't believe the hype no matter how much news the white media  throws at 'em," the kids know not to believe that bull. The point of "Fear of a  Black Planet" is like, hey, we are all in this together. My great-grandfather  was white. It wasn't like his kids died. His kids were just considered black.  The so-called white male wants to see the image of himself. If he doesn't see  the image of himself, he thinks, "Oh man, my family tree is poisoned."  </P> <P> The racist view of white people in the Western world is the same Aryan  principle, where Aryan people used to check the bloodline. If you had any kind  of Jewish infiltration in your blood, you weren't pure. Black people didn't  have anything to do with that. But people seem to want to blame black people  for some (things) that white people did in Germany and Europe.  </P> <P> My No. 1 question in "Fear of a Black Planet": Is white America ready to deal  with the rise of black male intellectualism and black male capitalism? Because  once a brother gets into hustling, they are going to win. Once a brother gets  into anything, because it's that extra drive we've got because we get beat down  in so many areas.  </P> <P> Did you think there was a time when you thought you might not be able to battle  back?  </P> <P> I understand it's all an intellectual game (dealing with the media and  criticism). . . . The minute you wilt intellectually, you lose. You can't get  intimidated. You've got to fight for what you believe in as long as you're  right.  </P></p>

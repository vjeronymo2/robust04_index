			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Rover to increase Discovery production by 20% Rover Group announced a Pounds 68m investment programme yesterday to expand production of its highly successful four-wheel-drive Land Rover Discovery. The project, which will increase capacity at the Solihull factory producing the car, is to be completed early next year. The announcement marks the first substantial investment programme to be launched by Rover since it was taken over by German car maker BMW at the start of the year. Rover executives stressed last night that the project would be financed from Rover's own earnings. There would be no contribution from BMW, which bought Rover for Pounds 800m plus debt assumptions and which pledged to allow Rover to operate autonomously. 'It had been envisaged for some time, before the BMW takeover in fact, that the investment would be necessary in order to meet soaring demand,' Rover said. The expansion will allow Land Rover, the Rover group's four-wheel-drive subsidiary, to increase production of the Discovery by 20 per cent to 1,500 a week and confirm it as one of the most successful vehicles ever to be launched by Rover, formerly BL. The model was launched in 1989 at a production rate of 270 a week and within a few months became the UK's best selling four-wheel-drive model. Since then production has been increased a total of nine times, creating an extra 1,600 jobs at the Solihull factory, which now employs 9,700. It is expected that the latest expansion will create some further jobs, although Rover said last night it was too early to say how many. Discovery sales last year reached 36,433 vehicles world-wide, representing half of Land Rover's total sales. Its image is sufficiently good for Honda, which is still collaborating with Rover despite the BMW takeover, to sell the vehicle under its own name, the Honda Crossroads, in Japan. The expansion is one of the biggest spending projects on a single plant to be announced by Rover in recent years. The increase in production is designed partly to cater for demand in the North American market, where the Discovery was launched only three months ago.</p>

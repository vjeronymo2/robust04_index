			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / Markets (At A Glance): Barratt offers 8.5% mortgage Barratt, the building company, is offering 8.5 per cent mortgages fixed for three years on its houses. It claims this is the cheapest rate for 14 years. Several lenders are currently offering mortgages fixed for three years at less than 10 per cent, but Barratt's offer undercuts almost all competition by a clear percentage point. The deal applies to new Barratt homes at 200 developments nationwide, and older houses the company has taken in part-exchange for purchases. Mortgages of up to Pounds 60,000 in the south east, and Pounds 50,000 elsewhere, are covered by the deal, which is offered to buyers who reserve a home between August 25 and September 30, and exchange contracts by October 16. Three-year mortgage redundancy protection insurance is available for loans of up to Pounds 100,000.</p>

			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Action group enters fray - Knight Williams The battle lines are drawn between Knight Williams, one of the UK's largest independent financial advisers, selling mainly to the retired, and its most disgruntled customers, the Knight Williams Investors Action Group. The field is also strewn with MPs, the Treasury, the Consumers' Association, the Securities and Investments Board which is the chief regulator for financial services, and Fimbra, the self-regulating body for independent financial advisers. What is it all about? The MPs, who include Sir David Steel, the former Liberal leader, last week tabled an all-party early day motion in the House of Commons. It read: 'This house is concerned by the number of complaints received from constituents, many of them retired people, who are dissatisfied at the service they have received from Knight Williams which has resulted in constituents suffering varying degrees of loss. It is also concerned about the apparent inability of the Sib and Fimbra to bring full light to bear on the subject and urges the government to institute a thorough inquiry into the whole matter.' The action group has submitted an analysis of 125 complaints to the Treasury. What does KW say? It has accused three of the MPs - John Gunnell, Sir Anthony Grant and Sir Geoffrey Johnson Smith - of having vested interests in signing the early-day motion, because of their links respectively with Yorkshire Fund managers, Barclays Bank and Eagle Star. It says these are competitors which could view KW as a 'potential acquisition'. What is their response? Eagle Star: 'The concept of being in competition with KW is a very fanciful notion - we are chalk and cheese.' Barclays: 'We don't see ourselves as competitors of KW and it is mischievous to suggest that.' What are investors' complaints? The action group is giving no details because it does not want KW to 'pick people off one by one.' However, KW has been the subject of considerable press criticism. Which?, the Consumer Association's monthly magazine, has run case studies involving accusations of inappropriate investments, 'churning' - encouraging customers to sell their investments needlessly and buy KW funds to earn the adviser commission - and of lack of independence. Its target market, the elderly, is seen as very vulnerable to abuse. Charges on its unit trusts are the highest in the industry with an initial charge of 6.39 per cent and an annual charge of 2.5 per cent. What is KW's reply? It says some customers panicked and sold after world markets fell in the aftermath of the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait but that those who stayed with KW have more than made good their losses. It also says that complaints are small compared to its customer base of 24,000; of the 218 Fimbra-registered complaints, it has been found at fault in 21. However, Fimbra suggested that it strengthen its compliance function with an appointment which had Fimbra's approval. KW recently appointed Colin Pinnell, formerly head of legal services at Fimbra, to oversee its legal and compliance department. KW says its charges are not high when you compare them to the discretionary portfolio management service of any broker. More than 80 per cent of its customers are put into its funds. I thought you said it was an IFA? Under the current rules, an IFA (and many stockbrokers are IFAs) can run in-house funds and advise their clients to invest in them. Fimbra is meant to monitor any potential conflict of interest. KW, which used to pay its advisers higher commission for selling KW funds than others, stopped this last year and, since March, says it has put its 120 or so advisers on salaries. It says that since it gets other investment houses (including James Capel, Gerrard Vivian Gray, Mercury, Lazard, Schroder and Baring), to manage the funds in a way similar to broker bond funds, it fulfils its role as an IFA. What are broker bonds? With a broker bond fund, clients' money is invested in life insurance funds and unit trusts. The idea is that the intermediary can switch cheaply between companies to catch the best sectors. The Sib nearly outlawed broker funds in 1990 because of a potential conflict of interest for the intermediary, worries about investment performance and double charging - the investor pays the fund manager and the intermediary. Surely what matters in the end is investment performance? Yes, but high annual charges eat into a greater proportion of a fund's return. The table shows the performance of Knight Williams' largest fund, Global Income and Growth, with about Pounds 300m. Its performance is not out of line with the average broker life fund but it has been beaten by the FT-A World Index and the average unit and investment trust (apart from over one year, when KW beat the average unit trust). Over five years, a building society investment would have proved more profitable.

Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev speaks about the goals that the emerging comprehensive  European security system must focus on and how such a system can  be established.    [Kozyrev] There may be too many seemingly efficient "simple"  solutions. The bases for these proposals are mostly two factors  that are regarded as axioms of a modern European policy. First  of all, there is talk of a "security vacuum and gray zone" in  Central Europe, an area that will most probably become a region  of Russian expansion. It is also to be feared that "Russia will  embark on a nationalist-empire policy" following the recent  Russian parliamentary elections.    [PESTI HIRLAP] Should one fear the revival of Russian  imperialism?    [Kozyrev] One should not fear that Russian tanks might  advance toward the West, because a Russian "performance" of the  Yugoslav drama is much more plausible. Such a development would  have dire consequences, such as several million refugees,  large-scale industrial catastrophes, and the use of tactical  nuclear weapons.    [PESTI HIRLAP] In this case, what could NATO do to defend  its Eastern European partners?    [Kozyrev] A few Chernobyl-type catastrophes could destroy  all Europe, and the advanced positions could not save anyone.  This worst-case scenario could be caused precisely by a hasty  expansion of NATO, because this would strengthen the "threat  concept" of the Russian extremists. The strategy of "counting  on the worst" is also dangerous because it involves the  possibility of a self-fulfilling prophecy.    The fears of an "Eastern danger" could be mostly dissipated  if the European countries set up partnership relations with a  democratic Russia that is building a constitutional state and a  market economy. Russia has no territorial claims on any country  in the world, and its military doctrine is clearly defensive.    [PESTI HIRLAP] What is your opinion about the recent  parliamentary elections?    [Kozyrev] Fascism has no grounds in Russia. The voters did  not vote in favor of a "Western campaign" or the forced revival  of the Soviet Union and the socialist camp. They voted against  the personal ambitions and stubbornness of some reform  politicians and against misery and crime.    Several factors must be taken into consideration in  establishing a new Europe. The so-called shock diplomacy and the  policy of accepting events that have occurred should be excluded  from the political methods. Russia is in favor of broad  consultations among interested parties. Russia does not have  the right to tell NATO which country it should accept; at the  same time, however, Russia is justified in demanding that NATO  take into consideration the particularities of the naturally  extended interim period and, in the long term, it confirms the  basic principles in its documents, principles according to which  NATO is an open organization that offers free access to every  democratic country in Europe. There can be no "first- and  second-class security," or "special influence zones." Nor can  be "isolated regions" or any "cordon sanitaire."</p>

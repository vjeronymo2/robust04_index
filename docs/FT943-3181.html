			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Observer: Oxbridge Keele hauled The Keele connection continues its conquest of Whitehall, leaving products of the Oxbridge finishing school strewn in its wake. Keele University graduate Richard Mottram will take the top job in the Ministry of Defence when Sir Christopher France retires in March. Back in his old department, Mottram will have another Keele man as his deputy - Moray Stewart. And at the weekly meeting of permanent secretaries (the 'College of Cardinals') he will be in the company of John Vereker, the Keele graduate who is permanent secretary at the Overseas Defence Administration. Mottram, 48, was the star prosecution witness at the trial of Clive Ponting over leaked documents on the torpedoing of the Argentine cruiser, General Belgrano, during the Falklands war. As private secretary to the then defence minister, Michael Heseltine, Mottram gave evidence in camera on a top-secret document, known as the 'Crown Jewels', which dealt with the events leading up to the sinking. Mottram, permanent secretary at the Office of Public Service and Science for the past two years, has been looking after William Waldegrave's civil service reforms. Tipped for the top defence job for some years, he may yet be a candidate to succeed Oxford- educated Sir Robin Butler when the latter retires as cabinet secretary and head of the civil service in 1998.</p>

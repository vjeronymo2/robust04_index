			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Leading Article: The franc at bay THE BATTLE for the preservation of the parity of the French franc is not just a fight to preserve French monetary policy. Nor is it merely about the survival of an ERM without exchange controls. It is about the fate of the Franco-German relationship, the heart of the European Community. Fresh from having made large fortunes by speculating against the Italian lira and the pound sterling, investors are testing the French franc's parity to destruction. But the French and the Germans can defeat the speculation. They should use their powers without stint. French Finance Minister Michel Sapin has insisted that the attack on the franc is unwarranted by the fundamentals. He has received strong support for this view from the Bundesbank and the German finance minister, Mr Theo Waigel. If one ignores purely cyclical differences between Germany and France, the view is correct. Thus whether or not this parity can be held will show whether any fixed exchange rate regime, short of monetary union, can be preserved among larger European countries. The cyclical economic divergence is important, however, in explaining current pressure. Given the high level of unemployment in France, the unpopularity of the Socialist government and the tiny majority in favour of the Maastricht treaty, investors wonder whether the French authorities will be willing to pay the price that may be needed to preserve the parity. The announcement that German broad money grew at an annual rate of 9 per cent between the last quarter of 1991 and August 1992 further increased the doubts, since it suggests that any early easing of German monetary policy is unlikely. French tactics can be faulted. Mr Sapin may, for example, have made an important, if understandable, mistake when he suggested last week that a French interest rate cut was merely being postponed until after the referendum. Perhaps the French authorities should have raised interest rates sooner. Yesterday's 2 1/2 percentage point increase in the French emergency lending rate and the overnight rates of 30 per cent may also be insufficient. Yet tactics are not everything. What matters in the end is the determination to ensure that - cost what it may - those who buy the French franc will be enriched and those who speculate against it will be impoverished. The French can do most of what is needed for themselves. But at this critical juncture, they also need German help. The French have dedicated themselves, over almost a decade, to making their country 'Bundesbankable'. The Bundesbank should return the compliment. German rates of interest should, if necessary, be cut. Once the fingers of the speculators have been burned, they can be raised once more. This is not a choice which the Bundesbank will want to make, caught as it is between the goal of German monetary stability and that of sustaining the parity between the D-Mark and the French franc. But it should now treat European monetary stability as, to an extent, a Franco-German effort. If the Bundesbank does not show the needed flexibility, it will still rule the European monetary roost, but it is likely to do so in uncomfortable isolation.</p>

			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Lottery fails to win government support THE government put a national lottery firmly on the backburner yesterday by declining to back a bill even though it saw 'attractions' in the idea. It pledged to 'examine further' issues that a lottery would raise. Mr Peter Lloyd, a junior Home Office minister, said: 'We shall put that work in hand immediately and announce our conclusions as soon as possible.' Without government support, fewer than 100 MPs voted for the bill in a closure motion. The measure therefore stands only a slender chance of becoming law. Mr Ivan Lawrence, Conservative MP for Burton, who introduced the bill, said its aim was 'nothing less than to raise the quality of life in Britain to even higher levels'. He added that Albania was the only other European country not to have a lottery and reminded MPs that lottery money had paid for construction of the British Museum. Mr Terry Dicks, Conservative MP for Hayes and Harlington, said he would oppose the bill unless proposals to use some of the proceeds to support the arts were withdrawn. The Rev Ian Paisley, Democratic Unionist leader, said: 'We have enough gambling outlets without the government going into gambling sponsorship.' Ladbroke is offering 2-1 against a national lottery bill being passed in the lifetime of the next government.</p>

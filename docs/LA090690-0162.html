			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOLLYWOOD CORNER INFAMOUS FOR DECAY TO GET A MAKEOVER;  </P> <P> URBAN RENEWAL: CITY OFFICIALS UNVEIL PLAN FOR RETAIL AND RESIDENTIAL PROJECT.  IT WOULD REPLACE A CRIME-RIDDEN CLUSTER OF ABANDONED SHOPS.  </P> <P> A notoriously dangerous and crime-ridden corner of Hollywood could become a  gleaming model of redevelopment under a Cinderella-style transformation plan,  city officials said Wednesday.  </P> <P> The abandoned cluster of fast-food restaurants, strip mall stores and an  earthquake-damaged hotel -- which Los Angeles Councilman Michael Woo called a  snake pit -- stands decaying at the corner of Hollywood Boulevard and Western  Avenue.  </P> <P> "I can't think of any other corner in Hollywood that inspires this much dread  in people," Woo said at a news conference on the northeast corner of the  intersection, as city officials, neighborhood activists and an occasional  transient looked on.  </P> <P> Plans for the corner include 88,000 square feet of commercial and retail space,  including a supermarket and drugstore. Above the retail outlets, 190 units of  low-income housing for senior citizens are planned.  </P> <P> If all goes well, Woo said, the commercial half of the project should break  ground in late spring, with the housing to follow shortly after.  </P> <P> "This corner should be a gateway to the Los Feliz and Hollywood communities,"  Woo said. "If we can make this project a success, it will send out shock waves  to the rest of the city that redevelopment works."  </P> <P> The project would cost about $14 million and encompass 3.2 acres. It would be  developed by the private Hollywest Associates group, which owns the property,  with the help of $4.4 million in loans and financing from the city's Community  Redevelopment Agency.  </P> <P> The financing is critical to the project, because Hollywest has expressed  reservations about the high cost of financing the project and its location in  such a rundown area, said Woo and Donald Spivack, the CRA's director of  operations for Hollywood.  </P> <P> Development of the area is considered especially important because a Metro Rail  stop is planned for the southeast corner of Hollywood and Western, Woo said.  </P> <P> Area business people expressed guarded optimism. "We need redevelopment," said  Yit Chong, manager of the B &amp; B Burgers across Western. "It's too much like  a jungle here."  </P> <P> The project cleared its first hurdle Wednesday when it was approved by the CRA  Housing Committee. The CRA's board of commissioners is expected to give its  approval today. The City Council has the final say.  </P> <P> The CRA is touting the mixed-use project as a cornerstone of its $922-million  Hollywood redevelopment effort, and city officials say they expect the  project's financing to be approved without a hitch.  </P> <P> "We hope this will anchor the eastern end of Hollywood," Spivack said. "It will  stabilize the area and attract more private development."  </P> <P> City officials acknowledged they have their work cut out. As they spoke at the  site, a newly hired armed guard watched over the boarded-up buildings. Beside  him stood a fence erected to keep out drug dealers, prostitutes and the 132  transients who lived in the abandoned Rector Hotel on the corner until police  kicked them out two weeks ago.  </P> <P> Last year, there were four burglaries, seven thefts from cars, eight cars  stolen, 12 assaults with deadly weapons and 40 robberies at the site, according  to police statistics. Police said there have been eight burglaries so far this  year.  </P> <P> "It has had a history of problems," said Capt. Rick Dinse, commanding officer  of the Los Angeles Police Department's Hollywood Division.  </P> <P> Representatives of at least eight area neighborhood organizations are  supporting the project. Some, such as the Los Feliz Oaks Homeowners Assn., have  been behind it through the three years it has taken to inch the project through  the city bureaucracy.  </P> <P> Others, such as the Los Feliz Improvement Assn., got behind it only recently,  after developers cut the number of housing units in half.  </P> <P> "The crime is hideous," said Beth Jacobs of the Los Feliz Oaks group, which  says it represents 700 residents. "At one time, this used to be a busy business  and commercial district for the surrounding neighborhoods. But there is nothing  left."  </P></p>

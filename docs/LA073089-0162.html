			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> REPLICA OF DAVID  </P> <P> Re "David's New Resting Place" (Calendar, July 15): As an alumnus of California  State University, Fullerton, I was dismayed to see the replica of the statue of  David in his "final resting place."  </P> <P> The sight of David in pieces on the lawn offends my sense of classic art. Prof.  Don Lagerberg's opinion that the broken statue is an image that belongs to  everyone is a bit presumptuous. I, for one, do not identify with it except in a  negative way. I am appalled at the lack of respect shown to this great work of  art.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, with Mickey Mouse ideas like those expressed by Lagerberg, it is  no wonder that CSUF is frequently referred to as Cal State Disneyland.  </P> <P> GENE MICCO  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

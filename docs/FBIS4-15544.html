			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow April 11 TASS -- The Russian Foreign Ministry  released the following statement on Monday:    "According to the information the Russian Foreign Ministry  has at the moment, in the evening of April 10 NATO aviation,  which, according to U.N. Security Council decisions, was  exercising control in the no-fly zone in Bosnia-Herzegovina,  delivered bomb strikes on Bosnian Serbs' artillery positions  which shelled Gorazde and where, apart from civilians, U.N. and  international red cross workers were staying. The U.N.  secretary-general's envoy to the former Yugoslavia Yasushi  Akashi discussed with Butrus-Ghali the possibility of using  aviation to protect U.N. personnel in retaliation to artillery  shelling of safe havens, including Gorazde, as envisaged by U.N.  Security Council resolutions.    "These violations cannot be tolerated. However, neither one  must support provocations to which the Muslim side resorts, of  which U.N. officials have repeatedly reported. In its statement  of April 6, 1994 the U.N. Security Council demanded an end to  the provocation from either side.    "Unfortunately, Russia was informed about the decision to  use  aviation retrospectively. We expect full information from the  U.N. leadership about what happened.    "As a direct and active participant in the Bosnian  settlement  Russia stands for the prevention of escalation of this conflict  and for invigoration on the part of the international community  of efforts aimed at showing all sides the road to peace."</p>

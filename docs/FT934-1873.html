			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / International Company News: Finmeccanica plans fundraising Finmeccanica, the Italian state-controlled engineering group, is selling about 19 per cent of its quoted Ansaldo Trasporti subsidiary in a further attempt to raise cash and limit its stake in the company. The placing will cut Finmeccanica's holding to 67 per cent from more than 86 per cent. The group has been hit by the recession and plunging demand for the aerospace products of its Alenia subsidiary. In recent weeks, Finmeccanica has launched US initial public offerings for minority stakes in its Union Switch &amp; Signal and Elsag Bailey Process Automation subsidiaries. The latest deal is being managed by Paribas and Lehman Brothers. Finmeccanica formerly held about 60 per cent of Ansaldo Trasporti, but its share rose after an acquisition last year. First-half 1993 sales at Ansaldo Trasporti fell sharply to L318.7bn (Dollars 188m) from L407.5bn, while new orders dropped by more than half to L324.5bn. Finmeccanica's own first-half results showed a pre-tax loss of L159.9bn against net profits of L180.5bn in the same period in 1992. The group is expected to break even in the full year due to asset sales. Price Waterhouse, the international auditing and consulting group which is being sued by the new management of Italy's troubled Ferruzzi-Montedison group, has decided to join the legal action being taken against five ex-Montedision managers and the heirs of Mr Raul Gardini, the group's former head. Price Waterhouse alleges the individuals knowingly concealed 'fraudulent acts' and 'violated the obligations imposed on them by law' in relation to their auditors. The auditors are demanding compensation for damage caused and indemnification against any claims for compensation.</p>

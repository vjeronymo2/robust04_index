			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It is intended that the composition, relative weights and manner of calculation for both Indexes will remain constant. It is conceivable, however, that market developments may eventually necessitate changes in the weighting, composition or calculation methodology of an Index. Such developments could include, among other things, changing liquidity conditions or the discontinuation of existing contracts, the emergence of new contracts on relevant commodities, or major progress in substitution technology that renders obsolete industrial processes that make use of a certain commodity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Decisions relating to changes in index weighting, composition or calculation methodology will be determined on the basis of advice from a neutral business committee, the JPMCI Policy Committee. This committee is composed of senior employees in the commodities and research areas of J.P. Morgan as well as independent industry and academic experts. Commodity Group personnel of J.P. Morgan are restricted to an advisory, non-voting membership on the JPMCI Policy Committee. The issuer will immediately notify the Exchange and vendors of financial information that report the Index values in the event that there is a change in the relative weightings, calculation methodology or composition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Prices utilized in the Indexes will be based on New York Mercantile Exchange (``NYMEX'') prices for platinum and energy related commodities; Commodity Exchange (``Comex'') prices for other precious metals (Comex is a wholly-owned subsidiary of NYMEX); and London Metal Exchange (``LME'') prices for base metals. These prices are widely reported by vendors of financial information and the press. Index values will be calculated at least once each trading day by the issuer or an affiliate of the issuer and disseminated to vendors of financial information by the issuer. <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  Members of the JPMCI Policy Committee and employees of the calculation agent who are involved in the calculation of, or data collection for, any of the commodities underlying the notes or the aggregate value of the commodity index underlying the notes will be expressly prohibited from trading the notes. The calculation agent will adopt and maintain such reasonable and appropriate procedures as to ensure that the calculation agent, its agents, affiliates and employees, do not take advantage of or communicate to any other person any knowledge concerning changes in the value of the notes or commodities underlying the note before such information is made publicly available. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Amendment No. 1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Amex is able to obtain market surveillance information, including customer identity information, with respect to transactions occurring on the LME pursuant to its information sharing arrangements with the Securities and Futures Authority through the Intermarket Surveillance Group.

			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Campbell &amp; Armstrong cuts loss Campbell &amp; Armstrong, the shop and office fitting group, reported losses before tax of Pounds 294,000 for the nine months to end-December, a significant improvement on the Pounds 3.94m deficit for 1992-93. The company has changed its financial year end from March to December to balance the seasonal influences of activities over the two halves. Comparisons, therefore, are for the 12 months to March 31. Turnover for the nine months amounted to Pounds 38.9m (Pounds 50.6m). Losses per share came out at 1.7p (24.6p). No dividend is proposed, although the directors said they intended to seek the necessary approvals to eliminate the deficit on the profit and loss account by a reduction of the share premium account. The company last paid a dividend in 1992, when the distribution totalled 2p.</p>

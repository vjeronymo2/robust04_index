			<p>BFN     [Text] New York, May 18 (YONHAP) -- Kim Tae-chung, former  South Korean opposition leader, says the North Korean nuclear  row must be resolved while President Kim Il-song is still alive  because he is the only person in that country who can make a  major policy concession.    "There is no need to respond with cynicism to Kim Il-song's  recent peace gesture that included his express wish to visit the  United States," said Kim, chairman of the Seoul-based Peace  Foundation for the Asia and Pacific Region.    Speaking at a meeting sponsored by the Korea Society here  Wednesday, Kim Tae-chung predicted that if Kim Il-song could  tour the United States, he would become more "moderate."    The only way to settle the nuclear dispute is through the  establishment of diplomatic relations between Pyongyang and  Washington and American security guarantees for the communist  state, including suspension of the joint South Korea-U.S.  military exercise "Team Spirit," he said.    Earlier Wednesday, Kim met with South Korean correspondents  in New York and denied press reports that he had said it would  not be a problem even if North Korea possessed two or three  nuclear weapons.    Kim reportedly told the WASHINGTON TIMES that if North Korea  had two or three nuclear weapons, it wouldn't be much of a  problem considering that the United States has more than 20,000.    Kim's alleged remark, made in an interview with the times  and  picked up by the South Korean press, has had political  repercussions back home. Calling the report groundless, Kim  apparently wanted to clarify his statement.    "North Korea's possession of nuclear weapons is unacceptable  under any circumstances," he said. "If it already has, it  (Pyongyang) has to abandon it."    The United States should try and accommodate North Korea's  wish to establish diplomatic ties in order to resolve the  nuclear issue, Kim said. He recommended a package deal between  Washington and Pyongyang to solve all problems at once, as has  been proposed by North Korea.    Kim Tae-chung also denied he had proposed that former U.S.  President Jimmy Carter be sent to Pyongyang as a special envoy  of President Bill Clinton. He said he had only suggested that  an unofficial envoy be sent to Pyongyang but only after thorough  consultations with the Seoul government for the efficiency of  the sending.    In his Korea Society speech, Kim Tae-chung said "the use of  the China card" is crucial in resolving the nuclear row.    If North Korea refused to accept a proposal for a package  solution, China would face enormous international pressure to  join in UN Security Council sanctions against North Korea, he  said.</p>

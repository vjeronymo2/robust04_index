			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Texas' finding that the formation meets the Commission's oil and gas flow rate guidelines is based on pre-stimulation flow rates from the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 25&hyph;2 well and test results from the four PBU wells mentioned in (3) above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Our review shows that Texas' determination is based on permeability and flow rate data from wells that began producing from the Spraberry Formation between 1984 to 1992 although the Spraberry Formation has been produced for more than 30 years. Moreover, the five 1992 PBU data wells represent the initial capabilities of the least permeable lenses that ``remain to be produced'' in the Spraberry Formation. In addition, the ``near original'' initial pressures in two of these PBU wells show that the low permeabilities and flow rates are not the result of pressure depletion. However, Commission records show that reservoir pressures in the Merchant, Aldwell, and Texas&hyph;81 Midkiff Units had declined from between 2,000 and 2,200 psi to only 231 psi, 1,000 psi, and 1,050 psi, respectively, when unitized water injection commenced in the 1960's for the purpose of increasing pressure. Therefore, we find that the permeability and flow rate data in the record do not demonstrate that the formation meets the Commission's permeability and flow rate guidelines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In a previous tight formation proceeding, we found that the characteristics of a formation before the onset of sustained production from that formation should be evaluated to determine whether that formation meets the tight formation guidelines. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We have also held that current-day gas permeability and flow rate characteristics which are the result of years of sustained production do not demonstrate that a formation is a tight formation. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Accordingly, we find that the record lacks evidence showing that ``near original'' pressures are found throughout the recommended area and that the 1992 PBU tests do not sufficiently represent initial conditions found throughout the Spraberry Formation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See 63 FERC &para;61,067 (1993) at 61,291.

Therefore, even though the Spraberry may have exhibited little or no effective permeability to gas and no gas flow prior to the onset of sustained oil production (i.e., at initial conditions), our review shows that this is due to the fact that the pore spaces within Spraberry reservoirs were filled with oil and water. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Thus, we find that the record does not show that the Spraberry meets the Commission's definition of a tight formation (i.e., that the Spraberry is cemented together in a manner that greatly hinders the flow of gas through the rock). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Order No. 99, FERC Statutes &amp; Regulations, Regulations Preambles (1977&hyph;1981) &para;30,183 at p. 31,261.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Gas was dissolved in the oil at initial conditions, with a resulting effective permeability of zero.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> We note that the preliminary finding issued in the Texas&hyph;156 proceeding held that, at initial conditions, gas in such reservoirs is unable to flow because the pores of the rock are filled only with oil and water, not because of the way the rock is cemented together.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to concerns that the Spraberry appears to be the type of formation that does not meet the intent of the tight formation regulations, our review also shows that the record does not reflect the natural fracture permeability in the formation. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Commission's records show that the original permeability of the formation (prior to sustained production and pressure depletion) substantially exceeded 0.1 md due to the existence of interconnected, well-developed natural fractures that extend throughout the Spraberry Formation. The Commission's records also show that wells located parallel to the trend of the fractures have better reservoir permeability than those located perpendicular to the trend, but that natural fracture permeability is adversely effected by loss of reservoir pressure with sustained production. Although the PBU tests in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 25&hyph;2 well show a total permeability (matrix and fracture) of less than 0.1 md within the well's drainage area, the tested intervals produced high volumes of water during the tests, the reservoir pressure measured during the tests was at least 400&hyph;600 psi lower than original pressures found in the formation, and the record contains no evidence that any of the tested intervals was actually completed for production. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Therefore, it appears that the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 25&hyph;2 well's low permeability is the result of its location in an area of lower reservoir quality, and that the record does not contain sufficient evidence that the well's permeability reflects the formation's original permeability throughout the recommended area. We also find that oil and gas flow rate data from one well (the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 25&hyph;2) does not provide sufficient evidence to show that the formation meets the oil and gas flow rate guidelines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Interim Rule issued February 20, 1980, in Docket No. RM79&hyph;76, states that matrix permeability alone ``will not be sufficient to qualify a formation, because formations with very low matrix permeabilities may be economic to develop if fractures have developed naturally.

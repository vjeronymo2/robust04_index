			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Discrimination alleged by WPC DERBYSHIRE POLICE chief constable John Newing yesterday promised to review selection procedures for women detectives after a policewoman was awarded a four-figure sum in a settlement negotiated by Acas, the conciliation service, when she alleged sex discrimination against the force. Detective Constable Joy Court tried for five years to transfer to the force's criminal investigation department but was allegedly blocked an unofficial quota system that restricted the number of women detectives. DC Court, who has been an officer for 17 years, finally became a detective last July.</p>

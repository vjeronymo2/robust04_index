Francois Leotard  wished that those who give advice to think first, particularly  Abbe Pierre, to whom he said:    [Begin Leotard recording] Everybody understands that there  is  no military solution in Bosnia-Herzegovina. I have a lot of  respect for Abbe Pierre. I cannot recall him being closely  associated in recent months with any military decision that  should be taken regarding this matter. Once more, all those who  express themselves should think of not undermining either the  morale or the action of our soldiers on the ground. One should  be very careful. When we find ourselves in a crisis situation,  youngsters, officers, non-commissioned officers, and soldiers  are carrying out a difficult mission risking their lives. Every  word should be weighed. I am not sure this has been the case  during the last few weeks with civilians. We have to be very  careful. We are engaged in sensitive operations. Let's not  undermine either the morale or the missions our soldiers are  asked to carry out. [end recording]</p>

Vice  Unification Minister Song Yong-tae, examining the prospects for  inter-Korean relations in 1994, said, "A momentous turning point  will come about. The government will establish a new attitude  in its reunification policy." The following is the government's  reunification policy as disclosed by Vice Minister Song during  an interview with MUNHWA ILBO.    [Kim] What is the direction of the government's  reunification policy for the new year in order to resolve the  stalemate in inter-Korean relations?    [Song] A momentous turning point will come about this year  for the progress of inter-Korean relations. Therefore, our  reunification policy will establish new features both in  domestic policy and in the policy toward the North. Internally,  we will develop a picture of the reunified fatherland and induce  national consensus. The reunified fatherland will be a state  where freedom, human rights, and welfare are embodied and where  law and morality prevail. For this, the features of the  reunified state should be embodied within South Korea in the  first place. This is why our country's reform process must  succeed. Reform is a prerequisite for reunification.    In our policy toward the North, we will strive so that the  nuclear issue can be resolved and inter-Korean relations can  enter the stage of reconciliation and cooperation. We will do  our utmost so that the working delegates' contact for the  exchange of special envoys, which was suspended last year, may  be resumed as soon as possible.    [Kim] In connection with our policy on the North Korean  nuclear issue, the most controversial point was the policy of  linking the nuclear issue with economic cooperation. Will you  continue to maintain this policy?    [Song] Since the nuclear issue is directly connected with  our  nation's survival, the highest precedence should be given to  resolving it. As long as the nuclear issue remains unresolved,  practical progress in inter-Korean relations is improbable. It  was in this perspective that we linked the nuclear issue with  economic cooperation. Therefore, we will maintain this policy.  I think that our policy of linking the nuclear issue with  economic cooperation demonstrated to the international community  our determination to resolve the nuclear issue and contributed  to strengthening the international cooperation system.    [Kim] One of our main concerns this year is the issue of  exchanging special envoys. If the exchange of special envoys is  realized, what issues will be discussed there?    [Song] There are differences between the two sides over the  mission of the envoys exchanged. We think the special envoy  would be a messenger who would convey the will of the top  leaders of each side. The North side assigns the special envoy  the role of discussing the pending issues between the North and  the South, such as the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,  alleviation of tensions, the implementation of the North-South  Agreement, the great national unity, and the North-South summit  talks.    To narrow this difference, we will have to have working  contacts, but our position in exchanging special envoys is that  the highest precedence must be given to resolving the nuclear  issue. North Korea also mentioned the nuclear issue when it  proposed the exchange of special envoys. The North shares our  position in the sense that it put forth the issue of  denuclearization at the top of the agenda. On all accounts, the  main point in the agenda in the exchange of special envoys is to  bring a breakthrough in resolving the nuclear issue.    [Kim] North Korea-U.S. negotiations to find a solution to  the North Korea nuclear issue are currently underway. What is  your view?    [Song] Since negotiations are underway, it is not easy to  have concrete prospects at present. However, it is clear that  the two nations do not want a catastrophe to result if the  negotiations fail. I think that the possibility of resolving the  North Korean nuclear issue is greater than ever before.    [Kim] What is the part to be changed above all in the  government's policy on North Korea in the event that the North  Korea-U.S. negotiations are concluded successfully?    [Song] The expected result in the current negotiations would  be a complete return of North Korea to the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty and acceptance of inspection by the  International Atomic Energy Agency. However, our position is  that mutual inspections between the North and South should  follow. In the event that agreement is reached on the mutual  inspections and those inspections are carried out, our  government will allow businessmen to visit the North and will  initiate full-scale economic cooperation.    We will also pay attention to joint development of  resources,  including nuclear energy. This will not only result in the  exchange of manpower and materials between the North and the  South but also will effect unprecedented changes in overall  North-South relations.    In addition, in the event that North Korea accepts all of  the  ordinary and ad hoc inspections by the IAEA and responds to the  exchange of special envoys of the North and the South, the issue  of suspending the 1994 Team Spirit exercise will be decided  under our government's authority. The issue of turning the  Armistice Agreement into a peace agreement, which is closely  related to consolidation of peace on the Korean peninsula, is  clearly prescribed in the basic agreement. Therefore, we will  make efforts to resolve this issue with the initiative.    [Kim] What were the noteworthy changes, if any, in North  Korea's movement and attitude last year?    [Song] In the political field, North Korea has been  reinforcing Secretary Kim Chong-il's system. In view of the  fact that North Korea admitted the failure of the Third Economic  Plan, we estimate that the North Korean economy is in a serious  situation. In the social field, the phenomenon of deviation  [iltal] has persisted despite the authorities' control. Even  amid the difficult economic situation, North Korea pushed ahead  with the expansion of armaments.    We can say that its overall internal situation is getting  worse. However, it is true that North Korea is seeking a series  of changes in a bid to maintain existing systems. For example,  the Supreme People's Assembly held last December declared  agriculture-first, trade-first, and light industry-first policy.  Besides, North Korea is accelerating the overhaul of its  juridical system with a view to inducing foreign investment.    [Kim] You mentioned changes in North Korea. What is your  view  on the degree of such changes?    [Song] It is true that North Korea is changing. But it is  too  early to consider this as an essential change. I would like to  personally describe it as tactical change. However, we should  also remember that when such tactical change is accumulated,  this change will be linked to strategic change.    One of the examples is that North Korea entered the United  Nations together with South Korea. Up until its entrance to the  United Nations, North Korea claimed that simultaneous entry was  a policy for the perpetuation of division. Nevertheless, it  choose the simultaneous entry in order to maintain its system  after the international situation changed. In view of North  Korea's past logic, this can be considered a great change.    Likewise, North Korea will continue to seek changes  according  to what occurs at home and abroad for the survival of its own  system. I think the direction of changes North Korea is seeking  would be that of Chinese-style change. I presume that even if  North Korea pursues the Chinese model, it will take its own  characteristics into account and will push for a limited opening  at a lower speed than that of China.    [Kim] People repeatedly say that circumstances for  reunification have now changed. Will you point out which are  beneficial to reunification and which are not in recent  relations among neighboring countries?    [Song] The neighboring countries of the Korean peninsula  support the principle of resolving the reunification issue by  the concerned parties, North and South of Korea, as well as the  denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. The fact that our  neighboring countries want the denuclearization of the Korean  peninsula and durable peace are aspects beneficial to us,  because the basis of our reunification policy is to advance  toward reunification through the peaceful coexistence between  the North and the South. Therefore, North and South of Korea  should take advantage of this opportunity, and should gather  wisdom so that they can ultimately advance toward reunification  by consolidating durable peace and through peaceful coexistence.    Regarding the effort to consolidate peace on the Korean  peninsula, we are somewhat worried about the indication given by  some neighboring countries increasing their military power. The  movements of Japan and China belong to this category. I think we  should take precautions for the possibility of such movements  advancing to such a degree as to threaten stability and peace in  Northeast Asia.    [Kim] It is expected that Japan, which kept step with the  United States, will accelerate the speed of contacting North  Korea this year. People pointed out that we should also deal  with this.    [Song] We understand that the Japanese Government will  initiate a full-scale negotiation with North Korea for the  establishment of diplomatic relations only after the nuclear  problem is solved. The United States, Japan, and we are keeping  the step with one another under a close cooperative system. This  relationship will continue in the future, too.    The visits of Japanese businessmen to North Korea do not  necessary mean that they are going to start economic cooperation  with North Korea at once. Such visits are made in order to make  an advance survey of North Korea with the purpose of preparing  for compensation to be paid to North Korea by Japan after the  establishment of diplomatic relations.    [Kim] What are the tasks that should be pushed ahead by  North  and South Korea as short-range projects to prepare for  reunification?    [Song] The top priority task is the issue of separated  families. This issue stands above any political issue. The North  and South reached an agreement in 1992 on the visit of old  parents to their hometown. The work of establishing a meeting  site for separated families in Panmunjom and exchanging  home-visiting groups and letters should be pushed ahead without  any precondition. Two years have passed since the basic  agreement, which the North and the South pledged before 70  million fellow countrymen, was adopted. We should make efforts  so that the work of various joint committees is resumed at an  early date to implement the agreement.</p>

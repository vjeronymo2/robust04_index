			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DC-10 LANDS AS ENGINE BREAKS UP  </P> <P> A Northwest Airlines DC-10 en route from Los Angeles to Minneapolis on  Wednesday made an emergency landing in Denver after the jet's No. 2 engine  apparently began breaking up and the pilot shut it down, officials said.  </P> <P> Flight 308, carrying 256 people, landed at Stapleton International Airport  Wednesday about 6:30 p.m. without incident or injury, according to Richard  Boulware, a spokesman at the airport.  </P> <P> "They experienced a severe vibration from the No. 2 engine, (and) as a  precautionary measure, they elected to make an unscheduled landing in Denver,"  said Northwest spokesman Kevin Whalen from the Minneapolis area, where the  airline is based.  </P> <P> The No. 2 engine of a DC-10 also is the focus of an investigation into the  disaster of United Airlines Flight 232 last month. The flight from Denver was  over Iowa when the engine apparently disintegrated.  </P> <P> Boulware, who observed the damage to the aircraft after it landed Wednesday  night, said there were "multiple shrapnel-like holes in the outer cowling" of  the No. 2 engine, which on a DC-10 is mounted in the vertical stabilizer at the  tail of the aircraft. The other two engines are mounted under the wings.  </P> <P> "One of the holes was big enough I could have stuck my hand through," he said.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] During a joint news conference today with Alfred  Serreqi, his Albanian counterpart who is officially visiting  Greece, Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias said the resumption  of the Athens-Skopje dialogue depends on whether the well-known  prerequisites set by Greece are accepted.    Papoulias expressed reservations about the stabilizing role  that Skopje can play, a view supported by Serreqi.  Specifically, using the word "Macedonia," Serreqi described  Skopje as a factor of stability in the region. Papoulias  stressed: With its constitution, symbols, and unceasing  propaganda, Skopje is strengthening those circles that do not  want peace and stability in the region. He noted: If Skopje  does not accept Greece's conditions, the dialogue will be  suspended, as the prime minister has said. The Greek position  cannot be misinterpreted.    The Albanian foreign minister is visiting Athens within the  framework of political dialogue between the European Union [EU]  and Albania. During their meeting, Papoulias and Serreqi  discussed Albania's relations with the EU, its accession to  various programs, and support for its effort to democratize and  change institutions.    The two ministers also discussed the crisis in the former  Yugoslavia, especially the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  Serreqi said the Albanian Government supports NATO's decision  on air strikes against Bosnia-Herzegovina and added that Tirana  disagrees with dividing that country into three parts.    Asked of the Albanian Government's draft bill on education,  which is expected to include provisions for the teaching of the  Greek language, Serreqi said the provisions of international  treaties and the CSCE will be considered.</p>

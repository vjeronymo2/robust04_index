			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of letter from Ernesto Zedillo, presidential </F> candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, to Mexican  Interior Secretary Jorge Carpizo on 24 June; place not given;  from the "24 Hours" newscast; read by announcer]    [Text] Dr. Carpizo: Allow me to inform you of the deep  consternation the news of your resignation from the Interior  Secretariat has caused me.    I have the privilege of knowing about your record in the  university and as a public servant. You have always been  committed to the nation's best causes and to strengthening the  republic. We Mexicans see in you a distinguished attorney, a  man with absolute democratic convictions, and a citizen who has  always shown respect for the law while exhibiting the purest,  ethical values.    For this reason and because of the great services you render  the nation, I am allowing myself to tell you that it is  necessary that you remain in the Interior Secretariat and as  chairman of the General Council of the Federal Electoral  Commission.    Hoping that the country will continue to benefit from your  unbiased and patriotic cooperation, I take this opportunity to  express to you my affection and respect.    Signed: Ernesto Zedillo.</p>

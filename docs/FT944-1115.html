			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Railtrack sell-off faces court test The RMT transport union is to seek leave from the High Court for a judicial review of last month's government decision to privatise Railtrack, which maintains the railway track and signal infrastructure. The challenge follows the recent High Court success by 10 unions, including the RMT, in overturning the home secretary's attempt to change the forms of compensation to victims under the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board, and by this week's climbdown by Mr Michael Portillo, employment secretary, in accepting a House of Lords judgment that part-time workers should have most of the employment rights enjoyed by full-time workers. The union says that powers to privatise Railtrack do not exist in the 1993 legislation that covers the move of the railway industry out of public ownership, that the government 'deceived' parliament about the immediate future of Railtrack during the passage of the act, and that the government's proposals for Railtrack conflict with European Union directives. Mr Jimmy Knapp, the union's general secretary, said yesterday: 'Following intensive discussions with our legal advisers we have concluded the government may be acting outside its powers in privatising Railtrack. 'There are vital constitutional issues here which must be addressed. The government has a deplorable record of acting outside its powers and I am confident that, given the chance to argue our case, the court will again tell the government to think again.' The union said in a statement it expected its case would be held early in the new year. It added that the detailed grounds for the challenge were still being discussed with its solicitors but that the government was vulnerable. Warburg mandate, Page 17</p>

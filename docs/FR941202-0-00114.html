			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In order to receive full approval, the Oregon permitting authorities must make the following changes:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Upset/Bypass as a Defense to Criminal Liability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Oregon must demonstrate to EPA's satisfaction that ORS 468.959, which provides an affirmative defense to criminal liability for violations that result from an ``upset'' or a ``bypass,'' as those terms are defined in the Oregon statute, is consistent with 40 CFR 70.6(g). The affirmative defense under ORS 468.959 is broader than the affirmative defense under part 70 for emissions in excess of a technology-based emissions limitation caused by an ``emergency'' ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 40 CFR 70.6(g)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Small Business Assistance Program Provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Oregon must demonstrate to EPA's satisfaction that ORS 468A.330(4)(a) is consistent with the enforcement responsibilities of 40 CFR 70.11(a) and the SBA Enforcement Guidance. ORS 468A.330(4)(a) does not simply give a source an opportunity to correct a violation observed during a technical assistance visit before being subject to enforcement action, but rather protects the source from follow-up inspections or enforcement activities that ``result from'' observations made during a technical assistance visit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result of today's final interim approval of Oregon's part 70 programs, the requirement to submit a permit application to ODEQ or to LRAPA applies to all part 70 sources, as defined in the approved program within the State, except for any source of air pollution over which a federally recognized Indian Tribe has jurisdiction.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 59 FR 55813, 55815&hyph;55818 (November 9, 1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This interim approval, which may not be renewed, extends until January 2, 1997. During this interim approval period, the State is protected from sanctions, and EPA is not obligated to promulgate, administer and enforce a Federal operating permits program in the State. Permits issued under a program with interim approval have full standing with respect to part 70, and the 1-year time period for submittal of permit applications by subject sources begins upon the effective date of this interim approval, as does the 3-year time period for processing the initial permit applications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the State fails to submit a complete corrective program for full approval by July 2, 1996, EPA will start an 18-month clock for mandatory sanctions. If the State then fails to submit a corrective program that EPA finds complete before the expiration of that 18-month period, EPA will be required to apply one of the sanctions in section 179(b) of the Act, which will remain in effect until EPA determines that the State has corrected the deficiency by submitting a complete corrective program. Moreover, if the Administrator finds a lack of good faith on the part of the State, both sanctions under section 179(b) will apply after the expiration of the 18-month period until the Administrator determined that the State had come into compliance. In any case, if, six months after application of the first sanction, the State still has not submitted a corrective program that EPA has found complete, a second sanction will be required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

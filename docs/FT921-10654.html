			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Coca-Cola Amatil advances 8% COCA-COLA Amatil, Australia's largest soft drink and snack food group, has lent weight to the recession-proof reputation of its operations with a solid sales and earnings performance for 1991. The company yesterday announced an 8.2 per cent rise in net profits to ADollars 68.9m (USDollars 51.8m) for the year to December against ADollars 63.7m a year earlier. Sales advanced 16.6 per cent to ADollars 1.79bn from ADollars 1.54bn. The annual dividend is up to 15.5 cents a share from 14.5 cents. Coca-Cola Amatil, which dominates Coke bottling and distribution in the Pacific Basin, completed a divestment programme during the year to limit its operations to the core businesses of beverages and snack food. The biggest divestment was the company's packaging division which helped reduce net interest payments from ADollars 92.9m to ADollars 82.3m. Depreciation charges also dropped from ADollars 58.7m to ADollars 54.0 m. The directors said one of the keys to the company's performance, despite depressed economic conditions, had been the eighth consecutive annual market share gain for the Coke brand. Coke-trademarked brands lifted their market share by 0.5 per cent to a record 48.9 per cent in an industry where 1 percentage point means ADollars 30m in revenue. 'The beverages operation recorded strong growth in sales and significant increases in trading profits, as a result of the combined effects of organic growth and acquisitions,' the company said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "(km)": "HTT, the Manufacturer of Tamara, Is </F> Developing a More Advanced Passive Radar"]    [Text] Prague--Tesla Pardubice HTT, manufacturer of the  Tamara passive radar, which, according to experts, can reveal  even the "invisible" U.S. Stealth reconnaissance aircraft, is  developing a more advanced new-generation passive radar. This  information has been confirmed by Chief of the General Staff  Major General Jiri Nekvasil.    Representatives from the Pardubice-based enterprise,  however,  do not want to divulge anything about this new system, which  should be called Borap. "We will not discuss the things under  research; they are taboo," declared Rudolf Barak, president of  the HTT Group company. Nevertheless, he indicated that special  enhancements to the current Tamara system are involved.    Tamara can reveal aircraft against which current radar  systems are ineffective. It is similar to the U.S. AWACS early  warning system. However, as opposed to active radar systems,  which emit radio waves and assess their reflection, Tamara only  receives radio impulses from the atmosphere.    So far, the Army has refused to purchase more Tamara systems  for its arsenal because it is waiting for the completion of the  more advanced system. The Defense Ministry currently has at its  disposal one Tamara radar and two of its antecedents, the Ramona  system.</p>

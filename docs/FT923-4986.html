			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / International Company News: CRA declines 6.8% after ADollars 32m charge CRA, the Australian mining group 49 per cent owned by RTZ of the UK, yesterday said equity accounted net profit fell by 6.8 per cent to ADollars 128m (USDollars 91.4m) in the first half to the end of June, on turnover up 9.2 per cent to ADollars 2.5bn. However, CRA said net profit would have increased by 16.2 per cent but for a ADollars 32m charge against earnings required to correct a reduction in the surplus on the staff superannuation fund. The group also revealed the Australian Securities Commission has queried the accounting treatment of several asset write-downs included in a ADollars 384m extraordinary loss in the year to the end of December. The treatment of the write-downs as extraordinary rather than abnormal items allowed the group to declare a net profit for last year of ADollars 350m, rather than a net loss of ADollars 34m. The group said it was too soon to say whether the 1991 accounts would have to be restated. The board declared a fully franked interim dividend of 15 cents a share, against 10 cents the previous year. The shares closed 40 cents lower at ADollars 12.24.</p>

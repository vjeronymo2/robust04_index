			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Thailand wants quality, not quantity, from rice crop - The favoured strategy for contending with fiercer competition in the export market The Thai authorities want farmers to upgrade to higher qualities of rice as part of a long-term restructuring of the industry that is partly designed to counter the competitive threat from Vietnam's surging rice exports. The plan is for Thailand - easily the world's largest rice exporter with 30 per cent of all trade - to forego some production in favour of superior fragrant rice, which is in great demand on the open market. Although two-thirds of Thai rice production is already of the high quality category the government hopes that hardier traditional varieties, which require less fertiliser than high-yield strains, will flourish even during the country's increasingly debilitating water shortages. 'We can't compete with Vietnam with low quality rice. Yet many many foreigners know that fragrant rice comes from Thailand so it's right for us to do what we do best,' says Mrs Anchalee Ooraikul, director of policy and planning at the Ministry of Agriculture and Co-operatives. She admits that in laissez-faire Thailand it remains to be seen whether farmers can be persuaded to change. 'We do not have any concrete means of making the change,' she explains. 'We can only advise - the farmers, the private sector, can do what they want.' Nevertheless the government's target is to more than double the area planted with fragrant rice to a quarter of the total rice-growing area of 24m acres by 1999. Although the domestic demand from fragrant rice alone outstrips supply it does not yet command the premium to offset its lower yield; if high-grade paddy fetches Bt3,500 (Pounds 140) a tonne then fragrant rice will sell for Bt5,000. The yield from fragrant rice in the fertile central plain is typically 400kg per rai (1,600 square metres) - only half that of high yield rice. To raise farmers' income from premium grades the agriculture ministry is attempting to raise prices and customer recognition by promoting branded fragrant rice. This has been a good year so far for Thai farmers who are highly efficient at squeezing high yields of quality rice from the family land, but are still a prey to the vagaries of the world market. They produced three years of abundant crops before this last harvest, yet exports fell by 20 per cent and prices slumped to below USDollars 200 a tonne because of global oversupply. The drought caused this year's main crop to be 10 per cent down at 16.483 million tonnes; the second crop due to be harvested in a couple of months may be higher than anticipated at 2m tonnes because of recent rain. Many farmers were in desperate straits until Japan took the almost unprecedented step last year of importing rice to compensate for a poor harvest. Japan has imported more than 660,000 tonnes of Thai rice and more importantly caused prices in the wholesale market for 100%-B rice to nearly double from its dire May lows to USDollars 400 a tonne by the end of the year. The price has slipped this year to about Dollars 330. The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation expects Thailand to increase exports this year from 4.8m tonnes ago to 5m tonnes because of the price increase. Yet because Japanese consumers shun long-grained rice like Thailand's 'Indica' Japan's appetite for Thai rice is limited by the demand from processed food manufacturers like the makers of rice crackers. China, by contrast, recently sold Japan a further 300,000 tonnes of 'Manchurian' rice which suits the Japanese palate and makes China well placed to sell more than the total of 900,000 tonnes it has sold to Japan in last 12 months. Vietnam's abandonment of co-operative farming in 1988 led not only to sharp rises in production (last season's crop was a record 25m tonnes) and exports (from just 150,000 tonnes to 1.7m in seven years) but also to a gradual move up to higher qualities, with substantial quantities of 15% and 10% grades now being offered. (The percentages refer to the amount of broken rice, so the lower the figure the better, except that 100% is the highest quality). Once result is that Vietnam's has usurped Thailand as the dominant supplier to South America where middle-grade rice is popular. 'Vietnam is very, very strong competition. I think Thailand, Burma and Pakistan are very worried,' says Mr Siripol Yodmeungcharoen, the director of Thailand's internal trade department, who recently inspected Vietnam's rice industry. Vietnam can hardly hope to see rice production boosted much further and the country has problems with its state-controlled purchasing network which may have caused exports to slip 6 per cent last year, yet while costs are picking up they remain modest enough to give the country a significant advantage. As part of a Thai agriculture ministry's campaign to stop rice cultivation on marginal, arid or saline land farmers in the 22 provinces of the Chao Praya basin have been urged to grow soya or mung beans instead of the minor second rice crop. This harvest of high-yield rice, which was heavily-promoted by post-war governments, is now seen as an illogical use of treasured water and costly fertiliser. Preliminary data suggests that 1.1m acres have been given over to this year's second crop compared with 1.62m a year ago. Officials admit, however, that this may be due as much to the severe water shortage as much to government advice. One Bangkok-based rice trader says that simply removing the second crop's 2m tonnes from the global market of about 14m tonnes could boost prices of high grade rice. Thai officials say a lack of enthusiasm among exporters has hitherto killed any proposals to try to influence the trend of international prices. Rationalising rice growing in Thailand is a delicate process as more than half the population still work at least part of the year harvesting and planting rice in cycles that are deeply embedded in the national psyche. Ultimately the government is likely to have to offer effective intervention programmes to persuade farmers who have grown rice for generations to switch to new, and from the farmer's viewpoint riskier, crops. Ironically this year's unexpectedly high-prices may have delayed the re-adjustment process. 'We've been trying to tell the farmers not to make too much of this year's high price - if the drought gets worse or the world market moves against us we'll very quickly have another crisis,' says Mrs Anchalee.</p>

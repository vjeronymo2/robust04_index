			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / International Company News: Dutch bank agrees Polish deal ING Bank of the Netherlands yesterday signed a letter of intent with the Polish government under which it promises to buy a 25.9 per cent stake in the Bank Slaski, the second of the country's state-owned banks to be privatised. The 2.4m shares are priced at 500,000 zlotys (USDollars 24.20) each, making the investment worth around Dollars 58m when the agreement is signed early next month. The deal is the first acquisition by a western commercial bank of a significant share in an eastern European bank. It is also one of the largest foreign investment projects in Poland to date. Mr Gerrit Tammes, the vice-chairman of the group's banking arm, said that the purchase meant technical assistance for the Bank Slaski, while ING would be acquiring 'knowledge of the market'. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is soon due to approve a Dollars 165m financial package for Fiat Auto Poland, the Italian carmaker's subsidiary in Bielsko Biala which makes the Cinquecento and Fiat 126 models. The package is to consist of a Dollars 40m equity stake, which would amount to around 10 per cent of the company's share capital, and Dollars 120m in loans - part of which would come direct from the EBRD and the remainder syndicated by the bank. Fiat is due to produce around 250,000 vehicles at Bielsko this year and plans to start assembly of the Uno model there next year.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wing Kay Po] </F>   [Text] Legislators last night abandoned party rivalries to  register an unprecedented vote of no confidence in the British  and Chinese governments. In a rare show of unity, the Liberal  Party gave its backing to a motion initiated by the United  Democrats leader, Martin Lee, attacking the current and incoming  sovereign powers for violating the Joint Declaration -- the  agreement under which Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule in 1997.  Lee's motion was passed without opposition -- by 23 votes, but  three government officials and a maverick legislator, Chim  Pui-chung, abstained. Other members were absent.    Lee accused China of interfering in Hong Kong affairs ahead  of 1997 and said Britain was "joining hands" with China in  violating the Joint Declaration, signed in 1984. The leader of  the Liberal Party, Allen Lee, said he did not believe Britain  and China "deliberately went back on their word" to uphold the  Joint Declaration, but he charged them with abandoning their  promises to co-operate to achieve a smooth transition.    Martin Lee said the motion amounted to a vote of no  confidence in the two powers. "My motion is effectively a vote  of no confidence aimed at both Britain and China," Lee said  outside the chamber. "It shows a profound concern among  legislative councillors that Britain and China will not adhere  to their obligations under the Joint Declaration."    During the debate his colleague, Szeto Wah, said: "We have  reason to believe that the British and Chinese sides have ganged  up to destroy the spirit of the Joint Declaration. We are being  betrayed." Martin Lee said the Joint Declaration seems to have  become "a declaration of joint destruction". He listed 10  "incidents of violations of the Joint Declaration". Among them  were the seven diplomatic letters exchanged between Britain and  China in 1990 which showed a joint attempt to slow democratic  development. He also quoted a secret Sino-British agreement on  the composition of the Court of Final Appeal as an example of  Britain's complicity in violating the Joint Declaration.    Martin Lee said the Basic Law, announced in 1990, violated  the Joint Declaration, without protest from Britain. "If we  don't defend the spirit of the Joint Declaration, Hong Kong will  be ruled by a puppet regime from the north," Martin Lee said.    Christine Loh, an independent legislator, said Britain  seemed  resigned to letting China "re-interpret and redefine" the Joint  Declaration. "Britain seems to take the view that it will have  vacated Hong Kong by 1997, so that whatever happens here is not  Britain's responsibility," she said.    The Secretary for Constitutional Affairs, Nicholas Ng, said  it was "plainly untrue" that the Hong Kong-British government  had failed to abide by the objectives of the Joint Declaration.  Ng rejected criticisms that the government betrayed the  aspirations of Hong Kong people for a legislature of more  directly-elected seats.    "As a responsible government we have to strike the right  balance between the expressed desire of the community for a  greater say in running their own affairs on the one hand, and a  form of government capable of transcending 1997. I believe  we've struck the right balance," he said. Ng also defended the  secret Sino-British agreement on the Court of Final Appeal.</p>

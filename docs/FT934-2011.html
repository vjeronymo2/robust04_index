			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / The GATT Deal: Europe and China stand to gain most - Winners and Losers THE WORLD: Estimates of the boost to the world economy from tariff-cutting on goods range from Dollars 212bn-Dollars 270bn a year at the end of 10 years. These figures underestimate the likely total gain because they do not include benefits from services trade liberalisation, stronger trade rules and greater business confidence. A World Bank/OECD study says 90 per cent of the benefit of Dollars 213bn a year comes from farm trade reform, with the rest reflecting tariff cuts on industrial goods. OECD countries reap two-thirds of the benefit from trade liberalisation in goods and almost all the gains from liberalisation of services. Most countries - rich and poor - will gain on balance but some, notably poor food importers, will be worse off. Consumers and efficient producers will benefit around the world but sectors losing trade protection, especially farmers in rich countries, will lose. Fairer trading rules and better market access will help countries in the process of economic reform, whether developing or former communist nations, which have liberalised their trade regimes to stimulate export-led growth. THE WINNERS: The European Union is by far the biggest winner from the round (gaining Dollars 80bn a year on World Bank/OECD figures). This is mostly due to farm trade reform which will reduce farm subsidies and, by cutting food prices, boost consumers' incomes. As the world's biggest exporter, the EU will also benefit from more open markets for its goods and services. The seven members of the European Free Trade Association also do well. They now subsidise their farmers even more generously than the EU and are big exporters of industrial goods and services. China is the second largest winner, mainly from textiles liberalisation. Though China is not yet a Gatt member, it is a member of the restrictive Multi-Fibre Arrangement which will be phased out over 10 years. Other east Asian economies will benefit from better market access for their exports. Japan and the US gain from market-opening abroad and farm trade reform at home, especially - for Japan - the opening of its rice market. The 14-strong Cairns Group of agricultural exporters win big benefits from better access to world markets for their efficient farmers. THE LOSERS: 'Unequivocal losers,' at least in the short term, are poor net food importers who will have to pay higher prices for food in world markets as US and EU export subsidies are cut, and countries receiving trade preferences in industrialised-country markets, the value of which will fall as tariffs are lowered. These countries include virtually all of Africa. Indonesia is also a big loser as are Caribbean nations whose relatively high-cost exports of textiles and bananas now benefit from preferences in the US and EU. In the longer term, these countries, too, should gain from the Round - first and foremost from better trading rules that protect the interests of small nations against bullying by the giants, second because higher food prices are likely to lift farmers' incomes and eventual food production, and third because they should benefit from a rise in world prosperity.</p>

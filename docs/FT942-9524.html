			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Private View: A chairman's moonlight sonatas Amateur pianists may gnash their teeth in envy at the Yorkshire accountant who, while head of a large British engineering company, played the Grieg concerto with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra at London's Festival Hall. They should take comfort instead. For, says Sir Trevor Holdsworth - he is now chairman of National Power - business is a lot less difficult and frightening than preparing and performing a concerto. When at home in Chelsea, Sir Trevor practises on his 'A' model Steinway for at least half an hour before breakfast, and leaves for work at 8.30. 'Pianistic jogging,' he calls it - a fixed routine of scales and arpeggios to flex the fingers, wrists and arms. I asked him if the secret was knowing how to practise. 'Yes, it's discipline. As people get older they say: 'Now I've got time, I'm going to take up the piano.' There's no way they're ever going to be able to do it. You realise how much is built in by instinct; and the discipline you need, you've got over as a child when it was still interesting. Trying to do that intellectually at 60 must be almost impossible.' Why did you keep going? 'You can't escape it.' Did you think of it as an investment for your old age? 'Er . . . yes. In the sense that it was a lovely interest to have outside business. Also you don't actually get worse as you get older whereas in practically everything else, you do. I've probably still got a musical handicap of minus four where my golfing friends are struggling.' Far from deteriorating, pianists usually improve with age: like the late Artur Rubinstein whom Sir Trevor used to meet regularly in the 1970s when they both stayed at the Savoy. 'Rubinstein was inclined to be mischievous and say you shouldn't practise for more than two hours - it's a waste of time.' Apart from the Grieg, Sir Trevor has performed the Schumann concerto (also in A minor), Mozart's K453 in G, K488 in A and K595 in B flat, and given recitals of Chopin, Debussy and others. He was as modest as only a serious amateur can be: laconic, discreet, reflective and good-humoured. But his sentences tended to die uncompleted and sometimes he knocked on the table while talking as if to drum up thoughts. In Who's Who his recreations are simply described as 'music, theatre'. He started to play at the age of five and was forced by the grammar school to drop his favourite subject, science, because he wanted to take music in the sixth form. Why did he not make a career of it? 'I think actually I was very good at theory, at harmony, counterpoint, figured bass - lovely] - which is pure learning, and yet probably fell short of the final perfection, which is pure sound, which is instinctive.' You are not the complete musician? 'Well, I might fall short because . . . it is too intellectual. Yes. I can memorise, by rules rather than by sound. I always slightly worry when I play in public. I know it absolutely perfectly. I could write it out. I could tell you the whole harmonic structure, which I feel sometimes is not quite . . .' He left the suggestion hanging. Unlike the musical children of the suburban middle classes, young Trevor was not pushed. His father was a bookie. Sir Trevor called it turf accountant. 'My parents were very Yorkshire, very down to earth,' he said. 'They didn't think it was a career for a boy at all. As soon as it started getting serious they thought 'mmm . . .' They were probably right, actually. If there is any doubt, then you shouldn't be a musician. I think they felt there was a doubt.' And you suspected yourself you would never reach the top? 'Yeah. I didn't find myself being very upset when the answer was no.' Let me imagine the scene, I said: Bradford boy . . .practising secretly at night . . . ('No, no,' he laughed) . . . father comes up with a strap . . . says 'Get off that bloody piano ('Yes, yes') before I give you a right thrashing'. 'No, no. They were very proud of me really. I was turned out to play and they bought a small grand for me.' His real mother died suddenly when he was only eight and he was brought up by a stepmother, intelligent and determined, but not interested in the arts. Did he think his ability came from his mother? 'My real mother? Yes, I do. Because I just sense she obviously liked singing, very much - not too serious, sort of Gilbert and Sullivan level, but very keen. Yes, I can remember that.' I thought I heard an echo of this later when I asked Sir Trevor who his favourite pianists were. He named Ashkenazy, Brendel, Horowitz (especially playing Scarlatti), then added: 'The piano's quite difficult. I almost think the voice and violin are more musical. I can be moved by them more easily. Maybe when you're listening to a piano you're always thinking about how it's done.' Did you keep going in memory of her? 'No, not consciously. But I often think that if she'd been around she probably would have been much more encouraging.' You don't feel thwarted? 'I don't actually.' He almost whispered. 'No, not really. I got involved with the other things so much it became a marvellous hobby and I kept it going wherever I was, whatever I was doing.' So after school, and the war still on, Trevor Holdsworth joined Rawlinson, Greaves &amp; Mitchell, chartered accountants. A two-year interlude with the British Forces Network as a 'staff pianist' broadened his taste to encompass jazz and light music. Later, he wrote popular music for television. He spent 10 years with Bowater, the paper makers, then 25 with GKN, turning a fading manufacturer of nuts and bolts into a motor supplier with a world dominance in front-wheel drives. He became president of the Confederation of British Industry. He is director or chairman of three small companies, one medium-sized (Allied Colloids, makers of water-absorbent polymers) and two large: National Power and the Prudential. His wife, Patricia Ridler, connived at his double life: she was a repertory actress who played the violin. She died last year, also suddenly, of septicaemia and Sir Trevor has taken up her place on the board of the National Youth Theatre. There are three sons, all in business. What, I asked, are the rewards of playing the piano? 'That you can have a parallel interest.' But stamp-collecting is a parallel interest. 'Music is the ultimate, I think . . . pure sound. It's far deeper and got an emotional involvement as well. It's got everything.' Are you an emotional type? 'Yes, I think so. Really, quite.' Then, sotto voce: 'I suppose it's controlled. Yes. Yes.' You've spent all your life with businessmen. Are they stunted in this department? 'Well, I find a lot of them are really quite interested in it . . .' But his tone suggested otherwise. Do you feel different? 'Not consciously, no.' He whistled as if thinking whether to change his mind, but didn't. Do you find business creative? 'Yes I do, actually. I regard it as very creative when you get it right. Marvellously creative.' Does the piano teach you useful things? He toyed with the idea, then said: 'I've always been very good in business on concepts and strategy and that sort of thinking. Whether that is a sort of sonata form . . . Good music is all about starting with something and developing it, in a satisfactory form. There might be some spin-off between the two there. Probably is.' Or perhaps you are a hard-headed businessman who approaches music the same way, which is why you never became a professional? 'That would be a description hard to pin on me. I get it right, perhaps, more often than I get it wrong, but not from being hard-headed.' People call you laid-back. What does that mean? 'Well, that I don't appear to be hard-headed and thrusting. Actually, there's a sort of illusion about business, that it's all action-oriented. There's a feeling you should be rushing around, taking decisions, bang-bang. That's a mistaken impression.' Sir Trevor refuses business breakfasts. Had he stuck to that rule? 'I've hardly broken it, ever. I gave up City lunches as well for a time.' Perhaps this is the musical connection - that your attitude to business is more reflective? 'Yes. It is, actually. Probably.' It's the music that matters, not the notes? 'I'm much more interested in the objective. Then you can fill in the piece. Until I talked to you today I hadn't actually tried to formalise it.' Have you discovered useful things about yourself at the keyboard? He whistled and pondered. 'The one thing that I've found . . . that when I'm doing it I'm not thinking about anything else. That's the one thing that's all-absorbing. Yes. When I'm building up to a concert, I work very hard. I'm always very nervous. And yet, appearing in public for other things . . . the CBI for two years . . . I'm totally in control. 'I still want . . . ' He knocked at the table. 'Yes, I still like a challenge. I'd like to be able to do it a little easier. Yes, it's that competitive spirit again.' Are you going to say that running a business is a piece of cake by comparison with working up a concerto? 'Yeah, it is. After all, we get away with murder, don't we? I mean you're not on test every time. In business you get away with being very slack, or sloppy. You're not being tested every day, are you?'</p>

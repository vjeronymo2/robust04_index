			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Shell and Exxon units face setback in Norway NORWAY'S Industry and Energy Ministry has rejected applications for new oil and gas exploration offshore acreage submitted by the Norwegian subsidiaries of Royal Dutch/Shell and Exxon Corporation, according to leaked reports. Mr Finn Kristensen, industry and energy minister, is due tomorrow to announce the award of 50 blocks of new acreage offered under Norway's 14th licensing round. Both companies said yesterday they had submitted 'selective' applications based on their respective technical and profitability assessments of the blocks on offer. Neither Shell or Esso, Exxon's Norwegian subsidiary, said they had demanded 'special' conditions or treatment of their applications. Mr Einar Knudsen, director of information at Norske Shell, said the company had told energy officials that its return on investment for exploration drilling had to increase. Mr Per Schoeyen, public affairs manager of Esso, said if his company failed to win any fresh exploration acreage it would not be seen as 'dramatic'. Both Norske Shell and Esso have criticised Oslo's tough fiscal and licensing regimes. Other foreign oil companies have said that Norway, which faces tough competition from emerging oil and gas producers, should provide incentives for maintaining foreign investment. 'It takes longer for opportunities in new areas to materialise and I think Norway is exploiting this opportunity to drive a hard bargain while it can,' one industry official said yes-terday. Norway's ruling Labour party, facing a general election next month, got a boost from a poll yesterday showing that Norwegians backed its controversial decision to seek membership of the European Community, Reuter reports from Oslo.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Defense Ministry in Bonn wants to ease the  strict German arms control restrictions. A Defense Ministry  strategy document envisages the founding of a European agency to  make future decisions on all arms exports.    Correspondent C. Meincke: The detour via Europe is  intended to open up new sales markets for German arms products.  The confidential Defense Ministry strategy document for the  planned European arms agency says that the project would only  make sense if national restrictions were lifted. However, this  would also involve an amendment to the Maastricht Treaty, which  lays down that production of and trade in war materials are  governed by national laws. Thus, in future the agency alone  should make decisions on arms deals. This would mean for  example that the loose French restrictions could also be applied  to Germany.    Since the military strategists are aware of the reluctance  of  the British to enter into such close cooperation, they want to  find a small club of determined partners, which will include  above all France. The Defense Ministry predicts that trade  being carried out through the arms agency would cost many jobs.  This price would however have to be paid, since in free  competition, the highly efficient German arms industry as a  whole would probably emerge as a net profit-maker.</p>

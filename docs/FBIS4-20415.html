			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Xu beiying (1776 5563 4481): "Automation in </F> China's Financial Circles Rapidly Develops"]    [Text] After making strenuous efforts for more than a  decade, China has scored remarkable results in developing  automation in its financial circles. The infrastructural  facilities for automation in the financial circles have been  increase in number. Right now, more than 150 sets of large- and  medium-sized computers, over all 5,000 small- and  super-microcomputers, nearly 70,000 sets of multi-user and  single-user microcomputers, over 1,500 sets of computer-aided  peripheral equipment have been installed for the use by various  departments in China's financial circles.    With the rapid development of China's economy, the status  and  role of the financial circles have become more and more  important, and there is higher demand for modernization. One of  the important aspects is the use of electronic equipment. The  strategic plan for to achieve automation in China's financial  circles is as follows: preparations should be made during the  Sixth Five-Year Plan, and the foundation laid during the Seventh  Five-Year Plan. The scale for automation should be expanded  during the Eighth Five-Year Plan, while the process of  automation be completed during the Ninth Five-Year Plan. On the  basis of this plan, China's financial circles have done a great  deal of work. In addition to modernizing the equipment, a  telecommunications network is gradually being built. The  People's Bank of China is responsible to build the  special-purpose satellite telecommunications network. It has  already completed a main satellite earth station and 138 urban  ground stations. In 1992 alone, the inter-bank system had used  this network to handle more than 1.1 million transactions,  totaling almost 1.2 trillion yuan.    Remarkable achievements have also been made in the  development of software for automation in the financial circles.  A large number of software packages have been developed and used  for the nationwide electronic inter-banking system, the  city-wide system for check and fund clearing, the system for  accounting transactions, the system for handling saving  accounts, the city-wide interbank system for automatic deposits  and withdrawal, the nationwide inter-bank system for  reconciliation of statements of account, the system for handling  various statements and reports and the interbank ATM processing  system.    As a component part of China's modern payment system, the  nationwide automation system for offering stock price quotations  is under construction. The center and all its branches of the  system will be a part of the special-purpose satellite  telecommunications network of the financial circles to  automatically offer stock quotations and deliveries and handle  account clearances on the stock market.    In addition, modern automated service centers in the  financial circles are being added. The number of such automated  service centers has reached 25,000, accounting for more than 20  percent of the total number of service centers. Meanwhile, the  number of credit cards issued by various banks has exceeded  three million. Interbank ATM automatic deposits and withdrawal  services are available in scores of cities. Various banks have  also handled payroll and savings accounts on behalf of various  government organizations and enterprises, collect utility bills  and work as a part of the POS system [point of sales system].    China's automation system in the financial circles has  already yielded tremendous social and economic results,  accelerated the circulation of funds, helped the central bank  strengthen its macro-control and improved the services of the  banking industry. Within the ten years from the present moment  to the beginning of the 21st Century, China will establish an  up-to-date magnificent system of payments. In the next three  years, it is necessary to complete the nationwide main network  of satellite telecommunications, the regional networks  connecting all the major cities in the economically developed  areas along the Chang Jiang River and the Huang He and along the  coast, and the city-wide networks. Efforts will be made to link  all the systems of fund clearance at all levels throughout the  nation into a major network. Meanwhile, we must set up and  improve all kinds of systems concerning information exchange,  fund transactions and price quotations on stocks and bonds,  inter-bank loans and foreign exchange control; gradually put  these systems to effective use; and raise the overall efficiency  of the automation system in the financial circles.</p>

			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GLENDALE GETS CONSERVATIVE WITH BUDGET;  </P> <P> SPENDING: REFUSING TO RAISE TAXES, THE CITY COUNCIL OUTLINES A PLAN THAT  INCLUDES NO NEW PROGRAMS AND FREEZES CITY SERVICES.  </P> <P> After a year of unprecedented growth in city services, the city of Glendale  will return to fiscally conservative ways next year by adopting an almost  zero-growth budget, officials said this week.  </P> <P> The new budget should allow for inflation increases and additional personnel in  the Police and Planning departments, but no new programs will be added,  officials determined at a City Council study session in which a preliminary  1990-91 budget proposal was discussed.  </P> <P> In addition to freezing city services at current levels, council members  instructed City Manager David Ramsay to cut a number of capital improvement  projects that were part of a five-year plan in an attempt to make capital  expenditure match revenues.  </P> <P> Council members said they would not raise taxes and would not sign a budget  with more than a 5% increase to keep up with inflation. That would limit the  size of the new budget to about $255 million.  </P> <P> They said they were caught by surprise with the growth of last year's spending  program of almost three times the inflation rate. They called Monday's study  session to make sure that city staff understood the council's priorities for  the upcoming budget.  </P> <P> "I want to be clear about this. If we are going to run the city like a  business, we can't pay for what we can't afford," Councilman Larry Zarian said  after the session. "I won't sign a budget with an increase above the inflation  level because I'm not willing to raise taxes."  </P> <P> The final budget proposal will be presented to council members in mid-May for  adoption before June 1.  </P> <P> The preliminary proposal introduced Monday seemed to satisfy the council's  desire to reduce spending. The plan calls for no significant additions to the  city bureaucracy, and Glendale would continue to operate without bond  indebtedness.  </P> <P> The Planning Department would add two employees to its environmental review  program and two more to the General Plan update program. The number of police  officers added will be determined in upcoming weeks by a task force headed by  Assistant City Manager Bob McFall, who is evaluating police needs.  </P> <P> The city would also add a handful of employees in other departments, but that  number will be nowhere close to this year's increase, Butler said.  </P> <P> A number of projects were scrapped from the five-year capital improvement plan  after it was determined their combined cost would exceed the $100 million in  expected revenues by $25 million.  </P> <P> Among the projects postponed indefinitely were the relocation of Fire Station  No. 26, the construction of a police helicopter hangar, the installation of  video cameras in City Council chambers and the construction of a landscaped  median on Foothill Boulevard.  </P> <P> Nearly $19 million for such projects as the expansion of Brand Library, street  resurfacing programs, traffic lights and a public art program will not be  affected by the proposed budget.  </P> <P> To increase revenues, the council will consider additional fees on developers  in high-density zones, an increase in guest taxes at hotels and motels and an  increase in dumping fees for cities that use Glendale's Scholl Canyon Landfill,  officials said.  </P> <P> But council members emphatically opposed the possibility of raising or imposing  new licensing fees and other business taxes. "The businesses are what make  Glendale successful," Zarian said.  </P> <P> Electricity rates will not go up, but water rates will rise by 7% and refuse  rates by 5% to keep up with inflation, according to the preliminary budget.  Sewer rates would double to pay for Glendale's share of capital improvement  costs for the Hyperion plant in Santa Monica, which receives the city's treated  sewage before it is discharged into the bay. After next year, Butler said,  sewage-rate increases will return to single-digit, inflation adjustment levels.  </P> <P> The city departed from its customary austerity last year to meet demands from a  rapidly growing population. City Manager David Ramsay's budget for 1989-90 was  12% higher than the previous year's. The $243 million spending package added 64  new employees, created several new departments and programs, and for the first  time in at least 10 years, it showed a small deficit.  </P> <P> Although the deficit of less than $1 million for a city with ample reserves was  considered negligible by Finance Director Brian Butler, it was the first time  in years Glendale did not increase the amount in its investment portfolio made  up with the city's reserves. "We hope we don't start a trend," Butler said.  </P></p>

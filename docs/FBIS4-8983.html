			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Center Alliance Chairman Jaroslaw Kaczynski </F> by Amelia Lukasiak; place and date not given]    [Text] [Lukasiak] How do you assess the present economic  program? Is it a continuation of the previous policy?  Contrasting opinions are being voiced on this subject.    [Kaczynski] On the whole, it is a continuation of the old  policy, with certain compromises made for the sake of particular  causes--for example, the interests of the farming community. Of  course, attempts to "dilute" the main tenets of the economic  program are being made in order to disguise the fact that it is  still the old program.    [Lukasiak] But the condition of the economy does not seem to  be too bad. After all, in the course of one year, we recorded  economic growth to the tune of 12 percent.    [Kaczynski] Precisely. If production grew by 12 percent  during one year, we can assume that, with a real transformation  of the state, we could achieve a result many times that.  However, if this is to happen, we must cut through a network of  ties and connections between a narrow band of people controlling  mainly banks and large enterprises. Contrary to the  expectations of such prognosticators as, for example, Professor  Jadwiga Staniszkis, large capital controlled partly by private  owners and partly by the state does not lead to rationalization  of the economy. It is in our economic interest to transfer that  capital outside and boost consumption.    [Lukasiak] If the economic program of the present government  is a continuation of the previous government's policy, then why,  in your opinion, does the Democratic Union criticize it?    [Kaczynski] Because, in the first place, the Democratic  Union is in opposition, so it must criticize the government's  policy; in the second place, as I said, the program has become  diluted; finally, after finding itself in opposition, the  Democratic Union seems to be changing its values slightly in  relation to those it was promoting before. Let me remind you  that that group carried out a policy that was openly oriented  toward an eventual handing over of power to communists. All of  the tenets of the Democratic Union's policy were erroneous, in  both the economic and the political sphere. Now they are trying  to move away from their previous line in various aspects.    [Lukasiak] How doe you assess the present power  configuration? Why are the ruling parties--that is, the Polish  Peasant Party [PSL] and the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD],  which, after all, share the same Polish People's Republic [PPR]  pedigree--unable to arrive at a joint position in such key  questions?    [Kaczynski] At present, we have a triangular configuration  between the Belweder, the SLD, and the PSL. There is open war  going on along two arms of the triangle. Sparks also fly  occasionally along the third arm,--hat is, the connection  between the Belweder and the PSL--but, on the whole, the two  actually engage in far-reaching cooperation. However, the  association is a tactical one because I do not believe it is  very likely that the farmers will give Walesa much support in  the election campaign. Walesa is very unpopular in the rural  community. Even the strong PSL apparatus, with its firm  foothold in the rural sector, could only lose much and gain  nothing if it tried to promote Walesa there. Apart from that,  Walesa is an extremely disloyal partner, and the PSL is only too  aware of that.    [Lukasiak] So what is the nature of the Belweder-PSL  alliance? What does it rest on?    [Kaczynski] Thanks to the alliance, the weaker coalition  partner--that is, the PSL--gains some real strength because of  the support it has from the Belweder and is able to break up  internally the stronger partner, the SLD. The only question is,  why did the SLD decide to enter into such a configuration at  all? I was convinced from the start that there was a firm  conditional compact concerning the solution of the question of  Walesa's presidency through a speedy promulgation of the new  Constitution at the beginning of 1994. However, the present  developments I have watched seem to be rather naively amusing  and lead me to formulate only one conclusion: It was easy to  play at politics from behind the backs of the Motorized Reserve  of the Citizens' Militia [ZOMO] and the Security Service and,  even later, in the hothouse conditions created by the Democratic  Union and Walesa, when, on the one hand, as representatives of  the left-wing orientation, certain politicians belonged to the  lowest paid social group and, on the other, they were able to  take the most advantage of the existing economic situation.    [Lukasiak] In your opinion, how realistic are the voices,  which can be heard from many directions, saying that in May we  might have a new government based on the PSL, which will try to  lean toward the right?    [Kaczynski] This is a logical option if you look at it from  Walesa's viewpoint. However, it is only so if you assume that  the PSL decides not to nominate its own presidential candidate  and agrees to support Walesa. On the other hand, gaining entry  into such a government could be a very attractive proposition  for many politicians of the right-wing orientation who have lost  their chance in their own parties.    [Lukasiak] You have already partly answered my next  question, but would you still tell us what you believe is the  source of the president's strength at the moment? After all, he  keeps winning successive battles even though he is under  criticism from both the right-wing and left-wing camps.    [Kaczynski] Walesa's strength lies in the dreadful  opportunism of our political circles. The vast majority of our  politicians are not capable of opposing him, either because they  are too afraid or because they are hoping for some advantages if  they do not stand up to him. Let me remind you that, in our  debate on the Small Constitution, I moved in favor of a very  precise definition of the president's range of competence, so  that we should not have to face the sort of situation we are  facing today. At that time, Jerzy Jaskiernia (SLD) battled  determinedly in order to force through the solution we have in  the Small Constitution now. After all, the PSL and the SLD  together could have created the sort of government from which  the president would now helplessly "bounce off" like a ball  thrown against a solid wall. In 1992, having 43 seats at our  disposal after the election, we formed a government in which the  Interior Ministry and the National Defense Ministry remained  entirely outside the Belweder's sphere of influence.    Every time, we have the same situation: Either Walesa is  feared too much, or someone needs his support too much. After  all, Suchocka was permanently terrified because she suspected  that certain people were forever approaching Walesa about the  prime minister's post and that Walesa promised that post  indiscriminately to various individuals around him.    [Lukasiak] How do you assess the president's attempts to  influence the formulation of the constitution, such as, for  example, the proposal to set up a "people's constitutional  initiative"?    [Kaczynski] That is a gambit played with an eye on the  public and Solidarity, as well as a "wink" directed at the  right-wing orientation: You would be well-advised to gather  around me, get rid of your leaders because they have failed you,  and unite under my protection....    [Lukasiak] But after your defeat in the election you  yourself were ready to call a truce in your war with the  president, were you not?    [Kaczynski] Let me explain the essence of my reaction at the  time. It was composed of two parts. First, I was not taking  back anything I had said earlier, but I was ready to try to  judge the president by his deeds. If I had not said that, there  would have been no alliance of the right wing today. Already as  a coalition, we issued several statements directed against  Walesa. We did not have to wait long for his reaction. A number  of cases that had been brought against me and that by then were  about to be dropped were suddenly reactivated again.    [Lukasiak] You recently said in a court case brought by  Wieslaw Chrzanowski against Piotr Wierzbicki, chief editor of  GAZETA POLSKA, for publishing his name on the list of so-called  confidential agents that, according to your information,  Chrzanowski was not a secret agent of the Security Agency  [UB]....    [Kaczynski] All I said was that there was no evidence that  Chrzanowski collaborated with UB, although ,in the majority of  cases under investigation, such evidence had come to light. The  documents to which I had access contained the information that  Chrzanowski was first registered as a collaborator and  subsequently struck off the list because there was no evidence  of any collaboration on his part. Why was he registered in the  first place? I do not know, but it is wrong to claim on the  strength of it that he was a confidential agent. However, it  still does not mean that Wierzbicki could not have believed so  in good faith on the strength of that list because the vast  majority of the names of the confident agents' list refer to  people who in reality were collaborating with UB.    [Lukasiak] Is security vetting possible, or indeed  necessary, today?    [Kaczynski] There will be no order here without security  vetting. Security vetting is essential: I have not the  slightest doubt about it. I do, however, have doubts about  whether it is possible to call to account the companies set up  by the old nomenklatura, which are now going bankrupt  on a massive scale. After all, their money was transferred so  many times from one place to another without actual infringement  of the ownership system.    [Lukasiak] You spoke about a number of major frauds and  rackets in our banking networks a long time ago. The truth  behind your warnings was confirmed by reports from the Supreme  Chamber of Control [NIK], but no one took particular note of  them at the time. Now the fraud is slowly beginning to be  disclosed to the public. Why do you think it has taken so long?    [Kaczynski] Those who are now sounding the alarm must admit  our diagnosis was correct and that we did predict the outcome.  Now our own warnings and advice are being kidnapped from us. I  am afraid that it may turn out before very long that the  Democratic Union is the mother party of all "decommunizers."  Consequently, I am inclined to ask a tongue-in-cheek question of  Democratic Union politicians and GAZETA WYBORCZA editors: How  do they feel in the role of political "cranks"?    [Lukasiak] Thank you for talking to us.</p>

			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Markets: How do we profit from profiteers? - Serious Money Should consumers fight back against profiteering by buying shares in the profiteers? Last month, water shares rose because the price review was less tough than feared. This week, electricity shares soared for the same reason (see page III for details). And Royal Insurance got a warm welcome when it announced profits which included an underwriting profit of more than 17 per cent on its UK consumer business. There are, however, important differences between the water and electricity businesses and general insurance. One reason why the utility companies are such a joy to the investor is that the regulators control their prices not their profits. So provided the companies can squeeze their own costs, there is theoretically no limit to the amount by which profits can rise. Add to that their effective local monopolies, and the inflation-proofing implicit in the price control mechanism, and you have a real licence to print money. The insurance business nowadays is very different indeed. It may be sporadically profitable in certain areas, but overall it no longer makes money on its basic underwriting business. Insurance shares may look attractive right now - but they have been a lousy long-term investment. Yet, until the middle of this century, general insurance companies did make good profits from underwriting. Up to the 1950s they normally made around 5 per cent. This margin slipped back to around 2 per cent in the 1960s, and in the 1970s underwriting moved into the red, where it has broadly stayed ever since. Some 20 years ago, a former chairman of Royal, Sir Paul Chambers, famously predicted a return to underwriting profits of 5 per cent. His mistake was to assume that history would repeat itself. The trend towards investing in equities encouraged insurance companies to rely on stock market gains for part of their profits. Competition drove insurance premium rates down. And the hitherto cosy world of the big insurance companies was irrevocably gone. There are some useful investment points to note here. First, and fairly obvious, always look at the whole of a company's business, not just the bit that affects you. Second, look not just for good profits but for sustainable profits - at least if you are a long term investor, rather than a speculator. Finally, always bear in mind that long term changes in business and investment do happen. Consols had their day, and so did general insurance companies. Utilities are still enjoying theirs. But keep one eye on the horizon. Back to that 17 per cent profit Royal made on its consumer business. The actual figures were 18 per cent on household (buildings and contents) business and 15 per cent on motor. Motor insurance premiums are already on the way down (see Weekend FT July 30, page V) and household rates are coming back a bit. But the insurers do not expect them to fall as much as motor rates. The people who are forcing rates down are the direct insurers who cut out the middleman and sell by telephone. They can offer better deals, because their cost are less, and competitors have to follow. But it is harder for the direct insurers to nose into the household market than into motor. Why? One reason is that something like 40 per cent of all household insurance comes via building societies. The societies get commission of up to 30 per cent of the premiums, which does wonders for their overall financial well-being. Broadly, for every Pounds 100 you pay in household insurance premiums some 30 - 35 per cent goes in commission and other costs, 15 to 20 per cent in profits, and at most half is actually spent on paying claims. The building societies defense of their rather comfortable commission has always been a double one. First, they do a lot of the admin for the insurance companies. Secondly, the profit they make from their insurance commissions subsidises their mortgage business. Maybe. But perhaps consumers would like to make their own choices. The brave new world of compulsory disclosure is looming over the life insurance companies. How about some voluntary disclosure of who gets what from your household insurance premiums? Kids' lib apart, the new Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester sweeteners are rather damp squibs. Very broadly, more depositors will benefit, mainly because the qualifying date is later. (See page V) Borrowers miss out, but get a warm nod and wink from C &amp; G boss Andrew Longhurst. How much is that worth? When the Lloyd's offer was originally announced C &amp; G hinted that it was confident its sweetener proposal would work and would fight for it in the Courts if necessary. But when the High Court turned it down, C &amp; G appeared reluctantly to concede that there was no point in fight-ing. The Department of Trade recently closed some illegal pyramid selling schemes. Some of the victims are forming an action group to fight the DTI's intrusion, which they consider an infringement of civil liberties.</p>

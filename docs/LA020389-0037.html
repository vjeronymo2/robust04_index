			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BID TO CONTAIN ANTARCTIC OIL SPILL STALLED  </P> <P> Foul weather off the tip of South America on Thursday forced one Argentine ship  to abandon its effort to reach a stricken vessel that is leaking oil into the  pristine waters off Antarctica, and scientists warned that as winter approaches  in the Southern Hemisphere, storms could soon cut off any hopes of salvaging  the ship and containing the spill.  </P> <P> "If they don't solve it right away, the winter storms will tear it up," said  UCLA marine biologist Bill Hamner, who has spent five seasons studying the area  where the ship ran around last Saturday just two miles from the National  Science Foundation's Palmer Station. A second Argentine vessel should arrive in  the area today, but it is not clear if that ship is equipped to attempt salvage  operations.  </P> <P> The foundation said that the stricken ship was still afloat despite earlier  reports that it had sunk.  </P> <P> Hamner and others said the accident could not have happened at a worse time for  the wildlife in the area, particularly the penguins.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Birds' Insulation in Peril  </P> <P> One of Antarctica's largest penguin colonies is in the area, Hamner said, "and  this is the time when the penguins are fishing most heavily" and young penguins  are beginning to swim.  </P> <P> That will expose them to the oily water and tar that could destroy the  insulation system that protects them from the cold temperatures.  </P> <P> Hamner said the penguin's feathers trap a layer of air between "the skin and  the outside, so the birds can swim in ice water, and they are not cold because  they are beautifully insulated. It probably wouldn't require very much tar to  break down the insulation and bring cold into direct contact with the body  core."  </P> <P> Anton L. Inderbitzen, head of the Antarctic staff for the National Science  Foundation, told reporters in Santiago, Chile, that the greatest concern now is  that the oil will affect the young birds.  </P> <P> "All the young penguins are just about at the age where they take their first  swim," he said. "When these birds enter the water for the first time, it could  be the last time."  </P> <P> There were conflicting reports Thursday over just how much oil has already  leaked from the vessel, which is 80% under water but still afloat, according to  Jack Renirie, spokesman for the National Science Foundation in Washington. The  Argentine Ministry of Defense initially said the leakage from the Argentine  cruise ship, the Bahia Paraiso, "really wasn't a significant spill" but later  conceded some contamination is inevitable.  </P> <P> Observers in the area radioed to officials in Washington that a spill several  miles long had been sighted.  </P> <P> Any spill in such a pristine area is bound to have a serious local impact,  although Renirie said the incident was not likely to be as "catastrophic" as  some reports have indicated.  </P> <P> "This was not a tanker," Renirie said. The ship was carrying about 250,000  gallons of bunker oil used for its own propulsion system, plus 200 barrels of  other types of fuel.  </P> <P> By contrast, large tankers carry many millions of gallons of oil and are  capable of creating massive oil slicks during accidents.  </P> <P> The temperature in the area is running in the mid-40s, because it is still  summer in Antarctica, but winter is rapidly approaching. Heavy storms could hit  the area by the end of this month, and by late March the weather is expected to  be so foul that little could be done.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Killed Every Animal  </P> <P> When the tanker Tampico ran aground near Ensenada in April, 1957, it released  diesel fuel into the Pacific, and Stewart said it proved extremely toxic to  marine life.  </P> <P> "It essentially killed every animal in the area," he said.  </P> <P> U.S. experts with 52 tons of cleanup gear arrived in Chile on Thursday aboard a  U.S. Air Force C-5B. From there the experts and their equipment were to be  loaded aboard the U.S. research ship Polar Duke for the 600-mile, four-day trip  to Antarctica.  </P> <P> All 316 persons aboard the 435-foot Bahia Paraiso were rescued by other vessels  in the area.  </P></p>

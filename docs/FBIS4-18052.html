			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed photofeature: "Spring Draft: What Will </F> Response Be?"]    [Text]Defense Ministry's Position    Major General Vasiliy Smirnov, deputy chief of the Russian  Federation Defense Ministry's Main Organization and Mobilization  Directorate:    "There have been no extra changes to the legislation under  which the draft is organized.    "The right to a draft deferment is granted for the duration  of a citizen's studies within the limits of the normative  timetable for the assimilation of basic educational programs  under the set standard provisions for state and municipal  educational institutions...."    In other words, students at commercial nonstate higher  educational establishments have no right to a deferment until  the educational establishments receive their state accreditation!    It should be recalled that deferments are issued once only  --  in order for people to complete their studies! If a student  gives up his studies or merely transfers to another higher  educational establishment, his deferment ends. Even if there is  a military faculty at the new establishment. That is the law.    Currently there is no mechanism for implementing alternative  service. This service is mentioned only in one place -- Article  59 of the Russian Federation Constitution. But there are  currently no other acts of legislation on this service (where it  should take place, or what the mechanism for its implementation  should be).  <H5>  Legislators' Position </H5>   The questions of the Russian Army draft are regulated by the  law "On the Military Draft and Military Service" previously  adopted by the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet. Subsequent  changes relating to the military draft procedure were made to  this law by a Russian Federation presidential edict. The State  Duma's Defense Committee believes that, following the adoption  of the new Constitution, the law should be brought into line  with the fundamental law. The committee is now doing  corresponding work in this area. Moreover, work is under way on  a legislative substantiation of the constitutional provision on  alternative service. Some draftees who refuse to be drafted on  religious or other grounds are currently subject to criminal  prosecution in the absence of an appropriate law. The scale of  this phenomenon is such that, in the opinion of certain  representatives of the Duma Committee for the Affairs of Public  Associations and Religious Organizations, it is possible to talk  about "prisoners of conscience" in this country -- which is a  direct consequence of the lack of a federal law on alternative  service.  <H5>  Opinion of the Committee of Soldiers' Mothers </H5>   "The law on education and the constitutionally guaranteed  right to a professional education were violated last year,"  Valentina Melnikova, press secretary of the Committee of  Soldiers' Mothers, says. "Edict No. 1573 `On the Military Draft  of Russian Federation Citizens of Draft Age Studying By Day at  Initial and Secondary Vocational Educational Establishments' was  issued in October. The spring draft to the Army will again  deprive many young people of an opportunity to get an education.  And if this continues, then, in the opinion of sociologists and  economists, the system of vocational and technical education in  the country will be completely destroyed."    Independent Lawyer's View    "Under the new Russian Constitution citizens have the right  to substitute community [grazhdanskiy] service for military  service," Sergey Sorokin, chairman of the "Movement Against  Violence" public organization, said.    "The right to alternative service has been recognized --  back  on 22 November 1991 -- and it is necessary to observe the law.  There is no alternative service in Russia today, nor should  there be! A draftee who wishes to opt for alternative service  should stay home and wait for the notorious law on alternative  service to see the light of day."  <H5>  From the Resolution of the International Conference under </H5> the Slogan "Rights of People in Uniform"    It shall be deemed necessary to set up an organ of military  reform, transforming the Defense Ministry into a political and  administrative department headed by a civilian;    the wording of contracts shall be revised with a view to  increasing the state's responsibility for carrying out its  obligations to servicemen;    the number of combined and other units staffed by men from  other units shall be reduced;    the number of military educational establishments and the  number of officers graduating from them shall be reduced;    with a view to eliminating bullying and bringing about the  spiritual revival of the Army and Navy in the transitional  period prior to the reformation of the Army into a professional  army, professional schools for noncommissioned officers or  sergeants shall be established to ensure that they serve only on  a contract basis;    we shall strive for an end to the Army and Navy draft of  young people with medical problems;    we shall strive for the adoption in 1994 of a law on  alternative service.  <H5>  Facts and Figures </H5>   According to figures from the Russian Federation Defense  Ministry Main Organization and Mobilization Directorate for 1993:    The plan for the draft was 90.3 percent fulfilled, which is  approximately the level of previous years.    This year it is planned to draft 216,000 people to active  military service in Russia (in the Russian Federation Armed  Forces, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Russian Border  Troops, and so forth).    As of March 1993, 41,000 people had dodged the draft in  Russia. The same year 470 people were convicted of draft-dodging  and administrative proceedings were instituted against more than  10,000 draft-dodgers.    As of today the Russian Armed Forces are at 58.9 percent of  their full strength with soldiers and sailors.    In 1993 some 120,000 "contract servicemen" were drafted to  the ranks of the Armed Forces in Russia as a whole. In 1994 a  Russian Federation presidential edict has given the Defense  Ministry permission to draft 150,000 "contract servicemen."  Some 20,000 have already been drafted as of today.</p>

			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / How To Spend It: Craftsmen's way out of the woods IT HARDLY needs saying that craftsmen today are hungry for work and so there could hardly be a better time to think about commissioning something special. Order times at the moment are shorter than ever, designers keener and ever-more ingenious at finding ways of keeping quality up and prices down. Two workshops that anybody in need of an unusual piece might find worth investigating are Rhode Design and Simon Stocker. Rhode Design's new range, The Boston Collection, (above) is based on the American country look and is well priced. The shelving unit on the right, for instance, is Pounds 275 (ready-painted and including VAT) while the sideboard is Pounds 475 and the blue and gold cotton rug or 'throw', 4ft by 6ft, is Pounds 55. Although these pieces can be seen and bought at Rhode Design's showroom at 86 Stoke Newington Church Street, London N16 OAP, (Tel: 071-275-8261), the workshop's speciality is furniture made to special order. Some readers may remember its Shaker-inspired kitchen collection which was featured last year. A hand-made, specially designed kitchen, painted in the colours of your choice (it has a marvellous range of traditional earth pigment paints) can be had for roughly the same price as an off-the-peg kitchen from one of the multiples. As well as making to order anything a customer fancies, Rhode Design also stocks a limited range of furniture which Brian Innes, the artist, has embellished with his painting. Other pieces can be painted to order. Simon Stocker, whose dressing-table and stool in American ash is photographed left, also makes furniture to order. He has found that, in these tough times, budgets are smaller and more carefully considered. As a result, Stocker has devised simpler, less expensive ways of producing fine work. He is, for instance, building a kitchen using plywood and he has found that by cutting an edge off at an angle he can produce decorative handles. 'It is simple and it is cheap,' he says. 'One of the things more and more customers are looking for.' Although he works mainly in wood, glass and metal are sometimes incorporated.

			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SON OF ACTORS IRELAND AND MCCALLUM FOUND DEAD  </P> <P> Jason David McCallum -- the son of actor David McCallum and actress Jill  Ireland -- whose troubled life and battles against drugs and alcohol were a  focus of Ireland's recently published book "Life Lines," was found dead in his  Laurel Canyon home, police said Wednesday.  </P> <P> The body of the 27-year-old McCallum was found by his girlfriend, Tracy Medina,  on the bathroom floor of his rented apartment early Tuesday evening, Los  Angeles police spokeswoman Margie Reid said.  </P> <P> Cause of death was unknown, she said, adding that "there were no signs of foul  play, no obvious signs of trauma to the body."  </P> <P> Reid would not comment on whether drugs were involved.  </P> <P> A spokesman for the Los Angeles County coroner said an autopsy would be  performed today, but results of toxicological tests would not be known for a  week to 10 days.  </P> <P> McCallum was adopted by David McCallum, star of the former TV series "The Man  From U.N.C.L.E.," and Ireland in 1962, according to Ireland's book. After the  couple divorced, Ireland married actor Charles Bronson.  </P> <P> Lori Jonas, spokeswoman for Ireland, said the actress was flying to Los Angeles  on Wednesday from her Vermont home.  </P> <P> "She's making no comment until she knows the cause of death," Jonas said. "They  don't know if this was a drug overdose or a medical problem."  </P> <P> Earlier, however, Ireland, released this statement:  </P> <P> "I hate drugs. Jason had shown signs of being on the road to recovery. The book  meant a lot to Jason, and he hoped it would keep other young people from going  through what he had gone through."  </P> <P> David McCallum could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> A friend, who asked not to be identified, said the tall, dark-haired McCallum  was a "shy, very withdrawn" young man who, except for occasional acting jobs  playing bit parts, did not work.  </P> <P> He appeared to be supported financially by Ireland and Bronson, the friend  added, though just two days ago McCallum told him: "I'm going to find a job  next week."  </P> <P> "He wasn't unhappy. I would rule out his taking his own life," the friend said.  </P> <P> McCallum had moved into the apartment only about a week ago, the friend said,  with his new girlfriend, Medina.  </P> <P> In "Life Lines," Ireland said McCallum had had troubles since his teens with  cocaine, alcohol and heroin, and made numerous failed attempts at  rehabilitation. His recurring addictions seemed to parallel Ireland's own  recurring struggles with cancer, which she contracted five years ago. But she  wrote that of the two battles, Jason's was more painful to her than her own.  </P> <P> "I suddenly knew what it meant when people wrote that someone's heart breaks,"  she wrote of the moment when she learned her son was a heroin addict. "I felt  as if mine were shattered. It gave me more pain and fear than when I learned I  had cancer. I could fight for my own life. But even with all the energy and  force I could muster, I realized I would get nowhere in this battle unless  Jason fought harder."  </P> <P> At a publication party for the book last April, however, McCallum told a  reporter that he had spent a month in a recovery program and had been clean and  sober for two months. According to others, however, McCallum did go back on  drugs after that.  </P> <P> But in recent weeks, he had been under the care of a Los Angeles internist, Dr.  Howard Mark. Mark said he treated McCallum for "poly drug abuse" with  buprenorphine, a Federal Drug Administration-approved drug that he said recent  studies have shown has promise for detoxification from opiate and cocaine  addiction. McCallum had made remarkable progress within two weeks, Mark said.  </P> <P> "He was a very nice person, with a great sense of humor," the physician said  Wednesday. "I said to myself, this guy has a chance. He's only 27. I don't know  what happened."  </P></p>

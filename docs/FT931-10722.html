			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Minding Your Own Business: How I cut my rates - Stephen Halliday on how he wrested a reduction from his district valuer RATES ARE one of the largest overheads for many small businesses, particularly retailers, yet they are often regarded as untouchable. My recent experience suggests that, with a little determination and the right advice, they can be reduced. Business rates are determined by two separate elements, neither of which is controlled by the local authority. The first is the rateable value of the property. This is established by the district valuer, an official of the Inland Revenue who has no connection with the local authority. The rateable value supposedly reflects the rent at which the property could have been let on a normal commercial basis at the valuation date, April 1 1988. The district valuer will take into account many factors. These include the position of the property in relation to other traders; the shape, since a retail unit with a long frontage is regarded as more desirable, and the current rents paid by the property and by nearby premises. The rates are then calculated by applying the uniform business rate to the rateable value. This is set annually by the government and is 40.2p in the Pounds 1, but the chancellor has proposed a rise to 41.6p from April. At the current rate property with a rateable value of Pounds 10,000 would be paying Pounds 4,020 in rates. Rateable values are supposed to be revised every five years but the last revaluation before 1988 was in 1973. Rents in the south of England had outstripped those in the north, while retail rents had risen more quickly than those for industrial properties. When the rateable values for 1988 were published retailers in the south had some unpleasant surprises. An appeals procedure exists so traders who believe their rateable values have been incorrectly assessed can take their case to an independent tribunal. My experience of this procedure was initially discouraging but ultimately successful. When the new rateable values were published in 1990, I wrote to the district valuer saying that I considered the values he had established were excessive because we had recently negotiated a new rent which was considerably lower than the rateable value he had proposed. We received a prompt reply which said: 'On the information presently available to me, I do not consider your proposal to be well founded and I do not intend to alter the rating list.' Some months later, we vacated part of the premises. I wrote again to the valuer explaining this and asked for a reassessment. Again, we received a prompt reply but it contained the same discouraging (and this time extraordinary) statement. I wrote again explaining that our former storerooms had been occupied by another trader. Was the valuer proposing that we should pay the rates for the new tenant? Or did he intend to collect rates from both of us? Five weeks passed. I telephoned the office, and was told that the letter was a standard one, generated by a computer, and was sent to all applicants regardless of the merit of a particular case. The letter did not mean what it said. What it meant was that my perfectly sensible request was being dealt with and that the rateable value would shortly be reduced. The official said the letter was a standard one and had been drafted by their legal department. He also told me that my original objection to the rateable values would be receiving further consideration and that I would be hearing from them in due course. In July 1992, two years after my original objection, I was notified that a valuation tribunal would take place within the month. I was invited to contact the district valuation officer in an attempt to resolve our differences without recourse to the tribunal. At the same time, I was contacted by a local chartered surveyor. He said he would be putting the cases of a number of local traders and offered to take my case, arguing that a knowledge of valuation principles and local rental agreements would enable him to present a stronger case than I could. If he failed to secure a cut in the rateable value I would not have to pay him. If he succeeded he would invoice me for the equivalent of six months' rates saved. I asked him to act on my behalf. He based his case on the actual rent that we were paying, backed up with evidence of rents of surrounding properties, and won a reduction. He secured a further significant reduction on a technical point: the availability of toilet facilities within the building which apparently do not bear rates. The combined effect was to reduce the rateable value (and consequently the rates) by more than 20 per cent. I have this morning received a cheque for nearly Pounds 1,500 from my local authority in compensation for rates I have over-paid since April 1 1990, including over Pounds 100 in interest. My affairs had been settled 'out of court' but I went to the tribunal anyway out of curiosity. The tribunal consisted of three lay people who had received training in valuation principles but had no connection with the local authority or the valuer. They received evidence in an informal way from each side in turn. Of 64 objections lodged with the district valuer only two appeared before the tribunal. All the others were either withdrawn or settled beforehand. I was left with two strong impressions. The first was that the valuer was well prepared. He argued his case clearly and produced evidence to support his arguments. The chartered surveyor who acted for the appellant was not so well prepared. It emerged that he was not a local man. He came from a practice in London and was unfamiliar with rents and rates in the small town under discussion. Almost all of the cases which had been settled beforehand had been handled by local firms. The next re-valuation is due to take place on April 1 1993 and will take effect in April 1995. If you feel you have a case for a lower valuation, collect evidence now.</p>

			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / IRA said to be near 'major decision' The head of an Irish-American delegation due to meet leaders of Sinn Fein today said yesterday that he was 'renewed' in his belief that the IRA was on the verge of a 'major decision', strengthening speculation that the IRA will announce a ceasefire within two weeks. Mr Bruce Morrison, a former US congressman, said after an hour-long meeting in Dublin with the Irish prime minister and foreign minister that the objective of his visit to Dublin and Belfast was to help achieve 'an end to violence through a broad-based political process'. Mr Morrison said: 'All political leaders should grasp the straws, whatever they are, which lead towards peace . . . and try to take the steps which will turn it into a permanent cessation.' The Irish Foreign Ministry said the US delegation was briefed on the Irish government's view of the peace process. It was stressed that the government sought 'a total cessation of violence'. Mr Morrison, considered a close friend of Mr Bill Clinton, the US president, confirmed yesterday that he would report to the White House on his return to the US. In Belfast yesterday a senior figure in Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, said that an 'unprecedented opportunity to get down to the nuts and bolts' of the conflict lay ahead, which he hoped would lead to 'multi-party dialogue'. Although unable to confirm whether an extended IRA ceasefire was imminent, he said: 'The IRA know a short ceasefire was not seen as sufficient before. They are moving towards a decision and no obstacles remain in the way at the moment.' He said Sinn Fein had invited the US delegation to meet the party's leadership 'to help broker a permanent peace in Northern Ireland. We are not looking for them to be behind Sinn Fein, but to be behind a strategy to get a settlement.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Part one" of commentary by Abdulkarim Algese; from the "In </F> Focus" program]    [Text] Contrary to propaganda in certain quarters, the  national conference which has now opened in Abuja was never the  creation of the Abacha regime. The original champions were the  so-called Campaign for Democracy group, actively supported by a  vocal section of the media. In an obvious attempt to meet their  demands, the regime on coming to power made it one of their  agenda. As the preparations for its take-off had gone far,  those who originally called for it denounced it with the same  force they called for it. Their complaint is that with the  government nominating 96 of the 369 conference members, the  exercise will not achieve the desired purpose. They are also of  the opinion that since the conference has no sovereign powers,  then it will amount to a wasteful effort participating in it.  The participation of nominated members in a similar conference  is consistent with precedence.    It was so during Obasanjo and Babangida. [sentence as heard]  The complaint that the nominated members will be taking  dictations from government cannot reasonably hold bearing in  mind the national standing of those involved. No matter what  else may be said of them, they are men and women who cannot be  pushed around by anybody. Indeed, it is valid to say that they  have added credibility to the conference and the sincerity of  government.    On the question of sovereignty, the truth is that there can  never be two sovereign powers in any state. Those of us who  want to copy Zaire and Togo need to be told that the attempt  failed in both countries. The constitutional nature of the  conference is based on the fact that its deliberations will be  incorporated into the Constitution. There was a new dimension  to the position of Nadeco [National Democratic Coalition]  members who called for the boycott of the conference. According  to reports, they were said to have written a secret letter to  government pleading that their members be nominated. This is  the same Nadeco that launched a campaign of boycott of the  conference now wishing to participate through the back door.    Some Nigerians can really be clever by half. They succeeded  in dissuading some prominent and intelligent persons from  certain parts of the country not to take part in the elections  leading to the conference, while they were secretly pleading for  nominations. It is a pity that such intelligent persons should  easily be deceived. The atmosphere leading to the conference was  one of zealous emotion, ethnocentricity, and beclouded  objectivity. Never was excessive tribalism at its height and  never was the relevance and importance of Nigerian nationhood so  disgraced.    A nation is the lifeline of a people. It is their dignity  and symbol of pride. Think of the early explorers and colonial  administrators who lost their lives for the glory of their  respective nations. A people without a nation are orphans. The  Palestinians could tell the story better. A country is the most  priceless commodity that people could have.    Those who want the disintegration of Nigeria should  seriously  reflect on what is currently happening in the former Soviet  Union. Here was a country feared and respected and one of the  most powerful in the world, strong enough to fight both Western  Europe and mighty America. Alas, after its painful  disintegration it has now become the errand servant of Europe  and America. At the height of glory, the USSR dictated to the  world. Today, it carries out American instructions. Its powers  are no more, its glory gone to the winds, and its pride badly  ridiculed. This is the price a disintegrated nation has to pay.    A tightly united country is honey, a dismembered one  tasteless. The conference delegates have no reasons whatsoever  to give us a shattered nation at the end of their deliberations.  If indeed they are, then they should bear in mind that the  masses of the people are for a united Nigeria. [sentence as  heard] Besides, a certain level of integration was taking place  so as to make a breakup unviable. In their deliberations the  delegates must put aside their elitist tendencies and work in  the interest of the greatest number. This is what the people  expect of them. As what may be called the giants of Nigeria,  the masses are full of confidence that their maturity, stand in  the society, and self-esteem, will see them through a purposeful  deliberation.    As members of the ruling class who at one time or the other  presided over the affairs of the nation, they should put a lie  to the popularly held view that they are part of our national  problems, which is why they must conduct their deliberations in  an atmosphere of maturity, understanding, and consideration. To  take a rigid position on issues is unhelpful. Principled and  considerate flexibility should be the strongest weapons. After  all, the exercise is about dialogue and compromise.</p>

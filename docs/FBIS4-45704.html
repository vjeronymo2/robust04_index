			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article from Brussels EUROPE: "Cost of Fiscal </F> Reductions for Bio-Fuels is Reasonable, Says Scrivener"]    [Text] Brussels, 27 May (Agence Europe) - In the framework  of the first European Forum on Bio-Fuels in Tours (France)  earlier this month, the Commissioner responsible for taxation,  Mrs. Scrivener, said that low taxation on bio-fuels over ten  years and in all Member States would cost the Community budget  ECU 33 billion. "This measure is neither overly expensive, nor  threatening to other productions", she said, recalling that the  "long-term objective does not exceed 5 percent of fuel  consumption in Europe". The so-called "Scrivener" proposal,  whose goal is to generalize the fiscal advantages granted since  1993 to bio-fuel products in the framework of pilot projects by  making them compulsory in all Member States and no longer  limiting them simply to these projects, is now on the table of  the Ecofin Council. The Council will have to decide through  unanimity and, according to Mrs. Scrivener, the decisive stage  will occur between now and the summer. The Twelve should,  notably, agree to confirm the compulsory nature of the measure  proposed or, according to the wishes of the European Parliament,  make it optional. For the moment, they are divided: some  Member States are indeed tending towards this latter option, but  others are ready to accept a compulsory lower taxation on these  fuels as, without that, they fear traffic will be defected and  thus a loss in fiscal revenue.</p>

			<p><P> August 5, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Gas Firm Seeks Pipeline Expansion: El Paso Natural Gas Co. said it has filed an  application with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to expand its  interstate pipeline system by up to 600 million cubic feet a day at a cost of  $201 million. The company said the expansion is needed to meet present and  future natural gas needs in its principal market area of California. It said  the California Public Utilities Commission is looking into the need for new  interstate pipeline capacity within the state and also the need for increased  service levels to existing gas users. The company said the incremental  throughput resulting from the proposed system expansion will reduce the average  cost of transportation for all present and future customers.  </P></p>

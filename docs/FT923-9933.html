			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Losses increase to Pounds 125m at Airedale AIREDALE, the private holding company for the Magnet kitchen retailing business, fell further into the red with pre-tax losses of Pounds 125m for the year to March 28. The result, which compared with a loss of Pounds 119m the previous year, was struck on sales 17 per cent down at Pounds 187m. Mr Louis Sherwood, chairman, said 'highly-successful' cost-cutting had helped to cushion operating losses which rose from Pounds 23.5m to Pounds 27m. Net interest charges were similar at Pounds 94.7m (Pounds 95.3m). Airedale, which owes about Pounds 664.2m to bankers following the highly-leveraged management buy-out of Magnet in 1989, earned some Pounds 3.6m on cash deposits. Mr Sherwood said there had been little actual interest paid during the year. Under current financing arrangements, capital and interest payments on the company's loans are rolled up until the end of December. 'In light of recent discussions with the group's senior lenders,' Mr Sherwood said, he was ' confident that satisfactory arrangements will be put in place well before then. Magnet, Airedale's operating company, remained financially sound with net assets of Pounds 160m, a healthy cash balance and no debt, Mr Sherwood said. The subsidiary is shielded from its parent's debts through an arrangement with bankers. Until Magnet forecasts a positive cash balance of Pounds 30m for the following six months, it cannot help pay Airedale's debt or interest. Mr Sherwood said steps had been taken to stem losses in Airedale's retail business. The trade division had moved back into profit, although on lower sales. The pre-tax figure included a Pounds 3.4m exceptional item arising from the introduction of new bedroom ranges. In view of the capital structure of the company, said Mr Sherwood, an earnings per share figure would have little relevance. There was no dividend. Airedale also faces a claim from GE Capital, which is pressing for repayment of Pounds 70m mezzanine debt. The loan was part of Pounds 629m provided for the Magnet MBO. Mr Sherwood said the group would 'defend the actions vigorously'.</p>

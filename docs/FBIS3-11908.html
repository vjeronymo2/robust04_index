			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Javier Rodriguez] </F>   [Text] Havana, 18 Mar (PL) -- Cuban analysts today  positively assessed the fact that the U.S. Congress has started  debating proposals by legislators who are demanding the repeal  of the Torricelli Law and who are calling for free trade with  Cuba.    In statements to PRENSA LATINA, Rafael Hernandez, department  head for the Center for American Studies, said the presentation  and discussion of a draft bill by a group of congressmen headed  by Representative Charles Rangel is important because this will  enable Washington to measure the political cost of its policy  toward Cuba.    Hernandez added that whether or not the repeal is approved,  this discussion shows there is political interest in ending the  blockade against Cuba both within and outside the U.S. Congress .    Hernandez explained that even within the U.S. Administration  itself there are groups that have different ideas on the  subject, and he stressed that because a group within Congress  has adopted this position, greater support could be given to  those arguing in favor of normalizing relations with Havana.    All this makes the U.S. national outlook more complex and  varied, especially on the official governmental level, he said.    Writer and journalist Nicanor Leon Cotayo argued that what  is  taking place in Congress is symbolic of the growing U.S.  awareness of the need to review the blockade policy.    He recalled that Rangel's proposal is not the only one,  noting that others have tried to introduce modifications on bans  preventing U.S. citizens from traveling to Cuba and that there  have been calls for making current limits on medicinal exports  more flexible.    Leon Cotayo said one cannot disregard an increasingly  growing  sentiment among important sectors of U.S. society regarding this  issue.    Leon Cotayo also mentioned the importance of the debate as a  message to the White House -- a message that indicates the  blockade strategy is increasingly being questioned in the United  States.    The Cuban writer described the congressional discussions  that  began the previous day as being significant in terms of the  process of growing opposition to the blockade, which is felt in  the heart of U.S. society.    This makes one think, he concluded, that even if the lifting  of the embargo is not around the corner, we see on the other  hand that it is not so far away.    Evelio Barrios, vice director for the Center for American  Studies, said it is impossible for the U.S. Government to  continue to ignore the political cost the blockade has on its  international image.    He said: What is most important is that this will permit the  assessment of a new consensus being created within Congress on  the issue, even though I do not expect any changes in the  official position in the immediate future.    Barrios also recalled that two UN votes favorable to Cuba  opposed Washington's punitive measures, that editorials in  influential U.S. newspapers have been critical of the blockade,  and that several prominent people have denounced the blockade.    Moreover, the United States sees the serious international  problems it has caused itself by implementing the Torricelli Law  and by trying to destroy Cuba's economy.</p>

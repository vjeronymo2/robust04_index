(``PCS'') from McKesson Corporation (``McKesson''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed consent order (``Order'') has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission will again review the Agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the Agreement or make final the Agreement's proposed Order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission has reason to believe that Lilly's acquisition of PCS would substantially lessen competition in violation of section 7 of the Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 18 and section 5 of the FTC Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 45. The Order, if issued by the Commission, would settle the allegations of the proposed Complaint (``Complaint''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Complaint in this matter alleges that Lilly is engaged in the development, production and sale of pharmaceutical products, including Prozac, an antidepressant (specifically, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor); Humulin, an injectable insulin; Ceclor, an oral antibiotic; and Axid, an anti-ulcer product (specifically, an H2 antagonist). It further alleges that through its subsidiary PCS, McKesson is engaged in the business of providing pharmacy benefit management (``PBM'') services to insurance companies, third party payors, and other members of the healthcare industry. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Complaint further alleges that a relevant line of commerce within which to analyze the effects of this acquisition is the provision of PBM services by national full-service PBM firms, and any narrower markets contained therein. Other relevant lines of commerce within which to analyze the effects of this acquisition are the development, manufacture and sale of pharmaceutical products in specific therapeutic categories, and narrower markets contained therein (including, but not limited to, the markets for injectable insulin, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, H2 antagonists, and anti-ulcer drugs). It further alleges that the relevant market for PBM services by national full-service PBM firms, as well as the relevant markets for pharmaceutical products in specific therapeutic categories, are highly concentrated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Complaint further alleges that there are substantial entry barriers into the relevant markets. Even if new entry were to occur, it would take a long time, during which time substantial harm to competition could occur. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Complaint further alleges that as part of its PBM services, PCS maintains a drug formulary, which is a listing, by therapeutic category, of ambulatory drug products that are approved for use by the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration, and which is made available to pharmacies, physicians, third-party payors, and other persons, to guide in the prescribing and dispensing of pharmaceuticals. Lilly pharmaceutical products are included on the PCS formulary. PCS provides a variety of other PBM services, including claims processing, drug utilization review, pharmacy network administration, and related services. PCS negotiates with pharmaceutical manufacturers, including Lilly, concerning placement on the PCS formulary, rebates, discounts, prices to be paid for pharmaceutical products purchased pursuant to pharmacy benefit plans managed by PCS, and other issues. PCS thereby influences the prices of pharmaceutical products and the availability of such products under the PCS pharmacy benefit plans. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Complaint further alleges that the Agreement and Plan of Merger contains a Memorandum of Understanding (``MOU'') in which Lilly and McKesson agreed to investigate closing Lilly's distribution centers and having McKesson handle physical distribution of Lilly products to wholesalers and possibly be the sole distributor of Lilly products. Implementation of this MOU would force wholesalers to deal with McKesson to obtain Lilly products or deny them access to Lilly products. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Complaint further alleges that the effects of the proposed acquisition of McKesson by Lilly may be substantially to lessen competition in the relevant markets in violation of section 7 of the Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 18, and section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 45, in the following ways, among others: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Products of manufacturers other than Lilly are likely to be foreclosed from the PCS formulary; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Reciprocal dealing, coordinated interaction, interdependent conduct, and tacit collusion among Lilly and other vertically integrated pharmaceutical companies will be enhanced; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) PCS will be eliminated as an independent negotiator of pharmaceutical prices with manufacturers; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Incentives of other manufacturers to develop innovative pharmaceuticals will be diminished; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / UK Company News: There was some corner of a foreign field . . . - Why the Plantations sector of the FT share service is coming to an end 'Nearly everyone who owned shares in the UK used to hold shares in some funny rubber company,' says Mr Edwin Hadsley-Chaplin, chairman of Rowe Evans Investments. His company is now one of the few still listed under the Plantations sector of the FT London share service. From next Tuesday plantations will be found in a subsector under Other Services and Businesses, marking the end of an era for what used to be one of the most important parts of the London market, with its own FT correspondent. The market capitalisation of all the plantations now is simply too small to make a separate index sector possible. It was a very different story early in the century, when the plantation sector experienced explosive growth as demand from the motor industry took off. By 1942 the Official Guide for Investors in Rubber Shares, issued by Mincing Lane Tea and Rubber Share Brokers' Association, listed hundreds of individual plantation companies. Among them was Bertam, still listed but now 35 per cent owned by Rowe Evans, and Sumatra Para Rubber Plantations, wholly owned by Rowe Evans. Both were registered in 1907. In the same year the Rubber Growers' Association was formed in London, and became the main source of all technical expertise and commercial practice in the world rubber industry. However, by the 1950s the number of companies was starting to dwindle. Only the London assets were reflected in the share price, not the value of the estates themselves, so that the companies were sitting ducks for a takeover. In 1957 Malaysian independence started to accelerate the process. New economic policies emerged in the 1970s, as Malaysia sought greater control over its resources. The big companies started to protect themselves. For example Sime Darby, the Malaysian conglomerate, put all its holdings into Consolidated Plantations, with a listing in Malaysia and a secondary listing in London. However, plans are afoot to take it back into the main group, which would take another company off the London list. Other companies amalgamated to keep the predators at bay, among them the plantations that went to form Highlands &amp; Lowlands under Mr Thomas Barlow. Highlands is also still listed in Malaysia with a secondary London listing, as is Kuala Lumpur Kepong. Mr Hadsley-Chaplin sums up the process as threefold - cheap acquisitions, amalgamation and Malaysianisation. He attributes his own company's survival to 'various quirks,' among which he lists its relatively small size. The company was founded in 1870 by Mathew Pennyfather Evans who had tea interests in Ceylon. By the time Mr Hadsley-Chaplin joined in 1947 it was a secretarial and agency company, operating like a partnership. Gradually a portfolio of shares was built in the companies it was acting for, so that the company became bigger as an investment and estate holding company. It was turned into a listed company about 10 years ago. Rowe Evans is now operating plantations in Indonesia and investing in Malaysia and Australia. Bertam not only operates plantations, but has branched into property development in Malaysia and investment in Indonesia. The only completely new plantation company to come to the market in recent times has been Anglo-Eastern, which was floated in 1985 in order to raise money to finance its 6,000-hectare Tasik plantation in Indonesia. However, Chillington, the conglomerate with interests in plantations, has sold most of its 49.2 per cent stake to Genton of Hong Kong, further illustrating the drift away from London. Anglo's history reflects the age-old problem with plantation investment  - the long lead time before crops start to produce cash. The initial investment is also high. Tasik alone has 250 miles of roads. Nevertheless, Mr Rollo Barnes, Anglo's executive director, says his company is thinking of developing another plantation. But it will think carefully about how to do it without pulling the current operation down. 'The average institutional investor does not want to know as there is no return for nine years,' he says. But he believes the pension funds should be interested. 'They should take a longer term view.' Tasik mainly produces palm oil, which is very price volatile, ranging between Dollars 1,000 a tonne in 1984 and Dollars 200 in 1986. However, an investment is as well underwritten as it ever was by the value of the land. The estate cost Dollars 20m, complete with crushing mill, equivalent to Dollars 3,000 a hectare, but Mr Barnes believes it could be sold for between Dollars 5,000 and Dollars 6,000 a hectare. Other UK companies with strong interests in palm oil and other commodities include Harrisons &amp; Crosfield and REA Holdings, whose initials denote its origins in a rubber estate agency early this century. It is now listed under Business Services. Last year REA started a 12-year project to create a palm oil plantation of 50,000 hectares (or 150 sq miles) but is aiming to raise the Pounds 10m that will be needed in three or four years time in Jakarta. Harrisons &amp; Crosfield, first registered in 1908 as a rubber company and now listed under Conglomerates, sold its 30 per cent stake in Golden Hope, another Malaysian company with a secondary London listing, in 1989, but has retained extensive interests in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. Williamson Tea Holdings is an unusual survivor and remains very much the old type of family plantation company. Although it has only been listed since 1964 it dates back to 1868, when it was founded by the great grandfather of Mr Philip Magor, the managing director. From next week the company will be found under Food Manufacturers, where Unilever, owner of Brooke Bond and many plantations, and James Finlay, another large tea grower are already listed. However, Williamson claims to be the biggest private sector company in the world devoted to tea production, with 34,000 hectares under plantation - far more than Unilever. Mr Magor points out that after the war the end of colonialism and the rise of nationalism naturally led to a decline in UK investment in the sector. Williamson decided to stick to its business, however, and has made sure it has good and prosperous partners, particularly in India, to ensure its interests are well looked after. The group, 62 per cent held by George Williamson Holdings, has always been prudently managed, Mr Magor says. 'We have never been great borrowers, and we have maintained development from retained profits.' He agrees with Mr Barnes that plantations are long-term propositions for investors. 'Sometimes we do very well - but it's occasional. We might have one really good year in 10.' The UK's continued high consumption of tea has has ensured a strong British interest remains in the industry. Mr Magor estimates that Williamson, Unilever, James Finlay and Camellia (listed under Other Financial) account for 8 to 10 per cent of the world's tea production. Williamson this month completed moving two thirds of its staff to Newbury, Berkshire, again reflecting the retreat from the City, although the group is maintaining a London office. The London tea auction four years ago lost its own room at Sir John Lyon House in High Timber Street, where Williamson had its head office. The auction is now held at the London Chamber of Commerce. Meanwhile, the Tropical Growers Association, formerly the Rubber Growers Association, can no longer afford to remain in its Dickensian offices above a Chinese restaurant in Artillery Row, near Liverpool Street station. It still has 200 members in 20 countries controlling or managing 800,000 hectares and producing 2.26m tonnes of commodities annually - rubber, palm oil, coconut, cocoa, banana, coffee, tea and pepper. But the subscription income has fallen from Pounds 67,806 in 1990 to Pounds 54,600 last year, and it will probably move out of the City to cheaper premises in Barking, Essex, next year. While its removal could well mark the end of an era, there is no doubt that the UK still has a useful interest in plantations. Mr Hadsley-Chaplin, a former chairman of the association, says: 'It is an extremely sophisticated industry now. I don't think that is appreciated by UK institutional investors. 'But the basic seat is no longer London, which has lost out and lost interest.'</p>

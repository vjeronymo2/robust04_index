			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Dealers concerned at Zeneca outlook SUB-UNDERWRITERS of the Pounds 1.3bn rights issue by Zeneca, the pharmaceuticals division spun off from ICI, are concerned they will not be able to dispose of the shares profitably once the deal closes on June 21. Zeneca shares yesterday closed at 617p, down 3p, just 3 per cent above the 600p rights issue price and yielding roughly 5.5 per cent. The shares on Wednesday had traded as low as 609p. Institutions said that brokers to the Zeneca issue had told them the dip in the share price had reflected selling by US investors concerned about the effects of health care reform. There is also fear that if the Zeneca issue is seen to flop it could depress the stockmarket, affecting the sale of BT shares next month. The Zeneca rights issue has an added twist in that a syndicate of international banks was formed to sell the rights shares to new investors outside the UK. One observer said this 'recycling' element was meeting poor demand judging by low trading volumes in the nil-paid shares. Zeneca's brokers declined to comment. Mr John Mayo, finance director of Zeneca, said 'a U-shaped price pattern over a rights issue period is quite normal'. Sub-underwriters, the large British institutional investors, said ICI shareholders, entitled to purchase Zeneca shares at 600p in proportion to their ICI stake, are likely to decline to exercise that right if the shares fall below 605p. The shares had traded in the grey market as high as 700p before terms of the rights offering were announced. 'We are happy to take up our rights and we are happy to take up our underwriting if there is a stick. But we will not do both,' said one leading UK institution. 'We thought 600p was top of the range to begin with,' said one fund manager, adding his fund had wavered before agreeing to underwrite roughly 1.5 per cent of the issue, in line with its ICI stake. Several institutions, however, said the underlying prospects for the shares were far better than their current trading price implies. One fund manager, who said he had agreed to underwrite a position larger than his ICI holding, said: 'I hope the shareholders walk away at 600p. We think the shares are good value at that price.'</p>

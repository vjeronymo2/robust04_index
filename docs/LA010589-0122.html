			<p><P> January 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A study by the Boston University School of Medicine suggests that women under  the age of 45 who use oral contraceptives may be facing an increased risk of  breast cancer, a finding that contradicts earlier studies. The research, one of  several studies to be presented today at a hearing of the Food and Drug  Administration, found that women who used oral contraceptives had twice the  risk of breast cancer compared to women who have never used the pill. For women  who have used the pill for 10 years or more, the study found, the risk of  breast cancer was increased four times. The findings were based on a study of  407 women with breast cancer and a cancer-free control group of 424. Dr. Samuel  Shapiro, director of the Slone Epidemiology Unit at Boston University, said in  a news release the new study contradicts findings in earlier studies, which  indicated there was no association use of the pill and development of breast  cancer. Public Citizen's Health Research Group, a consumer organization, called  on the government to revise labeling of the pill in response to the studies.  </P></p>

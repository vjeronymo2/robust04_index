			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some commenters were concerned that permitting issuers and obligors to send any notices or information they wished would flood the repositories. Given the fact that event notices generally are short, it appears that the repositories would be able to handle the flow of notices. The Commission will, however, monitor developments in this area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some commenters expressed concern that the event described as ``matters affecting collateral'' was too broad. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 122 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In response to such observations, that reference has been revised to reflect more clearly the types of events relating to collateral that could affect the creditworthiness of the security being offered. For instance, the item was not intended to require disclosure in the event of a drop in revenues or receipts securing payment. Rather, as more clearly indicated in the revised amendments, it is intended to encompass the release, substitution, or sale of property securing repayment of the securities being offered. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 123 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 122 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See, e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Letter of ABA Business Law Section; Letter of ABA Urban Law Section; Letter of NABL; Letter of NCHFFA; Letter of New York State Housing Finance Agency; Letter of Orrick Herrington.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 123 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 15c2&hyph;12(b)(5)(i)(C)(10).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Commenters also questioned whether the event relating to adverse tax opinions or events affecting the tax-exempt status of the security would include events not specific to an issuer, such as tax law changes which may affect a multitude of issuances and which are broadly reported. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 124 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  They argued that there is no need for each issuer to make that disclosure, which may overwhelm the repositories. The amendments do not include a uniform requirement for notification of events having widespread impact that are widely reported. Frequently, individual issuer disclosure may not affect the total ``mix'' of information available to investors, for example where Congress amends tax rates or alternative minimum tax rules that could affect an investor's yield. On the other hand, it may not be clear, absent individual disclosure, which classes of outstanding securities are affected by the general events, for example, where the tax law change affects a particular type of municipal security or financing structure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 124 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See, e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Letter of ABA Urban Law Section; Letter of Kutak Rock; Letter of Orrick Herrington.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It is possible that an ``event'' affecting the tax-exempt status of the security may include the commencement of litigation and other legal proceedings, including an audit by the Internal Revenue Service, when an issuer determines, based on the status of the proceedings and their likely impact on holders of the municipal securities, among other things, that such events may be material to investors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters expressed concern that the party providing the undertaking may not have knowledge of the occurrence of events affecting other parties that might be called for by the provisions of the rule. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 125 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This concern should be addressed by the revised approach of enabling the parties to the transaction to determine who will provide the undertakings. For example, in the conduit context, the covenant could be provided by the person that is committed by contract or other arrangement to support payment of debt service, rather than the conduit issuer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 125 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See, e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Letter of First Southwest Company; Letter of New York Dormitory Authority; Letter of the Treasurer of the State of North Carolina; Letter of City of Pullman, Washington.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The timing for providing the notification has not been changed from the Proposed Amendments, which required that the notice be provided on a ``timely'' basis. The amendments do not establish a specific time frame as ``timely,'' because of the wide variety of events and issuer circumstances. In general, this determination must take into consideration the time needed to discover the occurrence of the event, assess its materiality, and prepare and disseminate the notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A new paragraph has been added to the amendments <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 126 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  that would require a Participating Underwriter to reasonably determine that the undertaking includes an agreement to notify the appropriate repository if the annual financial information is not provided in the stated time frame.

Location of Undertaking in a Written Agreement or Contract  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Proposed Amendments called for the undertaking to be contained in a written agreement or contract for the benefit of holders of municipal securities. Commenters provided a variety of views as to where the undertakings should be memorialized, who should be parties to such undertakings, and the need for flexibility to modify undertakings in the future. Commenters suggested, for instance, that the undertakings could be included in the trust indenture, bond resolution, ordinance, or other legislation, a separate written agreement, or the underwriting agreement or bond purchase agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed in the Proposing Release, many offerings of municipal securities are issued pursuant to a trust indenture setting out the covenants of the issuer for the benefit of the holders of the municipal securities. If there is no trust indenture as part of an offering, as is the case with general obligation and certain other types of bonds, there may be a bond resolution, ordinance, or other legislation. Most commenters addressing this issue considered the trust indenture, bond resolution, ordinance, or other legislation to be appropriate for undertakings to provide secondary market disclosure, because they would create a direct obligation by issuers to bondholders. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 128 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Commenters also suggested the use of a separate written agreement between the issuer and the trustee as an appropriate method of memorializing undertakings. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 129 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 128 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See, e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Letter of Merrill Lynch. Certain commenters considered that undertakings in a trust indenture could prove inflexible, as well as difficult to modify if they became inappropriate in the future.

These commenters noted that such agreements provide flexibility for the future modification of the type, timing, or presentation of secondary market disclosure, as well as remedies in the event of a breach of the agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters suggested that the inclusion of the undertakings in an underwriting agreement or bond purchase agreement would be sufficient for purposes of Rule 15c2&hyph;12, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 130 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  though another commenter suggested that a promise running to the benefit of the underwriter, whether in a bond purchase agreement or in a separate agreement, would be enforceable by existing and future bondholders only on the basis of a third party beneficiary theory, the availability of which may vary from state to state. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 131 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 130 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Letter of Mudge Rose.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 131 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Letter of Morgan Stanley. Morgan Stanley also suggested that an underwriting agreement was an unsatisfactory vehicle for undertakings to provide secondary market disclosure because an underwriter of a specific bond issue should not be the recipient of a long-term contract of this type.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Letter of Morgan Stanley. Other commenters agreed that undertakings should be for the benefit of holders of municipal securities, and that there should be no requirement that undertakings be made for the benefit of Participating Underwriters.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See, e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , Letter of Merrill Lynch (noting that ``the holders of the securities have the greatest interest in enforcing the covenant to provide information and are in the best position to evaluate whether affirmative efforts to enforce the covenant should be undertaken'').  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

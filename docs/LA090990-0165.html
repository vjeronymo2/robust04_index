			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> FISHING NOTES / DAN STANTON;  </P> <P> YELLOWTAIL BITE SLOWS, BUT BONITO ACTION HEATS UP  </P> <P> Big bonito provided anglers aboard Redondo Sportfishing's fleet plenty of  action over the Labor Day weekend.  </P> <P> Spokesman Dan Armstrong said that schools of bait fish at rocky point helped  lure bonito into the area. The bonito weighed up to eight pounds.  </P> <P> Armstrong said the yellowtail bite slowed due to the heavy holiday traffic.  Bonito have accounted for the daily 10-fish limit.  </P> <P> L.A. Harbor Sportfishing's Shogun returned Monday from a two-day albacore trip.  Only 10 albacore were landed along with 15 skipjack and four dorado. Steve Oba  of West Los Angeles won the jackpot with his 20-pound albacore.  </P> <P> Debra Johnson of Torrance caught a 22-pound yellowtail and lost one of the  jackpots to a dorado.  </P> <P> The half-day boat Matt Walsh from L.A. Harbor Sportfishing was fishing outside  the horseshoe kelp area when a marlin jumped near the stern of the 65-foot  sportfisher. Felix Cowall of San Pedro had a small mackerel on his hook and  made a cast toward the area where the marlin had jumped.  </P> <P> Cowall had a strike and a marlin peeled all his 30-pound test line. Capt. Ray  Duane moved the boat with fighting fish.  </P> <P> Cowall was unable to gain any line, and after 15 minutes, his line snapped.  Duane estimated the fish to be in excess of 100 pounds.  </P> <P> Giant squid have invaded an area three miles out from Point Fermin. The live  bait boat Chovey Clipper, which supplies anchovies to the South Bay  Sportfishing fleet, was preparing to make a set for bait when giant squid came  up to the boat's floodlights.  </P> <P> Captain Bill Verner and his crew were able to scoop up four squid, which were  placed in the bait well.  </P> <P> A call was made to Larry Fukuhara at the Cabrillo Museum who had the squid  transferred to the museum's holding tanks. Fukuhara said that one squid on  display is 15 pounds and 14 1/2 feet long.  </P> <P> Information: Cabrillo Museum (213) 548-7562  </P> <P> Benny Marsh of Wilmington was fishing for bonito from his 20-foot skiff near  Portugese Bend and snagged a giant squid. He said it was about eight-feet long  and weighed 11 pounds.  </P> <P> Eleven marlin were weighed in during the weekend at Avalon's scale. Brian Rapf,  7, of Malibu caught his first marlin and it took him only 25 minutes to land  it. It weighed 139 pounds.  </P> <P> South Bay Catches -- Jim Kinsinger of San Pedro, fishing aboard the Shogun on a  tuna trip, caught the whopper of the week, a 48-pound bluefin tuna.  </P> <P> Scott Rubinson of Long Beach, fishing off Catalina aboard the Toronado, caught  a 30-pound yellowtail.  </P> <P> Angelo Torres of Torrance, fishing aboard the Outerlimits, caught a 26-pound  yellowtail.  </P> <P> Tom Moon of Santa Monica, fishing aboard the Aquaris, caught a 25-pound white  sea bass.  </P> <P> Neal Jenstrom of Redondo Beach, fishing at horseshoe kelp aboard the Victory,  caught a 22-pound yellowtail.  </P> <P> Patrick Garrett of Redondo Beach, fishing aboard the City of Redondo, caught an  18-pound halibut.  </P> <P> Fish Reports -- There are schools of bullet tuna moving into local waters.

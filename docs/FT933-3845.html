			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Engineers must take real control of profession if their lot is to change Sir, While I am thrilled the director general of the Engineering Council (Letters, September 6) considers engineering to be an 'attractive, stimulating and rewarding option', I can give several reasons why it is not. First, if he regards an average salary of Pounds 31,768, or the statistic that 8 per cent earned more than Pounds 50,000 a year, satisfactory, he is sadly mistaken. He most sincerely would feel so if he tried to raise a family in south-east England on that salary level. Although still young for a chartered engineer, I already earn more than twice the average for an engineer of any age outside the profession in a non-City, non-selling role. Second, the proportion of engineers recommending engineering as a career is irrelevant. Engineers have always recommended engineering as a profession. They are obliged to. They should have been asked how many of their children, who were academically capable, have chosen engineering as a profession. I suspect a very different response would have been obtained. Third, any profession promoting itself towards women has, by inference, the intention of becoming a low-paid one (sorry ladies, but as an ex-engineer I am being realistic). Fourth, if engineering is that good, why does one top UK business school still limit the number of civil engineers, most of whom are looking for an exit route, on its MBA course? Not until the supply and demand of engineers is controlled by the profession (and taken out of the hands of academics), and the profession decides to run itself like a profession rather than an amateur cricket club, and engineers get involved in the commercial aspects of their businesses, will the lot of engineers change.

			<p><P> September 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO OK ON RAIDERS BID  </P> <P> The Sacramento City Council voted unanimously to provide $50 million in public  money to entice the Los Angeles Raiders to the state capital. The money would  serve as a "franchise fee" to be paid to the Raiders, with the funds coming  from a bond issue that would be repaid over 22 years. The Sacramento County  Board of Supervisors, which also is involved in the public funding proposal, is  scheduled to vote on the matter today. Raiders General Manager Al Davis has  expressed unhappiness with the Los Angeles Coliseum and has threatened to move  his team to another city.  </P></p>

			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / MP's bill for right of appeal over bail DECISIONS by magistrates to grant bail in spite of objections by the prosecution will be subject to appeal under the terms of a private member's bill approved by the Commons yesterday, Ivor Owen writes. Mr David Maclean, home office minister, envisaged that new powers in the bail amendment bill would be used in rare cases where there was a serious public interest and good reason to suppose that the defendant would abscond. MPs accepted amendments made by the House of Lords restricting the right to appeal to the director of public prosecutions or other lawyers designated by the home secretary. Mr Maclean said 10 per cent of the 481,000 people granted bail in 1991 committed further offences before returning to the court. There was a hard core of offenders, including burglars and car thieves, who did not respect the courts and needed to be taught a lesson.</p>

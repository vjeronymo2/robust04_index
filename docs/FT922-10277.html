			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Technology: Citibanker for EBRD David Hexter is moving after 20 years at Citibank to head up and build the financial institutions group of the merchant banking side of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. An experienced commercial banker, he already knows eastern Europe from Citi. Since 1988 he has been divisional executive for the US bank's central and Eastern European operations, where his role included overseeing the establishment of two wholly owned subsidiaries, in Czechoslovakia and in Poland, last year. Citi, one of the foreign banking pioneers in the region, has also had a joint venture with the National Bank of Hungary in Budapest since 1985. Hexter, 43, is attracted to the EBRD job 'because the brief is a much broader and more difficult one'. He describes the mandate as catalysing the growth of private sector financial institutions in the former eastern bloc. This will entail a combination of direct equity investment from the EBRD, sometimes in tandem with foreign shareholders, as well as a raft of technical assistance to existing, mostly state-owned local entities, along the path towards privatisation.</p>

			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Survey of Computer Networking (3): Buzzwords in brief - From Ace and ATM to Lans, Mans and Vans / Although networking has vital implications for the business world, the technology is often obscured by technical jargon and buzzwords. Here, for the non-technical reader, Michael Wiltshire offers some simplified definitions Access control method: the main distinguishing feature between different local area network (Lan) technologies. ACE: advanced computing environment - a standard sponsored by a consortium of 22 vendors, including DEC, Microsoft and Compaq. ASCII: American Standard Code for Information Interchange. ASCII is the standard method of identifying characters, numerals and punctuation marks. ATM technology: asynchronous transfer mode, developed in France in the mid-1980s, is a breakthrough in communication technology with the potential to support transmission of combined data, voice and video at up to 45 megabits a second. ATM opens the door to many new network applications. Baud: a measure of signal changes per second in a device such as a modem. Backbone: generic term for a Lan or Wan connections 'trunk' between sub-networks across an enterprise. Subnetworks are connected to the backbone via bridges and/or routers. Bandwidth: the range of signal frequencies that can be carried on a communications channel. Bit: a binary unit of information that can have two values, 0 or 1. The word 'bit' is a contraction of binary digit. Block: a collection of transmitted data. Broadband: a term with a number of meanings - it was coined originally to describe a channel with more bandwidth than a standard voice grade channel, usually a 48kHz link, equal to 12 voice-grade channels. Such channels are gradually being superseded by digital circuits. Broadcast: when a user sends a message from one terminal to others on the network. CCITT: an international body, made up of telephone companies and other IT players, responsible for setting global communication standards. Client-server technology: the most widespread example of network computing: moves information processing to where it is most economical, fast and useful; divides computer systems into front-end 'client' workstations and back-end 'server' processes. CTI: computer-telephony integration - also known as computer-supported telephony. Data compression: a key topic for network managers as multimedia, video, document imaging and other technologies emerge. Domains: a Microsoft inspired network structure which separates large networks into smaller, more manageble segments. A domain can be made up of multipler servers and thousands of workstations. DBMS: database management system - a software system to manage data. DCE: data communications equipment, the hardware that provides connection to the network; DTE stands for data terminal equipment on a network, eg computers, printers and plotters. Digital signature: an encryption method to validate an electronic message. Distributed database: data located at multiple sites. Digital signal: this has only two values, normally 0 and 1, during transmission, as opposed to analogue signals whose values vary all the time. Dynamic routing: a way of sending messages across a network - if a line fails or is overloaded, the system will automatically re-route the message. Packet switching operates on this principle, with the system always poised to react to ever-changing conditions. EDI: electronic data interchange for business data such as purchase orders and invoices between companies. Electronic mail: sending and receiving messages and text-based information between computers; the most common application on networks. Ethernet: one of the oldest Lan technologies, developed by Xerox, Intel and DEC to run over coaxial cable; highly successful and still popular. File server: a computer attached to a Lan, usually running on a network operating system (Nos). Frames: a segment of data sent over a network medium using a cable or laser. The frame size is dependent on the protocols and services used. Frame relay: a data communication method for wide area networks, slowly replacing X25 - an X series standard, specifying the interface between computers and packet switched networks. Groupware: network software that defines applications used by a group of people. See page five. GUI: a graphical user interface to enable computer users to easily select a 'menu item' by using a 'mouse' to click on to a graphic icon. Hub: the centre of a star topology network or cabling system. Interoperability: the ability of applications on two computer systems to exchange information so that they can understand each other. ISDN: the slow-to-emerge integrated services digital network covering a range of voice, data and image services. Internet: the most expansive network of computer networks in the world, with 25m users - see article on facing page. ISO: International Standards Organisation, based in Geneva; responsible for many data communication standards, the best-known being the seven-layer Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. Lan: a local area network - in its simplest form, a cabling system. Installing a private cabling system (to which computers can be connected) and by using agreed proceedures (protocols), communications between all stations is possible. Man: metropolitan area network; usually high speed fibre-optic systems. Modems: short for modulators/demodulators; devices for connecting computers to public switched telephone networks (PSTN). Multimedia: brings voice, video and graphics to the network in the form of large files, requiring high disc storage space; plus large amounts of bandwidth during transmission. NetWare: Lan networking products including an operating system developed by Novell that holds a large market share of the Lan server sector. Novell claims to have 40m clients on its networks. Network audit trail: a continuous record of a network's activity. Network management: 'A term used to cover a multitude of sins,' says David Palmer-Stevens, author of the Guide to Local Area Networking.* 'As yet, there are few complete solutions available - a patchwork of network management systems cover a variety of areas . . . basically, vendors' systems fall into one of two camps, concerned with either physical (hardware) elements or the logical side of the network - the control and management of inter-process communication.' OME: an open messaging environment. Object-oriented technology: reusable software programming that simplifies development of applications. OS/2: cornerstone of IBM's client-server strategy for desktop computer systems. OSI model: a seven-layer model developed by the International Standards Organisation, ISO, specifying how computers should communicate over a network. PowerPC: microprocessor architecture developed by Motorola, in conjunction with IBM and Apple Computers. PDNS: public data networks. Packet: a group of bytes, sent over a link. Packet switching: a method of switching data in a network where individual packets of set size and format are accepted by the network and delivered to their destinations. With various companies sharing a network, the packet option can be a cost-saving method of communicating data. TCP/IP: suite of protocols developed by the US Department of Defense, since adopted as an international standard, particularly for networks of interconnected Ethernet Lans. SNA: Systems Network Architecture, introduced by IBM, the world's first network architecture. Token ring network: the standard of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers. Unix: a multi-user operating system that supports networking and distributed file systems. Vans: value added network services - a network that provides specialised facilities beyond the normal carrier service by adding computer-control and communications. Wan: a wide area network, covering a larger area than a local area network, and including telecom links. Examples include packet switched networks, PDNs and Vans. X series: recommendations specified by CCITT governing the attachment of terminals and computers to a data network.

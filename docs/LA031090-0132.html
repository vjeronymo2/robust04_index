			<p><P> March 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> In some editions of Saturday View last week, part of the directions in the Day  Hike column were omitted.  </P> <P> The correct directions are:  </P> <P> The Hike: From the end of Mel Canyon Road, follow the unsigned footpath up the  brushy slope. The trail briefly joins a road and continues ascending to a fire  department helipad.  </P> <P> Continue on the trail, a short way past the helipad to an unsigned junction,  where the trail joins Van Tassel Fire Road. You'll hike around a locked gate  and begin some steep switchbacks. The dirt road climbs to a ridgeline and takes  you past big cone spruce, which frame views of San Gabriel peaks. Enjoy the  panorama from 3,720 Mt. Bliss; return same way.  </P></p>

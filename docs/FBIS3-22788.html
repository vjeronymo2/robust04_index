Zhukeyev told a news conference in Almaty the report was  "instigated by forces wishing to introduce additional  difficulties in the beginning bilateral negotiations on nuclear  arms and a search for mutually acceptable decisions on an equal  basis." [sentence as received]    "It seems the forces are dissatisfied with the Kazakh  suspension of withdrawal of intercontinental ballistic missiles  that has begun on Kazakh goodwill. A total of 12 missiles have  been withdrawn. Now the work is stopped because of the unsettled  problem of compensation for highly-enriched uranium half of  which was extracted in Kazakhstan," said the official.    The report was published on the eve of a U.S. visit of  Kazakh  President Nursultan Nazarbayev. This gives grounds to say the  certain forces hope for a possibility of additional  international pressure on Kazakhstan in the sphere of nuclear  arms. "However, the problem can be settled only through  civilized negotiations with due account of interests of all  sides. Kazakhstan will not abandon its sovereign rights and  interests," said Zhukeyev.    The Kazakh stand was taken with understanding by Russian  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev during his recent stay in Almaty.    As for the IZVESTIYA's concern over the danger-prone  situation in nuclear arms storage allegedly created through the  fault of Kazakhstan, the state adviser said "nuclear arms are  completely safe and well-controlled. Kazakhstan has never  hampered the delivery of spares, instruments and equipment for  repairs and warranty service of nuclear warheads in contrast to  the report's claims. It is also not interested in deteriorated  position of Russian servicemen".    "We have repeatedly offered the Russian side to begin  negotiations and settle all problems on a mutually acceptable  basis. Prime Minister Sergey Tereshchenko timely responded to a  letter of his Russian counterpart Viktor Chernomyrdin on the  problem," stressed Zhukeyev. In his words, "the sides can  achieve progress on the issue only with due account of their  interests".</p>

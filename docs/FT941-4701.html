			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Stress on jobless takes heavy toll Unemployed people are 75 per cent more likely to experience a marriage break-up than those in work, says the most comprehensive survey of employment and joblessness in Britain. The four-year study, based on 6,000 individuals in six towns, found that in spite of experiencing multiple deprivations the unemployed are not becoming a culturally distinct 'underclass'. It also found that they are flexible in the work they are prepared to undertake and have only modest pay expectations. Almost all unemployed individuals are considerably worse off on benefits than in work - but married women are more likely to give up work when husbands become unemployed because of benefits rules. The survey covered Aberdeen, Coventry, Kirkcaldy, Northampton, Rochdale and Swindon. It is part of the Social Change and Economic Life Initiative funded by the Economic and Social Research Council. It is published today in the book Social Change and the Experience of Unemployment (Oxford University Press). Average labour costs in manufacturing are lower in the UK than southern Italy, one of the poorest regions of the European Union, says a report published by the Low Pay Unit yesterday. But the research group says the UK's success in creating jobs has been much less than in countries with higher levels of employment and social protection.</p>

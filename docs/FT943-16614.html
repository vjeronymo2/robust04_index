			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Baked-bean contender launched Sir Alistair Grant, group chairman of Safeway, is said to be passionate about it. He and his colleagues believe it can make a significant contribution to cutting Britain's food-trade deficit. The humble baked bean does not normally elicit such excitement but a new, home-grown variety has captured the imagination of the food industry, farmers and the Ministry of Agriculture. Such beans are normally imported from North America. The public will have its first chance to taste the British contender at the Royal Show, England's biggest agricultural event, which opens today at Stoneleigh in Warwickshire. The appropriately named Albion variety of the navy bean - the raw material for baked beans in tomato sauce - is being launched by Safeway, which hopes to use it in its own-label product as part of its policy of import substitution. Baked beans were first imported into Britain by the Pittsburgh-based company HJ Heinz at the turn of the century and sold at Fortnum &amp; Mason as a delicacy. They became a cheap and popular staple food once Heinz started to manufacture in the UK in 1928. Britons now consume 900m cans a year, or about 16 cans per head, with sales totalling Pounds 230m. To meet this huge demand the UK has to import 85,000 tonnes of navy beans from the US and Canada at a cost of about Pounds 40m. Recent trials at Cambridge University have shown that Albion and other new varieties can survive cold, wet English summers and stand up to comparison with their North American rivals. Mr Geoffrey Gent, director of the Processors and Growers Research Organisation, a group of farmers and food companies sponsoring the trials, said: 'Last year was a critical testing time for the new generation of beans. They developed well, maintaining a high level of quality despite a summer of poor weather. 'We believe there is potential for the UK to compete internationally for navy bean production.' The project's supporters are campaigning for financial support from the European Union under the Common Agricultural Policy. The value of the basic crop is higher than that of comparable peas and field beans, but it is uneconomical for farmers to grow because it does not qualify for subsidies of Pounds 365 a hectare.</p>

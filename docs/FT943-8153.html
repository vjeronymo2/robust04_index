			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Markets Report: Dollar in narrow range The dollar traded in a narrow range yesterday after Tuesday's 50 basis-point rise in US short-term interest rates, writes Philip Gawith. The market's response was more encouraging than after the previous three rate rises, where the dollar fell sharply. But investors remain wary of the US currency, having paid for their bullishness earlier in the year. It closed in London at DM1.5603, compared to DM1.5480 before the rate rise. Against the yen it finished at Y100.26 from Y100.425. In New York the dollar ended lower at DM1.5515 and Y100.135. Market attention quickly shifted to the Bundesbank council meeting today, the first after the summer recess. In a Reuters poll of 20 analysts, 85 per cent said they did not expect a cut in official German rates. A possibility remains that the Bundesbank will announce a return to a variable rate repo, which could herald a gradual fall in rates. Some observers, however, believe that the central bank may set another fixed rate repo, to avoid the possibility of rates rising under the variable option. The other main development was in the UK, where better than expected inflation and earnings figures boosted financial markets. Short sterling rose sharply, but the pound remained little changed as the fortunes of the D-Mark and the dollar continued to determine its progress. The trade weighted sterling index closed unchanged at 78.8. The Australian dollar was slightly weaker at Dollars 0.7402 from Dollars 0.7418 after the Reserve Bank followed the US Fed's lead and raised interest rates by 75 basis points to 5.5 per cent. The relative improvement in the dollar's performance, post the rate rise, can probably be attributed to the firmer tone of the US bond market. 'Previously the bond market had always felt that maybe there was more to come in terms of rate increases. Now there is a sense that maybe enough has been done,' said Mr Adrian Cunningham, senior currency economist at UBS in London. He warned, though, that there was a risk of further speculation if the Bundesbank failed today to offer the prospect of lower rates. This, said Mr Cunningham, might prompt a flow of funds from peripheral European currencies into the D-Mark, which would put downward pressure on the dollar. Mr David Cocker, currency analyst at Chemical Bank in London, noted that overnight to one week money rates in the US had now crept above those in Germany. 'For the first time, then, a trader in the interbank market will have an incentive to hold dollars rather than D-Marks.' He said three other factors would probably have to be met in order for the dollar to make a sustained recovery. First, there would need to be a clear resolution of the US-Japan trade dispute. Second, there would need to be a sense that US rates were close to their peak for a while, so that the bond market could enjoy a significant rally. Finally, the US presidency required increased credibility, 'something that seems further away than ever'. Mr Cocker noted that sentiment remained fragile, and said that a poor inflation number in the next month would renew fears that the Fed was 'behind the curve' in combatting rising prices, prompting further dollar sales. Events in the UK were dominated by the recovery in short sterling, prompted by the exceptional RPI figures. The underlying growth of retail prices by only 2.2 per cent in the year to July was the best performance in 27 years. The December contract saw 41,595 lots traded and ended 13 basis points firmer at 93.36 after a high for the day of 93.45. Economists were nearly unanimous in concluding that the latest data show that the economy does not need higher rates. But the futures market is still expecting rates to rise by about 135 basis points by the year-end. In Europe the D-Mark was slightly weaker against most currencies. The lira finished firmer at L1,018 from L1,023 and the French franc closed at FFr3.430 from FFr3.431. One exception was the Swedish krona, which was under severe pressure after a leak of the social democratic party's economic programme disappointed the bond market. The krona closed at SKr5.054 against the D-Mark, from SKr5.040, after slipping to a low of SKr5.0740. Mr Niels Christensen, currency analyst at Technical Data in London, commented: 'A lack of a move up in bonds and a strengthening of the D-Mark could easily be the scenario that triggers a move up towards SKr5.10.' But he added that there was a lot of negative news already built into the very low bond prices. In its daily operations the Bank of England provided UK money markets with Pounds 305m late assistance. Earlier it had provided Pounds 70m assistance at established rates, compared to a forecast shortage of Pounds 400m. Overnight money traded between 4 1/4 and 6 1/2 per cent. In Germany, call money rates eased to 4.80/90 per cent, from 4.85/95 per cent, ahead of the Bundesbank meeting.</p>

			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FINDING A RHYTHM;  </P> <P> CRESCENTA VALLEY'S SHANE COWSILL GETS BACK INTO SWING OF THINGS IN LAS VEGAS  </P> <P> Maybe Tony Zarrillo should be humming the strains of "Viva Las Vegas."  </P> <P> Viva something, at least. Because until last week, the Crescenta Valley High  baseball coach figured he had about as much chance of finding his offense as he  did of finding Elvis Presley.  </P> <P> Part of the problem was Shane Cowsill. A junior who pitches and plays first  base for the Falcons, Cowsill hit .390 last season and was named to The Times'  All-Glendale team. But he got off to a painfully slow start this season, and  when Crescenta Valley left for last week's Chaparral tournament in Las Vegas,  Cowsill had just three hits in seven games.  </P> <P> But the hot desert air went a long way toward cracking Cowsill's slump.  </P> <P> Granted, three hits in a tournament is not always cause for jubilation, but  Zarrillo saw Cowsill making large strides in confidence.  </P> <P> "There was a noticeable change," Zarrillo said. "He looked more comfortable at  the plate."  </P> <P> Shane isn't the first Cowsill to find comfort in Las Vegas. His father, Paul,  was a member of the "The Cowsills," a popular bubble-gum rock band in the late  1960's. The group, composed of eight members of the Cowsill family, was the  true-life basis for "The Partridge Family" television show and had several hits  including "Hair," and "The Rain, The Park, and Other Things."  </P> <P> The Cowsills, under contract with the Flamingo Hotel, would spend three months  a year in Las Vegas during their heyday.  </P> <P> Fans remember.  </P> <P> At one point during a tournament game, Cowsill noticed the first-base umpire  gawking at the back of his jersey.  </P> <P> "In the middle of a pitch he goes, 'Are you related to the singing Cowsills?' "  Cowsill said. "I said, 'Paul's my dad.' And he says, 'Oh, wow! Which one is  he?' He's looking up into the stands and I'm thinking, 'Hey, get in the game,  bud.' "  </P> <P> Paul Cowsill maintains fond memories of the city.  </P> <P> "We had a good time," he said. "Everything was cool when we were playing  Vegas."  </P> <P> Everything was cold when Shane was playing L. A.  </P> <P> Cowsill reasons the slump was caused by self-imposed pressure for an encore  season.  </P> <P> "I thought I had to do it all by myself," he said. "And when I think I have to  do everything by myself, I press and tense up."  </P> <P> Zarrillo, who has talked with Cowsill at length in an attempt to relieve the  tension, says he might have put too much emphasis on the junior's role, which  might be expected since Cowsill's 39 runs batted in last season ranked third in  the Southern Section 4-A division.  </P> <P> "Everyone associated with our program expects a great deal from him," Zarrillo  said. "I think he's learning a lesson. As he gets older and the competition  gets better, he realizes he has a role to play in the framework of the team.  </P> <P> "It's important that he understand his role but not that the success or failure  falls squarely upon his shoulders -- it certainly does not."  </P> <P> It seems as if anything short of a Volkswagen could rest comfortably on  Cowsill's shoulders, however. His 6-foot-3, 220-pound frame is  less-than-svelte.  </P> <P> Zarrillo says Cowsill will have to redistribute his bulk with a steady weight  program to be most effective. "He will make his mark as a good hitter and good  defensive first baseman," he said. "But he's never going to lead your team in  stolen bases."  </P> <P> Cowsill's size and soft hands made him a natural tight end on the football  team. Though 1988 was his first year of organized football, and a broken hand  abruptly ended his season, he was given serious All-Pacific League  consideration by the league's coaches.  </P> <P> "He can certainly play in college," Crescenta Valley football Coach Jim  Beckenhauer said. "His hands are as good as a wide receiver's."  </P> <P> Cowsill displayed those hands on an out pattern against South Pasadena. He  leaped above a pack of defenders and snagged a pass, and when he landed he was  popped soundly but held onto the ball. The play, Cowsill recollects, covered 25  yards.  </P> <P> "That's where I think he came of age," Beckenhauer said. "He took a tremendous  hit and made it look easy.  </P> <P> "Once he learns, he'll be a load because he's got that frame that can really  move some bodies."  </P> <P> In addition to football, Cowsill had a stint with the basketball team, but  decided not to play when the season began to impinge on baseball.  </P> <P> For Cowsill, all sports are second to baseball.  </P> <P> "Shane's got a plan in his head and he hasn't really veered from it yet," said  Paul, who now works as a free-lance contractor and coaches a Babe Ruth League  baseball team. "He's all baseball."  </P></p>

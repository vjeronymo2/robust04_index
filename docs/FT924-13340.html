			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / The Birmingham Summit: Kohl hopes event will help host - Germany wants to give a 'signal of confidence' GERMANY wants the summit to be, above all, a success for Mr John Major, Britain's prime minister, to strengthen his domestic political position, and to give 'a signal of confidence' to the rest of the European Community. Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who last night met Mr Major for dinner - an encounter described by the Bonn government spokesman afterwards as representing a 'positive signal' for relations - is adamant that there is no alternative to ratification of the Maastricht treaty on European union by all 12 member states. 'There is no fall-back position,' one senior German diplomat said. The chancellor is also angrily trying to halt the debate over whether an inner core of EC members should press ahead towards union regardless of the rest. 'This stupid discussion over a Europe of two or three speeds must be stopped,' said another official. 'It has no basis in fact. It was certainly never even mentioned in Paris at the discussions between the chancellor and President Francois Mitterrand.' What the chancellor wants, his advisers say, is a full-blooded statement of commitment to Maastricht, with enough political declarations to reassure Euro-sceptics in Britain, Denmark and Germany that the EC is not some 'bureaucratic leviathan'. They admit that the summit is not going to solve any of the EC's fundamental problems, and will not come up with a detailed definition of 'subsidiarity'  -the concept of maximum devolution of power to national, regional and local government. It will also do nothing to answer the fears of a large majority of Germans over the prospective replacement of the D-Mark with a single European currency. What it will do, they hope, is set enough clear guidelines so that the Edinburgh summit in December can solve the subsidiarity problem, and provide Denmark with the reassurance it needs to call a new referendum on the treaty. There is not going to be any independent German initiative on those issues, in spite of the government's recent memorandum on subsidiarity, because Bonn is determined that overall control should remain with the British presidency. Broadly the positions of Britain and Germany coincide. Mr Kohl has been emphasising increasingly the need for a 'citizen-friendly Europe', and for recognition that the EC has been trying to legislate on too many details of daily lives. 'It is not a criticism of the Commission. We are all guilty,' said one senior official. 'It is not a question of changing the balance of institutions, nor of turning the rudder 180 degrees. But we want to show we are not building up a great leviathan.' He admitted that defining subsidiarity was proving difficult, and causing divisions between large and small EC states: the former are happy to carry out more policies at national level, the latter want them enacted and financed jointly. The EC leaders are not going to do more than touch on the problems of the European and world currency markets: Germany has strongly resisted any more substantial debate. The British desire to have a debate on reform of the European monetary system was flatly rejected by Bonn as both unnecessary and unwise: it would simply cause new speculation in the money markets. According to the Bonn spokesman, Mr Kohl and Mr Major did not focus on monetary issues at their dinner. 'There will ne no currency debate tomorrow (Friday),' he said. The one potentially explosive issue will be the Gatt negotiations on trade liberalisation, in which Mr Mitterrand appears increasingly isolated in his determination to resist any further concessions to the US. Mr Kohl does not want to embarrass his closest European ally, but nevertheless, 'our position is that it would be an extraordinarily important signal for the world economy, to have a solution to the Gatt round', the official said. An agreement in Birmingham on the EC's stance at the Gatt negotiations would reinforce the improvement in confidence Mr Kohl hopes to achieve by a declaration on the Maastricht treaty. He is acutely aware of the need to revive growth not just in the world economy, but in Germany as well, where the slowdown threatens any hope of recovery in the east.</p>

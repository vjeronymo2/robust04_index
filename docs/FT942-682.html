			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: UK electricity All the regional electricity companies now have a clear idea of what Mr Stephen Littlechild, the industry regulator, has in mind for the forthcoming review of distribution prices. It is therefore difficult to interpret Norweb's continued assertion that it can deliver 6-8 per cent real dividend growth through to the end of the decade. The obvious conclusion is that the regulatory line has softened since the spring, when most profits forecasts were scaled back. It would be rash to push this argument too far. By promising that one-fifth of its earnings will come from unregulated business by the end of the decade, Norweb has shown touching faith in its ability to make money in areas such as retailing. Neither has the company said how fast dividend cover will be run down to keep the pay-out racing ahead. Seeboard was notably less gung-ho about the prospects yesterday. Even allowing for healthy scepticism about the prospects outside the regulated business, though, most Recs look well placed to cope with tougher price controls. Seeboard has promised to cut 250 jobs a year for the next three years, even though it is among the most efficient in the sector. The scope for cost savings at the least efficient companies can only be guessed at. A one-off 20 per cent cut in distribution prices of the type mooted in April would still hurt. But having underperformed a falling stock market by almost 10 per cent since then, the bad news may now be in the price.</p>

			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Isosceles Isosceles' bankers now face an acute dilemma; either they pay up and let the Gateway grocery chain live, or clam up and watch it die. With interest payments still rolling up at an alarming rate and trading conditions deteriorating by the day, the Isosceles buy-out vehicle desperately needs more money. The company is inexorably heading for its third refinancing in as many years. It is, of course, natural for bankers to spread bad debts over a long time to minimise one-off shocks, but inactive delay may be self-defeating. If the company were broken up now its assets might at best fetch only half the Pounds 1.2bn which the banks are still owed. On its present course they are likely to be worth still less two years down the line. The banks may yet decide that their best hope of recovering the shortfall lies in installing pragmatic management with enough cash to re-ignite growth. Although trading has been badly hit, Gateway still has a sound core which may make Pounds 110m operating profits this year. Some of the new formats Gateway has launched also seem worth backing. A flotation may be a pipe-dream but future sales of assets at better prices may yet provide an exit route. The banks will clearly worry about throwing good money after bad - especially as their original loans look increasingly like equity. With Gateway's main rivals opening 250 new superstores in the next three years, competitive attrition will hardly slacken. But the banks are already hurting; boldness may be the only way to save them from more bruises.</p>

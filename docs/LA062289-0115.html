			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> ENTREPRENEUR CASTS LOT WITH SPORTFISHING  </P> <P> Skipper Andy Volaski grew seasick watching Ventura Landing Sportfishing try to  stay afloat in a very competitive market.  </P> <P> Volaski, 54, had been operating fishing boats out of the landing for 17 years  and had worked for four different owners.  </P> <P> After the last owner went bankrupt and left Ventura without commercial fishing  for 2 1/2 months, Volaski decided to run the business himself.  </P> <P> "We've always had a good following," Volaski said. "I've been fishing in these  waters for a long time and I have a few favorite spots. I try not to let any of  my customers go home empty-handed."  </P> <P> Business, however, has been slow. Few people know about the landing because  there has been little advertising. In order to make a reservation, you have to  call Volaski at home because his boathouse is currently under construction.  </P> <P> "Until now, it's been a Mickey Mouse operation," Volaski said. "We should have  new facilities and new docks by the end of the week."  </P> <P> Volaski's boat is called the Sea Angler Sportfisher and leaves for  three-quarter-day runs every morning except Wednesday from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m.  There is also twilight fishing on Wednesday through Saturday from 5:30 to 10:30  p.m.  </P> <P> "We'll be switching to surface fishing from rock codding," Volaski said. "Right  now, we're getting some halibut, bass and barracuda. The fishing will really  get good as soon as the waters warm up."  </P> <P> The landing is located at 1500 Anchors Way in Ventura Harbor. For reservations:  805-646-3590.  </P> <P> Stroke of luck: Jeff Richards, a professional painter, has changes partners as  often as paint cans, but it hasn't affected his luck on the Ventura County  Grand Prix tour.  </P> <P> Richards has won two tournaments and twice reached the semifinals in five  events while competing in the Men's A doubles bracket.  </P> <P> He leads the division with 140 points. Phil Ranger, the former tennis pro at  Cabrillo Racquet Club, is second with 70.  </P> <P> Next stop on the tour is this weekend at the Oakridge Racquet Club Tournament  in Simi Valley.  </P> <P> Heading home: Chris Hantgin, former Ventura High basketball standout, is  transferring to Ventura College after attending Gonzaga University in Spokane,  Washington for one year.  </P> <P> Hantgin, a forward, red-shirted his freshman year with the Bulldogs and will  join the Pirates as a freshman.  </P> <P> Bayou Bound?: Ventura College pitcher Shane Espitia will visit Nicholls State  University in Thibodaux, La., this weekend before deciding where he will  continue his baseball career.  </P> <P> Espitia posted an 8-3 record and 2.86 earned-run average last season for the  Pirates.  </P> <P> Espitia is also considering Cal Lutheran, Azusa Pacific, Cal State Sacramento,  Sonoma State, and San Francisco State.  </P> <P> Tennis professionals appointed: Dave Dike of Santa Paula will become the new  professional at the Moranda Park in Port Hueneme. Dike formerly coached the  men's team at Cal State Dominguez Hills in Carson.  </P> <P> Dave McKinney, who recently moved from Kohler, Wis., has been appointed  director of tennis and head professional at Cabrillo Racquet Club in Camarillo.  </P> <P> Junior tennis: The Cabrillo Racquet will enter three teams in the State  Championships for junior team tennis on August 26 and 27 at the Sierra Club in  Fresno.  </P> <P> There will be six teams representing each Northern California and Southern  California in a competition known as the Gar Glenney Cup.  </P> <P> The Boys 15 and under team features Darren Potkey, who competed as a freshman  for Ventura high. The top two players on the boys 12 and under team are twins  Mike and Bob Bryan of Camarillo. The top player on the girls 12 and under team  is Jessica Improta of Camarillo.  </P> <P> These three teams qualified for the state tournament by winning the junior team  tennis playoffs June 10 and 11 at UCLA.  </P> <P> Junior team tennis has 255 teams from Bakersfield to San Diego with 1,800  youngsters participating.  </P></p>

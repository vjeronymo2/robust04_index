			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Manila to resume IMF talks THE PHILIPPINES has agreed with the International Monetary Fund to resume negotiations on a medium-term financing programme to support economic recovery, the government announced yesterday. The last of the decade-long series of short-term programmes for Manila ended in March and subsequent disagreements over revenue-enhancement measures brought discussions on a successor programme to a stalemate. The Philippines is looking to a three-year financing worth about Dollars 800m (Pounds 528m) that will help propel its economy towards double-digit growth towards the end of this decade.</p>

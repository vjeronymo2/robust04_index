			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special dispatch": "Zhu Rongji Meets Lo Hong-sui, Talks </F> About Strengthening Contacts Between the Central Authorities and  Hong Kong People"]    [Text] Beijing, 7 Apr -- A delegation of the Hong Kong  Business and Professional Federation today paid separate visits  to Zhu Rongji, member of the Political Bureau Standing Committee  and vice premier of the State Council; Qian Qichen, vice premier  of the State Council and minister of foreign affairs; and Wang  Zhaoguo, minister of united front work. The delegation also had  dinner with Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs  Office. During these meetings, they exchanged views on contacts  between the mainland and Hong Kong, on the retention of Hong  Kong civil servants, on the issuance of special administrative  region [SAR] passports, on Hong Kong real estate prices, and on  China's economic development and tax reform.    At a press conference tonight, Lo Hong-sui said he was happy  to have had the opportunity to hold detailed discussions with  the two vice premiers on some of Hong Kong's problems.    He said that delegation members suggested to the two leaders  that methods should be worked out to strengthen contacts between  the central authorities and Hong Kong people. They felt that on  many issues, the central government did not seem to fully  understand Hong Kong citizens' ideas or feelings, and that in  general, Hong Kong citizens cannot completely understand or  accept central government policies. Therefore they suggested  that the central government work out methods for improvement,  such as systematically explaining some important contents of the  Basic Law to Hong Kong citizens and responding to Hong Kong  Government policies and comments.    They expressed concern that the continued lack of contact  between the Chinese and British Governments would affect  economic development in Hong Kong and the Zhu Jiang delta, he  pointed out. He cited the following example: Hong Kong's Kwai  Chung container port basically will be saturated next year; if  the construction of a new port is delayed time and again, this  will affect the shipment of Hong Kong's export commodities,  apart from causing traffic congestion in the surrounding area.  On the other hand, Guangdong Province has started carrying out  large-scale infrastructural construction projects, which will  form a convergence with Hong Kong. If the two sides still lack  contacts, certain difficulties and obstacles will crop up.    Delegation member Chu You-ka said that Zhu Rongji briefed  them on the mainland's economic development, and that he  expressed satisfaction with the present situation. Concerning  foreign exchange, the renminbi exchange rates have remained  stable since July last year, and the foreign exchange reserve  has increased by more than $6 billion. In addition, money  injection has slowed down, which will help alleviate inflation.  The implementation of the revenue-sharing system, which started  early this year, also has yielded results, which are manifested  in increased central government revenue without a decrease in  local taxes. This is beneficial to reducing deficits in central  government revenue. The inflation rate, however, rose from 13  percent last year to 20 percent in the first quarter of this  year. This situation merits attention. What is gratifying is  that the increase in the people's income is higher than the  inflation rate. Zhu Rongji was confident that inflation would  fall in the months to come.    Lo Hong-sui pointed out that the delegation members had  expressed their concern to the two vice premiers and to Lu Ping  over the sentencing of MING PAO reporter Xi Yang, and had  expressed their hope that Chinese leaders would help resolve  this issue. These leaders said that they were in charge of  administrative institutions and did not participate in judicial  operations, so they were not familiar with the details of the  case, nor was it convenient for them to influence or meddle in  judicial operations. Lo Hong-sui said that after the delegation  had returned to Hong Kong, they would write a letter to the  relevant Chinese leaders to seek ways to resolve the case.</p>

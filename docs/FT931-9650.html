			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Technology: On the scent of a bestsmeller - Della Bradshaw discovers why synthetic perfumes are beginning to outperform their natural counterparts The dream of every perfumer is not fields of purple lavender nor hillsides covered in bright yellow mimosa - not even gardens full of sweet-smelling roses. It is the one synthetic chemical that will give that most elusive of products - the best-selling fragrance. For although a perfume may boast high notes of jasmine or undertones of musk, these days the vast majority of perfume oils are produced in a chemistry laboratory rather than a field. 'The trend is towards more synthetic components,' points out Terry Goodacre, senior perfumer at Drogoco, one of the dozen fragrance and flavour companies now employed by the top perfume houses to develop new perfumes. He acknowledges that naturally-derived oils 'always have the edge', because each fragrance oil can be made up of thousands of individual chemical components, each in minute proportions. But recent developments in synthesising oils that replicate natural flower fragrances, and the development of completely new chemical components, are beginning to rival - and even outperform - their natural counterparts. One big advantage of synthetic oils is that they are less expensive than their natural equivalents. Grasse, in the south of France, for example, provided many of the flowers for the perfume industry until tourism pushed up the price of land along the French coast and made large-scale flower cultivation uneconomical. It takes a tonne of jasmine flowers to produce just a few kilos of perfume oil. The price, quality and supply of synthetics can also be guaranteed. When frost hit the Californian orange crop in December 1991, for example, the price of natural orange oil soared. And until recently, perfumers have imported much of their oak moss and lavender from the former Yugoslavia and many of the resinous fragrances from Somalia. There are now fears that supplies from both these areas could be jeopardised. The art of the chemist is twofold. First, scientists have to formulate a chemical oil that is as near as possible to the natural source. Traditionally, that has been done by extracting the oil from the plant and then analysing it. But many of the latest high-priced perfumes have used fragrances derived by a new method known as 'head space analysis'. In this, rather than analysing the flower oil, scientists concentrate on the odour which emanates from the living flower before it is picked. This can be particularly useful with flowers such as daffodils, from which oil cannot be extracted. The volatile substances from the flower are vacuumed up over several hours or days. The sweet-smelling air is cooled to condense out the fragrant materials. These are analysed using traditional spectrometry and, if all goes according to plan, replicated. The difference between the analysis of a flower oil and the results of the vacuum method can be 'quite startling', says Goodacre. One reason for this is that when oils are extracted from flowers, many of the component chemicals are broken down, affecting the smell. Analytical techniques used to catalogue the volatile components of a natural oil have now become so sophisticated that they can identify those that appear in minute quantities - just a few parts per million. So chemists can go back to popular flowers - the rose is the obvious case - and synthesise these trace chemicals so that the artificial rose oil smells even more like that from the original flower. Second, and more excitingly, chemists are discovering new fragrant components. 'All the time we're looking for new smells, we're all striving for this new component,' says Tony Mills, chief perfumer with Bush Boake Allen, the fragrance and flavour company. 'With chemistry, we can come up with a whole new direction.' Few perfumers even dare to believe that they will concoct the second Chanel No 5 - a constant bestseller since it was introduced in 1923. What they hope for is a fragrance which other perfume houses will be forced to emulate. Failing that, they aspire to create a novel fragrance by experimenting with existing chemicals in innovative mixes. Typically, each perfume is a blend of 30 to 50 different oils, although a complex blend can contain up to 200 components. 'It's very exciting to build a winning fragrance around an ingredient that has been on the shelf all the time,' says Mills. On the BBA shelves there are up to 1,300 different chemicals. Once a perfume is created, the novel element can be used in the marketing. The Japanese cosmetics company, Shiseido, for example, heavily promotes its new perfume, Feminite du Bois, on its sultry ingredient, cedarwood. Industry experts reckon that in spite of the frequency of perfume launches in the past few years, truly innovative fragrances have been few and far between. In the late 1970s, for example, Ralph Lauren introduced Lauren, with its distinctive blackcurrant note. Other perfume houses followed with other fruity fragrances. Most recently, Aramis launched New West for Her, with its clean melon fragrance which other perfume houses are still trying to emulate. One reason, believes Astra West, fragrance evaluation manager with BBA, is that once a perfume reaches the market evaluation stage, consumers invariably opt for something comforting rather than something challenging. 'The familiar always wins,' says West. And with that in mind, few brand managers are prepared to stick their necks out in order to back a truly innovative product with the prospect of losing millions of pounds. 'There are very few Estee Lauders left in the world, who say that's the one I want,' adds West. Creating a new perfume is inevitably a complex process. 'It's a bit like in advertising,' says Goodacre. 'The client comes to us with a brief of what they want and we pitch for the business.' The brief could be something as general as a marketing strategy - the age of the potential wearer and lifestyle, say. Other briefs would be more complicated, identifying specific elements in the fragrance. One of the biggest problems is interpreting what the client wants. But a 'language of perfumery' has developed - with 'floral notes', 'green notes' and so on. 'One of the most misinterpreted words I've ever come across is the word 'fresh',' says West, citing the numerous different interpretations of the word. In spite of all the research involved in creating the vital combination of oils and aromas, as little as 15 per cent of a bottle of perfume is actually oil, says Peter McDougall, an analyst at BZW, the London securities house. The most plentiful component is alcohol - 55 per cent - followed by distilled water. In a bottle of eau de parfum the oil content can be as low as 8 per cent, and in eau de toilette as low as 4 per cent. And in terms of the cost of production, the ingredients in a bottle of perfume account for only 5 per cent of the total outlay, adds McDougall. The research and development costs a further 5 per cent, and there is the additional cost of the expensive equipment needed for the distillation process. But for those eager to buy their loved ones a bottle of the latest perfume for Valentine's Day on Sunday, it is sobering to remember that most of its cost is accounted for not by the fragrance but by sales and marketing activities, packaging, distribution, and, of course, the profit margin.</p>

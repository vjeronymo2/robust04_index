			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE: IS ROCK 'N' ROLL ON ITS LAST LEGS? OR JUST IN A SLUMP?  </P> <P> Guess what's practically disappeared from the Billboard Top 10 this week?  Here's a hint: Something that is such an elemental ingredient in the pop  experience that you never imagined it could disappear.  </P> <P> Would you believe . . . rock 'n' roll?  </P> <P> With AC/DC's "The Razor's Edge" at No. 9 this week, there's only one rock album  in the Top 10. In fact, it's been nearly 14 months since a rock group topped  the Billboard charts (when Motley Crue spent two weeks at No. 1 in October,  1989).  </P> <P> Look at it this way: In 1988, five rock groups had No. 1 albums (U2, Guns N'  Roses, Def Leppard, Bon Jovi and Van Halen). In 1989, it was just two (the Crue  and the Fine Young Cannibals). In 1990: zero.  </P> <P> What worries record industry execs even more is that Contemporary Hit Radio  (CHR), radio's key hitmaking format, has been ignoring rock too, focusing on  dance, rap and pop hits. (Just look at Radio &amp; Records' CHR chart, which  has only six bona-fide rock singles in the Top 35.)  </P> <P> Is rock simply in a slump? Has MTV ruined rock 'n' roll? Are rap stars like  Vanilla Ice and M.C. Hammer stealing away young fans? Or is putting together a  garage-rock group no longer a big part of the adolescent American dream? We  asked some industry experts for answers.  </P> <P> Bob Pfeiffer, A&amp;R exec at Epic Records: "The fundamental problem is that in  recent years liquor laws have changed and forced rock clubs to restrict  admissions to fans 21 and over. So club scenes are dead everywhere. That's hurt  young bands because it took away a big economic base of support. But more  importantly, the root experience of rock 'n' roll -- the excitement of turning  18 and going to see a live rock band -- is over. If you're 19 now, you're  either going to movies or watching MTV. By the time you're 21, that combination  of sex, drinking and rock 'n' roll isn't so vital anymore. Live rock just isn't  such an integral part of kids lives."  </P> <P> Hale Milgrim, president of Capitol Records: "There's no doubt that middle  America really got into rap music for the first time this year. When CHR  responded by playing a lot of it, it became a lot harder to find a new rock  band on the radio. Does that mean rock is dead? I don't think so. Maybe it  won't be as important to today's kids as it was to the generation that grew up  in the '60s. But I think it's just going through another evolutionary phase.  Growth isn't unhealthy, even if it isn't all positive. Who would want rock to  just stay the same?"  </P> <P> Bud Scoppa, vice president of artist development at Zoo Records: "You  definitely get the feeling that the field of play has diminished. With radio  looking elsewhere, there aren't many viable avenues of exposure for rock music.  The video monster has taken up so much of our revenue as an industry -- and  attracted so much attention from consumers -- that rock bands are aiming for  MTV stardom now. They're not out playing in smoky dives every night. And the  ones you do see, especially out here, aren't playing for the love of music.  They're trying to tailor their performances to get a record deal."  </P> <P> Carey Curelop, program director at KLOS-FM: "We're at a fork in the road with  CHR radio. The recent ratings show that people are burned out by the steady  diet of dance and rap hits. In the fall of 1989, Power 106 had a 6.2 share of  audience. This summer they fell to a 4.3. KIIS-FM was at 5.4 last fall. Now  they're at 4.9. There's been a similar downtrend across the country. I think  you're going to see radio broaden its playlists and make room for  guitar-oriented bands like the Black Crowes and Slaughter."  </P> <P> Ed Rosenblatt, president of Geffen Records: "Lack of support from CHR radio is  definitely a big factor -- it's totally turned its back on rock. We've sold a  million copies of our Black Crowes album with minimal CHR play. But there just  haven't been that many rock records in the marketplace. Look who hasn't put out  a record this year -- Guns N' Roses, Def Leppard, U2, Bruce Springsteen,  Aerosmith, Van Halen and a ton of other bands. Wait till next year."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Tamara Zamyatina, Yuriy Sizov, </F> and Nikolay Sorokin]    [Text] Kazan, 31 May (ITAR-TASS) -- Boris Yeltsin and  [Tatarstan's President] Mintimer Shaymiyev think that  implementation of the treaty between Russia and Tatarstan is a  most important task of bilateral relations, the presidents of  Russia and Tatarstan told journalists today immediately after  the meeting between the Russian delegation and the Tatarstan  leadership today in the Kazan kremlin.    The president of Russia said that his meetings with the  inhabitants of the capital of Tatarstan showed that the  political situation in the republic is returning to normal after  the conclusion of the bilateral treaty. Boris Yeltsin stressed  at the same time that the treaty should not become just a "piece  of paper". A bilateral commission has been set up to implement  the treaty. It will be headed on the Russian side by First  Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets and not by Sergey Shakhray  as was planned. "On the Tatarstan side, the commission will be  headed by the prime minister [Mukhammet Sabirov]," the president  of Russia said.    In Boris Yeltsin's opinion, Russia is now to move toward  decentralization on a country-wide scale. However, it is  inadvisable to apply the terms of the treaty between Russia and  Tatarstan to other subjects of the federation. "A separate  treaty should be signed with every republic, kray, and oblast, a  separate demarcation of powers should be envisioned. We will  move along that path but not so quickly that similar treaties  will be signed with other regions this year," the Russian  president said.    Replying to questions on the possibility of applying the  bilateral treaty with Tatarstan to the CIS, the leader of Russia  said that it is still too early to talk of that. In his opinion  this model must first be developed within the framework of  Russia.    Boris Yeltsin will leave Kazan for Moscow once the meeting  is  over.</p>

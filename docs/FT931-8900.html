			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / UK Company News: A revamped package is welcomed in the City  -The changing face of Bowater BOWATER'S acquisition of Specialty Coatings International was welcomed by the City yesterday and marks the final phase of the revamp of the group begun in 1987. The group has come to be seen as a model of how to run a business in a recession, and it says much for its standing that yesterday's rights issue - the second in less than a year - was greeted by an 8p rise in the shares to 493p. The new management which has transformed the company, headed by Mr Norman Ireland, for 20 years finance director of BTR, the industrial holding group, decided in 1987 to reduce its traditional interests in the paper and packaging sectors. It moved instead towards more sophisticated value-added products, offering bigger profit margins and growth potential. In 1987 it acquired Rexham Corporation, the US packaging group, and its portfolio of custom coating and laminates businesses. Two years later it purchased Release Technologies, the release films and papers manufacturer. Having studied the potential of these businesses, Bowater adopted a strategy in 1990 of developing a 'critical mass' in three areas: health care packaging, personal care packaging, and coated industrial films. The first two aims were largely achieved through the acquisition last March of DRG Packaging, which supplies speciality packaging to the food and healthcare markets, and Cope Allman, a cosmetics and pharmaceuticals packaging group. The purchases were funded largely by a Pounds 333.5m rights issue. SCI, Bowater's latest target, was formerly part of James River, but was acquired in a leveraged buy-out in 1991 by AEA Investors, a group of New York investors. It specialises in precision coating of specialist films and papers, used in the imaging, graphic and computer industries, through a number of wholly owned subsidiaries in the US, UK and the Irish Republic. For the year to December 27 1992, it made operating profits of Dollars 48.6m (Pounds 34.2m) on sales of Dollars 568m. Net assets, before deducting borrowings of Dollars 125.9m, were valued at Dollars 276.3m. Its activities can be grouped into four main areas: Graphics Technology International, which supplies microfilm, phototools, and computer output media; HP Smith and Smith &amp; McLaurin, which specialise in self-adhesive label products; Decorative Specialities International, which supplies latex-saturated paper used in book coverings and other products; and Custom Paper Group, which makes papers used in filtration and other absorbent products. Bowater said yesterday that Custom Paper, although a profitable and successful business, did not fit with Bowater's core businesses and would immediately be put up for sale. Otherwise, Mr David Lyon, Bowater's chief executive, said the acquisition would increase its annual sales of coated films and papers to Pounds 500m, or about 25 per cent of the group's annual turnover. It would also broaden Bowater's existing coating capabilities into new areas with attractive growth rates. He added that SCI's skills at finding applications and products for new processes would complement Bowater's own expertise in research and development. Mr Tim Rothwell, packaging industry analyst at brokers BZW, said SCI was an 'excellent' fit for Bowater. 'If you had asked me two years ago what was the most likely business for Bowater to acquire, this is the one I would have mentioned. It must have been irresistible for the management even if it involved another rights issue.' He said the Dollars 434m price tag, representing only 76 cents for every Dollars 1 of sales and an earnings multiple of 14.4, was attractive, while the decision to fund the deal through equity rather than debt was sensible in order to keep gearing, currently 57 per cent, under control. The deal is conditional on approval under US anti-trust legislation, hence the decision to launch the rights issue in two stages. Mr Michael Hartnall, finance director, said: 'We believe we will get clearance, although it might take longer than we would hope. AEA investors would not have put this up for sale and let us go this far if they did not believe it would be approved.' If the deal falls through, the Pounds 95m first stage of the rights issue will be used to reduce gearing and take advantage of other acquisition opportunities.</p>

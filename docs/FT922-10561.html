			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Pretoria crackdown on violence THE South African government announced a crackdown against violence and private armies yesterday and said anyone guilty of political intimidation could go to jail for 25 years, Reuter reports from Cape Town. Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee told the white-dominated parliament he would table legislation soon to support police in their fight against township and political violence that has claimed 5,000 lives since 1990. Meanwhile President F W de Klerk shelved a controversial plan for limited power sharing with blacks, ceding the initiative on interim government to a multi-party forum. Government negotiator Mr Tertius Delport said Mr de Klerk would put on ice his own proposals for interim rule while delegates to the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa) considered an alternative plan.</p>

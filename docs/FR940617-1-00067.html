			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 18. Several comments objected to the agency's proposal that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the professional labeling of povidone-iodine products containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> molecules greater than 35,000 daltons should include warnings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> against parenteral use and against exposure of open surgical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wounds or deep wounds to the product. (See comment 71, 43 FR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1210 at 1221.) Some of the comments contended that the Panel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended such warnings because it felt there was widespread  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> misuse (unapproved use) of povidone-iodine solution by surgeons  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bathing the peritoneal cavity with povidone-iodine during major  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surgery and then cleansing the area by rinsing. Another comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stated that because health-care personnel handwashes or surgical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hand scrubs require a surfactant, such products so formulated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would never be considered for peritoneal lavage by surgeons. One  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment argued that labeling to warn against parenteral use is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clearly beyond the scope of the OTC drug review and FDA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory authority. Another comment stated that it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unnecessary to establish an arbitrary molecular weight limit for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> povidone-iodine because no parenteral use of povidone-iodine is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permitted in any of the approved labeling in the new drug  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applications for those products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment stated that povidone-iodine is generally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recognized as safe and effective for use in open wounds and a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> warning against such use would be contrary to clinical experience  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with this drug. In support of this position, the comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitted a controlled study in which the surgical incisions of one group were irrigated before closure with 10 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> povidone-iodine solution, and the surgical incisions of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control group were irrigated before closure with saline solution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Ref. 1). The comment stated that the results of this study  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> showed a significant decrease in infections when povidone-iodine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was used, and there were no allergic, adverse, or other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deleterious effects following this use of povidone-iodine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to the Commissioner's recommendation for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> research data (43 FR 1210 at 1235), one comment submitted an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extensive review of the extent of scavenging of residual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> povidone-iodine molecules by the reticuloendothelial system and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possible lymph node involvement following use in the abdominal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cavity or in large wounds (Ref. 2). The comment stated that,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on these data, povidone-iodine with medium molecular  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> weights should not be limited to use on intact skin, nor should a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> warning be required. Another comment stated that the average  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> molecular weight of povidone in the povidone-iodine that has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used exclusively in topical antimicrobial products for almost a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quarter of a century is 37,900 daltons, and it presents no risk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for any of the topical antimicrobial uses covered by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tentative final monograph.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Panel recognized a relationship between molecular size  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and nodular lymphatic changes accompanying exposure to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> povidone-iodine, but made no decision on limiting the molecular  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> size causing such pathology. (See 39 FR 33103 at 33130.) In the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previous tentative final monograph, FDA evaluated data provided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in a comment (Ref. 3) that contended there should be restrictions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the use of povidone-iodine according to molecular size.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Published research cited in that comment indicated that povidone  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> molecules larger than 40,000 daltons cannot be excreted by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> kidneys, can cause nodules to appear in the lymphatic system, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may induce cosmetic deformities in the area of healing skin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wounds. Based on expert opinion and the data provided in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment (Ref. 3), the agency proposed that a molecular weight of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 35,000 daltons be established as the safe upper limit for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> povidone-iodine products used parenterally. This calculation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assumed that a povidone-iodine molecule with this molecular  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> weight would be too large to pass through the kidney. (See  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment 71, 43 FR 1210 at 1221.) FDA also noted its awareness of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the inappropriate use of povidone-iodine products in open wounds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and in the abdominal cavity during surgery. (See 43 FR 1235.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To promote proper use of povidone-iodine products, FDA proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to recognize two categories of such products. Products with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> povidone-iodine molecular weights less than 35,000 daltons would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be permitted for general use. Appropriate labeling would place  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each product in its proper category of use. The professional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> labeling of povidone-iodine products containing molecules greater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than 35,000 daltons would also include warnings against  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parenteral use of, and exposure of open surgical wounds or deep  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wounds to, the product.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Paris, March 4 (AFP) -- PLO information chief Yasir  'Abd-Rabbuh said Friday [25 February] that the presence of  international observers under UN supervision would greatly help  to restore Palestinian confidence after the Hebron massacre.    'Abd-Rabbuh, speaking after a meeting with French Foreign  Minister Alain Juppe, said an observer presence "would have a  very strong symbolic meaning to restore confidence among the  Palestinians of the occupied territories."    Juppe confirmed that France was prepared to send observers  under United Nations authority, adding that Israel's security  measures needed to be observed by "international representatives  mandated by the UN."    On Thursday [3 March] British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd  backed the idea of an international force to protect  Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and said Britain was  ready to take part.    Juppe said he hoped a UN Security Council resolution on the  observers would be passed "as soon as possible." The resolution  has been held up for almost a week because of differences with  the United States.    'Abd-Rabbuh visited Paris as part of a Palestine Liberation  Organisation effort in world capitals to explain its conditions  for resuming autonomy negotiations with Israel.    The negotiations were broken off after the massacre, in  which  52 Palestinians were slaughtered in a mosque by an Israeli  gunman.    Resuming the peace process and putting the autonomy accord  into effect would be "unthinkable" at a time when "armed  settlers are walking freely among the Palestinians," 'Abd-Rabbuh  said.    'Abd-Rabbuh will next visit Brussels for a meeting with  European Commission President Jacques Delors. Nabil Sha'th, PLO  chairman Yasir Arafat's advisor, met with Hurd in London on  Thursday before heading for Washington where he was set to meet  Secretary of State Warren Christopher on Friday.</p>

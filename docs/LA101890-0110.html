			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> RACE PROMOTERS HIT THE WALL IN DEL MAR, REROUTE MARATHON THROUGH OCEANSIDE  </P> <P> Lynn Flanagan is flabbergasted. Del Mar lets those oily, smelly, noisy race  cars rampage within its city limits on their annual Grand Prix. But they give  the boot to a bunch of runners who want to quietly lope through town.  </P> <P> "Isn't that amazing?" said Flanagan, director of In Motion, promoter of the San  Diego International Marathon.  </P> <P> This week, the City Council voted to deny permits sought by In Motion to stage  part of the 26.2-mile foot race through Del Mar on its proposed course up the  North County coast -- forcing Flanagan to reroute the 27-year-old event  exclusively through Carlsbad and Oceanside.  </P> <P> Del Mar city officials say the race just came at a bad time, and they responded  to the will of residents who were solidly against playing host to the event.  </P> <P> Flanagan, however, says the race that benefits several local charities just  became a victim of small-town politics.  </P> <P> "There's no rhyme or reason to it," she said of Del Mar's decision. "They had  some valid concerns that we spent two weeks addressing. But, when we came back  to them with a full report, they wouldn't even look at it.  </P> <P> "I was just really shocked. We spent all this time spinning our wheels for  nothing, for them just to dismiss us like that. Well, Del Mar can go ahead and  build a wall around itself for all we care."  </P> <P> The Dec. 9 race will go on as planned though, she said, starting and finishing  at the Oceanside Pier. Half the course will still hug the ocean, running south  to La Costa Avenue at the Encinitas city limits before turning east into  Carlsbad.  </P> <P> The course originally proposed would have taken runners along the entire North  County coastline from La Jolla to Oceanside.  </P> <P> "Still, it'll be a good course," Flanagan said. "We'll be in two cities that  really want us."  </P> <P> The marathon ran into a battle of red tape earlier this month when three North  County cities -- Del Mar, Encinitas and Solana Beach -- initially refused to  grant promoters the necessary permits to stage the race within their  boundaries.  </P> <P> The three cities -- all of whom have a contract with the San Diego Sheriff's  Department to provide police services -- had earlier received a letter from  Sgt. Rich Hendrickson, the department's coordinator for special events,  advising staff members against approving the race because of the manpower  needed for security.  </P> <P> "They were a key player, and unfortunately you had one officer who didn't want  to see the race run in North County," Flanagan said. "And all the cities looked  up to him as the authority. What are you going to do?"  </P> <P> Two weeks ago, promoters appealed the matter to the city councils. On Monday  night, Del Mar was the first city to officially reject being host of the event.  Both Encinitas and Solana Beach have postponed making a decision.  </P> <P> "It's all moot now," Flanagan said. "The race is coming soon. We just don't  have time to wait around anymore."  </P> <P> Del Mar Mayor Jan McMillan said the council's decision came after consulting  city staff and the Sheriff's Department. "We were listening to the people who  live here," she said.  </P> <P> Councilman Chris Helton said that, although some elements within the city want  to see Del Mar used as a stage for special events, "the majority want to see it  remain a small, quaint, residential village."  </P> <P> McMillan added that the City Council has also voted against the staging of the  annual Grand Prix road race, but it has been overruled by the state Coastal  Commission.  </P> <P> "If Lynn knew the history of our city, she'd know that we have opposed that  race," the mayor said. "I'm sorry she feels this way."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Flanagan says, race plans continue on schedule up the road in  Oceanside.  </P> <P> Pat Sanchez, director of the city's parks and recreation department, said the  city is excited about being host of the race, which he called "one of the  nation's premiere running events."  </P> <P> "We believe we should have such a race run in Oceanside," Sanchez said. "It'll  bring in 10,000 runners and their families, give them an opportunity to see  what Oceanside has to offer."  </P> <P> Oceanside, he said, has a special events office that actively solicits events  such as concerts and running and bicycle races to be staged in the city.  </P> <P> "We've dealt with promoters, and we know the long-term economic and exposure  benefits that come from these things," he said. "Apparently, Del Mar doesn't  play such an active role in special event gathering. So maybe they don't know  all the benefits."  </P> <P> Thom Hunt, who won the marathon in 1986, said an inland course might dampen the  enthusiasm of some runners. "Some are just looking for a fast course with fast  conditions," he said.  </P> <P> "But that's only a small percentage of the athletes. There's lots of marathons  staged all over the world on a year-round basis. And many runners consider  things like how scenic the route is when they choose their races."  </P> <P> In the meantime, Flanagan said this year's marathon planning has taught her a  valuable lesson when dealing with suburban politics.  </P> <P> "Stay away from it," she said.  </P></p>

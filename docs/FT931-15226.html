			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Ford executive new Acas chairman MR John Hougham, the 55-year-old head of employee relations at Ford UK, is to become chairman of Acas, the government conciliation service, David Goodhart writes. Mr Hougham beat a strong field, including Ms Brenda Dean, the former print union leader, and Mr Mike Bett, deputy chairman of BT. His appointment is expected to be formally announced by the Department of Employment today. Mr Hougham is a respected negotiator who has been at Ford since 1963. One senior trade unionist said yesterday: 'He has a reputation as a bit of a tough guy and he has certainly been in some big fights at Ford, but he is well respected on both sides of industry.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, December 31 (KCNA) -- The Secretariat of  the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland  released its Information No. 640 on December 29 denouncing the  Kim Yong-sam puppet clique's treacheries against the nation in  the nearly one year since it came to power.    The information cited facts exposing that since it seized  power the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique has committed despicable  treacheries against the nation, doing harm to and bartering away  the national interests by resorting to humiliating sycophant,  traitorous acts, "civilian" fascist dictatorship, reckless war  moves and malicious anti-North confrontation racket.    It says in part:    The traitor Kim Yong-sam, a puppet, in his "summit talks"  with the United States and at the South Korea-U.S. "annual  Security Consultative Meeting" in July and November offered to  pay more than 3,000 million dollars for the maintenance of the  U.S. Forces present in South Korea, begging for their permanent  presence in South Korea, and had the planned U.S. troop cutback  in South Korea shelved.    During his visit to the United States in November he begged  his master to "exercise strong influence", raising a hue and cry  over the "suspicion of North's nuclear development", a  fictitious talk. And, in a bid to put the brake on the progress  of the DPRK-U.S. talks, he entreated his master to object to the  North-proposed formula of package solution of the nuclear  problem and establish an "international cooperation system"  aimed at stifling the same fellow countrymen, and promised in  privacy to open in return for it the South Korean rice market, a  matter which even his preceding dictators didn't dare to deal  with.    Further still, the traitor invited the Japanese prime  minister to South Korea in early November and asked for "joint  action" against the North's "nuclear problem" till its solution.  He blared that South Korea and Japan should "develop their  relationship into future-oriented one", whitewashing the  thrice-cursed brutalities committed by the Japanese imperialists  against the Korean people in the past.    Since it took the helm of power the Kim Yong-sam puppet  clique has zealously followed the anti-socialist moves of the  international reactionaries to stifle the DPRK.    Taking office, the traitor Kim Yong-sam made quite a noise  as  if he would bring about any "change" in the relations between  the North and the South, saying "relations with the North would  be improved from the viewpoint of the same nation". But it was  a mere deception designed to mislead public opinion at home and  abroad.    His criminal records reveal to the whole world that he has  committed heinous crimes in bringing dark clouds of war over the  head of the nation and driving the North-South relations to the  worst phase.</p>

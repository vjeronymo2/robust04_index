			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Finance Minister Ivan Szabo by Miklos </F> Merenyi; place and date not given: "Deficit Is the Cost of  Growth"]    [Text] The upset economic balance is a harbinger of growth,  states Ivan Szabo, with whom we also tried to draw the balance  of his barely more than one year in the Finance Ministry.  According to Szabo, growth increases the demand for investment  goods, therefore, we have to expect a deficit in the payment  balance for years to come. This will establish the foundations  for the long-awaited boom.    [Merenyi] Nowadays, the biggest economic policy debates are  induced by the attempts to find out what the upset macroeconomic  balance indicates: The fact that the crisis is prolonged or  that growth has started. What is your view?    [Szabo] The truth is somewhere between the two. The same  figures can indicate different phenomena. At the end of 1992  and the beginning of 1993, the primary cause of the decline was  our reduced exports, which in turn was mainly caused by the  recession in Western Europe. However, now, the same figure of  balance deficit indicates something else. The bigger half of  imports consisted of investment goods in 1993, too.    The payment balance will continue to be negative for another  three to four years and Western recession will play a decreasing  role in this. The main cause will be the investment needs of  growth.    [Merenyi] This has never been questioned by anyone. At the  same time, the statistical data give the impression that the  decisive section of imports is used for stocking up raw  materials and for consumer goods. Some of the foreign resources  cover public consumption.    [Szabo] It is undoubtedly true that public consumption has  increased to a certain extent. However, this was not decisive  in 1993, either. If I disregard the fighter planes bought from  Russia in exchange for the Soviet state debt, then half of the  remaining amount consisted of engineering imports. Half of the  consumer goods imports consists of pharmaceutical products which  again is not in the luxury category. Therefore, the proportions  are increasingly shifting toward investments that are the basis  of growth.    I admit that stockpiling in the enterprises is an existing  phenomenon, however, the 4.3 percent industrial growth consumes  this: The industrial sphere began to grow already in 1993 and  the agricultural sphere will do this in 1994. The GDP may rise  by as much as 1.5 percent. This will not, of course, be an even  growth, but it is certain that we are over the worst. It is  possible that the point is that the state of the economy is  better than can be shown by statistics.    [Merenyi] The balance of payments deficit ultimately means  the import of foreign resources because it is only partially  covered by the inflow of working capital. In other words, the  debt is increasing. For how long?    [Szabo] We also have to add here that the repayment of debts  means a huge withdrawal of resources from the Hungarian economy.  Therefore, the real question in my view is if the incoming  resources do actually serve economic growth. In other words,  whether there will be some gain from it or will it only help to  finance the budget deficit. In 1991, the budget situation was  much better, perhaps we should have taken on more loans for  modernization at that time. However, at that time, everyone was  very cautious about increasing the foreign debt.    [Merenyi] And mainly the Hungarian Democratic Forum was  cautious.    [Szabo] Not only. The attitude that the requirements of the  balance have to be placed above growth was generally accepted in  financial circles. This was partly justified by the need to  suppress inflation. Nevertheless, it might have been worthwhile  increasing the debt by a few billion U.S. dollars at that time.    [Merenyi] Has the government decided on any measures that  will improve the balance?    [Szabo] The cabinet is very seriously dealing with the issue  that once we managed to induce some growth, it should not be  quashed by a general suppression of consumption which also cools  off investments. We have to find methods to curb the  population's consumption, especially the luxury consumption.    [Merenyi] Is it not shortsighted that in December 1993, at  the Finance Ministry's initiative, the limit that defined to  what extent the Hungarian National Bank [MNB] can finance the  budget deficit was lifted?    [Szabo] In my view, the formulation of the central bank law  proved shortsightedness because it did not detect the negative  processes in the economy, and it remained insensitive to the  budget difficulties. Raising the former 4-percent financing  limit to 80 billion forints meant that economic reality was  taken into consideration. Naturally, in the long run, it is  best if the central bank simply does not participate in  financing the budget. I am now expecting a quiet breakthrough  on this. The central bank as a foreign currency authority has  just given permission to the Finance Ministry to issue forint  bonds to people classed as foreigners under the Foreign  Exchanges Act. This is the first step.    [Merenyi] Has the Finance Ministry's relationship with the  MNB improved since the bank started to conduct a less strict  financial policy and personnel changes were also implemented?    [Szabo] This is not an issue of personnel. All institutions  protect rock solidly their power positions. The central bank,  for example, protected its foreign exchange monopoly while the  commercial banks began to issue bonds on the international  capital and money markets. However, at the time, the MNB did  not give permission to the state to do this.    [Merenyi] The debate on the forint devaluation also  accompanied the government's operation. What are your views on  this now?    [Szabo] If the pressure of wage increases above the level of  inflation is not removed through a social agreement, devaluation  only has a short-term benefit and much rather helps the prices  than exports to increase.    [Merenyi] Among the many contradictory indicators, there  is a clear one: The budget deficit is at the planned level.  This has not happened before. What is the reason?    [Szabo] Although occasional "blows" exist on both the  revenue and expenditure sides, we managed to keep them in  balance. In addition to this, we have also had a change of  attitude: When we calculated the 330-billion-forint deficit, we  tried to produce a realistic figure. We have also achieved  positive results in the area of tax discipline. In addition to  this, for the first time this year, the issuance of bonds is  scheduled which eliminates the liquidity problems of the central  budget.    [Merenyi] So the taxpayers are better at paying. Has the  management of publicly financed institutions become stricter?    [Szabo] This is a question of the reform of state finances.  We are not working on an overall program, rather, we are  examining the duties of the central sphere. We will be able to  include the results of this in next year's budget.    The discipline of management has to be strengthened and has  to be newly regulated in laws. From financing in proportion to  time, we have to progress toward financing that is linked to  performance. It is important to regulate anew the management of  treasury assets, and to accept the law on public purchases; we  will hand over the draft bill on this to the next government.  It is also unavoidable to reduce the number of special funds,  at least to the level that is used in the European Union.    [Merenyi] These are obvious facts for experts. Why have  these measures not been taken in the past years?    [Szabo] Measures have certainly been taken. However, they  are very difficult to implement. The deficit of state finances  is so big now that necessity will force the implementation of  these measures....    [Merenyi] Why is the government's decision being delayed on  the second step of bank consolidation?    [Szabo] The government decided in 1993 that the capital  injections have to be completed by 31 May. Concrete technical  preparations are in progress, and this does not require further  government decisions. The government will receive reports after  the general meetings.    [Merenyi] At what stage is the report that you will hand  over to your successor on the work of the Finance Ministry?    [Szabo] The report on the Finance Ministry's personnel and  structural situation will be completed by the end of May. In  addition to this, we are preparing an overall report on the  processes that have been completed and the ones that are at the  preparation stage. I am convinced that my successor will  receive a well-arranged and clear report whichever party he  should represent. I would have been very happy if I had been  able to take over the leadership of finance in the same way.  Unfortunately, I found nothing but empty drawers. I did not  receive anything from my predecessor. I learned from this and I  know how inconvenient it was.    [Merenyi] Will this summary include the list of guarantees  taken on by the government?    [Szabo] On the basis of end-of-March data I can say that we  are maintaining 48 guarantees based on individual government  decisions and these amount to 122 billion forints. At the most,  some 22 billion forints will apply to 1994, however, it is  unlikely that the whole amount will be drawn. The final  scheduling of the guarantees will be contained in the bank  contracts, and a significant amount of them can only be drawn  after a five- to 10-year wait. Therefore, I believe that if we  adhere to the 3-percent limit defined in the law on state  finances then we are not taking on a big risk. At the same  time, we are helping the development of industrial capacities  suitable for export production for which it is justified to give  guarantees.</p>

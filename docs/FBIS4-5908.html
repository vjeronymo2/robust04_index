			<p>BFN     [Text] Iraq has recently notified South Korea that it will  temporarily close down its embassy in Seoul, citing poor  economic conditions in the country caused by a long-standing  U.N. trade embargo.    In the notification delivered to the Foreign Ministry April  6, Baghdad hoped that despite the measure, "the friendly  relations" between the two countries would be strengthened, said  a ministry official.    He said the Iraqi government also promised to reopen its  embassy here as soon as its economic conditions improve.    The Iraqi Embassy housed in a two-story building in  Tongbinggo- tong, central Seoul, will be actually shut down late  next month, said the official.    South Korea and Iraq established formal diplomatic ties in  July 1989, upgrading the consulate-general in each others  capital to an embassy.    The Seoul government, however, withdrew embassy staff,  including the ambassador, from Baghdad in January 1991 when  tensions were mounting in the Gulf region after the Iraqi  invasion of Kuwait the previous year.    South Korean diplomats so far have not returned to Baghdad.    The ministry official said a South Korean diplomat who is  working as acting ambassador to Iraq is now stationed in the  Jordanian capital of Amman.    Since setting up diplomatic ties in 1989, Iraq has not  assigned an ambassador to Seoul and has been represented by a  charge d'affaires.    While Iraq cited its economic predicament as the reason for  its decision to close down the embassy in Seoul, some diplomatic  observers here suspect the decision may reflect Iraq's  dissatisfaction with Seoul for not reopening its embassy in  Baghdad.    When reached by phone, Taha H. Mohammed, Iraqi charge  d'affaires, rebuffed the speculation.    He emphasized the decision was from a purely economic  motivation.    "We'll be ready to come back and open our embassy again  (when  the Iraqi economy gets better)," he said.    "We have found Korean people and companies cooperative with  Iraq and I hope good relationship will still be maintained  between the two countries," he added. (KKH)</p>

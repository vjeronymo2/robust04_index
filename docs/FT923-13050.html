			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / International Company News: Sluggish US economy hits paper, pulp industry earnings INTERNATIONAL Paper yesterday reported a marginal increase in second-quarter earnings per share, while Boise Cascade announced a Dollars 45m loss as the sluggish US economy continued to depress the earnings of the paper and pulp industry. 'While some indicators suggest recessionary pressures may be easing, the pace of recovery is slower than previously anticipated,' said Mr John Georges, chairman of International Paper. 'If the economy continues to grow at a modest rate, and if we are able to obtain further modest increases in paper prices, Boise Cascade should return to profitability during 1993,' said Mr John Fery, the chairman of that company. The US paper industry has been suffering from a sharp cyclical downturn for the past two years but analysts have been forecasting a modest recovery during 1992. However, another leading manufacturer, Georgia-Pacific, depressed Wall Street expectations last week when it announced it would only make a small second-quarter profit. International Paper, which has made a strong push into Europe in recent years, reported second-quarter earnings of Dollars 112m on sales of Dollars 3.4bn, up from Dollars 100m on sales of Dollars 3.1bn in the second quarter of last year. However, a large share issue early in 1992 meant that the earnings worked through at just 92 cents a share, compared with 91 cents a year ago. International Paper said its timber and wood products business remained strong and the consumer packaging business showed an improvement. Prices for uncoated printing and writing papers in the US and European markets had weakened as the quarter progressed, but containerboard demand and operating rates continued at high levels. Specialty paper earnings were up on a year ago. Boise Cascade's second-quarter loss, which worked through at Dollars 1.38 a share, compared with losses of Dollars 32.6m, or 95 cents a share, in the same period of last year. Sales totalled Dollars 922m, down from Dollars 978m. Boise Cascade said the operating performance of its paper and paper products division in the second quarter continued to be severely affected by weak paper prices, which were on average modestly below the very low levels reached in the first quarter. Results compared unfavourably with a year ago. Prices for business and printing papers and market pulp strengthened modestly in the second quarter, relative to the first quarter, but newsprint, coated and uncoated groundwood paper prices reached new lows in the cycle. The group's office products segment, hit by the weak US economy, saw profits down from a year ago on slightly higher sales volume. The dip was attributed to a seasonal swing from the first quarter, pressure on margins and the divestiture of the wholesale office products distribution operations. Building products saw income modestly stronger than the second quarter of last year but down on the first quarter of this year. Lumber prices rose to record levels in the first quarter but have moderated since then.</p>

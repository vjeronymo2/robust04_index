			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Letter: Two-tier board no answer Sir, We do not agree with the view of Mr John Cheele (Letters, April 13) that the adoption of a form of two-tier board system is the solution to reconciling the position of executive directors in their respective roles of directors and of executives. Of course, there are areas of a company's activities where executives have a perceived self-interest. Examples are audit, remuneration and nomination, and companies should deal with possible conflicts of interest by establishing committees of the board in these areas, having a majority of non-executive directors, and reporting to the board as a whole. This in no way derogates from the principle of a unitary board, with all directors having equal responsibility.

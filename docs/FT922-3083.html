			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Man in the News: Risky rise to millionaires' row - Derek Hunt The management buy-out craze has produced some pretty strange millionaires, but perhaps none so unlikely as Derek Hunt, the man about to steer MFI Furniture back to the stock market with a price tag of Pounds 750m or more. He will get a Pounds 1.3m bonus when the flotation takes place. Some of his edges have been smoothed since the boisterous northerner led the company's management buy-out in 1987. The raggle-taggle of blond curls has been replaced by a rather more consciously styled, slightly bouffant, hair-do. And he has caught what he calls the golf bug. But he celebrated his 53rd birthday last Tuesday with his favourite brew, Newcastle Brown Ale, provided by one of the brokers to the issue. 'A super touch,' Hunt says. There have been times in the years since the buy-out when it looked as though Hunt would not make it to the million mark at all. Hit by the rise in interest rates in 1989 - which had the double effect of depressing sales of furniture and raising the cost of the group's Pounds 500m of debt - MFI did well to escape the fate of rivals such as Lowndes Queensway, another leveraged buy-out in the household goods retail market which went into receivership in 1990. Despite the trials of heading a retail buy- out in the worst recession since the 1930's the grammar school boy from Darlington, County Durham, has retained a genuine warmth and humour. Asked what he is going to do with his Pounds 1.3m, less 40 per cent tax, he says that he and John Randall, the finance director, have decided that the best place for it is the Post Office Savings Bank. It would be a far safer bet than the Pounds 80,000 investment he made in the Pounds 718m buy-out of MFI in November 1987. That original stake will give him between 0.2 and 0.5 per cent of the company's shares depending on the issue price. The money could have been lost entirely. 'A year ago it looked as though there was nothing in it for us,' Hunt says. He had not mortgaged his house as some of his colleagues did. But, he says, when you invest heavily in a business you work for, you can lose not only your savings but your income too. 'And in my case any future prospects of employment,' At the outset Hunt and the 350 executives and managers who bought into the business expected to be able to cash in their investments within three years  -and to make a big profit. Together they had 3.75 per cent of the company, which could have risen to more than 25 per cent if targets for the timing and price of the planned flotation were met. Because the targets were missed, this group of investors will share between 2 and 5 per cent of the equity, which will be enlarged by the flotation. Throughout the buy-out period Hunt has felt responsible for his colleagues' investments. Even while carrying Pounds 500m of debt, Hunt, a man whose build is reminiscent of his time as a rugby prop forward, says he felt the responsiblity to the employees was the heavier burden. 'You must remember why we did the buy-out in the first place,' he says. 'Asda put it up for sale.' The most embarrassing moment in the whole buy-out, Hunt recollects, was when the recession forced a refinancing in 1989 which involved a rights issue. Hunt says that he and Randall 'fought tooth and nail' to prevent the staff investors being asked to put up more of their savings. In the event, however, this could not be avoided. 'I felt bad about that,' Hunt says. His loyalty to his staff is returned by a fierce commitment from them. Of the 9,000 employees, 1,500 have worked for MFI for more than 10 years. Paul Whitney, chief executive of CIN Management, one of the backers of the buy-out and now a non-executive director of the group, says that one of Hunt's great strengths is his rapport with the staff right down to the grass roots. 'They have tremendous respect for his abilities and that counts for a lot,' he says. His worst moment, Hunt says, was when Randall rang him on his mobile phone one day in May 1989 and said: 'I thought I had to tell you, Derek, we're not going to make it.' The business had run out of cash, interest payments were looming, and the team had to go back to its banks and shareholders for the refinancing. At the time, Hunt thought MFI might fail. 'During the refinancing there were times when I believed it could happen. But looking back we were quite a long way away,' he reflects. A fair part of MFI's survival must be down to Hunt himself. He is a determined man, 'my wife calls me stubborn', he says. According to Randall: 'We succeeded because Derek didn't know we were beat.' MFI's strengths included a management team which has been together now for 13 years and had run the business even before it was bought by Asda. 'They are very much on top of the business,' says Whitney, 'responding fast to make adjustments.' Sales were volatile, but there was always an underlying core to the business which even in the worst year made a profit of Pounds 48.6m before the interest payments on its debt. The business has not simply been run for cash as many highly-leveraged companies are. More than Pounds 250m has been invested in the business which has acquired the Schreiber brand of bedroom furniture, expanded into France, and developed and begun to roll out a new store format. Hunt himself has been slimmed down though. He admits to losing three stones in weight since the buy-out, a reduction of a sixth. An attempt to give up smoking, though, has failed. Is it the pressure? 'No, I'm just a nicotine addict,' he says, but he has promised to give up again after the float. What about the future? 'When you've been where we've been you can deal with anything in business terms,' he reckons. Meanwhile he is just going to enjoy the flotation and look forward to a golfing holiday, probably in Florida.</p>

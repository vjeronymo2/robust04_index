			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article signed by "Ghania Oukazi" and "T.H.": "Lambese: </F> Secrets From the Breakout" -- first two paragraphs are EL WATAN  introduction]    [Text] Despite the numerous scenarios that have been  advanced with regard to the famous breakout, we have not heard  the last word about Lambese.    An eyewitness who was present on the scene was willing to  provide us with certain secrets that, in his mind, make up a  large-scale act of treason.    Tazoult--from our special envoys--"No one can be proud of  what happened at Lambese; I never thought treason on that scale  could ever take place," we were told by this witness who is  still, even today, very shaken by everything he saw.    Indeed, from the standpoint of its reputation, the Tazoult  prison has always been termed an impregnable citadel. The prison  was worthy of being an "Alcatraz"! Here is an account of one of  the most mysterious breakouts.    Everything seemed normal in this peaceful town with its  Islamic majority. On Thursday, 10 March, at around 1700, close  to 300 persons armed with Kalashnikovs spilled into this small  town in the Aures Mountains. Working with a plan that had long  been drawn up in minute detail, they divided up into groups,  each one charged with carrying out a well defined task.    The first task was first to isolate Lambese from neighboring  areas by setting up two roadblocks, one on the road leading to  Batna and the other on the Khenchela road.    Furthermore two vehicles, one a yellow J5, the other a  "Lada," went separately to the only gendarmerie post and police  station. The terrorists' goal was to neutralize all security  forces. Neither gendarmes nor police officers resisted.    Other terrorists dispersed throughout Tazoult's narrow  streets to prevent its residents from leaving.    As for the prison, it was besieged by about 100 of the men  who began by parking two "Sonacome"-make trucks in front of the  main gate. This gate had been cordially opened by a guard by the  name of Benoui who was an accomplice.    To reach the second gate, which opened onto the detention  areas, i.e., the cells, the attackers were aided by two other  guards.    In fact, then and there, Lagoune (a former commando) and  another guard, both natives of Barika, killed their colleague  guarding the second gate who was "not part of the deed."    When he heard the shots, the director, Mohamed Latrache,  called Hama, who is also nicknamed "I-don't-give-a-damn," ran  out of his house that was next to the prison's first gate. "Why  have you shot our colleague?" he asked Lagoune.    In response, the latter shot the director twice, failing to  hit him. From that moment on, the top prison official completely  vanished into thin air. He reappeared only when the  investigation committee arrived. However, he was the only one in  possession of the keys to the place where the heavy weapons,  especially three FMPKs, were stored. Once the two gates were  opened, the attackers burst into the inner detention perimeter  by overwhelming 13 guards in charge of overseeing the various  cells from 1700 to 0100. They next proceeded to open all the  cells in the three death sentence corridors supposed to be as  impenetrable as the ways of the Lord.    These corridors cannot accommodate more than 80 death  sentence prisoners. The cells have names; some of them are  called "high-risk cells," containing 12 prisoners sentenced to  death kept chained day and night while there are other  low-ceilinged cells where 10 prisoners serving the same sentence  are kept as well as the mentally ill who need to be isolated.    In the vicinity a place called the cave could be glimpsed  made up of five cells with prisoners sentenced to death. All of  these cells were opened as well as eight sections of 50  individual cells, each located in an area called "the junction."    In all there were no fewer than 400 cells housing prisoners  serving long terms.    All of these cells were opened by the terrorists with  alarming ease.    In this regard, our eyewitness stated that the terrorists  carried duplicates of the keys to all the cells. They were keys  that had been molded in clay; this is one way of copying the  master. However the rules are strict and require that at the end  of each guard shift the keys absolutely be returned to the  director, who is the only and the sole person responsible for  the special box in which they are stored. So each guard turns  over the keys to the cells he is in charge of to his station  head together with a list of prisoners after having signed the  register.    The station head then turns the keys over to the head of  detention before ending up with the director.    This process is repeated several times each day, i.e., each  time there is a shift of guards.    Out of all the prison's cells, only "the star" and "the  lower  quarter" were not opened.    "The star" is made up of four common rooms, each one  containing 250 people, while the other 10 rooms in "the lower  quarter" contain common criminals serving short sentences. All  of these people seemed not to be of interest to the attackers  since their main goal was to free "the hard core."    Many of the released prisoners had the right to have a  weapon. Those sentenced to death were carried in trucks and took  the Khenchela road. The attackers also attacked the infirmary so  as to free one of their paralyzed "emirs" who was receiving  care. Besides, in so doing, they did not hesitate to forcefully  "ship out" Kamel Soukhal, the main infirmary attendant, who was  serving a 15-year jail term for drug trafficking in Annaba.    The other escapees, who did not enjoy much help from the  terrorists, were forced to get to the Ain Touta Mountains on  foot. This helped the police, who were deployed three hours  later, arrest a great number of them.    However, certain prisoners, not knowing where to go and  roaming through the village, were turned over by local residents  to the gendarmerie.    One thing is certain and that is that most of the ex-Islamic  Salvation Front [FIS] militants who had been jailed for acts of  terrorism were freed to the cries of women and the "Allahu  Akbars" of men that emerged from some homes.    Throughout the entire operation, the prison's electricity  was  not shut off and the lights in all the guard towers were lit.  This was a fact that, as usual, slowed the breakfast hour back  to the same time as the muezzin's call to prayer. Now no guard  thought to sound the high emergency alarm siren to alert  authorities to what was happening.    In this regard, the surrounding neighborhood remembers the  revolt that took place on 27 December 1978 that was brought  under control thanks to the signal set off by the high emergency  siren. The entire operation was carried out with the blessing of  accomplices, the main ones being the three guards, [?Laagoune]  and his associates, known as inveterate Islamic fundamentalists.    The witness pointed out that the Lambese prison houses more  than 3,000 prisoners and at least 500 guards. Most of the latter  are young and inexperienced. "There are some of them who do not  even know how to handle a weapon," he said.    Furthermore, and according to the same source, the director,  who was named to this position in 1989, does not have the  qualifications required to run a prison of this scale. He was  formerly the chief electrician in the same jail and has never  done guard duty.    Others have charged him with having a regionalist cast of  mind with respect to certain guards who come from different  tribes in the area. The operation, when all is said and done,  lasted two long hours. The toll was 906 escapees, only about 100  of whom have been captured.    At the end of their deed, the attackers fired five times  from  the interior of the prison to signal the end of the operation.  They left, damaging a segment of the road leading towards  Khenchela and to gain time and obstruct any pursuit.    This is the version of the facts as told by the eyewitness.    Furthermore, and as of press time, the commission of inquiry  has revealed nothing "official." It headed towards the capital  this Thursday. Despite nonstop efforts by reporters, its members  have not even deigned to receive them.    A protest letter written by reporters present on the scene  was even given to the military authorities in Batna.    As to Lambese's director, still shaken by events, he even  received reporters at the entrance to the prison but declined to  make any statement in the absence of any official authorization.    For its part, Tazoult has returned to its usual quiet and  police left the town three days following the operation. But the  sweeps still continue in the mountains as well as the thorough  checks. Helicopters fly over the area nonstop.    Even if Tazoult's residents are not about to forget what has  recently occurred, that is not preventing them from strolling in  the streets, sipping a cup of coffee, or even playing a game of  table soccer.</p>

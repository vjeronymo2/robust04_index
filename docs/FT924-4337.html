			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Most French and British couples prove faithful BRITISH and French sex habits differ little and few men and women are unfaithful to their partners, according to two studies published today. Both Britain and France are populated mainly by faithful heterosexual couples, according to the first large surveys of sexual behaviour in the two countries. According to interviews with random selections of 20,000 people in each country, only about 6 per cent of women and 13 per cent of men have had more than one sexual partner within the past year. And just 4 per cent of Frenchmen and 6 per cent of men in the UK say they have ever had any kind of homosexual experience. The spread of Aids during the 1980s prompted both studies. Health authorities felt handicapped in planning strategies to prevent HIV infection by their ignorance about people's sexual behaviour. The French survey, conducted by the Agence Nationale de Researches sur le Sida, was funded by the government. But Mrs Thatcher, then prime minister, refused to let the Department of Health support the UK study which she saw as an invasion of privacy; the Wellcome Trust, the largest medical charity, provided the Pounds 750,000 required. The preliminary results, published in the journal Nature, are unlikely to shock Lady Thatcher but the researchers say they will help those fighting Aids and other sexually transmitted diseases. Yesterday the scientists said the apparent absence of widespread promiscuity seemed reassuring. Although one British man in 16 reported having had some kind of sexual experience with another man, only one in 28 had ever had a 'homosexual partner' and one in 74 had a partner within the past five years. But in London one man in 20 had a homosexual partner in the last five years. One interesting finding is that people in the highest social classes (managerial and professional) are twice as likely as manual workers to have had two or more sexual partners within the past year. The researchers believe this is because higher incomes and greater mobility give many more opportunities for sexual encounters. The French survey showed an encouraging increase in the use of condoms by those most at risk from HIV infection. Although any survey of intimate personal information is liable to be distorted by the participants lying, the researchers said both studies contained internal and external consistency checks which gave them confidence in the findings. The fact that men claimed more heterosexual partners than there were women acknowledging partnership may be due partly to male boastfulness and female reticence, but it can also be explained by the existence of prostitutes.</p>

			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Interest rates to be cut in Australia Australia's official interest rates are likely to be cut later this month following an unexpected improvement in the current account deficit and a rise in the value of the Australian dollar, Kevin Brown writes. The Labor government and the conservative opposition parties both indicated that the stronger currency clears the way for a cut in rates, whatever the outcome of the federal election on March 13. The Australian dollar closed just over one US cent higher at 70.27 cents after the government statistical agency said the current account deficit narrowed in January to ADollars 489m (Pounds 232m), seasonally adjusted. The January figure was the lowest monthly deficit for five years. The agency also issued revised monthly figures for the first six months of the 1992-93 financial year which suggested that the full-year deficit will be below the Treasury forecast of ADollars 17bn. The announcement sparked a bond market rally which cut the yield on the 10-year bond to 7.75 per cent from 7.98 per cent. The yield on three-month bills fell nine points to 5.41 per cent. The last easing of monetary policy was in July, when the official cash rate was reduced by 75 basis points to 5.75 per cent.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These concerns have been forwarded to the Navy for resolution, since they are beyond the scope of NMFS' authority.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter wanted the Navy ship shock trials subject to oversight by a civilian committee drawn from among marine mammal protectionists and civic leaders in the affected area, including the City of Malibu.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The regulations and LOA authorizing the incidental taking require the Navy to allow NMFS personnel onboard vessels and aircraft during ship shock trials and other operations using explosives within the OSTR. NMFS authority does not extend to requiring the Navy to be subject to an oversight committee of citizens. The comment has been forwarded to the Navy for consideration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter asserted that if the LOA is issued, ``a financial bonus will accrue to the Southwest Fisheries Science Center in La Jolla. This represents a clear conflict of interest on the part of NMFS. The appearance of a conflict could have been mitigated had other entities with marine mammal monitoring experience been requested to bid; that would also have resulted in the lowest cost estimate by SWFSC, which had no incentive to trim its cost estimate and which will have no incentive to limit actual costs to an amount less than the estimated costs.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NMFS does not concur with this assessment. The Navy, in 1992, made preliminary inquiries regarding the cost of conducting marine mammal surveys with private entities experienced in marine mammal surveys, in addition to the NMFS' SWFSC. The Navy independently determined that NMFS would be able to conduct the surveys at approximately one-third the cost of the other groups contacted. With that determination made, the Navy made an inter-agency transfer of funds to NMFS to conduct the surveys and post-test monitoring. The SWFSC proposal was included in the application of the Navy for a small take authorization and available therefor for review and comment at that time. No comments were received on the proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Changes from the Proposed Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The codification scheme in the final rule has been modified to avoid a conflict with another proposed rule (58 FR 33425,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> June 17, 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Description of Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The subject regulations govern the incidental taking of marine mammals during the detonation of conventional explosives in the OSTR off Pt. Mugu, CA. The regulations are based on the entire rulemaking record including evidence submitted in an application from the Navy that the detonation of conventional explosives off the Channel Islands, CA, over the next 5 years may involve the incidental taking (harassment, injury or death) of marine mammals. NMFS has determined that the total taking will involve small numbers of marine mammals and will have a negligible impact on the species for which the take is requested, their habitat, and the availability of these species for subsistence uses. Although two of the species of pinnipeds on the Channel Islands, the northern fur seal and the harbor seal, are taken for subsistence in Alaska, an incidental take from the populations in the Channel Islands would not reduce the availability of these species for subsistence in Alaska. Therefore, NMFS has determined that this incidental taking will not have an unmitigable adverse impact on the availability of marine mammals for subsistence by Alaska natives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations apply only to Navy projects involving the underwater detonation of conventional explosives in the offshore waters of the OSTR of the NAWC, off Pt. Mugu, Ventura County, CA. All activities must be conducted in a manner that minimizes adverse effects on marine mammals authorized to be taken and their habitat and in conformance with any requirements in a LOA issued under these regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under these regulations NMFS is issuing the Navy a 1-year LOA. This LOA is the official document allowing the incidental taking of marine mammals. It will be renewed annually upon receipt of a report detailing activities conducted during the previous 12 months, including levels of taking of marine mammals, provided the required mitigation measures are undertaken and the annual taking authorizations are not exceeded. If a species' annual authorization is exceeded, NMFS will review the documentation submitted with the annual report to ensure that the taking continues to have no more than a negligible impact on the species or stock involved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

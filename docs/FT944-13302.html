			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / World Trade News: HK tycoon plugs in to subcontinent - Wu mothballs China plans and signs Dollars 19.5bn power deals The man who has taken up the World Bank's invitation to switch the lights on in India and Pakistan has been forced west by the prospect of diminishing returns in east Asia. In a matter of weeks, Mr Gordon Wu, one of Hong Kong's more flamboyant tycoons, mothballed his plans to build and manage power stations across China and signed agreements for power projects in India and Pakistan worth about Dollars 19.5bn over ten years. He is already scouting the Indian subcontinent for more. The Harvard-educated businessman had China firmly in his sights last year when he raised HKDollars 5.94bn (Dollars 769m) with the flotation of the Consolidated Electric Power Asia (CEPA). This company, which was hived off from Mr Wu's flagship company, Hopewell Holdings, was sold to investors as a play on China's massive power requirements - a need on which China will spend some Dollars 120bn over the next decade to satisfy. At the time of its December listing, CEPA boasted two China power plants, Shajiao B and Shajiao C, the latter of which is still under construction, and letters of intent for another 14. Of more importance to the investors who swooped on the new scrip, CEPA had the visionary Mr Wu and his 'cookie cutter' approach to power plants - building a string of generators with the same design, thus bringing economies of scale, across China. Mr Wu favours the build-operate-transfer (BOT) model whereby CEPA builds the plants, operates them for a specified period, and then transfers ownership back to the government. The anxieties of government (especially communist governments) are allayed by the fact that ownership ultimately returns to the state, while the company benefits from playing a raft of money-making roles: civil engineering, project development and project management. However, these plans were scuppered earlier this year when it became clear China's reform-minded officials were starting to baulk at foreigners extracting robust profits from strategic industries and that a cap was to be placed on returns which could be netted on power projects. In the absence of clear guidelines from Beijing, bankers and other industry players (not least those at CEPA) are still unclear as to the nature of this cap, which initially stood at 12 per cent but is now believed to have been lifted to 15 per cent. For example, it is not clear whether the rate of return referred to is on equity or capital employed. CEPA promptly switched tack, and this year prefaced the deals in the Indian subcontinent with two in the Philippines and Indonesia. It is still pursuing a project in China, in the southern coastal city of Shenzhen, for four units of 660 MW. Mr Wu hopes to have a power purchase agreement from the Shenzhen authorities by early next year. But the China experience has induced a wariness among the company's management. Although the India and Pakistan projects announced earlier in the month triggered a share price rally, directors are taking an untypically low-key stance. For all the potential of the latest projects, they remain at the memorandum of understanding (MoU) stage. As one CEPA executive says: 'An MoU could stay an MoU forever. This is what we have in China. We have lots of letters of intent, which are similar to MoUs elsewhere, and they are just paralysed and have been for almost a year.' The India connection was brought about through the World Bank, and followed a visit in which Mr Wu put forward an initial proposal to build power stations. The World Bank had been urging CEPA to assess power station projects for some time, according to the company, but it postponed action because of the anticipated workload in China. Last month the invitation was taken up in style: an entire team of technical and commercial chiefs met Mr PV Narasimha Rao, prime minister, as well as representatives from the ministries of finance and power, and an MoU was issued. However, CEPA is upbeat about opportunities for the power industry in the Indian subcontinent. On a per capita basis, India has a still bigger requirement than China. In India, where there are as yet no stated guidelines, CEPA reckons it can squeeze an internal rate of return of close to 20 per cent, while in Pakistan the limit has been set at 18 per cent. The projects in Shenzhen, Indonesia and the Philippines are also expected to give returns over 18 per cent. Assuming the proposed 16 units of 660 MWs in India go ahead, funding will come from a variety of sources, including the International Finance Corporation, which is affiliated to the World Bank, commercial bank loans and global equity markets - ultimately, each of the company's power projects is likely to be spun off as a separate listing, creating a string of CEPA subsidiaries and raising additional funds from shareholders. At this stage, funding is a long way from being one of CEPA's most pressing concerns. The nature of power plants means spending will be spread over 10 or 12 years. Meanwhile, there is the HKDollars 5.94bn raised from the CEPA flotation - much of which was earmarked for the China projects. That listing was itself controversial, as it in effect stripped the China and Philippines power station projects out of Hopewell Holdings, which was then on a price-earnings ratio of around 16 times (slightly higher than the Hong Kong market as a whole) and sold them back to investors packaged as CEPA, on a p/e ratio of around 39 times (in part a measure of the time lag before the power plants could start to produce big earnings). However, the Hong Kong market at that time was awash with both liquidity and bullish sentiment, especially for anything with the word 'China' prominent in the prospectus, and the HKDollars 1.17bn public element of the combined offering was 45 times oversubscribed. CEPA blames itself for failing to communicate better with these shareholders now that they complain they bought into a China stock that failed to materialise. Mr Ricky Lau, assistant to director Lawrence Miao, says the reasons for CEPA's recast focus were not well communicated to investors, but he believes this has now been rectified. Moreover, he says, the Shenzhen project is still very much on the cards, a testimony to the growing autonomy of provincial governments in the southern coastal provinces.</p>

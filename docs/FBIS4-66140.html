			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Paolo Mieli: "Three Questions Remain"] </F>   [Text] It must not be considered an anomaly that yesterday  evening's Senate session granted (with one vote more than the  quorum and by four votes over the opposition) a vote of  confidence in the government headed by Silvio Berlusconi, even  though on paper it did not command a majority in that chamber.  It is neither anomalous nor something definitive or irreversible  which, for instance, could not be overturned when it comes to  debating issues of great importance or constitutional  amendments. Yesterday the Senate acknowledged the fact that,  thanks to the winner-take-all system, the coalition led by the  new prime minister won the elections and decided that it was  correct to put it to the test. This, even though it lacks an  absolute majority of seats in the chamber headed by  Scognamiglio. Let us say at once that we consider this a display  of wisdom. For the opposition forces, too, it is better, much  better, to reserve their strength for fundamental matters of  principle rather than to waste it in a hazardous venture whose  outcome is uncertain. Furthermore, we must accustom ourselves to  the fact that this is in the nature of a winner-take-all system:  At least with regard to the coalition or party that is to  govern, it is the people who decide. If something does not  work, no recourse to bizarre parliamentary conjuring should  normally be permitted. Unless in the case of temporary  solutions, the only way to obviate this kind of problem is to  hold another election.    The left-wing and center forces must understand the  fundamental significance of the electoral law that they  themselves desired: It must be the voters, the people, who  decide not only on the balance of forces in Parliament, but also  who should occupy the government seats and who should occupy the  opposition seats. The only opportunity to try to reverse the  situation is through an election.    Does this mean that from now on all that the Left and the  Center can do in Parliament is to perform a mere supervisory  role? And that it is of no consequence that the opposition  forces in the Senate are stronger (numerically) than those of  the government? Not at all. But this advantage must be used  wisely, on issues of vital importance over which they are  prepared to face an electoral challenge in the near future.    Thus the period in which the government coalition was able  to  consider it a right that the Senate grant it the majority that  it lacksr came to an end yesterday. Now they will have to earn  anything more. And bland reassurances will not be enough.    With regard to the promises made during the election  campaign, there is not much to be said: The voters will judge  whether or not they have been honored. However, there is  something to be said with regard to two or three other matters.    First, the separation between Berlusconi the businessman (in  the media field, moreover) and Berlusconi the politician.  Agreed, as he himself said, the entire country will be watching  him. But that is not enough. The prime minister must consider  it his obligation to make it known soon whether, and if so how  and within what timeframe he intends to separate the businessman  from the politician.    Second, the presence of postfascist ministers and under  secretaries in the government. As we have already said, we do  not believe that a restoration of the Mussolini regime is under  way in Italy. Not even in a more modern guise, better suited to  the approach of the year 2000. But Berlusconi and even  [National Alliance leader] Fini can do much more to make it  clear to the country, and above all to the rest of the world,  that fascism is not only something which died 50 years ago and  about which everyone has his own opinions. Antitotalitarian  values, which Mr. Fini, too, says he has espoused, must be truly  alive. There must be no more little mistakes, gaffes, ambiguous  remarks: We cannot permit ourselves for a single moment to  yield to the "new apathy" that we have been obliged to condemn  several times recently in these columns.    Last, there is the issue of guarantees -- and for the moment  we will confine ourselves to consider those affecting parliament  -- for those who are not part of this majority. Here too, so  far there have been errors, gaffes, and rash remarks. Very  well, we want to know as soon as possible the names of the  committee chairmen on which the government majority has the  final say and the other public appointments with respect to  which the winners of the elections will be foregoing the  practice of military occupation. Let this be clear: Nobody  wants new forms of associationism, horse trading, and confusion  between winners and losers in the 27 March elections. But since  it is the custom in all civilized countries that the opposition  forces can enjoy means of control, it is time for the government  to make absolutely clear which posts it intends to grant to its  adversaries and which to independents (chosen jointly with the  opposition) providing guarantees of impartial conduct.    These three are only a few issues, but they are crucial  ones.  We hope that the opposition too will concentrate on them in a  concrete and constructive manner. This means abandoning the  pointless and wasteful daily lamentations in which it has  recently tried in vain to drown its post-electoral  disappointment.</p>

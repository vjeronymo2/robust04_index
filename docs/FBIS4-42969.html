			<p>BFN     [Text] UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali has  suggested that the UNFICYP [UN Forces in Cyprus] mandate be  renewed for another six months. In his report, which circulated  tonight, the UN secretary general mentions that UNFICYP's  presence is still necessary to achieve the Security Council's  goals.    The Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation correspondent reports  from New York that the UN secretary general is concerned with  the lack of progress in the reduction of troops and armaments in  Cyprus. He blames the Turkish side for the fact that talks have  not begun on disarmament in Cyprus and on prohibition of using  arms along the buffer zone other than sidearms. Butrus-Ghali  also mentions that concern for the lack of progress in this  sector intensifies if one considers the lack of political will  that was apparent in the latest efforts to agree on the  confidence-building measures.    The UN secretary general adds in his report that he has  informed Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller of President  Glavkos Kliridhis' demilitarization proposal. Butrus-Ghali says  that the Turkish Government replied that the Turkish Cypriot  community is the appropriate party to decide on that proposal.  He also mentions that military equipment on both sides in  Cyprus has been upgraded and that the number of Turkish troops  on the island has risen to 30,000. The UN peacekeeping force in  Cyprus numbers 1,250 men, 110 less than the number provided for.</p>

He said that the "big  fish" of the drug dealing business, who were facing legal  charges in the U. S. or other countries, would first have to  complete all legal procedures in Pakistani courts, and, if found  guilty as charged, these individuals would then be handed over  to face court trials in other countries. He said that Pakistan  had bilateral agreements with other countries under which  Pakistan would have to extradite to these countries individuals  who had committed crimes there. He said that the present  government had no intention of shirking its international  responsibilities. [passage omitted]</p>

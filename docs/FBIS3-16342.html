Vladislav Ardzinba, the leader of the autonomy,  says that the decision is due to the fact that the Georgian  Supreme Council -- quite illegally, in his opinion -- has  declared the supreme legislative body of the former autonomous  republic disbanded.    [Ardzinba] "The Law on State Power in the Republic of  Georgia, to which the Georgian Supreme Council refers as the  legal foundation for its decision, was adopted unilaterally  after the state and legal relations between Abkhazia and Georgia  were terminated. In view of this, it cannot apply to events  taking place on the territory of the Republic of Abkhazia."    [Announcer] This is how Valeriy Advadze, the Georgian  ambassador to Moscow, commented on Ardzinba's statement at our  request.    [Advadze] "This unilateral decision -- well, it is being  applied to Abkhazia and the Supreme Soviet of Abkhazia that was  elected on the basis of a discriminatory law when 17 to 18  percent of the electorate had 28 seats in parliament, whereas 50  percent of the Georgian population had 26 seats. I do not think  another such discriminative law exists anywhere in the world --  this is simply impossible. Therefore, the fact that this law  was made invalid, together with the Supreme Soviet elected on  the basis of this law, is simply a belated measure. It should  not have been adopted in the first place, or it should have been  removed earlier."    [Announcer] I would like to point out, however, that  Georgian  leader Eduard Shevardnadze considers the decision of the  Georgian Supreme Council to disband the Abkhazian Supreme Soviet  a rash measure.    Also today, Vladislav Ardzinba spoke sharply against the UN  peacekeeping troops being introduced in the republic without the  consent of the Abkhazian [Ardzinba] "If these troops are  introduced throughout the territory of Abkhazia in the interest  of the Georgian side, we will regard this as occupation, as an  attempt to occupy the territory of Abkhazia, with all the  ensuing consequences. I do not think there is any need to say  anything else."    [Announcer] Valeriy Advadze, the Georgian ambassador to  Moscow, comments again.    [Advadze] "The peacekeeping troops, if they do come, should  be deployed on the entire territory of Abkhazia so as to insure  that the residents who fled from there, the refugees, can return  and to guarantee a normal life and safety for them when they  return. It cannot be otherwise."    [Announcer] This evening the Russian Foreign Ministry  expressed its concern over the developments in Abkhazia and the  emergence of a real threat of armed clashes.</p>

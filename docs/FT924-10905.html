			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Shares firm after speculative session TENSIONS regarding the timing of the next cut in domestic interest rates tightened in the UK stock market yesterday morning, bringing an effective rejection from the Bank of England of rumours of an impending two-point reduction in its minimum lending rate. The rumours appeared to be founded on an early fall in sterling, which was interpreted as an indication of a flight from the currency ahead of rate cuts. Share prices opened uncertainly, helped at first by overnight firmness in the New York market. But with investment interest still thin - Monday's retail business was worth only Pounds 773.1m - equities resumed their downward drift and the FT-SE Index was 20 points off when the December stock index futures jumped sharply as the interest rate rumours reached the equity sector. The rumours were remarkably explicit, claiming that the UK base rates would be cut by two points before the end of the day, and without waiting for the policy speech in the City of London tomorrow from Mr Norman Lamont, chancellor of the exchequer. The stock market turned round sharply, advancing to a gain of 16.4 on the Footsie, although most of the buying came from marketmakers anxious not to be caught on the wrong foot again. But the Bank of England took action in the Treasury bill markets, which was seen to rule out a base rate move during yesterday's trading session. Equities quickly topped off, although London was sustained later by news of unexpected 2.7 per cent growth in the third quarter's Gross Domestic Product in the US. The final reading of 2,669.8 on the FT-SE Index showed a net gain reduced to 8.2 points. When the dust had settled, equity traders admitted that the sudden wave of base rate speculation had changed little in terms of market perceptions. Many strategists believe that the next cut in base rates may be held back until the government's autumn economic statement, due on November 12. But an earlier move is not ruled out by a stock market aware of the political pressures bearing down on the government's economic strategy. 'If we don't get the rate cut this week, then perhaps it will be next week,' said one trader resignedly. The speculative excitement boosted Seaq turnover to 550m shares yesterday, compared with 456.3m on Monday. Once again, the institutions showed interest in the second-line issues and remained selective in their purchases of Footsie stocks. The investment background remained gloomy, with the latest quarterly survey from the Confederation of British Industry indicating continued pessimism. There were further reports of staff cutbacks among the big London-based securities firms where, despite the increase in equity business over the past two months, profitability is still a serious problem. Complaints that the existing securities trading system in London is undermining the marketmaking function have revived, together with predictions that some form of order-driven system could begin to evolve if changes are not made soon.</p>

			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / EC pact may trigger air fares cuts AIRLINES WILL come under growing pressure to cut air fares within Europe after transport ministers last night agreed on a radical 'open skies' programme which removes government restrictions on air travel within the Community. Under the agreement, airlines will be allowed to set air fares as they wish from next year, injecting more competition into the market as all EC airlines gain access to routes dominated by national flag carriers. Earlier, more modest, packages, introduced in 1987 and 1990, failed to cut air fares. The European Commission hopes this 'Third Aviation Package' will succeed where the others failed. EC Transport Commissioner Karel Van Miert predicted last night: 'This package should now lead to lower air fares.' The UK government said last night that the deal, which secured 'the vast majority' of what it was seeking, would bring 'massive' opportunities for British airlines. It would bring about 'significant and noticeable' changes and after ten years of negotiation, it was 'a great achievement'. Transport Secretary John MacGregor said: 'This final clincher after two earlier interim air packages represents a real opening up of the European skies to competition.' On the likely effect on prices, Mr MacGregor said: 'Our agreement has put in place all the right mechanisms. The market will do the rest.' Mr John Parr, director general of the Air Transport Users' Committee, warned that passengers might have to wait for any big fare reductions. 'You only have to look at the financial results of airlines to see that they cannot afford to cut fares,' he said. Virgin Atlantic chairman Richard Branson said that he saw the agreement eventually leading to his airline being able to set up operations in France, Italy and Germany to 'provide the sort of low long-haul fares that Britons enjoy but Europeans don't'. For example, two routes he would be interested in operating would be Frankfurt to Orlando, Florida, and Paris to Tokyo. Final agreement was delayed until last-minute differences over the pace of improving market access were sorted out. France and the southern EC member states wanted a longer transition period while the air transport liberals - the UK, Netherlands, Ireland and Denmark - wanted a faster move to a free market. The freedom to set air tariffs will be limited by safeguards against 'predatory pricing', by which large carriers take temporary losses through unrealistic price cuts designed to force out smaller competitors. Market access will include, from next year, the right of EC-registered airlines to so-called 'seventh freedom' and what are known as 'consecutive cabotage' flights within the Community. Seventh freedom rights will, for example, allow British Airways to compete on a route between two countries which begins in, say, Paris and ends in Berlin. At present they are obliged to start or end at a British airport. 'Consecutive cabotage' means BA could offer services within one country, for instance between Paris and Marseilles or Berlin and Frankfurt, if the flight originated in the UK. Ministers agreed on a transition period of four years and three months for untramelled cabotage - the right to ply any other member state's internal routes without conditions. A final element in the third package sets common air licensing rules - governing technical fitness and capital adequacy - intended to facilitate new airlines entering the industry. Current national licensing systems tend to reinforce national monopolies. The Commission's highly contested proposals to loosen flag carriers' stranglehold on landing and take-off slots at hub airports are being kept held out of the package for later negotiation.

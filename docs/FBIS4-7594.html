			<p>BFN     [Text] Zoran Djindjic, president of the Democratic Party,  today held a news conference. Srdjan Savic reports:    [Savic] The Serbs in the Srpska republic were absolutely  correct when they decided not to join the Croatian-Muslim  federation, because when, in the second stage, a confederation  with Croatia is established, the border would be on the Drina  river. This is the view of the Democratic Party. The  international community has shown discernment for the  middle-of-the-road solution that could lead to peace. However,  the lifting of sanctions against Yugoslavia would very shortly  demotivate extreme circles among Croats and Muslims, and this  would be more effective than the peace talks, Djindjic said. The  next move should be the recognition of the equal status of the  Serbian Republic, and the issue of the final demarcation would  be settled later. The leader of the Democrats has endorsed the  negotiations between the representatives of the republic of  Serbian Krajina and Croatia in Zagreb, stressing that the  territorial status quo should be accepted and that more emphasis  should be placed on the undisputed points. Zoran Djindjic said  that a Democratic Party delegation will visit Russia between 4  and 7 April to explain the national position of Serbs in  discussions with the representatives of the state Duma and the  democratically orientated parties. Commenting on the situation  in our country, Djindjic said that the program of economic  stabilization is entering the second stage, that the first stage  has resulted in healthy currency and that the dinar will  collapse in its contact with the ailing economy without an  effective control of business activities.</p>

			<p><P> June 30, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNIST PARTY PUTS DIFFERENCES ASIDE, VOTES TO APPROVE GORBACHEV'S REFORMS;  </P> <P> SOVIET UNION: CONSERVATIVES AGREE TO WITHHOLD THEIR DISSENT AS CRUCIAL CONGRESS  DRAWS NEAR.  </P> <P> The Soviet Communist Party, putting aside its sharp differences for the moment,  voted Friday to approve without dissent the proposals that President Mikhail S.  Gorbachev will present to a crucial party congress next week for further  political and economic reforms.  </P> <P> The party's policy-making Central Committee also endorsed for presentation to  the congress a new party platform and plans for the party's reorganization,  both of which Gorbachev has sought to recover the lost momentum of perestroika,  as his reform program is known.  </P> <P> The congress will open Monday, as scheduled, despite suggestions this week that  it be postponed to allow Gorbachev's supporters to recover from a harsh,  all-out attack on perestroika at a party conference earlier this month.  </P> <P> Gorbachev, who outlined to the committee the main points of his report,  stressed the need to consolidate the increasingly divided party as well as to  press ahead with the reforms, a party spokesman said after the Kremlin meeting.  </P> <P> Describing the discussion of Gorbachev's report as "constructive and cordial,"  Alexander S. Kapto, the head of the Central Committee's ideology department,  implied that the fierce political infighting of recent weeks had been suspended  so that the party could proceed with the congress and the full-fledged debate  that will decide the nation's course.  </P> <P> But Boris N. Yeltsin, the president of Russia, the largest Soviet republic,  said Gorbachev had indeed come under strong criticism for the proposals he will  make in the report.  </P> <P> "There were remarks about the report, and very serious ones at that," Yeltsin,  a Central Committee member, said in an interview on the main nightly news  program, "Vremya." "But our real arguments are ahead of us."  </P> <P> The committee left unresolved the highly contentious issue of the future  structure of the party leadership.  </P> <P> Although Kapto suggested a consensus had emerged that the party leader should  also be the country's president, combining the powers in the hands of one  person, he acknowledged that doubts remain about this and about Gorbachev's  proposal to transform his present post as the party's general secretary into a  new position, party chairman, and thus free himself of many small issues.  </P> <P> Yegor K. Ligachev, the foremost conservative within the Soviet leadership,  declared in an interview published here Friday that he had "absolute  confidence" in Gorbachev's authority, notwithstanding his recent criticism of  Gorbachev's policies and his call this month for a division of the presidency  and the party leadership.  </P> <P> The party congress must focus on the fate of the nation and the party rather  than individuals, Ligachev told the newspaper Workers' Tribune.  </P> <P> Fears persist among Soviet liberals that, with the strong conservative trend in  many sections of the party, Gorbachev will have to battle to protect, let alone  promote, his reform program.  </P> <P> In a sharply worded commentary, a political analyst for the official news  agency Tass warned Friday that Gorbachev and his supporters must receive "the  party's mandate to deepen reforms" if the party and the country as a whole are  to emerge from a deepening series of crises.  </P> <P> "A lapse or a deliberate rejection of perestroika would be fraught with  disaster -- and not for the party alone," analyst Andrei Orlov wrote.  </P> <P> Although the party itself had chosen Gorbachev as its leader five years ago and  then launched the reform process, it has lost much of its drive, Orlov said in  an unusually critical assessment.  </P> <P> "There is an obvious discrepancy between the correct decisions and the open  resistance to reforms on the part of some party functionaries, who are  increasingly aware of the real challenge to their once-undisputed power," Orlov  said.  </P> <P> "This leads to a fall in the party's prestige and disappointment of its  numerous rank-and-file members," he added. "Ever more people are leaving the  party. Criticism is becoming sharper of its role as a force responsible for the  economic, social, ethnic and, indeed, political crisis in society."  </P> <P> Kapto said that, after the debate on Gorbachev's report, the 249-member  committee had told the ruling Politburo to "rework it to take into account the  discussion," but this was largely to make sections of it more specific.  </P> <P> The biggest change, ironically, was in the name. Originally, Gorbachev's report  was entitled "The Course of Perestroika and the Party's Tasks -- Report of the  Central Committee." At the insistence of committee members, it was changed to  "Political Report of the Central Committee to the 28th Party Congress and the  Party's Tasks."  </P> <P> The committee appeared to be distancing itself from Gorbachev's proposals and  sticking to a traditional formula for the general secretary's reports to the  party.  </P> <P> But Gorbachev was also asked to make "a political assessment" of the Russian  Communist Party's recent congress, which demonstrated the growing strength of  the party's resurgent conservative wing. That is certain to set the scene for a  political donnybrook since conservatives may well hold half or even more of the  seats at the congress.  </P> <P> The Russian party's stand was so conservative that dozens of Communist Party  organizations around Russia are refusing to become, automatically, members of  the Russian Communist Party, and they are demanding that they be allowed to  retain their positions in the Soviet Communist Party.  </P> <P> The Russian congress and, to a lesser extent, that of the Ukrainian Communist  Party developed into an unprecedented onslaught against Gorbachev and  perestroika earlier this month, and that prompted Gorbachev supporters to  consider postponing the national party congress until the autumn, in an attempt  to slow the conservatives' momentum.  </P> <P> Kapto said, however, that the Central Committee had confirmed the opening of  the congress on Monday and that there had been no discussion of delaying it.  Originally planned for a week, the congress is now likely to run at least 10  days, Kapto added.  </P> <P> The congress will draw 4,683 elected delegates from around the country, plus  350 representatives of workers and farmers, who are now vastly outnumbered by  party and government officials.  </P> <P> The committee also discussed a threat by miners at 25 mines around the country  to strike on July 11, just as the congress is finishing, unless the party and  Soviet authorities meet their demands for independent trade unions and the  removal of the party officials who control the army, the police, the judiciary  and the school system.  </P> <P> A look at the issues, prospects and players at the party congress.

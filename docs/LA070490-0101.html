			<p><P> July 4, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> US Sprint, MCI Seek Continued Regulation of AT&amp;T: The two rivals asked the  Federal Communications Commission to continue regulating American Telephone  &amp; Telegraph Co., which they charged with dominating the telecommunications  market. For its part, AT&amp;T told the FCC that because the long-distance  market is "vigorously competitive," it is time for the same rules to apply to  all long-distance companies. The FCC proposed in March to deregulate some  segments of AT&amp;T's business and asked for comments from the other  telecommunications companies, which were presented Tuesday.  </P></p>

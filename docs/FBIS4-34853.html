			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National Radio News"] </F>   [Text] Omar Morales, a Foreign Ministry specialist, has  told PRENSA LATINA that plans to form the Association of  Caribbean States, ACS, reflect the spirit of convergence among  today's approaches to Latin American integration. Morales said  this is very healthy for the hemisphere because it opens the way  to a degree of economic unity that will put the hemisphere in a  more advantageous position to negotiate with other regional  groups in the world.    The ACS will include three regional blocs: the Caribbean  Common Market, CARICOM; the Secretariat of Central American  Economic Integration, SIECA; and the G-3, which includes Mexico,  Venezuela, and Colombia. Morales also said that heads of state  of the member countries will meet in the Barbadian capital on 4  July to establish the ACS, an intergovernmental organization for  regional teamwork, consultation, and cooperation.</p>

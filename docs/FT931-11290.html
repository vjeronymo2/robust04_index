			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Rifkind reprieves 3,000 jobs in army about-face THE GOVERNMENT yesterday sought to head off growing pressure to reverse army cuts by announcing the reprieve of 3,000 uniformed jobs and the cancellation of two regimental mergers. The army, now about 145,000-strong, will be reduced to 119,000 instead of the controversial 116,000 target set by the government in 1991. But Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, said in a Commons statement that the size of the armed forces should not be permanently fixed. He promised to keep army strength 'under close review in the light of changing circumstances'. The surprise change of mind by the government appeared calculated to take the wind out of the sails of the Commons defence committee, which is to publish a highly critical report next week calling for the army cuts to be frozen while requirements are reconsidered. Officials, however, said adjustments to the 1991 plans had been under consideration for some months. The Ministry of Defence will have to find savings of Pounds 80m in other areas of its budget to meet the annual cost of the change in manpower plans. Sir Nicholas Bonsor, the defence committee's Conservative chairman, welcomed the changes, although next week's report would call for 'substantially more'. He said the government should be prepared to raise numbers further if UN requirements increased. Mr David Clark, Labour's def-ence spokesman, described the changes as 'panic measures' and said they reflected the lack of a national strategy for defence. The announcement that four infantry regiments would be saved from amalgamating into two were greeted with loud cheers from MPs. The Cheshire Regiment, now in central Bosnia, was due to merge with the Staffordshire Regiment in September, and the Royal Scots, the oldest 'line' regiment in the army, was set to join with the King's Own Scottish Borderers in October next year. The army will be left with 40 infantry battalions instead of the 38 previously planned. Until recently there were 55. The reprieve will also allow other units to be brought up to strength. Mr Rifkind said the streamlining of support services and the hiving off of some activities should release a further 2,000 personnel for front-line units. Reorganisation has meant the gap between emergency tours of duty in Northern Ireland or overseas is down to about 15 months. Mr Rifkind said the measures would increase the interval to 17 months this year, and eventually it would be more than the previous target of 24 months.</p>

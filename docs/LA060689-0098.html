			<p><P> June 6, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAMILY PLANNING FUND BATTLE PRESSED  </P> <P> With a new fiscal year rapidly approaching and Gov. George Deukmejian holding  fast to his threat to eliminate funding for the state's family planning  program, local family planning officials Monday stepped up their campaign to  keep the program's multimillion-dollar budget intact.  </P> <P> Stacks of postcards pre-addressed to the governor awaited patients visiting  T.H.E. Clinic for Women in South Los Angeles, where officials gathered to  protest the proposed budget cuts that would eliminate the state's Office of  Family Planning and the $36.2 million it distributes to more than 170 clinics  in the state.  </P> <P> "We're concerned that he virtually re-funded every program he'd cut back with  the exception of (ours). . . . That's the urgency," said Thomas C. Kring,  executive director of the Los Angeles Regional Family Planning Council, which  is participating in a statewide letter-writing campaign to Deukmejian. "We're  the only one that he's totally eliminated, and that's scary as hell."  </P> <P> Kring was referring to the governor's announcement Thursday to fund several  health and welfare programs that he had previously marked for substantial cuts.  The funding restoration was attributed to the discovery of a $2.5-billion state  surplus.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not Included  </P> <P> However, the state family planning program was not included in the governor's  proposal. Kring said the effects of the cuts, which could cause the closure of  more than half of the 82 clinics subsidized by the state, are already being  felt as staff members leave and patients stop coming to clinics that they  believe may soon close.  </P> <P> The clinics provide a wide range of medical services ranging from pre-natal  care to AIDS testing.  </P> <P> "Basically, we're being held hostage," said Kring, who believes that the  governor is using the clinics' funding as a bargaining chip for his other  budgetary goals. "And when I say we, I'm talking about low-income women . . .  the poorest of the poor receiving care through these programs."  </P> <P> Though family planning services get some federal funding and private donations,  officials estimate that more than half of the county clinics subsidized by the  program would have to close if the $9.4 million they now receive is eliminated.  The cut would affect more than 100,000 clients, according to Kring, many of  whom are newly arrived immigrants with no access to welfare programs.  </P> <P> Without the state subsidized services, most of the women will go without  medical care, according to clinic directors.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Insurance  </P> <P> "They will be dying," said Catherine Wiley, who runs four comprehensive health  care clinics in Los Angeles. "They do not have health insurance, they do not  have money and most don't have Medi-Cal. . . . There's no other place for them  to go."  </P> <P> Southern California family planning officials plan to hand deliver nearly  30,000 postcards to the governor's Los Angeles office June 15, asking him to  restore the program's funding, Kring said. He added that a similar delivery  will be made to Sacramento sometime this month, in the last days before a new  fiscal year begins July 1.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Drive Began in February  </P> <P> The letter-writing campaign, coordinated by the California Reproductive Health  Assn., began in late February, officials said.  </P> <P> Tom Beermann of the governor's Sacramento office said Deukmejian had received  thousands of letters and cards concerning the family planning issue. But he  added that whether such funding will be a part of the budget is "the subject of  negotiations between the governor and the legislative leadership."  </P></p>

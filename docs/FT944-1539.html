			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Nigeria pays the price of instability: Disenchanted companies are looking elsewhere to invest Ever since Nigeria's military regime detailed its economic policies in January 1994, it has received blunt warnings of economic decline and disinvestment from Nigeria's private sector. A survey of British business experiences in emerging markets, published yesterday by Control Risks Group, underlines this message. The survey shows the ratio of opportunity against risk in Nigeria as minus 4.5, whilst Africa as a whole receives a positive ratio of 2.5. Nigeria's advantages over most of the African continent  - the largest domestic market in Africa, its dominance in the manufacturing and oil and gas sectors in west Africa and its agricultural potential  - are being eroded as disadvantages rise. Many problems stem from political instability. In 1993 and 1994, industry lost nearly two months' business because of political strikes which brought fuel supplies and transport almost to a halt, and closed ports, banks and offices. In July and August this year, the strikes hit multinational oil producers as the unions damaged equipment and threatened staff who continued to work. The manoeuvring by the military to retain power has eroded policymaking which is either on hold, non-existent or liable to sudden U-turns. The most damaging of these was the imposition of foreign exchange controls this year which stopped several planned investments in agriculture and agro-industry by multinationals. High inflation, low productivity and currency devaluation have hit spending power and depressed local demand while ill-conceived macro-economic policies have aggravated restrictions on investment. The limit of 40 per cent foreign ownership in the main sectors of the economy, including, oil and gas production, banking and manufacturing industry, deprives multinationals of control. Nigeria has missed out on the interest in emerging markets funds and has been left behind by neighbouring Ghana's newer and smaller stock exchange. Payment uncertainties are an old problem for contractors and suppliers in Nigeria and now affect most sectors of industry. The failure of the state oil company, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, to pay its 60 per cent share of the operating costs in its joint ventures with the international oil companies forced Shell to declare NNPC in default. The oil majors have warned that unless the government improves its funding or reduces its equity, more default notices will follow next year and production will decline. Another difficulty is fraud. International companies have become a prime target for embezzlement, false invoicing and counterfeit documents, notes and even fake drugs. Armed robbery and street crime, and the corruption and inefficiency of the police force, make extra security essential to protect homes, offices and vehicles. Several large companies employ and equip local police units to get the service they require. At Lagos airport customs officials try to extort money, and touts deceive, abduct and rob visitors on arrival. Bureaucratic corruption pervadesall levels. These problems are less discouraging when companies are making sizeable profits. But if Nigeria's economy continues its downward slide, the negative factors will add to the reasons why Nigerian and international businesses are looking elsewhere to invest.</p>

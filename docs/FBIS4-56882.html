			<p>BFN     [Text] Guatemala City, 7 May (ACAN-EFE) -- Guatemalan  President Ramiro de Leon Carpio today appointed lawyers Acisclo  Valladares as the new attorney general and Ranses Cuestas as the  new prosecutor general. Valladares is reassuming the post he  held during the government of overthrown President Jorge Serrano  (1991-1993).    Before swearing in the new officials, President de Leon  Carpio explained that the new attorney general will serve as an  adviser and consultant to state institutions.    Valladares left office in 1993 after being suspended. At  that time the courts charged that Valladares had refrained from  bringing fraud charges against his brother Luis Domingo  Valladares.    Presidency sources told ACAN-EFE that Cuestas, a lawyer with  30 years experience, has never held a public office.    Valladares and Cuestas will assume the offices Telesforo  Guerra Cahn held simultaneously. The attorney general was  chosen directly by the president while the prosecutor general  was chosen from among six candidates presented by a nominating  committee headed by the Supreme Court of Justice.</p>

The central  issue was Bosnia and Russia's new position regarding the drama  in the Balkans. Here is a report from Giuseppe De Carli:    [De Carli] This was a strictly private meeting without  speeches or official communiques, but the arrival at the Vatican  of the rising star of the Yeltsin government, Viktor  Chernomyrdin, was far from routine. John Paul II wanted to find  out about the new Russian prime minister's intentions and, above  all, to jointly evaluate the position to be taken with regard to  the drama in Bosnia.    Here, we must say, the Vatican and Russia have positions  that  are far apart and, in some respects, irreconcilable. In the  last few weeks, the governments of the West have learned that  Russia is against any use of force. Yeltsin has asked for the  Security Council to be convened and has insisted on a political  solution to the crisis in the Balkans. The chief cause for  concern is Russia's pro-Serbian line. It is no longer West  against East, but the Christian world against the Muslim world.    This is not the Pope's position. He is desperately trying to  build bridges between Christians and Muslims in order to find  common grounds for tolerance. The Vatican is particularly  concerned about the mood of Islamic nations angrily watching  Europe's indifference towards the massacre of Bosnian Moslems.  John Paul II once again told Chernomyrdin that after the  collapse of the walls, it is absurd to be building new ones  using the spur of nationalism and conflicting religious beliefs.  According to official sources, the Russian prime minister  listened attentively and was receptive to this line of reasoning.</p>

			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / UK Company News: PowerGen confirms share buy-back plan PowerGen has confirmed that it will buy back a portion of its shares when the government offers its 40 per cent stake in the power generators for sale early next year. The move had been expected following National Power's announcement last month that it would buy up to 8 per cent of its shares from the government. PowerGen will buy a similar proportion, worth about Pounds 322m at Monday's prices. However, the government will be able to claw back up to 1.5 per cent to meet demand from investors in the public offer. PowerGen will cancel the shares, thereby enhancing earnings per share by 2.5 to 3.5 per cent. The move will also take the group a step closer to its goal of reducing dividend cover to 2.5 from 2.7 times earnings. The group said yesterday that the purchase would be financed from existing facilities and anticipated cash flows. However, it is likely that year-end gearing will only be slightly above last year's 15 per cent because other borrowings have decreased. Existing investment plans and further share repurchases would not be affected. See Capital Markets</p>

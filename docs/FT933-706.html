			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Labour at Brighton: Support for scrapping of opt-out schools CONFERENCE yesterday supported a motion to end school opt-outs and the creation of grant-maintained schools. It also called for nursery education to be available by right to all children from the age of four and for financial support for all students over 16 in full or part-time education. Mr Graham Lane of the Socialist Education Association, who proposed the motion, accused the government of 'bribery and corruption' in its eff-orts to encourage schools to opt out. Delegates expressed their contempt for the government's education reforms during a debate in which Ms Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, said Labour offered a vision of a learning society where education was not geared to a privileged minority, 'but where all individuals are empowered to make real decisions about their own lives'. Ms Taylor said that the party rejected the 'simplistic, meaningless and dangerous league tables' which were designed with the purpose of setting schools against each other. She also urged reform to post-16 education. 'Conservatives describe A-levels as a gold standard,' she said. 'Well, it's pretty tarnished gold and it's just not good enough for today's children, forcing them to make invidious, narrow and out-of-date choices.' Mrs Glenys Kinnock, prospective European parliamentary candidate for South East Wales and wife of the former Labour leader, condemned government plans for a 'mum's army' of teachers for the youngest primary school children, dismissing the idea as 'crackpot'. 'Teachers are not insisting on an all-graduate profession because of vested interests,' she said. 'It is children's interests that they are seeking to defend.' Later in the debate Mr Nicholas Russell of the Morecambe and Lunesdale constituency party complained about government plans to reform student unions which he said would limit the activities the unions could be involved in.</p>

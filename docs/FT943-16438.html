			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Warrants issued in for Venezuelan drug firm executives A criminal court judge has issued arrest warrants against executives at eight pharmaceutical companies in Venezuela for alleged fraud in product pricing, writes Joseph Mann. Executives, some of them foreigners, from subsidiaries of four international companies, Ciba-Geigy, Rhone-Poulenc, Sandoz and Servier, were among those cited. According to Judge Cristobal Ramirez, the eight companies supplied 'padded' price lists when the previous administration was preparing price controls. One drug company executive said the judge's decision was based on a 'misunderstanding' and could be clarified. News of the warrants came as the government seeks to convince private companies they should feel confident about investing in Venezuela.</p>

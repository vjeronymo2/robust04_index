			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Four jailed over park fraud FOUR MEN were jailed and another was fined yesterday over the 1985 collapse of the Britannia theme park at Shipley, near Heanor in Derbyshire, with debts of Pounds 9.34m. At 17 months it was the UK's longest criminal trial. Mr Peter Kellard, who controlled the company that built the theme park, was jailed for four years and disqualified as a director for five years after being found guilty earlier this week of 19 fraud charges. The case covered charges of fraudulent trading, theft, deceit in order to obtain bank loans and project finance, and the shuffling around of assets to keep them out of the hands of a receiver and to provide funds for the directors of KLF (UK), Mr Kellard's company, and its subsidiaries. The jury at Nottingham Crown Court heard 158 prosecution witnesses and 28 defence witnesses and took seven days to decide its verdicts. Mr Kellard gave evidence for 29 days. The offences took place between 1980, shortly after KLF negotiated a lease with Derbyshire County Council for the theme-park site, and September 1985, when Samuel Montagu, the merchant bank which provided Pounds 3.7m of project finance, called in Cork Gully as receiver. In addition to Samuel Montagu there were 608 creditors, of which 203 were Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire businesses owed up to Pounds 20,000 each. Britannia Park was open in a half-finished state for three months before Cork Gully was called in. Derbyshire police became involved in July 1986. It was the largest fraud inquiry the force had undertaken and it cost nearly Pounds 2m. The first arrests were made in 1987. The Crown Prosecution Service said yesterday that its costs - fees for counsel and other legal expenses but excluding staff costs - had come to Pounds 1m. The trial started in September 1990 with six defendants, one of whom, Mr Keith Emmett, was cleared of the three charges he faced. In addition to Mr Kellard, three other directors of KLF or its subsidiaries were sentenced. Mr Edward Dwyer was jailed for 2 1/2 years and disqualified as a director for five years on six charges. Mr John Wright was jailed for six months and disqualified for three years on five charges. Mr Kenneth Page, who pleaded guilty at the start of the trial, was jailed for six months on five charges. Mr Saied Sobhkhiz, the managing director of Bournemouth-based Euro-per &amp; Gulf who changed his plea to guilty last year, was fined Pounds 7,500 and ordered to pay Pounds 25,000 costs on two charges. Cork Gully eventually sold Britannia Park to Derbyshire County Council for Pounds 2.5m. The park had been devised in the first place to honour British invention. Now it exists as the American Adventure Theme Park.</p>

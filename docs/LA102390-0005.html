			<p><P> October 23, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE'S ECONOMY  </P> <P> In response to "Can State No Longer Compete?" front page, Oct. 7:  </P> <P> Your article begins, "A soy sauce maker quits Los Angeles County and opens up  shop in Nevada. A Glendale fiber company shutters a 40-year-old factory and  heads for Colorado.  </P> <P> An Orange County auto parts firms plans it future over the border in Arizona."  </P> <P> Wonderful! We need to thin out the population in Southern California. The idea  that we must continue to expand, come hell or high water, will destroy us. The  fact that some small and large businesses move out of the state is not the  harbinger of doom for the state's economy. People will continue to come to the  Southland in droves, and people will go into business to serve them.  </P> <P> The problems arise from the need to provide the services and infrastructure to  serve those who are here and those who are to come. That is going to cost  money, and we cannot continue to amass bonded debt in this state without  increasing taxes to "pay as we go" and try to retire the debt. Stop! Tax and  spend, don't borrow and spend.  </P> <P> BRYAN W. STEVENS, Rolling Hills Estates  </P></p>

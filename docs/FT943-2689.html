			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Bupa's long view Bupa, the UK's largest private health insurer, is moving into the market for long-term health-related insurance. In the past, it sold insurance to cover only the direct cost of private medical treatment - not the impact of ill-health on financial circumstances. Now, it has added three new types of policy: Disability income insurance, which provides a replacement income if you cannot work through ill-health. Critical illness cover, which pays a substantial lump sum if you suffer one of a defined list of serious health problems, such as cancer, heart attack or stroke. Recovery cash, which pays a smaller lump sum if you need surgery, whether privately or on the NHS. One pertinent aspect of the disability income cover is that unlike similar products - usually known as permanent health insurance, or PHI  - cover does not stop at retirement age. Instead, it changes into a type of long-term insurance to help with the cost of care if you become unable to carry out such 'activities of daily living' as washing, going to the lavatory, and eating unaided. Claims before retirement are decided on whether your illness or disability stops you carrying out your normal occupation. So, a condition that allows you to claim then will not necessarily entitle you to post-retirement benefits. One drawback is that the policy must be taken out at least five years before your scheduled retirement date. This means that long-term care cover will not be available to those most likely to consider buying it: people on the verge of retirement or who have just retired. Another potential problem is that the maximum level of cover is only 50 per cent of your gross salary (most insurers offer cover of up to two-thirds). Since nursing homes are expensive - up to Pounds 20,000 a year - you could cover long-term care costs fully only if you were earning about Pounds 40,000 a year before retiring. The market for medical insurance, PHI and critical illness cover is large and competitive, so it is worth getting quotes for all the different elements from a range of insurers before signing up for a single insurer's package. At the same time, Bupa has simplified its range of private medical policies to reduce confusion over what is covered and make it easier for people to switch between different types of insurance when their circumstances change. Its new, customer-friendly approach includes a local-rate telephone help-line for customers, open from 8am to 8pm on weekdays. Another innovation is a range of voluntary excesses on all medical policies. This gives subscribers the choice of cutting premiums by up to 40 per cent by agreeing to pay the first Pounds 100 to Pounds 500 of every claim. This will appeal to people who find comprehensive premiums costly and are happy to have minor conditions treated on the NHS (or pay themselves) but still want cover for serious illness. Several other insurers offer voluntary excesses already.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Responding to a question by the Cyprus Broadcasting  Corporation correspondent, Greek Foreign Ministry Secretary  General Ioannis Kranidhiotis said the Greek Presidency's  proposal was for negotiations to begin and conclude before the  1996 intergovernment conference, and then Cyprus would join the  European Union [EU] after the conference.    Kranidhiotis said the proposal was removed during the  discussion. Objections were mainly raised by France, which wants  the institutional operational framework to be set first;  Germany, which links the issue with Turkey; and Britain, which  links the issue with progress in the Cyprus issue. The  secretary general added that what we have achieved is that the  next expansion phase will certainly include Cyprus and Malta.  He said what is more important is that Cyprus' accession is no  longer linked to developments in the Cyprus issue. He concluded  that the issue of beginning accession negotiations will be  raised many times before 1996 in order to achieve a commitment  for the beginning of negotiations.</p>

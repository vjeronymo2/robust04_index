Tsapoyas: "What Is Hidden Behind </F> Clinton's Recovery"]    [Text] U.S. President Bill Clinton confirmed the  predictions of those who had said that as governor of Arkansas  he made significant mistakes at first but later corrected them  and erased the negative picture he created.    A year after he took over the Presidency and saw his  popularity fall to the lowest point experienced by any U.S.  President in his first year, Clinton yesterday reached the other  end of the scale, with the most successful--even his opponents  described it thus-- State of the Union address. Even former  Vice President Dan Quayle predicted that Clinton would be U.S.  President for a second four-year term.    It was not Clinton's effort that caused the popular view to  change. It was the visible improvement of the economy, which  did not stem from Clinton's own actions. But Clinton managed to  disengage himself from his destructive involvement in issues  like Somalia, Yugoslavia, and Haiti. Recently, and for the  first time, Washington appeared to have acquired an organized  policy for the post-Cold War period, something that can be seen  in the results of Clinton's recent European tour. During the  tour, he avoided emphasizing foreign policy issues, knowing that  the Americans are only interested (usually negatively) when  their compatriots are involved.    In his address yesterday, Clinton was careful to give  international policy the position it deserves (according to the  U.S. popular view). It simply gave an assurance that a good  quality of life must be secured for Americans.    Clinton's choosing to emphasize the restructuring of  healthcare and combating crime was no accident; it proved to be  extremely successful. A day before his address, 39 percent of  Americans said they believed the White House priority should be  to combat crime, 35 percent asked that healthcare be  restructured, 14 percent asked that the budget deficit be  limited, and 11 percent wanted the social security system to be  restructured.</p>

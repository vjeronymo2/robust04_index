			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Management: Headhunters lead business down road to academe - The newest recruits to British universities A new breed is stalking the top branches of British higher education: the headhunted vice-chancellor. Professor Gerald Bernbaum, registrar of Leicester University, appointed today to succeed Baroness Pauline Perry as vice-chancellor of the new South Bank University, is among the first. It was Saxton Bampfylde, the executive recruitment agency, that attracted him south, and made him only the second head of a 'new' university (former polytechnic) to hail from one of the 'old' variety. 'I knew the job was up, but definitely wouldn't have applied without Saxton Bampfylde,' said Bernbaum, 56, who has spent the last six years masterminding Leicester's rapid expansion in student numbers. It was not fear of stepping into Baroness Perry's capacious shoes; still less ignorance of the polytechnic sector. 'I simply would not have thought it was the job for me; and without Saxton, there would have been no guarantee of speed and secrecy.' Bernbaum sets particular store by the latter. 'I had to have confidentiality until a very late stage to protect my position at Leicester; you simply don't get that by replying to a newspaper ad.' All his discussions were with Saxton until a late stage; it took only a few weeks from then to the appointment. As with most recruitment agencies, Saxton Bampfylde's bread and butter still comes from the City. But it sees education and the public sector as a growing business. The new head of the Office for Standards in Education, Professor Stewart Sutherland, is its most prominent catch. It has also been in on the selection of two heads of Oxford colleges, and it is pitching for other posts at vice-chancellor level. Saxton's services do not come cheap - around a third of the appointee's first-year salary plus expenses. But, says Gavin Mackenzie, a fellow of Jesus College, Cambridge, on secondment to Saxton as a consultant: 'This market is bound to grow further, especially as universities realise that it is not only career academics that make excellent vice-chancellors.' By implication, next time South Bank could end up with, say, the marketing manager of Unilever. In fact, it was prepared to this time: it wanted candidates from outside the university world, and its shortlist included private sector executives. One made it to the final shortlist of three. Why, then, are there so few higher education institutions with heads from outside academe? Senior civil servants and diplomats have long adorned Oxbridge lodgings; but Derek Roberts, deputy managing director of GEC until becoming provost of University College, London, in 1989, is almost alone in moving from a senior industrial post. Remuneration may have something to do with it. But of late the governing councils of the new universities have shown remarkable generosity to their vice-chancellors, despite the depressed state of academic pay generally. Nearly-three-figure salaries are now not uncommon. A more serious obstacle appears to be the cultural divide. Though headhunters have sometimes made a difference to the individual appointed, none of the universities or Oxbridge colleges employing them has yet gone for a type of person they would not have chosen on their own. 'It would have been too much of a leap in the dark to do otherwise  - and difficult to sell to colleagues,' says an academic close to one such appointment. All, however, is not bleak for the bored banker. Saxton Bampfylde has just been retained to find a new director general for the Royal Horticultural Society. Pounds 60,000 a year; car and benefits; interest in flowers desirable.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] Andrey Kozyrev and Nursultan Nazarbayev spent about  three hours in one-on-one talks yesterday. Trustworthy sources  say that an agreement was not reached on any of the subjects  under discussion. For this reason, no final documents were  signed. The issues obstructing relations between Russia and  Kazakhstan fall into three areas.    First, there are legal issues relating to citizenship and  the  rights of Russians in Kazakhstan. Nazarbayev once again said no  to Kozyrev's latest initiative on dual citizenship. The  possibility of a compromise is being discussed.    The second issue is military-political cooperation.  Kazakhstan is insisting on an economic quid pro quo for the  removal of nuclear weapons.    Third, and lastly, there is Baykonur, which is still a  stumbling block in relations between the two states. The plane  carrying the Russian foreign minister's delegation, accompanied  by Kazakh representatives, has just landed at Krayniy airport,  Leninsk.    Today, Andrey Kozyrev will familiarize himself with the  situation at Baykonur. The talks are proving difficult. The  Kazakh side does not agree that Russia should lease the  Cosmodrome for 99 years. According to some reports, Russia is  being offered a lease of about 20 years. Russia's Defense  Ministry regards this as completely unacceptable.    Furthermore, Kazakhstan is seeking the demilitarization of  Baykonur. It does not want to entrust command over it to the  Russian military authorities. Kazakhstan hopes to carry out a  global commercial program at the cosmodrome. Naturally, this  does not accord with Russia's strategic interests either.    Kazakhstan's latest bold condition for Russia's use of  Baykonur was the proposal that, in return for a lease on the  Cosmodrome, it would receive military equipment from Russia at  half-price.    Finally, Kazakhstan has completely refused to recognize  Baykonur and a number of test ranges as Russian military bases,  something that Moscow is insisting on.    Nevertheless, we must set an example by proving that we can  conduct a fruitful dialogue, as well as argue and stake claims,  Andrey Kozyrev said, probably without feeling especially  hopeful, judging by the Kazakh side's recent behavior.</p>

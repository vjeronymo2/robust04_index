			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / International Company News: Alcatel-SEL to cut 5,300 jobs Alcatel-SEL, the German subsidiary of Alcatel Alsthom, the French telecommunications, transport and engineering group, yesterday announced restructuring measures in an attempt to stem losses which have shaken its parent company. The announcement coincided with another blow to Alcatel Alsthom. Mr Jean-Claude Leny, chairman of Framatome, revealed the French government had decided against the planned privatisation of the nuclear power-plant group. Alcatel Alsthom had lobbied hard to take control of the company, in which it has a 44 per cent stake. Alcatel-SEL plans to cut 5,300 jobs, almost one quarter of the workforce, by the end of 1995. Plants at Mannheim and Rochlitz are to close. The moves are aimed at curbing losses expected to total about DM300m (Dollars 199m) this year at the operating level. 'We are losing about DM1m a day,' said Mr Gerhard Zeidler, chairman of Alcatel-SEL. The company says provisions of DM200m to DM300m will be required to cover losses in 1994. A return to profit is not expected until 1996. The losses reflect difficulties faced by suppliers of telecommunications equipment in the German market. Orders from large clients such as Deutsche Telekom, the national telecoms operator, have fallen, while prices have been hit by increased competition. The deterioration in the market reflects structural problems, according to industry analysts. Telecoms investment in eastern Germany has slowed, while the shift by Deutsche Telekom to increase competition in the award of contracts has undermined traditional suppliers, such as Alcatel and Siemens.</p>

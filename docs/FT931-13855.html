			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: UK housing Yet again there is talk of a revival in the housing sector. Yet again investors run the risk of disappointment. Shares in building materials and construction companies have been pushed up firmly as expectations have grown. Both sectors have outperformed the market by around 20 per cent in the past three months. There seems little room for more. The good news is that the straws in the wind suggesting renewed activity in the housing market are rapidly turning into a small haystack. Housing showrooms and estate agencies have reportedly been buzzing with activity. Prices appear to have found a floor. Even the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors suggests the housing market is finally stabilising. But the evidence is still patchy. Repossessions and rising unemployment are likely to sap confidence for a while to come. Besides, any resurgence in the housing market will take time to feed through into profits for building materials companies and housebuilders. The biggest of them, such as Tarmac and Wimpey, appear too financially constrained to exploit any surge in demand for new houses. The purer players, such as Wilson Bowden, Berkeley and Bryant, are far more likely to benefit. But the market has hardly neglected their charms. Most are trading on historic multiples of around 20. That looks expensive when recovery will be protracted.</p>

			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Minister sans frontieres: Bernard Kouchner, head of France's humanitarian aid, talks to David Buchan and Alice Rawsthorn The French government's 53-year-old boy adventurer has done it again. Earlier this week Mr Bernard Kouchner, France's humanitarian aid minister, got 33 Bosnian Moslems prisoners freed in exchange for the same number of Serb prisoners. Some cynics carped that Mr Kouchner was just on another ego trip, while at the same time trying to save the face of Mr Roland Dumas, the French foreign minister who had rashly claimed that France would liberate the Bosnian POW camps by force, and by itself, if necessary. But in an interview just before he left for Bosnia, Mr Kouchner disclaimed any such tawdry political calculations. 'People are suffering in the (Bosnian) camps,' said France's modern-day Scarlet Pimpernel. For him, the moral obligation is to act, and act speedily. 'Don't wait, don't ask for clearance - just go,' is still his motto, he says. Mr Kouchner has proved impulsive in his five years as France's humanitarian aid minister, just as he was after 1971 when he established Medecins Sans Frontieres to spirit himself and other crusading French doctors across frontiers and battlelines into Biafra, Afghanistan, and Vietnam. This impulsiveness in a noble cause, combining the methods of a Tintin with the goals of Mother Teresa, has put Mr Kouchner at the top of the French opinion polls. He is clear why his brand of emergency aid has struck such a chord. 'It is direct, palpable . . . perhaps too superficial, but compared to the hackneyed way politicians describe the world it speaks to people, especially to the young . . . it seems to be more moral than traditional political approaches.' Above all, for western youth with dismal economic prospects at home, it is, says Mr Kouchner, 'a vision, a style, an adventure'. His method, he concedes, is far more gripping than long-term development aid, which tends to produce long-term results. He readily admits the need for 'le follow-up', for development aid, but it requires 'another kind of courage, perseverance'. He stresses that, in Somalia, he is already turning over some of his ministry's emergency aid money to development organisations to revive the economy, once US and French troops have re-established order. The other ingredient of Kouchnerism is the media. His partner happens to be Christine Ockrent, the doyenne of the new French breed of bright and beautiful television executives. Mr Kouchner is anything but camera-shy himself. Last month he overdid it, wading ashore in Somalia with a bag of rice on his back for the benefit of the massed cameras. He has long exploited the power of the small screen to excite compassion. Indeed, the reason some of his co-founders of Medecins Sans Frontieres parted company with him was that they thought he was wrapping efforts to rescue Vietnamese boat people in too much media-hype. He then founded Medecins du Monde, which has run a poster campaign in France likening Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian leader, to Adolf Hitler, a comparison which Mr Kouchner finds excessive. Yet, for Mr Kouchner, 'show-biz' is a vital part of whipping up and sustaining public support for humanitarian aid. European Community officials have been irritated at the way the French minister sometimes jets in, complete with TV camera crew, to take credit wherever EC relief aid is being delivered. And why not? he retorts. 'After all 23 per cent of all EC aid is paid for by France,' he says, adding condescendingly: 'I can understand why the people in Brussels do not know how to sell their aid - they are bureaucrats.' Almost as despicable a term, for Mr Kouchner, is the word 'establishment'. Yet, he has had a big influence on it. He has become the favourite of President Mitterrand's waning years in office. This is partly because he has a soulmate in Danielle, the president's wife, with whom he has visited Kurdish refugees in Iraq. But Mr Mitterrand also sees him as the one bright spot in a Socialist administration heavily tarnished by scandal. So the president has increasingly given Mr Kouchner his head. In sending troops to Somalia last month, the president sided with his aid minister, and against Mr Pierre Joxe, his defence minister, who argued that French forces were overstretched already. 'You have to understand Joxe,' says Mr Kouchner in a fit of post-victory compassion. 'He has to manage all the troops being called on by the UN. I push, he brakes, that is normal.' But the upshot is that France now has more troops - over 10,000 - than any other country in the UN (mainly in Bosnia, Cambodia and Somalia). For Mr Kouchner, this doctrine of 'humanitarian intervention' has made fantastic progress. 'We (French doctors) used to be considered boy scouts - now states intervene under the UN flag.' A final Kouchner victory came last week with the announcement that future conscripts could do a 16-month 'humanitarian service' in the third world, instead of serving their 11 months in the French army. 'I campaigned nine years for this,' says Mr Kouchner, pointing out that he receives 25,000 requests a year from conscripts asking him for a 'do-good' alternative. Mr Kouchner is unique among European ministers responsible for humanitarian aid in that, unlike them, his other charge is not development aid, but the health ministry. This puts him outside the foreign policy establishment - and that is where he wants to stay. He refused Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy's suggestion last autumn that he should take on the development aid ministry as well. 'I felt it better to stay with health', as a doctor among doctors, who 'do not have to take account of frontiers and political realities'. In any case, he points out, '60 to 70 per cent of humanitarian aid is carried out around medicine'. Drab normality may soon reassert itself, if the conservative opposition wins the March election. 'The right have asked me to stay on,' says Mr Kouchner, who claims to be 'of the left' but wears no party label and is not standing for election. He declined. He suspects that a conservative government would put humanitarian aid back under the control of the Quai d'Orsay. Furthermore, 'after five years in office, I want to come back for one or two years to reality and normality'. What does this comprise? 'Hospital work, sun, humanitarian missions, setting up a foundation, thinking, writing, looking at women.' 'I might return to politics in time for the presidential election (in 1995).' To stand in his own right for the Elysee? 'No, I intend to stand beside someone else.' Beside whom, he will not say, except to admit that he is 'very close' to Mr Michel Rocard, the likely Socialist standard-bearer. Certainly, a Socialist candidate in 1995 may need all the lustre that Kouchner can lend.</p>

			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOUSE PANEL REJECTS FASTER REFUNDS FOR UTILITY CUSTOMERS  </P> <P> The House Ways and Means Committee on Wednesday refused to prod the nation's  utility companies into paying customers about $19 billion in refunds over the  next few years.  </P> <P> Consumers are owed an average of more than $200 each, but will have to wait up  to 30 years for refunds from gas, electric and telephone companies.  </P> <P> "This shows how powerful the utilities are in Congress," said Rep. Robert T.  Matsui (D-Sacramento), referring to the bill that would have given state  utility commissions the power to order faster refunds. Matsui co-sponsored the  defeated bill, along with Rep. Byron L. Dorgan (D-N.D.).  </P> <P> The dispute revolves around $19 billion in excess funds that utilities  collected from customers to pay future corporate taxes to the federal  government. When Congress enacted the 1986 tax overhaul, it cut the top  corporate rate from 46% to 34%, providing the utilities with the windfall.  </P> <P> Matsui originally sponsored a provision in the 1986 law giving the utilities up  to 30 years to refund the excess charges. He now says that was a mistake, and  sponsored the bill to allow stepped up payment as a remedy.  </P> <P> "This is a simple matter of the public good versus special interests," Matsui  said. "But I couldn't overcome the lobbying of this very influential industry."  </P> <P> Utility companies mounted a determined offensive to preserve the 30-year  timetable. Telephone, power and gas utilities, through political action  committees, increased their political contributions to House members to a total  of $5 million in 1987 and 1988. About $510,000 went to members of the House  tax-writing committee.  </P> <P> The bill lost on a 22-13 vote, with 12 Democrats and one Republican on the  tax-writing panel supporting it.  </P> <P> Matsui said the defeat in committee probably dooms his effort to eliminate the  special deal for utilities. Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) has offered a similar  proposal, but he carries little weight in tax issues.  </P> <P> Opponents of the measure, led by Reps. Ronnie Flippo (D-Ala.) and Ed Jenkins  (D-Ga.), argued that if utilities are required to pay refunds over the next few  years, they might have to borrow to make up for the lost funds and thus be  forced to boost rates.  </P> <P> California ratepayers, topping those in all other states, have paid $1.9  billion extra to utilities to offset the expected taxes. Pacific Bell led all  utilities with $816 million in excess deferred taxes, with Pacific Gas &amp;  Electric owing $429 million and Southern California Edison owing $368 million,  according to tax analysts.  </P></p>

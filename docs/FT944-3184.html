			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / International Company News: Optus posts ADollars 98m loss Optus Communications, the Australian telecommunications carrier set up in competition to the government-owned Telstra, made an operating loss after tax of ADollars 97.7m (USDollars 75.6m) in the year to end-June, writes Nikki Tait. The figure, contained in a filing with the Australian Securities Commission, compares with a ADollars 69.3m loss in the previous 12 months. However, the company, which now competes with Telstra in the long-distance and cellular phone markets, also saw substantially increased revenues of ADollars 834.7m, compared with ADollars 300m in the previous 12-month period.</p>

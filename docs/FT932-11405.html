			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Survey of Hong Kong (6): A surge of interest from the mainland - China's investment in Hong Kong ONE of the least appreciated aspects of the Hong Kong's and China's economic integration is the extent of mainland Chinese involvement in the colony's economy. Four years away from the transfer of sovereignty, China has built itself a position in Hong Kong's economy that is second to none. Mainland interests have taken to doing business in Hong Kong with an alacrity that still amazes local observers. With the crumbling of central controls on the mainland - the result of the decentralisation of power from Beijing to the provinces - a singular entrepreneurial spirit, and quite a lot of greed, has been unleashed. The totality of China's investments and claims on Hong Kong is something which can only be guessed. A mainland study published in 1991 estimated that China's direct investment in Hong Kong amounted to HKDollars 78bn. A more recent mainland study estimated that China had invested HKDollars 156bn in Hong Kong and Macao during 1992 alone. These figures are impossible to verify, but could well be accurate. But an indication of the scale of known mainland investment in Hong Kong is indicated by mainland investment in the Hong Kong stock market, the property market and the level of deposits which mainland banks have in Hong Kong. For example: Mainland interests exercise known control over 19 listed companies on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The aggregate market value of these companies is about HKDollars 70bn. Mainland figures, some of whom are officers in, or have close links to, the People's Liberation Army and other agencies of the Chinese government, head other nominally Hong Kong companies. China's involvement in the Hong Kong market is set to increase significantly when plans to list nine large state-owned Chinese companies on the exchange come to fruition over the coming 12 months. These nine - which embrace brewing, petrochemicals and shipping, among others - are seen as just the first wave of mainland listings in Hong Kong, prompting some analysts to forecast that by 2,000 China-backed companies could account for half of the total market capitalisation of the Hong Kong market. But the activities of China's quoted companies are still modest compared with the activities of the privately-held 'four heavenly sisters' - Bank of China group, China Merchants, China Resources, and China Travel service. In aggregate, they are responsible for at least 15 per cent of Hong Kong's trade. Mainland Chinese investors have also been big players in Hong Kong's property market. According to Brooke Hillier, a property consultancy, mainland interest are the largest external investors in the colony's property market - with an estimated 3 per cent ownership of Hong Kong's property stock, valued at more than HKDollars 50bn. According to Mr Nicholas Brooke, the firm's senior partner, mainland investors have shown themselves to be astute players of the property market. They were large investors in Hong Kong's residential market in early 1991 and benefited from the 60 per cent rise in prices that year and the 25 to 30 per cent rise in prices in the first half of last year. At that time they switched into office properties, benefiting since from the 30 to 40 per cent rise in capital values for prime office space, as well as spotting the bottom of the rental cycle. Mr Brooke says that mainland investors have also been imaginative in 'buying wholesale and selling retail' - that is, purchasing a building and then selling strata titles over individual floors and offices. China also has a sizeable claim on Hong Kong's banking system. The colony's banking system's net indebtedness to mainland Chinese banks - deposits held by mainland banks minus Hong Kong banks' loans to China - at the end of last year amounted to HKDollars 42.4bn. The rise in the mainland's claims on Hong Kong's banks has risen dramatically since the mid-1980s and is a direct consequence of the progressive loosening of foreign exchange controls in China and the rapid growth in foreign business involvement in the Chinese economy. Monetary officials in Hong Kong also believe that the preference for Hong Kong dollar financial assets reflects a widespread lack of confidence in China with the renminbi (RMB) - China's currency. Over the past 15 months the RMB has devalued by more than 40 per cent against the US and Hong Kong dollars. It would be tempting to view China's growing position in Hong Kong's economy as part of a grand design to take over the colony before 1997. But try as it might, it is unlikely that Beijing can, in any meaningful sense, control the activities of mainland companies any more than it can control what is happening in the south of the country. The Xinhua News Agency in Hong Kong - Beijing's unofficial embassy in the colony - has been conducting a vigorous campaign to unseat Mr Chris Patten, the colony's governor. It has attempted - though Cultural Revolution-style 'struggle sessions' - to make mainland businessmen boycott the Hong Kong government. But as one senior mainland businessman noted: 'We have nothing to do with Xinhua. They want to control us, but they cannot. China has too many companies in Hong Kong.' A more plausible explanation for the presence of mainland companies in Hong Kong is the colony's role as an open financial centre and the colony's status as 'foreign' for business purposes on the mainland. It is an aspect of Deng Xiaoping's 'socialism with Chinese characteristics' that this 'foreign' status applies to Hong Kong registered subsidiaries of mainland companies. All regions on the mainland offer tax holidays and a much reduced tax rate to foreign joint ventures. Regulations governing the management of joint ventures - including that hiring and firing of labour is easier, pay and conditions can be related to market conditions, and there is greater freedom to keep foreign earnings offshore - are also much more lenient than those which state-owned enterprises have to follow. In this sense then, Hong Kong has a crucial role to play in China's industrial modernisation. But it is also a location for mainland interests - the military and senior Communist Party officials - to accumulate private wealth. In May last year a consortium of mainland and Hong Kong interests, led by Hong Kong Macao Holdings, agreed to pay the Jardine-controlled Hongkong Land HKDollars 3.8bn for an office block in the Central district of Hong Kong. Mr Hu Jinguang, Hong Kong Macao's chairman, in spite of his Panamanian passport, is believed to be a colonel in the People's Liberation Army.</p>

			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / International Company News: Wells Fargo hit hard by Dollars 700m loan-loss provision AN EXPECTED Dollars 231m fourth-quarter loss and Dollars 700m of bad debt provisions in the quarter wiped out almost all of the 1991 profits at Wells Fargo, the big California commercial banking group. Heavy real estate loan losses and the deteriorating California economy contributed to the slump, which resulted in Dollars 21m of net profits for 1991, compared with Dollars 712m in 1990. This translates into 1991 net earnings per share of 4 cents, compared with Dollars 13.39 the previous year. Although the bank announced the gloomy outlook before Christmas, investors on Wall Street yesterday reacted to the news by marking down the Wells Fargo share price by Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 65. Wells Fargo initially indicated it would be making heavy real estate bad debt provisions following a tough inspection by US bank regulators in December. Mr Carl Reichardt, chairman of the bank, said yesterday the economic environment 'continues to be difficult for banks'. He said it was, therefore, appropriate that a significant addition to loan-loss reserves be made. Wells said its non-interest expenses rose by 18 per cent, to Dollars 2.02bn, in 1991, caused in large part by costs associated with higher foreclosed assets. At year-end, the bank's non-performing and re-structured loans amounted to Dollars 1.98bn, or 4.5 per cent of total loans. As of last month, the bank's commercial real estate lending amounted to Dollars 12.7bn of total bank lending of Dollars 46bn. Nationbank, the renamed bank resulting from the merger of NCNB of Charlotte, North Carolina, and C&amp;S/Sovran of Atlanta, Georgia, said it suffered a Dollars 243.8m fourth-quarter loss, mainly because of costs associated with the merger. The bank, which now ranks as the fourth largest in the US in terms of assets, said it made a profit of Dollars 201.8m for the whole of 1991.</p>

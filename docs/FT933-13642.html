			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Sport: Cities of gold - Olympics JUAN Antonio Samaranch calls it a Golden Rule. While it might occasionally be necessary to bribe or flatter the International Olympic Committee it is never good tactics to visibly bully them. The US Congress appears bent on such a course, with its opposition to Beijing's candidature for the 2000 Olympics. 'We are a bit surprised at the attitude,' said Samaranch, in London this week and using the royal plural which he favours. 'We remember very well that in the 1984 Games at Los Angeles the Chinese were received as heroes. And now they have Most Favoured Nation status in trade with America. So we do not understand this change. We have to respect all the governments of the world and work with them. But they have to respect us and our independence.' In case such high-minded appeals fail he revealed that lobbyists are working Capitol Hill on behalf of the IOC. Samaranch expects no long-term problems from the US. Furthermore, many lobbyists in Washington work on corporate accounts and many big businesses stand to benefit from the rapid internationalisation of China which the 2000 Games could help stimulate. Many of the IOC's 90 members are not from the west and tend to resent weight-throwing by Uncle Sam. It may also prove counter-productive come the privacy of the vote in Monte Carlo on September 23. Four voters have already indicated that they will support Beijing to show that they cannot be pushed around. With 10 weeks to go, the temperature is rising among the bidding cities. The publication last Monday of the IOC's technical report added fuel. It gave Sydney highest marks, saying that it 'felt the concept of the Games was based on priority to the athletes'. The Australian city has long been a front-runner, so the report was little more than another A+ for a high achiever. Perhaps more interesting was the bucketing it gave the bid from Brasilia. Senior IOC figures have already privately dismissed the Brazilian effort as the worst in Olympic history. Samaranch conceded in London that he had asked them to withdraw, but Brasilia had complied with the regulations and he was powerless. In Monaco, the voting will take several rounds, with the least-supported city dropping out each time until a clear majority is achieved. Stories are emerging of a Latin-American first-round block vote, orchestrated by Fifa president Joao Havelange, to prevent Brasilia's humiliation. If such a scheme mustered, say, just 10 votes on the first ballot, when members often vote to fly the regional flag, it could knock out candidates such as Manchester or Sydney. Samaranch concedes the possibility but shrugs the resigned answer of the diplomat he once was. 'I cannot properly tell my members not to vote for them. And if I did, maybe they don't follow my advice when they write on the ballot slips.' He had just returned from a visit to Manchester, inspecting the extant and planned Olympic facilities. He found the northern city in jubilant mood, following the technical report which had placed it second to Sydney and far ahead of Beijing. Comparing Manchester's present state with his visit four years ago in connection with the bid for the 1996 Games, Samaranch was complimentary. 'Manchester is now a bid with stones, not just words,' he said, referring to the building projects under way or just completed, such as the Olympic terminal at the airport. In spite of Samaranch's policy of verbal and voting neutrality - he does not vote in the choice of city - there are signals that Beijing is his baby. He said that he was pleased that the Olympics are now symbolically and commercially powerful enough to be the engine of change, although he is careful to insist that the IOC is not a deliberate agent of 'political change.' 'The 1964 Games in Tokyo were the turning point for the post-war Japanese economy,' he said. 'Seoul brought big changes in politics and economics. It is now the second most powerful economy in Asia and they have a full democratic government.' Asked if he thought choosing China would be a high-risk strategy for the IOC, Samaranch accepted that it would divide the Olympic family into two camps. 'Some people say that to support Beijing is to support the Chinese government. Others believe that it would support the possibility of huge economic and political changes in China.' In other words, the Olympic movement, as the good fairy, is able to achieve through 'Higher, Faster, Stronger' what the polity of nations assembled elsewhere have been unable to manage. Samaranch will not necessarily get his way. Bidding cities have seldom been able to assemble enough committed friends to guarantee a win. If that had been true they would have won at the first ballot. 'The crucial thing at this stage is not to have enemies,' said a senior, highly experienced Manchester figure. On that basis, the most likely betting order is Sydney and Manchester followed by Beijing. Do not stake the rent money on Istanbul, Berlin or Brasilia.</p>

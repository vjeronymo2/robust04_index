			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> PAC-10 TOURNAMENT: WHY BOTHER?  </P> <P> Arizona's recent resurgence notwithstanding, the Pacific 10 Conference is going  to have difficulty convincing the NCAA Basketball Tournament Selection  Committee its conference ranks with the nation's elite. For awhile, the  Pac-10's balance was its strength this season, but the way the Wildcats have  made a shambles of games down the stretch has altered that notion considerably.  </P> <P> For all practical purposes, the Pac-10 tournament championship game scheduled  for Sunday at ASU is a foregone conclusion. Arizona has won its last nine  Pac-10 games by an average of 21.2 points and should have a home-court  advantage as fans make the 100-mile trip north from Tucson.  </P> <P> There's really nothing to prove this weekend. The Pac-10's prime contenders for  an invitation to the NCAA party can only damage their chances by playing an  anticlimactic tournament. Hats off to the Pac-10 presidents for having the  wisdom to terminate it.  </P> <P> This is not the ACC or the Big East, where fans go into a frenzy over  basketball. Those postseason tournaments gave everyone ideas, but the  atmosphere simply isn't the same in the West. Have you been to a game at USC or  ASU lately? UCLA's fans are like programmed robots. They show up, but they  don't really seem to care. Except for places like Tucson, Berkeley, Corvallis,  Las Vegas and Goleta, there isn't much intensity or emotion for college hoops.  </P> <P> Even Lute Olson, who has done a masterful job bringing back his young Wildcats  from an 0-2 conference start to a co-championship, wants no part of the Pac-10  tourney. In fact, he suggests his team's comeback may not have been necessary  if there was no conference tourney.  </P> <P> "Because of the tourney," Olson explained, "we had to make a tough Pac-10 trip  to Oregon in early December. Now, without a tournament next year, we'll be able  to play our conference games when we should, after the first of the year."  </P> <P> The inference is that the Wildcats might not have suffered back-to-back defeats  at the Oregons, Nov. 30-Dec. 2, if the games had been played four or five weeks  later. But at least the Pac-10 had an opportunity to delude itself about parity  while Dr. Olson required more time to create his monster. Oregon State had a  chance to tie for the title, and Cal likely will land in the NCAA tournament  for the first time in 30 years.  </P> <P> That's a healthy situation, of course, but the public shouldn't be swayed into  thinking the Pac-10 is a powerhouse. All of its top teams have weaknesses,  though Arizona obviously has the blossoming talent to overcome them. The  Wildcats are best equipped to advance in the NCAAs, joining Nevada-Las Vegas  and Loyola Marymount as the best teams on the West Coast.  </P> <P> Keep in mind that Arizona didn't have to beat great teams during its current  11-game winning streak, with the exception of a 78-74 victory over Oklahoma,  now No. 1. The Wildcats blew away Cal by 25 points at Berkeley and crushed  passive Oregon State by 27 Saturday to tie the Beavers for the championship.  </P> <P> While the Wildcats were demolishing their Pac-10 competition, they ventured out  of conference play for three games: losses at Pittsburgh, UNLV and Duke. This  doesn't bode well for the Pac-10 in the tourney, and it's apparent Arizona's  best days are ahead, when redshirt Chris Mills joins the steadily improving  team next season.  </P> <P> Oregon State and Cal are good, not great. UCLA doesn't deserve NCAA tourney  consideration following its collapse. UC Santa Barbara and New Mexico State are  more worthy. The Beavers will go as far as Gary Payton takes them. They  over-achieved in the Pac-10, but are vulnerable to any tournament team with  bulk up front and sharp-shooting guards.  </P> <P> The Golden Bears have made strides in becoming a road-tough team, leading the  Pac-10 with a 7-2 road record in conference play, yet their inconsistency  remains. How else can you explain a mere 5-4 conference record at home,  including blowouts by Arizona, UCLA and Stanford?  </P> <P> Moreover, Cal may not make it to the NCAA tournament if it is eliminated  quickly in the Pac-10 tournament. Ironically, Lou Campanelli was a proponent of  the conference tournament. Pretenders love the format. It's a lot easier to win  20 games when you play 35, as the Bears did in 1986-87. Contenders, like Olson,  would just as soon sit on their reputation.  </P> <P> Why the Big West and the West Coast Conference went to a postseason tourney is  more understandable. They begged for recognition in the shadow of the Pac-10,  so the national TV exposure of conference tourney title games proved beneficial  for their images.  </P> <P> But those conferences won't gain with such games this week. Loyola Marymount  seemed a WCC tourney cinch until tragedy struck Sunday. It is extremely  doubtful the conference will have more than one team in the NCAA event, and the  23-5 Lions have been weakened mentally and physically by the loss of Hank  Gathers.  </P> <P> UNLV also has nothing to gain and everything to lose by having to prove itself  all over in the Big West tourney this weekend. New Mexico State and UCSB proved  the Rebels vincible with regular-season upsets at home, but aren't likely to  down the best team in the West on a neutral court. Early losses by New Mexico  State and Santa Barbara this week, however, could hinder their NCAA chances.  </P> <P> It all depends on the draw, of course, but UNLV seems more capable of advancing  in postseason play than do the inexperienced Wildcats. Since Loyola Marymount  has decided to participate, the Lions' record-shattering offensive pace is  disruptive to teams accustomed to playing conventionally. LMU also is blessed  with talented shooters such as Bo Kimble and Jeff Fryer.  </P> <P> UNLV also has firepower, the best power forward in the West (Larry Johnson) and  perhaps the region's finest defender (Stacey Augmon). The Rebels also have  Jerry Tarkanian, who annually overcomes distractions to finish strong. He  regards the current Rebels potentially his best-balanced team. Who's to argue?  All five starters are averaging in double figures.  </P> <P> The Lions and the Rebels have veteran players on whom you can depend. Arizona  isn't quite to that point yet, but it's a matter of time. Whether that time  will come in the next few days remains to be seen. If not, the Pac-10 will be  on the outside looking in again when the NCAA West Regionals are staged in  Oakland, March 23-25.  </P></p>

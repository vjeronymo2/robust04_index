			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Minister scraps ship register plan The proposal by the Baltic Exchange for an open register of British shipping, aimed at attracting international shipowners to base their operations in London, was shelved by Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, last night. Announcing his decision not to proceed 'for the present', he told the Commons that he was concerned about the impact the new register would have on the existing UK shipping register. Mr MacGregor maintained that it would be better to assess the effectiveness of the new freer regime that had been introduced for the existing register over a reasonable period of time before deciding whether to go further.</p>

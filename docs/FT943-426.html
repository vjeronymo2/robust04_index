			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Observer: Incensed Is England's oldest Roman Catholic school, St Edmund's College, about to exchange its motto - Avita pro Fide (For the Ancient Faith) - for a new catchphrase, 'Fill 'er Up'? The Hertfordshire school, which has been providing a Catholic education since 1568, is seeking planning permission for a petrol station and roadside cafe next to a proposed bypass for the busy A10 London to Cambridge road. Still, the diversification would fit in neatly with St Ed's advice to departing pupils: they should 'have regard to the welfare of others and be of service in the community'.</p>

At a press conference on the same day,  BNF representative Syarhey Navumchik said that signatures in  favor of Z. Paznyak will be collected among Supreme Soviet  deputies and Belarusian citizens. In the words of S. Navumchik,  while one should not count on support from the deputies, the  signature drive among citizens might bring very good results.  According to S. Navumchik, activists from the Free Trade Union  are conducting a survey among workers at several enterprises to  single out the most popular presidential candidates. Initial  results are as follows: of 800 workers at the Minsk Tractor  Plant, only one person each spoke in favor of Stanislav  Shushkevich and Alyaksandr Lukashenka, while the other 798  respondents expressed support for Zyanon Paznyak.</p>

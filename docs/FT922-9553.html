			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (1): Consensus at risk - Investment performance does not currently cause concern, though there are warning signs in Japan. UK funds must decide how to respond to an increase in gilt issues, and any stumble in the equity market might lead to a change in strategy MANAGERS OF Britain's near-Pounds 300bn pension funds are still obsessed with the consensus. The handful of top management companies which have played the game of balanced discretionary management to perfection in the past few years have wound up with an unprecedented proportion of the available business. But is the game about to change? The collapse in the Japanese stock market could be a warning sign. With the typical fund holding 5 per cent of its assets in the Tokyo market at the end of last year, the market's tumble has knocked more than a percentage point off portfolios. It is not a loss which in itself will greatly concern pension fund trustees. They have other, bigger, worries on their minds: the implications of the Maxwell scandal, for instance, which will soon lead to new pensions legislation; and the growing pressure for pension funds to act as good corporate citizens, exercising votes and behaving like responsible proprietors. Investment performance is not currently a source of concern. Most schemes have healthy surpluses. The long run of years of strong equity market performance during the 1980s was resumed last year after a hiccup in 1990. Professional investors mostly remain highly optimistic: last month, according to an opinion survey by Godwins, the pensions consultants, 84 per cent of top fund managers thought that UK equities would be high in a year's time. At the end of 1991, the typical British pension fund, according to the Caps measurement service, had 59 per cent of its assets in UK equities and another 24 per cent in overseas equities. The 83 per cent commitment to equities in aggregate is the highest ever in the UK, and is much greater than for pension funds in other countries: the corresponding figure is some 48 per cent in the US and about 25 per cent (though rising) in the most comparable European country with large and mature pension funds, the Netherlands. At the end of the 1970s, British pension funds were much more diversified than they are now, with some 25 per cent of their assets in sterling bonds (almost entirely UK government securities, or gilts) and a significant direct investment in property, too. The main diversification now is that overseas equities have replaced gilts, which in their fixed-interest form account for only 3 per cent of the average fund today. The justification for this strategic shift is that equities have given splendid performance and are the natural form of investment for final salary-linked pension schemes, which are the most common in Britain. In price terms over the past five years, however, UK equities have performed only in fits and starts. The average annual rate of return of 11.7 per cent achieved in UK equities by pension funds has only just exceeded the gilt return of 11.5 per cent. Overseas equities have lagged badly, returning only 4.4 per cent a year. A few fund managers are starting to look again at the strategy, but there is no inclination on their part to begin with a clean sheet. Most managers regard the performance of the median fund as their benchmark, and indeed this is often part of their contract with the trustees. A modest, but increasing, number of schemes have undertaken asset-liability modelling exercises and have established customised benchmarks. For most external managers, however, to diverge very far from the consensus asset allocation would constitute a severe business risk, more important in practice than the investment risk being borne by the client. Consider the view of Mr Hugh Jenkins, chief executive of Prudential Portfolio Managers, with around Pounds 10bn of corporate pension fund assets under his care. 'We are the people who challenge the consensus,' he claims. But what he means is that the Pru, like other managers, will diverge only slightly from the norm; the intention is to add a percentage point or two of performance without greatly exposing the managers to the risk of serious divergence from the median. For example, the Pru recently had something of a bet on UK equities over the election period, raising its exposure to 63-64 per cent instead of the standard 59 per cent. This has paid off for the Pru, continuing its good run which began last year. But it is far from being a radical formula. One of the few mavericks who rejects the whole approach of trying to be slightly ahead of everyone else year by year (or even quarter by quarter) is Mr Bruce Campbell, an Australian who runs a global management boutique in London called Pyrford International. Much of Pyrford's Pounds 800m-plus under management comes from overseas, but it recently picked up a Pounds 40m mandate from Fisons. At present Pyrford's strategy for UK pension fund clients is to hold only 40 per cent in equities (about half in the UK), with 30 per cent each in bonds and cash. It has nothing in either the Japanese or US stock markets. It was the best performing manager of all in 1990, but was a long way down in the bottom quartile last year, underperforming the Caps median by some 7 per cent. Is this a high-risk approach? 'No, it is the other managers' strategy that carries extremely high risks,' Mr Campbell insists. It is true, however, that conventional managers have been diversifying modestly into international bonds, with the average exposure rising from zero to 6 per cent over the past four years. International bond portfolios, in fact, outperformed UK equity portfolios last year. Specialist international bond managers, however, see little interest so far from UK pension funds. Mr Paul Abberley, fixed income director at Lombard Odier in London, hopes that opportunities will come for his company now that the UK is firmly established in the low inflation EMS currency bloc. 'Fixed income instruments may be more appropriate for UK pension funds than in the past,' he argues. But he admits that there are few global bond briefs from UK pension funds. 'It is slow progress at present.' But UK funds inevitably face a decision about how to respond to the huge prospective increase in gilt issues as the British government moves into the forecast budget deficit - of Pounds 28bn this year. As in the 1970s, it looks as though a substantial proportion of future issues will have to be taken up by domestic pension funds. So far, though, life insurance companies and foreign investors appear to be dominating the gilt-edged auctions. The pension fund strategy consensus survives. So far equities, especially UK equities, have done what has been required of them. The stock market revival after the election on April 9 has put a spring back into the step of fund managers. But successive collapses on Wall Street and in Tokyo - and the fear that the US market may again have departed seriously from fair value - must cast doubt on the wisdom of the current extreme strategy. If the UK equity market falters, the consensus may encounter a real challenge.</p>

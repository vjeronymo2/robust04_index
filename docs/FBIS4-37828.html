			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Arabic, in a  special "With the Events" program, carries from 1438-1614 GMT a  live or recorded phone-in program with Dr. Nabil Sha'th,  "official in charge of the planning and international  cooperation file in the Palestinian authority," who received  phone calls in a "temporary studio" set up at the Palestine  Hotel in Gaza. The phone-in program is interrupted by a news  summary at 1530 GMT. Sha'th answers questions by the program  moderators and callers on various domestic and personal issues,  especially concerning prisoners and deportees. The program is  moderated by Roset Hakim in Jerusalem and Hasan Abu- Zayid Sa'id  and Mu'addi in the studio in Gaza.    Answering a question by a caller from Hebron on rumors about  Hebron being handed to the Palestinian authority early July,  Nabil Sha'th says that according to the Palestinian-Israeli  Declaration of Principles [DOP] signed in Washington, 13 July  was the date set for the start of self-rule in the entire West  Bank. He says that there has been some delay, but he expects  that "if intentions are sincere and if the required effort is  made, all cities of the West Bank will be included within the  framework of the Palestinian authority and self-rule" three  months from now.    Asked by Hasan Abu-Zayid on the date of PLO Chairman Yasir  'Arafat's arrival in the self-rule area, Nabil Sha'th says:  "Abu-Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] always keeps his travel secret and  surprising. Undoubtedly, he will declare the date of his  arrival a few days earlier so that all preparations are made.  However, we should not forget that President 'Arafat is the  president of all Palestinians. Consequently, he has  responsibilities outside Palestine toward the Palestinians  living abroad. He will be also responsible for the situation of  PLO institutions after his return to the homeland. He has to  settle many matters before he returns to Gaza and Jericho.  Also, some preparations must be made in Gaza and Jericho, such  as, among other things, completing the implementation of the  agreement and putting the security measures into practice. I  have always said that I expect 'Arafat to arrive before the end  of this month. This could be the case, but if any delay takes  place, it will not be for much longer."    Asked by a caller from Gaza on employees' salaries and the  economic situation, Sha'th says that "the Palestinian authority  wants to continue to offer the required services to citizens,  including education, health, sewerage system, illuminating  streets, protecting beaches, and other similar matters. All  this, including security, needs taxes to make them possible.  Now we are fully responsible for security. This requires  salaries for the police and others. We will receive  international aid in the first year. This aid will enable us to  offer services before we manage to collect the taxes needed for  that. We will seriously discuss the possibility of increasing  salaries. I asked brother Abu-Shar'iah, who is responsible for  personnel affairs at the civil administration, to draw a plan  for increasing the salaries of government employees so as to  bring them close to the salaries paid to United National Relief  and Works Agency and private sector employees."    Asked by Roset Hakim whether the Palestinian police will  exert efforts to capture the killers of a Hamas [Islamic  Resistance Movement] activist, who was killed in Bayt Lahiya on  22 June, Sha'th says: "Definitely. We will not allow any  killer, assailant, or thief to escape punishment. This is not  because we want to take revenge on anybody, but to give all  citizens a feeling of justice and security irrespective of their  political affiliation and geographic locations."    Asked by Hakim whether he is holding contacts with  representatives of the Palestinian opposition to learn about  their stand on the peace process and the possibility of their  participation in future self-rule elections, Sha'th says: "I  will be holding such contacts very soon. I started by resolving  the problems facing the police and the civil authority through  cooperation with my colleagues and brothers. I am visiting  professional Palestinian communities--workers, merchants, and  others. I know that some of my colleagues are in constant  contact with the opposition. I will gladly hold contacts with  them to achieve a genuine peace, national unity, democracy, and  participation by all. In light of peace and the agreements that  we have signed, we want to give everybody a chance to take part  in building their homeland and future."    A telephone call was also received from Dr. Mahmud  al-Zahhar,  a Hamas leader in Gaza. In a brief dialogue, Sha'th and  al-Zahhar exchange greetings and hope to meet soon. Al-Zahhar  says: "First, we beseech God Almighty to grant you and your  brothers here success. You are all welcome to your homeland. We  beseech God that your presence here will be beneficial for the  homeland and will spare us harm and evil, signs of which are  evident through the agents' escalation of their activity against  honorable persons of various affiliations. This has resulted in  the martyrdom of youth Nasir Salluha. This is extremely  regrettable. We hope that the police will not take its role  fully to establish justice and to put an end to those agents."    Sha'th responds: "I wholeheartedly support you, brother  Mahmud. We will not relinquish our responsibility. Defending  you and all those affiliated to your organization and all the  children of those people who struggled and paid sacrifices to  achieve genuine security, effective participation, and justice  is a responsibility which we are assuming without hesitation."    Asked to comment on some Palestinian prisoners' intention to  receive 'Arafat upon his arrival in the self-rule area with  black flags, Sha'th says that Palestinian prisoners have  suffered a great deal from prisons and that peace has not  secured their release although they had a role in the start of  the peace process. He says that Palestinian officials are  sparing no effort to secure their release. He says that the  Cairo agreement has created the mechanism for the release of all  prisoners, noting that special arrangements and negotiations are  still needed.    Asked by Hasan Abu-Zayid on Jerusalem and recent statements  by Faruq Qaddumi, head of the PLO Political Department, on a  Palestinian-Israeli "secret file concerning Jerusalem," and  whether a "new media clamor" about Jerusalem is imminent, Nabil  Sha'th says: "I do not believe that what is required is a media  clamor. What is required are clear bases for action regarding  the issue of Jerusalem. I believe that brother Abu-al-Lutf  [Faruq Qaddumi] also refers to Holst's message, which  constitutes a part of the overall Oslo accords. I remind the  brother listeners that among the Oslo accords were the DOP which  was signed in Washington, the letters exchanged between  President 'Aaraft and Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin on mutual  recognition between the PLO and Israel, and this message by  Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres to Holst, the late Norwegian  foreign minister. What is required is for everyone of us to  realize what these bases are. First, the final status of  Jerusalem will be decided by the agreement that will result from  the negotiations on the final status. These negotiations will  begin within a period not exceeding two years after the signing  of the DOP. The agreement will be implemented within a period  not exceeding five years, which is the transitional period --  three years after the first two years. However, the  implementation of the DOP on the final status of Jerusalem is  based on the implementation of Resolutions 242 and 338. In  other words, Jerusalem is considered an occupied city. It is  not an annexed city, but a city like other cities in the West  bank and Gaza occupied in 1967. Until we arrive at the final  status, every side has its declared objectives. Our declared  objective is that in the final status, we want East Jerusalem to  be the capital of an independent Palestinian state. As for the  relationship between east and west Jerusalem, this is a topic of  negotiation. We do not want a new Berlin wall between east and  west Jerusalem. This is something that will be decided in the  negotiations. Until we arrive at this situation, our rights in  east Jerusalem must be maintained. We must not be prevented  from entering Jerusalem and the Palestinian civilian and  religious institutions in the city must be defended. The  Israeli Government must not take any measures preventing  citizens' freedom and rights in Jerusalem. This is our  position, and this is what has been achieved by Holst's message.  What is required is abidance by this agreement rather to be  engaged in media rows about it."    Asked by Abu-Zayid on the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations  that will start on 27 June, Sha'th says that the first topic on  the agenda will be drawing timetables for the release of  remainder of Palestinian prisoners. He says that the  negotiations will deal with issues not included in the  Gaza-Jericho agreement and deployment of Palestinian authority  and police throughout the West Bank in preparation for Israeli  withdrawal from cities and villages and in preparation for the  elections which will be held when withdrawal is completed. He  says that those negotiations will "most probably" be held in  Gaza and Israel.</p>

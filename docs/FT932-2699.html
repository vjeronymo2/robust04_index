			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / International Company News: Bank of Montreal plans to expand presence in US BANK of Montreal, Canada's third biggest bank, plans to broaden its presence in the US by launching an expansion and acquisition drive through its Chicago-based subsidiary, Harris Bankcorp. BoM yesterday named Mr Alan McNally, vice-chairman for personal and commercial banking, as Harris's new chief executive. He replaces Mr Kenneth West, who has been chief executive since BoM bought Harris nine years ago. Mr McNally will have a mandate to triple Harris's branch network and assets, currently almost USDollars 13bn, within the next 10 years. Harris will focus efforts on Illinois, as well as other surrounding states, including Michigan and Ohio. Ms Linda Stromberg, an analyst at Howe Barnes in Chicago, described Harris as a 'sleepy, conservative' institution, which has so far failed to capitalise on the gradual easing of Illinois' curbs on branch banking. These curbs have left the state with a highly fragmented banking industry, with about 1,200 separate institutions. Ms Stromberg predicts a rash of mergers and consolidations over the next few months. Some powerful regional banks based in nearby states have also signalled an interest in the Illinois market. Harris is the third biggest downtown Chicago bank, after First Chicago and Continental Illinois. One of its smaller rivals, LaSalle, was bought by ABN-Amro of the Netherlands in 1989. Since then, LaSalle has acquired a number of savings and loan institutions which it has turned into bank branches. Bank of Montreal, with assets of CDollars 109bn (USDollars 85.8bn), set a target in 1990 of boosting the contribution of US business to 50 per cent of earnings. But the US component has so far remained little changed at around 25-26 per cent. BoM also announced a reorganisation yesterday which would bring its US and Canadian corporate and investment banking business under a single North American umbrella. The bank will in future be divided into four divisions. Besides North American corporate and investment banking, the new units will comprise BoM's core retail and small-business operations in Canada, and similar operations of Harris in the US.</p>

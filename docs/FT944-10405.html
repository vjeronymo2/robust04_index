			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow gyrates wildly as investors reassess poll Wall Street US share prices fluctuated wildly yesterday as markets struggled to gauge the impact of broad Republican victories in Tuesday's congressional elections, writes Lisa Bransten in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up a net 1.01 at 3,831.75. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost just 0.25 at 465.40, while the American Stock Exchange composite ended 0.2 firmer at 451.25 and the Nasdaq composite 0.29 easier at 767.25. Trading volume on the New York SE totalled 338m shares. In early trading the Dow surged 38 points on optimism about Republican control of Congress, but later in the morning the gain was wiped out as concern about conflict between a Democratic president and Republican legislature took hold. Program trading and investor profit-taking took the Dow down a net 20 points at one stage, but prices recovered later in the day. In addition to uncertainty about the government, investors were waiting to see the extent of interest rate increases expected to come out of next Tuesday's meeting of the Federal Reserve's open market committee meeting. Healthcare stocks got a boost from the election news as traders reacted optimistically to the probable death of broad health reforms proposed by the Democratic President, Mr Bill Clinton. Shares of drugmakers were up broadly at the close in spite of some midday volatility: Merck, a component of the Dow, gained Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 36 7/8 , Pfizer was up Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 76 1/8 , Bristol-Myers Squibb added Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 58 7/8 and Eli Lilly put on Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 64 3/8 . Defence contractors also got an initial boost from the markets as traders ventured that Republican gains might stem decreases in defence spending. After strong early rises, General Electric fell to end Dollars  3/8 off on the day at Dollars 48 3/4 and Raytheon was up a net Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 63 7/8 . Northrop Grumman gained Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 44 1/2 and Lockheed rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 73 1/2 . Hospital companies Columbia/HCA Healthcare and National Medical Enterprises also advanced and retreated with the markets. Columbia was up Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 41 1/4 and NME gained Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 14 1/2 . Shares of Long Island Lighting, a New York City-area provider of gas and electrical services, fell Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 16 1/2 on the defeat of the incumbent state governor Mr Mario Cuomo, who had proposed state acquisition of the utility. In trading unrelated to the elections, the railroad Santa Fe Pacific rose sharply by Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 16 1/8 after Union Pacific sweetened its offer to Santa Fe shareholders. Union Pacific shares dropped Dollars 2 to Dollars 47 1/2 . If the takeover is overturned by regulators, it could be stuck with Santa Fe shares worth far less than the proposed purchase price. SciMed Life Systems moved up Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 51 1/4 on news that the medical device company would be bought by Boston Scientific for Dollars 865m in stock.</p>

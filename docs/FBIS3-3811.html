			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 22 (XINHUA) -- Jiang Zemin, general  secretary of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist  Party and Chinese president, called for attaching importance to  family planning work so as to contribute to China's economic and  social development.    At a national family planning forum sponsored by the State  Council, Jiang urged local governments to make efforts to  realize plans to control population growth and to raise family  planning work to a new height.    Premier Li Peng and other Chinese leaders Qiao Shi, Li  Ruihuan, Zhu Rongji, Liu Huaqing and Hu Jintao attended the  forum.    After analyzing China's population situation, Jiang said  that  while the achievements in family planning work have been  confirmed, the task of China's family planning work remains  arduous.    He pointed out that China's family planning policy is based  on the Marxist theory that population growth must fit in with  the production of materials and therefore is a correct policy  decision in line with China's basic conditions.    He said that now there is a viewpoint that under the market  economic structure, population control should also be regulated  by the market.    He noted that the viewpoint is incorrect. The family  planning policy is decided by China's basic conditions and the  demands of socialist modernization.    He said that the problem of a huge population coupled with  underdeveloped production will result in a series of problems in  food supply and education.    He said that even though China's population has ceased to  grow, the huge size of the present population will continue to  last for a period.    He said that if China does not carry out the family planning  policy, the uncontrolled growth of the population will produce  an adverse effect on economic development and the interests of  both the state and individuals.    He stressed that under the circumstances of establishing a  socialist market economic structure, population control is a  function of the government and the attempt to regulate  population growth through the market cannot realize China's plan  for population growth.    He called for mobilizing the people in family planning work.  It is every citizen's obligation and contribution to the state  and society to abide by the family planning policy.    He urged officials and party members to take the lead in  carrying out the family planning policy.    Jiang said that this year the CPC Central Committee will  take  measures to enhance the construction of the party organization  in rural areas. The family planning work will be one of the  elements in appraising the party's work in rural areas.    Jiang also talked about study of the population policy and  measures for promoting family planning work.    Premier Li Peng said that the key to family planning work is  in rural areas and he stressed conducting family planning work  among the floating population.</p>

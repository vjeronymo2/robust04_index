			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / International Company News: Euro Disney banks may seek theme park shake-up The Euro Disney banks may demand changes in the management and operation of the EuroDisneyland theme park as part of the emergency financial restructuring package for the troubled leisure group. The banks are awaiting a review of Euro Disney that they commissioned last month from the Paris office of KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy and consulting group. Euro Disney, which lost FFr5.3bn (Dollars 898m) in the year to September 30, is threatened by bankruptcy unless the banks agree to a rescue package. KPMG has been asked to audit Euro Disney's financial position and its capital requirements. The preliminary version of this report, which will form the basis of the banks' strategy in the restructuring talks with Euro Disney and Walt Disney, its US parent company, is scheduled for completion by the end of this week. The banks have charged KPMG with analysing Euro Disney's business plan so that the banks can decide whether changes will be required in the running of the park and in its cost base. This report, which is expected to take longer to finish than the financial audit, will be used to assess whether the banks should ask for strategic or personnel changes to be made at Euro Disney. 'There is deep dissatisfaction among the banks as to the way that Disney has managed Euro Disney,' said a banker involved with the negotiations. 'It is possible that we may press for changes. We also have to be sure that the cost base comes down. But nothing will be decided until KPMG has completed its work.' Walt Disney would be expected to resist any attempt by the banks to influence the running of Euro Disney. It prides itself on its strong corporate culture and was, until the Euro Disney debacle, regarded as one of the most most successful companies in the US. However the banks, which have been asked by Disney to exchange part of their FFr20.3bn loans for equity as part of the restructuring package, are anxious to protect their position. Disney has implemented changes at Euro Disney since the park's opening in April 1992. Many of the original US executives have been replaced by Europeans. Mr Philippe Bourguignon, chairman, has overhauled Euro Disney's policies for marketing, merchandising and pricing.</p>

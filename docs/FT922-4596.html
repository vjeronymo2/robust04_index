			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Arts: A maze of a movie - Cinema THE PLAYBOYS (12) Odeon Haymarket THE LAWNMOWER MAN (15) Odeon Leicester Sq RUSH (18) Empire THE FIVE HEARTBEATS (15) Prince Charles The Playboys resembles one of those pocket games where you steer a small silver ball, or several, into the heart of a maze. The silver balls here are stars Albert Finney, Aidan Quinn and Robin Wright, playing a pretty, unwed mother and her two suitors in 1950s rural Ireland, and the maze is the film's plot. Co-written by Kerry Crabbe and Shane (My Left Foot) Connaughton, this contains enough blind alleys and colourful digressions to render the unwary intruder stark staring mad. It would also seem to require a director with more sense of direction than Gillies Mackinnon. The Scottish-born film school graduate is known for works like Conquest of the South Pole and Needle where narrative cogency is a willing casualty of stylistic or structural experiment. Here we have a story. And the story includes unmarried motherhood, haymaking, suicide by shotgun (Adrian Dunbar as an early adorer of Miss Wright), a band of strolling players (the eponymous Playboys led by Milo O'Shea), a policeman gnawed by amorous jealousy (Mr Finney), a lovable troubadour (Mr Quinn, attached to the said Playboys), smugglers, the IRA, the arrival of television, and Gone With The Wind showing at the local cinema. How do you steer your silver balls into that labyrinth? In the event, the film proves perversely enjoyable: being lost in a maze often is. The happiest conceit was to use the theatre troupe's quick-change repertory of plays - Othello one night, something occult the next, Gone With The Wind with songs a third - as a comical distorting mirror to the village intrigues. Finney's police sergeant, part volcano, part buffoon, is Othello with a side order of Les Dawson; while Quinn's roguish charm becomes Rhett Butler with a County Cavan accent. The longer the film lasts, the more accustomed we become to its multi-diversionary style. And the more we sense a harmony in the motifs, which all hint at an old world changing to a new: from the birth of television to the sexual politics of single motherhood. Most unifying force of all is Miss Wright as the swept-several-ways heroine. International pre-sales probably demanded that an American actress play an Irish heroine. But this actress (late of The Princess Bride and State Of Grace) does so with flawless accent and also suggests Hardyesque depths and strengths to a girl lost in a maelstrom of love, not to mention a maze of a movie. The Lawnmower Man has been hailed as the first Virtual Reality film. VR is the state-of-art system whereby, donning a computerised helmet and glove and sitting in a movement-simulator seat, we can see, hear and even feel imaginary worlds. Why, given this Promethean gadgetry, we should want to see, hear or feel any of the things featured in this sci-fi thriller directed by Brett Leonard is another matter. The film is not 'in' Virtual Reality of course - can you imagine an Odeon Leicester Square full of helmets, gloves and twitching seats? - but about it. Dr Pierce Brosnan, a scientist at Cybertech, performs VR experiments on a retarded gardener (Jeff Fahey) which go horribly wrong. Though transformed from simpleton to superman in about two weeks, Mr Fahey is soon 'mowing' people's brains with his telekinetic powers. And when he makes electronic love to a girl via Virtual Reality, the results are disastrous. Using computer images about as inspired as Disney's ten-year-old Tron, the film is an essay in Virtual Fatuity sometimes raised to Achieved Banality. The 'real' characters are even less lifelike than their electronic projections. And the progressively inchoate script, based on a Stephen King story crossed with a project of the director's own called CyberGod, was probably written in a screenwriting-simulation seat. In this the writer is swayed about by a whole lot of seeming inspirations only to discover on waking that all that remains in his head is colourful gibberish. Rush is one of those Hollywood thrillers whose plot the critic can intuit in advance by scanning the list of minor characters in his cast list: 'Yellow Rose Waitress', 'Wino', 'Scooter Trash', 'Man In Hearse', 'Medical Examiner.' Ah: must be about petty violence and alcoholic abuse in Texas escalating into death or murder. Amazing, Holmes. Yes, Watson, but years of schooling in the Virtual Insanity that is cinema teach one, first, that Hollywood does everything by numbers and, secondly, that it cannot add up. So this tale of two narcotics policepersons (Jason Patric and Jennifer Jason Leigh) who risk addiction by using drugs themselves - to impress the dealers they wish to entrap - moves powerfully through early and middle scenes only to collapse near the end. The climax has our hero and heroine 'hiding' from the villains, after blowing the whistle on them, by spending the night in a lonely, exposed caravan park about a mile from the nearest telephone. Dear me. Are you surprised when Miss Leigh wakes up to find the Chief Baddie's shotgun in her mouth? Cue screams, blood pellets and homilies over the receding stretcher. Before this, erstwhile producer Lili Fini Zanuck (Driving Miss Daisy) makes a fair fist of her directing debut. She pummels tension into some over-wordy scenes  -screenplay by Pete Dexter from the bestselling book by narcotics cop and ex-addict Kim Wozencraft - and she coaxes a beautiful performance from Miss Leigh. This pudgy-pretty actress, recently memorable as the live-in lover of a psychopath (Miami Vice), deftly suggests the quiet birthpangs of panic. Watch her face in one scene as masquerade changes to reality and she watches her partner forced to inject real heroin. Robert Townsend's The Five Heartbeats is an early harbinger of the summer silly season. Subject: the rise and disintegration of a black rock group. Time: 1960s. Intellectual level: the same as that of last week's The Mambo Kings. But where that had style and Armand Assante, this has schmaltz and five black actors going OTT. The perky wit that marked Townsend's first feature Hollywood Shuffle is replaced by a game of Guess The Next Cliche. Will it be the lead vocalist who falls horribly apart on drugs? Or the nice manager who is knifed in the back by the nasty one? Or the final reunion in which the band forgets its differences and sings its heart out, oblivious to the scuffle in the cinema auditorium as spectators compete to be first through the exit door.</p>

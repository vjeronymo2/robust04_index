			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / International Company News: Nachi hits Y16bn loss as finance failures bite NACHI-FUJIKOSHI, a leading maker of bearings and machine tools, yesterday revealed the scars inflicted by diversification into financial business during the late 1980s by announcing a net loss of Y16.4bn (Dollars 132.3m) for the year to November and suspending dividends for the first time since 1968. The company, which reported a net profit of Y307m in the previous period, was also hit by the downturn in capital spending by Japanese manufacturing industry, leading to a 20.9 per cent fall in sales to Y132.4bn. Nachi was one of Japan's best-known exponents of zaiteku, or financial speculation, during the late 1980s when many conservative industrial companies invested heavily in the stock market. The stock market collapse over the past three years has created large stock appraisal losses and large unreported property losses, undermining core businesses of several leading companies. Nachi-Fujikoshi reported a stock appraisal loss of Y7.96bn for the year. Along with many other Japanese companies, Nachi established a financial subsidiary during the 1980s, and the parent company was forced to write-off Y5.5bn in loans and guarantees. 'We foresee difficulties ahead, but the company is intending to lift its business performance,' said Nachi, which has begun a three-year streamlining programme aimed at reducing its workforce of 4,800 by about 500 people. The combination of the collapse in asset prices and weak industrial demand has severely weakened the company. For the current year, Nachi expects a pre-tax loss of Y1.8bn (Y4.8bn loss), and sales of Y123bn, down 6.8 per cent.</p>

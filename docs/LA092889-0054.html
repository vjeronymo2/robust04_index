			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR COLLECTIBLES: DON'T PAPER OVER DAMAGED CONDITION OF PRINTED ITEMS  </P> <P> Question: You keep emphasizing that condition is important in making a  collectible purchase. Could you be more specific in terms of collecting paper  items, as opposed to, say, glassware? -- S.G.  </P> <P> Answer: Condition is crucially important in determining the price of almost any  collectible item. This has become increasingly apparent at auctions and  collectors shows as individuals become more and more selective -- and  competitive -- in what they buy.  </P> <P> In the area of paper collectibles, for example, even a slight tear, burn or  glue mark on a newspaper or print can immediately detract from the item's  value. At that point, the collector should balance rarity against condition.  </P> <P> If the item is extremely rare, the collector must decide whether to further  invest in the collectible in an effort to restore it to a level of significant  value.  </P> <P> In the area of glassware, major problems involve chipping and cracks, which  also will detract from value. Again, skilled restorers can be hired if the  restoration price is within your budget.  </P> <P> Obviously, there is a difference between damage and normal wear.  </P> <P> Political buttons, for example, can show handling wear, but this won't  necessarily detract from their value. What's more, attempting to erase wear  marks on any collectible in an effort to make it take on a "new" appearance can  end up damaging the collectible's value.  </P> <P> A general rule of thumb, according to veteran dealers and collectors, is to  attempt to keep a collectible item in as original condition as possible -- and  to consider carefully any decision to restore.  </P> <P> Moreover, they say, pay attention to auction and dealer condition "scales."  Usually, this ranges from "mint" and "excellent" to "good," "average," "fair"  and "poor."  </P></p>

			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Korean companies press for foreign funds - Growing demands for easier access to international capital markets KOREAN companies are no strangers to international capital markets. Since the mid-1980s, Korea's largest corporate names have launched a growing number of issues of convertible bonds, bonds with warrants and, more recently, yankee bonds. In doing so, they have taken advantage of the cheaper borrowing costs and longer maturity of funds available in international capital markets. But, as Korea's Ministry of Finance proceeds cautiously with financial liberalisation, Korean companies are pressing for further freedom to tap international markets. Many want controls on overseas borrowing to be lifted to reduce their funding costs and improve the international competitiveness of their products at a time when Korea needs to boost export growth. Under current regulations, Korean companies may only tap international capital markets if the proceeds are used for investment in overseas operations or for financing imports of advanced foreign technology. In other words, they cannot borrow cheaply abroad and repatriate the funds to finance domestic operations. Mr Chang-Lok Kim, director of international finance at the Finance Ministry, says: 'Our chief concern is that the money (raised abroad) would be transferred back to Korea and would increase the money supply.' The government wants to keep money supply growth - measured by M2 - at about 18.5 per cent. But the ministry is aware of companies' funding concerns. Mr Kim adds: 'Our ultimate goal is to allow Korean companies to borrow abroad to support their domestic operations because we would like to see the free movement of capital. 'The problem is: how do we reconcile allowing the money to support their domestic operations without it having an impact on the domestic money supply?' Until the Finance Ministry allows the free movement of capital, companies must apply for permission to raise funds abroad and then queue up to wait their turn. One investment banker in Seoul says: 'The demand for funds greatly exceeds the amount permitted by the ministry.' It is not difficult to see why demand should be so great. Domestic sources of financing are difficult to obtain or relatively expensive. Prices on the South Korean stock market have been falling steadily over about the last three years. The Korea Stock Price Index (KOSPI) has tumbled from a high of 1,007.77 on April 1 1989 to a low of 459.07 on August 21 this year, although it has since climbed back up to close at 582.74 yesterday. Investors, disenchanted with the performance of their equity holdings, are therefore less willing to stump up cash for new share issues. Bank loans are available, but not always easy to obtain, as banks must meet government credit allocation guidelines. In the domestic bond market, yields on corporate issues are around 15 to 16 per cent, which is high by international standards. Added to this, most corporate bond issues have a maximum maturity of only three years. Korean companies - many heavily indebted already, with gearing ratios of about 350 per cent on average - complain of the shortage of funds and high cost of borrowing. Samsung Electronics, Korea's largest electronics company is one case. If it borrows on the domestic bond market, the cost of funds is likely to approach 17 per cent, once domestic interest rates and underwriting and bank guarantee fees are included. But if it borrows in international capital markets, it estimates the cost of funding would be 8.5 to 9.0 per cent, taking into account the yield on its paper and the forecast depreciation of the won. Samsung spends about Dollars 900m a year on research and development, of which Samsung Electronics accounts for the lion's share - an estimated Dollars 650m. Mr Young-Key Hwang, executive director and group treasurer at Samsung, says: 'The availability of funds is one of our main problems, as well as the cost of funds.' Mr Hwang argues that Korean companies that produce high-technology goods - such as Samsung Electronics - are not competing so much with the domestic companies as with the international names, such as Sony and Hitachi. 'We are the largest R &amp; D spender in Korea - we realise it is the only way we can survive the 1990s,' he says. Other research-intensive companies, such as Hyundai Motor, would also like to see greater freedom to raise funds in the international markets. 'We would like to be able to use the proceeds from international financings for our (domestic) expansion programme, and we do not think that would hurt the economy,' says Mr Bang-Joo Lee, managing director of Hyundai Motor Company. He adds this would allow Hyundai to compete more effectively with foreign manufacturers. Both Hyundai Motor and Samsung Electronics plan to raise money in the international markets shortly. Hyundai hopes to raise Dollars 150m in global depository receipts next month, using the money to buy high-tech equipment from Japan for the development of its third generation of Excel cars. Meanwhile, Samsung Electronics is preparing to sell Dollars 200m of 10-year bonds in the US and to use the proceeds to import semi-conductor manufacturing equipment from the US, Japan and Germany. The issue is expected to be a 144A placement, which has fewer disclosure and SEC regulatory requirements than does a straight public bond issue. The company hopes to be able to raise funds at rates close to those in the public bond market. Samsung Electronics will be the first Korean company to launch such a bond issue since the Finance Ministry opened the door to this form of borrowing in September. Investment bankers in Seoul hope that other Korean companies will follow suit and use the 144A placement route in future, especially if existing limits on overseas financing are eventually lifted.</p>

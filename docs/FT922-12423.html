			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Minding Your Own Business: The shape of thinks to come - Computing THE biggest problem of adding to productivity with a PC is being able to get the information into the computer in the first place. If your work is to do with words, like mine - whether it is a month-end report or the first draft of a instruction manual - then you probably imagine that a word processor would be the best solution. I find it is not. The trouble with word-processors - as with writing by hand - is that they tempt me into putting my ideas into sentences from the outset. I inevitably go back to correct an expression to make it more understandable. The problem with this approach is that I tend to lose the thread of what I want to write about. My answer to this dilemma is to use an outliner, or, as it used to be called, an idea processor. This allows me to type in ideas as they come to me, without arranging them into sentences, or putting them into any particular order. A classic program which allows you to work in this way is PC Outline, though there are others. An outliner should be able to store notes at different levels of importance. It should be possible to collapse it to hide all text below a chosen level, so that the overall structure of the report becomes clear. I usually start with the same four headings: Title; Introduction; Middle-Bit; Conclusion. Then I give the piece a working title. The introduction to a report often consists of why and for whom I am writing - so I merely add the words 'who' and 'why.' The middle bit is the hardest. To start with, I merely write a series of questions which have to be answered. Such an outline generally takes about 10 minutes - 10 minutes well spent. The actual writing is a gradual process: adding more questions; finding and typing the answers. Then there is the ordering of the ideas. The beauty of this approach, particularly when taking notes from reference material, is that it enables you to break down the information very quickly, and when you come to use your references there is no plagiarism involved. If you have notes from several sources, they often lead you in the same direction, but usually from different starting-points. Once you have the information in the outline, you can re-order it to suit your purpose. For instance, in this article I started with the idea of increasing productivity. Beginning from a more computer-based starting-point, the same information can be used for a longer and more detailed review of the particular software packages. As well as outliners, there are other forms of software which allow you to get your basic ideas into the computer quickly, but work on slightly different principles or with added features. The most innovative is CK Modeller, often described as a graphical thinking sketchpad. Instead of using the hierarchical structure of the outliner, it uses text within hexagons, so that more links can be made between ideas. It also allows for different colours to be attributed to each hexagon, to classify the type of information. You might assign yellow hexagons to represent positive items, black for problems, and red for short texts on danger. You can assign only a few words to each hexagon, and these can be rearranged within the honeycomb structure. Each hexagon can have a note attached to it, and there can be gateways to other honeycombs, so that the overall subject can be broken down into building blocks. Though I can see in this great strengths in solving problems, I do not feel that CK Modeller can offer advantages over the outliner for putting together reports and written work. By their nature, these are based on a linear model. PC Outline itself is now bundled with Wordstar; PC Tools has its own outliner within the Desktop suite of programs; Microsoft Word and Word for Windows have their own. The one with Word Perfect is very basic. Lotus Agenda is different again. In fact, when it was first marketed, many people described it as a solution looking for a problem. Agenda gives both a hierarchical view and a category view. A package called Grandview sits squarely between PC Outline and Lotus Agenda. Although it has a built-in word-processor it is more useful for creating, organising, and categorising textual information. Though many sneer at using aids to writing (and outliners in particular), I find it works for me.</p>

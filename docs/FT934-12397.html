			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Unit trusts exceed record despite dip NET SALES of unit trusts were Pounds 668.6m in September, down from Pounds 981.2m in August. But the figure still took net sales for the year to date to Pounds 6.91bn, more than in the whole of 1987, the previous record for a calendar year. The popularity of personal equity plans, which offer tax-free returns, has been a significant factor behind sales of unit trust. Of net unit trust sales of Pounds 2.6bn in the third quarter, Pounds 612m was in Pep form. Funds invested in unit trust Peps now amount to Pounds 6.5bn out of a unit trust total of Pounds 84.1bn. Gross sales of unit trusts in September were Pounds 1.38bn and repurchases Pounds 711.6m. The slight dip in sales from August's total may have been resulted from the weaker performance of stock markets in September, although the markets have rebounded to new highs this month. Compared with August, sales to both private and institutional investors were slightly down. The Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds, which produced the figures, said the most popular funds in September were UK Balanced funds, which invest in a mixture of bonds and equities and can offer a higher income. The least popular were Japan funds.</p>

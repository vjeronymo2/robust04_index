			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> Rohr Industries: The supplier of jet engine nacelles reported a third-quarter  loss of $11.4 million, contrasted with a profit of $7.8 million a year ago.  Sales rose 4% to $234.5 million. The Chula Vista firm attributed the loss to  four factors, the first two of which it said were non-recurring: additional  costs due to redefined acceptance criteria on government contracts, commercial  contract cost performance, program mix changes and increased interest expense.  </P></p>

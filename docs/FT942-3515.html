			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / International Company News: Long march to openness for Citic  -Chinese group gives only sketchy details of profits The China International Trust and Investment Corporation (Citic) this month reported a massive increase in profits, in percentage terms, for 1993, to Yn3.35bn (UDollars 390m), but its annual report provided only sketchy details of how it achieved this seemingly impressive performance leap. While Citic, which is involved in an extensive range of businesses from real estate to manufacturing, is becoming more international, and more open in divulging information about its activities, it still has some way to go to match world standards. Not only is Citic, which is owned 100 per cent by the Chinese government, the parent of increasingly active businesses abroad, including the Hong Kong-listed Citic Pacific; it is also a substantial borrower internationally, having raised Dollars 2bn in 18 bond issues by the end of 1993. This included Dollars 250m in 10-year bonds issued last year in the US market - China's first foray into the US capital markets since 1949. Citic paper has received a generally good reception in international markets because bankers assume the conglomerate, which is one of the standard-bearers of China's socialist-market reforms, carries the full backing of the Chinese government. In Beijing, a European bank spokesman said Citic had 'developed a very good image,' and was now engaged in 'an incredible range of activities.' But when it came to assessing the quality of its assets it was difficult to make judgments. 'When examining the balance sheet you don't really know what you have in front of you,' he said. Citic lists total assets of Yn82.86bn, but provides little detail. The company is heavily involved in real estate, for example, but beyond a sketchy reference in its annual report to the 'strong momentum' of Citic's real estate business, information is sparse. Bankers cite as an example of the difficulties assessing details of Citic's activities the case several years ago of losses incurred in the Bank of Credit and Commerce International fiasco. Citic may have lost as much as Dollars 100m - Citic officials say it was much less - but no reference ever appeared to that episode in its balance sheet. Similarly, only glancing mention is made in Citic's annual report of a manufacturing venture in Shaanxi province with some 20,000 employees which is proving difficult to rehabilitate and is therefore a drain on resources. Citic's charter requires it to play a role in transforming state-owned enterprises. The Shaanxi project, involving conversion of a defence factory to civilian use, was undertaken for political rather than commercial reasons, as Citic officials ruefully admit. In the past year, when reported profits were 882 per cent higher, Citic has also taken over Luoyang Mining Machinery Plant, which has 20,000 employees, with the aim of revitalising another flagging state-owned enterprise. Citic officials say that the Luoyang enterprise, re-named the Citic Heavy Machinery Company, will be, for the time being, the last of such burdens assumed from the state. But this does not mean that Citic - including both its mainland activities, which account for about two-thirds of the conglomerate's business, and its growing investments abroad - is about to enter a consolidation phase. As Mr Wei Mingyi, Citic's chairman, told the Financial Times last year: 'If a company constrains itself by consolidating at a certain level, then I think that company wouldn't have a future. Business is always aggressive: maybe sometimes you win, sometimes you fail.' Citic Pacifc, the Hong Kong listed arm of Citic Hong Kong (Holdings), is an example of this aggressive strategy, with a fast-growing portfolio of investments in telecommunications, aviation, property and finance in Hong Kong. The company is also becoming active on the mainland with recent acquisitions in the Wuxi area, west of Shanghai. These have included a steel plant, a telecommunications cable factory and a precision metal piping plant - investments totalling about Dollars 100m. Citic Australia is similarly engaged in rapid expansion. Building on its 1986 investment in an aluminium smelter west of Melbourne, it recently acquired a meat processing company in Australia; purchased 10 per cent of Yaohan International, a Japanese retailer; established a trading company in Singapore; and late last year listed an investment company, CH China Investment, in Australia. At home, Citic's main priority, according Mr Yao Jinrong, a vice-president, is the development of Daxie Island off the coast of Zhejiang province, south of Shanghai. Citic plans to spend Yn4bn with additional investment of Yn40bn in developing a deep-water port and economic development zone. One of Daxie's main functions would be to provide an outlet for China's land-locked south-western provinces, including Guizhou and Yunnan. Citic is also involved in a consultancy business, power development, telecommunications (including the manufacture of pagers), cable television, finance and trading. All this is placing substantial demands on its management capabilities. Vice-president Mr Yao is not exaggerating when he describes Citic as a 'very important financial institution'. With its high level connections  - its founder, Mr Rong Yiren, is now China's vice-president - the company is keenly sought as a mainland partner by foreign investors. 'They are still a name-card which opens a lot of doors in China,' said a western businessman. As Citic's business expands, however, and its demand for capital continues to grow, bankers seem certain to demand greater accountability, but as the European banker said: 'They will only be as good as the country itself.'</p>

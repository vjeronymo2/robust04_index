			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Fishing: The premier pastime EVERYONE NEEDS a hobby, a consuming but frivolous means of escape from work, career, decorating the house, staring lugubriously at the bank statement and other necessary but uninspiring aspects of life. Without such a passion we become dull and stale. This applies as much to politicians as to anyone else. One of the more dispiriting characteristics of the current breed is how hard they all work, and how little interest they seem to have in anything else. If the health and happiness of the nation increased in proportion to the hours devoted by Cabinet ministers to their papers, we would now live in Nirvana. But we do not, so the whole approach is obviously flawed. I am aware that prime minister John Major loves poring over the cricket averages and cheering on Chelsea football club. But that is insufficient and far too passive. He should beware the example of his hobby-less predecessor, who might have done well to take up hot-air ballooning or clay pigeon shooting. At least Edward Heath had his sailing and tinkling at the piano, while Harold Wilson had golf as well as his famous affection for Huddersfield Town. Actually, I hope Major does not take up golf. Too many of our prime ministers have professed a fondness for this worthy but dull game - among them Asquith, Bonar Law, and Ramsay MacDonald. In any event, I believe the dicky state of his knees would preclude it. This handicap is a shame, for walking is a respectable pastime for a PM. Baldwin combined it with what the Dictionary of National Biography calls 'an affection for the atmosphere and simple fare of old country inns.' Somehow, I cannot see Major emulating Palmerston, who loved horse-racing and killing animals in equal measure. Lord Aberdeen's passion - otter-hunting - would hardly be acceptable today. Pitt the Younger drank port, and Canning wrote poetry - neither of which seems quite in character for the present premier. Balfour listed motoring as his recreation, but no one could motor for pleasure in this age. It is a disturbing fact that only two of our prime ministers were serious fishermen - Neville Chamberlain and the former Sir Alec Douglas-Home. I fancy that MacMillan may have dabbled a little, for the other day I found a photograph of him in tweeds and flat cap, rod in hand, beside a famous Irish salmon river. But I suspect that shooting creatures was more in his line. The fact that Chamberlain had a 6lb Test trout to his credit suggests that he was no mean performer. There is a touching account in a book by John Bennie of a weekend by the Test, at which Chamberlain was a guest. The PM fished all day for salmon and trout, caught the biggest fish, drank several glasses of port, and 'in his enthusiasm reminded me much of a schoolboy on a weekend holiday.' It was May 1939; war, resignation, and death were just around the corner. A few months before that weekend, Chamberlain had returned from Munich waving his piece of paper. Hardy Brothers, the tackle-makers, presented him with a 10 ft Rogue River fly rod - 'as a mark of esteem and appreciation for his determined efforts in averting a World War,' the inscription on it reads. I handled the rod recently at an auction in London (it was bought by a member of the Chamberlain family for Pounds 2,000), and wondered if that inscription had troubled him. The champion prime ministerial angler is Lord Home of the Hirsel. In his volume of sporting memoirs, Border Reflections, this most modest of demon fishermen hardly bothers to mention the capture of salmon to 38lb and sea trout to 16lb. He allows himself no more than one boast: an account of how, having left all his baits at home, he carved a lure from a piece of driftwood and caught six salmon with it. He is a trout man, too - 'so give me a light trout rod, and the dry fly, and a stream which rises clear through moor or meadow, and I ask no more of the day.' Now, that is the prime minister for me] So, it is clear that Major should take up fishing. He might find wading rivers after salmon and trout a bit arduous, but he could sit comfortably in a boat, or by a lake; and since he would be able to command access to the best waters, he would surely catch something, if the detectives kept their heads down. Above all, the agonies and ecstasies of fishing would surely provide him with a new and enviable sense of proportion about the cares of his great office.</p>

			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / International Company News: Singer in China hire-purchase venture ALMOST a century and a half after it pioneered the hire purchase system in the US, the Singer sewing machine group is to try the same idea in China's booming retail market. Singer Credit, a company jointly owned by Singer and its Hong Kong-listed parent Semi-Tech (Global), has formed a hire-purchase joint venture company with China's largest savings bank, the Industrial &amp; Commercial Bank of China (ICBC). The primary focus of Singer Trust &amp; Credit (Shanghai) will be to develop sales for Singer's growing retail network in China, rather than to become a profitable business in itself. Singer will have opened 12 retail outlets in China by the end of this year. Mr Shen Ruo Lei, president of the Shanghai Branch of ICBC, who attended yesterday's signing ceremony, said: 'This joint venture company is the first of this type (in China) and will become the forerunner of the hire purchase business in China.' Consumer spending in China has been rising steeply, with retail sales up 25.4 per cent year-on-year in April.</p>

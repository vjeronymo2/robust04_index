			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Caterpillar strike widens THE United Auto Workers union of the US is to widen its three-month strike against Caterpillar, the world's largest maker of earth-moving equipment. The decision came after Caterpillar offered last week to end its lock-out of 5,650 workers this weekend. The company's move was aimed at bringing the union back to the bargaining table. But the union says it wants to maximise pressure on Caterpillar to win an industry 'pattern' contract, comparable with settlements at similar companies. It will send the locked-out workers on strike. The union believes that allowing locked-out workers to return to the job would prolong the partial strike by 2,400 of its members, which began on November 4. However, the UAW accepted the company's invitation to resume talks next week.</p>

The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, called the  criticism "improper."    The two countries agreed to promote the trade talks on  schedule in line with a bilateral accord, the official said.    "Criticism against counterparts in negotiations will serve  only as a negative factor in talks," he said.    Senior White House officials expressed Tuesday frustration  about the stalemated discussions and indicated that the United  States has given up hopes of getting a deal through negotiations  with Japanese Government bureaucrats.    Bowman Cutter, the White House official in charge of  overseeing the bilateral talks, said it is time to move them  beyond the confines of the bureaucracy, saying "sooner or later  there has to be the capability to deal with people with  political responsibility."</p>

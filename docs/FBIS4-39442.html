			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Yuriy Kozlov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 7 Jun -- The text of the agreement on  partnership and cooperation between the Russian Federation and  the European Union is finally agreed and the necessary  procedures for it to be signed have begun. That is what  Grigoriy Karasin, head of the Russian Foreign Ministry  Information and Press Department, told today's briefing for  Russian and foreign correspondents. He spoke about the results  of the consultations held in Moscow yesterday. Heads of Foreign  Ministry political departments from Greece, Belgium, and Germany  took part in the talks.    Karasin said that no effort would be spared to ensure that  the agreements are signed during the meeting of the European  Council's heads of states and governments of the European Union,  which will take place on the Greek island of Kerkira on 24-25  June 1994.    The talks participants, the official spokesman of the  Russian  foreign policy department said, also discussed the problem of  nuclear non-proliferation on the Korean Peninsula.  Representatives of the European Union, he said, expressed  concern at tension increasing there because of North Korea's  unwillingness to achieve a comprehensive settlement. In its  turn, the Russian side drew attention to the importance of  working on the idea of convening an international conference  with the participation of the Russian Federation, the United  States, China, Japan, North Korea, the Republic of Korea, and  also representatives of the United Nations, and the IAEA, so  that it could discuss the problem of security in and a  non-nuclear status for the Korean Peninsula.    During discussion of the situation in the former Yugoslavia,  Grigoriy Karasin continued, it was noted that there was a  coincidence of views on and approaches to the situation in  Bosnia- Herzegovina. It was agreed that that there is a need  for the Russian Federation, the European Union, and the United  States to step up efforts with a view to moving closer to a  political solution.    Other topical international problems were also thoroughly  discussed. Among them were the situation in the Near East and  the implementation of the Israeli-Palestinian agreement, the  situation in the Republic of South Africa following the first  general elections, relations between Russia and the Baltic  region and Ukraine, and peace-keeping operations in Georgia and  Nagorno- Karabakh. The representatives of Greece, Belgium, and  Germany said that the European Union intends to assist in  developing and strengthening the CIS.</p>

			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / US durable goods orders fall sharply NEW orders for US durable goods fell by 3.8 per cent last month, a steeper decline than expected on Wall Street, and a sign that the outlook for US manufacturing remains mixed, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. However a separate report showed a 5.4 per cent rise in sales of existing homes last month, evidence that the lowest mortgage rates in two decades are stimulating the housing market. The drop in factory orders mainly reflected a plunge in orders for aircraft and other transport equipment, a notoriously volatile sector. Excluding transport, orders were up 1.3 per cent. Orders have followed an erratic path this year, rising steeply in June after declines in the previous three months. Overall orders are up nearly 8 per cent on July last year. Mr Ron Brown, commerce secretary, thought the figures disappointing but claimed that improving fundamentals, including low interest rates and inflation, would drive the economy ahead. The orders figures were the latest in a series of discouraging economic statistics. Last week's report of a big increase in the trade deficit to Dollars 12.1bn in June, against expectations of about Dollars 8.5bn, led most forecasters to lower estimates of growth in the second quarter to 1 per cent or less. This would be the second quarter of sluggish growth after rapid economic expansion at the end of last year. Many forecasters expect only mild improvement in the outlook later this year. Higher income taxes mandated in the budget, relatively weak consumer and business confidence, and recessionary conditions in overseas markets are seen as restraining growth. However, higher share prices and sharp falls in long-term interest rates are expected to provide an offsetting boost.</p>

			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Poor relations in the Clark family - The feud at Britain's biggest shoe maker THE Clark family is, by nature, publicity shy. So the events of the past weeks at C&amp;J Clark, Britain's largest shoe manufacturer, have come as an unwelcome intrusion into what many regard as a family affair. The latest salvo in the family feud was fired this week with a letter to shareholders setting out reasons why Mr Walter Dickson, the recently appointed chairman, and Mr James Power, a non-executive director, should be ousted at next week's extraordinary meeting. The letter, compiled by the four family members who sit on the Clark board, will cite falling profits and a loss of confidence in Mr Dickson as the reasons for the rebellion. However, there is likely to be a strong emotional appeal to the 500 members of the Clark family, who control some 70 per cent of the company. The appeal will be given added urgency by the news of a possible bid approach backed by Electra Investments, the venture capital specialists. The deal being discussed involves Clark's management consultant, Mr Colin Fisher, making an offer of about Pounds 150m - backed by Electra and other institutions. Mr Fisher is believed to be seeking a more flexible shareholder base, with control in the hands of institutions, in preparation for expansion and eventual flotation. It is clear some family members are smarting at the attempt to wrest control of the company from its traditional base. Not only by the possible bidders, but by increasing influence of non-family members in the company. Mr Dickson, who became chairman in May, is the first non-family member to head the company since the brothers Cyrus and James Clark set up shop in their father's farm in Somerset some 167 years ago. It is almost certain that if a bid was made by Mr Fisher, and accepted, Mr Dickson would remain chairman. The vital question now is whether the majority of the Clark family actually cares if it loses control. Many of the 500 family members are only distantly related to the founding brothers. In fact, only about 10 are direct descendants of Cyrus, with the vast majority owing their stakes to the younger brother James. For many of the Clark shareholders, the company's private status is inconvenient. Many want to sell, but the matched bargain basis on which the shares trade - at a current price of 128p, valuing Clark at Pounds 100m - makes this awkward. Even the 'requisitionists', as the rebel directors are named for calling the egm, have admitted some of the family want to sell shares. Several family members have more pressing needs for the cash, not the least being losses in the Lloyd's insurance market. A mechanism to buy them out is being explored by the requisitionists, although no decision has been taken. For many shareholders, who depend on the Clark dividend for their income the final straw was a 50 per cent cut in this year's interim pay-out from 7p to 3.5p. That reduction followed a 20 per cent decrease for the whole of last year. The cuts were made to pay for the company's wide-ranging restructuring programme. The latest stage of the restructuring was announced only this week, with the closure of the original shoe factory in Street, Somerset. Clark now runs nine factories, almost half of what it had in the heyday of the 1970s. The UK shoe industry has taken a severe beating from the dramatic growth of cheaper imports. According to the British Footwear Manufacturers' Association, the average price of a pair of shoes from China is Pounds 1.75, compared with Pounds 8.45 in Britain. Since 1987, the volume of imports has risen by 50 per cent - and even more in the most recent years of recession when price has become all-important. Seven out of every 10 pairs of shoes purchased in Britain comes from abroad. UK manufacturers cannot hope to compete unless they source from abroad, as Clark is increasingly doing. Yet Clark still makes more than 60 per cent of its shoes in the UK, more than any other British company. The company's defence against imports is its strength in the children's shoe sector, where they have had less effect. Against such a background it is not surprising that Clark has seen operating profits tumble from Pounds 39m to Pounds 28m on sales of Pounds 594m (Pounds 606m) for the year to January 1992. The recent boardroom split only heightens the company's difficulties and employees are beginning to feel the strain. 'It is like one of those management games,' said one who preferred to remain anonymous. 'Someone keeps handing you problem cards and saying 'now, you deal with that'.'</p>

			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Algeria to hear price of debt rescheduling: Francis Ghiles previews talks next week with the Paris Club of official creditors Algeria will meet its chief western creditors in Paris next Tuesday to discuss the terms under which it will reschedule the Dollars 14.5bn of its foreign debt that it owes to foreign governments. The principal debt repayments to be covered fall due between April 1 this year and March 31 next, the period covered by the standby agreement Algeria reached with the International Monetary Fund last month, due to be approved by its board today. The repayments amount to an estimated Dollars 3.4bn, to which the Algerians might wish to add Dollars 800m in interest payments due over the next year. Repayments would be spread over 15 years with eight years' grace. Algeria last reached agreement with the IMF three years ago. But circumstances have changed. The country's economy has deteriorated sharply as a result of the bloody civil strife which followed the suspension of elections the Islamic Salvation Front was poised to win in January 1992, the decline in the price of oil and the government's decision to reverse gear on reforms aimed at liberalising the economy launched in 1989 and suspended late in 1991. The new IMF agreement envisages a standby loan of Dollars 625m and contingency financing of Dollars 375m, extended because of the decline in the price of oil. Hydrocarbon exports account for more than 95 per cent of Algeria's foreign income. Among the measures included in the agreement and already implemented are: A devaluation of the dinar. It is not clear whether further devaluations are required beyond the 40 per cent devaluation against the US dollar on April 10, the date the IMF received Algeria's letter of intent. Dismantling the state monopoly on foreign trade. This has already led to the abolition of the ad hoc ministerial committee which, since July 1992, has alone been entitled to decide on all requests for imports. Discrimination against imports by the private sector, which have been such a feature of the past two years, have been abolished. Exporters will be allowed to retain 50 per cent of their foreign earnings, in foreign currency accounts in Algeria. Adjustments in the price of food and energy prices which were raised by 40 per cent before the dinar was devalued. Three key foodstuffs, semolina, flour and milk, have been exempted. Liberalisation of prices of farm inputs and fertilisers. Foodstuffs imports accounted for 25 per cent of last year's total import bill of Dollars 9.5bn. The stabilisation programme aims to reduce the budget deficit as a percentage of gross domestic product from last year's figure of 9.2 per cent to 3.3 per cent. One third of last year's budget deficit was accounted for by funds aimed at recapitalising loss-making state enterprises which were not restructured. The agreement also includes measures aimed at reducing monetary growth from 21.2 per cent last year to 14 per cent, and at containing salary increases, a sensitive issue because the support of the trades union movement is seen as crucial in the battle against radical Moslem groups. Overall, the aim is to contain inflation to 30 per cent. Last year, inflation was officially measured at 20.8 per cent, a figure widely considered an underestimate, and was worsened by constant shortages and siphoning off into the black market of basic products. In a broader sense, the agreement with the IMF aims to turn a real decline in gross domestic product of 2 per cent last year into a rise of 3 per cent in 1994 and 6 per cent in 1995, thus increasing capacity utilisation in industry which was 50 per cent since 1990. Servicing its Dollars 24.7bn foreign debt, virtually all of which is medium- and long-term, last year represented 86 per cent of Algeria's export earnings, a figure it hopes to bring down to less than 30 per cent. After the talks with its Paris Club creditors, the Algerians will ask to meet their commercial bank creditors. Japanese banks, which hold more than half Algeria's commercial bank paper, are known to be unhappy about the prospect of a rescheduling but are playing their cards close to the chest. Overall, the restructuring should bring in Dollars 3.7bn from official creditors and Dollars 600m from the commercial banks. The Algerians hope that the level of export credits does not fall far short of Dollars 3bn. Mr Ahmed Benbitour, the Algerian minister of finance, insisted, in an interview, that 'quick disbursement was vital to ensure that the liberalisation of foreign trade proceeds smoothly and that the exchange rate is kept steady.' He expressed confidence that Dollars 1bn would be disbursed by the IMF, the World Bank and the EU before the end of June. The attitude of the French government to Algeria's debt problems has, over the past three years undergone a remarkable transformation. In 1991, Paris showed little enthusiasm, let alone consistent support, for the government of Mr Mouloud Hamrouche, which brokered the boldest economic and political reforms ever witnessed in Algeria. Today, leading French ministers spare no effort in their support for the Algerian regime. The French foreign minister, Mr Alain Juppe, brought up the issue when he met US President Bill Clinton recently. French policy however is driven as much by fear as by any hope that the IMF package can be implemented.  ---------------------------------------------------        ALGERIAN DEBT: CHANGING CIRCUMSTANCES  ---------------------------------------------------                       TRADE  --------------------------------------------------- US Dollars bn          1993      1994*     1995*  --------------------------------------------------- Current                +1.0     -2.1*      -2.1*  --------------------------------------------------- Export of goods        10.9      9.6 (1)   11.0 (2) &amp; services  --------------------------------------------------- Import of goods         9.5     11.4*      13.0* &amp; services  --------------------------------------------------- (1)  Of which Dollars 8.2bn hydrocarbons based on      average oil price of Dollars 15 per barrel (2)  Of which Dollars 9.5bn hydrocarbons based on      average oil price of Dollars 16.10 per barrel  --------------------------------------------------- *After debt restructuring  --------------------------------------------------- *Forecast  ---------------------------------------------------</p>

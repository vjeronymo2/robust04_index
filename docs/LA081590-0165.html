			<p><P> August 15, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> YUGOSLAVIA BEATS GREECE, 77-67  </P> <P> Yugoslavia clinched a semifinal berth in the World Basketball Championships  today with a 77-67 victory over Greece.  </P> <P> Yugoslavia, which finished the quarterfinal round with a 3-0 record and is 5-1  in the tournament, will be the top seed from its group and on Friday will face  the loser of today's United States-Puerto Rico game.  </P> <P> Greece (1-2, 3-3) still has a chance at making the semifinals if Brazil (0-2,  2-3) can beat the Soviet Union (1-1, 4-1) by at least 22 points tonight. A  Soviet victory or loss by 21 points or less puts it in the semifinals.  </P> <P> Velimir Perosovic led Yugoslavia with 17 points, and Toni Kukoc, the  second-round draft choice this year of the Chicago Bulls, had 13 in limited  minutes.  </P></p>

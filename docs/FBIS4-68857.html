			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Volodymyr Prytula, staff correspondent of MOLOD </F> UKRAYINY, under the rubric "Hello, Simferopol!": "The Chairman's  First `Victory' "]    [Text] The first session of the newly elected Supreme  Council of Crimea opened on 10 May. It is not too early to say  that that day saw the beginning of a new stage in the political  life of the autonomous republic. And it began with a rather  resounding scandal.    The monolithic Russia bloc, which holds a majority in the  Crimean parliament, proved to be made of clay and full of  cracks. The split was caused by disagreement over the candidates  for the office of the chairman of the autonomous republic's  Supreme Council. The scandal itself broke out because Serhiy  Tsekov, one of the candidates for the speaker's office, connived  at concealing from the public that Serhiy Kovalevskyy, a Russia  bloc deputy, had a criminal record. It was learned that S.  Kovalevsky had once been sentenced to eight years of  imprisonment for taking part in a gang rape of a minor girl.  These "revelations," which were initiated by Deputy V.  Mordashov, also a Russia bloc activist, who supported V.  Klychnykov, another candidate of this bloc, nonetheless ended in  the victory of former People's Deputy of Ukraine Serhiy Tsekov,  a physician from Saky, who now heads the Republican Movement of  Crimea [RDK]. Forty-eight of 98 deputies voted for S. Tsekov,  which was enough to elect him chairman of the Supreme Council of  Crimea. For Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov, who supported  Tsekov, this proved a Pyrrhic victory, because it led to a split  in the "presidential" faction of the Russia bloc.    There were strange happenings the following day as well. RDK  activists O. Melnykov and V. Mezhak, who were nominated by the  newly elected speaker and whose candidacies had been approved at  a meeting of Russia bloc deputies, were voted down by  parliament. Undoubtedly, this local crisis in the Supreme  Council of the autonomous republic will be resolved in time. One  could attribute it to the inexperience and "youthfulness" of the  Crimean deputies. But some parliamentarians are already critical  of their colleagues. Deputy Serhiy Shuryha, a well-known  businessman from Sevastopol, told MOLOD UKRAYINA's correspondent  in an interview that as things stand today, the Crimean Supreme  Council in its present composition is far removed from vital  economic problems and could become mired in politicking. Deputy  Lilya Budzhurova, a Crimean Tatar journalist, agrees with him:  "Unfortunately, the majority of the Russia bloc deputies are  aggressive or simply incompetent in many matters that are of  vital importance to parliamentarians." Thus the direction in  which the newly elected parliament of the autonomous republic  will lead the Crimea remains an open question.</p>

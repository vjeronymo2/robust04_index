			<p><P> March 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SECURITY PACIFIC DEAL FOUGHT BY CONSUMER GROUPS  </P> <P> A coalition of California community groups has asked the Federal Reserve to  reject Security Pacific National Bank's attempt to acquire 20% of Mitsui  Manufacturers Bank.  </P> <P> The move is the latest effort by consumer activists to thwart bank mergers that  they contend fail to provide adequate benefits for minority and low-income  consumers.  </P> <P> In a five-page letter sent Monday to a Federal Reserve vice president, the  so-called California Reinvestment Committee contended that Security Pacific's  credit record fails to meet standards under the 1977 federal Community  Reinvestment Act, which requires regulators to examine whether merging  financial institutions provide loans and credit to neighborhood residents.  </P> <P> "In all of 1988, Security Pacific made only three loans to home buyers in  predominantly black South Central Los Angeles," Gail Hillebrand, an attorney  for Consumers Union, one of six community groups opposing the acquisition, said  in a release.  </P> <P> But Dick Warner, a spokesman for Security Pacific, said the bank's Community  Reinvestment Act record was reviewed last fall by regulatory agencies in  connection with its merger with Southwest Bank and "was said to be  satisfactory."  </P> <P> Warner said the total of only three home loans to South Central residents in  1988 was accurate but "do not reflect the current state of affairs." He had no  current numbers, however.  </P> <P> Hillebrand said Security Pacific should follow the lead of Bank of America and  Wells Fargo, which have set $50 million and $25 million, respectively, as goals  for affordable-home lending for minorities and the poor.  </P></p>

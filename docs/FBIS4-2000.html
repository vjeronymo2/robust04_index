			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By the Industrial and Communications Department of the </F> Regional Statistical Bureau: "Remarkable Industrial  Achievements Made by Ningxia in 1993"]    [Text] In 1993, all levels of government and the regional  departments concerned strengthened their organized scheduling  and guidance over industrial production. At the same time,  industrial enterprises strove to overcome the effect caused by  such unfavorable factors as financial strain, soaring raw  material prices, and insufficient transportation capacity, by  deepening their internal reform. Taking the market as a guide,  they vigorously readjusted their product mix and organizational  structure, promoted technical transformation, tapped potentials,  and cut down on raw material consumption. As a result, the  industrial output value for the whole region topped 10 billion  yuan for the first time, and economic efficiency increased  remarkably. In this way, our region realized the goal of  increasing output value, sales, profits, and taxes  simultaneously, thus laying a good foundation for further  development.    Production passed into the realm of accelerated development.  According to preliminary statistics, our region's total  industrial output value reached 12.08 billion yuan in 1993.  With the price factor included, it increased by 13.9 percent  over 1992. The industrial output value of the industries run by  townships and above stood at 11.28 billion yuan, an increase of  12.1 percent. At the same time they were increasing their  production, enterprises speeded up new product development and  product structure adjustments to increase their value. In 1993  all industrial enterprises that practice independent accounting  run by townships and above increased their output value by 3.22  billion yuan, an increase of 43.4 percent over the previous year.    There was good linkup between production and sales. At the  same time that industrial enterprises in our region were firmly  grasping production, they were also developing and broadening  their various sales promotion activities to improve the linkup  between production and sales. In 1993 the industrial  enterprises at the township level and above realized total  industrial sales of 11 billion yuan. With the price factor  included, sales increased by 13.5 percent. The product selling  rate stood at 97.6 percent, an increase of 2.2 percentage points  over 1992. This surpassed the national average rate by 1.2  percentage points. The product selling rate of big and  medium-sized enterprises was as high as 99.1 percent.    Efficiency as a whole picked up, and there was remarkable  improvement in enterprise management and operation. In 1993,  all the industrial enterprises that practice independent  accounting in the region succeeded in raising output value and  sales income by 43.6 percent and 55.1 percent, respectively.  Their profits and taxes increased by 54.7 percent over 1992,  reaching an all-time high. Profits were 184 million yuan, 2.4  times that of 1992. In particular, the big and medium-sized  enterprises that occupy leading positions achieved great results  in turning losses into gains. Sixty-nine enterprises, with a  deficit of 9.33 million yuan in 1992, realized a surplus of 122  million yuan in 1993. Their profits and taxes stood at 700  million yuan, increasing by 82.9 percent over 1992, which  accounted for 71.1 percent of the total profits and taxes of all  industrial enterprises that practice independent accounting, an  increase of 11.2 percent over 1992. Their efficiency improved,  as did their capital utilization result. The reproduction cycle  tended to be normal, the input-output level was strengthened,  and the comprehensive economic index improved. In 1990, the  comprehensive economic efficiency index of industrial  enterprises that practice independent accounting in our region  stood at 76.7 percent, rising by nearly 10 percentage points  over 1992. Looking at six different indexes, their results were  better than those in 1992, with the exception of the industrial  added value rate. The comprehensive economic efficiency index  of big enterprises reached 82.2 percent, increasing by 13.5  percentage points over 1992. The big enterprises surpassed the  levels of industrial enterprises that practice independent  accounting of the whole region in four out of the six indexes.</p>

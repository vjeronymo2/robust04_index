			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: BES to buy properties in Bristol - At a glance Capital Ventures this week launched the West of England Residential business expansion scheme. This will buy up accommodation for students of the University of the West of England, Bristol. Investors are given a contracted exit after five years of Pounds 1.19 for every Pounds 1 invested equivalent to a net annual return for higher rate taxpayers of 13.8 per cent and 9.29 per cent for a lower-rate taxpayer. The university, formerly Bristol polytechnic, has undertaken to reacquire the properties and is cash-backed. The minimum investment is Pounds 2,000 and the issue is limited to Pounds 10m.</p>

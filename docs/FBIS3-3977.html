The spokesman, Mr. Wu Jianmin, noted that an impact had to  caused to Sino-British relations because of the non-cooperative  attitude of the British side on the issue of political reform in  Hong Kong. He added, however, that the Chinese side was willing  to limit as far as possible the negative effects while British  companies carried out business in the Mainland.    Mr. Wu made the remarks in reply to questions on  Sino-British  relations. He said that whether the British Jardine Matheson  had its listing in Hong Kong was its own business. He added  that the Chinese side as well as groups of overseas investors  were confident of the territory's prosperity, stability and  prospects which Mr. Wu noted were the reasons for the vast  inflow of capital into Hong Kong and the Mainland.    On the matter of the new airport in Hong Kong, Mr. Wu  stressed that so long as the memorandum of understanding on the  new airport was strictly observed, talks between the Chinese and  British sides on the issue could make progress and this the  Chinese side expected to achieve.</p>

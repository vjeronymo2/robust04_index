			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Oleg Velichko] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 20 Jan--Addressing a news conference, Prime  Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin has also noted that the situation  with the budget is the root of all problems. "We intend to pay  the most urgent debts--to settle accounts with the military,  industrial, and agro-industrial complexes--and to pay salaries  to budget organizations, as well as to pay for delivery of all  necessary goods to the North", he said.    Chernomyrdin said that the government expects that inflation  will be around 15-18 percent per month during the first six  months of this year; it will be approximately 12-14 percent per  month during the second six months, and it will be reduced to  8-9 percent per month by the end of this year.    At the same time, the head of the government stressed that  inflation "was and will be the main problem". He said that  "everything else depends on how we will solve this problem".  "The rate of inflation is going at a speed opposite to that of  the reforms".    The prime minister said that efforts to stabilize finances  have been undermined by two reasons: on the one hand, by the  structure of the economy and the structural problems that  provoke the stagnation of investment and a production slump, and  on the other hand by actions of the federal bodies of power that  sometimes make promises that nobody can fulfill.    As for the welfare area, Chernomyrdin said it currently  needed in-depth reforms. He noted, however, that it was  necessary to do it without increasing inflation and through a  rational redistribution of state resources--by closing  inefficient producers, stimulating private investments, and  creating new, additional jobs.    Chernomyrdin thinks that the fall in the ruble's exchange  rate represents an objective and an inevitable process. "For  several months running, we kept the ruble's exchange rate  stable," he noted. "In the meantime, the closer correlation  between world and domestic prices makes it necessary to tie the  exchange rate more strictly to the level of inflation".    The head of government said that the new Cabinet would most  likely modify its reform policy. He said that the modification  would consist in the fact that within the framework of  combatting inflation "we would move from one type of measures,  predominantly monetarist, to non-monetarist measures tried and  tested in numerous European countries".    Chernomyrdin specified that this meant, above all, the  creation of real competition in the Russian economy. "It is, in  fact, a measure of the market's great openness toward the world  economy--the removal of artificial restrictions on the access of  foreign goods and capital to Russia", he emphasized.    Chernomyrdin confirmed that "the presidential course toward  in- depth and democratic reforms of the Russian society did  continue, does continue, and will continue". The president and  the Constitution are the main guarantors of this, he said.</p>

			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: International Cocoa Organisation to try for new economic agreement The International Cocoa Organisation's full council meets in London this afternoon in an attempt to find a way forward towards a new economic agreement, writes David Blackwell. Yesterday members were talking individually to Mr Peter Lai, president of the negotiations, to try to narrow the gap between producers and consumers. United Nations-sponsored talks on the pact ended in failure a fortnight ago. The present agreement ends on September 30, and cannot be extended. Today's meeting will decide whether it is worth returning to Geneva for another round of negoatiations.</p>

			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / International Capital Markets: Warrant on Swedish stocks is launched SG Warburg Global Equity Derivatives has launched its first issue of covered warrants on a basket of Swedish stocks. The American-style call warrants are on a basket made up of 50 shares in ASEA, 70 in Ericsson, 80 in Investor, 20 in SSAB and 40 in Volvo. The value of one basket is approximately SKr104,000. One thousand warrants control one basket, and the approximate issue price per warrant is SKr16.3. The issue was targeted on the back of research by Swedish stockbroking firm Haglof and Ponsbach. In December, SG Warburg agreed to buy the research and institutional sales business of Haglof and Ponsbach from Gota Bank. Salomon Brothers has launched its second issue of warrants on the recently-introduced 30-year German government bond. The warrants have a one-year life. The number of UK equity warrant issues has grown by 13 per cent, to 224 from 198, since the start of the year, according to the McHattie Group's latest warrants directory.</p>

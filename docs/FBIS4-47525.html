S.

The two models were then employed to calculate the  scattering of ultra-short and acoustic waves in the stratosphere  at small angles, where 0 &lt; _u_ &lt;&lt; /2. The  calculations  from these two models were then compared with those obtained  from the model of scattering by locally isotropic turbulence  with the Kolmogorov spectrum. This problem has a direct bearing  on wave propagation over the horizon, in the shadow region,  where the diffraction field is negligible. For both of the LAS  models, the scattering cross-section increases proportionally to  the wavelength of incident radiation. It was shown that  accounting for actual temperature and wind velocity fluctuation  spectra and anisotropy increases the scattering cross-section in  the mirror direction in comparison with the locally isotropic  turbulence model, for which this scattering value was -11/3.  This increase is especially significant for long acoustic waves.  It was also shown that the scattering of sound by wind velocity  fluctuations plays a more significant role than scattering by  temperature fluctuations. The potential increase in acoustic  pulse length during scattering was estimated. It should be noted  that the calculations of the effect of anisotropy and spectral  behavior presented in the tables are extremely preliminary and  require subsequent experimental refinement. The models described  can serve as a basis for planning and interpreting experiments  on the remote sounding of atmospheric structures. Figures 2,  tables 2; references 21: 7 Russian, 14 Western.</p>

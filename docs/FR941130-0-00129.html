			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Section 380.31(c) states that if an operator receives a booking for which he or she does not have possession of or a contract for a game ticket, the operator must return that participant's money within 3 days, unless the participant has authorized the operator in writing to retain the payment while the operator seeks additional tickets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Sections 380.32(s), 380.33(a)(5) and 380.33(e) state that if Super Bowl game tickets are not supplied when promised, the affected participant must be sent a refund of the price of the entire charter package within 14 days after the return flight.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the Super Bowl rules in Part 380, the Department has a policy statement at 14 CFR section 399.87 which states that it shall be an unfair or deceptive practice within the meaning of section 411 of the Federal Aviation Act [now 49 U.S.C. &sect;41712] to advertise or sell an air tour that is promoted as including a ticket to the Super Bowl game unless the operator has tickets or contracts for tickets in the manner described in 14 CFR 380.18a (see above). The principal purpose of this policy statement is to reach tours operated on scheduled air service, which are not covered by the Part 380 charter rules. The Part 399 policy statement mirrors section 380.18a, but does not include the other Part 380 provisions described above. Most importantly, it does not include the requirement that the entire tour price be refunded if a game ticket is not provided.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Like current section 399.87, the new rule tentatively proposed in the ANPRM would apply to tours on all forms of air transportation, not just charters. Like the existing Super Bowl charter rules in Part 380, it would require the tour operator to refund the entire tour price to any participant who does not receive a promised event ticket, even if the tour were not on a charter. The proposed rule would also pick up the procedures of section 380.31(c) of the charter rule, which requires an operator to refund any money received for a booking within 3 days if the operator has no contract for an event ticket for that person, unless the person has authorized the operator in writing to retain the payment while the operator seeks a ticket.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Comments on the ANPRM  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department received comments from 11 organizations and 7 individuals. The great majority of the comments favored adoption of a rule in this area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On the subject of the type of special event that should be covered by the rule, several of the comments discussed only sports events as the context for the rule. Other commenters stated that the context of the rule should be broader than that. The American Society of Travel Agents (ASTA) said that it should apply to all events where a separately-purchased ticket is necessary for admission to the event. The RG Travel Companies, which were involved in sending 1,700 Wisconsin fans to the 1994 Rose Bowl, stated that the rule should cover any special event ``where a good possibility exists that the demand for tickets will exceed the supply&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*'' In a similar vein, the Pasadena Tournament of Roses commented that the rule should apply to any event with limited admission. The National Tour Association (NTA, representing motorcoach tour operators) and Congressman Robert Andrews of New Jersey expressed the opinion that the rule should not be limited to sports events. Ms. Arlene Caldwell said that the rule should cover any tour that claims to include a ticket to the event, and Mr. Donald Hamilton stated that it should apply to any event for which tour packages are sold.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All of the commenters that expressed an opinion on whether the rule should apply to both charter and scheduled transportation felt that it should apply to both forms of air service. Those commenters were the RG Travel Companies, NACA, the NHL, ASTA, the NCAA, FBA, the Pasadena Tournament of Roses, and the Wisconsin Attorney General.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

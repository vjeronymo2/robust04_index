			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Buenos Aires, 1 Jun (NA) -- Tucuman Governor  Ramon "Palito" Ortega admitted today that his province has a  monthly deficit of 6.5 million pesos. He blames this situation  on the signing of the Fiscal Pact with the federal government  and on the transfer of federal schools to the provincial  government.    Ortega indicated that his province has a "deficit" because  of  "the non-collection of revenues following the signing of the  Fiscal Pact, which caused a social security deficit of 3.5  million pesos."    The governor also blamed the situation on the transfer of  federal schools to the provincial government and on salary  increases for teachers. He emphasized that the latter measures  increased the monthly deficit to 6.5 million pesos. [passage  omitted]</p>

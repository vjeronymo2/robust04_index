			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / International Company News: Partner sought for Cologne Re Colonia, Germany's third biggest insurance group, confirmed yesterday that it was holding talks which could lead to an international strategic alliance for Cologne Re, its reinsurance subsidiary. Mr Claas Kleyboldt, Colonia's chairman, said that the talks were taking place with a number of companies but that as yet there was no preferred partner for the match. He was speaking in Cologne as Colonia - now a subsidiary of the French Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP) - reported pre-tax profits up by nearly a quarter for 1993. He stressed that under no circumstances would Colonia sell its 75 per cent direct and indirect holding in Cologne Re, nor would it contemplate a full merger with another party. The only requirement was that the partner pursued a similar strategy to that of the German company, Kleyboldt said. He refused to comment on reports that the company, the fourth largest reinsurance group in the world with gross income of DM4.5bn (Dollars 2.8bn) in 1992, would forge links with either General Corp Re or Employers Reinsurance Corp, two US reinsurance companies. Although the talks are apparently at an early stage, they highlight the move towards co-operation and consolidation in the global reinsurance industry. Last week, for example, Suez, the French holding company, agreed to sell Abeille Re, its French reinsurer, to Scor, France's largest reinsurance group, as part of the disposal of the Victoire group of insurance businesses. The deal valued the reinsurer at more than FFr2bn (Dollars 366m). UAP confirmed that in principle it would not be opposed to Cologne Re forming a strategic alliance with an international partner in the reinsurance field. Neither General Re nor Employers Reinsurance could be contacted immediately for comment yesterday.</p>

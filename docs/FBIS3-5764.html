			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  articles from ROK vernacular papers published on 10 March on the  U.S.-ROK trade meetings held on 8 and 9 March and the annual  trade policy report released by the U.S. Trade Representative,  USTR, on 8 March.    The independent-moderate Seoul MAEIL KYONGJE SINMUN in  Korean, which focuses on economic issues, publishes on page 2 a  1,000-word article by Yi Tong-chu reviewing the ROK-U.S. trade  meeting. The article reports the United States had a much  stronger tone than in previous meetings in its demands and that  the meeting was held amid worry and concern over the effect of  the Super 301 restoration on the ROK.    The article says our government had been optimistic that the  meeting would focus on "the development of general cooperation"  but the U.S. side extinguished that optimism by "raising  individual subjects, such as the protection of the intellectual  property right, IPR, and further opening of the motor vehicle  market."    The article reports the United States demanded strengthened  regulation on software reproduction and revision of our revised  IPR regulations in the IPR sector; and lower tariffs, lower  domestic tax, and amendment of automobile taxes in the motor  vehicle sector.    The article reports that in response to the U.S. demands,  our  side explained that we are strengthening investigation of  copyright violations and asked the United States to drop the ROK  from the priority surveillance list for the IPR and advocated  our position that the ROK has already made substantial tariff  cuts on motor vehicle imports.    The article concludes that the meeting only reconfirmed the  two sides' positions and predicted stronger trade pressure from  the United States.    The MAEIL KYONGJE SINMUN publishes on page 4 a 300-word  article by Washington correspondent Kim Kyong-su on the USTR's  annual trade policy report. The article reports "the USTR  positively appraised ROK's contribution to a successful Uruguay  Round, but urged early implementation of laws to protect  patents, trademarks, and copyrights."    The moderate Seoul HANGUK ILBO in Korean publishes on page 5  a 1,000-word article by Washington correspondent Chong Chin-sok  on USTR's annual trade policy report. The article reports that  the USTR reported the ROK has taken positive action in lowering  tariffs on agricultural and manufactured goods, but stressed  continued pressure on the IPR and motor vehicle sectors.    The pro-government Seoul SEOUL SINMUN in Korean publishes on  page 8 a 500-word article on USTR's annual trade policy report.  The article also reports that "the USTR positively appraised  ROK's opening effort, but urged improvement in the IPR and motor  vehicle sectors."</p>

			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / International Company News: Gloom settles over Finnish banks  -Christopher Brown-Humes reports as the sector is hit by recession KANSALLIS-Osake-Pankki, Finland's leading commercial bank, yesterday inaugurated what will probably be the gloomiest reporting season in Finnish banking history. Unitas, the country's number two bank, is expected to reveal a loss of at least FM3bn (Dollars 528m), after a FM128m profit in 1991, and even bigger deficits could be reported by Skopbank and the Savings Bank of Finland, both of which are now under state control. Losses for the whole sector will amount to FM15bn-FM20bn, more than twice the 1991 level, with non-performing loans estimated at a staggering FM80bn. At the heart of the crisis lies the severe Finnish recession, exacerbated by high real interest rates, which have brought share and property values down sharply in the past three years and pushed many small and medium-sized companies into bankruptcy. Credit losses and non-performing loans have soared. True, interest rates have come down during the autumn, improving the banks' margins and share prices have risen strongly since October. But there has been no let up in the pace of bankruptcies and the amount of non-performing loans has risen. The scale of the difficulties has meant that even the extensive rationalisation measures and major staff reduction programmes being carried out by many of the banks have made little impact. 'The amount of bad loans is more than the equity of most of the banks. The value of their shares depends on the extent to which the government is prepared to help them out,' says Mr Jari Eklund, analyst with KOP Investment Research. What made yesterday's KOP statement particularly gloomy was the assessment that it will take years for the banking system's problems to be resolved. 'Normal levels of profitability will hardly be reached until the late 1990s,' said Mr Pertti Voutilainen, KOP chairman and chief executive. He has already indicated that KOP is unlikely to return to profit before 1995. This year the slump in the domestic market will continue, despite the improved outlook for exports, and it is by no means certain that GNP, which has fallen 10 per cent in the past two years, will be positive. The problems in the corporate sector will continue, particularly for companies exposed to the devaluation of the Finnish markka such as importing companies or those with big foreign currency loans. At the same time, greater difficulties are expected in the household sector, with Finnish unemployment now at a record 18.6% level. Many people in the industry suspect the government may have to offer even more financial help than it has indicated so far. Last's year FM20bn guarantee fund has been severely depleted and FM8bn in preference capital fully utilised. Last week parliament approved a further FM20bn in assistance for the banks in 1993, and there has been talk of a further FM10bn being made available in due course. The best that can be hoped is that things will not get any worse. But for the banking sector to start pulling out of the crisis, there has to be a broader economic recovery. Fortunately there are positive signs, including rising exports and the recent decision by the Bank of Finland to cut base rates to 7.5 per cent. In the meantime one of the government's main priorities will be resolving the future of the Savings Bank of Finland and Skopbank, the central bank of the savings banks. Last year Unitas pulled out of talks which might have led to it merging with both these ailing groups. Then, several weeks ago, KOP revealed that it had made contact with the state about a possible merger with them. This news has alarmed the rest of the banking sector, partly because a combination of the three banks would give KOP an estimated 40 per cent share of the overall market. The other banks also say the move would distort competition, if it was effected with the aid of non-repayable state support. They believe a fairer solution would be for the healthy parts of the two groups to be divided among all of them, with the bad loans being hived off into a separate unit. It is not just a question of Skopbank and the Savings Bank of Finland being helped out. KOP has already indicated it will almost certainly need a capital injection this year, and may well need direct support from the government to prevent its capital adequacy falling below statutory minimums. By contrast, Unitas shows every sign of wanting to pull through its difficulties without government support - but it will want to be sure that its competitive position is not endangered in the process.</p>

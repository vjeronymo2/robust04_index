			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IBM DROPS TV ADS FOR PGA TOURNEY TO PROTEST CLUB'S EXCLUSION OF BLACKS  </P> <P> IBM will not run television ads during the PGA Championship next month because  of racial exclusion in the membership of the all-white Shoal Creek Country  Club, site of the golf tournament, an IBM official said.  </P> <P> IBM spokeswoman Gina Chew-Holman said that when the corporation learned of the  racial issue, "we decided it would not be an appropriate vehicle for our  advertising, supporting (the club) even indirectly."  </P> <P> Officials with the club, in Shelby County near Birmingham, said that it does  not have any policy barring blacks from membership and that blacks have been  guests. But the racial practices of the country club became the subject of  widespread news reports when the club's founder, Hall Thompson, told the  Birmingham Post-Herald that the club would not be pressured into accepting  blacks.  </P> <P> Thompson later said he was quoted out of context and apologized to those he  offended.  </P></p>

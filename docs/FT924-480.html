			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Profits taken in a less active session THE UK stock market paused for breath yesterday after five consecutive sessions of rising share prices. Trading volume fell back and profits were taken both in the blue chip leaders and in the second line stocks. But stock index futures remained at a high premium over the cash market and both the FT-SE 100 and the FT-SE Mid 250 Indices staged successful rallies from the day's lows. There were signs that, with few fund managers interested in selling shares against the highly bullish trend of the market, stock is becoming hard to find. Marketmakers wanted to see shares lower but futures traders seeking to arbitrage could not find blue chip shares. In early trading, equity prices were destabilised by a temporary failure in the Stock Exchange Topic information and price-quoting electronic system. But after dipping to the 2,818 area, the FT-SE Index rallied to close at 2,827.4 for a net fall of 14.6. The FT-SE Mid 250, nearly seven points off at midsession, cut its loss to 2.8 for a final reading of 2,842.6. Firmness in the US dollar helped oil shares and some other Wall Street-influenced stocks towards the close. However, the Footsie was held back by selling pressure on a handful of leading shares. Seaq-reported volume contracted to 552.7m shares from the 815.1m seen on Tuesday, when retail, or customer, business stayed high and was worth Pounds 1.46bn. Retail business has exceeded Pounds 1bn daily since mid-September when sterling's departure from the ERM triggered a rise in the Footsie now extended to around 20 per cent. Turnover in stock index futures virtually halved from the previous day, but the March FT-SE Index contract remained around 44 points premium to the cash market - fair value, allowing for dividend and financing flows, stands at about 19 points. Business in traded options also fell sharply, returning a total of only 13,772 contracts, against 42,002 previously. The FT-SE option contract saw barely more than 5,000 contracts dealt, compared with 10,825 on Tuesday. Among individual contracts, Amstrad, heading the actives list with 1,340 contracts transacted, was the only name to trade more than 1,000 lots. Bass (748) and Storehouse (549) were the nearest rivals.</p>

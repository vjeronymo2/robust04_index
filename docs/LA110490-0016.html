			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> ZOO SEEKS NEW HOMES FOR ANIMALS;  </P> <P> SHUTDOWN: ABOUT 200 CREATURES ARE UP FOR ADOPTION BECAUSE OF BUDGET CUTS. AN  ELDERLY PAIR OF ORANGUTANS WILL BE SEPARATED.  </P> <P> Major, a 1,200-pound polar bear, will lose his home this month. So will elderly  orangutans Stanley and Betty, and a skinny Siberian tiger named Sasha. The  85-year-old Stone Zoo is closing because of state budget cuts.  </P> <P> "You can't help (but) develop attachments to the animals," said Mark Goldstein,  the zoo's director. "You think of them as individuals."  </P> <P> The zoo in this Boston suburb was already running on a shoestring when its  budget was slashed 30% because of the state's financial problems. Officials  decided to close the zoo Nov. 12 rather than keep the animals in shoddy  conditions.  </P> <P> "There are things worse than no zoo, like a bad zoo," Goldstein said.  </P> <P> About half the 200 or so animals will go to Franklin Park Zoo, the larger of  the two facilities run by MetroParks Zoos. Others will be taken in by  menageries around the country.  </P> <P> But some are just too old or too big for easy relocation.  </P> <P> "For some, it will take months to find them a good home," Goldstein said, "but  we won't let them end up in private collections and we hope none will have to  be euthanized."  </P> <P> Large carnivores are expensive to feed and maintain, said John Linehan, curator  of mammals for the MetroParks Zoos. Major, for example, eats about 14 pounds of  meat and biscuits daily -- when he's on a diet.  </P> <P> Sasha has an enzyme problem that keeps her a little skinny. And, though lions  and tigers are increasingly scarce in the wild, they are fairly abundant in  U.S. zoos.  </P> <P> Orangutans Stanley, 31, and Betty, 30, resemble sad-eyed, red-haired Buddhas as  they sit quietly in their separate glass enclosures. But they are more  mischievous than tranquil.  </P> <P> "Betty steals tools and you have to trade them back," Linehan said. "She gets a  brush and starts scrubbing the walls, like we do. She won't go through doors  she wants you to go through. She demands a lot of attention."  </P> <P> The two orangutans have been together 20 years and produced four offspring, but  they'll probably be separated when the zoo closes.  </P> <P> Stanley may go back to Brookfield Zoo near Chicago, his first home. Betty's  future is less clear, since she is old, fat and has an abdominal cyst that has  left her unable to reproduce.  </P> <P> But don't think their separation will leave either ape heartbroken, keepers  said.  </P> <P> "Betty steals Stanley's toys," Linehan said. "Stanley is nice, except when he  wants to have his way with Betty. They won't miss each other."  </P> <P> Wherever he ends up, Stanley will be "happy to have females around," said  Linehan. "He's pretty feisty for his age."  </P> <P> Goldstein hopes that Stone Zoo can be reopened someday. A bill in the  Legislature would take the zoo out of state control and make it a public,  nonprofit corporation similar to most other successful zoos nationwide.  </P> <P> But for now, the outlook isn't bright for the zoo's animals or its patrons.  </P> <P> Thelma Dennis, 69, has been a volunteer zoo tour guide for children for the  past 11 years.  </P> <P> "Of course I'm awfully sad," she said. "This is the real thing, or next to the  real thing. Kids can't get the same feeling for an animal on TV that they can  seeing them here."  </P> <P> "We're trying to get kids off the streets and we're taking away the zoos, the  museums," said Goldstein.  </P> <P> "You can be 75 years old and want to take a 3-year-old out for the day," he  added. "I challenge you to find something else you'd both enjoy."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In line with the federal government's directive, the  Nigeria Airways has taken delivery of its Boeing 707 cargo  plane. The plane was seized in Kent, England, over a  controversial debt. The aircraft flew into the country in the  early hours of Thursday [6 January] last week. The return of  the high-revenue yielding aircraft followed successful  negotiation by the Nigeria Airways management led by its  managing director, Mr. Andrew Agom.    This brings to three the number of seized Nigeria Airways  aircraft that have been released by creditors. Mr. Agom said  the authority is doing everything possible to carry out  reorganizations as directed by the government. For this reason,  letters have been sent to those who will replace returning  overseas stations staff. He also said a new flight schedule will  be out by the 17th of this month with the emphasis on the west  coast routes.</p>

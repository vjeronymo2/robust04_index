The effective Q-factor approach used was  asymptotically accurate, which made it possible to reduce the  description of distributed feedback laser generation to a simple  system of balance equations with concentrated parameters. The  features of laser generation with light induced stochastic  distributed feedback are examined. Optical bistability and  generation of ultrashort pulses are possible, which reduces the  threshold. Explicit equations are obtained which are suitable  for practical evaluation of parameters in ultrashort pulse  generation. An overview of experimental results is presented  with analysis of the features and advantages of using  distributed feedback lasers as sources of optical ultrashort  pulses.

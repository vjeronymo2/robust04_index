			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Morning Information Review" newscast] </F>   [Text] Cuban President Fidel Castro returned to Havana from  Cartagena de Indias where he participated in the Fourth  Ibero-American Summit. The last activities by the Cuban chief  of state were separate meetings with Colombian groups that  support Cuba and with Colombian businessmen. The Cuban  President reiterated in Cartagena de Indias that the importance  of the Ibero-American summits stems basically from the fact that  it is the first time the Latin American countries meet without  anyone convoking them.    At a meeting with representatives of Colombian organizations  that support Cuba, Castro referred to the progress and  perspectives of Latin American integration and the so-called  Summit of the Americas, convoked by the United States for later  this year. He called the presence of Cuba in the Ibero-American  summits exceptional because for the first time it is not  excluded. In this regard, he said the support of Mexico, which  hosted the first summit, and the support of other friendly  countries had a lot to do with Cuba's presence at the summit.    The Cuban president noted that the summits have contributed  to combating Cuba's isolation, to creating awareness of the  blockade it has endured, to giving a lesson to the United  States, to increasing Cuba's relations with many countries, and  to enhancing rapprochement among Latin American countries.  Fidel Castro said that currently, there does not exist a true  integration conscience in Latin America, but that the summits  are contributing to this. He said the main obstacle is the  United States, which is attempting to prevent Latin America from  being more independent.    The Cuban chief of state said the Ibero-American summits are  so important that the northern enemy was envious and invented  another summit, precisely in Miami, which it wants to turn into  the capital of Latin America. He reiterated, nonetheless, that  Cuba is not opposed to that summit, despite the fact that he  believes Cuba's exclusion is cowardice. He explained this is  because U.S. Government leaders are afraid of words, ideas, and  truths, which denotes political weakness. Castro noted that he  is not opposed to the summit in Miami because he hopes that the  Latin American countries there will firmly defend the interests  of the region.</p>

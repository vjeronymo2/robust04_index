			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On 21 February, the newspaper TRABAJADORES features  an article by journalist Nicanor Leon Cotayo regarding the  effects of the blockade on health services entitled: "If It  Comes From the United States."    The article is based on the research that Nicanor Leon  Cotayo  has been carrying out for 15 years on the isolationist policy  Washington conducts against Cuba. Leon Cotayo discusses several  issues in collaboration with the Public Health Ministry,  particularly the finance office. The article is especially  significant now that the UN Human Rights Commission is meeting  in Geneva.    Because of the blockade, in one year of this five-year  period, Cuba paid an additional $45 million in health costs.  Cuba could have bought 180 million liters of milk with that  money. Nicanor Leon Cotayo points out that this effect of the  blockade is reflected simultaneously in the increase in the  foreign debt and a greater outlay of hard currency for excessive  transportation costs -- in most cases air transportation -- in  order to ensure the swift delivery of highly critical products.  Despite these difficulties, the article adds, Cuba has preserved  its accomplishments in this sphere regardless of Washington's  systematic efforts to damage our health care system.</p>

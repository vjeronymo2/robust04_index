			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Sentiment improves in spite of further fall in Nikkei LATE arbitrage-related trading pushed share prices lower at the close in dull trading, although a firmer tone in blue chip issues helped to lift sentiment, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei closed 123.34 down at 18,436.37. The index fell to the day's low of 18,376.86 in the morning, but rose to the session's high of 18,670.81 in the afternoon on bargain hunting by investment trusts and index-linked buying. Movements were dominated by index-linked trading led by the futures markets; however, traders said other market indicators reflected a slight change in sentiment. Advances led declines by 624 to 343, with 137 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks improved 3.96 to 1,324.61, while in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 1.27 to 1,057.88. Volume fell to 200m shares from Friday's 350m as large institutional investors refrained from activity. Small-lot bargain hunting of international blue chips by foreigners was noted, as well as light trading by dealers. Leading electricals firmed. Hitachi gained Y14 to Y788 and Toshiba Y11 to Y589. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone rallied Y14,000 to Y614,000. Teac, a manufacturer of magnetic tapes, forged ahead Y100 to Y881 on hopes of a recovery in the US semiconductor market. Dealers said some brokers were targeting semiconductor related high-technology issues as a new market theme. However, Mr Dan Kerrigan at County NatWest said investors would be limited to short-term trading, since the US recovery was forecast to be limited. Amada, a machinery maker, firmed Y10 to Y1,080. Investors were encouraged by hopes of a rise in sales since the company is a potential beneficiary of the government's plan to promote corporate investment in labour-saving machines. Oil-related shares rose on the back of firmer crude oil prices, following an Iranian attack on a rebel base in Iraq. Teikoku Oil added Y9 at Y621 and Arabian Oil Y140 at Y4,740. Some speculative favourites that had been heavily sold last week by investors who had bought on margin recovered on active bargain hunting. Nippon Carbon rebounded Y46 to Y696 and Clarion Y35 to Y790. Banking issues, which also declined sharply last week, lost further ground, although dealers noted that heavy selling had subsided. Industrial Bank of Japan dipped Y20 to Y1,640 and Fuji Bank Y30 to Y1,470. In Osaka, the OSE average retrieved 342.84 to 19,884.85 in volume of 8.6m shares, supported by light buying after seven consecutive days of decline. Defensive issues such as chemicals and pharmaceuticals gained, Ono Pharmaceutical ending Y110 up at Y4,710. Roundup THE Pacific Rim was mixed. Kuala Lumpur, Singapore and Bangkok were closed. HONG KONG receded in low turnover and the Hang Seng index slipped 19.80 to 4,896.90. Turnover came to HKDollars 1.38bn, after HKDollars 2.18bn on Friday. Rumours that Cheung Kong might buy assets from Olympia &amp; York, the troubled Canadian property group, depressed its shares, which shed 30 cents to HKDollars 20.70. Hutchison Whampoa declined 20 cents to HKDollars 14.80 on speculation that it is planning a rights issue. SEOUL's composite index edged up 0.19 to 590.02 in turnover of Won300.51bn, against Won251.4bn during Saturday's half-day session. TAIWAN retreated as political tension in the National Assembly depressed sentiment. The weighted index lost 81.86 or 1.7 per cent to 4,652.10. Turnover was TDollars 11.8bn (TDollars 15.4bn), its lowest since October. MANILA moved ahead as concern about violence ahead of May's presidential election eased. The composite index rose 19.66 to 1,131.43. Turnover fell to 178.9m pesos (217.7m). AUSTRALIA rose on optimism that there would be a cut in interest rates soon. The All Ordinaries index gained 10.9 at 1,576.7 in ADollars 163.2m turnover. BOMBAY lost ground on widespread profit-taking amid fears that the government might intervene to cool the overheated market. The BSE index fell 175.68 or 4.2 per cent to 4,062.57.</p>

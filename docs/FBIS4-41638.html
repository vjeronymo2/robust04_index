			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Marianne Sajdik: "`Ukrainians in Favor of </F> Privatization'"]    [Text] "I have voted against the red dictatorship," a  young man shouted, gesticulating fiercely. A few seconds later  he was arrested by the militia. Election Sunday in Kiev: In  front of the number four ballot station in the prosperous Old  Kiev area, the Ukrainian intelligence service was hanging about  in small groups. Former Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma was the  first to cast his vote in these presidential and municipal  elections, shortly after 0900. Asked by DER STANDARD, why he  had only turned towards Russia during his time in office, Kuchma  said: "When you have only beetroots in the fields and when  petrol cans are empty, you have to go to Moscow."    If he, Kuchma, becomes president, he will make sure there is  a new parliament. Reforms will continue, the Ukraine can do  without humanitarian aid. But the West should find some money  for industry. Russia has driven Ukraine to the wall; for four  months' supply of natural gas, Kiev has had to pay $1 million to  Russia, and $800,000 to Turkmenistan. During his presidency,  Ukraine would become a member of the European Union, Kuchma  said. This would have to happen before 1997, the year when the  president's legislative term ends.    President Leonid Kravchuk came to the ballot station shortly  after 1100. Speaking to DER STANDARD, Kravchuk was convinced  that he will win the elections: "People understand my policy;  like me, they are in favor of privatization, although parliament  is against it." If parliament tried to cut his rights as  president, this could result in a dangerous confrontation,  Kravchuk said.    Kravchuk spoke out in favor of a political and economic  confederation of Belarus, Russia, and the Ukraine. A union of  all Slavic nations would, however, be dangerous, because 30  million Slavs living in the Asian republics would return: "We  cannot take them all in." In addition, the Asian nations might  also form a union, which would not help anyone. In conclusion,  Kravchuk said that so far the West has only promised help  without delivering it.</p>

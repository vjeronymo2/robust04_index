			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Zdenko Vranjes] </F>   [Excerpt] The special expanded session of the Chamber of  Deputies of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna held in Livno  today ended this evening with the adoption of a declaration with  no votes against and two abstentions. This confirmed that the  Chamber of Deputies of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna is the  sole legitimate legislative authority of the Croat people in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and reaffirmed the principles for a political  resolution of the state crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The correctness of the stances and activities of the  legitimate representatives of the Croat people in the search for  a solution to the state crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina has been  reasserted at international peace negotiations on  Bosnia-Herzegovina, the declaration says. Bearing in mind the  present international order and reiterating their lasting  political orientation for peace and a political solution to the  state crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Chamber of Deputies  adopted the principles proposed by the commission headed by Pero  Markovic, chairman of the executive committee of the Croatian  Democratic Union for Bosnia-Herzegovina.    [Begin Markovic recording] The preservation of the state of  Bosnia-Herzegovina as an independent and internationally  recognized state is only possible through the consent of all  three constituent, equal, state-building peoples -- Croats,  Serbs, and Muslims -- and all of them together, through a union  of republics of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Second, the right of the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina  to self-determination and the realization of their statehood and  independence will be guaranteed by the Croat republic of  Herceg-Bosna in the union of republics of Bosnia-Herzegovina  with respect for the right of the other two state-building  peoples -- the Serbs and the Muslims -- to the same on an equal  footing.    Third, all the rights of the members of the Croat nation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina -- regardless of the internal set-up of the  state -- must be guaranteed on its entire territory through an  agreement on peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina, achieved by the  mediation of the international community. By ensuring the  application of the highest international standards governing  human and political rights, we will demand the same for the  other two state-building nations -- the Serbs and the Muslims.  We are in favor of cultural, religious, and national autonomy  and local self-administration for every nation in each of the  three republics.    Fourth, the union of republics of Bosnia-Herzegovina must be  set up as a democratic, multiparty, parliamentary state which  safeguards and guarantees all fundamental rights and freedoms of  each of its state-building nations and citizens irrespective of  their nationality, religion, political affiliation, sex, and  social status.    Five, we support sustained efforts and struggle by the  entire  legitimate political leadership of the Croat people in  Bosnia-Herzegovina for the protection of all national, cultural,  economic, and human rights of the Croats living outside the  areas of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna on the basis of  reciprocity with the other two state-building nations. [end  recording]    In addition to these political principles, the declaration  supports and accepts President Tudjman's peace initiatives and  efforts aimed at halting the war and restoring peace in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia, and welcomes the signing of an  agreement between the Republic of Croatia and the Republic of  Yugoslavia. Those who have not yet accepted President Tudjman's  initiative are called on not to seek a solution to the crisis in  Bosnia-Herzegovina through continuing the war.    The declaration urges observance of international  humanitarian law, supports efforts for the unhindered passage of  humanitarian aid, and condemns every violent act and barbarity  toward historic and cultural heritage.

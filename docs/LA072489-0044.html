			<p><P> July 24, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The breakaway state of Northern Cyprus has jailed 91 Greek Cypriots for their  part in a protest that has soured Greco-Turkish ties before talks on reunifying  the Mediterranean island. The protesters, most of them women, were seized last  week after breaking through the U.N. buffer zone lines in a "walk home" action  last week to mark the 15th anniversary of Turkey's invasion of Cyprus. Of the  108 arrested, 91 were fined and sentenced to three days in jail by the Nicosia  district court. Sixteen women were freed on bail and one girl, aged 14, was  freed unconditionally. Ten refused to comply with bail and were also jailed.  About 100 Greek-Cypriots broke into the U.N. buffer zone west of Nicosia during  another "walk home" over the weekend but were stopped before reaching Turkish  lines.  </P></p>

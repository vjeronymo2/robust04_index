			<p>BFN     [Text] An editorial in today's newspaper TRABAJADORES  states: All the activities of the labor union movement converge  in the struggle for efficiency. The traditional Assemblies of  Production and Services will be replaced by a new type of  meeting that will have the same sincere, critical, and  self-analytical spirit established in the workers parliaments  and will be called Assemblies for Economic Efficiency.    TRABAJADORES underscores that an immediate task for labor  union organizations is the implementation of plans and measures  and the solutions suggested by workers during the workers  parliaments. Economically feasible criteria and suggestions  should be grouped according to each level of labor union  organization to unleash the consequent action by enterprises,  branches, sectors, provinces, and organizations, so that  everyone knows his specific responsibility.    In many work centers where concrete measures have been  implemented, absenteeism has begun to decrease, interest in  production has been reanimated, and workers make an effort to  cut costs.    The Assemblies for Economic Efficiency, which will be held  periodically, will follow up on the ideas and suggestions of the  workers parliaments. The editorial goes on to say: We must  maintain a constant teaching and learning presence at the  centers and each contact must leave an impression on the  workers. The parliaments taught us that the prestige of  representing the class that governs the country is maximized  through the active efforts of the labor union leader, wherever  he may be, through effective communication with workers, and  through the use of vivid language that conveys information,  concepts, and ideas.</p>

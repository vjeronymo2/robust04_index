			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / International Company News: An unpromising corporate couple's marriage still flies - Nikki Tait examines the partnership between American International Group and International Lease Finance Corp IN THE world of corporate marriages, a large, conservative insurance group and go-go aircraft leasing business would seem an unpromising couple. But, two-and-a-half years after New York-based American International Group and California's International Lease Finance Corporation tied the knot, the sceptics have fallen conspicuously silent. Yesterday, announcing annual results, AIG noted a 'record' year for ILFC. The achievement was made all the more remarkable by ghastly airline industry conditions and turmoil beseting ILFC's Shannon-based rival, GPA. The results are only the latest outward sign of ILFC's success: its portfolio has doubled to over 200 jets during the past 30 months, while a Dollars 4.1bn order for 82 new aircraft, placed last December, was one of the few happy moments enjoyed by aircraft manufacturers recently . Since matters are seldom simple in any leasing business, can business really be as good as it looks ? And, if yes, how has the curious coupling to an insurance colossus helped? Scepticism abounded when AIG's Dollars 1.26bn purchase of ILFC was announced in June 1990. AIG, one of the world's biggest commercial insurers, is renowned for financial discipline, firm overseas links, and a sharp-tongued chief executive, Mr Maurice 'Hank' Greenberg. ILFC, by contrast, is a corporate stripling. It was born 20 years ago, when two Los Angeles-based college friends, Steven Udvar-Hazy and Louis Gonda, acquired a DC-8 and leased it to a Mexican airline. When AIG offered to buy, ILFC employed just 25 people and had posted 1989 profits of Dollars 61.2m after-tax. Given the cyclical character of the airline business and questions about residual aircraft values, Wall Street wondered if Mr Greenberg had taken leave of his senses. From ILFC's viewpoint, the desire for corporate parentage was simple: it knew capital would be needed to expand its business and build up the jet portfolio. But it feared Wall Street would be skittish about the airline industry at the very moment when money was most in demand. 'AIG, in one clean sweep, became our equity source,' says the company today. ILFC's appeal to AIG was a little more subtle. 'AIG felt their domestic insurance operations would not grow as quickly as our business,' Mr Udvar-Hazy explains. 'By augmenting their financial services division with a company which had fast-growing earnings they could stabilise that end of their business.' Analysts make the point a little differently. 'ILFC should not be viewed as part of AIG's basic insurance or even financial services businesses, but rather as an investment vehicle for a large company in a declining interest rate environment,' suggested a recent Salomon Brothers circular. This 'investment' aspect to the marriage seems to have been borne out by the minimal operational integration over the past two years. ILFC remains firmly planted on the west coast, a continent away from AIG's headquarters, employing just 43 people. The lessor's top management has stayed in place. And contact between the two businesses is limited to top-level executives. 'They've had many opportunities to put a financial watchdog here . . . that's never been done,' says Mr Udvar-Hazy. 'So long as we meet the financial targets that have been established, we're effectively an autonomous subsidiary.' To keep the marriage sweet, ILFC had to perform, and AIG had to provide, financial security. AIG infused Dollars 125m of additional equity into the business at the time of the purchase and has committed another Dollars 200m, the last tranche coming in the final quarter of 1992. To alleviate its own shareholders' concerns, AIG made clear it would not underpin any of ILFC's debts, which run to over Dollars 4bn. But the solid corporate parentage still encouraged some upgrading of ILFC's debt rating. Moody's, for example, raised its rating of the senior debt by one notch to a2, and the commercial paper to Prime-1, its highest rating. ILFC's ability to perform in the current market is more surprising, given all the red ink in the airline industry and the fact that a glut of aircraft means lease rates are soft. Mr Udvar-Hazy's response is that any airline leasing business becomes a financing source for carriers in the tough times, and the lessor's credit-worthiness is all-important. 'Airline balance sheets are hurting,' he says. 'So those carriers that do need aircraft generally have to resort to off-balance sheet financing, using someone else's financial statements.' He adds: 'It's true we've had pressure on lease rates, but that has been more than offset by the lower cost of financing. We may have seen a 10 to 15 per cent erosion of lease rates, but we've probably had a 20 to 25 per cent decrease in our borrowing costs. In 1992, ILFC had the highest core leasing margins that we've had in 20 years.' But what about the reliability of airline payments and the danger that aircraft can be tied up in bankruptcy or administration processes? Mr Udvar-Hazy's response is more pragmatic. He notes all ILFC aircraft are owned 'free and clear' - that is, without the company's debt-providers having any mortgage interest on the aircraft themselves - and argues that this provides flexibility vis-a-vis customers. There is a firm policy of pulling back aircraft from troubled lessees at the first opportunity. As a result, 86 per cent of the fleet is leased outside the US, up from 60 per cent, and only one aircraft is operated by a bankrupt US carrier - by TWA. But business can still be nerve-wracking. 'We beat the administrator at Air Europe by nine minutes,' remembers Mr Udvar-Hazy. 'We had four aircraft leased there, and we filed our default notice and court papers just ahead of the administrator. We got our aircraft out of there in 24 hours, but some people had aircraft stuck at Gatwick for 13 months.' As for profits, ILFC made Dollars 139.7m before tax in 1991, against Dollars 123m in the previous 13-month period. In the first nine months of 1992, the figure rose to Dollars 165.3m, against Dollars 110m in 1991. But the company changed its depreciation policies in 1992, writing down the value of aircraft more slowly. This lowered the depreciation charge - and bucked profits - to the tune of Dollars 28.4m in the first nine months of 1992. Perhaps the most interesting question is how long ILFC can continue on this path? Mr Udvar-Hazy acknowledges that, once the company has built up a portfolio of 325 to 375 jets - that is by the mid-1990s - the dynamics will change. 'I don't think we can handle 400 or more aircraft, the way we're set up now in terms of administrative support', he says. Growth, he adds, should continue as more wide-bodied aircraft enter the portfolio. But, unless the business is radically restructured, the rate will probably slow. But Mr Ed Matthews, head of AIG's financial services division, discourages the notion that ILFC will have then outlasted its usefulness to the insurer. 'ILFC's future rate of growth should be at least equal to AIG's,' he claims, 'which, we've said, should be 15 per cent or better.'</p>

			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / UK Company News: North of England BS falls 19% North of England Building Society yesterday announced a fall from Pounds 16.7m to Pounds 13.5m in pre-tax profits for the 1993 year. The decline was against the trend of recent announcements in the sector which have shown significantly increased profits. The 19 per cent fall, struck after an exceptional profit of Pounds 1m from the sale of its Sunderland headquarters, was due mainly to increased provisions, totalling Pounds 2.58m, for mortgage losses and the need to compensate customers of its independent financial advice service who suffered as a result of mis-selling. Gross mortgage advances fell to Pounds 168.4m (Pounds 288.5m). There were reductions in net interest receivable at Pounds 25.9m (Pounds 26.7m) and other income and charges at Pounds 6.9m (Pounds 7.37m). Total assets rose to Pounds 1.51bn (Pounds 1.42bn).</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Research supports the conclusion that more extensive education of health care providers and consumers in the medical and psychosocial aspects of disability and in the area of human sexuality and communications regarding this aspect of health care could lead to improved health services for women with disabilities. Among the problems in providing appropriate reproduction-related services to women with disabilities is the limited experience of obstetricians-gynecologists with health issues of various types of disabilities, and the limited involvement of physiatrists and other specialists in prenatal care. Physicians who may have been involved in the woman's previous care include a physiatrist, orthopedist, neurologist and urologist. The proposed project is to investigate appropriate roles for these specialists in the pregnancy care team. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If women with disabilities are to have options for reproductive care comparable to those available to women without disabilities, then the obstetrical profession and ancillary health care personnel must be educated on the special pregnancy-related needs of women with physical disabilities. Development and dissemination of current information to health care practitioners and to women with disabilities will be a key element of any project to be funded under this priority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Being informed is one of the best ways for a woman to increase her confidence and ensure she is given the same pregnancy-related options as her nondisabled peers. (Beckmann, Gittler, Barzansky, and Beckmann,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Obstetrics and Gynecology <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , Vol. 74, No. 1, July, 1989). A woman with a disability who is pregnant should be aware of major risks, and needs a support system that includes an obstetrical team sensitive to the specific issues related to her disability. (Freda, Cioschi, Nilson,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Physical Disabilities <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , AOTA, Vol. 12, No. 2, June 1989.) For this reason, the project to be supported under this priority must address the pregnancy-related information needs of women with physical disabilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Choices concerning pregnancy and motherhood often have different implications for women in diverse cultures, depending upon the psychosocial expectations of women and the support systems available to them. Expectations and support systems of disabled women from minority backgrounds may be quite different from those available to other women. A project to be funded under this priority is expected to address the research questions concerning disability, pregnancy, and cultural competency. Thus, any project must involve not only women with physical disabilities, but also disabled women from diverse cultural backgrounds, in the design, conduct, and dissemination of the research. A grantee funded under this priority is expected to demonstrate familiarity and ability to coordinate both research and dissemination with other projects and agencies addressing related issues, including the Department of Health and Human Services and its grantees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Priority <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An R&amp;D project on reproductive issues for women with disabilities shall_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Study the impact and risks of pregnancy and childbirth for women with various physical disabilities; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Identify the current gaps in research and the information needed by practitioners and consumers regarding the gynecologic and reproductive care of women with physical disabilities;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

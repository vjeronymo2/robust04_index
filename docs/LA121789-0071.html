			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MURDER IN A REMOTE NEIGHBORHOOD;  </P> <P> ASHES OF IZALCO BY CLARIBEL ALEGRIA AND DARWIN J. FLAKOLL TRANSLATED BY DARWIN  J. FLAKOLL (CURBSTONE PRESS: $17.95, CLOTH; 0-915306-83-2; $9.95, PAPER; 173  PP.; 0-915206-84-0)  </P> <P> Born in Nicaragua but reared in El Salvador, Claribel Alegria is the author of  the prose poem, "Luisa in Realityland," about the intrusion of war into the  life of the Salvadoran upper class, and the co-editor of the bilingual poetry  collection, "On the Front Line: Guerrilla Poems of El Salvador." If she is  something less than the poetess laureate of the FMLN rebels, her sympathies are  clear from her bibliography.  </P> <P> They would seem to be equally clear from the title of her latest work,  co-authored in 1966 with her husband, Darwin J. Flakoll, but only now released  in English. Izalco is a Salvadoran town near the Guatemala border, named for a  nearby volcano. It was there in 1932 that the most infamous mass murder of la  matanza, the decade-long Salvadoran slaughter of the 1930s, took place.  Hundreds of disarmed Indians, their thumbs bound together, were herded into the  central plaza to hear an address by Gen. Maximiliano Hernandez Martinez. But  the truck that was to have brought the general brought, instead, an army death  squad. The captives were machine-gunned to the last man and boy.  </P> <P> Against this background, the title, "Ashes of Izalco," would seem to announce a  phoenix, the guerrillas of yesterday arising as today's Frente Farabundo Marti  de Liberacion Nacional. The epigraph to the book, from Francisco de Quevedo,  only reinforces the initial impression. Translated, it reads:  </P> <P>  They will be dust,  </P> <P>  but the dust will have feeling.  </P> <P>  Ash, but the ash  </P> <P>  will be in love.  </P> <P> Quevedo was a satirist, however, and there is something inverted, if scarcely  satirical, about "Ashes of Izalco." Which is to say that, quite deliberately,  it does not keep its opening promise. Though it is set during the Salvadoran  civil war of the 1930s, and though all its characters know that a war is under  way, no major character ever speaks a line for either of the contending sides.  Neither the rebels nor those who are beating them back are granted much  personal or ideological space in its pages. Here are no Marxist guerrilla  voices, no North American imperialist voices, and only rarely, even in a  culturally conservative, upper-class setting, anything approaching a foursquare  authoritarian or militaristic voice.  </P> <P> The novella is, instead, a visit to Graham Greeneland in which the usual roles  of observer and observed have been exchanged. There are, in the Greene manner:  a dissolute American writer, fleeing his past; an earnest Seventh-Day-Adventist  missionary whom he knew as a boy and has sought out in his extremity; a hot,  dusty, isolated tropical town, its ancient upper class smug, its primeval lower  class numb; and one beautiful, restless woman, reading French novels and  yearning for someone to talk to, the wife of the chess-playing, patriarchal,  conventionally macho town physician. What makes the result decidedly  un-Greene-like is that the observing, interpreting, organizing intelligence is  local and often female rather than foreign and male.  </P> <P> The novella opens just after the death of Isabel, the doctor's wife. Carmen,  her daughter, having returned home for the funeral, has found, among her  mother's papers, the diary of Frank, the American writer, whom she remembers  only vaguely. What she learns from the diary is that Frank and her mother had a  brief, passionate affair -- they slept together just once -- and then parted.  To Frank, the Salvadoran beauty was a last chance at a new beginning. To  Isabel, the American was a beginning that could only entail a dozen cruel  endings. He had already cut all his ties. After her night with him, she  discovered the power of hers -- and chose them over him.  </P> <P> As Carmen's thoughts interrupt and interpret her reading of Frank's diary, the  novella becomes, for all its brevity, two kinds of story: the love story of  Isabel and Frank; and a middle passage for Carmen, who, married to a  passionless American and living in the United States, measures her distance  both from Santa Ana and from her husband by the depth of her mother's  unsuspected pain.  </P> <P> Why then the title and the epigraph? What has this intensely personal melodrama  to do with the ashes of Izalco?  </P> <P> The answer is not at all obvious, but what the book has to do with Izalco may  be what America has to do with El Salvador. The United States as a political  power is absent from this novella: No diplomat or soldier ever makes an  appearance. American culture, people and products, however, are omnipresent.  Virgil, the missionary, exhorts his peasants to reform their agriculture as  they reform their lives (he dies with them at Izalco). Frank implores Isabel to  abandon her life in Santa Ana and share his. A Santa Ana dowager, gossiping  about a recent wedding, notes approvingly that all the gifts were imported from  the United States. Finally, the narrator herself -- reading a stranger's diary  and discovering her own mother -- is married to an American and residing in  Washington, D.C. Like so many of her countrymen, she has made our country hers.  </P> <P> It is this cultural traffic, the novella hints, that has made it possible for  the ruling class of El Salvador to regard that country's civil war rather as  Beverly Hills might regard the drug wars of South Central Los Angeles; that is,  as trouble in a remote neighborhood. (El Salvador is no larger in area than Los  Angeles, Orange and San Diego Counties combined.) Mulholland Drive doesn't know  and isn't eager to learn what the LAPD or the FBI or the DEA is doing on Martin  Luther King Boulevard. Whatever it is, it's probably necessary. In "Ashes of  Izalco," the upper class of Santa Ana regards most of El Salvador just that  way. In innumerable ways, the United States is far more vividly present to the  upper-class mind (as Manhattan might be to Mulholland) than the local rebels  are.  </P> <P> The Izalco massacre, as described in Frank's penultimate letter to Isabel,  comes thus as a late and monstrous intrusion rather than a true climax. Frank  Wolff does not interpret the atrocity. Neither does Carmen Rojas as she reads  his diary, decades later. If the reader is invited to interpret it, the  invitation is severely muted.  </P> <P> Not least for that muting, "Ashes for Izalco" is an unsatisfying book. Isabel,  provocatively personal with Frank without departing from the propriety of her  station, is an intriguing character. Frank, whose debauched past is attributed  rather than evoked, is a good deal less intriguing; and unfortunately, Frank,  through his diary and letters, does most of the talking. For its brevity,  moreover, the novella is overcrowded with minor characters.  </P> <P> And yet it is often interesting and always alive. Farabundo Marti, an offstage  presence, is described as Augusto Sandino's secretary. Other details offered in  passing provide -- against the authors' transparent determination not to write  a conventional political novel -- background information on the long-running  civil war. More important, the central subject -- Isabel's refusal to escape  and Frank's ensuing despair (chronicled in his last letters to her) -- grows in  power when joined to the memory of the Izalco massacre. Alegria and Flakoll may  decline every opportunity to draw parallels. We are left wondering,  nonetheless, whether the ashes of Izalco are not of at least two kinds.  </P></p>

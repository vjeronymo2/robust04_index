			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / BNFL to make appeal BRITISH NUCLEAR Fuels is to appeal to Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, against refusal by the Lake District Special Planning Board to allow exploratory drilling in the Lake District national park in its search for space for a Pounds 2.5bn nuclear waste repository. The appeal on behalf of UK Nirex, the nuclear-waste consortium, follows a decision to refuse permission for a borehole several miles inland from the Sellafield nuclear-waste reprocessing site. The board rejected the proposals because of the harmful effect on the landscape and noise and disturbance.</p>

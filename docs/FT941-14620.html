			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Government Bonds: Gilts rally on signs of falling borrowing requirement UK government bonds rallied more than a point at the long end yesterday in response to the Bank of England's announcement that it will auction Pounds 2.75bn of 6 1/4 per cent Treasury stock due 2010 on January 26. The size of the auction was well below market expectations of between Pounds 3bn and Pounds 3.25bn, while the maturity and the coupon came as no surprise. Analysts interpreted the smaller amount of stock on offer as a sign that the funding requirement was falling, and that future auctions were more likely to raise in the region of Pounds 2.75bn to Pounds 3bn. In the past year, auctions have ranged from Pounds 3bn to Pounds 3.5bn. The Bank's decision to set the partly-paid element in March added weight to this view. The 8 3/4 per cent gilt due 2017 rose 1 1/16 point to 126 11/32 , while at the shorter end, the 6 per cent gilt due 1999 rose  11/32 point to 101 5/32 . The long gilt future rose  27/32 to 119.02. Although there was not a great deal of activity yesterday, analysts were optimistic that the recent buyers' strike was coming to an end. They said favourable news about inflation - the retail prices index for December is due to be published today - would also encourage buyers. The mood on other European government bond markets also improved yesterday after a shaky start to trading. Most showed gains in late trading. German government bonds rose  1/4 point, as the market awaited tomorrow's Bundesbank council meeting. Danish government bonds rose by as much as a  1/2 point from the day's lows following the Danish national bank's decision to cut the discount and key deposit rates to 5.75 per cent from 6 per cent. They ended the day around a  1/4 point higher. Analysts said that although the cut in interest rates had been widely expected, it still had a positive impact on bond prices because it underlined the favourable outlook for the Danish bond market. One analyst at a Danish bank in London noted that the yield differential between 10-year benchmark Danish and German government bonds now stood at less than 30 basis points. Analysts expect the differential to narrow further. Japanese government bonds and futures continued to weaken as the market remained gloomy about the government's intentions regarding its fiscal package. Worries about trade tensions between the US and Japan added to the market's woes, analysts said. The March contract broke below the technical support level of 115 in Tokyo, losing 1 1/4 points to 114.95, but rebounded to 115.15 in London trading. Liffe reported that its Japanese government bond futures contract set a new daily record of 6,565 contracts yesterday, beating its previous daily record of 5,574 contracts set last May. The No 157 benchmark Japanese government bond fell just under a  1/4 point to 105.53 in Tokyo, and continued to lose ground in London trading. US Government bonds made small gains at the longer end in light and largely directionless trading yesterday, as the market awaited fresh economic statistics later in the week. The benchmark 30-year Treasury issue ended the day at 99 13/16 , up 5/16 , to yield 6.259, while the 10-year issue was up  3/16 at 100 13/32 to yield 5.685. Volume was light at the market opened after Monday's Martin Luther King Day holiday and may also have been slowed by the Los Angeles earthquake. The day began with a soft tone and small initial losses, but then saw modest gains in afternoon trading, which dealers attributed partly to short covering. However, traders remained jittery about the economic outlook following a run of better-than-expected statistics late last week, which hit bond prices hard. The market was also concerned about today's announcement by the Treasury of details of its next auction of two- and five-year notes.</p>

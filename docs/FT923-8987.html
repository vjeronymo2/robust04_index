			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / UK Company News: BOC advance to Pounds 251m lifts share price by 17p BOC, the industrial gases and healthcare group, yesterday demonstrated its resilience by revealing a 10 per cent rise in pre-tax profits for the nine months to June 30 from Pounds 229m to Pounds 251m. Although the results were below expectations, which had ranged as high as Pounds 257m, BOC's shares rose 17p to 601p. Earnings per share rose 8 per cent from 30.49p to 33.06p. Mr Ian Clubb, finance director, warned that there was no clear indication of any improvement in economic conditions in its main world markets. He said the group would continue to reduce costs and improve operating efficiencies. Turnover increased from Pounds 2.07bn to Pounds 2.15bn. Gases and related products lifted operating profits from Pounds 207.5m to Pounds 217.4m. Requirements for compressed gases, used mainly in welding and cutting, remained poor. However, demand for liquid gases continued to grow, except in the US where the market was flat and in Japan where it was much lower, said Mr Clubb. Cost control measures had ensured that margins for those operations were up slightly at 14.5 per cent. The healthcare businesses' increased contribution of Pounds 76.5m (Pounds 68.3m) was, said Mr Clubb, aided by an improved performance at Glasrock, the home healthcare operation. Negotiations are under way to sell Glasrock to Homedco Group, a California-based company, for Dollars 72m (Pounds 37.6m). Mr Clubb admitted that third quarter results for the healthcare businesses had been below those of last year. He blamed poor demand for health devices and the weakness of the dollar. Most healthcare operations' sales were in the US. In addition, the group was spending about Pounds 8m a year on development costs at Delta Biotechnology, which the group acquired last November from Bass, the brewing company. Mr Clubb said BOC continued to enjoy very strong cash-flow. Gearing had fallen from 32 per cent to 30 per cent. Some of the group's debt has been transfered into dollars, which has depreciated against sterling, while also benefiting from lower interest rates. Mr Clubb pointed out that the interest rate differential between the dollar and sterling was seven percentage points. Overall debt had fallen by Pounds 100m since the start of the financial year, of which Pounds 40m had been thanks to a cut in working capital, he said. He warned that if present currency rates persisted, they would have an adverse impact on the translation of overseas results for the year. See Lex</p>

			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> NEPAL;  </P> <P> 18 REPORTED KILLED IN STREET FIGHTING  </P> <P> Chaotic street battles pitting supporters of Nepal's ousted hard-line regime  against police and bands of vigilantes left at least 18 people dead and  prompted orders for army troops to kill violators of an all-night curfew. Prime  Minister Krishna Prasad Bhattarai and King Birendra discussed the situation,  but their talks were inconclusive, government sources said. Pro-democracy  protests, in which at least 100 people were killed, brought a government of  liberals, Communists and human rights activists to office late last week.  </P></p>

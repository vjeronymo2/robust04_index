			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Lib Dems target the politically uncommitted A FRESH agenda in British politics addressing basic issues such as the creation of a 'society of opportunity' is the theme the Liberal Democrats hope will bring new people into politics. A consultation paper called Challenge, Opportunity and Responsibility was launched yesterday by Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, ready for discussion at the party conference next week. Both Mr Ashdown and Mr Charles Kennedy, party president, said the debate about the paper would be even more important than discussion of the party's future strategy. Potential involvement of the politically uncommitted is a critical element in Liberal Democrat efforts to move discussion away from the question of possible pacts or agreements with Labour. Mr Ashdown said the 'values' document showed that the party was confident enough to raise the difficult questions avoided by the other parties. It would form the basis for a framework paper to be considered at next year's party conference, and be the first step in mapping out the next general election manifesto. It says: 'The empowerment of the individual - every individual, not just those who are already richer and more successful - is our key aim.' Mr Ashdown conceded that it would be more difficult for the Liberal Democrats to involve the politically inactive when the party had been in existence for a few years, than it had been to bring people into the SDP as a fresh venture. He insisted, however, that the consultation paper marked the second part of a two-stage strategy: post-election dissatisfaction with the government's economic policy and only a limp challenge from Labour contributed to circumstances in which the third party could emerge as a stronger force. In the strategy debate, the party would be able to decide, Mr Ashdown said, whether its aim was still to build itself up to be a party of government - as he believed - or whether it should settle for a lesser role.</p>

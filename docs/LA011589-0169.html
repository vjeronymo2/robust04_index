			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> MOURNING IS MAKING HIS MARK -- QUICKLY  </P> <P> It's taken Georgetown freshman Alonzo Mourning only 12 games to set two school  records and conjure up comparisons to such stars as Patrick Ewing, Moses Malone  and David Robinson.  </P> <P> All the attention and acclaim is just grand, but Mourning would just as soon be  recognized for his own talents rather than be cited as the second-coming of  someone else.  </P> <P> "All these comparisons create a little extra pressure," he admitted. "But I  shouldn't let it get to me because I'm not Patrick Ewing or anyone else. I'm  Alonzo Mourning. What I have to do is work hard and play my game, work to reach  my goals and make a name for myself."  </P> <P> The 6-foot-10 center needed little time to make an impression on the opposition  and on the Georgetown record book. In his first home game, he registered the  school's first "triple-double" by scoring 11 points, snaring 10 rebounds and  blocking a Hoya-record 11 shots against St. Leo.  </P> <P> "There's no question that since Moses, he's the best big kid to come out of  high school," said Miami coach Bill Foster after Mourning burned the Hurricanes  for 26 points and 17 rebounds.  </P> <P> After watching Mourning score 15 points and block seven shots against his team,  Pitt coach Paul Evans, who coached Robinson at Navy, declared, "There's no  comparison. Robinson averaged six minutes a game as a freshman.  </P> <P> "I said last year that if I was owner of one of the seven teams in the NBA  lottery, I would have gotten Mourning out of high school," Evans added. "Two  years down the road, he's better than the kids that went in the lottery last  year."  </P> <P> Mourning is the first Hoya to wear No. 33 since Ewing left the school in 1984.  Georgetown guard Charles Smith, who played with Ewing, said Mourning has a good  chance to be just as dominating as the man whose number he now wears.  </P> <P> "He's improving every game because he's a hard worker in both practice and in  games," Smith said. "He's getting the same publicity as Patrick, and has a good  shot at being every bit as good."  </P> <P> Mourning is averaging 14.5 points, 8 rebounds and 6 blocked shots a game. He's  shooting 64 percent from the floor, but anguishes over every turnover and every  personal foul.  </P> <P> "I don't have that much experience, so I'm going to make mistakes and do a lot  of stupid things," he said. "It's all part of the learning experience."  </P> <P> Indeed, sometimes it's hard to remember that Mourning is only 18 years old and  just one year removed from playing high school ball in Chesapeake, Va. But his  coach, John Thompson, who invited him to the tryouts for the 1988 U.S. Olympic  team, hasn't lost sight of the fact.  </P> <P> "He makes some freshman mistakes, but I think it would be kind of weird if in  his freshman year he didn't," Thompson said. "I'm pleased, but I think we all  have to remember that with all of the accolades and comparisons that we go  through with Alonzo, he's still a freshman."  </P> <P> Thompson, who last summer invited Mourning to try out for the 1988 U.S. Olympic  team, said he is content to slowly bring him along.  </P> <P> "I don't want somebody to come in here at 18, 19 years old and become a  super-human being," Thompson said. "He's got to go through a maturation period,  so if he makes some mistakes it's a good thing, because it gives me a chance to  teach."  </P> <P> Even though Mourning didn't get to go to Seoul for the Olympics, he said the  experience as the first high school player to participate in tryouts was a  worthwhile one in preparing him for playing in the college ranks.  </P> <P> "Trying out for the Olympics and playing against all that talent really molded  me to the point where I was ready," he said. "I was comfortable in the college  atmosphere I was in, so I really didn't have to all of sudden adjust to it.  Just by playing against that talent, I learned."  </P> <P> If there's anything that separates Mourning from Ewing, Malone et al, it's his  propensity to attempt -- and make -- long outside jump shots. He's clicked on  his only three-point attempt, and swished a 17-footer in the Hoyas' 76-57 rout  of Pitt last Wednesday.  </P> <P> Thompson kiddingly claimed that Mourning's long-range talent could cost him  money in the future.  </P> <P> "Alonzo's a good outside shooter and that's the worst thing that can happen,"  Thompson said. "Sometimes a big guy is a good outside shooter and then he heads  out there and starts to play well. Everytime he does that, I tell him, 'When  you go into the NBA, that's going to take $3 million off your salary because  guards don't get paid as much as centers.'  </P> <P> "He's a center," Thompson deadpanned. "I've told him from the day I met him, in  the NBA they play from the inside out. There are only about five centers  available, and if you go out and play guard like 100,000 other people, that's  foolish. But I think he can hit those outside shots."  </P></p>

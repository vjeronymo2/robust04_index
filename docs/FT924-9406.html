			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Environmental costs 'may bankrupt some oil refiners' TIGHTER environmental legislation on oil refiners could mean higher prices for consumers and bankruptcies among refineries, delegates heard yesterday on the second day of the Financial Times Petroleum and Gas conference. Several speakers warned the costs to refiners of green regulations would be tens of billions of dollars which oil companies could ill afford. Mr Klaus Kohlhase, head of health, safety and environment at BP and chairman of Concawe, the European oil industry's environmental organisation, warned that the total cost of all potential environmental laws was Dollars 70bn to Dollars 80bn, or about Dollars 10bn a year to the end of the decade. 'To put this in perspective, Dollars 10bn was the total for 1991 of profits from worldwide operations for the 10 largest European oil companies. The industry just cannot afford this investment level,' he said. Of environmental controls already implemented or being seriously considered by the European Community, Mr Kohlhase said reducing emissions of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides was likely to cost Dollars 1bn; controlling hydrocarbon evaporation losses during storage and transfer, Dollars 2bn; controlling hydrocarbon evaporation during refilling of cars at service stations, Dollars 1bn; reducing the sulphur content of diesel fuel to 0.05 per cent, Dollars 4bn to Dollars 5bn; and reducing sulphur in heating fuel to 0.1 per cent, Dollars 2bn. Mr Kohlhase warned that in a competitive environment, there was limited scope for passing on these costs to the consumer, and that refineries might start going out of business, as was already happening in the US. Mr Maurice Allion, of the European Commission's directorate-general for energy, and Mr Yves Nanot, president of refining and distribution at Total, the French oil company, both agreed the refining industry faces potential spending of upwards of Dollars 60bn. Mr Allion said oil companies' cash flow would not be sufficient and outside financing would have to be sought. 'If I was cynical, I would say the consumer at the end of the day will pay,' he added. Mr Nanot warned that oil companies could not deliberately engage in activities that harmed the development of the industry, which had made a significant contribution to improving the quality of life. He urged closer co-operation between the oil and car manufacturing industries in finding environmental solutions, and between the oil industry and the European Commission. He added that all emissions control proposals should undergo rigorous cost-benefit analysis and be based on strong scientific evidence. Inefficient constraints, he warned, would have a negative impact on the refining business, with important consequences for sustainable development in Europe. Mr Pieter Koppenol, senior managing director of Comprimo, the Dutch engineering company, said environmental proposals presented huge opportunities for companies specialising in pollution control processes and systems. He emphasised the need to strike a balance between the environmental benefits and energy consumption of pollution control, warning that generating the energy required to remove one tonne of sulphur from the diesel stream in a refinery emitted 20 tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.</p>

			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / International Company News: Jitters on the Japanese stock market - Investors fear the Nikkei index may drop even further When the Nikkei index slid below 19,000 to a nine-month low yesterday, there were renewed fears that further weakness in the Tokyo stock market would harm the fragile recovery in Japan's ecomony currently being revealed by companies' interim earnings. The immediate cause of the decline has been the recent sharp fall in Wall Street and Sony's announcement last week that it was writing Y265bn (Dollars 2.7bn) off the value of its US movie subsidiary. The consumer electronics company's share price has fallen by 11.7 per cent in the past three days, dragging down the whole market. There have also been lingering fears over the health of the country's banks. Worries about the stability of Japan's financial system hit the stock market this time last year following the banks' poor half-year results, and some investors, expecting another set of poor results, are taking profits ahead of the banks' earnings announcements over the next two days. The market's current decline started back in June when the Nikkei index stood at around 21,000 and when overseas fund managers, who had been aggressive buyers early in the year, called a halt. Many of the overseas investors had initially hoped that aggressive deregulation of many Japanese industries, rigorous restructuring by some companies, and hopes of an easing of short-term interest rates by the Bank of Japan, would boost the economy and lead to a general rise in share prices. But, says Mr Alex Kinmont, a strategist at Morgan Stanley in Tokyo, 'these reasons for owning stocks did not materialise'. Domestic institutional investors have been constrained from sharply increasing their share holdings. Banks, which need to offset their losses on bad loan write-offs, have been selling their long-term holdings. Retail investors have been virtually absent from the stock market since the Nikkei average started its tumble in 1990, soon after reaching an all-time high of nearly 39,000 in December 1989. Although some analysts have hoped that a rally led by retail investors similar to that of the UK and US a few years ago would pluck the stock market from its current slump, the small private investors have, in fact, looked for safety with bank deposits. Some analysts believe that share prices will not rebound without a 'selling climax', allowing prices to fall to a point where investors regard the shares as fair value; others, however, are worried that further selling could push the market into free-fall.

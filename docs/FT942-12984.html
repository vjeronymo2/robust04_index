			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / The Lex Column: BAT's tobacco habit At first sight it might seem surprising that BAT Industries is investing Dollars 1bn in US tobacco rather than putting its money, literally, in a building society. Yet the acquisition of American Tobacco does not preclude a move in financial services. Gearing of around 50 per cent by the year-end looks perfectly comfortable, given BAT's ability to generate cash. Having made the decision to stay in US tobacco, BAT badly needed to strengthen its hand. Even after the acquisition, BAT will be fighting from third place behind Philip Morris and RJR Nabisco. But raising its market share to around 18 per cent should bring greater clout. If promised efficiencies in manufacturing and sales are delivered, BAT will also have scope to widen its margins. That would leave it better placed to weather a price war if the market leaders decide to absorb some of the US government's proposed tobacco tax. Despite such commercial logic, though, one might still question the decision to make a strategic investment in a declining market. Faced with similar arguments, American Brands decided to get out. There are certainly risks. The steady decline in US cigarette sales could easily accelerate, while the one-off impact of the tobacco tax can only be guessed at. BAT's gamble is that an exit multiple of around nine times last year's earnings is cheap enough to compensate. Since the big US tobacco companies are bundled within larger groups, that valuation is difficult to test. But if the additional investment delivers a return in all but the most trying market conditions, the group as a whole must be less risky as a result.</p>

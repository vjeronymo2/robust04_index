			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / Government Bonds: Supply fears push European prices to new lows Bears continued to ravage the market yesterday, pushing government bond prices in several European markets to new lows for this year in volatile trading. The overnight fall in US Treasuries got European bonds off to a weak start. Moreover, supply fears continue to overhang the markets, where sellers and issuers continue to outnumber buyers. 'At the moment it is all about supply,' says Mr Kirit Shah, international bond strategist at First Chicago. 'Supply from bulls who didn't sell earlier on, supply from governments and now from emerging economies and corporates into the economic recovery.' Although he says bonds are in for a correction, he expects supply pressures to cap the upside. 'We could have a bounce, but don't expect any firework rallies,' he warned. UK gilts fell sharply at the open, pressured by weakness in the US. The short end of the yield curve came under further pressure from Wednesday's statements by Bank of England governor Mr Eddie George, which were seen to prepare the ground for a pre-emptive interest-rate increase. The long end of the yield curve outperformed the short end on hopes that tight monetary policy would curb future inflation, but weakened on the day. The 8 3/4 per cent gilt due 2017 fell by  27/32 to 102 1/4 . This dampened expectations that the Bank of England today will announce an ultra-long-dated gilt auction, a hope which has buzzed around the market in recent days. 'Today's sell-off makes it less likely they'll fund at the long end,' said Mr Ifty Islam, fixed income strategist at Merrill Lynch, who says another floating-rate issue is possible. German bunds fell to a new low in the futures market, but recouped most of the losses in late short-covering to end only slightly lower. However, the mood remains fragile and dealers expect further volatility. French bonds fell sharply, causing the 10-year French yield spread over German bonds to jump to 53 basis points, from 43 basis points on Wednesday. The Bank of France's latest 10 basis point cut in its intervention rate to 5.2 per cent lent little support, having been widely expected. Meanwhile, although the Treasury's latest auction of two and five-year notes went relatively smoothly, much of it was seen to have ended on traders' books. Southern European markets were again badly hit by budget worries in Italy, political jitters in Spain and a Portuguese bond auction where the average yield soared by 125 basis points from the previous auction in late May. The US Treasury bond market, focusing on a weaker tone in commodities, rebounded yesterday despite mostly unfavourable economic news. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  1/4 ahead at 86 5/16 , with the yield slipping to 7.365 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was  1/16 better at 100 1/8 , to yield 5.787 per cent. With the market reeling from a sharp rise in the price of crude oil and other commodities the previous afternoon, traders were greeted yesterday morning by fresh signs of economic acceleration. The Commerce Department reported that housing starts last month had risen 2.6 per cent, a big surprise for a market expecting a 0.8 per cent decline. The data suggested the recent tightening of monetary policy has so far failed to constrain the rate-sensitive construction industry. The impression of robust growth was reinforced by the weekly report on initial claims for unemployment benefit, which provides the most up to date snapshot of the economy's overall health. Yesterday, it showed 11,000 fewer people had made claims last week than during the previous seven days. While the two reports were not especially important by themselves, they did nothing to dispel the sense of confusion reigning in the debt markets. Recent data, taken as a whole, has not painted a convincing picture, either favourable or unfavourable, to lead bonds out of their current trading range. The same was true of the monthly survey of business conditions issued by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia later in the morning. But the mixed signals it conveyed were at least enough to trigger a reversal in the market's decline, especially with analysts looking for even stronger numbers out of Philadelphia. By early afternoon, bonds had retraced all of their earlier losses and moved into positive territory as commodity prices began to drift lower on the heels of Wednesday's sharp rise.</p>

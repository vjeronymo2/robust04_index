			<p>BFN     [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 1/6/1994 -- The ninth round of  the Moldovan-Russian negotiations concerning the status and  terms of withdrawal of the 14th Russian Army from Moldovan  territory will be held on 7 and 8 June in Moscow, stated to BASA  Ion Nastac, head of the press secretariat of the Ministry of  Defence. The official Moldovan delegation will be headed by  Nicolae Osmochescu, vice-minister of foreign affairs, specified  the cited source. Colonel Nicolae Tudureanu will lead the group  of military experts. With the approval of both Moldovan and  Russian delegations, representatives of Tiraspol will be allowed  to attend the negotiations. The previous round of talks was  held in March 1994 in Chisinau. The negotiators did not agree  on the terms of withdrawal of the Russian armed forces from  Moldova, for the Russian delegation wanted Moldova to grant  Dniester a spectral juridical status in conjunction with its  withdrawal. At this meeting the Moldovan delegation was headed  by Anatol Taran, former ambassador of Moldova to Moscow.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The commanders of the IDF's [Israel Defense Forces]  Central and Southern Commands today signed an order empowering  them to define any group employing violence and threats as a  terrorist organization. This expands the authority of the two  major generals responsible for the areas where most of the Kakh  and Kahana Hay members reside.    Up until now, the Antiterror Act could only be enforced  inside the Green Line and had no legal validity in the  territories. If the IDF commanders make use of their new  powers, it will be possible to take measures against those  organizations that are defined as terrorist in nature, their  members, and their property, with all the attendant  ramifications.</p>

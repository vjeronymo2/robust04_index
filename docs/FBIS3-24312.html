			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Volodymyr Pylypchuk, chairman of the </F> Parliamentary Commission on Economic Reform, and Pavlo Minenko,  department chairman at the Lviv Trade and Economic Institute, by  Volodymyr Oliynyk; place and date not given: "`With a Normal  Government Ukraine Can Very Soon Become One of the Ten Most  Developed Countries in the World'"-- first paragraph is editor's  subhead identifying source of quoted statement]    [Text] -- believes Volodymyr Pylypchuk, chairman of  the Parliamentary Commission on Economic Reform, who recently  returned from the U.S., where he led a delegation of 29  Ukrainian economists belonging to the so-called shadow cabinet.  Apropos of this, a conversation with Volodymyr Pylypchuk and  Pavlo Minenko, department chairman at the Lviv Trade and  Economic Institute, who was a member of the delegation.    [Oliynyk] What was the purpose of the Ukrainian delegation's  visit to Colorado?    [Pylypchuk] Our first objective was to study the management  system at the level of an American state and to learn what  powers and rights the states have as compared to our oblasts.  Which questions are decided at the government level. On which  matters cooperation is necessary. In other words, the issue that  has always been and still is the subject of dispute here in  Ukraine -- namely, the "division of powers."    Our second objective was to complete drafting a program for  ending the crisis in Ukraine, a program of economic reforms. In  addition, we had a third objective -- to eliminate any  theoretical differences among the members of our team. It was  our goal that when our team returned, we would not only have a  program of extraordinary measures for ending the crisis, a  program of market reforms, but also that all the members of our  team would be of the same opinion and agree on a single approach  to solving all issues. That this shadow cabinet, as it has been  called, should virtually become a single organism.    What is the situation in Yu. Zvyahilskyy's government? Ask  one minister how to solve a problem and you get one answer. Ask  a second minister, and you hear the opposite. Ask a third, and  you get something else again. In other words, there is no one  concept in the cabinet regarding what to do, how to do it, and  what steps to take to conduct reforms? This is what we wanted to  avoid.    [Oliynyk] Was it necessary to go to America to achieve this?  And why there? Was it because you received an invitation from  the U.S.?    [Pylypchuk] No. Our team, made up of the same people, also  has the opportunity to visit Germany and Greece, but the  American invitation was the first to arrive. Also, all the  arrangements for meetings and instructors had already been made  in the United States. Do not forget that we are on the  threshhold of elections, and many members of our team are  running for the office of people's deputy. Thus, the U.S. visit  was our optimum option. Moreover, the United States is a  traditionally capitalist country with a better defined classical  variant of capitalism.    [Oliynyk] Mr. Minenko, as a member of Pylypchuk's team, what  did you learn from this trip?    [Minenko] The two weeks we spent in Colorado were hard work,  because the esteemed Mr. Pylypchuk never "got off our backs," as  they say. We worked 16 hours a day. If my ideas differed  somewhat, they managed to persuade me to subscribe fully to the  program for ending the crisis.    [Oliynyk] What kind of work did you do in the United States?    [Pylypchuk] First, we listened to lectures and attended  seminars conducted by lecturers and representatives of various  state ministries and departments. In addition, every day after  supper, we held our own four-hour seminars, at which we polished  our program.    [Oliynyk] In other words, you have your own program for  ending the crisis. And if you head the future cabinet, you will  not vacillate. Incidentally, why does the government of Ukraine  ... make such poorly thought out moves?    [Pylypchuk] They are not a team. The government is not  equipped with reformist skills. Each minister is a very good  economist at the enterprise level, at the microeconomic level. I  studied the biographies of these people -- they were all  wonderful directors. But the economy of an enterprise consists  of production deliveries, sales, production costs,  profitability, prices, wages, etc. And they apply this kind of  economy at the state level, which is a fundamental mistake.  Because at the state level, the economy is managed with  interest, deposit, credit, currency, exchange rate, customs, and  budget policies. A policy of subventions, preferences,  regulation of liquidity, a reserve policy. These are completely  different levers, a different sphere of action, entailing a  different understanding of economics.    [Oliynyk] While your were visiting the United States,  strange  things were happening in Ukraine. The Cabinet of Ministers  consulted with the Union of Entrepreneurs, which is now headed  by former Prime Minister Kuchma. It brought to mind an analogy:  if one views the Cabinet of Ministers as a club of grand  masters, what is its level of expertise if it invites as its  consultants novice directors, including a wash-out grand master  like Kuchma? What is most objectionable about this is that it is  presented as an attempt to begin structural reform...    [Pylypchuk] The problem is that Yu. Zvyahilskyy's government  has no strategy. Every politician knows that you begin by  constructing the backbone (strategy) of a policy in order to  know where you are heading. Then you work out your tactics, the  steps you need to take and the order in which you have to take  them. You do all this without explaining anything to the  directors. Only in extraordinary circumstances, when  superincomprehensible situations arise, does the prime minister,  the deputy prime minister, or a minister come forth with an  explanation. This is when it is necessary to address the people  and say something like: "For the next three months, I will be  performing surgery on the economy to make it sound again. I  therefore ask you to tighten you belts and not complain." The  people will then understand what is going on. Right?! Whereas,  if the government continually misleads the people and does not  itself see the light at the end of the tunnel, then whatever it  does, whether it consults with novices or explains to elders --  it is all to no purpose. Clearly, these are death throes. It is  pity that the economy has been allowed to deteriorate to this  state. At the same time, this is a characteristic feature of the  political situation in Ukraine. We know that the communist  majority in parliament gave the government its best people -- I  say this without irony -- people it had groomed to govern. But  this merely serves as additional proof of what communists are  good for.    [Oliynyk] How was your delegation received in the United  States? As representatives of a poor, third-rate state, or as  partners who are simply experiencing problems at this time?    [Minenko] We were received at a very high level. We had  meetings and discussions at the level of the U.S. Ministry of  Finance [Department of Treasury], the World Bank, and the  International Monetary Fund. It was clear to us that we were  treated as representatives of a state; moreover, we were  constantly asked if Mr. Pylypchuk had really brought a team of  economists with him? At the beginning, when we worked in  Colorado, we spent only the first few days listening attentively  to our professors. After a few days, we had to say to them:  "Thank you, but we already know this." Later, the vice president  of this economic institute acknowledged that the Americans who  had met earlier with similar teams of economists from Armenia  and Russia were impressed by the high professional level of our  economists, because the level of instruction that we found  uninteresting had been quite satisfactory to them.    Many government institutions in the United States have  created departments that deal only with Ukraine. But apart from  the people who work directly with Ukraine, very few people in  America know anything about our country. A notion that is still  popular there, and this was confirmed even by diplomats, is that  Americans approach Ukraine as a piece of the former empire. In  other words, this is country located somewhere over there, in  Central Europe, it has a population of 52 million people and  nuclear missiles aimed at the U.S., and it refuses to disarm.  This perception of Ukraine is automatically passed on to most  officials. We also learned that these perceptions of Ukraine are  actively promoted by the representatives of our "older brother,"  of whom there are a total of 500 in the Russian embassy. They  have time to attend all the receptions and events. This makes it  difficult to counter [such perceptions].    [Oliynyk] You have brought us to the second part of this  question -- the political implication of the visit of the shadow  cabinet to the United States.    [Pylypchuk] A change is taking place in the perception of  Ukraine, of Ukrainians, their leaders, and their specialists.  The same "older brother" is spreading disinformation that  Ukraine allegedly lacks experts. This gave us all the more  satisfaction to surprise the Americans, who saw after meeting  with us that Ukraine does have experts, and high-class ones at  that. And that there exists a program for ending the crisis. To  which there are no objections on the part of the International  Monetary Fund, or the U.S. Ministry of Finance, or the World  Bank, or the U.S. Federal Reserve System. And so the Americans  wonder: why then are no reforms being effected in your country?  We have the necessary people and a program they support, which  their own experts would sign on to.    [Oliynyk] I would also like to ask this question. How did  you  explain this to them?    [Pylypchuk] You are not the first to ask me to explain. I  told them that there are many reformers in Ukraine but that they  are not part of the ruling Olympus. The opposition can propose  many things, but it is not able to implement its proposals.  Because it has no power. I believe that a radical change  occurred in American perceptions, and they came to understand  that Ukraine has the necessary forces, people, intellect, and  professional qualifications. There are also worked-out programs,  which are not in an embryonic stage, but which outline  specifically what needs to be done and how. This is another  political aspect of our visit. I would rather not go on about  the future government. All this will be possible if a parliament  of reformers comes to power and our collective wisdom is put to  use. If this does not happen, then all of us who made this trip  will at least have improved our professional skills. If the  procommunist parliament returns to power, our program, like all  earlier programs, will lie around gathering dust.    [Minenko] I would like to note another aspect as well. I  have  in mind the large reserves of which Ukraine makes little use.  Although our embassy is small, we have a powerful diaspora of  Ukrainian descent -- people like Mr. Yurko Chopivskyy and Mr.  Bohdan Futey and dozens of others, who helped us without any  gain for themselves and literally gave us a shoulder to lean on  to enable us to do more for Ukraine. They are very anxious to  see Ukraine draw closer to America.    [Oliynyk] Your team spent a week in Washington. How did  things go there?    [Pylypchuk] In Washington, we changed our method of working.  All our experts worked in groups according to their  specialization. I had my own program, which was closely linked  with obtaining technical assistance for Ukraine. We agreed on 70  million dollars in technical assistance to help speed up  privatization in Ukraine and 20 million dollars to enable us to  create a unified computer network in Ukraine that would make  corruption in privatization impossible. Our delegation met with  the U.S. Vice-President Gore's representatives, Mr. Marshall,  and his advisors.    [Oliynyk] Do you think that the present government will try  to take advantage of the results of your trip, that is, your  program?    [Pylypchuk] We are prepared to help the government if it is  interested. We are not planning to keep our program locked away  in a drawer. Except the plan for introducing a Ukrainian  currency -- we will never give Zvyahilskyy's government our  methodology for this. Not until we ourselves take over...  Because they will ruin the method for introducing the hryvnya as  they did the introduction of the coupon, and once again blame me  for everything. Like they did when they claimed that I had  promised that a kilogram of lemons would cost one coupon. I  burned my fingers on that one. They did not use my method for  introducing the coupon and then accused me of every sin in the  book. Nevertheless, we are prepared to advise even this  government. Because our objective is greater: to lead the  economy out of its present crisis, and that is why it does not  matter to us who accomplishes this -- this government or the  next.    [Oliynyk] What will happen in the economy until the  elections  are held? What do you predict?    [Pylypchuk] I have no wish to alarm people by painting  everything in black tones, but the economy will continue to  function at a primitive level.    [Oliynyk] Could you tell us the professional composition of  the group that accompanied you to the United States and which is  made up of people you count on. For ethical reasons it would be  inopportune to give us their names, even though it is generally  known that the group included Professor Chernyak and others.    [Pylypchuk] If we were to speak of the cabinet in broader  terms -- I have in mind the provisional future cabinet -- this  team is much larger: it consists of more than 200 people. There  is a humanitarian bloc, a power bloc, and an economic block,  which, incidentally, is made up of 60 people, only half of whom  visited the U.S. This group includes people who are working for  the present Cabinet of Ministers, people who are involved in  reforms, as well as people from the executive branch. I think  that should suffice.    This was my sixth visit to the United States, and each time  during my first days there I have been overcome by despair...  There are poor people in America; they make up 15 percent of the  population. This time I came back with a video cassette  portraying a "poor" American. What kind of living standard does  this poor person have? This "pauper" has a three-storied house  with eight rooms, albeit narrow in width. No one has such a  cottage in Ukraine. I do not have one, nor do any of the  moneybags who are today scaling the Olympus of power in our  country. Let alone the furniture in these buildings -- our  underground millionaires would be lucky to have such furniture  here. But by American standards, this is poverty. Our society's  living standard has yet to reach the level at which it could be  regarded as impoverished by American standards. At the same  time, I would like to say something else: at present, Ukraine is  a diamond that has not yet been polished and is lying in the  dust so that many think it to be plain glass. All that this  Ukrainian diamond needs is to be polished a tiny bit and put  into a dependable setting, and it will sparkle with many  brilliant colors. To those who have already buried Ukraine, I  would like to say: do not be in such a hurry. Ukraine is capable  of very quickly becoming one of the top ten most developed  countries in the world, including in terms of its living  standard. Ukraine is poor because this parliament and this  government are in power. This is her problem, but it is not her  fault. That is why we now face the supertask of electing a  normal parliament, which will form a normal government and a  normal bank that will enable us to rise to the level warranted  by our potential capabilities.</p>

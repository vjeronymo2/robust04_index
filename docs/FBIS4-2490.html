			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Hong Xia: "Beijing Targets 10 Percent </F> GDP Growth This Year"]    [Text] Beijing plans to push its economic output to 99  billion yuan ($11 billion) this year, a 10 percent jump over  1993.    The goal, set by Mayor Li Qiyan yesterday, is 2 percent less  than last year but 1 point higher than the national gross  domestic product (GDP) target of 9 percent for 1994.    The mayor opened the Municipal People's Congress [MPC], the  city legislature, by outlining several of the capital's economic  priorities for the coming year. The MPC session runs for one  week.    Li said agriculture and industry should grow 3.5 and 9.8  percent respectively.    He stressed the importance of the city's service sector -- a  development priority -- and projected an 11.5 percent increase  in output, making up 47.5 percent of GDP.    To ensure sustained, rapid and healthy growth, Beijing will  focus on improving economic efficiency and product quality.    It plans to spend 484 million yuan ($55.6 million) this year  to promote agriculture, 11.8 percent more than last year, Li  said.    Arable land should be preserved and more bases of non-staple  food set up. Vegetable farms will be expanded by 10,000  hectares.    Top finance official Sun Jiaqi shrugged off the city's $500  million deficit for 1994. Sun said revenue will grow by 9  percent to reach 4.25 billion yuan ($488 million). And  expenditures will reach 8.56 billion yuan ($984 million), up 5.7  percent over last year, the Finance Bureau director said.    But a roughly balanced budget is expected because of central  government tax refunds and subsidies, as well as last year's  financial surplus.    To increase farm income, the city will promote a high-yield,  quality and efficient agriculture.    Meanwhile, Beijing will encourage industry development that  consumes less water and energy and produces less pollution, Li  said.    The capital's three key industries of cars, electronics and  new building materials will be accelerated.    And technical renovation of enterprises will be stepped up,  he said, calling for one-third of the key plants to be revamped.    Retail sales are expected to increase 20 percent to hit 66.4  billion yuan ($7.6 billion) -- just the beginning of the city's  shopping bonanza.    Ten more shopping complexes with a floor space of at least  1O,OOO square metres will open to business in 1994.</p>

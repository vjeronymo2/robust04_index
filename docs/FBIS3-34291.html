			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres says he fears a  slowdown in the peace talks. Peres yesterday answered questions  about the negotiations with the Palestinians and the whole peace  process in a lively session in New York with members of the  Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations.  On the phone with details is Judy Lessing in New York:    [Begin recording] [Lessing] Shim'on Peres said his talks  with Yasir 'Arafat are negotiations between two people with deep  feelings and great emotions. With every point representing  thorns and miles of feelings, suspicions, and fears. He said  great care is taken over every word and nuance. There is a  drawback to this.    [Peres] We feel that if we shall go on at the present pace  we may lose a great deal of goodwill, both at home and abroad.  The tremendous amount of goodwill which exists today in the  world may evaporate and nothing will remain.    [Lessing] The foreign minister said recent remarks by Mr.  'Arafat to the United Nations Human Rights Commission that Arabs  do not believe Israel is serious about implementing the peace  accords do not surprise him.    [Peres] Let us not forget that we are arguing with 'Arafat,  not only agreeing. I do not expect 'Arafat to offer us  compliments. He wants to win points too.    [Lessing] Mr. Peres turned aside rumors that he and the  prime minister have differences and said that during the  negotiations they are in daily phone contact.    [Peres] Each of us is entitled to emphasis what he thinks is  important, but at the end of the day we reach an agreement  otherwise we could not work. Let me say very seriously that I  believe that Mr. Rabin, as myself, do understand in depth that a  divided leadership may be a catastrophe for peace and for the  country. You must trust us that we understand seriously what is  our responsibility, and do not pay so much understand to the  gossips and rumors.    [Lessing] Foreign Minister Peres said after President  Clinton and Syria's President al-Asad met, there was a new  climate.    [Peres] But when you look at the hard facts not many changes  really occurred. First of all, I wish that al-Asad would use  the same language like Clinton. It would warm up the heart of  many Israelis. But whereas Clinton was forthcoming and  generous, al-Asad was economic and careful.    [Lessing] Mr. Peres said he sees no change in four areas:  the negotiations with Syria lack openness, are too formal, and  do not give the negotiators the freedom to make mistakes and  work through them. President al-Asad is silent about peace.  Syria has an ambiguous position about security and Israel will  not buy equal footing, exchanging a demilitarized Golan for a  demilitarized Israel. There are no dramatic moves on Lebanon,  just slow caution.    [Peres] We on our side, we say that we are for a  comprehensive peace, Syria included, but we are against a  comprehensive negotiation. Because if we shall have to  negotiate simultaneously with all sides, the party which is slow  or reluctant may decide the pace of the negotiations. This is  more or less the situation.    [Lessing] Mr. Peres showed he is tired of the Saudi Arabian  position: a private backing of peace but nothing in public.    [Peres] The time has come for them, in my judgment, to stand  up and say clear things about peace. And, if you ask me, I am  totally dissatisfied with their position.    [Lessing] Mr. Peres said much has changed since Yig'al  Alon's red lines which could not be crossed. He said missiles  and nonconventional arms have changed the nature of security and  what is needed is a regional defense which is up to date and for  tomorrow, not for yesterday. [end recording]    Foreign Minister Peres also predicts that when peace is  achieved, an industrial zone will be created along the Jordan  River. He told the Jewish leaders in New York that the river  would be a bridge for new enterprises instead of a knife cutting  the economic flesh of Israel and Jordan.</p>

			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Dorrell acts over dramatic freebies Mr Stephen Dorrell, the national heritage minister, has imposed strict new limits on his officials' acceptance of free tickets to the opera, theatre and cinema. Whitehall insiders say the minister's ruling has fallen particularly hard on the most senior mandarins. They are accustomed to being courted for funds by the department's clients in the agreeable surroundings of Glyndebourne or the National Theatre. But Mr Dorrell, who told his officials some weeks ago that he wanted a stricter regime, decided that the freebies were inconsistent with an arm's-length relationship with the lobbyists. His instruction coincided with the recent furore over political sleaze. It followed a separate instruction earlier this year from Sir Robin Butler, the cabinet secretary, banning civil servants from collecting 'air miles' while travelling on official business. The heritage department stressed yesterday that Mr Dorrell had not imposed a blanket ban. Officials would still be permitted to accept free tickets if their attendance at a particular event was directly relevant to a project. But Mr Dorrell expects many more empty seats in London's royal boxes.</p>

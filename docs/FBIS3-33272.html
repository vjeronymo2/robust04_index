			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] National Resources Minister Luis Alvarado announced  that a biogenetic laboratory to study the lenga magallanica tree  will be built in Tierra del Fuego Province.    This initiative falls within the framework of an agreement  signed by the National Resources Ministry, Canadian Cooperation,  and a private foundation interested in studying why this specie  grows in an unfavorable environment.    The reason for this initiative is the intensive exploitation  of this resource by wood mills that use the lenga tree to  produce chips [preceding word in English].    [Begin recording] [Alvarado] The idea is to carry out a  scientific investigation that will tell us why this specie grows  in such an unfavorable environment. What we want to do is build  two sites on which this laboratory will be located.    [Unidentified reporter] Does this require a law?    [Alvarado] No. There is a direct agreement between the  National Resources Ministry, Canadian Cooperation, and a private  foundation. We estimate the research will take four to five  years before the lenga tree can be grown in nurseries. [end  recording]    If this initiative proves fruitful, Chile will be able to  grow lenga forests and thus have a new resource to exploit,  according to Alvarado, who is visiting the 12th Region.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Summary] Local government in Maritime Kray has stopped  making payments earmarked for revival of the raw minerals  industry into the federal budget. This will enable geological  prospecting and mining enterprises to retain tens of millions of  rubles that they can use to revive the local minerals industry  and to help alleviate social difficulties for the work forces of  the Solnechnyy mining and enrichment combine, the Uralskoye mine  administration, and a number of prospecting cooperatives. The  Amur gold mining cooperative has already, with the consent of  the tax inspectorate, put funds into stabilizing the financial  position of the Ayano-Mayskiy mining and geology enterprise.    Reductions in funding from the federal budget have halted  all  prospecting work and all growth in exploitation of known natural  resources in the kray. Extra funds promised by the Russian  Federation Government to stabilize the industry have not been  allocated this year.</p>

			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> USAIR PROBE TURNS TO MECHANICAL FAILURE;  </P> <P> INVESTIGATORS EXAMINE PIECES OF JET THAT CRASHED AT LA GUARDIA  </P> <P> An investigation into the crash of USAir Flight 5050 focused Saturday on the  possibility of mechanical failure, although officials said the rookie co-pilot  had punched the wrong cockpit button just before the craft plunged into the  East River.  </P> <P> Investigators continued removing pieces of the plane's fuselage from the water  off a runway at La Guardia Airport, National Transportation Safety Board  spokesman Ted Lopatkiewicz said. The parts will be examined to determine if  there were any mechanical problems in addition to the reported pilot error, he  said.  </P> <P> Speaking of the co-pilot's mistake, Lopatkiewicz said: "It may turn out that  was unrelated to what happened."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Strongly Criticized  </P> <P> The flight's pilot and co-pilot had their flight licenses suspended for leaving  the accident scene and were strongly criticized Friday by federal officials for  failing to immediately submit to drug and alcohol testing.  </P> <P> "At a time when drug abuse has become a major national problem, we believe the  American public has a right to know that its transportation system is alcohol  and drug free," said acting NTSB Chairman James Kolstad.  </P> <P> "The failure to promptly volunteer for alcohol and drug testing following a  major accident is inexcusable," he said, echoing an angry statement by Federal  Aviation Administration head James B. Busey.  </P> <P> The Air Line Pilots Assn., the union that issued a statement defending the  pilots Friday, offered no response Saturday to the comments about testing or  the suspensions. The pilots are not required by law to submit to testing after  a crash.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Questioned by Investigators  </P> <P> Pilot Michael Martin, 36, and co-pilot Constantine Kleissas, 29, submitted to  urinalysis Friday after five hours of questioning by federal investigators. The  results of the tests were not available Saturday.  </P> <P> Flight 5050 crashed into the East River late Wednesday when its takeoff was  aborted. Two people died and 59 others were rescued. The flight had been headed  to Charlotte, N.C.  </P> <P> At a news conference late Friday, Kolstad revealed that Kleissas -- attempting  his first operational takeoff of a Boeing 737-400 -- inadvertently pressed a  button that caused the plane to decelerate.  </P> <P> Martin then accelerated the plane, but decided to abort the takeoff because the  craft began drifting to the left and "the pilot felt and heard a vibration  which concerned him," Kolstad said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Runs Out of Room  </P> <P> Martin believed he had enough room on the runway to stop the plane, but it  instead skidded off the runway and into the water, cracking the fuselage into  three sections.  </P> <P> Kolstad also said that, as the plane accelerated down the runway, the captain,  acting as co-pilot, did not call out the jet's speed as required.  </P> <P> "It was clearly a lack of proper procedure being followed in the cockpit,"  Kolstad said. Lopatkiewicz said investigators were trying to find out what made  the plane drift to the left.  </P> <P> Kolstad also said reports that Martin appeared incoherent in the cockpit before  the crash were not true, and Kleissas apologized for making those remarks.  </P></p>

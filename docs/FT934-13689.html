			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading FOOTSIE futures suffered from directionless trading as dealers struggled to find a clear lead on the outlook for interest rate cuts or the economic recovery, writes Christine Buckley. The December contract on the FT-SE 100 opened a little above the previous night's close at 3,151, although it was fairly weak and could only muster a short-lived rally. That was on the back of a little optimism that downbeat CBI comments on the retail sector may force the chancellor of the exchequer's arm on interest rates. The high point of the contract was 3,159 in early trading. With no strong guidance, however, the general feeling remained mixed and the contract began to drift downwards. Arbitrage positions were opened and the sellers moved in. But the selling brought only a measured fall in the contract, as most of it was done by independent traders and lacked the clout of a withdrawal by institutions. By mid-morning the contract touched the day's low of 3,138, although later on the 3,145 mark proved a support level and December managed a moderate climb-back by lunchtime. Its close of 3,148 was a couple of points ahead of its fair value premium to cash, which is about 15 points. At 7,813 contracts traded, the volume was in line with recent levels. Of the stock options, Land Securities was the busiest with 4,911 lots traded.</p>

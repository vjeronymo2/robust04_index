			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / McAvoy survives leftwing challenge Mr Doug McAvoy has been re-elected general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, narrowly beating a far-left rival. Mr McAvoy, generally regarded as a Labour moderate, will now run the union for a further five years. The strong vote for his rival, Mrs Mary Hufford, suggested that the union's membership is continuing to shift to the left, following an annual conference dominated by hard-left factions. The NUT's militant opposition to the government's national curriculum tests seems unlikely to change. Mrs Hufford polled 37,329 votes to Mr McAvoy's 38,881, giving him a majority of 1,552. Turnout was 38.9 per cent. When elections were last held, the rivals to Mr McAvoy polled just 25,600 between them on the same turnout. Mrs Hufford had attacked Mr McAvoy for taking too moderate a stance on national curriculum tests and other issues, and had publicly criticised him for taking a salary of Pounds 67,000. She also said the union needed a female figurehead, as most of its members are women. The union will vote on a new deputy general secretary - who would be a likely successor to Mr McAvoy - in September. The winner is expected to be Mr Steve Sinnott, union president, who has said that he will be seeking nominations. He is also perceived as being from the union's 'broad left'.</p>

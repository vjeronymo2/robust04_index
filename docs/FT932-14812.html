			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / International Company News: Lanvin chairman replaced after concern over costs MR MICHEL Pietrini has been ousted as chairman of Lanvin, the French luxury goods group, just six months after the multi-million dollar relaunch of the company. He has been replaced by Mr Lois Armand, 41, a senior executive at L'Oreal, the French cosmetics company. L'Oreal three years ago bought Lanvin for over FFr400m (Dollars 74.38m at current exchange rates) in a joint venture with Orcofi, the investment consortium founded by Mr Henry Recamier, former head of the Louis Vuitton luggage business following his defeat in the battle for control of the LVMH group. L'Oreal and Orcofi are believed to have become concerned both about the cost of the relaunch and Lanvin's mounting losses. The luxury goods market has suffered severely in the world recession. Lanvin is believed to have lost FFr120m in each of 1991 and 1992.</p>

			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / US Mid-Term Elections (November 8): Kennedy pulls back from abyss - Reports of senator's political death could be premature Suddenly it seems that Mr Edward Kennedy, in his 32nd year as a US senator, can look forward to another six in Washington representing his native Massachusetts. He emerged relatively unsca-thed from his first televised debate with Mr Mitt Romney, his Republican challenger, on Tuesday night. Simultaneously two local polls gave him leads of 12 and 18 points, a vast improvement on last month when his edge had all but evaporated. The prospect of liberal Massachusetts voting against one of the great liberals in the Senate had been unthinkable. The state and the Kennedy name have been indivisible for generations, with his hold on office not even seriously threatened by the 1969 tragedy of Chappaquiddick when he drove a car off a bridge and a young woman companion drowned. Yet, however improbably, he had appeared to be in trouble as the Republicans went after the three great liberal scalps they would love to remove from office - Mr Kennedy, Governor Mario Cuomo of New York, and, in the state of Washington, Mr Tom Foley, Speaker of the House. The senator's particular vulnerability stems partly from his political longevity in a year when incumbency is a dirty word and, partly, because, at 62 and overweight, his image as a tired and ageing satyr looked as if it were catching up with him. Mr Romney certainly offered a contrasting candidacy. He is the wholesome 47-year-old venture capitalist son of Mr George Romney, former governor of Michigan who was well in the running for the 1968 Republican presidential nomination before he confessed to having been 'brainwashed' into supporting the Vietnam war. Though a political neophyte, Mr Romney's policy prescriptions - more business and less government - challenged Mr Kennedy's belief in the efficacy of government. Conservative positions have, after all, taken root even in Massachusetts, with Governor Bill Weld, the Republican, not only popular but virtually certain of re-election next month. Thus, barely two weeks ago, the columnists had begun to foresee Mr Kennedy's demise. From the right, Mr George Will gleefully proclaimed: 'Massachusetts may be the Jurassic Park of American politics where the dinosaur of liberalism lumbers on oblivious to the fact that its era has long since past. But the Tyrannosaurus Rex is endangered.' From the left, Ms Ellen Goodman found 'a whiff of defeat in the fall air' in a race 'that looks more and more like a beauty contest'. She quoted a sad Kennedy supporter saying 'he looks like a homeless man in a thousand dollar suit'. What has happened is that Mr Kennedy has begun to fight - and with plenty of assistance from outside the state. President Bill Clinton, whose ratings in Massachusetts are the highest in the nation, has already campaigned with the senator once and plans to do so again. The Kennedy he knew, Mr Clinton said, was not some liberal ideologue but more capable than any Democrat in the Senate of persuading Republicans to come out of the bunker of eternal resistance. Mr Kennedy was certainly combative in a sharp and often rancorous debate on Tuesday night. When his opponent accused him of making profits on a Washington real estate deal 'at the taxpayers' expense',Mr Kennedy shot back, invoking the tragedies that have visited his family. 'Mr Romney, the Kennedys are not in public service to make money. We have paid too high a price.' Mr Romney gave as good as he got. When Mr Kennedy charged he had refused healthcare to part-time employees, the Republican said the Kennedy family had done the same at one of its businesses. The post-debate scorecards mostly pointed to a draw, but, as one Boston political seer put it: 'If Kennedy didn't lose, he won, and if Romney didn't win, he lost.'</p>

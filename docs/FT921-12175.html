			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): NHS is accused of sexism SEXIST stereotyping about the abilities and 'natural' role of women prevents them from being appointed to top health authority jobs, according to a report published yesterday, Diane Summers writes. Only one of the UK's 14 regional health authorities is chaired by a woman and only 16 per cent of district health authorities are chaired by women. Of the first 57 National Health Service trusts, only three are headed by women. Earlier this month the Department of Health said shortlists for senior NHS management jobs should include female candidates. Targets were also set for increasing the number of general management posts held by women from 18 per cent to 30 per cent. Yesterday's report from the National Association of Health Authorities and Trusts and the King's Fund Centre is being backed by Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health minister. It found that informal procedures and the 'old boy network' worked against the selection of women. Suitable women could be found if they were sought out, said the report. Where Are The 'Good' Women?

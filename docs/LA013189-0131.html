			<p><P> January 31, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> FELLOW BRONCO FANS OFFER TO PAY FOR BLIND MAN'S SEASON TICKET  </P> <P> After 22 years as a season-ticket holder for Denver Broncos games, Bobbie  Shepard thought he had to sell out, but the 68-year-old blind man will be  keeping his ticket, thanks to fellow Bronco fans.  </P> <P> Shepard placed a classified ad in Sunday's Denver Post, offering to sell his  45-yard-line season ticket because a recent price increase of $5 per ticket  made the $300 cost too much for his income.  </P> <P> But after a story in the Denver newspaper detailed his problem, Shepard's phone  began ringing off the hook.  </P> <P> "The first one came at 6:30 in the morning," Shepard said. "I tried to eat my  breakfast, but I couldn't get it eaten. Every time I took a bite the phone  would ring again."  </P> <P> By the time it stopped, Shepard had 15 offers to pay for his $300 ticket.  </P> <P> By 10 a.m., Boulder lawyer Dan Caplis had arrived at Shepard's home and handed  him a check for the $300, and offered to pay for the ticket every season  Shepard wants it.  </P> <P> "I'm happy to do it," Caplis said. "I think the Broncos need more fans like  Bobbie. It just seemed to me that he was a gutsy, courageous guy, and he should  be there. It only seems right."  </P> <P> Thanks to another offer, Shepard and his guide dog, Heidi, no longer will have  to ride the bus to Bronco games.  </P> <P> "A lady called and told me that her seats are just above mine, and that she and  her husband had talked to me at some of the ballgames," he said.  </P> <P> "She said, 'It's wonderful the way you and your dog get around, but we don't  live very far from you.' So she told me they would pick me up and take me to  the games and bring me home."  </P> <P> The whole experience left Shepard a little overwhelmed.  </P> <P> "I think this shows there are a lot of good people out there," he said. "I'm so  thankful. I don't really know what to say."  </P></p>

			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / Leading Article: India's chance Mr PV Narasimha Rao, India's prime minister, did not win a resounding vote of confidence in six recent state elections. But his main opposition, the Bharatiya Janata party, fared even worse. Voters' broad rejection of the BJP's Hindu militancy appears to shore up the Congress government. It now has an opportunity to press on with the economic reform programme, its main, though incomplete, achievement. Younger companies and business people in Bombay revel in the freedom created by the end of industrial licensing and the liberalisation of trade, investment and foreign exchange. With bureaucratic obstacles reduced, there is no longer a need to shuttle constantly to Delhi, seeking licences. Foreign investors too have been gaining confidence that there has been a true change of direction. Yet reform has still not delivered rapid growth of exports or the economy. Industrialists who once enjoyed cosy markets are complaining that they do not have a 'level playing field' against foreign entrants, forgetting that the previous tilt in their favour prevented them from gaining the technological and managerial skills they needed. Mr Rao should encourage pro-reform voices to argue that Indian business needs less protection, not more, if it is to compete with China and other dynamic economies to the east. Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister and architect of the reforms, needs strong support as he prepares for the budget in February. Since electoral considerations will begin to obtrude by 1995, this will be his best opportunity to make significant progress. However, his ability to do so is limited by political constraints. The determination of the Congress party to alter the way India is run - with big government and extensive patronage - will be measured by its willingness to reform and shrink the public sector, to allow companies to shed redundant labour forces and to stop banks making cheap farm loans they do not expect to recover. Mr Singh can be expected to proceed with what he has begun. He will cut subsidies and raise administered prices (a process made more urgent by the damage which the state elections have been allowed to do to the budget deficit). He will also cut tariffs and proceed with the tax reforms designed to compensate for a fall in customs duties. He will probably allow greater private and foreign participation in financial services and in the development of infrastructure. All such measures should be applauded, but the government will eventually have to address the broader and more demanding reform agenda, which will mean taking head on the powerful vested interests which stand in the way. There is no alternative if the country is to compete with its east Asian neighbours.</p>

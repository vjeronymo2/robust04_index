			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Observers have not been able to find a reason for  the escalation of the Sudanese measures against Egypt at this  particular time. According to exclusive information available  to AL-'ARABI, the reason is this: The Sudanese opposition radio  station has begun its transmission and is now heard in Khartoum.  The Sudanese Government holds Cairo responsible.    However, according to information, the opposition radio is  being hired from an overseas country for $500 per hour, is  transmitting to Sudan through satellite, and Cairo has  absolutely nothing to do with it. In fact, Egypt had rejected  numerous requests from the Sudanese opposition to allow the  radio to transmit from Cairo, and this has worsened the  relations between the two sides for several months.    The radio was launched by the personal efforts of some  academic and military elements independent of the Sudanese  opposition group. Those elements tried to activate the  opposition in light of the poor performance of the National  Sudanese Grouping as a result of disagreements between the Ummah  Party and the Sudanese Communist Party over the grouping's  internal structure. The disagreements also led to differences  between the two main parties, the Ummah Party and the Democratic  Unionist Party [DUP], and this necessitated the presence of DUP  Chairman Muhammad 'Uthman al-Mirghani in Cairo to try to contain  the crisis.    The danger of the opposition radio, which began two hours of  transmission daily, is that it ends the isolation of the  Sudanese citizen and obstructs the regime's media hegemony.  This is a threat to the regime itself, especially given the  worsening domestic problems. [passage omitted]</p>

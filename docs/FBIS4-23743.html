			<p>BFN     [Text] The Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] is conducting  elections of local leaders in Prefecture Byumba. The exercise  started on 12 June 1994 in Mukarange and Muranda sectors, in  Prefecture Byumba. The elections were conducted democratically  and (?peacefully). After the elections, the RPF officials  explained the RPF political approach to Rwanda's problems. The  delay in the implementation of the Arusha peace agreements and  why the RPF has been forced to resume fighting were also  explained to the gathering. The officials of the RPF repeated  the call on the people who have fled their homes to return and  settle down, for the RPF has re-established security for all  persons in the areas under their control. The RPF chairman,  Colonel Alexis Kanyarengwe, has said that even the Republican  National Movement for Democracy and Development militias, who  will lay down their arms and stop committing atrocities, will be  free to go home and settle down.</p>

Michai Wirawaithaya, a former Thai cabinet official and  anti-AIDS activist, said in Phnom Penh that AIDS poses a threat  to Cambodia and is comparable to a big time bomb that will cause  a tragedy if the Cambodian Government ignores its spread.  Citing Thailand as an example, Michai said recognition of  reality and of the importance of preventing AIDS will lead to a  successful remedy of the problem. The successful Thai campaign  to inform the public about AIDS prevention has reduced the  contraction of AIDS in Thailand from 1,200 to 600 cases daily,  or 50 percent prevention effectiveness. Michai plans to invite  members of the Cambodian Government's National AIDS Prevention  Committee to observe AIDS prevention efforts and the final  stages of AIDS infection cases in Thailand.    On cooperation with Laos, Dr. Siriwat Thiptharawadon, the  Nong Khai Province public health officer, said that in order to  cope with contagious diseases -- including AIDS -- that will  follow the increased convenience of travel between Thailand and  Laos after the April opening of the Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge,  Nong Khai Province will stage a medical and public health  seminar with 75 Thai and Lao officials concerned with the  control of contagious diseases. The seminar is aimed at  formulating suggestions, ways, and plans to combat contagious  diseases along the Thai-Lao border, particularly after the  opening of the Friendship Bridge. It is also aimed at  increasing understanding among these officials in control of  contagious diseases and effecting coordination between the two  countries in case of epidemics.</p>

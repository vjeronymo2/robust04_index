			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> SEN. PACKWOOD LACES INTO LABOR  </P> <P> Sen. Bob Packwood (R-Ore.) angrily stormed out of a meeting with labor leaders  after one member of the group threatened that they would not vote for him if he  did not help cut rising gasoline prices.  </P> <P> "I'm not going to take these threats," Packwood said Thursday.  </P> <P> "I've busted my butt for your people for years. I've fought for you guys. To  have that kind of threat . . . see you later."  </P> <P> Officials of the Oregon State District Council of Carpenters met Packwood on  the steps of the Embarcadero Resort Hotel, saying the group should not be held  responsible for the comments of one man.  </P> <P> But Packwood said the group's conduct had been "ungentlemanly" and added before  leaving, "Don't count on me any more, fellas."  </P></p>

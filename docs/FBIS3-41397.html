Their latest success was a few days ago, when a Cork man in  his mid-30s was arrested at Paris Airport with almost 2,000 LSD  tablets hidden on his person. He had picked up the drugs in  Amsterdam, a popular location for such purchases, and was en  route to Cork when arrested by French police.    This is the second such courier arrested within months  following tip-offs from customs official on the Continent.  Another Cork man was taken into custody at Cork Airport with 350  LSD tablets when he arrived there from Amsterdam last August.    The same Cork drugs ring is responsible for most of the  imports of such hallucinogenic drugs and regularly use  people--often young and in debt--to bring them into this country.    Last March another Cork man died when condoms which held  about 300 ecstasy tablets burst inside his body. He was on a  Ryanair flight from Stansted to London at the time. Gardai  believe they were also bound for the Cork market.    Gardai said there is considerable co-operation between  Interpol and international customs in helping to track the  couriers.</p>

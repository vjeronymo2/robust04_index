			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Everyone a runner-up in win a holiday 'contests' Win a free holiday in the US] The promise of that prize in competitions promoted at travel fairs and on railway platforms found many willing takers across the UK in recent years. Entrants were later delighted to receive telephone calls saying that while they had not won the US holiday, they were runners-up and had won a Caribbean cruise. The problem was, everyone who entered a competition - apart from the winner  -was declared a runner-up, and going on the cruise involved paying for a variety of additional services, according to Mr Christopher Roan, Cambridgeshire's assistant chief trading standards officer. Yesterday, Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, said he had started legal proceedings against the company concerned - Inter-Club Travel of Cambridge. Sir Bryan said 46 county court judgments against Inter-Club had been brought to his attention. The judgments resulted in damages of more than Pounds 16,000 being paid to consumers. He said the company had told him the judgments were awarded because it did not defend itself. He said, however, that the judgments indicated the company acted in a way that was detrimental to consumers' interests. Sir Bryan said: 'We have used our best endeavours, without success, to get assurances from Inter-Club Travel and its officers about their future behaviour. Legal action has become necessary.' Inter-Club had also been convicted on four occasions in 1992 and 1993 of offences under the Consumer Protection Act, relating to misleading price information. It had been fined a total of Pounds 8,200. Legal proceedings are to be taken against the company and two of its officers, Mr Theodor Thomson and Mr William Wood, and Mr Ajit Kumar Patel, a former officer. The Association of British Travel Agents said it had received repeated complaints about Inter-Club, even though it was not an Abta member. The complaints concerned press advertisements offering holidays in Florida and the Bahamas for Pounds 99.50. Consumers who tried to take up the offer were asked for extra payments which brought the total cost of the holiday to Pounds 1,000 or more, Abta said. Mr Roan said Inter-Club had gone into liquidation earlier this month but was now trading under another name. Inter-Club could not be contacted.</p>

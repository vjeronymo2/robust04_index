			<p><P> July 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSUMER VIEWS: WHILE PHONE RINGS, CHARGES MAY BEGIN  </P> <P> Question: This is in reference to my MCI phone bill. I have noticed several  calls for one minute. These were to residences with answering machines that  answer on the fifth ring. I am always careful to hang up on the third or fourth  ring. I have also often noticed that when calling and hanging up before the  answering machine has answered -- and then calling back to verify the party  won't answer -- that the phone is often busy, leading me to believe that the  answering machine has indeed answered after I'd hung up.  </P> <P> Upon calling MCI about this problem, I was first told that "obviously" I'm not  hanging up before the machine answers or I wouldn't have been charged for the  call. Upon request, I spoke to a manager, however, who told me that when I call  a number with an answering machine -- no matter how soon I hang up -- I will be  charged because the two machines have made a connection.  </P> <P> She therefore refused to reimburse me for these calls and told me all  long-distance companies have the same problem because of this "connection" over  which they have no control.  </P> <P> I called AT&amp;T and was told that they charge only when a person, or a  machine, actually answered. But my mother has AT&amp;T and has the same problem  I do. With so many answering machines these days, I feel ripped off being  charged for calls that are not complete. What is really going on here?  </P> <P>  -- J.T.  </P> <P> Answer: We all tend to conduct our lives on the basis of old, time-honored  belief: "Barking dogs never bite," or "every cloud has a silver lining."  </P> <P> Or, in modern America: "If you hang up on a telephone answering machine before  it connects, you're not charged for the call."  </P> <P> The irony of this situation is that you got two apparently contradictory  responses from the two biggies in the long-distance phone business. AT&amp;T  told you that you're charged only "when a person or a machine actually  answered," and MCI told you that you are charged when "the two machines make a  connection." Would you believe that both answers are perfectly valid?  (Although, admittedly, it's an oversimplification to suggest that you are going  to be charged "no matter how soon" you hang up. If you are nimble enough, it  can be done.)  </P> <P> </P> <P> Odd Situation  </P> <P> This is an odd situation in that the spokespersons for both communications  companies were themselves not sure of how toll charges relate to answering  machines until they had checked with their technical people.  </P> <P> Here's how it works: You call a number serviced by an answering machine (and  they can be set to respond on anywhere from the first ring to the fifth). About  "2 to 3 seconds" before the ringing stops and the pause indicating that the  machine is about to respond, there is a distinct click on the line. This is  described by Victor Bhoot, a technical coordinator for Panasonic's technical  training department, as "a plunger in the relay making contact with the  cassette player." And this is when the telephone company's meter starts  running.  </P> <P> (In the interest of such lofty research, we armed our own answering machine --  which is set to answer on the third ring -- left the house and, equipped with a  stopwatch, called our own number from a pay phone. The phone rang twice  completely and then, 12 seconds after the first ring had begun, there was a  very noticeable click which, frankly, I had never noticed before. About 2 more  seconds elapsed -- while the phone was still ringing -- before the ringing  stopped and a silence of about 2 more seconds indicated that the recording tape  was running, but our message hadn't yet come through. I repeated the  experiment, hanging up instantly when I heard the click -- my coin was not  returned.)  </P> <P> "I think that a lot of people have this misunderstanding," said Liz Morris, a  public affairs spokesperson for AT&amp;T, "that if they hang up while the phone  is still ringing, the call hasn't gone through. Actually, the recording machine  has been triggered at the instant that click takes place, but in many cases the  caller is in the process of hanging up and doesn't have the phone at his ear,  and so he doesn't hear the click."  </P> <P> And Fran Zone, the senior manager of public affairs for MCI in San Francisco,  confirms that MCI operates the same way.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Trouble at First  </P> <P> "The technology that makes it possible has been in place for only a little more  than a year. When MCI first got started, the technology was such that we had a  lot of initial trouble with what we called 'ring-no-answer' -- where a phone  would ring for a long time and we didn't have the technology to draw the  distinction between ringing and talking.  </P> <P> "And so we had customers being charged for long-distance calls when, in  actuality, no one had ever answered. We got that straightened out, all right,  in time. This is a more sophisticated approach to the same sort of situation."  </P> <P> Just when the telephone answering machine kicks on isn't standardized (as far  as anyone knows) among the manufacturers.  </P> <P> "With Panasonic," a major supplier of the machines, "it's about 2 to 3  seconds," the company's Bhoot said, "and I would imagine it's about the same  for Phone-Mate or Sanyo or AT&amp;T and the other makers. But it's simply not  spelled out in any of our technical manuals."  </P> <P> Obviously there are elements of Russian roulette in all of this business of  trying to hang up before that tell-tale click happens. You have no way of  knowing whether the machine is set to answer on the first, second, third,  fourth or fifth ring.  </P> <P> A consensus among those queried is that answering on the third ring is the most  popular option. But there are plenty of variances.  </P> <P> "I set mine to answer on the second ring," AT&amp;T's Morris adds, "because if  I'm not at home, I think it's discourteous to make them sit there through five  long rings before that becomes obvious."  </P> <P> If you hang up too soon, you've nullified the point in calling. If you try to  time it too exactly, then you run the risk of having the click take place while  you're in the process of hanging up.  </P> <P> There's one possible moral in all this: If your timing is off and you hear the  click, you might just as well stay on the line long enough to announce  yourself.  </P> <P> Because you've paid for it anyway.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Campbell cannot answer mail personally but will respond in this column to  consumer questions of general interest.

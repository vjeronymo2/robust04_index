			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "A Summit of Parties in the Government"] </F>   [Text] There is a sign that the present government is not  doing very well. Prices in the stock market have fallen since  the beginning of this week, while stock prices in the foreign  stock markets have not gone down. Experts in the stock business  point out that apart from the outflow and withdrawal of foreign  capital invested in Thailand for profit-taking, another reason  for the drop of the stock index could be the present political  situation, which does not look so good. Such a situation makes  investors reluctant to remain in the market.    This kind of attitude seems very possible, because since the  beginning of the new year there have been observable conflicts  among the parties in the coalition government.    A clear case is that the Phalang Tham Party has tried to  bring up the issue of developing decentralization of  administration through the election of provincial governors --  an issue that the Democrat Party, a core in the government, does  not agree on. Strong verbal, irreconcilable conflicts have  ensued between members of the two parties, although compromises  were possible.    Another case is the conflict between the Democrat and  Solidarity Parties. The leader of Solidarity tried to dismiss a  permanent secretary on a charge that he failed to meet popular  demands. In fact, that is actually the job of the head of that  ministry.    These two cases make the people feel that there is a high  possibility that these two parties may no longer be able to get  along with each other in this government. At the same time,  there have also been extensive rumors that the Democrat Party  has approached at least two opposition parties that have enough  seats to ensure the government to continue its national  administration and made offers for them to join the government.    Regarding this news--which reflects government instability,  it is strange that the Democrat Party, and particularly its  leader Chuan Likphai, have neither shown any reaction nor any  tendency to correct or improve the image of the government. It  looks as if Chuan is content to let problems prevail until the  government collapses because of withdrawal of parties in the  coalition. This contradicts his actions in the early days of  the government, when the prime minister had to reach compromises  among the coalition parties whenever problems arose or  misunderstandings occurred.    We do not want to see rumors turn into reality by letting  parties in the government withdraw and inviting an opposition  party to join the coalition in an undignified manner. We want  to see leaders of all the parties in the present government hold  a meeting to discuss guidelines for solving problems or to  clearly make adjustments. All this is to ensure public  confidence that the government remains stable.    The prime minister should no longer remain indifferent and  let the situation resolve itself. This method of playing  politics will only cause the country as a whole to suffer more  losses. We want to see him move urgently on this matter. Do not  just threaten that if a government party pulls out, no  opposition party will be invited to join, but parliament would  be dissolved instead. Such a statement is just a threat, not  proper for a core party in the coalition government. While the  democracy-loving people hope to see this government last its  full four-year term, we wonder what has happened to the prime  minister and why he has remained so indifferent.</p>

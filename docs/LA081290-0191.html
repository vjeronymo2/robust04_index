			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEL MAR;  </P> <P> RIAL'S SURPRISE IN ESCONDIDO GIVES HIS JOCKEY FIRST VICTORY IN U.S.  </P> <P> The $81,525 Escondido Handicap didn't seem the likely spot for Jose Fernandez  to win his first race in the United States.  </P> <P> The 31-year-old jockey, who won his share of races in his native Argentina, was  on Rial, a 28-1 shot who hadn't come close in his three starts in this country  and had earned only $11,520 in his 12-race career.  </P> <P> Although Fernandez didn't look particularly pretty doing so, he was able to get  the 5-year-old Family Crest horse up in the final strides to beat 7-2 third  choice Mashkour by a head in 2:14 3/5 for the 1 3/8 miles on turf.  </P> <P> The victory also put trainer Vince Clyne back in the winner's circle for the  first time in ages. The man who trained, among others, Text, Visible and  Announcer, is back in business at 76 after retiring in 1985 due to health  reasons.  </P> <P> Rial is one of 10 horses under his care and Clyne wasn't very surprised he was  able to win the restricted Escondido.  </P> <P> "He had won a Group I in Argentina," he said. "They kind of underlooked him a  little today. He came over here last year and ran a good race against Criminal  Type (he finished sixth, beaten by five lengths in an allowance race Nov. 18 at  Hollywood Park). Then, we gave him some time off to acclimate. His two races at  Hollywood were against tough company."  </P> <P> Enrique Carlos Boelcke, Rial's owner, is the main reason Clyne decided to  return to training.  </P> <P> "I was in Argentina for a year and came back to training in March," he said. "I  had to get the right horses and (Boelcke) offered me some. I have three horses  for him here and seven others in Los Angeles."  </P> <P> Speaking through interpreter Pat Valenzuela, Fernandez, who came to the United  States 2 1/2 months ago, says he plans on remaining in California.  </P> <P> "The trainer told me to take this horse back and get him to relax, relax,  relax," he said. "He said wait until the last quarter mile, then go wide and  give it one last run. It worked out perfectly."  </P> <P> Mashkour, who took the lead briefly in deep stretch, was nearly two lengths  better than Valdali, the 8-5 favorite. Well-placed early by Eddie Delahoussaye,  Valdali made the lead into the stretch when a hole along the rail opened up,  but he was no match for the first two late.  </P> <P> "I had to move a bit sooner than I wanted to, but when I got through on the  inside, I thought I'd win it anyway," Delahoussaye said. "He was floundering a  bit at the beginning. I'm not sure he liked this course. But, we had a good  trip and I've got no real complaints."  </P> <P> The Escondido also might have marked the end of the line for Great  Communicator. The 3-1 second choice and arguably the nation's finest turf horse  in 1988 threw in another stinker.  </P> <P> Fifth in his 1990 debut last month at Hollywood Park, the 7-year-old Key To The  Kingdom gelding was just off pacesetter Miserden for a mile, then weakened late  to finish fifth.  </P> <P> "I got beat," Ray Sibille said. "That's really all I can say. He just came up  short. I don't know if he needs more racing or what. He just didn't have enough  today."  </P> <P> Solar Launch is proving to be an $80,000 bargain for trainer Robert Marshall.  </P> <P> Claimed by the optometrist-turned-horseman June 1 from Bobby Frankel, Solar  Launch, a 3-year-old son of Sassafras, has been nothing short of brilliant in  his two starts for Marshall.  </P> <P> In his first outing for his new barn June 17, Solar Launch equaled Hollywood  Park's record for 6 1/2 furlongs when he won by 5 1/2 lengths in 1:14 4/5.  </P> <P> Idle until Friday, he eclipsed Del Mar's seven-furlong record when he won the  Real Good Deal Stakes by 4 1/2 lengths in 1:20, a tick better than Olympic  Native went last year.  </P> <P> "I watched the tapes of his races before I claimed him," said Marshall, who  owns the horse in partnership with Warren Williamson, Hollywood Park's  secretary-treasurer.  </P> <P> "He was lugging out on turns and running crazed and losing two to three  lengths. I thought if we could correct that, it was the difference between  winning and losing. But, it looks like he's picked up six or seven lengths.  </P> <P> "We just made an effort to get him more relaxed. Tim Reavey, the exercise rider  who once worked Fappiano, has done a nice job. We always take him out at 5:15  and work on keeping him happy and relaxed. He's mellow now.  </P> <P> "He comes to that spot in the stretch and just accelerates. His race Friday was  just like at Hollywood Park. The jockey (Kent Desormeaux) geared him down at  the wire, too. Kent said he was pulling him out of the saddle the whole  backside."  </P> <P> Marshall, who decided three years ago he wanted to train horses, says he'll  keep Solar Launch, who has won on the grass, sprinting for now. "I'm going to  nominate him to the California Cup sprint and mile turf (Nov. 3 at Oak Tree)."  </P> <P> Horse Racing Notes  </P> <P> Enrique Carlos Boelcke, is a breeder from Buenos Aires who hopes to stay in the  U.S. as an assistant to Clyne. . . . Trainer Ron McAnally had two victories  Saturday. He took the third with Festin, who won his third in a row from far  back under Delahoussaye, and the seventh with Eighty Eight Keys. . . . Laffit  Pincay also had a double with Eighty Eight Keys and 9-1 shot Love Conquers All  in the fourth.  </P> <P> A field of eight is set for the $270,250 Eddie Read Handicap, the meeting's  first Grade I race. Golden Pheasant is the 122-pound highweight and the other  entrants, from the rail out, are Nediym, Notorious Pleasure, Fly Till Dawn,  Saratoga Passage, who won the race last year, Classic Fame, Companion and Soft  Machine.  </P></p>

[Divjak] Karadzic must explain to his people that he now  wants peace. He is reacting to pressure from NATO and Boris  Yeltsin.    [Klingl] Will NATO intervene if the Serbs neglect NATO  demands?    [Divjak] NATO will not bomb the Serbs. We now have a  stalemate in the political game. The Serbs are withdrawing a  few weapons, others they will shift to other areas of war.    [Klingl] Can a political solution be found through this  stalemate?    [Divjak] The Sarajevo solution could be successful one in  other parts of Bosnia as well, which would have a positive  influence on the negotiations.    [Klingl] Can you accept Russian blue helmets as monitoring  the Bosnian weapons?    [Divjak] The Bosnian Army is pleased to be monitored by  them. If they are used on the Serbian side, abuse cannot be  ruled out.    [Klingl] Would a division of Bosnia into three parts bring  about peace?    [Divjak] A division along ethnic lines would mean war again.  Our culture, history, and economy are interlaced; 900,000  marriages are mixed marriages.    [Klingl] Would you, a Serb, live in a Muslim state?    [Divjak] I am staying where I am. Here we will not have a  Muslim state but a country in which all citizens will have their  rights.    [Klingl] You negotiated the cease-fire with the Serbs. What  is it like to sit at the same table with the aggressors?    [Divjak] They did not want to negotiate with us because I  was there. I told them that this is not a question of wanting  but a question of a cease-fire. I am very glad that I am not on  the side of those who are committing genocide on the Muslims.</p>

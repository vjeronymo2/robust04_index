			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Personal View: Unemployment - a letter to Mr Delors You are right - European unemployment is a scandal. At 10 per cent, it is especially high just now because of the economic downturn. But the real scandal is the average level of unemployment in the European Community over the last five years - no less than 9 per cent of all workers. Since unemployment differs so much from one OECD country to another, your strategy of reform can draw on this experience. Three main features explain the varying levels of unemployment: how unemployed people are treated; how young people are trained; and how wages are determined. In most European Community countries unemployed people get money too easily and are give too little help. Generally unemployment benefits are available for a substantial period, often indefinitely. At the same time far too little is done to help people to become employable. Typically, only one in 10 of the unemployed receives training, and such training is often of poor quality. This deadly combination explains our long-term unemployment - more than a third of Europe's unemployed have been out of work for over a year. This long-term unemployment does nothing to control inflation, since those concerned are no longer of interest to employers and are thus an ineffective supply of labour. It is thus a total economic waste and dreadful fiscal burden. So we need a fresh approach, tailored to preventing long-term unemployment. This means spending money on active labour market measures in order to save money on benefits and lost taxes. It means a personnel placement officer for each unemployed person. It means more and better training. And in the last resort it means resources to buy jobs for hard-to-place workers. The way to deal with long-term unemployment is to prevent it. Once people are long-term unemployed it is very difficult to help them in any way that is cost-effective. Indeed, misguided attempts to do so account for many of the failures of active intervention. Instead, we need high-quality programmes for people who have been unemployed between six and 12 months. Once enough good programmes are in place, the duration of benefits can be cut to a year. Income maintenance beyond that point would then be conditional on work or training. Most unemployed people have lost a previous job through normal economic change, as some industries decline and others rise. They should be treated as an important resource for the industries of the future. We should no longer let them slide into self-distrust. Next, there is the problem of mismatch. The relative demand for skilled workers has been reduced by technological change and by low wages in the newly industrialised countries. But the pattern of skills in the European workforce has not adjusted adequately. To an extent the problem will correct itself, since the relative shortage of skilled labour has increased wage differentials and thus the incentive to acquire skill. But wages are not fully flexible and this generates an inefficient level of unemployment, requiring public intervention and public expenditure. Thus the 1990s have to be an era of educational expansion, as the 1960s were, but with a heavy focus on vocational education for the less able young people. One reason for low unemployment in Germany is its near universal system of skill training. Other European countries need to guarantee some training to every young person. Finally, Europe is the continent of trade unions. In this context, decentralised bargaining simply leads to wage leap-frogging as soon as unemployment is reduced. Wage restraint can only be achieved through higher unemployment or through employer solidarity and social consensus about wages. Tackling unemployment means tackling these three issues. There are many possible distractions - above all, the fallacy that, due to technical progress, it is ever more difficult to provide jobs. If that were so, we should nearly all be unemployed by now. There is no lump-of-output to be produced. Technology makes possible a better life. So there is no advantage in artificial inducements to early retirement or restricted hours of work. Unless we treat people as Europe's main resource, we cannot hope to return to full employment. But if we do so, we can at least guarantee everyone a job within one year. Why not make that a European goal for the decade?

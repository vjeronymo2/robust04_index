			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / International Company News: Nestle buys into ice-cream maker Nestle, the world's largest foods group, is buying a substantial minority stake in Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream of Oakland, California, for Dollars 106m. Nestle has agreed to buy 3m Dreyer's shares at Dollars 32 a share, plus warrants to purchase a further 2m shares at the same price later. The 5m shares would give Nestle a 22 per cent stake in Dreyer's, which is quoted on the Nasdaq over-the-counter market. The first part of the transaction would cost Nestle Dollars 106m and give it the right to name two Dreyer's directors. The two companies have agreed that Dreyer's will distribute Nestle frozen novelties and ice cream in selected markets from next year. Dreyer's, which sells under the Dreyer's and Edy's brand names, had consolidated net sales for the 13-week period to March 26 of Dollars 112m, 9 per cent higher than in the comparable period. Net income for the first quarter was down 25.7 per cent to Dollars 1.58m, or 11 cents per common share.</p>

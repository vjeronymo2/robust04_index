			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Cumbria (3): Crowd control a priority - Tourism THIS IS a good time of year to be visiting Cumbria. The chances of rain are much as they are in any other season, but the autumn colours in Lakeland are the best, the crowds have receded, and there is an air of mellowness which becomes the ancient, weather-beaten fells, and the stone-walled farms and villages. If you do go, you will be pleasing the Cumbria Tourist Board which is trying to spread the tourist season away from the summer peak. And that matters, because Lakeland's problem is increasingly one of over-use: too many cars, fellwalkers and speedboats. Not that this year has seen much increase in those pressures. The CTB's mid-year survey showed fewer than a third of tourism businesses enjoyed more custom than last year. 'The recession has certainly bitten up here, though I think Cumbria is holding up better than most,' says Mrs Judy Johnson who runs holiday cottages at Cartmel. In a typical year, people make about 2.75m trips to Cumbria and spend over Pounds 300m. The average holiday is 12 days. These figures include about 250,000 foreigners who pass through for a night or two. Tourism now ranks number two in the county after manufacturing, surpassing farming which is in decline - itself a matter of concern to the tourist industry. Cumbrian tourism falls into two broad categories: the central area with the beauties of the Lake District, and the outlying areas with fewer obvious charms but much eagerness to share in the benefits. The CTB's policy is to try and sustain the growth of the industry, though without harming the very attractions that people come to see. Some might feel that that is an impossible task. On a hot August week-end traffic can come to a virtual standstill, while anyone struggling to the top of the Old Man of Coniston might just as well be standing on Brighton beach. The resulting wear and tear can be considerable. The National Park is working with local authorities on a traffic management project. Large maintenance works are under way to repair fellside trails, and conserve lake and river shores. A row is also rumbling over plans to impose a 10mph speed limit on Lake Windermere to limit noise. Other attacks on the environment can seem more gratuitous. A notorious case is the plan to build a windfarm on Kirkby Moor overlooking Ulverston. This site, admittedly on the fringes of the Lake District but nonetheless prominent, is to be dotted with 12 giant windmills to produce electricity at a time when the big national generation companies are closing down plant because of a capacity surplus. One way of dealing with the pressure from tourism is to encourage people to come at different times, or visit more out of the way places, such as the Eden Valley to the east, Carlisle to the north, and Cartmel and Furness to the south. An area that is keen to attract more visitors is the west, which has been badly hit by declining industries but enjoys none of the benefits of communities close to the M6 in the east. An ambitious programme to raise the number of visitors by 5 per cent a year during the 1990s and to create 1,000 jobs is ahead of target. 'Even though we're in recession, the numbers are growing,' says Joan Ellis of the West Cumbria Development Agency. The region's appeal include the western lakes and fells, the seaside and specific attractions like Muncaster Castle and the Ravenglass miniature railway. A surprising hit has been the Sellafield nuclear facility - once denounced as a blight by the local tourist business - which now draws 150,000 visitors a year with its open-door policy. The quality of Cumbrian tourism depends a lot on the strength of local support. As it becomes more of a year-round business, it provides more secure employment, and efforts are being made to improve training of staff and involve local communities. But Cumbria's farm population is shrinking - specially in the uplands - as the economics of Lakeland agriculture deteriorates because of tight prices and production quotas. The fear is that as the farming community dwindles, so will the well-cared-for appearance of the Lake District itself. To combat this, the county last year launched the Upland Cumbria Initiative, a fund to help farmers maintain the fabric of the area by repairing dry stone walls and improving footpaths - something they previously did as a 'free' service.</p>

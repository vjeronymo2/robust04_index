			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / World Bank/IMF Meeting: Russia hopes to stabilise budget soon RUSSIA has told the Group of Seven leading industrial nations that it hopes to stabilise its budget position this year so it can qualify for more financial aid from the IMF. At a meeting on Saturday with G7 finance ministers and central bank governors, Mr Boris Fyodorov, the Russian finance minister, described Russian plans to cut subsidies on grain and bread production, change taxes and remove indexation with the aim of cutting the budget deficit and inflation by late this year. At that time the IMF might be able to release a second Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1bn) loan to Russia under its systemic transformation facility to help Russia's difficult move towards a market economy, G7 officials said. At the end of Saturday's meeting, the finance ministers from the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada 'expressed their very strong hope' that the political developments of the past week 'will help Russia achieve a decisive breakthrough on the path of market reform'. The ministers praised President Boris Yeltsin's commitment to pursue the path of market-oriented reform, which they saw as right for creating a better future for the Russian people and integrating Russia into the world economy. But before meeting Mr Fyodorov, the G7 ministers decided among themselves that new financial support should not be given to Russia before it had brought its economic reform programme back on the track laid down by the IMF during the summer. 'There was a general sense among G7 officials that the provision of stabilisation support has to be measured with the progress of reform,' a US Treasury official said. 'It must be help for self-help,' declared Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, who said Mr Fyodorov had made no request for an easing of the economic policy conditions on which the IMF support has been based.</p>

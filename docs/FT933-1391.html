			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Treasury signals further sell-offs THERE WAS 'significantly more scope' for privatisation or contracting out of central government functions than had previously been envisaged, a Treasury minister said yesterday. In remarks which will raise expectations that there may be more government sell-offs, Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, said the privatisation programme had been 'one of the clear successes of the last 14 years'. Mr Dorrell, who was speaking to the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, said that departments must ask whether the in-house provision of a service 'enhances or detracts from' core functions. 'When once government asked 'what shall we sell?' We now ask 'what must we keep?'' he said. Reporting on discussions he had held on future plans with departmental ministers, Mr Dorrell said five questions had been asked about departmental activities: can it be abolished?; can it be privatised?; can it be contracted out?; can it be market-tested?; and can it be given agency status?</p>

			<p><P> March 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARMED SERVICES PANEL MEMBERS FILE CONFLICTING VIEWS ON TOWER  </P> <P> The 11 Democrats on the Senate Armed Services Committee said in a report  Tuesday that John Tower has a record of excessive drinking and indiscreet  behavior with women that disqualifies him from becoming President Bush's  secretary of defense.  </P> <P> Nine Republicans on the same committee, however, insisted that there was no  credible evidence that Tower ever allowed alcohol to interfere with the  performance of his duties and said he is "fully and ably qualified" to take  over the Pentagon. He never had sexual liaisons that could subject him to  blackmail or embarrass the United States, they added, and his other  relationships with women were private and none of the committee's business.  </P> <P> The 11 Democrats said Tower's switch from being a U.S. nuclear arms negotiator  to a highly paid consultant for major defense contractors "created the  appearance of using inside information for private gain." The nine GOP members,  however, said the panel was trying to set a "new standard" and declared that  Tower had no conflict of interest.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Backdrop for Battle  </P> <P> The majority and minority views were filed with the Senate, providing a written  backdrop for a floor battle over Tower's confirmation expected to begin today  with odds apparently against the former Texas senator.  </P> <P> The detailed allegations, however, were omitted from the report and kept for  senators' eyes only in a secret repository in the form of an addition to the  majority report, together with eight installments of FBI reports on Tower's  conduct.  </P> <P> In general, the portions made public repeated familiar arguments made by  advocates and opponents of Tower's nomination without any startling new  disclosures.  </P> <P> The Democratic report, however, said one document relating to Tower's service  as an arms negotiator in Geneva was "destroyed" by the Office of Personnel  Management "as a routine matter" despite the committee's request for it.  </P> <P> Even so, the panel received another copy of the document from the House Energy  and Commerce Committee, the report said. The committee majority concluded there  was no evidence, however, that Tower was involved with foreign nationals in a  way that would constitute a security risk.  </P> <P> In their report, the Democrats said Tower has a number of strong qualifications  for the defense secretary's job but their overall assessment was unfavorable.  </P> <P> The Democrats also charged there were "significant inconsistencies" in what  Tower told the FBI at first, what he told them later, what he told the  committee in closed session and what he has said in public statements about his  use of alcohol. But it gave no examples, saying they could be found in the  addendum available for senators' viewing only.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Indiscreet Behavior'  </P> <P> "These concerns included: (1) excessive use of alcohol; (2) the provision of  consulting services to defense contractors on the probable outcomes of ongoing,  confidential arms control negotiations shortly after serving as an arms control  negotiator, which created the appearance of using public office for private  gain; and (3) a number of incidents of indiscreet behavior toward women," the  report said.  </P> <P> Republicans, however, disagreed on all three counts. They said Tower's private  life -- his relationships with women that would not subject him to blackmail or  embarrass the United States -- should not even be a matter for the committee's  attention.  </P> <P> "We reject the recommendation of the majority because it is apparently based  upon a body of fact and allegation lacking the weight of corroboration required  by Senate precedents of 200 years," the nine GOP senators said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PANEL NARROWLY SUPPORTS FSX PROPOSAL  </P> <P> The Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted narrowly today to approve the  $7-billion U.S.-Japanese program to develop and co-produce the advanced FSX  fighter plane for Japan.  </P> <P> On a 9-8 vote, the committee rejected a resolution to disapprove the deal,  which has sparked strong criticism on Capitol Hill over technological and  economic issues.  </P> <P> A companion resolution of disapproval has been introduced in the House.  </P> <P> Today's committee action on the FSX followed a closed-door intelligence  briefing for the Senate panel on Japanese involvement in a suspected Libyan  chemical weapons complex.  </P> <P> Sen. Frank H. Murkowski (R-Alaska) requested the briefing, saying, "I want to  be certain that our co-producers of the FSX, or their associates, are not also  co-producing chemical containment components for Libya.  </P> <P> "If there is Japanese involvement in Libyan chemical warfare production, we  have the opportunity with the FSX to leverage them out," he added.  </P> <P> Murkowski's concern focused on an industrial complex being built at Rabta, in  the desert southwest of the Libyan capital of Tripoli. U.S. officials believe  that the complex includes a poison gas plant as well as a metal fabrication  plant to produce bomb and shell casings.  </P> <P> At a hearing Wednesday, Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger told  the Senate committee that there is no evidence that Mitsubishi Heavy  Industries, the prime Japanese contractor for the FSX, had any involvement with  the Rabta complex.  </P> <P> Even if resolutions of disapproval to try to block the FSX clear both the full  Senate and House, a two-thirds majority in both chambers would be required to  override a likely presidential veto.  </P> <P> Under the deal, General Dynamics and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries would jointly  develop and produce the FSX.  </P></p>

			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Airtours holders take up 83% of convertible pref offer SHAREHOLDERS IN Airtours, the holiday company bidding for rival Owners Abroad, have taken up 83 per cent of the convertible preference shares available under a fully underwritten offer to raise Pounds 49.5m. About 24.2m of the 50.6m shares on offer - representing the entitlement of Airtours' directors - were firmly pre-placed with institutional investors. As a result, shareholders who are not directors clawed back only 67.5 per cent of their entitlement from institutions where the shares had been conditionally placed. Airtours announced the placing at the time of its bid but the placing was not conditional on the bid being accepted by Owners Abroad shareholders. Advisers for Airtours said they were pleased with the placing. Mr Howard Klein, Owners Abroad chairman, said the result of the open offer raised 'serious concerns as to the underlying value of Airtours' shares' which, he said 'represent an unattractive and vulnerable investment.' Airtours offer for Owners Abroad contains only a partial cash alternative. Airtours' shares slipped 1p to 280p yesterday, valuing the bid at Pounds 208.9m. The company has said that if its offer is not accepted by Owners Abroad shareholders, the Pounds 49.5m raised will be used to expand Airtours' tour operating and travel agency businesses. Mr David Crossland, Airtours chairman, said that unlike Owners Abroad, Airtours had managed to extract consistent growth in value for shareholders. He said that bookings for the winter season were currently 19 per cent ahead of the same period last year while for the 1993 summer season they were 12 per cent ahead.</p>

			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Observer: Casualty Bad luck for Inter-Continental Hotels that on the day that it announced it was returning to Beirut, after an 18-year absence, Israel sent an armoured column including tanks and personnel carriers into south Lebanon. Fortunately, the 600-room Phoenicia Inter-Continental which used to be the Middle East's premier hostelry, is not scheduled to reopen until January 1995 - by which time there might be a more permanent ceasefire.</p>

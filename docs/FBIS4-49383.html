			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, May 5 (XINHUA) -- Azerbaijan today rejected  a peace plan on Nagorno-Karabakh made by the Interparliamentary  Conference of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).    Russian media reports quoted Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of  the CIS interparliamentary conference, as saying that Azerbaijan  does not recognize Nagorno-Karabakh as one side of the conflict  in that region.    He said that if Nagorno-Karabakh is not involved in signing  a  peace plan, no ceasefire will be guaranteed.    Parliament leaders of some CIS countries held a mediation  meeting on Nagorno-Karabakh this week in the Central Asia  republic of Kyrgyzstan.    Another side of the conflict, Armenia, has accepted the  peace  plan, which calls for the deployment of a CIS peacekeeping force  in Nagorno-Karabakh, and the application by all sides of a  ceasefire beginning on May 9.    Azerbaijan has also rejected a Russian plan to send a CIS  peacekeeping force to the conflict region, and instead wants an  international peacekeeping force.    Shumeyko, who is also chairman of the Russian upper house of  parliament, said inviting an international peacekeeping force is  not logically sound since Nagorno-Karabakh is situated within  the CIS. Therefore, it is the CIS that should send peacekeepers,  he said.    Azerbaijan regards Nagorno-Karabakh as a part of its  sovereignty and insists that the region has been occupied by  Armenia.    Nagorno-Karabakh used to be an autonomous region within  Azerbaijan, and is largely populated by Armenians.    A separation movement began in 1988 and led to the  declaration of an independent republic in the region in  September 1991.    During four years of conflict in the region, an estimated  3,000 Armenians and 4,700 Azerbaijanis were killed.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Masayoshi Takemura, representative of Shinto  Sakigake [Harbinger], granted an interview to NIHON KEIZAI  SHIMBUN on 29 April, and revealed his party's plans to deal with  the political situation arising in the wake of the launching of  the minority Hata government. He said while his party's ties  with the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] will be  strengthened, exchanges with Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]  members will be stepped up by holding joint study meetings, for  instance.    As far as the question of tax system reform is concerned, he  said the ruling coalition's target to finalize an agreement plan  by mid-June should be delayed substantially--until it receives  the public's agreement. Regarding the zoning of the single-seat  districts for the House of Representatives election, he said the  matter should be finalized even if it means the Diet session is  extended. He thus indicated his party is willing to cooperate  in having the bill passed by the Diet.    Commenting on the Hata government which began on 28 April,  Takemura said: "It is a Shinseito-Komeito joint government; and  viewed by the political world, a split-power government."  Explaining the position of Sakigake--a party which promised to  cooperate with the government while not joining it--with respect  to the Hata government, he said: "This is a new situation in  which the coalition became a minority government after the SDPJ  bolted from it. There are powerful opposition forces. Once the  current Diet session closes, and if new policy matters arise to  be dealt with, we will judge them on a case by case basis after  fully reviewing them."    On the issue of tax system reform, Takemura indicated his  party would support the basic policy agreement made by the  coalition parties, saying: "Increasing taxes, primarily  indirect taxes, is unavoidable." But he noted the coalition  parties' Tax System Reform Council's work is going slowly, and  added: "Even if the Hata government were not a minority  government, there is insufficient time to get public concensus  on the matter. An inability to meet the target [of mid-June]  may be unavoidable." He thus gave his view that the government  should not be too concerned about arriving at an agreement on  the matter by mid-June and should instead give ample time to  discussing it.    On the electoral district redistricting bill, he said: "My  view and Prime Minister Hata's are the same. We should get a  recommendation (from the council on redistricting the House of  Representatives electoral districts) and act on the bill within  the current session or an extended session of the Diet, rather  than wait for the fall session."    What he meant was that the bill on redistricting should be  enacted soon even by extending the current Diet session. He  emphasized: "I mean to support the government as far as the  1994 budget bill, budget-related bills, the redistricting bill,  and political reform programs are concerned." Asked what he  would do if a no-confidence motion in the cabinet were  introduced, he avoided giving an answer, saying: "I have had no  time to think about such a thing."    Takemura indicated that a joint floor group formed with  "Group Seiun" which is made up of defectors from the Japan New  Party will be registered with the House of Representatives as  soon as the early May holiday season ends. He also suggested  the possibility of additional defectors from the Japan New Party  joining the joint floor group. Questioned on the much  talked-about idea of Sakigake forming a larger joint floor group  with the SDPJ, he said: "Views within my party have not yet  been finalized," but added: "The SDPJ was a partner at the time  of the Hosokawa government; the two are of a similar position.  We should get closer together." He said his party would  cooperate closely with the SDPJ in the Diet.    Asked about political techniques used by Shinseito and  Komeito, Takemura indirectly criticized Shinseito Secretary  General Ozawa and his people, saying, "They are different from  us in the way they think and act. I am disappointed in various  ways."</p>

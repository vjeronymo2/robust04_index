			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / As they say in Europe: Just another everyday crisis THE MOSCOW papers have had no shortage of material in the past couple of weeks: the shelling of the local White House, in particular, aroused a good deal of interest as was shown by the huge crowd of spectators it attracted. But the city's journalists take these things in their stride. 'Today's Izvestia focuses on developments around the former parliament building,' wrote the Tass news agency in its press review the other day. The word 'former' was, in fact, used even before President Boris Yeltsin's tanks set fire to the building so, plainly, Tass grasped the way things were moving. The relaxed approach of the Russians and their media to supposedly epoch-making events is something that has been noted before in this column. This time, it was shown in the measured partisanship of different papers. Pravda was naturally for the parliamentarians (and got banned as a result), while Nezavisimaya Gazeta on the whole backed the president. But even it thought that the 'blockade of the House of Soviets . . . is disgracing us before the whole world.' However, it was hard to disentangle where this paper - its name means The Independent - really stood but I gained some understanding when it became one of the first to be censored. But I still needed the list of prohibited papers, as they appeared in the official decree, to be certain as to who opposed whom. The pro-Yeltsin Komsomolskaya Pravda adopted an unusual position on the banning of Rossiskaya Gazeta, calling the situation 'immoral.' This, however, was because hundreds of thousands of people had paid their subscriptions to the end of the year and 'now would not want to read the paper' even if they could. Local television took a keen interest in the parliamentary rebellion without allowing excessive disruption of its output. When the main channel, Ostankino, had to break into its Sunday afternoon schedule to announce that a state of emergency had been imposed, it went back to a football match within three minutes. Russia's second city, St Petersburg, reacted calmly - the lead story there last weekend was the 50th anniversary of the lifting of the Nazi siege. Further afield, the Poles were, as usual, steeped in gloom. 'The shadow of the dramatic events in Moscow hangs over Poland,' wrote Zycie Warszawy. 'In this situation, the internal cohesion of Poland as regards unity and the key issues of sovereignty, is gaining significance. All kinds of inter-party squabbling must stop.' If you read the Polish press often enough, you come to see that every big international story conceals a Polish story struggling to get out. For the Czechs, it was the media that had emerged victorious. 'Freedom of speech played the greatest role in the defeat of the parliamentary putsch,' wrote one Prague commentator. It was probably Kafka who pointed out originally that freedom of speech's greatest victories usually occur when the opposition's papers have been closed. Yeltsin's opponents may have expected to find allies abroad in the old mouthpieces of other communist parties. This was not so. The Czech Rude Pravo said Rutskoi and Khasbulatov had over-reached themselves. And, in Paris, L'Humanite was scarcely more helpful when it wrote: 'Russia is on the path of third-worldisation and on the verge of transforming itself into a banana republic. And while these little chieftains struggle among themselves, the Russians slip into poverty.' A further sceptical west European note was struck at the other end of the political sectrum by Handelsblatt. This representative of the German business establishment said the west had to ask itself whether it had supported Yeltsin enough and criticised him enough. This (admittedly somewhat indigestible) collection of comments helps to bring home a number of realities. Russia probably does not feel itself to be on the edge of a cataclysm, and the course of events is not even regarded as extraordinary. Indeed, a nation with Russia's history in the 20th century would be hard put to define 'extraordinary.' We see also that the Poles are far more scared of events in Russia than the Czechs who, these days, are two countries away. Germany is further away still, but inevitably more anxious; there were few signs of enthusiasm for Yeltsin's victory there. Typical French opinion was that nothing would be quite the same again, and that real power resided with the army. By comparison, the British papers seemed rather optimistic. The real contrast, though, remains that between foreign assumptions of the huge importance of the events in Moscow and the restrained vision of the Russians themselves. The financial markets, incidentally, agreed with the Russians. James Morgan is economics correspondent of the BBC World Service.</p>

			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Russia in Crisis: Douglas Hurd to hold talks with US officials British foreign secretary Douglas Hurd will fly to Washington today for talks with US officials expected to cover the problems facing Mr Yeltsin, British officials said yesterday. They said Mr Hurd would also discuss with Mr Christopher the conflict in former Yugoslavia, North Korea's row with the United Nations over its nuclear programme, Iraq, and US-European Community trade disputes. It will be Mr Hurd's first full meeting with Mr Christopher, though both men attended a meeting of Nato foreign ministers in Brussels last month. During his two-day stay he will also meet national security adviser Anthony Lake, deputy defence secretary William Perry and leading members of Congress.</p>

			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / UK Company News: IBM chief in UK moves to take over European side Mr Nick Temple, chief executive of International Business Machine's UK subsidiary since early 1992, has moved up to a key European post. IBM, the largest computer maker, is creating marketing teams in each of the principal geographic areas, North America, Europe, Middle East and Africa and Asia-Pacific. The move is part of its recovery from three years of losses caused by a sharp decline in the cost of computer hardware and a shift by customers away from mainframe computers. Mr Temple, 46, has been appointed general manager for the European finance industry which is regarded as IBM's most important business area. The majority of the world's leading banks and financial institutions use large IBM computers for accounting and customer information. His position as head of IBM (UK) will be taken by Mr Javaid Aziz, 41, formerly general manager of marketing for the UK subsidiary. Mr Aziz has worked closely with Mr Temple over the past two years in restructuring and revitalising IBM (UK) and his promotion was no surprise to the company's senior staff. He was closely identified with 'Galaxy,' a scheme implemented last year through which the UK company was divided into 30 separate businesses, each with its own cost structure and profit and loss responsibilities. Mr Temple's new post is regarded as a promotion, recognising his work in leading IBM (UK) back to growth after two years of heavy losses. He has reduced cost structure, cut away layers of management and reorganised the workforce. Last year he was appointed an IBM vice-president, the first IBM (UK) chief executive to be so rewarded. Mr Temple will take on the role of chairman of IBM (UK) after the retirement of Sir Anthony Cleaver later this month. Mr Aziz, a graduate of Loughborough University, joined IBM as a graduate trainee in 1975. His appointments with the company have included director of quality, Europe, and assistant general manager, European operations. Marketing reorganisation, page 11</p>

			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Qualified stamp of approval for Swiss reforms - Bankers give a cautious welcome to tax changes Do not expect any sudden revitalisation of the Swiss financial centre following the approval given by Swiss voters in a referendum last Sunday to the elimination of stamp duties on some securities transactions. That is the typically cautious message from Swiss bankers who emphasise that there is still much to be done to make Switzerland internationally competitive again in many financial areas. For one thing, the tax changes do not take effect until next April. For another, the hated stamp duties, which the financial community has been fighting for years, still apply to about 80 per cent of securities transactions. 'This is a step in the right direction, but it is only a step,' says Mr Peter Widmer, executive vice-president of Bank Julius Baer in Zurich. Bankers say that they hope it will at least prevent any further exodus of financial business to London and Luxembourg. 'It no longer looks as if a major move of people and facilities will be needed,' Mr Widmer says. However, bankers say the change is not enough to encourage banks to bring back to Switzerland the considerable proportion of business that has already moved. Mr Thierry Lombard, managing partner of Geneva-based private bankers Lombard Odier, says his bank would very much like to bring back about half of the SFr7bn (Dollars 5.6bn) in client funds that it manages in Britain, together with the 35 or so jobs involved. 'But this reform is not sufficient,' he says. The main losses to the Swiss financial centre in recent years - attributed in part to the stamp duties - have been in equity trading and in the establishment of investment trusts. Bankers estimate that between one-fifth and one-quarter of all transactions in Swiss equities are now carried out in London. In a typical month, around 10 per cent of the large international equities market conducted in London comprises deals in Swiss shares. There has also been a rapid build-up of Swiss-controlled investment trusts in Luxembourg, with the total reaching SFr179bn at the end of last year, compared with only SFr34bn in Switzerland. Removal of the 0.9 per cent stamp duty on investment trust certificates should stop the outflow of this business, bankers say, and new investment trusts will probably begin to be established in Switzerland. But repatriation of existing funds will not happen until Swiss law on investment trusts is updated, probably within the next two years. Similarly, the elimination of duties on bankers' dealings for their own account should boost the liquidity of the Swiss equity markets and promote market-making there. However, market-making, especially in the shares of Swiss multinationals, will likely remain very strong in London, not least because stamp duties will continue on all client-related equity transactions in Switzerland. One area of considerable promise arising from the reform is the Swiss money market. Until now, there has not been much of a money market because of the stamp duty on these transactions. In recent years, the central bank has issued notional money market certificates. And Credit Suisse has pioneered in underwriting these book entry issues for corporations and local authorities in lieu of commercial paper. Now a real money market can be established.</p>

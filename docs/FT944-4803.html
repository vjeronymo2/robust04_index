The bank said the loans to Kazakhstan are designed to help it in the transition to a market-based economy. A Dollars 554,000 technical assistance grant comes with the loans. The loans will support the government's stabilisation and structural reform programme by helping bridge an external financing gap to prevent a further decline in output and deterioration of living standards, the bank said.</p>

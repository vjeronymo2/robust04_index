			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Temporary or permanent decertification would be directed toward individuals who repeatedly exhibit disregard for health and safety, and also in instances when a particular single offense is of such a serious nature that temporary or permanent decertification should be pursued. In some cases, a section 110 investigation, resulting in either the assessment of civil penalties against the certified person or the pursuit of criminal proceedings, will occur concurrently with temporary or permanent decertification. However, in particularly egregious cases, the district manager may propose temporary or permanent decertification before any section 110 investigation is completed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In summary, the district manager may choose to issue a warning letter, propose remedial action, or propose temporary or permanent decertification prior to, or concurrent with, action taken as a result of a section 110 investigation within the context of MSHA's current enforcement hierarchy. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, the district manager may use these actions in circumstances where civil penalties under section 110(c) of the Mine Act are not applicable, for example, because the individual in question is not a corporate agent. Decertification action would allow for actions against individuals in such cases that do not currently receive additional enforcement actions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, while MSHA has authority to enter mine property but cannot cite an operator or contractor for refusal to allow the agency's examination of dust sampling equipment that is not located on mine property, the district manager may take action against the responsible certification holders by proposing temporary or permanent decertification when the certification holders have violated the regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MSHA's current policy and procedures for revocation of approval to be a part 48 training instructor allow the instructor to present evidence or witnesses to substantiate his or her position, either through a meeting or written submission to MSHA. The person may appeal adverse actions to the appropriate MSHA administrator. MSHA believes that these same procedures also would be appropriate for those persons who would be subject to decertification under this proposed rule. To ensure equitable and uniform treatment in all decertification actions, the scope of this rulemaking would include all activities for which MSHA issues certifications or qualifications, including the part 48 instructor program. The proposed rule includes additional provisions for the issuance of warning letters and the person's right to a post-decertification hearing before the Department of Labor's Office of Administrative Law Judges. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the proposed rule would address the withdrawal of MSHA's recognition of an individual's State certification when circumstances warrant such action. MSHA believes that a single rule will afford the same level of due process for all proposed temporary and permanent decertifications. Because MSHA recognizes many State certification programs, cooperation between MSHA and State mining agencies is crucial to the success of any decertification program. Federal and State mine safety and health programs are more effective when the two government bodies operate cooperatively. In instances where the State confers upon an individual a certification which is recognized by MSHA, the agency would inform the appropriate State agencies that it has determined that an individual's actions may warrant the temporary or permanent decertification of the State-issued certification. In those States which have procedures to decertify individuals, MSHA would work closely with the State to investigate the matter and provide assistance in determining an appropriate course of action. In those cases where the State concludes that decertification is not appropriate and decides to take only limited action or no further action, but MSHA continues to believe stringent action is necessary, MSHA may decide to use the procedures outlined in this proposed rule to terminate MSHA's recognition of the individual's State certification for purposes of compliance with Federal regulations. MSHA would therefore retain the right to suspend or terminate its recognition of a person's State certification even if the State has chosen not to pursue temporary or permanent decertification. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 42.2&blank;Definitions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following definitions would apply in this part: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Administrator. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Administrator would mean MSHA's Administrator for Coal Mine Safety and Health or Administrator for Metal and Nonmetal Mine Safety and Health, as appropriate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Certified. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Certified would mean certified, qualified, or approved by MSHA, either directly or through a State program recognized by MSHA, to perform tasks or duties for which this chapter requires such specific authority. Similarly, certification would mean certification, qualification, or approval. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Decertify. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Decertify would mean to temporarily or permanently revoke a person's certification, qualification, or approval. If MSHA recognizes a person's certification by a State, then decertify would mean that MSHA would no longer recognize that person's State certification for purposes of compliance with this chapter. Decertification would mean temporary or permanent revocation of a person's certification, qualification, or approval. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 42.3&blank;Warning Letter <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed &sect;42.3 would provide that when the evidence indicates that a certified person has failed to follow the tasks set by this chapter, or the person no longer satisfies the requirements for retention of certification, or a certified person's conduct leads to or contributes to a violation of any training, safety or health standard, the district manager may send a warning letter to that person by certified mail, return receipt requested. This section would provide that the district manager may notify the certified person through the warning letter that his or her conduct has been deficient without requiring any further action, or may require remedial measures to be undertaken by the certified person. In short, the warning letter must specify the basis for the warning. In some instances, MSHA may choose to forego the issuance of a warning letter and move directly to issue a notice of proposed action under &sect;42.4 of this part. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

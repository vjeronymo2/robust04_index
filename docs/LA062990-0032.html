			<p><P> June 29, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> A MONUMENTAL 'HUMAN CONDITION' RETURNS  </P> <P> Masaki Kobayashi's near-10-hour, three-part "Human Condition" ("Ningen No  Joken") trilogy is one of the monumental achievements in motion-picture  history. It is also one of the most obscure, for the trilogy -- "No Greater  Love," "Road to Eternity" and "A Soldier's Prayer" -- suffered from poor  international distribution upon its completion in 1961. Having regained its  rights to "The Human Condition," the venerable Shochiku Film Co. presented it  at the old Kabuki Theater on Adams at Crenshaw in 1970. Now, 20 years later,  "The Human Condition" returns today to the Little Tokyo Cinemas.  </P> <P> It is stupendous not only as a kind of ultimate indictment of man's inhumanity  to man but is also virtually unique as a massive reminder of a defeated  nation's folly and evil to itself, comparable in scope and impact to Claude  Lanzmann's death camp documentary "Shoah."  </P> <P> "No Greater Love" finds Kobayashi struggling to get a handle on Jumpei  Gomikawa's six-volume best seller, but he ultimately succeeds in launching his  hero on his grim odyssey so that we may perceive the tragedy of an entire  nation through the story of one man. He is a naive pacifist and intellectual  named Kaji (Tatsuya Nakadai) employed at a steel company in Japanese-occupied  Southern Manchuria who inadvertently ends up helping run a concentration camp  and finally fighting on the front lines in a losing battle.  </P> <P> In "Road to Eternity," Kaji, now immersed in brutal basic training, emerges as  a man of strength and compassion whose intelligence and sanity mirrors the  mounting madness all about him. In the concluding "A Soldier's Prayer," Kaji  moves way beyond resolute idealist to resilient soldier and leader to a man  brought to the level of an animal in the struggle for survival before being  transformed into a Christ-like martyr.  </P> <P> One of the world cinema's great anti-war dramas, "The Human Condition" trilogy  is bleak and eloquent, its tendencies toward the melodramatic and didactic  sustained by Kobayashi's depth of passion and breadth of vision, yielding  finally the catharsis of tragedy.

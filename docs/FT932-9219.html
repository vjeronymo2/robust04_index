			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Lex set to sell Arrow stake LEX SERVICE, the motor distribution and leasing company, plans to sell its remaining 17.5 per cent stake in Arrow Electronics of the US. Lex has filed a registration statement with the SEC and the sale is expected shortly. At current market prices, the disposal will raise about Pounds 100m. Lex took the stake in return for selling its North American electronics business to Arrow in 1991. Its original 36 per cent holding has fallen because of share sales and a share issue by Arrow. Under the original agreement, Lex was required to sell its stake once Arrow's shares traded above Dollars 22 (Pounds 14.20) for more than 60 days. Although this requirement was triggered last August, the two sides agreed to defer the sale. Lex's remaining 5.21m shares have a book value of Pounds 37m but at Wednesday's closing price of Dollars 32 3/4 the stake is worth more than Dollars 170m. Lex said the profit on the sale, after tax, would be taken as an exceptional in this year's results. Lex's shares, together with 500,000 shares being issued by Arrow, are being underwritten by Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities.</p>

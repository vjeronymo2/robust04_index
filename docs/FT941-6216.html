			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Algeria reduces oil revenue hopes Algeria has revised down the revenue it expects from its petroleum exports this year to Dollars 8bn from Dollars 9bn, a spokesman for the state-owned Sonatrach agency said yesterday, Reuter reports from Rabat. The estimate is 'based on an average price of Dollars 15 a barrel for Algerian crude. Our forecast of oil revenues for 1994 will be around Dollars 8bn,' the spokesman for Sonatrach's communications department said. Income from petroleum exports, which represents more than 90 per cent of foreign exchange earnings, was estimated at about Dollars 9bn last year but since then oil prices have fallen. Mr Abdelhak Bouhafs, Sonatrach's managing director, said in an interview published by the Algiers daily Liberte last month 'a decline of Dollars 4 a barrel means a loss of Dollars 2bn'. Servicing Algeria's foreign debt of Dollars 25.7bn cost Dollars 9.3bn last year.</p>

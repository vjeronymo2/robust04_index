			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Kohl welcomes Major proposal on German participation in D-Day celebrations Chancellor Helmut Kohl has warmly welcomed a proposal from Britain's prime minister, Mr John Major, to invite high-level German participation next year at 50th anniversary celebrations in London of the end of the Second World War, Our Foreign Staff writes. The British leader's invitation appears to be an attempt to defuse a gathering diplomatic row over British and French reluctance to invite the German chancellor to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Normandy landings. Referring to a possible visit to the UK, he said it could be done in a 'good and dignified manner'.</p>

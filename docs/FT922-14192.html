			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Arts: Moscow City Ballet Moscow City Ballet has returned to these shores for another tour with its versions of Sleeping Beauty and Swan Lake. It would be pleasant to report that, after last year's visit, the company had improved its presentation of Beauty, that most difficult of ballets, but the staging (as I saw it last Friday night) remains pauperishly the same. The setting is gimcrack, the costuming mostly risible where it is not frankly embarrassing in its inadequacies. The King (Fauntleroy XIV) wears a mustard-coloured lurex knickerbocker suit, embellished with touches of Soviet lace, and sports a page-boy wig with tinsel crown-ette. (His coiffure is, though, rivalled by the long golden locks sported by a lurid young gent among the courtiers, industriously impersonating Veronica Lake). Other characters are kitted out in garments that should have been left behind in an Omsk thrift-shop. About the company shoes, I can but report that they must be among the grubbiest and most dispiriting I have ever seen on stage. The coloured programme book - no bargain at Pounds 3  - declares that the aim of Viktor Smirnov-Golovanov, director of the troupe, is 'to teach his young company the original ideas of the great 19th century choreographers'. A pity, then, that the Beauty text is so oddly edited, and that certain emendations (the Prologue's 'finger' variation; the dances for the fairy cavaliers; the hunt scene) should be so undistinguished. Yet, as with last season's appearances when Ludmila Semenyaka was the invited star, there is a reason to watch Moscow City Ballet. The casting of Yury Posokhov (a guest from the Bolshoy) in certain performances is of real importance. We have greatly admired him with his parent company. He shines now like the best of deeds in the naughtiest of worlds. He shows us the Prince as poet. His physique is ideal, harmonious; his style noble; his technique fluent, elegant in placing and pose, generous in scale. The role acquires thereby an inevitability, a natural distinction, that give it immediate and splendid meaning - we understand the later development of the action on the terms of Posokhov's presence. Like Oleg Sokolov, great interpreter of the Prince with the Kirov in the 1960s, he incarnates an idea of aristocratic behaviour that lies at the core of a premier danseur's art. We are aware of blood-lines going back to le Roi Soleil. That Posokhov also suggests something of the Prince's dreaming, visionary nature in the hunt scene, lends an imaginative depth to the reading. His Aurora was the young, beautiful Yevgenia Vorobieva. Her dancing is serenely easy, and her gently absorbed air - she is caught up in the role, and plays it with a bewitching decorum of manner - brings something utterly sincere and touching to the character and to the classic dance. For the rest, Yulia Snegurova was a gracious Lilac fairy; the female corps de ballet worked industriously: they all merit vastly better surroundings for their gifts. Moscow City Ballet on tour: Manchester Opera House until April 11; Sadler's Wells Theatre, April 13-18; Paignton Festival Theatre, April 20-25.</p>

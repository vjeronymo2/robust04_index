			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Retraining palates on the Continent:  A traditional British Rail breakfast served on the Paris to Brussels express INTERCITY, the British Rail flagship, contributed to entente cordiale this week by serving up bacon and black pudding on the Paris to Brussels early-morning express. Bemused Continental travellers have had their croissants and coffee supplemented by BR's 'Great British Breakfast' as part of an InterCity campaign to dispel its reputation for not-so-haute cuisine. In a week-long experiment, eight InterCity executives, chefs and stewardesses are serving a choice of full British breakfasts on the 7.05am express from Paris, and an evening meal on the return. The initial signs are good. Out of 150 customers in three crowded dining cars yesterday, 70 per cent opted for the Great British Breakfast rather than the meagre local alternative. A big majority chose the full works of bacon, sausage, tomatoes, mushrooms, fried potatoes and black pudding, with a few opting for smoked salmon and scrambled eggs. One opted for kippers, but he turned out to be English. Reactions were favourable, although some customers were more intrigued by the activities of the BBC television crew and the half-dozen journalists flown by InterCity from London to witness the historic event, than by the food. One Parisian lawyer said he thoroughly approved of the Great British Breakfast, but wasn't sure he could cope with it every day. On the evening journey there is pheasant pate with Cumberland sauce and a choice of grilled salmon with a lobster butter sauce or noisettes of Welsh lamb with a redcurrant sauce, a dish created and prepared by Mr Brian Challis, InterCity's chef of the year. There is a selection of British cheeses, including ripe Stilton, summer pudding, and an aperitif of sparkling wine from Kent. UK travellers will have the opportunity to enjoy some Continental catering when a team from Wagons Lits offers its menus on BR later this year. There could be further habit-changing swaps if the experiment is successful. Mr Terry Coyle, InterCity's director of on-board services, said: 'InterCity catering is the envy of most European train operators . . . we would not be doing this if we thought it would not be totally successful. French trains have nothing like the Great British Breakfast.'</p>

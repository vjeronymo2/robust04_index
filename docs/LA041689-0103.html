			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> 'FLORIDA SYNDROME' HAUNTS NEWCOMERS LOOKING FOR EDEN  </P> <P> In travel brochures and the songs of Jimmy ("Margaritaville") Buffett, Florida  is a palm-fringed haven from the rat race where ordinary troubles dissolve  under a blazing sun.  </P> <P> But many newcomers are still hunting for paradise among the impersonal sprawl  of shopping plazas and traffic-clogged thoroughfares.  </P> <P> "I came here with stars in my eyes," says Francis Greene, a 28-year-old  construction equipment salesman who relocated from Philadelphia in September.  "I ended up with an ulcer in my stomach."  </P> <P> In a state of "transplants" -- 780 a day by census estimates -- Greene is one  of the many rejections, say psychological experts and counselors.  </P> <P> Recently, more attention is being paid to the malaise that can beset Florida  newcomers.  </P> <P> Experts say working families are confronted by demoralizing commutes,  uninviting condominium complexes and the anxiety of random violence in a state  where cash-and-carry gun purchases are still possible.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Isolation, Boredom  </P> <P> Retirees, they say, can face isolation and boredom. Others simply drop out.  </P> <P> "I call it the Florida Syndrome," says Dr. Dean J. Rotondo, director of the  neurological laboratory at Fair Oaks Hospital in Delray Beach, about 45 miles  north of Miami. "It's the reality of Florida versus the fantasy."  </P> <P> Rotondo believes the funk is particularly strong in the 60-mile urban strip  between Miami and West Palm Beach, where a nearly twofold population boom in  the last 20 years has overburdened roads and sent developers to the fringe of  the Everglades in search of land.  </P> <P> Stress-related ailments, such as depression and chronic anxiety, are the most  common manifestations of Florida Syndrome, says Rotondo, a native of New York  City.  </P> <P> "I, like many people, came here thinking that if I had a problem, I would just  go to the beach," he says. "Well, you can only go to the beach so much. When  people come down here and find all the problems they left behind -- and  sometimes they are worse -- what's left is a lot of disillusionment and  irritability."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Stress Amplified  </P> <P> Dr. Joyce Glasser, a psychological counselor in Ft. Lauderdale, says the normal  stress of moving is sometimes amplified in Florida because relatives and  friends are often left behind.  </P> <P> "There's always an adjustment process after a move," says Glasser, who came  from Chicago in 1977. "What we have here are people facing all these new ways  of doing things. It hits some people quite hard."  </P> <P> In Dr. Cesar Benarroche's counseling sessions, some newcomers fret over a lack  of convenient public transportation and the crime reports of a homicide every  6.4 hours. Some are even haunted by the peninsula's flatness and air  conditioners blasting on Christmas Day.  </P> <P> "You have to deal with Florida as it is, not like you imagine it should be,"  says Benarroche, a former Yale University professor.  </P> <P> But accepting the urbanized Florida is particularly difficult for the elderly,  who may have toiled during their careers with visions of an idyllic retirement  in the sun, says Irwin I. Isaacs, a Ft. Lauderdale psychologist.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Aura of Death  </P> <P> Domestic friction and the aura of death greet many retires, he says.  </P> <P> "You have these large retirement villages, and each week there's someone  dying," says Isaacs, who conducts seminars for disenchanted elders in South  Florida. "You just make a new friend and then they are dead. It can be very  disturbing."  </P> <P> Isaacs, who moved to Florida from suburban Nassau County near New York City,  says many retirees in his groups often can't cope with the full-time presence  of a spouse.  </P> <P> "Here's the person you dreamed of spending your life with, and all of a sudden  you say: 'I think I hate them,' " he says.  </P> <P> Still, there are some who find that the warm breezes sweep them right off the  mainstream.  </P> <P> Al Ackerman, 32, came to Miami from Chicago in 1984 seeking to make a stake in  the real estate market.  </P> <P> He now does odd jobs in the Keys and occasionally hops a sailboat to the nearby  Bahamas.  </P> <P> "The only Florida Syndrome I ever had was a hangover from too much rum," he  said one recent afternoon in Key Largo.  </P> <P> He then started to hum a Jimmy Buffett tune.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The administration of Primorsky Territory has  accused commanders of the Pacific Fleet and management of a  local factory of failing to comply with safety standards for  storing nuclear waste. Its statement says that more than 2,000  cubic meters of liquid nuclear waste was kept in fleet and  factory-owned tankers moored in the Bolshoi Kamen bay, most of  them unfit for durable storage.    As a result, radiation levels in the region have risen,  according to findings by an interdepartmental commission of  inquiry. The commission said radiation levels had doubled in  the engine department of a TNT-5 tanker which was written off  two years ago and were several times in excess of background  radiation in the bay itself.    The regional authorities have given the fleet command and  factory management until April 25 to comply with safety  standards for nuclear waste storage. Earlier, the commission had  agreed to the dumping of a load of liquid nuclear waste held in  the TNT-5 tanker into the Sea of Japan.</p>

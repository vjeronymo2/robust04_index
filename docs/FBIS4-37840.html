			<p>BFN     [Text] Gaza City, Gaza Strip, June 25 (AFP) -- Israel and  the PLO will resume talks on Tuesday [28 June] in the occupied  territories, PLO chief negotiator Nabil Sha'th said Saturday.    He said the talks had originally been planned for Monday but  were put back "for technical reasons."    Negotiators would not meet in Egypt, as suggested on  Thursday  by Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, but the talks "will  be in the occupied territories," he said, although the place had  not yet been announced.    Sha'th said he would meet with Dani Rothschild, head of the  Israeli military administration, instead of General Amnon Shahaq  who led the Israeli delegation at previous autonomy talks.    "Shahaq is not any more the head of the Israeli delegation,"  he said, although there was no official army confirmation of the  move.    He said the two delegations would first discuss the agenda  for negotiations.    They would then talk about the release of prisoners,  extending Palestinian self-rule in the Israeli-occupied West  Bank and completing matters which remained unresolved before the  May 4 autonomy accord was signed.    Certain issues such as the exact size of the self-rule  enclave of Jericho were put to one side so the signing ceremony  could go ahead in Cairo, launching autonomy in the West Bank  town and the Gaza Strip.</p>

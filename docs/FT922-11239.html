			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / UK power station 'dirtiest' in Europe DRAX, a coal-fired power station owned by the privatised generator National Power, was yesterday branded as the 'biggest polluter in Europe'. This followed the first publication of government figures on the 20 'dirtiest' power stations in England and Wales. Drax, the Yorkshire power station, tops the list. It emits nearly 270,000 tonnes of sulphur dioxide and nearly 83,000 tonnes of nitrogen oxide - both gases that cause acid rain  - every year according to the figures 'Drax is the biggest polluter in Europe,' claimed Ms Fiona Weir, a campaigner with Friends of the Earth, the environmental lobby group. FoE obtained the list of stations and their emissions from the Department of the Environment. Twelve of the power stations on the list belong to National Power, and eight to PowerGen, the other big generator. Emissions from the power stations should have been placed on a public register under the Environmental Protection Act of 1990, the government's flagship environmental legislation. But so far no stations have been registered under the act because of a bureaucratic wrangle between the generators and the Department of the Environment. National Power said: 'We are spending Pounds 700m on fitting cleaning equipment at Drax, and spending Pounds 1bn on clean gas-fired technology. 'We are also importing low-sulphur coal.' National Power and PowerGen have appealed against some crucial information appearing on the register - which they are entitled to do under the act. The generators said they had no intention of concealing details of emissions from their stations. 'We are very happy for all information to be in the public domain,' said Mr Ed Wallis, chief executive of PowerGen. 'But they asked us for the emissions for a year ahead. A competitor could have analysed them and deduced our fuel strategy, which would have been unfair.' Their appeal, which has gone to the secretary of state, will be settled imminently, the Department said. However, the appeal hearing started last April and Mr Heseltine, the former environment secretary, had not published his decision on the case by the time of this year's general election. Ms Weir said the year delay in coming to a decision in what is regarded as an important test case of environmental legislation was 'scandalous'. FoE is keen for the appeal to be settled, so that it can begin to challenge individual stations' applications under the act. All power stations on the list already meet the standards set by the act, say generators.</p>

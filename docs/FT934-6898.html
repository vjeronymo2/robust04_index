			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Ministers finalise shape of ITV ownership rules The government has decided what it intends to do about the future of the ITV ownership rules, and only the manner of the announcement is now in doubt. It is still unclear whether the heritage department will make an early-morning announcement to the stock exchange, because of the price sensitive nature of the decision, or whether the announcement will be made first to the Commons. Discussions over the mechanics of the long-awaited announcement will probably rule out a statement today with tommorrow or Thursday now most likely. The department declined yesterday to give any indication of the content of the announcement, but all the signs are that it will involve a significant change in the rules, allowing large ITV companies to own two large licences and one small one. An advertising revenue ceiling could also be imposed to limit one company to 25 per cent of all television advertising. Protection for HTV and Scottish from takeover by other large ITV companies is expected to be combined with an insistance that no one company can own both London licences. Meanwhile Mr Michael Grade, chief executive of Channel 4, appealed yesterday to the government to protect competition in the selling of television airtime. Mr Grade said he would be 'very, very concerned' if there were a single television sales point for London or a single sales point selling more than 25 per cent of ITV advertising revenue.</p>

			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Spain's Socialists in funds scandal SPANISH tax inspectors yesterday confirmed reports that the ruling Socialist party had financed itself illegally in the late 1980s by selling phantom consulting services to big business. The revelations come as polls show the Socialists slipping badly with a general election due later this year. Confirmation of illicit financing, after two years of vehement denials by the party leadership, has renewed opposition hopes that corruption will become a decisive issue ahead of the election. The inspectors, provided by the Finance Ministry, said that consulting companies operated by senior party officials had taken receipts of Pta1bn (Pounds 6m) from some of Spain's largest banks and industrial companies between 1987 and 1990. For the past two years, newspapers have been alleging that these companies - including Banco Central, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, Asea Brown Boveri's Spanish subsidiary, Catalana de Gas and the Pryca supermarket chain - paid money to two companies in return for expensive reports on their sectors of business. Hardly any of the companies have since been able to produce reports for which they paid, on occasion, more than Pta100m, some saying they had been lost. The inspectors implied that those reports which had been produced had been hastily cobbled together by the business clients. They said these clients owed about Pta437m in unpaid taxes. The 'consulting' companies involved, Filesa and Time Export, were controlled by Mr Carlos Navarro, the former treasurer of the Socialist parliamentary party, and Mr Josep Maria Sala, administrative secretary of the Catalan Socialist party and a member of the party's national executive. Money taken from business 'clients' was then used to pay socialist election expenses and, to disguise that, they took receipts not from party suppliers but from companies run by Ms Aida Alvarez, the Socialist party's national financial co-ordinator until 1986. The Socialist party said yesterday that it would not try to protect the parliamentary immunity of anyone implicated in the scandal, but it is not clear whether the investigating judge, Mr Marino Barbero, will now begin trial proceedings.</p>

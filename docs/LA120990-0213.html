			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHARACTER TRADEMARKS BY JOHN MENDENHALL (CHRONICLE BOOKS: $14.95).  </P> <P> This delightful anthology of characters used as logos by American businesses  includes both the famous (Speedy Alka-Seltzer, Poppin' Fresh, The Jolly Green  Giant) and the infamous, (the bizarre Chicken Boy who watches over downtown  L.A.). The styles of the various characters suggest the changes in advertising  graphics -- and taste -- that occurred over the decades: The original Aunt  Jemima was an ugly black stereotype, who bears only scant resemblance to the  pretty, lighter-skinned woman on modern packages. A treasure trove for  illustrators and graphic designers. Charles Solomon  </P></p>

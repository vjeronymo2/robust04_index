			<p>920608 FT  08 JUN 92 / OAS talks of Haiti action SEVERAL members of the Organisation of American States are considering military intervention in Haiti, after the failure of diplomatic efforts and an economic embargo to secure the return to office of ousted president Jean-Bertrand Aristide, writes Canute James in Kingston. According to diplomats, several Caribbean and Latin American countries are discussing 'surgical and selective strikes' in Haiti by a multinational force. The intention would be to 'weaken the resolve' of the Haitian military to hold on to power. But President Bush said yesterday he was not yet thinking about using force and hoped sanctions could be made effective.</p>

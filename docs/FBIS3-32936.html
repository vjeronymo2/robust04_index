			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed interview with Ricardo Marquez Flores, head of </F> the National Industries Association (SNI); place and date not  given: "Ways of Creating Jobs in Peru"--first paragraph is EL  COMERCIO introduction]    [Text] The most recent population and housing census, which  was conducted in July, estimates that Peru's population grew by  30 percent over the past 12 years. When we compare this  percentage to the growth of the Gross Domestic Product over the  last five years, which was a negative 28.3 percent, we reach the  conclusion that there is not enough output to feed these new  mouths: there is more poverty, fewer businesses, and  consequently fewer jobs. In this regard, in an interview with EL  COMERCIO the president of the National Industries Association,  Ricardo Marquez Flores, calls for a series of measures to  improve standards for the population by creating jobs and  bettering living conditions. The following is a summary of the  interview:    [EL COMERCIO] Mr. Marquez, how do we create more jobs?    [Marquez] The National Industries Association is working on  proposals to create new jobs in the country. We have seen that  our industrial plants are operating at just slightly over half  their capacity. So, one way to create jobs in Peru is to export  and to continue promoting the programs for one million shoes,  one million jogging suits, and the desks program. This will  unquestionably further the development of microbusiness, which  will create thousands and thousands of jobs, often involving  entire families. Subcontracting is another way to create jobs.    [EL COMERCIO] Have you proposed any ways of cutting costs in  industry?    [Marquez] Studies conducted by the SNI indicate two ways to  cut costs. Techniques of total quality control, timely delivery,  and business re-engineering involve companies proper. In  addition, though, costs can be reduced by reducing the cost of  port operations and others, and this is something that is now  starting to be felt. But when we talk about cutting costs, we  are also talking about fiscal overpayments, antitechnology  taxes, and ways of making tax reimbursements simple, timely, and  transparent.    [EL COMERCIO] Could you tell us about some alternatives to  what you call the antitechnology taxes?    [Marquez] In connection with the minimum income tax, we are  proposing, to the extent that this tax is temporary, a tax  credit equivalent to the difference between the 2 percent tax on  the value of the net assets paid out by companies the year  before and 30 percent of profits that year.    [EL COMERCIO] What would the credit be used for?    [Marquez] The credit would be used to pay the tax in the  current year, and whatever balance there is would go to pay the  income tax or other taxes that furnish revenue to the Treasury.    [EL COMERCIO] As for negotiable credit memorandums, we know  that $360 million has been returned in general sales taxes. Does  this help you in any way?    [Marquez] Although it is true that $360 million in general  sales taxes has been returned this year, the new arrangement of  negotiable credit memorandums would complicate the return of the  tax. In spite of the two changes that have been made, we still  feel that a third is needed to make them viable. It is becoming  harder and harder every day to obtain credit, not only for small  and midsized business but for big business as well. This  mechanism makes financing exports more expensive, because no  exporter buys raw materials for just one month's shipments.    [EL COMERCIO] What proposals have you looked into for this  tax?    [Marquez] We ought to amend the system set up by Article 3  of  Decree Law 25748. We should also extend the life of the system  of documents with cancellation power (Legislative Decree 190)  and make it applicable to the entire export sector. While  continuing to cut costs at the denominator without emphasizing a  higher exchange rate, inasmuch as this would alter the entire  economic program, we believe that the tax credit for the  selective consumers tax on oil purchases ought to be regulated.    [EL COMERCIO] Does the industrial union that you head agree  with the current economic program?    [Marquez] We realize that the economic program has to  maintain the iron discipline of expanding the tax base.    [EL COMERCIO] Have you proposed alternatives for expanding  the tax base?    [Marquez] Individuals should be allowed to deduct from their  income tax the general sales tax they pay when making a  purchase. Businesses can check the invoices and the RUC [Single  Taxpayer Registry]. Lowering the selective consumers tax on  whiskey and cigarettes has raised revenues from $12,000 to  $220,000 a month. Therefore, we think that if the simplified  system is cut from 5 to 2 percent, it would further formalize  the economy. If we review the numbers under this simplified  system, we will see that they are not significant today, because  of the standard system. We ought to go back to the Receipts  Lottery, but with greater incentives to bring more people in.  SUNAT [National Tax Administration Superintendency] has  increased the tax burden from 4.5 to 10 percent of the GDP.  Today we have 9,000 main taxpayers, and there are 852,000  registered in the RUC, but we need to have SUNAT and Customs  conducting investigations and cracking down on smuggling and  undervaluation.    [EL COMERCIO] What is the commercial outlook in 1994 for the  industrial union that you head?    [Marquez] We hope that exports expand by much more than the  4  percent a year that is anticipated. Peru needs to increase its  exports by at least 10 percent a year as of 1994.</p>

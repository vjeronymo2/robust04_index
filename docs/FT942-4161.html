			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Threat of train strike deepens as offer refused The threat of a 24-hour strike by railway signalmen next Wednesday deepened last night after it emerged that their union negotiators had rejected a 5.7 per cent pay offer from Railtrack designed to resolve the conflict. The RMT transport union said the company's proposal was 'not nearly enough' to satisfy the grievances of the signalmen, who are demanding an 11 per cent interim wage increase as a condition for entering into talks with Railtrack over the restructuring of their pay system. Last night Railtrack denied that it had made any offer to the union. The RMT said it had spent three days of 'exhaustive negotiations' this week to try to avert a strike. 'We have made ourselves available to settle the dispute as quickly as possible,' the union added. 'We have just been told that the Railtrack board cannot make their minds up on what to offer staff. They are at sixes and sevens.' Further talks between the two sides are expected on Monday, but the RMT warned last night that this was leaving little time to resolve the signalmen's grievances. Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general secretary, said yesterday: 'The claim has been outstanding for seven years. 'If our members are forced to take strike action on Wednesday the fault lies with Railtrack.' Railtrack said that the board had to be called in from all over Britain and there was no possibility of convening a meeting before Monday.</p>

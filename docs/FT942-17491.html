			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Television (Monday): Get comfortable for The Wrong Trousers Whatever else you do or don't see on television this Easter, watch The Wrong Trousers at 6.00 on BBC2 this evening. It is only a few years since I served on a jury which gave the award for best student film to Nick Park for his animated plasticene characters. His first professional film 'Creature Comforts' won an Oscar, and now The Wrong Trousers has brought home Britain's only Oscar in 1994. This is the story of the inventor Wallace (with the marvellous voice of Peter Sallis) and his dog Gromit, and a splendidly villainous penguin who disguises himself with a rubber glove. If you have seen it before, watch it again. The Young Musician Of The Year moves on to select those who will play in Sunday's concerto final. Today: the piano final (7.20 BBC2). That is followed (8.00) by Portrait Or Bust, in which Alan Bennett returns to the art gallery in his home town of Leeds to look at the pictures and, more important perhaps, the other people looking at the pictures. This is made by the same team which produced Bennett's memorable nostalgic programme 'Dinner At Noon'. It is hard to believe that Harry Enfield and Paul Whitehouse are really going to destroy their most poptabulous creations, the jargon-spouting, foot-tapping disc jockeys David Nice and Mike Smash. Yet we are told that Smashie And Nicey - The End Of An Era really does mark the end of the line (9.55 BBC1). BBC2 provides the first showing on terrestrial television of Ridley Scott's own cut of Blade Runner, the movie which invented the rust-bucket space age (10.20).</p>

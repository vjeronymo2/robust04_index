			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / International Company News: Siemens ahead at halfway but order books weaken NET PROFITS at Siemens, Germany's biggest electrical and electronics group, rose just 2 per cent to DM877m (Dollars 544.7m) in the first half of the current year, the company said in an interim report yesterday. Sales rose 3 per cent to DM37bn, but new orders - an important guide to medium-term prospects - fell 4 per cent to DM41bn. Incoming contracts from German customers, which account for just under 50 per cent of all business, fell 7 per cent, after being 4 per cent down at the end of the first quarter. Export orders, which were 10 per cent lower at the three-month mark, were down 2 per cent in the six months to the end of March. Siemens reported 'above average' orders for semiconductors and other components, and strong business in transportation and automotive systems. However, new contracts for the core telecommunications and power generation divisions were lower than at the same time last year. Most of the sales growth in the period under review was attributed to power and transportation. Yesterday's report made no mention of progress at Siemens-Nixdorf, SNI, the computer subsidiary which last year lost DM513m on sales of DM13bn. However, the company denied a report that SNI was heading for a DM1bn loss this year. Siemens referred to a statement last month which said SNI might even show a slight improvement, depending on economic conditions. But this seems increasingly unlikely in the light of worsening economic conditions in Germany and the lack of growth in overseas markets. While the company said half-year sales matched its 'modest expectations for the full year', it offered no further profits forecasts. Mr Heinrich von Pierer, chief executive, said last month that it would be difficult for the group to equal last year's DM1.96bn.</p>

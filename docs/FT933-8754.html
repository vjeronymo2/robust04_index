			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / International Company News: KLM holds out against pressure on margins KLM Royal Dutch Airlines reported a small increase in net profit for the 1992-93 first quarter in spite of pressure on margins caused by a shift in demand to tourist class seats. The increase, to Fl 40m (Dollars 20.5m) for the April-June period from Fl 38m a year earlier, is due mainly to the fact that KLM no longer carries the losses of its 20 per cent-owned US airline, Northwest, on its books. Another factor was a 14 per cent drop in wages and related costs, due in part to a 'premium holiday' on contributions to the airline's pension fund. Mr Pieter Bouw, chairman, told the annual shareholders' meeting that talks on forming an alliance with SAS, Swissair and Austrian Airlines were continuing. The airlines hoped to sign a memorandum of understanding in September, with a definitive agreement expected before the year-end, he said. In the first quarter, passenger numbers rose but this was offset by the trend away from first class and business seats in favour of cheaper tourist fares. The airline is planning to phase out its first class cabins and to improve the quality of business class instead. Total traffic, measured in ton-kilometres, rose by a healthy 14 per cent, but traffic turnover fell by 3 per cent to Fl 1.8bn. Total turnover was down 4 per cent at Fl 2.1bn, outstripping a 3 per cent decline in total expenses to Fl 1.96bn. Margins were also under pressure from price wars and the strength of the guilder, and operating profit fell to Fl 151m from Fl 182m. But this was compensated for by the narrowing in losses from minority-owned airlines to Fl 7m from Fl 61m, following KLM's decision to write down the value of its Northwest investment to zero last year.</p>

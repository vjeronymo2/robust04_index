			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Financial Times Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (3): Don't let the years slip away - The Tax Deadline 2, Pensions / If you can afford to pay more than the maximum contribution, you may still be able to mop up unused past tax relief AS THE tax year ends, retirement gets another year closer. The self-employed and those employees who do not have access to a company pension scheme have considerable flexibility in maximising tax relief, by making end-of-year pension contributions to a personal pension plan or a retirement annuity contract. In particular, those who were unable to make contributions over the past few years can take advantage of Inland Revenue rules that allow them to mop up unused tax relief. The amount you can pay into your plan will vary according to your age, earnings and whether you have a personal pension, a retirement annuity or a combination of the two. Personal pensions replaced retirement annuities in 1988, but, although the latter are no longer sold, it is still possible to make contributions to an existing contract. If you contract out of the state earnings-related pension scheme (Serps) using an 'appropriate' personal pension, then your Serps rebate is paid in addition to your contribution limits. Contributions are based on 'net relevant earnings' which, for the employed, roughly equate to gross earnings, and for the self-employed are defined as income chargeable under Schedule D (that is, income less capital allowances and other allowable expenses). Personal pension holders are further restricted by the 'earnings cap', which limits the maximum salary on which personal pension contributions can be based to Pounds 75,000 for the 1992-93 tax year. This means that a young employee up to age 35 can pay a maximum personal pension contribution of Pounds 13,125, while someone aged 62 can pay up to Pounds 30,000. The earnings cap does not apply to contributions paid solely to retirement annuities, although maximum contribution limits are lower under these contracts than on personal pensions. If you want to pay contributions to both types of plan, then the personal pension limits apply across the board but you immediately become subject to the earnings cap. Specialist help is needed if you are a high earner and want to find out which plan you should pay into for the current tax year. Gerry Hart, managing director of tax consultants RBA Associates, said that if your earnings exceed the following figures you can put more into a retirement annuity for 1992/93 than into a personal pension:  ------------------------------------ Age at April 6 1992        Earnings  ------------------------------------ Under 36              Pounds 75,000 36-45                        85,714 46-50                       107,142 51-55                       112,550 56-60                       116,667 61-74                       109,090  ------------------------------------ Employees with personal pensions pay contributions net of basic rate tax, and must claim higher-rate tax relief, where applicable, through their tax return. Employees with a retirement annuity and the self-employed with either contract, pay contributions gross and claim tax relief through their annual return. Most pensions advisers reckon the best way to structure contributions is through single premium payments. This is because the amount deducted from your contribution to cover the provider's management charges and the intermediary's commission is far less on a single premium than on a regular monthly or annual premium arrangement. This same advice applies to employees who want to top up their company pensions through a free-standing additional voluntary contribution. Provident Life and Professional Life offer non-commission plans, while unit trust personal pensions, available from Gartmore, Rothschild Asset Management and Fidelity, pay commission at about 4 per cent. It is also possible to have all or part of the commission on a standard life-office plan reinvested in your fund, but this must be handled by an adviser and naturally you will pay a fee in lieu of the commission given up. MOPPING UP UNUSED RELIEF If you have sufficient capital to pay more than the permitted maximum contribution for the current year, then you can make use of the Inland Revenue 'carry-back and carry-forward' provisions to mop up unused tax relief in previous years. Professional advice should always be sought, because the rules governing these provisions are complex, particularly where you have a combination of personal pension and retirement annuities. Under the carry-forward provisions, if you had self-employed or non-pensionable earnings in any of the previous six years and did not use up the full contribution limit at the time, you can make use of that tax relief now. To calculate unused relief, simply deduct contributions paid from maximum permissible contributions in relation to net relevant earnings for each tax year. Susan Smith, assistant product manager at Scottish Provident, said: 'There are three important points here: First, maximum contributions must have been paid in the current tax year before any carry-forward exercise can be used. Second, you must work through each previous tax year in order, starting with year six and working forward to the present. Third, in the year of assessment, the contribution you want to pay must not exceed your net relevant earnings for that year.' Employers are not permitted to contribute to the 'mop up' exercise - they can only contribute towards the current tax year's limits. Carry-back provisions allow you to make an election for your contribution to be treated as though it had been paid in the previous tax year. If you had no earnings in the previous tax year, you may be able to carry the contribution back to the year before that. Unlike the carry-forward provisions, if you use carry-back, you do not have to make the maximum contribution in the current tax year first. Carry-back is particularly useful for those whose earnings fluctuate from year to year. Authors and actors are classic examples, but many self-employed people have this problem. If your earnings last year took you into the 40 per cent tax bracket, but this year you are only liable to basic-rate tax, through the use of carry-back you can treat your next contribution as though it were paid in 1991-92 and claim the full 40 per cent tax relief. A request for contributions to be carried back must be made within three months of the end of the current tax year to carry back to the 1992-93 tax year. Finally, a combination of the carry-back/carry-forward provisions can be used to mop up tax relief for up to seven years. The timing of payments under this arrangement is critical, and should only be attempted through a pensions and tax expert.</p>

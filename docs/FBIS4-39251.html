			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mikhail Ovcharov: "President's Representative </F> Demands 131 Million Rubles From Two Papers"]    [Text] Kostroma -- Yuriy Litvinov, the Russian Federation  president's representative in Kostroma Oblast, has  simultaneously sued two newspapers -- KOSTROMSKOY KRAY and  KOSTROMSKIYE VEDOMOSTI for defamation, demanding 131,516 rubles  in compensation for psychological damage.    Some months ago pieces were published first im KOSTROMSKOY  KRAY and then in KOSTROMSKIYE VEDOMOSTI which Yuriy Litvinov  regards as spurious. In particular, his former assistant  Valeriy Deryugin, in an interview with a KOSTROMSKOY KRAY  correspondent, claimed that Yuriy Litvinov had violated the  president's edict on the fight against corruption by enabling  commercial structures to make extensive use of equipment and  communications facilities in the representation's offices. Both  papers also said that the president's representative in Kostroma  Oblast had allegedly used military equipment in the shape of an  infantry fighting vehicle to go hunting in Buyskiy Rayon.    The president's representative strongly denies these and  other charges.</p>

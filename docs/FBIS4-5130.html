			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta -- A consortium of 65 major banks has  agreed to extend a standby loan of around U.S. $500 million to  Bank Indonesia (Central Bank).    The agreement on the loan syndication was signed Monday at  the headquarters of Dresdner Bank in Frankfurt, the Central Bank  announced here Monday.    Paul Sutopo, the managing director of Bank Indonesia, said  that the large number of participants in the loan syndication  reflected the confidence of the international banking community  in Indonesia.    He said that the bank had originally planned to raise only  $400 million from the loan syndicate, but the syndication was  oversubscribed to reach $500 million due to the larger-than  expected response.    "The number of banks in the loan syndication is the highest  so far. We initially anticipated only around 40 participants,"  he said.    The Central Banks press statement said members of the loan  syndication, which was arranged by Chase Manhattan Asia Ltd.,  the Industrial Bank of Japan, Banque National de Paris, Bank of  Tokyo, the Long-Term Credit Bank (LTCB), and Dresdner, included  Asian banks such as Bank Bumiputera of Malaysia.    It said that the loan will mature in seven years and that  the  interest will be paid annually. In the first two years, the  interest rate will be a 5 [as published] of a percent above the  London Inter-bank Offered Rate, and 7/8 [as published] above  thereafter.    The money is intended for use as standby reserves and will  be  drawn only when needed. Disbursement of the loan will be based  on five days of prior notice.    The Indonesian Government annually seeks standby loans  outside its creditor group -- the Consultative Group on  Indonesia -- to maintain its contingency foreign exchange  reserves minimally at $2 billion.    The standby loans, besides serving as contingency reserves  in  addition to the foreign and gold reserves held by Bank Indonesia  to safeguard the balance of payments, usually are also used for  counterpart financing for government projects funded with export  credits.</p>

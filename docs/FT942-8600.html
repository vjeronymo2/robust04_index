			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / International Capital Markets: DTB expected to join Globex system The DTB, Germany's financial futures exchange, is expected to make a statement today on whether it intends to join Globex, the electronic futures trading system developed and operated by Reuters, the financial information and news group. The DTB board met yesterday. Discussions between the DTB and Globex have been described as 'promising' and observers say it is likely that the DTB will join Globex, especially now that Liffe, London's financial futures and options exchange, has decided against joining the system. With Liffe out of the way, the DTB would enjoy an exclusive listing on Globex for its German government bond futures contract. Competition between the two exchanges for volume in this contract is fierce. To date, Liffe has the upper hand with around 70 per cent of the market. However, the DTB may see Globex as a way of increasing its market share by making its contract more accessible to international investors. Earlier this week, Mr Nick Durlacher, Liffe chairman, said the bond contract was unlikely to trade in meaningful volume outside European hours due to the lack of a developed cash market in bunds in east Asia. He noted that the US T-Bond futures contract, the most likely to succeed on an international scale, had failed to attract much volume on Globex. The DTB's close links with Matif, the French futures exchange whose contracts make up around 80 per cent of Globex volume, may also encourage the German exchange to join.</p>

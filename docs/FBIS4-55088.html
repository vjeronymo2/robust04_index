			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 9 May (TANJUG) -- The Serb National  Renewal Party [SNO] organized a rally in Belgrade's Republic  Square. Among others the gathering was addressed by Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy, president of the Liberal Democratic Party of  Russia [LDPR]. SNO representatives pointed out that the meeting  was organized to mark the 49th anniversary of the victory  against fascism and as a harbinger of the upcoming Serbian  victory.    Addressing the rally, Zhirinovskiy said that Russia would  get  a new government and a new president soon. "The day after we  will renew all our relations with Yugoslavia and Serbia, sending  you all necessary aid, including military aid," Zhirinovskiy  said.    According to him, a new holiday will be marked soon -- "the  day when the last foreign soldier left the Balkans, the day when  sanctions against Yugoslavia are suspended." Zhirinovskiy said  that if representatives of the Serbian nation ask the Russian  Parliament for aid, "hundreds of thousands of Russian soldiers  would soon arrive in the Balkans."    Expressing his opinion that the conflict in the Balkans  could  escalate, Zhirinovskiy said that "If NATO and the Muslim world  begin a third world war" the Slavs would celebrate 9 May in the  future "in all Western cities," while all capitals of NATO  members "would be dealt with in the same way as with Berlin in  1945."    He pointed out that the Russians do not have to fight. "We  will just let our defective nuclear submarines sail toward the  West and that will be the end of Western Europe," Zhirinovskiy  said.</p>

			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / The Cabinet Reshuffle: Howard is gift to grassroots MR MICHAEL Howard is a home secretary to hearten Tory grassroots supporters, at a time when they feel under siege on what should be the party's strongest ground. Their only reservation about the combative, articulate right-winger - who favours capital punishment - is likely to be that he is a clever lawyer. For Mr Howard the Home Office is a consolation prize for not becoming chancellor, but still a promotion to responsibilities in which he has long expressed an interest, when the government is seeking to regain the initiative on law and order. His ability to take on the opposition will be highly prized by Tories dismayed by Labour's effective 'tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime' campaign earlier this year. His emphasis on Labour's employment policies in the approach to last year's election revealed him as a formidable if not a sympathetic campaigner. Against Mr Tony Blair, once more his opposite number, he highlighted the opposition's union links and the number of jobs at risk from the social charter and minimum wage. The main political charge laid against Mr Howard is that he lacks passion and conviction, instead arguing whatever brief he has been given - like the experienced QC he is. His supporters indignantly deny this, saying he is the most Euro-sceptic minister in the cabinet and a strong believer in free enterprise and low taxation. An aide said: 'Were it not for some of Thatcher's recent outbursts, I'm sure he would be pleased to call himself a Thatcherite.' He entered the Commons for the relatively safe seat of Folkestone and Hythe in 1983, several years after his 'Cambridge mafia' contemporaries  - Mr Norman Lamont, Mr John Gummer and Mr Kenneth Clarke. In the years before his election, after fighting the safe Labour seat of Liverpool Edge Hill in 1966 and 1970, he turned to developing a successful legal practice specialising in planning and employment cases. Mr Howard made up for lost time within two years of becoming an MP. He became a junior minister at the Department of Trade and Industry, responsible for taking the complicated and technical financial services legislation through the Commons. His reward was promotion to the Department of the Environment after the 1987 election. He presided over the passage of the poll tax legislation; privatised the water industry; and then became employment secretary as unemployment started to rise. His advisers suggest that he will want to build a close and co-operative relationship with the police. A tough crime policy and a more satisfied police service would leave the Tory party in the country well-pleased with Mr Howard's appointment.</p>

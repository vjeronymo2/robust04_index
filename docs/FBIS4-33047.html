			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Union Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] The National Committee of the Social Christian Party  [COPEI] today analyzed the cabinet changes made over the weekend  by President Rafael Caldera. The COPEI leadership believes the  country's problems will not be solved with simple cabinet  changes.    The National Committee's conclusion was announced by Acting  Deputy Secretary General Freddy Delgado Dalo who said that it is  necessary to establish a coherent policy.    [Begin Delgado recording] The National Committee believes  that simple cabinet changes, in this case by rooking [enroque],  will not solve the country's problems. The country is demanding  the definition of policies and coherence in government policies,  not the substitution of some men for others. [end recording]    Meanwhile, Segundo Melendez, leader of the Movement Toward  Socialism [MAS], said that these changes are appropriate.    [Begin Melendez recording] As you know, we expressed our  views on this last week. The decision made by the president is  aimed at something we believe to be essential, and that is the  need to create coherence and unity in the economic cabinet. This  is very important for conducting the overall economic policy.  [end recording]    Democratic Action Party leader Pedro Tabata Guzman has said  that it is necessary to see how effective these changes really  were.    [Begin Tabata recording] With this rooking move made by the  president, all he did was create expectations. For some time now  we have been saying that there was much incoherence among those  who formed President Caldera's economic cabinet. I believe we  must now wait to see if things change. [end recording]    Meanwhile, the Radical Cause Party believes that the changes  have been appropriate. This was announced by party leader Pablo  Medina.    [Begin Medina recording] Some appointments seem to be  appropriate. We believe that naming Pompeyo Marquez as head of  the government's social programs is quite appropriate. Also  appropriate is the appointment of Ciro Zaa as transportation and  communications minister since the former minister's actions had  been questioned by former Deputy Minister Rafael Iribarren.  However, in general terms, we do believe the bankers have  greater control of this cabinet. The fact that Julio Sosa  remains as finance minister, that Carlos Bernardez was appointed  president of the Venezuelan Investment Fund, and that Gustavo  Roosen remains in an overly privileged position, indicates that  the country's bankers have made progress in controlling the  cabinet. Despite this, some of the changes made do seem  appropriate. [end recording]    However, National Convergence believes that the growing  number of bankers in the cabinet has a clear purpose. This was  said by National Convergence Deputy Jose Miguel Uzcategui.    [Begin Uzcategui recording] There is a financial crisis, and  the least that can be done is to reinforce the financial sector.  If there is need to create an environment of trust in our  economy and the future of our currency, then appointing  experienced men, successful men--these men have not failed in  their profession--is positive. Therefore, I do believe it is a  positive move to create this image of credibility. All of them  have been involved in banking activities with substantial and  excellent banks. [end recording]</p>

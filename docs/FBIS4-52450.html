			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "U.S. Must Clear Up Slip-up on Burma'] </F>   [Text] The call by a senior American policy-maker for  increased U.S. ties with Burma needs to be quickly dismissed  before it is mistaken for an actual Washington plan. State  Department Counselor Tim Wirth's proposal to reverse U.S. action  and widen contacts with Rangoon is badly misguided. His senior  rank among U.S. officials lends unwarranted emphasis to his call  for a new American policy on Burma. U.S. direction on Asian  relations has recently come under internal fire from major  Clinton administration officials. Mr Wirth's sudden and  confusing recommendation for reversal of a stable Burma policy  needs to be quickly clarified.    Mr Wirth is a former U.S. senator, with acknowledged  expertise on narcotics matters. In an interview with the REUTER  news agency last week, he recommended "more dialogue" between  Washington and the Rangoon junta. Without providing details, Mr  Wirth said such contact would reduce a huge outflow of heroin to  the United States and other countries. He recommended ignoring  the continuing and massive repression of Burmese in favor of his  emphasis on the drugs problem. "I'm thinking of young people on  the streets of the United States of America who are directly  impacted by that," he told his interviewer. "That should be our  priority."    Not even our own government's policy of "constructive  engagement" is as cynical as Mr Wirth's proposal. The U.S.  official's proposal would completely overlook the massive and  violent abuses of Burmese citizens; At least the Thai -- and  ASEAN -- approaches to Rangoon aim at reversing repression by  the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC). Mr Wirth,  as a former politician, may feel he still must serve an  exclusively American population. The only satisfaction we can  draw is from a fellow official in the State Department who said  Mr Wirth's proposal was "unlikely to be met with much  enthusiasm."    Available evidence shows SLORC has neither the desire nor  the  ability to launch an effective anti-narcotics program. SLORC  leader Lt Gen Khin Nyunt claimed last January his regime would  move against narcotics peddling. The reality has been the  opposite. An alleged military attack on warlord Khun Sa  evaporated two months ago without a single gain. Opium growing  and heroin refining continues to grow in northern Burma. SLORC  has shown no commitment to combat such growth. In addition,  troubling reports of direct links between narcotics dealers and  SLORC officials continue unabated.    The proposal to put Rangoon and Washington on an equal  diplomatic footing is misguided. Since it took power in 1988  over the bodies of thousands of dead citizens, SLORC has shown  few signs of compassion. For five years, it has kept its  best-known and most peaceful citizen imprisoned at home. Aung  San Suu Kyi said in a recent interview she remains determined to  continue her struggle for a democratic Burma. The world's only  superpower should do no less.    There may be no absolutes in diplomatic affairs. But the  lack of goodwill from SLORC is clear. Mr Wirth's proposal to  give status to the Rangoon junta in the mere hope it might  respond is misguided. SLORC has had many years and opportunities  to improve its image through direct action. Instead, it has  continued one of the most repressive systems of governments of  our day. There are several opinions and policies about how to  change this. Mr Wirth's proposal merely to overlook them and to  have faith that heroin exports will decline is a major act of  faith. Beside this, the Thai government's hope that a slow  increase in economic and diplomatic relations will encourage an  easing of SLORC's tyranny seems like a paragon.    The chief U.S. policy-maker for Asian affairs, Winston Lord,  complained last week that U.S.-Asian relations have been sliding  for the past six months. The confusing statement from Mr Wirth  tends to back up this claim. United States policy towards Burma  has been clear, and firm, since 1988. Indeed, Mr Lord himself  said a week ago that Washington intended to continue to disagree  with ASEAN on the matter. "The United States wants Burma  isolated while ASEAN is pursuing a policy of engagement," he  said. If Washington is going to change this policy, it owes its  allies a clear warning. If, as it should, the U.S. intends to  continue to press SLORC for change, it must make this clear. Mr  Wirth's statement has caused confusion. The Clinton  administration should clear it up quickly.</p>

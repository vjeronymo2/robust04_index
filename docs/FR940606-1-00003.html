This proposal would require a one-time dye penetrant inspection to detect cracking in certain hinge pins of the nose landing gear (NLG), and replacement of cracked pins with crack-free pins. This proposal is prompted by reports of cracking of certain hinge pins in the NLG. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent collapse of the NLG due to cracking of the hinge pins. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received by July 18, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;43&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.

The DGAC advises that cracking has been found on the hinge pins during routine overhaul of the nose landing gear (NLG) on Model ATR42&hyph;200 and -300 series airplanes. The cause for this cracking has been attributed to improper heat treatment during manufacture of the hinge pins. The defective pins have been isolated to those manufactured by Nardi having part number D56867 and serial numbers beginning with the letter ``N.'' This condition, if not corrected, could result in collapse of the NLG due to cracking of the hinge pins.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Avions de Transport Regional has issued Service Bulletin ATR42&hyph;32&hyph;0064, dated January 17, 1994, that describes procedures for a one-time dye penetrant inspection to detect cracking in certain hinge pins of the NLG, and replacement of cracked pins with crack-free pins. The DGAC classified this service bulletin as mandatory and issued French Airworthiness Directive 94&hyph;005&hyph;055(B), dated January 5, 1994, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in France.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This airplane model is manufactured in France and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the DGAC has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the DGAC, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require a one-time dye penetrant inspection to detect cracking in certain hinge pins in the NLG, and replacement of cracked pins with crack-free pins. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Michel Rocard, Socialist Party secretary </F> general, by Paul Guilbert and Joseph Mace-Scaron; place and date  not given: "Rocard: `The Only Recovery We See Is the Right  Recovering the Positions of Power'"]    [Text] After the Conference on Social Transformation and  the electoral "shudder" at the recent cantonal elections, the  leader of the PS [Socialist Party] passes judgment on the action  of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur. In an interview with LE  FIGARO, the Mayor of Conflans shows that the Socialists have had  no problems in adjusting from a government to an opposition  frame of mind.    [LE FIGARO] Edouard Balladur stressed, in his appearance on  "L'Heure de Verite" ["Hour of Truth" TV show] that no other  policy was possible. Do you share that opinion?    [Rocard] There is an implicit hypothesis behind that  statement: Namely, that general economic policy is limited to a  monetarist policy. This is a postulate that I refute  categorically.    [LE FIGARO] How can you run a policy to fight unemployment  when you can only act "on the fringes"?    [Rocard] I would firstly say that the phenomenon of  unemployment in France is currently taking on a new aspect. The  number of long-term unemployed has passed the million mark while  the rate of youth unemployment has reached a worrying level.  When you consider that drugs and criminality are highly  dependent on unemployment, how can we accept this linear growth  without changing anything? The most serious threat hanging over  us today is not bankruptcy but social disintegration. First,  the room for action does exist, even if it is minimal, and it  can be increased. Second, there are other things to take into  consideration, aside from the room for maneuver. We can also  work at the heart of the problems, for example, by considering  the idea of a rapid New Deal to find the path to strong growth  on the European level.    [LE FIGARO] Is that not a new utopia?    [Rocard] On the contrary, it is very realistic. Technically,  Europe has a great potential for growth. The crisis has  weakened all local and regional authorities, it is true, and  countries. The European Union has escaped this torment. It is  not in debt and has the best profile in the world, since it is  underwritten by 340 million economically-powerful consumers.  Politically, my friends in social democratic parties, several  of whom are already in power and others on the verge of  government, increasingly share the idea of an enormous European  loan to finance the major projects which will lay the road to  the future, create immediate employment, and stimulate activity.    [LE FIGARO] Outside of Europe, then, there is no salvation?    [Rocard] On the contrary. In France itself many things are  possible. For example, the creation of jobs in the services  sector.    Vast numbers of essential needs can be covered: nursery  education, treatment for the elderly and handicapped,  environmental tasks, cultural activities, etc. To create and  finance these jobs, we need a philosophy close to that of the  employment-solidarity contracts (CES) that I created, which  implies the true, active involvement of all bodies whose sole  action today consists in paying out benefits. It will also  require the state's determination to grant certain exemptions.  There are a number of paths we can go down, but you can always  say that there is no other policy possible when you do not  invent anything.    [LE FIGARO] Do you not think that the five-year employment  law is nonetheless the beginning of a process for the reduction  of working time?    [Rocard] On the contrary. Mr. Jean-Yves Charnard, who  poisoned the debate by caricaturing it, and Mr. Balladur, who  opposed it haughtily, have between them slowed the process.  While service jobs represent a considerable source of  employment, the reduction in working time would be another major  contribution.    Mr. Balladur says it is unimaginable for France to go it  alone in the world: I challenge this erroneous reasoning in its  entirety. Firstly, because Germany, the Netherlands, and the  Scandinavian countries have a slightly shorter working week.  Also, because nobody has suggested an authoritarian, blind, and  brutal reduction. Put more simply, everyone knows that if we are  to recapture growth we need to work more. What we need is more  work to be done by more people.    Problems of adjustment are very complex, but the state must  assist by supplying the required finance. Moreover, it must  stimulate activity in two ways: Through the general law which  can provide a framework for future negotiations per sector, and  through its policy toward its own salaried workers -- there is  nothing to stop it from negotiating within administrations and  state-owned companies.    There are many other possibilities that depend just on us.  The Swedes did not wait for other countries before it created  progressive retirement, i.e., the possibility for an employee to  move from full-time to two-thirds time to one-third time. He  keeps one-third or two-thirds of his salary and receives  one-third or two-thirds of his pension, and that gives better  results.    Another method is applying a surplus tax to overtime in  order  to gradually start social negotiations for its suppression and  replacement by compensatory leave. Then there is the issue of  voluntary part-time work. Since this formula provides  flexibility, is must be negotiated between the company and the  employee. The five-year law does the opposite: It enables the  selected work time to be imposed...by the employer!    Once again, there are many paths we can take. I admit that I  do not understand how a government which has such a comfortable  majority can simply opt to do nothing.    [LE FIGARO] Are your criticisms of Edouard Balladur aimed  more at what he is doing or his method?    [Rocard] They are leveled at what he is doing. What is his  method? All heads of government negotiate to a greater or  lesser extent. For him it is to a lesser extent.    [LE FIGARO] The other side to the prime minister's argument  is the desire not to be too hard on an already fragile society.  Basically, we are not far from the reform by consensus that you  wanted to implement when you were prime minister...    [Rocard] Yes we are. When a consensus is possible, that is  fine, it means that the reforms take deeper root. When it is  not, decisions have to be made. Remember the general social  contribution (CSG) and urban solidarity, and all those other  decisions! I had no comfortable majority.    I should add that the most important reforms are not always  applied through legislation. I am in particular thinking of the  renewal of public service, which I still think is a fundamental  reform. Reform is more difficult when you have no absolute  majority, but Mr. Balladur has 480 deputies behind him, a large  majority in the senate, his friends control 20 of the 22  metropolitan regions, three-quarters of the departments, and  one-half of all urban districts. So what is he waiting for to  reform? We had none of these advantages.    In periods of improving growth, as between 1988 and 1990, it  is harder to reform because people cannot see the need as much:  There is growth, some money, all you need to do is take people  on. In difficult times, it is true, there is the temptation to  turn inwards, but people are much more willing to listen.  However, not once during the "Heure de la Verite" program did  Edouard Balladur give the impression that he had the slightest  idea of what France should be like in five or six years' time,  not once! How can you expect people to make an effort  themselves consisting of accepting reforms when you do not tell  them why?    I cannot accept the parallel between patience and  immobility.  Mr. Balladur either makes hasty decisions -- such as on pensions  and the increase in the CSG -- or no decisions at all, with the  promise of better days being constantly postponed.    [LE FIGARO] Can we not already see the first signs of a  recovery?    [Rocard] The only recovery we can see is a renewed recovery  by the right of the positions of power! Mr. Raymond Barre (UDF  [Union for French Democracy]) was right when he spoke of the  "partial state in disguise." Of course, all governments operate  a policy of appointment -- I did. There are quantitative  problems of speed and numbers; there are qualitative problems  concerning men and women; and there are problems of the  political balance of the new appointments. Everywhere, Mr.  Balladur is methodically weaving his web.    France is not made to be governed by some 30 or so men who,  assured of political power, today control the whole banking  sector, most of insurance and industry, and almost all the  audiovisual sector. The latter area is the most obvious but is  far from being the only one. However, when, on top of that, Mr.  Balladur blandly claims he only heard about the Canal Plus  affair in the press, I would say, to remain polite, that he is  rather overestimating the French people's gullibility...    [LE FIGARO] Is not a prime minister who is candidate to the  presidency of the Republic necessarily inclined to err on the  side of caution?    [Rocard] I would say that the fact of finding yourself as  candidate to the presidency just a few months from the elections  should encourage you to implement reforms and launch yourself  into the future.    [LE FIGARO] In your opinion, then, the fact of being  candidate to the presidency of the Republic is more of a spur.    [Rocard] Yes, a spur to nurture results and, quite simply,  to  do what you have to do, what serves the present and prepares for  the future.    [LE FIGARO] You recently said that it is not the prime  minister who determines policy directions...    [Rocard] This is a formula that respects the attributions of  the president and it appears to me to be profoundly true except,  of course, during a period of cohabitation. As Edouard Balladur  reminded us, it is then the head of government's job to  determine the new policy's direction.    [LE FIGARO] Does the current majority risk, during its term  of office, encountering the same difficulties the Left  encountered?    [Rocard] Of course, but it always claimed that these  difficulties were specific to the Left. It has been proved that  this is not the case. Everything else comes on top of the basic  concern generated by unemployment. Since the right has only  made a political analysis of our electoral defeat, it did not  consider it necessary to reply to this concern.    [LE FIGARO] It appears that, at the beginning, you had some  problem accepting the "Balladur phenomenon?"    [Rocard] It is more in my nature to act than to demolish. I  readily accept that I found it hard to apprehend what you call  the "Balladur phenomenon." Since I do not like personal attacks  and I do not like systematic criticism, I was caught in an  awkward situation. However, Mr. Edouard Balladur determined the  issue himself. It began with the announcement on the same day  of 17,000 public company layoffs. The prime minister -- already  -- said he had not been informed! Then there was Air France,  then the Iranians wrested from the Swiss justice authorities,  then the Falloux law, then the fishing disputes, it all started  then...    [LE FIGARO] What, in your opinion, has been the prime  minister's biggest mistake?    [Rocard] It is not a mistake, but a constant feature...  perhaps of his character. The man who refused to meet with the  fishermen is the same man who, in 1986, abolished the wealth tax.    [LE FIGARO] Do you feel you have time to rebuild the Left  and  prepare its candidate for the presidential election?    [Rocard] Yes. At the time when it took 23 years for a  president to be replaced, you needed 10 years to prepare for the  presidential elections. Now we know it can be done in just 23  months, so draw your own conclusions.    [LE FIGARO] To gather the whole of the Left you need to  adopt  a policy of breaking away. Will you choose to break away from  the past history of the Left or break away from the present of  the Right?    [Rocard] Break away, indeed! I think, on the contrary, that  we must build on an assumed past to offer a vision of the  future. Our party conference established our relations with the  past, successes and failures, and without any complacency. I am  one of the rare political leaders to have published a  self-critical review. We need add nothing more. Now, the "PS  house" is in reasonable order, our meetings go well, the active  party members no longer always react according to events but in  the aim of party progress.    Similarly, we still have four major meetings planned to  follow up on the Conference for Social Transformation. This is  the first time since the beginning of the century that the whole  of the Left is working together and that all sides agreed to  have an open debate. It is with that and on that basis that we  are going to build the project for society that we want to offer  the French people.    [LE FIGARO] Thus, you favor progress based on thematic  affinities rather than renewing alliances?    [Rocard] Yes. Nothing is more solid than shared convictions.  The idea of agreements between party leaderships is an archaic  one. Today's electorate is more changing, rather concerned, and  very widely spread. Its capacity for gathering around a cause  cannot be negotiated among the main political leaders. No one  has a right to society's votes. That being said, aggression is  not the right way to prepare for a second round of voting,  either, as we saw in March 1993.    The word "alliance" does not adequately describe the process  that can occur. As for having an innovative imagination, I  think we will be good enough. However, the main thrust of our  future action consists less of looking for necessarily new ideas  than applying ideas that already exist. An idea remains new for  as long as it is not put into practice. It is true of the  European New Deal, and it is true of the four-day working week.  Having said that, that does not exclude us from coming up with  new suggestions.    [LE FIGARO] Who do you fear more in the second round of the  presidential elections, Edouard Balladur or Jacques Chirac?    [Rocard] I really do not care, since the problem lies  elsewhere. Either we are not capable of a political rebirth and  anyone can beat us, or we are capable and we can beat anyone.</p>

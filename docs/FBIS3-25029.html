(?Following) the statements of Joao de Matos,  chief of General Staff of the Angolan Armed Forces on 2 February  1994, the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola [MPLA]  broke the unilateral cease-fire declared by the National Union  for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] in Cuito that had  been in force for more than four months.    a. Parachutes have been supplying their troops for four  months, and this allowed them to get reorganized.    b. MPLA aircraft were active the whole day on 5 February  1994, coming in waves of two bombers against UNITA lines.    2. Once more the MPLA has deceived the Angolan people and  the international community.    a. The MPLA claims victory in Cuito because it attacked --  it was not defending. Therefore, in less than five hours it  occupied positions held by UNITA Armed Forces in Cuito.    b. All authorizations for the air raids on UNITA lines were  issued in Luanda.    3. UNITA's Political Commission and its General Staff have  been holding a meeting since 1100 [1000 GMT] on 5 February 1994  to assess the situation. It has resolved to:    a. To try to reestablish the cease-fire unilaterally  proclaimed by UNITA on 20 September 1993.    b. To explore possibilities of continuing with negotiations  in Lusaka, taking into account the significant progress already  achieved.    4. UNITA condemns France's invitation to the MPLA chairman  to visit that country to buy weapons in exchange for oil instead  of assisting the United Nations in its efforts to mediate the  talks in Lusaka, because this encourages the MPLA to wage war.  UNITA will once more be ready to face all challenges, the  biggest of all being the universal cease-fire and peace in  Angola.    [Dated] Huambo, 5 February 1994.    [Signed] UNITA's Political Commission.</p>

Churkin told  journalists of this today in Moscow. At the same time, he does  not rule out the possibility of new problems with regard to a  political settlement around Sarajevo. Among these, he  identified the likelihood of terrorist acts.    Vitaliy Churkin believes that the situation whereby  responsibility for the explosion in the Sarajevo market was  immediately laid at the Serbs' door is unacceptable. In his  opinion, in this sort of case it is necessary to hold an  investigation.    The Russian president's special representative denied rumors  about the possible introduction of Russian troops into  Macedonia. He said that this possibility is not being discussed  and is not on the agenda.</p>

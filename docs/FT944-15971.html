			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: UK gilts With the governor adamant that bond markets are too pessimistic about inflation, the Bank of England was unlikely to opt for a long-dated auction this month. Unusually, however, it had the luxury of choice, as gilts continued to draw relative benefit from September's base rate rise. Moreover, after this week's heavy tap sales, the Bank must feel comfortable with its funding programme. Unlike last year it can well afford to forgo an auction in November. But the choice of a short maturity for October's auction leaves one problem unresolved. This year's funding profile is not particularly tilted towards the short end of the yield curve, but the Bank continues to eschew the longest maturities of 25 years despite evident institutional demand. The lack of such paper - the longest-dated conventional gilt matures in 2017 - is a glaring gap in an otherwise richly-endowed market. The bank has yet to find a way of filling it without giving the impression that it has turned pessimistic about the course of rates. The logic of the governor's approach is that rates will eventually fall as investors become more trusting on inflation. But the chances of substantially lower yields look slim in the short run. Worries persist about the US bond market, and gilt spreads over US and German government bonds have narrowed significantly over the past month. At around 100 and 130 basis points respectively, they may not have much further to go.</p>

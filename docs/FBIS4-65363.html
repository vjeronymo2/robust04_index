			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Passages within quotation marks recorded] </F>   [Excerpts] The finance minister [Eduardo Catroga] has said  that it was unclear why Banco Totta sold capital to the Spanish  bank Banesto. This was because Banesto owned, directly or  indirectly, about half of Totta's shares, although the law only  allows 25-percent ownership. The minister admits that the law  was broken, and he is informing the attorney general's office of  this matter. Eduardo Catroga was speaking in Brussels, where he  went to discuss the latest European Commission forecasts for the  Portuguese economy. [passage omitted] Pedro Oliveira reports.    [Oliveira] For Minister Catroga, the recovery of the  Portuguese economy is under way, following in the footsteps of  the rest of the European Union [EU]. The resumption of growth,  budget control, wage moderation, and control of inflation --  Catroga brought to Brussels positive indicators regarding the  Portuguese economy. [passage omitted]    [Catroga] "The recovery of the Portuguese economy has  started. That recovery will be gradual during 1994 -- it is a  long and difficult process that will be consolidated in 1995."    [Oliveira] A 3-percent growth in 1995, with the help of EU  funds, but only 1.1 percent for the current year -- half a point  below the EU's average. Catroga admitted that this objective  would not be reached this year.    [Catroga] "The Portuguese Government's objective --  according  to the macroeconomic scene underlying the state budget for 1994  -- was a growth in gross domestic product of between 1 and 2  percent. The commission's estimate lies in this range. It is  also an objective of the Portuguese Government to obtain an  average growth higher than the average EU growth. This  objective has to be seen on a medium- to long-term basis. It  does not mean though that in a particular year, in our view,  this rule -- which must be valid on a medium- to long-term basis  and which must remain our goal -- it does not mean that there  will be no fluctuation in a particular year. Especially in a  year following a period of recession and enjoying the beginnings  of an economic recovery such as 1994." [passage omitted]</p>

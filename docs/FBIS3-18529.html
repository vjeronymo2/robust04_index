			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Giorgio Battistini, Gianluca Luzi: "Now Think, </F> Italy"]    [Text] Rome -- "There is still a month to go before the  general election, but I see that some people are already forming  governments. I think we should wait and see who wins. We are  committed to victory." There is talk about a "constituent  government" after the elections, and [Democratic Party of the  Left (PDS) Secretary] Achille Occhetto has issued a warning and  a challenge to [Italian Popular Party (PPI) Secretary]  Martinazzoli and [Northern League leader] Bossi, who have been  talking about it: First, the contest must take place, and the  progressives want to win it in order to govern. So Occhetto  wants to win, but victory is also the stated aim of the Pact for  Italy which -- with [Pact leader] Segni, Martinazzoli,  [Socialist] Amato, and [Italian Republican Party, PRI,  Secretary] La Malfa -- instead risks playing the role of the  preordained loser in this confrontation between the Right and  the Left.    They are rivals. They goad each other, try to win over the  same voters, and attack each other. But the real enemy, the  main target of Segni's attacks, and also those of Occhetto and  [Democratic Alliance, AD, leader] Adornato, is [Forza Italia  leader] Silvio Berlusconi, the "Knight of the Antenna," as AD  calls him. Contesting an election for the first time, both the  Pact for Italy and AD (which presented their candidates and  programs at two separate hotels in Rome) concentrated their  attacks on Forza Italia's leader.    Thus Occhetto replied almost contemptuously to Berlusconi's  proposal of another election if no clear majority emerges 28  March: "Berlusconi is young, fresh, and full of life. Now he is  involving himself in politics and therefore wants to have some  fun right after the election so as to be able to broadcast more  commercials." Then Occhetto abandoned his sarcasm: "For some  time the citizens have thought that it is necessary to set to  work, to produce, and to grant this country security. We hope  that these citizens will find the strength to opt clearly for a  majority that is willing to roll up its sleeves in order to  rebuild Italy."    This appeal was expressed in the slogan, "Think, Italy,"  [Ragiona Italia] launched by AD yesterday, to counter  Berlusconi's Forza Italia. "We must work for a thinking Italy  against those who want to induce the sleep of reason which, as  we know, creates monsters." This was said by Luigi Spaventa, a  [budget] minister in the Ciampi government, and Berlusconi's  challenger in central Rome, the symbolic constituency in these  elections.    Seriousness versus demagoguery is the theme that AD and the  progressives have identified as the key to the campaign against  Berlusconi. According to Spaventa, Forza Italia's Right is  exploiting the idea of a "mythical Wild West where men are men  and the land belongs to everyone." The Right's electoral  program is "intellectually and technically coarse," Spaventa  said, as, for instance, in the plan to "create a million jobs by  granting tax relief on reinvested profits" or with regard to the  abolition of road tax. "This means depriving the regions of  revenue," the budget minister stressed. "How does that square  with a federal tax system?"    The Left is telling voters to beware of facile promises.  "They are just promises, electoral demagoguery," Bruno  Visentini said, flanking Spaventa. "The market economy is not a  natural phenomenon but a complex one requiring rules, and it  must therefore be subject to discipline," the former Republican  minister warned. "And a million new jobs cannot result from a  wave of a magic wand." "Demagogic promises" and the request for  "blank checks," Visentini said, "are historically the prelude to  authoritarianism," to a Right "that longs for the return of the  night stick." So according to Visentini, a vote for the Right  entails "a real leap in the dark."    Segni's Pact for Italy also takes issue with the Left, of  course, but its main target remains Berlusconi. What if Forza  Italia promises lower taxes? Those are "rash promises," Segni  said, recalling the warning issued by Governor of the Bank of  Italy Antonio Fazio. "To promise a major reduction in the tax  burden means to forget about the problem of the public debt.  These proposals are simply demagogic and inopportune." The  Pact's pledge, Segni said, is "not to increase taxes. It is  through reducing tax evasion and the public debt that a lowering  of tax rates will be possible." As for a million jobs in three  months -- "not even with a magic wand...."    Rather, the Pact leader said, "it is surprising that Forza  Italia's program says nothing about the media. For our part,  the duopoly in television must be eliminated, though the public  presence must be maintained, albeit cut back in some areas."  Basically, "it is necessary to ensure a greater private  presence through a modification of the Mammi Bill. It is not  possible for all private information to be entrusted to a single  individual."    Martinazzoli, in a mood for witticisms, made a remark about  "promises of miracles," which are always easy during an election  campaign. "Vote for the Right once, take three," he said, with  reference to the cross-party alliance between Bossi, Berlusconi,  and [Italian Social Movement (MSI) leader] Fini. He also spoke  about Bossi's "year of the Samurai," which has become "the month  of delirium." "However," the Italian Popular Party leader said,  "miracles rarely occur in politics, and so ultimately it will be  necessary to sum up all these subtractions and additions -- less  tax, more consumption, more order and money for justice. I hope  that the Italian people will not be prompted to support promises  that then immediately backfire against them." However, the  possibility of a constituent government still remains. "My  idea," he explained, "is that if none of the alignments gains a  majority, it will be necessary to establish not so much just any  kind of government but, rather, a government capable of  governing authoritatively in a period which is still to a large  extent a constituent one."</p>

			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / International Capital Markets: Caribbean region goes for growth Caribbean countries are joining the ranks of the faster growing emerging capital markets. Capitalisation of the region's markets reached Dollars 322m last year, up 41 per cent on 1992, according to the Inter-American Investment Corporation, with the stimulus coming from changes in economic policy in several countries. Countries such as Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, the Dominican Republic and Jamaica have opened their economies, allowing greater participation by local and foreign capital in sectors such as utilities, once considered the sole province of governments. Increased private participation has come with the divestment of state economic enterprises, an increase in the number of traded companies on local stock exchanges and a broadening of ownership which has widened and deepened the exchanges. Many previously highly-geared companies have been restructured, making them more competitive. The sensitive foreign exchange markets have also been deregulated with the removal of exchange controls and the floating of currencies. Financial services companies have used the new climate to introduce a range of securities on domestic markets and to move into the regional and foreign money markets. The growth in the Caribbean reflects a global trend in emerging markets, according to Mr Rudolf van der Bijl of the Capital Markets Department of the IFC. 'In 1982, 32 emerging markets had a market capitalisation of Dollars 67bn,' he said. 'In 1993 it was almost Dollars 1,400bn - a 20-fold increase. This is clearly not a flash in the pan.' The behaviour of emerging markets can be volatile, he reported. In 1992, for example, the Jamaican market recorded growth of 202 per cent, the highest of all the emerging markets. Yet last year the market dropped 50 per cent, largely because of high interest rates. However, the continued growth of the Caribbean markets is being hobbled by infrastructural and institutional shortcomings. 'If the Caribbean countries and companies wish to participate in the international market and reap the benefits of globalisation and internationalisation, they must establish standards and practices consistent with the international market,' Mr van der Bijl advised. These changes include equitable and similar fiscal treatment of income from different types of instruments; investor protection; and a modern legal and regulatory framework, such as a capital market law. An adequate securities commission, compliance with internationally accepted accounting standards and reporting, adequate clearing and settlement standards and procedures, and modern communications are also required. The prospects for further growth appear to be improving, with indications that government officials are aware of what is needed. 'The development of the capital market in some Caribbean countries, such as Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago, is possible with the flotation of public issues, the underwriting of loans, underwriting of privatisation issues, and syndication,' said Mr Paul Chen-Young, executive chairman of the Eagle Group, one of Jamaica's larger financial services conglomerates.</p>

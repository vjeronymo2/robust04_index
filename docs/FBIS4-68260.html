			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Vitaliy Poluyanov by Col. Valeriy Usoltsev, </F> place and date not given: "Changing the Saber for the Sea"]    [Text] The Ussuri Cossacks are going to serve in the  naval infantry with this slogan. Perhaps a first in the  centuries-long history of the Russia Cossacks. "The Cossack  gallops across the valley." But now what: "Over the seas and  waves, now here, tomorrow there?" It is one thing when the  Cossack fights on dry land, but now he attacks from the ocean  depths. Is such a thing possible?    We went with these questions to the military  ataman of the Ussuri Cossack Troop, Vitaliy  Poluyanov.    [Poluyanov] What is so surprising about it? You could put it  like this: "The Cossack doesn't fear the devil or the deep." Or  don't you agree? Well, let that be a joke, but seriously, what  sort of times are these? A time of the highest military  technology. Do you think we fight with saber and pike? Not at  all, today give us Cossacks the infantry fighting vehicle,  tanks, missiles, Kalashnikovs.    But then the Cossack is a special state of martial spirit,  and not a prescription for a specific combat arm.    The naval infantry is the elite. These are real men. And  that's what we Cossacks want to join. We have lived for three  years with the idea of reinforcing the ranks of the naval  infantry. And finally it has come true. Everyone has agreed, it  has been arranged with the military commissariats and with the  naval command. A Cossack company has been created from our  draftees. Although to tell the truth, we were aiming for a  battalion immediately. That didn't work out.    [Usoltsev] What prevented it?    [Poluyanov] We did it ourselves. Our boys. They have to get  more fit, supplement their knowledge. The selection process for  the naval infantry is very strict. But that's as it should be.    But anyway, we will work on our designated bottlenecks, as  they say. We have set the goal of preparing a whole Cossack  battalion of the naval infantry by autumn.    [Usoltsev] Well, how are today's draftees doing, do you have  any information?    [Poluyanov] The most complete. By order of the Council of  the  Cossack association, stanitsa residents travel around  to the subunits where our Cossacks are serving and check on  their deeds and misdemeanors. If there are any, which God  forbid, we reprimand them and hold them to a strict accounting.  But in general everyone is satisfied with our Cossacks, in the  motorized rifle subunits, in the missile subunits, in the Air  Defense Forces, and in the border guards.    [Usoltsev] What are the goals for the future for the Ussuri  Cossacks?    [Poluyanov] Forming a Cossack squadron. It would be nice to  have a Cossack nuclear vessel in the ocean depths too. What are  you smiling at?    The main goal, our task is to train Cossack soldiers,  Cossack  patriots.    That is our sacred task!</p>

			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Overcast with sunny spells - A small weather centre's struggle to sell its services YOU do not have to be anywhere special to forecast the weather. It is universal, it. Weather Watchers Services competes against the Meteorological Office as a seven-day, round-the-clock independent professional weather service from the village of Laurieston in south west Scotland (population 150). Weather Watchers was set up by Roland Chaplain in 1987 and is based in converted outbuildings behind his stone house. On a balmy spring day it still seems too rural to be serious. Through the open windows come the bleatings of sheep on the Galloway hills. But the three forecasters working at computer screens are accessing the same raw data as the Met Office - one displays the European satellite image that Michael Fish will interpret for millions of BBC viewers that night. Weather Watchers has one edge over the opposition. Its forecasters complement their instruments by telephoning a team of 2,000 volunteer watchers across Scotland and the north of England for information on snowfall, temperature and wind direction, enabling them to assemble a precise local weather picture. Yet the company has been slipping and skidding on treacherous commercial ice. Last autumn, it reached its Pounds 20,000 borrowing limit. The bank forced the original company, Weather Watchers Services, into receivership and Chaplain lost Pounds 10,000 as a guarantor for the overdraft. No other buyers came forward so he bought it back for Pounds 4,500, with another Pounds 2,400 for good will, in effect his own name. It now trades as plain Weather Watchers. The network of volunteer watchers survives as a separate charity. Underlying Weather Watchers's problems is what Chaplain describes as the 'un-level playing field' on which it meets the Met Office. 'No small consultancy can afford the cost of the data provided by a monopoly supplier, The Met Office, which is also our main competitor.' Weather Watchers takes much of its data by computer link from the US and Europe. But it is denied access to data from UK government funded radar stations, useful for tracking storms. By law Chaplain cannot even know the deal by which the Scottish Office allows the Met Office access to radar data. Ironically, The Scottish Office also funds Weather Watchers's road forecasts. He says the Met Office's price for a year's radar data was a 'prohibitive' Pounds 40,000. 'The radar is paid for by public money. Why should a competitor get privileged access?' Weather Watchers offers a special service for businesses. Its forecasters supply regular, personal weather analysis by telephone. For a small fee a garden centre, for example, might take the service to determine when to protect tender plants from frost. 'It is about helping people make the right decision in a finely balanced weather situation,' said Chaplain. 'Weather-related losses cost the economy many hundreds of millions. It has taken off in the US, but not yet here.' Chaplain became interested in the weather at school. He took a theology degree in the early 1960s, but never entered the ministry. Instead he built on his first interest and took a course in meteorology. He worked as a forecaster in Birmingham. The he worked as a teacher and ran a centre for studying social and economic trends in Leeds before returning to forecasting in the severe winter of 1981, broadcasting on local radio and TV. He built his first network of volunteer weather watchers in Yorkshire. When a local radio station official moved to the BBC in Scotland, he asked Chaplain to set up a similar network there. Chaplain's big break came in the bad weather of January 1984, when he used the network to forecast the progress of blizzards correctly. That initial high media profile launched the business, at first with BBC support. The BBC soon stopped funding Weather Watchers in the belief that it would become self supporting. Weather Watchers Services was set up in 1987, using Manpower Services Programme labour and grants from local authorities, the Scottish Development Agency and the tourist board. Over five years those grants have totalled Pounds 15,000. In 1990 Chaplain and the other trained forecasters turned the company into a co-operative. The equipment - computers, softwear, modems and faxes - cost Pounds 26,000. The house and premises, valued at around Pounds 60,000, were paid for by Chaplain's mother. Weather Watchers has built a small clientele which includes The Scotsman, The Sunday Tribune in Ireland and several other local newspapers, hotels and highways authorities. A contract with the Scottish Office to monitor certain high level trunk roads, denting the Met Office's near monopoly of road weather forecasting, dates back to BBC days. But progress beyond that has been difficult. An original staff of eight was progressively cut back as the company failed to achieve the level of trade it expected. A Pounds 5,000 marketing study, a condition of the loans, produced no new work. A marketing consultant brought in only one client. Chaplain employs three forecasters and a secretary, but his Pounds 60,000 worth of business is really only enough to support two full-time employees. Last winter Chaplain embarked on his biggest gamble, launching a national 0891 telephone forecast across 18 regions in conjunction with Interactive Media Services, a Leeds-based telephone information specialist, which put up a Pounds 10,000 loan against future revenue. That money is all used up, but Chaplain continues to offer a full service at a cost of Pounds 3,000 a month, subsidising it from his other work, so that any potential sponsors can monitor it. The commitment is huge - 80 hours of work a week. IMS managing director Bill Wilson said: 'It's early days yet, but the response is encouraging.' Chaplain remains optimistic in adversity. A recent 'cold' mail shot to 125 hotels offering customised weather reports yielded 25 replies. In January he lost one prestige customer, Scotland on Sunday, when the Met Office undercut his price, but last month he gained another, the Daily Record, Scotland's biggest selling daily. In the longer term he still sees potential in an applied weather forecasting consultancy service. 'The problem is to get people to see this as an insurance service where they win.'

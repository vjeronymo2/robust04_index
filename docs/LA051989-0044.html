			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PUT IT TO PROPER USE  </P> <P> Just as Gov. George Deukmejian and legislative Democrats were about to begin  their annual slugfest over the budget, $2.5 billion fell out of the sky over  Sacramento. The latest state tax windfall will not automatically solve the  problems inherent in the governor's proposed $48-billion budget for the fiscal  year starting July 1. But there's nothing like $2.5 billion to generate comity  in the Capitol.  </P> <P> The good news is that the Republican governor pledged to work with the  Legislature to allocate the funds to critical state programs, including  California's deteriorating transportation system. The first step Deukmejian  should take is to abandon his penny-wise, pound-foolish approach to balancing  the budget with cuts in programs to help the aged, blind, disabled, the poor  and the sick in California.  </P> <P> Then, he and the lawmakers need to work their way around two voter-passed  initiatives that ordinarily would prevent them from spending the found money on  the state's most urgent needs. The unanticipated tax revenues normally could  not be spent because they would push the budget over the Gann spending limits  adopted by voter initiative in 1979. That restriction is even further  complicated by Proposition 98 of last year. Under the proposition, 40% of the  $2.5 billion would automatically go to education from kindergarten through the  community colleges. The next $600 million also would go to schools, regardless  of the Gann limit. Without changes in Gann, however, some might ultimately have  to be returned to taxpayers rather than used to finance essential public  services.  </P> <P> The Legislature can suspend the Gann limit on a one-time basis. But one key to  a reasonable allocation of the windfall will be negotiations with Bill Honig,  the state superintendent of public instruction and the leading advocate of the  Proposition 98 campaign. Honig already has indicated a willingness to  compromise on a long-term reform of the Gann limit.  </P> <P> Certainly education needs the money. But fairness dictates in this period of  state budget crisis that reasonable amounts also go to prisons, health care,  mental health, aid to the poor and elderly, local government, highway  maintenance and other programs that Deukmejian had attempted to cut.  </P> <P> State officials earlier announced that tax receipts for the current budget year  were running $750 million above previous estimates. On Wednesday, the governor  announced that the collections were running $1.1 billion higher for this fiscal  year and $1.4 billion for the budget year starting July 1. The $1.4 billion  would be just about the amount needed to maintain existing state programs,  providing most of it did not automatically flow into the education fund.  </P> <P> Officials said the tax receipts are higher because the economy has been  stronger than expected. But the administration had also used a conservative  revenue estimate this year because of the volatility of tax receipts in recent  years, caused in part by federal and state tax reform. In 1987, a surplus of  more than $1 billion went back to taxpayers in refunds. Last year, tax receipts  ran more than $1 billion below expectations.  </P> <P> The new windfall presents California leaders with a happy opportunity to  provide the state with a reasonable spending plan in the coming year, if past  partisan differences can be overcome. That should be Sacramento's first  priority. Next is a long-term solution to the budgeting restrictions imposed by  the Gann limit and Proposition 98. And then, the governor and Legislature  should try to iron out the quirks in the state tax system that are producing  this feast-or-famine cycle of tax revenues.  </P></p>

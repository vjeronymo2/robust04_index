			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Major reassures Ulster Protestants over veto Mr John Major moved to regain the initiative in the Northern Ireland peace process by reassuring the Protestant majority last night that they retained a veto over any change in the status of the province. After the weekend disclosure of fresh talks between Mr John Hume, the Social Democratic and Labour party leader, and Mr Gerry Adams of Sinn Fein, Downing Street flatly rejected any possibility that a revived Hume-Adams peace plan could form the basis for a political settlement. The prime minister's office dismissed speculation at the weekend that it might respond to a cessation of violence with an amnesty for IRA and loyalist terrorists. Downing Street said that since there were no 'political prisoners' in Northern Ireland, an amnesty would not arise. It declared that the presence and number of British troops in the province could not be a subject for negotiation. That was coupled with a strong reaffirmation that the government's 'constitutional guarantee' to the people of Northern Ireland meant that the democratic rights of the majority would never be prejudiced. Mr Major's determined move to reassure the Protestant majority - and above all Mr James Molyneaux's Ulster Unionists - followed signs in recent days of growing unease among moderate Unionists over the direction of the peace process. The leak of draft proposals from the Dublin government on its terms for a political settlement risked threatening the Ulster Unionists' acquiescence in Mr Major's negotiations with Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister. Mr Major is relying on the support of the nine Ulster Unionists MPs to get through controversial legislation at Westminster. The prime minister is also aware that without Mr Molyneaux's backing it will be impossible to secure an Ulster settlement. Officials said detailed British proposals for a new accord to replace the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement fell far short of Dublin's call for a significant element of joint responsibility in the administration of the province, although it recognised Dublin's aspiration to a united Ireland. Downing Street said that Mr Major remained determined to press ahead with negotiations to secure a political settlement in close co-operation with Mr Reynolds. The Irish prime minister yesterday offered an upbeat assessment of the possibility of a permanent cessation of violence by the IRA and its loyalist counterparts. Mr Reynolds also distanced himself, though rather more gently than the British government, from the Hume-Adams initiative. However, the differences between the two leaders over the route to a settlement have been reflected in wrangling over the date of the planned Anglo-Irish summit in Dublin next month. Irish officials insisted the date had been set for December 3. But British officials suggested Mr Major thought more time might be needed to decide the framework for a political settlement. Officials said the government would review the number of troops needed in the province if there were a permanent cessation of violence.

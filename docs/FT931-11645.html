			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Miners call strike at Peabody Coal PEABODY COAL, the largest coal producer in the US and a subsidiary of the UK-based conglomerate Hanson, faces a strike by all 7,700 of its miners today after union leaders last night called for industrial action over what it claims are unfair labour practices. Mr Richard Trumka, president of the United Mine Workers of America, said that the strike would initially be limited to Peabody, but could be extended to mines owned by other members of the employers' trade body, the Bituminous Coal Operators Association, if the BCOA continued to refuse to negotiate a wage agreement with the unions. Talks between the unions and employers started on November 6, but the UMWA claims that since then the BCOA has made no serious attempt to reach agreement. Mr Trumka said that Peabody and other BCOA affiliates had 'refused to respond to even the most simple information requests' from the union. The union called for miners to stop work at Peabody from midnight last night, when the 1988 wage agreement expired. Mr B R Brown, the chief negotiator for the BCOA, said last night: 'We were unable to discuss any issues of substance because the United Mine Workers union raised procedural objections and made take-it-or-leave-it demands, refusing to talk unless the BOAC agreed to those demands.' A prolonged strike at Peabody would be extremely damaging for the company, and its parent, Hanson. In 1991 Peabody produced about 92m tons of coal from 71 mines, generating sales of about Dollars 1.7bn. Only Hanson's tobacco interests make more money for the parent group than Peabody, which reported net income of Dollars 263.5m in 1991, 13 per cent of Hanson's total profits.</p>

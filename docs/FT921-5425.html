			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar surges past Y130 mark THE DOLLAR surged through the Y130 barrier yesterday after more good news on the US economy, beginning what some dealers see as a possible prolonged upwards push. It closed at Y130.80, having touched Y130.99, after a climb to Y129.65/69 in New York, and Y130.45/55 in Tokyo. It was less buoyant against the D-mark, but still finished 1 1/2 pfennigs higher at DM1.6555. The rise began after Monday's unexpected increase in the National Association of Purchasing Management index, continued overnight, and was sustained yesterday by more encouraging figures. January's leading indicators showed their biggest increase for six months - up by 0.9 per cent, compared with an expected 0.7 per cent - while new home sales were up 12.9 per cent to their highest level for two years. Dr Mark Austin, economist at HongKong Bank said: 'People are now starting to believe that things are on the turn, and it will probably take a lot to knock the dollar down. 'The market seems prepared to ignore any negative indicators and act strongly on positive ones.' Dollar optimism was dented slightly, however, by a statement by Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, that signs of recovery were 'quite tentative' and that he did not rule out adjusting money growth if they began to falter. The market is also waiting for Friday's payroll figures with some anxiety, although it is increasingly felt that these may also be encouraging. The dollar is now expected to challenge the DM1.6640 level, where it has previously met resistance, and head towards Y132. It may meet resistance at that level, but the Bank of Japan appeared not to have intervened at Y130 yesterday, possibly because it expected heavy sell-orders at Y130, which failed to materialise. Some dealers also believe the BoJ was badly stung the last time it intervened to try to keep the dollar below Y128 and was able only temporarily to halt the advance. The strength of the US currency was reported to have prompted the Bank of Canada to intervene to support the Canadian dollar, which slipped to CDollars 1.1912. It also knocked the D-mark. which fell back slightly in the EMS to only 30 per cent above its central level, against 34 per cent on Monday. It dropped to a six-month low of FFr3.3976 against the French franc, although this was seen to be as a result of D-mark weakness rather than any inherent strength in the franc. Sterling held steady against the D-mark at DM2.8800. It was encouraged slightly by a larger-than-expected rise in the February official reserves of Dollars 181m, showing there had been little need to intervene in sterling's support over the month. But it fell against the dollar, ending at Dollars 1.7400, compared with Dollars 1.7555 on Monday.</p>

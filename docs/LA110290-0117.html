			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BRODERICK SAYS EX-HUSBAND ISOLATED HER FROM CHILDREN  </P> <P> Elisabeth Anne (Betty) Broderick, accused of killing her former husband and his  second wife, testified Thursday she became increasingly frustrated by Daniel  Broderick's attempts to isolate her from their children.  </P> <P> During cross-examination in her double-murder trial, Broderick said that her  ex-husband, an attorney, had installed an answering machine in his home that  she said was used to intercept her calls to the four children.  </P> <P> Her frustration at being unable to speak to the children, she said, drove her  to leave obscene messages whenever she called and got the tape.  </P> <P> "It was Dan putting the machine on to keep me from getting to the kids. That  was intended to harass me," Broderick said.  </P> <P> She said she became particularly agitated when the answering tape was in the  voice of Linda Kolkena, the legal assistant Daniel Broderick later married.  </P> <P> Betty Broderick has pleaded innocent to the Nov. 5, 1989, killings of Daniel  Broderick and Linda Kolkena Broderick. The couple were fatally shot in the  bedroom of their Hillcrest home.  </P> <P> During her third day on the stand, Broderick also testified that after their  separation, Dan Broderick made every effort to stay away from her.  </P> <P> "From the day he walked out, Mr. Broderick didn't want to have any contact with  me," Broderick testified.  </P> <P> When he dropped off their children at her home for visits, Broderick said, he  would call from the car and ask that the children wait on the sidewalk.  </P> <P> She said calls she made in which she threatened Daniel with various legal  actions became her only recourse in the couple's protracted divorce, which  ended a 16-year marriage.  </P> <P> "That was only a little cheap threat that I could throw at him," she said. "I  had no leverage to make Dan settle with me."  </P> <P> On Wednesday, Broderick testified that her husband had physically abused her.  But during a terse cross-examination by Deputy Dist. Atty. Kerry Wells, she  balked when asked to name dates on which Daniel Broderick had hit her.  </P> <P> Wells asked her specifically about her testimony that Daniel Broderick had once  given her a black eye.  </P> <P> "I don't remember," she said. "It wasn't that big a deal."  </P> <P> Wells also asked Betty Broderick about a failed suicide attempt in November,  1983.  </P> <P> Broderick earlier said she had cut her wrists and taken several pills. She said  Thursday that Daniel Broderick, a medical malpractice attorney who also  graduated from medical school, had treated her wounds.  </P> <P> Wells then asked to see Broderick's wrist to see if she had any scars.  </P> <P> After examining her arms, Wells said she didn't see anything. Broderick's  attorney protested Wells' statement, prompting the judge to suggest that  Broderick let the jury see her arms.  </P> <P> The jurors then stood as Broderick displayed her wrists to panel members.  </P> <P> Prosecutors have argued that Broderick killed the couple out of hate and  revenge after a bitter divorce and custody battle.  </P> <P> Broderick's attorney, Jack Earley, however, is trying to portray Daniel  Broderick as a selfish, manipulative, abusive and alcoholic husband who hired  Kolkena, then began having an affair with her while trying to persuade Betty  Broderick that she was crazy and no longer appealing to him.  </P> <P> The couple were divorced in 1986 and battled for the next three years over the  custody of their two young sons, Danny and Rhett, 13 and 10 at the time of the  slayings.  </P></p>

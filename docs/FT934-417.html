			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Finance and the Family: Charity begins at home - Bethan Hutton suggests ways to help those less fortunate than yourself So you bought Oxfam Christmas cards, put money in the carol singers' tin, and are planning to offload all your ghastlier presents onto the local charity shop. But is there still a nagging feeling at the back of your mind  -prompted by yet another viewing of A Christmas Carol - that, in this season of goodwill, you could be doing a little bit more? If your new year resolution is to give a bit more to those less fortunate than yourself, here are a few ways to make it easier (and get the Inland Revenue to chip in as well). There are three tax-efficient ways to give money to charity, depending on how much you want to give and whether you want to make a long term commitment or just a one-off donation. They are payroll giving (also known as give-as-you-earn, or Gaye), gift aid, and covenants. Most large employers operate Gaye schemes. You can give as little as Pounds 5 a month, and the maximum has been increased recently to Pounds 75 a month. You can donate to several different charities and stop at any time you choose. The money is deducted from gross income, which means that those on basic rate tax would pay just Pounds 56.25 net towards a Pounds 75 donation, and higher rate taxpayers Pounds 45. Gift aid is designed for one-off donations. The minimum donation was originally Pounds 600, then Pounds 400, and it was reduced to its present level of Pounds 250 in the March Budget to make it accessible to more people. There is no upper limit, and gifts made in this way are treated as net of basic rate income tax. This means a gift of Pounds 250 actually becomes Pounds 333 in the hands of the charity, and higher rate taxpayers can claim back the 15 per cent difference between basic and top rate tax, so a donation worth Pounds 333 to the charity would only cost a higher rate taxpayer Pounds 200. To ensure that tax can be reclaimed, you must fill out a form, which the charity should be able to supply. Gift aid, however, is not an appropriate scheme for non-taxpayers as the Inland Revenue can ask you for the tax reclaimed by the charity. While covenants are the longest established tax-efficent method of giving to charity, they are the least flexible, too. They are a long term commitment, designed to last at least four years, and you must make payments at fixed intervals. You need to fill in the standard covenant form, provided by most charities, and set up a standing order or some other method of making regular payments. Covenants are treated as net of basic rate tax, so the charity can reclaim an extra 25 per cent from the Revenue, and higher rate taxpayers can reclaim 15 per cent of the gross amount for themselves. You can choose whether your covenant is net or gross. If the former - say, Pounds 10 a month - then the charity can recoup whatever the present basic rate tax might be on that amount. If gross, you would pay only Pounds 7.50 of that Pounds 10 at present; but, if tax rates change, you might pay more or less. Again, covenants are not suitable for use by non-taxpayers. The Charities Aid Foundation*, which is itself a charity, operates an account scheme for donors who want to spread their largesse between a range of charities. You pay money into the account using one of the tax-efficient methods - gift aid, Gaye or a covenant - so that tax can be reclaimed on your donation, and you receive a set of vouchers resembling a cheque book. The vouchers can then be given to any charity, for any amount you choose, or you can set up standing orders to specific charities. This means that you can take advantage of the tax breaks even to distribute small amounts of money to a number of charities. CAF charges a small percentage of your donation to cover administration costs. It also offers charity gift vouchers, which enable recipients to make a donation to the charity of their choice. One way to give yourself a warm, charitable glow without any immediate expense is to rewrite your will and include a few gifts of cash or goods to charities. Such bequests are free of inheritance tax and are an important source of funding for many charities - so much so that many provide guidance on how to make a will. Affinity credit cards are not a highly efficient way to give to charity, but every little helps. Affinity cards are ordinary Access or Visa cards which pay your chosen charity a fixed amount - usually Pounds 5 - when first you get the card, then donate 20p or 25p for every Pounds 100 you spend using it. To make a substantial donation this way, you would need to use the card extensively. If you spend Pounds 500 a month on it, then at 25p per Pounds 100 the charity would receive only Pounds 15 over the course of a year. And some cards charge an annual fee. The Co-op bank, Midland, Royal Bank of Scotland and the Bank of Scotland offer several affinity cards, but there are other operators. Ask your favourite charity if it has such a scheme. Some cards, such as the Visa issued by the Leeds building society, are automatically charity cards, distributing money to a number of popular charities. It might be a little early to start thinking about next year's Christmas presents but, in eight or nine months, the catalogues will be dropping through your letter box again and, these days, you can buy far more than Christmas cards from them. Commercial activities, such as gift catalogues and shops, are making a growing contribution towards funds for charities and some of them, particularly those related to the third world and the environment, also use these activities to further their aims by promoting trade and using sustainable resources. * Charities Aid Foundation, 48 Pembury Road, Tonbridge, Kent TN9 2JD.</p>

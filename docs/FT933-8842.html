			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Management: Tailoring offices to more modest times Jacques Attali would not have believed his eyes. Nor, for that matter, would the fiercest critics of his free-spending antics at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Even my humble taxi driver and I could scarcely credit it. After 10 minutes of searching up and down a Swiss city street, full of solid, multi-storey stone offices, we found the headquarters of the Pounds 1.7bn business we were seeking: an unassuming timber block which we had passed several times. The single-storey building was more reminiscent of a British post-war austerity 'prefab' or a Nissen hut than the base of a thrusting worldwide business. At best, it resembled a works canteen, or a cricket pavilion. Inside, all was creaky floors and dark linoleum. Even the boss's office, with its simple desk, table and chairs, was graced only by a warn oriental carpet. To a British eye, accustomed to all the marble, glitz and soaring atria with which corporate offices have been embroidered under American influence over the past 15 years, it certainly looked out of place. But could - or should - it be the shape of things to come? In a literal sense, obviously not: the 40-year-old building has worn well, but is less functional than it looks: its long corridors and inflexible partitions would impede the pattern of shifting group-work needed in most modern organisations. On the sweltering day of my visit, its lack of proper ventilation was annoying. And if it were built today, its poor 'plot' ratio (office space to site area) would give any modern developer a heart attack. Yet it stands for a principle that, with the glaring exception of banking, shows signs of returning to the very status-conscious Anglo-Saxon corporate world: that head-office buildings should not only be cost-effective, but should also reflect the individual character of the organisations within them, rather than some glossy theatrical norm. Since the nature of most organisations is changing, so should that of their HQs. It is a coincidence, but a most appropriate one, that the Swiss business I visited is in the midst of 're-engineering' its various processes, in common with many other European and American companies. In such organisations, processes which span such activities as order processing and logistics are being redesigned from scratch. Each unnecessary step is being stripped out. The same criterion should be applied to head offices. For both cost and psychological reasons, it is inappropriate for a 're-engineered' organisation to continue to occupy an HQ equipped with superfluous but expensive bells, whistles and decorations. If it really wants to remain lean and ultra-productive, and not re-accumulate fat, it must signal that intention to its employees at all levels, especially to its managers. This does not mean every company must move into Nissen huts, nor that we should return to the awful uniformity - and functional inadequacy - of the grey, faceless 1960s office block. Good designers can do far better than that. All around the world there are plenty of restrained, head-office buildings. In Japan some, like that of Brother, resemble little more than distribution depots. Many other companies have also resisted the temptation to follow most of their country's electronics and carmakers into ritzy, American-style corporate palaces. In the west, various HQs epitomise a form of understated grace which is worthy of any multinational anywhere: the most impressive are low-rise structures in Silicon Valley, such as those of Intel and Hewlett-Packard. In a different physical and development environment, the converted mills of several of their New England rivals, notably Digital, rate equally highly. European instances include Electrolux's sparse Stockholm HQ, a former factory. Its conversion was done with none of the interior ostentation of several recent refurbishments of well-known London buildings, including the former HQ of this newspaper. Whether a rehabilitated building is low or high rise, and was formerly industrial or commercial, the process of stripping out the old interior and replacing it with lean, purpose-designed office facilities, is obviously a form of 're-engineering'. But this does not mean that no re-engineered organisation should build anew; it is arguable that new-build is closer than rehab to the 'redesign from scratch' principle of re-engineering. Whether they redesign, or build from scratch, organisations of every kind should tailor their buildings to their peculiar requirements, both internal and external. In doing so, they must consider their employees' current - and future - working patterns, motivation and productivity. And they must weigh carefully the sort of external image they wish to project into a cost-conscious world. Organisations whose fortunes are based largely on image-creation, such as advertising agencies, will continue to require a fair degree of opulence and show in their buildings. But this does not necessarily entail vast cost; ingenuity is more important. Even a company which wants to broadcast its high-tech glamour by using the latest building technology need not spend the earth if it has a good architect. Most other types of organisation, should rein back their glitz and glamour by several degrees at least. They cannot do so instantly, since neither refurbishment nor new-build is an economic proposition for most of them in the current state of the office market. But, as more and more scale down their head offices for strategic or cost reasons, and need more modest-sized accommodation as a result, it will be instructive to see which of them tone down their opulence as well, and what character they create in its place. Shareholders and competitors, as well as re-engineering and design consultants, should monitor developments closely.</p>

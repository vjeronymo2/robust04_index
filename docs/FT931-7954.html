			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Economics: Focus on recovery prospects in G7 industrialised nations ATTENTION remains focused on the US this week, after the unveiling of President Bill Clinton's programme to tackle the budget deficit and stimulate economic recovery. Although The US January consumer confidence index due tomorrow is expected to be unchanged, the quarterly GDP figures due on Friday are expected to show a 4.5 per cent annualised growth, underlining the strength of the US economy at the time of President Clinton's election. With the UK also due to publish fourth quarter GDP figures this week, debate continues about the prospects for economic recovery. Although the GDP is predicted to be slightly down on last year, it is expected to show some improvement over the previous quarter. The CBI's monthly industrial trends survey on Friday will give a more up to date picture of business mood. The G7 finance ministers will meet in London on Saturday, amid continuing concern over the state of the world's economy, but no communique or decision is scheduled.

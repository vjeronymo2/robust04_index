			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Vietnam takes refinery bids Vietnam expects demand for oil products to outstrip supply by the time its first Dollars 1.2bn refinery is on stream in 1999 and is taking bids for its second refinery, agencies report from Hanoi. US companies are submitting offers following the lifting of Washington's economic embargo against Vietnam. A consortium led by Oklahoma-based Jopec and Canada's Saint Martino has already made a proposal, the weekly Vietnam Investment Review reported. A Houston-based company, Plant Processing Equipment, would handle technical work, it added. The bid was the first made public for the second refinery plan but stiff competition is expected. Vietnam exports most of its crude oil to Japan and Singapore and imports refined products.</p>

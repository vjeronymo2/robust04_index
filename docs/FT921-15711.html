			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / International Company News: High-tech plastics joint venture ELF ATOCHEM, the chemicals subsidiary of Elf Aquitaine, the French oil group, is considering a worldwide joint venture in high-performance plastics with Rohm and Haas, the US maker of Plexiglas. The companies are planning three joint ventures, for their acrylic sheet and powder moulding businesses, covering the US, western Europe and the rest of the world, to reduce manufacturing costs, share research and development and expand their product lines. High-performance plastics are used in buildings, car components and trim, sanitary ware, furniture and street signs, and the industry is dominated by some of the world's largest chemicals companies. Elf Atochem would not give the market share of its high-performance plastic, Altuglas, but it said: 'To stay competitive in the coming decade, a company must be present on at least two, if not on the three, main markets - Europe, northern America and Asia. It is already a reality for other producers.' The US joint venture will be 51 per cent controlled by Rohm and Haas; Elf Atochem will control the European business and the company for the rest of the world will be equally owned. Elf Atochem has annual sales of FFr50bn (Dollars 9.6bn), of which the equivalent of Dollars 250m is in performance plastics, about the same as Rohm and Haas, which has total sales of Dollars 2.8bn.</p>

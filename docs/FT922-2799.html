			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / Increase reported in consumer confidence CONSUMERS feel more confident about economic prospects over the next three months, but their spending intentions are virtually unchanged from a year ago. A survey of households by PA Cambridge Economic Consultants suggests that fear of unemployment and the depressed housing market are constraining consumer spending. In particular, plans to buy cars, durable goods and houses show no signs of recovery. The private-sector research company said its latest quarterly survey of consumer trends shows that although consumer confidence has improved to a level as good as any seen last year, on balance more consumers are still gloomy rather than optimistic about the future. The survey says consumers' confidence in their own financial situation, their employment prospects and the government's handling of the economy have improved compared with the last three months, but pessimists continue to outweigh optimists in the last two categories. Just over 26 per cent of those sampled expect the number of people employed at their workplace to fall over the next three months. This compares with 27 per cent in the first quarter and 32 per cent in the final quarter of last year. SALES of National Savings index-linked bonds reached their highest level in nearly two years last month. The amount invested totalled Pounds 211m, contributing to gross sales for the month of Pounds 840m. The highest single source of new income for National Savings last month was fixed-interest savings certificates of which Pounds 226m were sold. After repayments, including accumulated interest, net receipts amounted to Pounds 398m. The accrued interest was Pounds 154m, making the contribution to government funding Pounds 552m in May.</p>

			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: S African glass group cuts payout on earnings slide PLATE GLASS and Shatterprufe Industries (PGSI), part of the South African Breweries stable, reported a steep drop in earnings and is cutting its dividend. Increased second-half US losses and weakness in domestic markets left net attributable earnings 24.5 per cent lower at R50.8m (Dollars 14.1m) for the year to March 1992. The dividend is going down by 32 per cent to 150 cents a share. The directors said, however, they expected earnings growth in the current year as losses in Belron International, focus of the group's international trading activities, were expected to be considerably lower. Turnover last year dropped by 14 per cent to R1.98bn, due mainly to discontinued operations. Margins were also squeezed because of difficult trading conditions and development costs. This caused operating profit to fall by 19 per cent to R248m. At the net level, lower interest and tax bills were offset by an increase in preference dividends and an unchanged minority share. Last year's second half was eventful for PGSI with the acquisition from Pilkington of a half-share in Glass and of furniture group Afcol's 24 per cent holding in PG Bison. A R354m rights issue was successfully concluded. SA Breweries now has an effective 67 per cent controlling interest in PGSI following the acquisition of Placor, PGSI's holding company, and its financial participation in the Glass and PG Bison deals. Mr Ronnie Lubner, chairman, said the group planned to focus on continued leadership of the South African board and glass industries and on aggressive development of the offshore automotive replacement glass (ARG) installation business. PGSI has 600 ARG outlets in 11 countries. 'Following the Pilkington and Afcol deals, we now hold 97 per cent and 72 per cent of Glass and PG Bison respectively. We will continue to defend our position against imported glass and strive to be globally competitive,' said Mr Lubner. Other than the UK, Benelux and central Africa, which returned good results, the other main divisions experienced lower profits. Efforts by US management to cut costs and increase marketing initiatives were countered by a 4 per cent market dip and falling prices. Increased competition and the slowdown in the automotive, building and furniture industries in South Africa hampered the performance of local operations.</p>

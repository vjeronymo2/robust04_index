			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on the "Statement by Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign </F> Affairs"]    [Text] In connection with the 13 April information carried  by "Ostankino" (in the "News" program) to the effect that,  during the negotiations in Kiev, an accord was allegedly reached  that the sides would resolve the Black Sea Fleet problems based  on the Massandra Protocol, Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs  contends that this does not correspond to reality. Ukraine  proceeds from the need for a comprehensive approach toward the  issue of the Black Sea Fleet, taking into account the  regulations of the Dagomys, Yalta, and Zavidovo Accords, as well  as of the Massandra Protocol. Nor does the "Ostankino"  information on the visit to Odessa by a delegation of the  Russian Federation correspond to reality.    Contrary to the accords reached in Kiev, the commander in  chief of the Russian Navy. S. Gromov, wrecked the meeting with  the command and officers' personnel of the Black Sea Fleet, a  meeting that had been planned jointly with the Ukrainian side.  Such information and actions show who places obstacles to a  just resolution of the Black Sea Fleet problem.</p>

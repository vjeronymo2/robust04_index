			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Criminal gun rules 'free' Cambodia: After 23 years of civil war nearly everyone is armed Mr Benoit Duchateau-Arminjon's La Casa restaurant in Phnom Penh set up the Cambodian capital's first pizza delivery service in September. The trouble is, last orders have to be phoned in well before 8pm because even La Casa's pizzas are not worth dying for. Mr Duchateau-Arminjon says it is too dangerous for his staff to be out on their Hondas after eight. The pages of the Phnom Penh newspapers testify to the alarming murder rate in the capital. Just about every day people are shot dead just for their mopeds. Prince Norodom Ranariddh, the senior prime minister, has tired of what he sees as the negative reporting of security in his country. He frequently lectures journalists on comparative crime rates around the world. Violent crime in New York, he asserted recently, was 10,000 times worse than in Cambodia. But such dubious statistics provide cold comfort to those unfortunate enough to be caught in one of the capital's terrifying regular gun-battles. Last month an attempted motorcycle robbery erupted into a small war outside this correspondent's house in suburban Phnom Penh. It was the third shooting incident in the street in as many weeks. For 15 minutes, bullets ricocheted off the road and gateposts. A waiting taxi was caught in the gunfire. Its windows were shot out and it was riddled with bullets. Local residents who did not join the fray threw themselves down on their floors. Amazingly no one was hit. In modern Cambodia, gun law rules: nearly everyone owns one, and to prove it they all fire into the clouds during thunderstorms. After 23 years of civil war, it is a buyers' market when it comes to procuring weapons, ammunition and explosives. Anyone can buy a Kalashnikov assault rifle and a clip of ammunition for Dollars 50 on the black market. The United Nations peacekeeping mission in Cambodia finished just over a year ago. It was hailed as a success because the UN had supervised elections which installed a democratic government. But the UN failed to deliver on its mandate in one vital area: its peacekeepers did not demobilise the four factions, whose armies were still armed to the teeth. The Khmer Rouge have returned to the battlefield and remain a threat to national security. But the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces - an amalgamation of the three other factions - are just as dangerous. Unpaid and undisciplined, they roam the countryside, terrorising villagers, extorting money, running protection rackets, robbing, looting and killing. Last month a report by Mr John Holloway, the former Australian ambassador to Cambodia, was leaked to the press. In his assessment of the security situation he wrote: 'Rural villagers are more scared of government forces than they are of the Khmer Rouge.' Few informed observers would disagree. 'Power belongs to those who have guns,' says a human rights investigator in Phnom Penh. 'The military are predators in this country: 60 to 70 per cent of abuses against the population are committed by the armed forces, but they are outside the law.' Earlier this year, a UN human rights report alleged that the powerful military intelligence bureau was involved in organised crime, contract killing, torture and extrajudicial execution in the north-western province of Battambang. Senior military officers were directly implicated. None of those named in that report was sacked. Human rights groups say government investigations have been nothing but whitewash. Their conclusion: that the lack of political will to stop such criminal activity reflects the government's fear that it will not receive western military aid if the allegation sticks. The many local and international human rights groups operating in Cambodia say the army is out of control. Many of the reported motorcycle and car thefts in the capital involve men in military uniforms. Last month a Land Cruiser was stolen from one UN agency. It turned up in a villa owned by a colonel from military intelligence. What is more worrying is that bundles of documented circumstantial evidence point to the fact that the rise in violent crime is being used to camouflage politically motivated killings. The outspoken editor of a popular Khmer-language newspaper was shot dead in broad daylight recently as he rode his motorcycle along a busy Phnom Penh street. Local journalists live in fear. The next day, a car belonging to a UN human rights centre employee was stolen at gunpoint. The employee's five-year-old daughter was abducted and shot in the leg. The centre concluded that the attack was more than a car theft gone wrong. Other human rights groups believe the incident was in reprisal for the centre's report on military abuses in Battambang. No one has been arrested for either crime. 'And no one will be,' says a human rights worker. 'Because the problem is, they'll say who ordered them to do it.' There are rumours that those behind the killings occupy untouchable positions within the political or military hierarchy. The hands of police investigators might be tied, but the forces of law and order also have a pitiful reputation. The police run protection rackets too and some local residents find they have been mysteriously burgled when they do not pay up. Drunken officers are often trigger-happy too. Cambodia is one of the poorest countries in the world and the rewards of violent crime are considered worth the risks - which are not so high given that criminals can buy their way out of a murder charge for less than Dollars 3,000. The cost of hiring a contract killer is much less. As one Cambodian political analyst puts it: 'Today we have democracy, a free press and a free market, but people now ask how free we really are.' The Cambodian people - who for successive generations have lived under god kings, military dictators, fanatical Maoists and communists - have been left to conclude that liberty is anarchy.</p>

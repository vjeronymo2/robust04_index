			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Venture capital investment down by 17% THE UK venture capital industry invested 17 per cent less money last year in what it said was 'the most hostile environment for investment in unquoted companies for many years'. Venture capitalists spent Pounds 1.15bn last year on 1,386 companies, a decline of 11 per cent on the number of company investments in 1990, according to the annual report of the British Venture Capital Association. The industry put 86 per cent of its money into British companies compared with just 79 per cent in 1990, and halved the percentage of funds going to continental Europe to 8 per cent. The 110 venture capital companies which responded to the survey - out of 114 association members - invested Pounds 989m in nearly 1,200 UK companies. This represented a fall of 11 per cent in the amount invested and a 2 per cent fall in the number of companies backed compared with 1990. Start-up and early-stage financings accounted for just under a quarter of UK deals and for 6 per cent of money invested. This was lower than in 1990 when they accounted for just over a quarter of deals and 12 per cent of funds invested. Consumer-related business continued to dominate investments by sector, the report notes, attracting 33 per cent of the total amount invested. In spite of a sharp fall in the amount of money raised for venture capital investments last year to Pounds 368m from about Pounds 830m in 1990, the UK venture capital industry still has an uninvested pool of funds worth about Pounds 2bn.

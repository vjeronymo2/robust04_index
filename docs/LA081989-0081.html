			<p><P> August 19, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POPE TO VISIT TIJUANA, 17 OTHER MEXICAN CITIES NEXT MAY  </P> <P> Pope John Paul II will visit Mexico for eight days next May, including the  California-Mexican border city of Tijuana and at least 17 other cities, the  Mexican bishops' conference has announced.  </P> <P> It will be John Paul's second trip to Mexico as Pope and his first to Tijuana,  where he is expected to end his tour on May 13 before returning to Rome. In his  January, 1979, Mexico visit, the pontiff warned the Latin American bishops,  meeting in Puebla, against politicizing the church's mission to promote social  justice and help the poor. He will return to Puebla on May 9, according to an  advance schedule released in Mexico City.  </P> <P> Mexico City Auxiliary Bishop Genaro Alamilla told a news conference that the  Pope's visit to the capital city and 13 Mexican states -- representing all  major regions of Mexico -- will include meetings with laborers, religious and  lay leaders, journalists and youth. The Pope is expected to address Mexico's  foreign debt, drug trafficking, the family, abortion and contraception, and  migration problems.  </P> <P> Left-wing opposition leaders have accused the Roman Catholic Church of using  the visit to promote political reform of the Mexican Constitution, but Alamilla  said the visit would be a pastoral one.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 19, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 2 ARTS GROUPS BETTER THEIR SCORES IN GRANT EVALUATIONS  </P> <P> Two Orange County arts groups received higher ratings than last year, and four  others lost no ground during annual evaluations Friday for California Arts  Council grants.  </P> <P> An advisory panel measured organizational as well as artistic strength using a  four-point scale. It gave the Pacific Chorale, Pacific Symphony, Opera Pacific  and Garden Grove Symphony ranks of 4-, 3, 3 and 2+, respectively, the same each  received last year. The Master Chorale of Orange County went from 3 to 4-, and  the South Coast Symphony went from 3- to 3.  </P> <P> Arts council officials say the correlation between rankings and actual grants  will depend on the size of the arts council budget, which will be determined  this summer. In past years, grants have been awarded to groups with ranks of 3-  and above.  </P> <P> Panel members included John Alexander, artistic director of the Pacific  Chorale. He left the room when his group was discussed, however.  </P> <P> In talking about Opera Pacific late Thursday, Patricia Mitchell, deputy general  director of the Los Angeles Music Center Opera, praised artistic director David  DiChiera for "trying to move the repertory into a more serious direction with  more emphasis on grand opera and less on musical theater."  </P> <P> (Opera Pacific administrative director Patrick Flynn, observing the panel  meeting, said the company's 1991 season could be its first with no musical at  all. He explained that the troupe wants to "broaden its operatic repertory" and  that there are few musicals available. There will be an announcement on the  choices in a few weeks, Flynn said.)  </P> <P> Opera Pacific received $41,880 last year.  </P> <P> Panelists praised Pacific Symphony's performances and its "high standards," but  they said they are concerned about the 11-year-old orchestra's accumulated  deficit of $711,271 (its budget is $4.7 million).  </P> <P> "Hopefully, with a new music director in place, they can get on with the  business of reducing this deficit," said Berkeley pianist Rae Imamura. Carl St.  Clair was hired in February, ending a two-year search to replace founding music  director Keith Clark. St. Clair will assume the post in October.  </P> <P> The orchestra received $39,319 last year.  </P> <P> Tere Romo, manager of the arts council Organizational Support Program, noted  that while the boards of both the orchestra and opera company grew over the  past year, the number of minorities on those boards did not. Board diversity  has been a major arts council concern and a criterion for awarding grants.  </P> <P> Panelists applauded, though, the increase in the number of minority artists  hired by the opera (from 482 to 511) and Pacific Symphony's programming of a  work by Jose Pablo Moncayo, a major Latino composer.  </P> <P> In July, the orchestra and opera troupe will each be given another ranking for  community outreach, and that will affect their overall scores. Further, all  rankings are subject to approval by the full council late this summer.  </P> <P> The two chorales, the South Coast Symphony and the Garden Grove Symphony were  discussed earlier in the week.  </P></p>

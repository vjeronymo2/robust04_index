			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The commenter further states that the SB should specify a different oxygen canister safety cap. The revised SB specifies two safety caps.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenter further states that a functional test should be required prior to disassembly. The FAA does not concur. The FAA has determined that a functional test prior to disassembly would not provide any benefit in evaluating the passenger oxygen system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenter further states that there should be a snag test on the release pin for grooves and burrs. The FAA does not concur. The FAA believes that the instructions for testing as stated in the revised SB are adequate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since publication of the NPRM, the manufacturer has advised the FAA that an additional safety cap, Scott Part Number (P/N) 36425&hyph;00, is available. Also, the manufacturer has added a black plastic grommet, P/N 91880&hyph;2, on the pin release bracket, and a bushing, P/N 121836&hyph;1, on the activator assembly spring, P/N H13341. Finally, the manufacturer has included instructions for verifying the gap between the cable actuating lever and the cable activating lever stop in PTC Aerospace SB No. 25&hyph;1233, Revision E, dated April 15, 1994. These revised instructions have been added to the compliance section of this final rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes described previously. The FAA has determined that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The initial estimate in the NPRM of approximately 3,000 passenger oxygen systems of the affected design in the worldwide fleet was incorrect. The manufacturer has advised the FAA that the revised number is 4,800 passenger oxygen systems in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 4,000 passenger oxygen systems are installed on aircraft of U.S. registry, of which 2,500 have already been modified, leaving approximately 1,500 passenger oxygen systems that have not yet been modified in accordance with this AD. The FAA estimates that it will take approximately 1 work hour per passenger oxygen system to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts will cost approximately $20 per passenger oxygen system. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $112,500.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Incorporation by reference, Safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Adoption of the Amendment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration amends part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

"Are you declaring a war?"    "You declared a war first. Seoul is not far from here. If a  war breaks out, Seoul will also be a sea of fire. Mr. Song, you  will not be safe, either."    Dialogue held between Song Yong-tae, chief South Korean  delegate and vice minister of the National Unification Board  [NUB] and Pak Yong-su, chief North Korean delegate and deputy  director of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the  Fatherland, was aired nationwide that day on the nine-o'clock  [12:00 GMT] evening news, and North-South relations now face a  situation which is dominated not by issues of dialogue and  negotiations, but by issues of confrontation and security that  call for the deployment of Patriot missiles and warnings of  withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty.    Even though the image was blurred, the North Korean  delegate's "extreme remarks" were conveyed vividly like a live  broadcast, and can be viewed as a threat to the South.  Attention is now focusing on why the contents, which might  amplify people's fears, were allowed to be broadcast without any  filtering.    Scenes of none of the seven contacts to date were reported.  Only the greeting sessions prior to talks were open to  reporters and photographers. While North Korea's remarks at the  last contact were far more serious than its previous "threats,"  the government's release of footage of the talks to broadcasting  stations was also exceptional, especially when considering that  the talks were, as before, held in "closed session."    Heads of relevant departments, including the Vice Premier  and  NUB Minister and the Senior Presidential Secretary for foreign  affairs and security, were able to watch the development of the  talks even though the North-South contacts at Panmunjom were  held in closed sessions, to allow for quick evaluation of  developments in the talks, quick countermeasures, and provision  of new guidelines in answer to the other side's position.    While only audio is available when talks are held at the  North side's Tongilgak, both audio and video are available  through closed-circuit television [CCTV] when talks are held in  the South side's Peace House. Furthermore, it has been learned  that CCTVs are installed at Chongwadae [presidential office],  the Secretariat for North-South talks, and the Agency for  National Security Planning, so policymakers monitoring the talks  on the CCTVs, clearly heard the North Korean delegate Pak  Yong-su's remarks of "Seoul sea of fire," as the eighth contact  happened to take place at the Peace House.    Details of how the government came to the decision to  release  the contents on video tapes to broadcast stations are unknown.  It did not take the government very long, however, to decide to  "vividly" convey the remarks in question to the people. Around  2 PM [05:00 GMT] that day, less than three hours after the talks  had ended, the NUB asked broadcast station reporters who were  covering the day's talks if there were any technical problems in  airing footage recorded from the CCTV and when their deadlines  were. In answer to the question of whether this would violate  the agreement between the South and the North to keep the talks  closed, the NUB explained that North Korea had also made the  contents of the talks public. This later turned out to be a  poor excuse. It was 9:00 PM [12:00 GMT] in the evening the next  day [20 March] when North Korea reported the eighth contact in  detail through its CENTRAL BROADCAST.    Concerning this, an NUB official said: "The video tape was  released to convey the fact to the people matter-of-factly that  North Korea made such intimidating remarks."    After viewing the two-minute-and-forty-second tape, a  broadcast station executive asked related departments, including  the Chongwadae, for confirmation that the contents were allowed  to be aired. The answer from the Chongwadae was: "We are aware  of the fact." The announcement of the decision to deploy  Patriot missiles, whose deployment was the subject of much  controversy, was subsequently made during the security-related  ministers' meeting on 21 March.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Press review] </F>   [Text] Today's press commentaries address the clear and  unambiguous Syrian position on the peace process, as well as  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's tour of the region.    In its commentary today, the newspaper AL-BA'TH asserts that  Syria's clear and unambiguous position on the peace process can  no longer be questioned. This is because it is a position that  is committed to international legitimacy, as well as the peace  initiative that aims to achieve just and comprehensive peace in  the most dangerous hotbed of tension in the world.    AL-BA'TH adds: As for Israel, regardless of its wordplay and  deception, it cannot cover up for its obstruction of peace  efforts. Nor can it, for that matter, cover up for its  continuous crimes in the occupied Arab territories and the  defenseless Lebanese towns.    The paper goes on to say: The recent Israeli escalation,  which has taken place on the eve of the date set for  Christopher's new tour of the region, has demonstrated that  Israel is persisting with its policy of seeking to conclude  unilateral and separate deals with the Arab sides. This  escalation is also part of efforts to bring pressure to bear on  Syria to make it change its firm and principled position on the  peace process.    But, it remains to be said, AL-BA'TH says, that the language  of threats and pressures will not undermine the Syrian position.    The paper concludes by saying: If the U.S. secretary of  state were to suddenly decide on a quick return to the region,  he must use various cards that could help him make progress.  This is necessary if his country is to play the role of a full  partner and an honest broker, as his administration has  repeatedly said it would. The party that is obstructing the  peace process; namely, Israel, must be the target of this role.    In the "With the Events" column, AL-BA'TH comments on the  dangers posed by the Zionist onslaught against Arab Jerusalem.    Under the headline "There Can Be No Peace Without Syria,"  the  newspaper TISHRIN notes that U.S. officials have ruled out a  possible tour of the Middle East by U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher at present. The paper also notes Israel's  efforts to deceive the world public and conceal its constant  attempts to scuttle the peace process by thwarting the efforts  under way to advance the peace talks.    TISHRIN adds: As is well known to everybody, Syria has  declared its clear commitment to implementing the relevant UN  Security Council resolutions and meeting all the requirements of  just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East. It has matched  words with deeds, and repeatedly helped save the peace process  from Israeli conspiracies in order to render the U.S. efforts a  success. Israel alone has deliberately tried to obstruct the  peace process. It has publicly called for replacing the  Washington talks, which are based on the Madrid formula, with  separate negotiations.    TISHRIN goes on to say: The new Israeli escalation in  southern Lebanon confirms anew the Tel Aviv government's  rejection of just and comprehensive peace, the relevant UN  Security Council resolutions, and the land-for-peace formula.    Concluding its commentary, TISHRIN argues that it is  impossible to achieve peace in the region without an effective  U.S. intervention, and unless the U.S. commitments and pledges  are translated into acts and realities on the ground through  pressures on Israel to make it abandon its obstructionist  approach and succumb to international legitimacy.    The paper adds: Syria is eager to achieve peace. Its  efforts to achieve it are unmistakable. Nonetheless, Syria  seeks to restore all its territories. For Syria cannot abandon  its territories, nor can it bargain over these territories. And  without Syria, there can be no peace in the Middle East.    In the "Opinion" column, the newspaper TISHRIN comments on  the dangers posed by the Israeli Judaization and settlement plan  in the occupied territories. It also views neofascism in Italy  under the "Viewpoint" column.    Under the headline "Between Two Stands," the newspaper  AL-THAWRAH says: The entire world community, and the U.S.  Administration in particular, has seen Syria's eagerness to  achieve just and comprehensive peace on the basis of the  principles on which the Madrid conference convened--the  principles pertaining to the implementation of the relevant  resolutions, particularly the principle of trading land for  peace.    AL-THAWRAH adds: The fact that is widely known to the entire  world community is that Syria's serious approach toward the  issue of achieving just and comprehensive peace is not a  transient development. Syria has always championed the cause of  peace, and favorably responded to all the efforts and  initiatives grounded in international legitimacy and the  restoration of territories and rights.    The U.S. administration, through President Clinton, has  repeatedly expressed its convictions regarding Syria's truthful  peace intentions, noting that Syria has responded to all peace  efforts to render the peace process a success.    AL-THAWRAH goes on to say: Israel has demonstrated that it  is opposed to just, comprehensive, and viable peace. This is  because it is adhering to the strategy of expansion and holding  on to the occupied Arab territories. It is not contributing to  the success of the peace process. As a matter of fact, it is  doing all it can to scuttle the peace process to cause it to  collapse and render it void of any meaningful content. Syria  has declared its willingness to meet the demands of the  international community with regard to the implementation of  international legitimacy resolutions, because it believes that  the terms of reference of the peace process upheld by the  cosponsors of this process are in line with its pro-peace  approach, which is tantamount to a full-blown strategy,  particularly since the issue at stake is the restoration of all  rights, and all occupied territories.    AL-THAWRAH concludes by saying: Syria has demonstrated a  credible peace stance. In the same vein, it has addressed a  letter to the entire world community, saying that it cannot  abandon a single iota of its national soil, and that the Israeli  version of peace is unviable, because Israel wants to achieve  peace and maintain the occupation of Arab territories.    In another commentary, AL-THAWRAH says: Undoubtedly, Israel  will be mistaken if it believes that it can promote its  erroneous concepts and ideas regarding the achievement of peace  in the region. It must realize quite well that Syria, without  which there can be no peace, will accept nothing short of a just  and comprehensive peace that would ensure the restoration of all  occupied Arab territories to their rightful owners. If Israel  is truly seeking peace, it must realize that peace is achievable  only when the last Israeli soldier is evicted from the last inch  of the occupied Golan territory, and other occupied territories.</p>

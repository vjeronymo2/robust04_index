			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / UK Company News: TSB to take full control of Jersey subsidiary TSB, the seventh largest UK banking group, is to buy out the minority shareholders in TSB Bank Channel Islands, its Jersey-based subsidiary. TSB said TSBCI would continue to offer a full range of clearing bank services in the Channel Islands, but it now plans to use its operation on the islands to develop offshore businesses. The four independent directors on the TSBCI board are recommending shareholders to accept the offer. Mr Alastair Dempster, TSBCI's chief executive, who was recently appointed chief executive of TSB Bank Scotland, will be succeeded by Mr Martin Chambers, managing director of Hill Samuel Bank (Jersey), as soon as the offer becomes effective. TSBCI had total assets of Pounds 1.34bn at the end of April. Its half year results to April 30 announced yesterday showed a pre-tax profit of Pounds 4.77m, against a loss of Pounds 483,000 in the same period a year ago when it was hit by a Pounds 5.78m loss on foreign exchange irregularities in its Treasury. Earnings per share were 13.19p, against losses of 1.39p per share a year ago. The interim divided is 4p (3.45p). In the year to October 31 1991, TSBCI made pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.48m and had a net asset value of Pounds 52.7m. About 49 per cent of TSBCI's shares were floated on the Stock Exchange in 1986. TSB Group already owns all the A ordinary shares in TSBCI and controls 51 per cent of the total stock. TSBCI shareholders will be offered 250p cash for each share or seven new TSB group and 13p in cash for every four TSBCI shares. The offer is 63 per cent above the TSBCI closing price of 153p on May 29.</p>

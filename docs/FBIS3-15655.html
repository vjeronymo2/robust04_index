It reported that  an exchange of Iranian oil for Ukrainian artillery mounts took  place in 1992. According to the Iranian diplomat, his state  exchanged oil neither for artillery mounts nor even for tank  spares. Earlier, Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy  had stated that, while he is an advocate of the arms trade,  nevertheless Ukraine should not for the moment sell off its  arsenals; it is necessary first to create a closed production  cycle.</p>

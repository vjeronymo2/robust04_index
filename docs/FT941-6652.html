			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / People: BP Energy Peter Duffy (above) has been appointed managing director of BP Energy, the British Petroleum division which operates industrial power plants on behalf of clients. Duffy, an industrial chemist by training, has spent the past 13 years with BP. He was most recently responsible for the industrial and public sector fuels business. BP's energy division has grown rapidly in recent years, with turnover climbing from Pounds 7m in 1990 to Pounds 25m last year. The industry has been boosted by the trend among industrial companies of contracting out those activities not seen as critical to their core operations.</p>

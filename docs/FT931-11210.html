			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets: Buenos Aires eases back after rollercoaster ride - Prospects for Argentine equities ARGENTINA was never going to be a smooth ride, but even hard bitten players of the developing world's equity markets have had an uncomfortable time over the last few months. After crashing 48 per cent in the second half of 1992, and then recovering strongly through until mid-January, the market has seen its upward surge peter out. Yesterday the Merval index closed at 413.38, 3 per cent down since the beginning of the year. Brokers, eternal optimists, say that this will be the year when Buenos Aires finally breaks with its speculative past and starts growing into a mature capital market. Although they have been saying this for a long time, and even though Argentines still play the market as if it were a casino, as long as Argentina's free market reforms remain on track its equity markets will probably remain attractive. Mr Eduardo Tapia, director general of Baring Securities Argentina SA, doubts that there much chance of a repeat of the 1991 boom which drove prices up by 372 per cent, because investors' funds, resources and new share issues waiting to hit the market will cancel each other out. 'There will not be a boom,' says Mr Tapia, 'but a positive trend all along the year.' This hypothesis has its weaknesses. Argentine shares are not exactly cheap. Baring's forecasts indicate a price earnings ratio of 13.1 for the market this year, against 16.9 for 1992. On the other side of the coin, there is no underestimating Argentines' herd instinct. On Friday, within minutes of the government announcing new measures deregulating financing markets, share prices began rising, to close 9 per cent up in the day. Argentines account for two-thirds of market turnover. As soon as they notice foreigners entering the market in force, which is widely believed to signal a change in market fortunes, they too frantically pile in and push prices to unsustainable levels. This situation could lead to a sharp downward correction which would shake the market, deflect capital from Argentina and discourage new companies from entering the market. About three dozen new companies are in the pipeline for a market debut at the moment. The greatest fear of all surrounds President Carlos Menem's determination to amend the constitution, which bans re-election of incumbents, and so stand for re-election when his term ends in 1995. To do so, he must sweep congressional elections slated for this autumn and win two-thirds of the seats in the lower house of Congress. Investors worry that Mr Menem will slacken his reforms to win the elections. Alternatively, defeat could fatally damage his authority. Any sign of political compromise or weakness could lead to a massive capital outflow, further undermining confidence. Pessimists point to the government's failure to win passage through Congress of key labour and social security reforms. Trade unions, which still retain considerable influence, are successfully resisting both measures, which would reduce companies' costs and create a private pension fund system, the basis of any modern stock market. Disquiet over Mr Menem's future is likely to grow in the second half, as election day approaches and as the overheated economy, which the government says grew 9 per cent in 1992, settles down to growth of about 3-4 per cent. But analysts say that this scenario should not be overrated. The government's credibility is based on maintaining the pace of reform. Devaluation of the overvalued peso is also ruled out for political reasons and because Argentina's big companies - traditionally, powerful supporters of a cheap peso - have taken on heavy hard currency debts. Companies that restructure are going to be OK', says Mr Christopher Ecclestone, equities analyst at the Buenos Aires brokers Elizalde &amp; Cia. Argentina's big companies are undoubtedly embarked on a 'dramatic reform process', he says, but he warns local investors, in particular, not to hold their breath. Argentina set out two years ago on a road that took 20 years to bear fruit in Chile, and 10 years in Mexico.</p>

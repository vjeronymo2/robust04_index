			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 27 May (PL) -- Cuban Vice Foreign Minister  Jorge Bolanos today said the Fourth Ibero-American Summit to be  held in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, in June, will be more  dynamic and fluid and less protocol-oriented.    In statements to PRENSA LATINA, Bolanos viewed as very  positive the concept of the summit's program, which will provide  more room for conversations and debates among the participating  chiefs of state.    He indicated that, in addition to the presidential speeches,  among the meeting innovations will be a panel chaired by three  Latin American personalities, whose identities have yet to be  announced, but who will discuss topics dealing with the flow of  investments, integration, and the way to finance regional social  changes.    Asked about the importance of the Ibero-American forums, he  argued that it lies in the desire to meet at Ibero-America's own  initiative and without an extraterritorial mandate to discuss  the region's problems and the way to resolve them within a  spirit of concerted effort, cooperation, and integration.    He emphasized that the participation of a socialist Cuba in  the main meeting of the Ibero-American family reaffirms the  principle for which Latin America has struggled so much, which  is respect for the sovereignty of peoples.    In this regard, he added that the island's participation  means a rejection of the policy of exclusion that this nation  has been a victim of in the past 30 years and that it is a sign  of the strength of the Cuban process, even in very difficult  moments and adverse international conditions.    In these summits, he added, our country has spoken not only  for itself, but for the region, defending such concepts as  development with social justice and the fact that these forums  cannot ignore the millions of Latin Americans who live in  conditions below the poverty line.    In conclusion, he said the documents of the presidential  conference must be a reflection of all Latin America not only of  a part of this geographic region.</p>

			<p>SUMMARY                                 Ukrainian democrats have been making great efforts in recent  months to unite for the 27 March legislative elections, trying to  avoid the fate suffered by disorganized and mutually antagonistic  Russian reformers in December.  As the nomination of candidates  ends, however, they remain divided by personal rivalries and  policy differences and have succeeded in uniting behind common  candidates in only a limited number of districts.  Despite all  the publicity for the parties, nonparty candidates nominated by  the official establishment and industrial and agricultural  organizations may win the most seats, aided by the winner-take-  all election system mandated by the Ukraine's election law                            END SUMMARY      Ukrainian political parties have had ample time to organize and  form alliances for the elections compared to their Russian  counterparts, who had only two and a half months.  On 24  September 1993 President Leonid Kravchuk signed a law passed by  the Supreme Soviet setting parliamentary elections for 27 March  1994 (Holos Ukrainy, 28 September 1993) and giving candidates  until late January to collect the 300 signatures necessary to  register (Vidomosti Verkhovnoi Rady Ukrainy, 30 November 1993).  Russian parties were required to collect and submit 100,000  signatures for registration within a little over a month after  the announcement that the election would be held, and many failed  to meet the 6 November deadline and were kept off the ballot.      In another significant divergence, the Russian election law was  designed to strengthen parties by allocating one half of the  State Duma's seats on the basis of party lists, while Ukraine  adopted a pure majority system and other measures apparently  intended to weaken parties.  The Ukrainian Supreme Soviet (in its  "first reading" of the bill) on 10 November rejected proportional  representation and retained the traditional system of district  elections where candidates compete in a winner-take-all contest  (Uryadovyy Kuryer, 13 November 1993).  Moreover, the Supreme  Soviet compounded the blow against parties by adding, on the  second and final reading of the bill on 18 November, a provision  allowing labor collectives and trade unions, as well as parties,  to nominate candidates (Kyivska Pravda, 19 November 1993; Ukraina  Moloda, 28 December 1993).  Some trade unions decided to nominate  their own candidates instead of cooperating with parties.  This  hurt Rukh, for example, which had counted on an alliance with  some trade unions to help it win seats in Donetsk (Ukraina  Moloda, 28 December 1993).  Reflecting the law's devaluation of  parties, when registration ended in late January, 1,768  candidates had been nominated by labor collectives versus only  707 by parties (UNIAN, 2 February).  (Apparently some party  affiliated candidates have been nominated by "labor collectives"  or "groups of electors," meaning that there really are more than  707 party candidates.  A 28 January Kyivska Pravda article on  candidate registration in Kiev Oblast said that parties nominated  12 of their members locally but that in all, 46 party-affiliated  candidates were running.)      In another contrast to the Russian election law, the Ukrainian  law requires candidates to win a majority of votes cast  (Vidomosti Verkhovnoi Rady Ukrainy, 30 November 1993).  Russian  law requires only a plurality.  With 6,565 candidates running for  450 seats (UNIAN, 2 February), many races will require runoffs,  as in the 1990 parliamentary election.  The Ukrainian law orders  runoffs held within two weeks after the first round, giving  parties a short time to work out alliances for the runoff round.      Democrats Sign an Agreement      To avoid fragmenting their vote and thus risking elimination of  their candidates on the first round, democratic parties have been  striving to form blocs and set up structures to facilitate  cooperation.  The Supreme Soviet's rejection of proportional  representation spurred this movement further, since small parties  have little chance of winning any seats under the majority,  winner-take-all system.  Democratic parties took an important  step toward unity in mid-October when 18 parties and  organizations issued a declaration calling for cooperation in the  election.  Although recognizing that "creation of a single  electoral bloc of democratic parties and organizations to  nominate a single bloc candidate in each electoral district is in  practice impossible today," the parties agreed to "coordinate  actions" by seeking to adopt a new election law providing for  proportional representation or a mixed proportional  representation-majority system, to agree on single candidates  whenever possible, to attack only communists and not other  democratic candidates, and to unite behind one democratic  candidate if there are runoffs (Vecherniy Kiev, 20 October 1993).      A surprisingly wide array of democratic parties, including some  that are usually mutually hostile, signed the declaration.  Signers included Vyacheslav Chornovil's anti-Kravchuk Rukh; the  pro-Kravchuk, anti-Chornovil Democratic Party of Ukraine (DemPU)  and Ukrainian Republican Party (URP); and the less nationalistic,  pro-reform, anti-Kravchuk New Ukraine and Party of Democratic  Revival of Ukraine (PDVU); and even one of the rightwing parties  on the fringe of the democratic classification--the Congress of  Ukrainian Nationalists (KUN).  Of the democratic parties, only  the anti-Chornovil National Rukh of Ukraine (VNRU), whose leader,  Larysa Skoryk, opposed coordination and insisted that there be a  choice of democratic candidates (Post-Postup, 30 December-5  January), Anatoliy Matviyenko's centrist Labor Congress of  Ukraine (TKU), Ihor Markulov's Donetsk-based pro-business Liberal  Party of Ukraine, and Vladimir Zolotarev's pro-economic reform  Constitutional Democrats did not sign.  Not surprisingly, most  ultranationalists (the Ukrainian National Assembly, National  Conservative Party, and Stepan Khmara's Ukrainian Conservative  Republican Party), and, of course, the Communist Party of Ukraine  (KPU) and parties close to it--the Socialist Party of Ukraine  (SPU), Party of Labor, United Social Democratic Party, Peasant  Party of Ukraine (SelPU), Peasant Union of Ukraine, and the Civil  Congress--did not join.     Weak Coordinating Structures      The agreement's signers set up a coordinating structure but the  structures were too weak to prevent parties from going their own  ways.  The signatories--joined by the centrist Labor Congress  (TKU)--on 11 November met to discuss creating a coordinating  committee for the election but all they could agree on was to  establish a procedure for party leaders to consult with each  other on a weekly basis--a "Permanent Conference of Democratic  Parties and Organizations of Ukraine" (UNIAN, 12 November 1993;  Kievskiye Vedomosti, 16 November 1993).  Later they agreed to  create a "Center for Promoting Ukraine's Democracy and  Statehood," with former Rukh Chairman Ivan Drach, former URP  Chairman Levko Lukyanenko, and Chornovil supporter Serhiy Odarych  as co-chairmen (Holos Ukrainy, 11 December 1993).  Eventually 40  organizations joined, including various groups of businessmen and  entrepreneurs such as economic reformer Volodymyr Lanvoyy and the  All-Ukrainian Association of Private Owners, which he recently  founded, according to Lukyanenko (Molod Ukrainy, 11 January).  In  the meantime, the PDVU and Party of Greens reportedly backed out,  apparently feeling that the URP was using the center for its own  benefit (UNIAN weekly "Views, Commentaries, Forecasts," 30  December 1993).  The organization, by then referred to as the  All-Ukrainian Electoral Committee of the Democratic Association  bloc, met in early January to coordinate lists of candidates from  member-parties (UNIAR, 4 January).      Democratic Blocs      The parties that signed the mid-October declaration were unable  to form a single, unified democratic bloc.  Instead, three main  election blocs emerged, based on existing movements--Rukh, the  Congress of National Democratic Forces (KNDS), and New Ukraine.  Weakness and divisions within New Ukraine prompted its leaders to  form additional blocs, some with overlapping membership, to  replace or supplement New Ukraine.      --Election 94     On 24 October Rukh passed a resolution calling  for "centrist democratic" parties to unite against the  communists, the "party of power" (i.e., Kravchuk and other  government officials), and "right radicals" by creating an  election bloc called the "Association of Democratic Forces  'Election 94'" with oblast and election district branches  (Vecherniy Kiev, 27 October 1993).  Rukh, led by Chornovil, is  largely based in the west Ukraine.  It is nationalistic but  stresses political and economic reform more than many other  nationalist organizations, and it opposes Kravchuk.      --Congress of National Democratic Forces (KNDS)     Formed as a  coalition in August 1992 by the anti-Chornovil national democrats  (mainly the URP and DemPU), KNDS backs Kravchuk and puts  protection of Ukrainian independence above political and economic  reform. KNDS parties met on 3 November and scheduled a 19  December congress, which converted the coalition into an election  bloc and adopted an election platform (UNIAN, 4 November 1993;  UNIAR, 19 December 1993).      --New Ukraine     The parties belonging to New Ukraine--an  alliance of economic reformers based mostly in the russified east  Ukraine and cool both to Ukrainian nationalism and Kravchuk--also  set out to form an election bloc, but New Ukraine has been badly  divided and weakened.  The Social Democratic Party of Ukraine  quit New Ukraine in September (Holos Ukrainy, 21 September 1993),  and the Party of Democratic Revival of Ukraine (PDVU), one of the  biggest parties in New Ukraine and, according to PDVU leader  Taras Stetskiv, "the glue that keeps New Ukraine together" (Post-  Postup, 16-22 December 1993), began debating whether to remain in  the bloc (Ukraina Moloda, 22 October 1993; Post-Postup, 16-22  December 1993).  At New Ukraine's December congress, bloc leader  Volodymyr Hrynyov pointed to the defeat of Arkadiy Volskiy's  Civic Union in the Russian parliamentary election and warned that  New Ukraine could realistically expect to win only 20 seats in  new parliament (Demokratychna Ukraina, 25 December 1993).  As a  result, New Ukraine leaders began forming new blocs to use in the  election instead of or in addition to New Ukraine.      New Ukraine's Affiliates      In an attempt to broaden and strengthen New Ukraine's base,  Hrynyov, PDVU Chairman Volodymyr Filenko, and others decided to  set up a new bloc for the election, the "Democratic Center"  (Post-Postup, 16-22 December 1993).  Filenko explained that "when  it became obvious that New Ukraine was unprepared for the  elections, we decided to establish the Democratic Center, which  should become a new bloc of New Ukraine and PDVU" (Post-Postup,  16-22 December 1993).  The announcement of the creation of the  Democratic Center on 9 November was signed by 60 people from  various parties, including Filenko, Supreme Soviet member Taras  Stetskiv, Minister for Nationalities and Migration 0leksandr  Yemets, and sociologist Volodymyr Khmelko from the PDVU, DemPU  Chairman Volodymyr Yavorivskyy, and Labor Congress of Ukraine  head Anatoliy Matviyenko.  Reflecting the eastern and New Ukraine  origins of the Democratic Center, the signers included several  non-nationalistic Kharkivites (Hrynyov, Filenko, and Kharkiv  Mayor Yevhen Kushnaryov).  But the new organization also brought  in Lviv activists such as former Deputy Premier and Economy  Minister Viktor Pynzenyk, PDVU leader Stetskiv, and Supreme  Soviet member Ihor Hryniv (Holos Ukrainy, 29 December 1993).      Proclaiming a "centrist position," the Democratic Center platform  stressed economic reform and largely ignored nationalist themes.  Diverging from national democrats' stress on Ukrainian statehood  and independence, the platform, while condemning any "renewal of  the USSR," declared that "calls for immediate withdrawal from the  CIS do not consider harsh economic realities" (Holos Ukrainy, 29  December 1993).  The organizers did not invite Chornovil to join  (Khreshchatyk, 3 December 1993), and neither Rukh or URP joined  (Za Vilnu Ukrainu, 20 November 1993).  Chornovil for his part  said the new conference of democratic parties created in November  had no intention of merging with the Democratic Center (UNIAN, 12  November 1993).      Members of the Democratic Center group from Lviv--Stetskiv,  Pynzenyk, and Hryniv--joined with other Lviv politicians such as  former First Deputy Premier Ihor Yukhnovskyy, Supreme Soviet  member Mykhaylo Kosiv, and some other members of Rukh and the URP  to form a similar election coalition in their locality called  "New Wave" (Nova Khvylya) (Za Vilnu Ukrainu, 20 November 1993;  UNIAN, 30 November 1993; Ukraina Moloda, 30 November 1993; Kiev  Radio, 23 December 1993).  New Wave became a major factor in  Lviv, nominating some of the most prominent Lviv figures on its  ticket--Yukhnovskyy, Pynzenyk, and Hryniv (Za Vilnu Ukrainu, 12  January).  Rukh in effect also supported these three by not  running candidates against them (Vysokyy Zamok, 4 January).      In addition to creating the Democratic Center, in early December  New Ukraine Chairman Hrynyov joined with former Premier Leonid  Kuchma to form an "Interregional Bloc for Reforms" (MBR).  (Hrynyov's forming of a bloc with Kuchma brought criticism from  Filenko and Stetskiv (Khreshchatyk, 18 January) and questions  about how he can simultaneously lead three blocs, but Hrynyov  pledged to press ahead with all three (Post-Postup, 16-22  December 1993).)  Presenting themselves as an alternative to  Kravchuk and the nationalists, Hrynyov and Kuchma declared that  they had quit their posts of Supreme Soviet deputy chairman and  premier because the government and Supreme Soviet were blocking  reasonable economic policies (Nezavisimost, 10 December 1993).  They proclaimed support for reform, regional rights, and closer  partnership between Russia and Ukraine (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 8  December 1993; Izvestiya, 17 December 1993).      This alliance of two of Ukraine's most prominent politicians,  both popular in the heavily populated east Ukraine, raised a  potentially powerful new force in the parliamentary elections and  a significant threat to Kravchuk in the coming presidential  elections, where either Hrynyov or Kuchma may run.  Hrynyov and  Kuchma predicted their bloc could win 30-35 percent of the votes  (Izvestiya, 17 December 1993).  Kuchma has strong support among  industrialists and was elected president of the Ukrainian Union  of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs (Ukrainskyy Soyuz  Promyslovtsiv i Pidpryyemtsiv--USPP) at its December congress  (Demokratychna Ukraina, 11 December 1993).  Hrynyov was already  choosing candidates for the Supreme Soviet in his native Kharkiv  and neighboring Dnipropetrovsk and has strong support in business  and industry in the south as well as the east, according to a 16-  22 December Post-Postup article.      The Labor Congress of Ukraine (TKU) in December set up another  bloc, "Solidarity for Wellbeing and Progress," which is  apparently favorable to Kuchma, as is the TKU itself, whose  Dnipropetrovsk branch has nominated Kuchma for parliament (Kiev  radio, 14 January).  This bloc is also aimed at business and non-  nationalistic centrists with the objective of proposing "new  approaches to social policy" and their own approach to market  reform (Ukraina Moloda, 1 January).  The organizations joining  the Solidarity bloc--the Union of Leasers and Small Enterprises,  All-Ukrainian Association of Entrepreneurs, trade unions for air  line workers and geologists, and several other small  organizations--appeared similar to the ones that formed the TKU  itself in April 1993, suggesting that the bloc is simply a new  form of the TKU.  Like the TKU, the new bloc is centrist and  stresses private ownership and cooperation with Russia (Kiev  radio, 14 January).      Competition for Hrynyov and Kuchma      A group of businessmen and managers, the same constituency looked  to by Kuchma and Hrynyov, spurred the creation of a potential  rival bloc, "Hromada," at about the same time as Kuchma and  Hrynyov formed their bloc.  In contrast to the Kuchma-Hrynyov  bloc, Hromada appears more favorable to Kravchuk.  A founding  congress of the "All-Ukrainian Association 'Society'" (Hromada or  VOH) was held on 8 December, attended by a number of bankers and  entrepreneurs (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 8 December; Segodnya, 15  December 1993) and uniting, in the words of delegates, "former  middle level Soviet economic nomenklatura" who have invested  their capital in industry, "have something to lose," and want a  party to represent their interests (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 11  December 1993).  According to the 11 December Nezavisimaya  Gazeta, the bloc was organized by Oleksandr Turchynov and Serhiy  Lylyk, former Kuchma advisers.  They were named councillors to  Premier Kuchma in June (Uryadovyy Kuryer, 8 June, 24 June 1993)  but left the government in December (Uryadovyy Kuryer, 23  December 1993), following Kuchma's September resignation.  Lylyk  also was vice president of the Confederation of Enterprise  Organizations "Ukraine-West" and one of New Ukraine's leaders  (Holos Ukrainy, 30 June 1992).  According to Turchynov, however,  Hromada has "nothing in common" with the Kuchma-Hrynyov bloc  (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 11 December 1993).  Although Turchynov,  according to the 11 December Nezavisimaya Gazeta, stressed that  Hromada is in opposition to the government, the 8 December  Demokratychna Ukraina reported that he said the bloc would  support Kravchuk.  Further suggesting ties between Hromada and  the government, the 15 December Segodnya reported that the  government had paid the rent for the hall where the bloc met.      Leftists Attempt to Unite      Communist and socialist oriented parties have attempted to form a  united bloc for the elections but have succeeded in coordinating  their activities only in some regions.  Communist Party (KPU)  First Secretary Petro Symonenko at a 12 October press conference  said his party may establish an election bloc with the Socialists  (SPU), Peasant Party of Ukraine (SelPU), and Party of Social  Justice and perhaps in the future with the Party of Labor (Post-  Postup, 13 October 1993).  At the December SPU congress, the SPU,  KPU, and SelPU signed a statement of intent to cooperate  (Khreshchatyk, 28 December 1993), but the SPU and KPU clashed  over nominations and the SPU decided to avoid any national  coalition (Khreshchatyk, 11 January 1994).  The two parties have  been able to unite only in some regions (Segodnya, 15 December  1993).  In Odessa, 14 communist and allied leftist organizations  formed a coordinating council, but the council split over some  candidates (UNIAN, 10 January).  KPU Deputy Chairman Yevhen  Marmazov declared that his party will not form a bloc with  anyone, "but all of us--the Socialist, Communist, and Peasant  Parties--will assist each other" (Post-Postup, 30 December-5  January).      Little Cooperation Among Ultranationalists      Ultranationalists have not appeared to make great attempts to  form blocs with like-minded extremists, even in the nationalist  center of Lviv.  Stepan Khmara's Ukrainian Conservative  Republican Party (UKRP) nominated 9 candidates in Lviv's 23  districts.  UKRP backed some candidates of the ultranationalist  Ukrainian National Assembly (including UNA Chairman Yuriy  Shukhevych), one Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists (KUN)  candidate, Irina Kalinets, and one Rukh candidate, Dmitriy  Chobit, for other Lviv seats (Za Vilnu Ukrainu, 5 January;  Vysokyy Zamok, 6 January).  Pravda Ukrainy on 6 January reported  that KUN had declared its intention of running candidates for all  seats, backing away from forming joint lists with Rukh and other  democratic parties.  (KUN, unlike other ultranationalist parties,  had signed the October agreement to coordinate with democratic  parties.)  KUN announced candidates for 15 of Lviv's 23  districts, although it did back 3 candidates of other parties,  including Rukh (Za Vilnu Ukrainu, 4 January).      Efforts to Coordinate Nominations      As nominations of candidates began in early January, (According  to the election law, nominations begin 90 days before the  election (i.e., in late December) and end 60 days before the  election (26 January) and candidates need to gather 300  signatures (Vidomosti, 30 November 1993).) democratic parties'  efforts to coordinate, beset by much friction, appeared to  succeed in at least some cases, even though parties announced  their slates of candidates for most seats.  No national alliances  have been formed and various parties and blocs have united behind  some candidates in various districts, producing a variety of  combinations and suggesting that the result will be a  kaleidoscope of multiple party labels.      Rukh, as the largest democratic party, appears torn between  trying to field its own candidates in all districts and trying to  cooperate with its rivals in the URP and DemPU.  At an early  January session of the democratic parties' committee to  coordinate lists of candidates, chaired by Chornovil rival  Lukyanenko, Rukh was accused of violating agreements to  coordinate by running its own slates in some areas, especially  Kharkiv.  Rukh's Ivan Zayets justified Rukh's actions on grounds  that other parties were too slow in deciding where to nominate  candidates (UNIAR, 4 January).  According to another account,  Lukyanenko complained that in Kherson 23 democratic organizations  had united in a bloc but Rukh stayed out and he accused Rukh of  intending to nominate candidates in all 450 Ukrainian districts.  Rukh representatives responded that in Kherson the democratic  organizations had united in support of Kravchuk and the local  state administration--a position Rukh could not accept (Molod  Ukrainy, 11 January).      Nevertheless, Rukh has apparently taken a number of steps to  coordinate, agreeing to support a candidate from another party in  some districts.  Rukh leader Les Tanyuk dropped out of a race in  a Kiev district to give a clear field to a URP candidate and was  nominated by Rukh for a Lviv seat, even though he is from Kiev  (Za Vilnu Ukrainu, 4 January).  Lviv Rukh Chairman Yuriy  Klyuchkovskiy said at the Lviv Rukh conference that Rukh had made  concessions to other parties, especially the URP, by not running  candidates in 5 districts, citing as an example Rukh's not  fielding a candidate against Lviv URP Chairman Oleh Pavlyshyn.  But, he complained, URP had not responded in kind and had gone  ahead and run a candidate against Lviv Rukh Chairman  Klyuchkovskyy in his district (Vysokyy Zamok, 4 January).  The  Rukh conference had had to fight to block one of its members, a  member of the present Supreme Soviet, from running againt  Pavlyshyn (Vysokyy Zamok, Za Vilnu Ukrainu, 4 January).  Rukh  also ran no candidates against New Wave's Pynzenyk and Ihor  Hryniv, nominated New Wave's Yukhnovskyy on the Rukh ticket  (Vysokyy Zamok, 11 January), and ran no one against URP Chairman  Mykhaylo Horyn (Vysokyy Zamok, 4, 13 January).  At the same time,  however, Rukh ran candidates for Lviv's other 18 districts  (Vysokyy Zamok, 4 January).      Regional Variances      The success of coordination varies widely across Ukraine.  Democrats are having some success in uniting in Lviv, but their  foes seem more successful in forming blocs in Kharkiv, while  Donetsk appears to be a general free-for-all.      --Lviv     The national democratic parties are having some  success in coordinating in Lviv, although they are likely to win  all seats in this nationalistic center anyway, as they did in the  1990 parliamentary election.  Rukh, URP, New Wave, and possibly  some ultranationalist candidates appear likely to split up the  Lviv seats, in part by cooperating and in part by open  competition.  After "tough negotiations" among democratic parties  in Lviv's "political consultative council," according to the 28  December Vysokyy Zamok, agreement was reached on common  candidates in several districts, mainly between Rukh and URP--for  example, for wellknown candidates Yukhnovskyy, Pynzenyk, URP  Chairman Mykhaylo Horyn, and Lviv Oblast Soviet Chairman Mykola  Horyn.  New Wave's Yukhnovskyy has the backing of Rukh and the  Ukrainian Peasant Democratic Party, as well as his own party, and  URP Chairman Horyn has the backing of the Ukrainian Peasant  Democratic Party and no opposition from Rukh.  Serhiy Plachynda's  Ukrainian Peasant Democratic Party announced 6 candidates in Lviv  but also announced it would back New Wave's Yukhnovskyy, URP's  Horyn, Rukh's Yaroslav Kendzior and Mykhaylo Kosiv, and UKRP's  Stepan Khmara (Vysokyy Zamok, 18 January).  Although the Lviv  Rukh and URP conferences chose slates of candidates covering most  districts, their leaders indicated that the two parties may later  alter these slates to further reduce mutual competition (Za Vilnu  Ukrainu, 4 January).      --Kharkiv     Parties have formed several blocs in Kharkiv,  according to a 2-8 December 1993 Post-Postup analysis.  The  Communists (KPU) and Socialists (SPU) have formed an election  bloc.  The Civil Congress and Party of Labor have formed a rival  bloc, which professes to be anti-communist and pro-market, but  all four parties have roughly similar views on other issues, are  financed by the official trade unions and Kharkiv Scientific-  Industrial Union, and occasionally cooperate.  Thus, the SPU,  KPU, and Party of Labor combined to back at least one candidate,  Viktor Chub, socialist head of the Kharkiv Union of Trade Unions.  The Social Democratic Party (SDPU), Liberal Democratic Party,  Christian Democrats, DemPU, and URP have formed a "Justice" bloc,  but this is quite weak, according to Post-Postup.  (Later, the  Liberal Democratic Party withdrew from the Justice bloc because a  plank on federalism was dropped from the bloc's platform,  according to UNIAR on 14 January).  New Ukraine should be an  important bloc in Kharkiv but has been weakened since the Social  Democratic Party and most of the Liberal Democratic Party quit,  leaving only the PDVU and part of the LDP in New Ukraine.      Rukh has not joined any bloc in Kharkiv and has been debating  whether to join with New Ukraine or with the URP and DemPU.  Rukh's opportunities to form a bloc have been hurt by personal  antagonism between the local URP-DemPU leaders and Rukh and by  the local New Ukraine's coolness toward joining with Rukh.  Another important party in Kharkiv, the Liberal Party, apparently  is going it alone.      --Donetsk     In Donetsk, where non-nationalistic, eastern  parties like the Liberal Party, KPU, and SPU are strong, there is  apparently little cooperation among parties.  The Party of Labor  and Party of Justice were organizing a joint election bloc, as  were the Civil Congress and Party of Slavic Unity, but the  Liberal Party intended to run candidates in all 47 districts and  the KPU also was aiming to do so (Pravda Ukrainy, 18 January).  Rukh had hoped to ally with labor unions in Donetsk to help it  win in local districts, but the democratic trade unions created  their own bloc--the Free Trade Unions of Ukraine--to run  candidates, leaving Rukh out in the cold (Ukraina Moloda, 28  December 1993).

Horyn          12,000        *Kievskiye Novosti on 19 November 1993 listed the 30 parties  registered at that time, along with the number of members claimed  and other data.  Parties are based in Kiev unless otherwise  indicated.      **OUN was registered after the November list, as the 31st party,  on 17 November (Kiev radio, 17 November; Demokratychna Ukraina,  24 November; Post-Postup, 27 December 1993).      ***Shlemko was replaced by R. Koval at a December congress (Holos  Ukrainy, 10 December 1993).      Implications      By preserving key features of the pre-reform electoral system-  -majority voting and nominations from unions, farms, and  factories--Kravchuk and other non-party-affiliated officials,  including most members of the Supreme Soviet, have significantly  raised the election odds in favor of the establishment, the  amorphous "party of power" that still runs most areas of Ukraine.  Locally well-known, but non-party, candidates backed by the  government, industrial and agricultural establishments and  President Kravchuk, Supreme Soviet Chairman Ivan Plyushch, and  acting Premier Yukhym Zvyahilskyy, having arranged nominations  from farms or factories, will probably win more seats than party  candidates, especially in rural areas where parties are little  developed.      The majoritarian system will-also favor large parties in areas  where they are most dominant, but it will likely significantly  penalize the democrats, who are more divided than the leftists.  Rukh and the KNDS should run well in the west and Kiev city, and  the Communists, Socialists, and the Party of Labor in the east,  south, and rural areas.  Competing for the same moderately pro-  reform constituency in the east, the Labor Congress of Ukraine,  Liberal Party, New Ukraine, the Kuchma-Hrynyov bloc, and the  Democratic Center could knock each other out in the first round  if they are not able to increase their cooperation.  If they fail  to achieve greater cooperation before the first round, democratic  groups may get a second chance to cooperate between the first  round and the runoffs, which will probably be necessary in many  districts, but the democratic vote could be so fractionalized in  some districts that no democrat survives for the runoff.

			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Ride on the big gripper Warning: do not mishear what is to follow. It may sound like another replay of that many-times discredited theme, 'Major rises; Tories resurgent.' It is not. On present form the Conservatives are headed for defeat at the general election of 1996 or 1997. Those of us who have twice or thrice made the mistake of writing up the prime minister or his party should have learnt the lesson by now. Mr John Major is still the least popular holder of his office in postwar memory. He is a weak leader of an unstable coalition of fundamentally opposed factions of the right and centre. He is, and may be doomed to remain, an object of national derision. Got it? Fine. Then let it be acknowledged that the prime minister, in free fall until a few months ago, seems to have reached firmish ground. This is not saying much. There was hardly a great deal of downwards direction in which to go. He is, however, a beneficiary of the first manifestation of progress, namely an absence of further deterioration. The government seems to have cured itself of the habit, so distressing to its practitioners, of knocking its head against a wall. One of its scathing internal critics, a senior minister who a few months ago expressed near-despair at the prime minister's floundering, and moaned aloud at his deficiencies as a leader, is saying that Mr Major is showing signs of 'grip'. Just a little, but it appears to be there. Grip is a magic word in Conservative circles. It means taking charge, making things happen, planning a strategy and sticking with it. Without it you are condemned to withdrawing everything you say, to a series of policy somersaults, to the sneers of the populace and a persistent hail of bad luck. Grip is what Lady Thatcher had until 1988. She lost it and within a couple of years she was out. Mr Major, if he ever had it, mislaid it in September 1992. As chancellor, he had the then prime minister enrol Britain in the exchange rate mechanism. On Black Wednesday sterling was ejected from the ERM. Mr Major's strategy was blown to pieces. Bye bye grip. It would be depressing to recount the history of the government's subsequent misfortunes. Just let us say that rarely has such humiliation been inflicted on so deserving a collection of individuals, giving such perverse pleasure to so many. This week the catcalls appear to be dying down. Fewer rotten tomatoes are being flung. It is no longer chic to barrack Mr Major and his government with quite the enthusiasm of the early spring. This change in the political mood needs some explanation, beyond the familiar list of reasons why each of the possible successors to the prime minister would be unsuitable or unlikely to challenge him. The principal factor is the apparent general acceptance of a multi-speed Europe, a notion elaborated by Mr Douglas Hurd. Moderate Euro-sceptics appear to have acquiesced in his wheeze. Using the Hurd formulation, sometimes called variable geometry, as a basis for anti-European rhetoric will not trigger a serious revolt by pro-Europeans so long as the foreign secretary himself, plus the chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke, and the trade and industry secretary, Mr Michael Heseltine, remain paid-up signatories. The Hurd concordat allows Mr Clarke to say that he favours monetary union, while Mr Michael Portillo asserts that he does not. Thus fortified, the cabinet (or nearly all of it) followed Mr Major into the streets to campaign in the elections to the European Parliament. The Conservatives lost badly, but not so horribly as forecast. The prime minister took his bows in the garden of No 10 Downing Street. It was an easy act to follow. Mr Major's loud rejection of the Franco-German candidate for presidency of the European Commission enhanced the impression that he was taking control, and won Lady Thatcher's ap-proval. At last night's meeting of backbenchers he exuded an air of confidence. Some say that he has passed through unendurably bad times and emerged the stronger for it. I'll believe this when he has kept it up for a year. He might. He may not have been born with grip, but grip is being thrust upon him. His next trick will be to reshuffle his cabinet. It was dotty to announce in the rose garden that all his ministers' jobs would be in danger for a few weeks, but that period is now drawing to a close. The long advance notice created an expectation that the changes will be substantial. They had better be, although it is hard to see in what way. If Mr Hurd postpones his retirement for another year, the great offices - foreign secretary, home secretary and chancellor - may well remain untouched, while Mr Heseltine will be difficult to dislodge from industry. If only lesser individuals are to be moved, Mr Major will have to demonstrate grip by shifting as many of them as possible. I have no idea what he will do. Some say that Mr David Hunt remains front-runner to replace Sir Norman Fowler as party chairman. That would release the Department of Employment, a cabinet newcomer's post that could suit Mr Stephen Dorrell. Mr Major needs to promote more Tory women. My favourite for education secretary is Mrs Gillian Shephard, who has a good track record in local education. She would be well placed to win both teachers' and parents' support for the national curriculum, testing and league tables, and unlikely to press for further opting-out. Her chair at agriculture could go to Mr Michael Portillo, who might enjoy debating the Common Agricultural Policy with his continental cousins. Baroness Blatch could take on the Department of Heritage in the Lords. Mrs Emma Nicholson could become minister for the disabled, and the Angelas Knight and Browning might profitably be moved up the lower slopes. Assuming that his reshuffle is successful, the prime minister may arrange for a summer of planned sequential departmental announcements of good news. The party conference in October will be Euro-sceptic and right-leaning, even if Mr Hunt is maestro. The Queen's speech is likely to contain few if any surprises. 'Consolidation' is the current demand. The November Budget will doubtless be hailed as 'steady as she goes'. If fate allows all this to proceed according to plan, Mr Major's precipitate descent into the abyss will truly have come to an end. But do note the health warning above.</p>

To make the sons of pigs taste the bitterness  of losing a dear one, to make them swim in their own blood."    Such were the words of a spokesman for the Fatah Hawks, an  armed gang in Gaza belonging to Yasir 'Arafat's Fatah faction of  the PLO, as reported in the LOS ANGELES TIMES on November 30.  The reference, of course, was to the Jews.    With the 13 Septembe signing of the Israel-PLO agreement,  one would have expected the Palestinians to at least moderate  the tone of their utterances. A look at the organization's  rhetoric since the handshake on the White House lawn, however,  reveals that it continues to wage a war of words against Israel.    The commander of PLO forces in Lebanon, Lieutenant Colonel.  Munir Miqdah, told a Reuters correspondent on 8 October, just  three weeks after the White House ceremony, "We will not lay  down our weapons until complete liberation...sooner or later we  will throw the Zionists into the sea."    The Voice of Palestine, broadcasting from Algiers on October  24, six weeks after the handshake, reported: "Yasir 'Arafat  stressed the continuation of the struggle until the Palestinian  flag is hoisted over Jerusalem's walls."    Perhaps the most surprising aspect of these statements is  that PLO spokesmen make no effort to hide their intentions  regarding the future. They continue to speak openly of  implementing the "phased plan" adopted by the Palestine National  Council in 1975 and calls for the elimination of Israel in  stages.    Indeed, Yasir 'Arafat himself, on 1 September, referred to  the phased plan on Radio Monte Carlo when he said that the  agreement with Israel, "will be a basis for an independent  Palestinian state in accordance with the Palestine National  Council resolution issued in 1974." He subsequently referred to  the phased plan on several other occasions as well.    Faysal al-Husayni, the senior PLO figure in Israel, has also  emphasized the phased plan repeatedly. Al-Husayni told the  BEIRUT TIMES on 16 September that, "Gradually, stage by stage,  we will reach an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as  the capital."    The frequency and forcefulness of these statements lead one  to conclude that the Palestinians have not put aside their  dreams of destroying Israel. In fact, they clearly indicate that  the agreement with Israel represents a change in the PLO's  tactics, but not its goals.    Al-Husayni himself admitted this in a speech to Bi'r Zayt  University on November 22, when he said, "Everything you see and  hear today is for tactical and strategic reasons. We have not  given up the rifle" (reported in MA'ARIV, 24 November).    Moreover, the PLO continues to resort to blatant  antisemitism  in its pronouncements. A leaflet distributed in Gaza by the  Fatah Hawks in November asserted, "We will continue our  rebellion against the governmnet of the dogs. We will escalate  our military attacks everywhere against the Zionists" (AP, 29  November).    In the lexicon of the PLO, Jews are "dogs and "sons of  pigs."  These can hardly be described as words of peace.    PLO spokesmen insist that the intifadah will continue. A  statement issued just two weeks ago by 'Arafat's Fatah faction  in Sidon said, "The revolution of stones is the only real face  of our struggle to put an end to the Zionist presence. The  intifadah is the Palestinian people's choice" (AFP, 18  November).    On 13 September, just hours after shaking Yitzhaq Rabin's  hand, 'Arafat gave a speech on Jordanian television in which he  said, "Palestine is only a stone's throw away for a small  Palestinian boy or girl."    Nothing has changed in the PLO's rhetoric--praise for the  intifadah, virulent antisemitism, talk of throwing the Zionists  into the sea. The political leadership in Israel is making a  grave mistake if it continues to ignore the PLO's pronouncement  on these matters.    True, actions speak louder than words. But these words are  loud and clear enough.</p>

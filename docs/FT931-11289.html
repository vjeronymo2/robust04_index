			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Germany halts new arms contracts as part of review MR Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister, yesterday announced a standstill on all new defence contracts, and the cancellation of plans to buy a DM3bn (Pounds 1.27bn) high-altitude US electronic reconnaissance system, as part of a total review of defence spending. He told the defence committee of the German Bundestag, the lower house of the parliament, that he had ordered the review, to be completed by the end of March or early April, in an effort to find substantial further savings in the defence budget. Cuts of DM860m must be made this year, and of DM700m a year from 1994 to 1996, to help pay for increased spending in east Germany. The minister said no contracts would be exempted from the review, including that for the redesigned European Fighter Aircraft, being built jointly with the UK, Italy and Spain. The move to freeze all contracts, which will also affect any existing spending plans containing review clauses, will endanger thousands of jobs in the German defence industry, according to an official of IG Metall, the engineering workers' union. He called on the government to produce a coherent concept for conversion of defence production into civilian manufacture. The cancellation of plans to buy the so-called Lapas aerial reconnaissance system, with some DM800m already spent on its development, is likely to cause a political backlash in the US. The electronic system is manufactured by E-Systems, of Greenville, Texas, while the high-altitude aircraft designed to carry it was being produced by a German company, Grob Luft und Raumfahrt, in Bavaria. Signature of the government-to-government contract for the system was abruptly called off by Mr Ruhe last month when it emerged that allegations of possible corruption were under investigation by the Bonn state prosecutor's office. Mr Max Streibl, prime minister of Bavaria, a former inspector of the Luftwaffe and two senior officials in the arms procurement division of the defence ministry have all been accused of taking free holidays at the expense of the Bavarian aircraft manufacturer. Mr Ruhe's move to freeze all new defence spending, and cancel the Lapas contract entirely, may for a while divert political attention from the charges. Mr Ruhe told the defence committee: 'We can no longer afford to take special account of domestic, or regional political, or economic factors.' Reduction in the personnel of the Bundeswehr would take longer to have a significant effect on budget spending, and so further cuts in equipment contracts must be instituted.</p>

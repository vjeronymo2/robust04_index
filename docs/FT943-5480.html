			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / International Company News: VW studies strategy for Portuguese joint venture Volkswagen is to draw up a new business plan aimed at improving the viability of its Dollars 2.8bn joint venture with Ford to build multi-purpose vehicles (MPVs) in Portugal, which goes on stream at the end of this year. The German vehicle maker, Europe's largest, is concerned that increasing competition in the van-like MPV sector, and adverse currency movements since the deal was signed in 1991, may make the plant less profitable. The factory is scheduled to make 190,000 MPVs a year in full production. The greenfield project, at Setubal, south of Lisbon, is the largest single foreign investment in Portugal. In full production, it is scheduled to employ 4,700 workers, and create indirectly up to another 10,000 jobs in the area. VW stressed last night there was no danger of it seeking to withdraw from or scale down the venture. The project is receiving Ecu750m (Dollars 619.8m) of EC development and training subsidies, and the Portuguese government regards it as its flagship foreign investment project. Ford of Europe, which is a 50 per cent partner with VW in the venture, last night described the Wolfsburg initiative as a 'routine' financial reassessment. It said Ford itself was not concerned about the project's viability. VW's managing board has been asked to come up with the plan in time for the supervisory board's next meeting, in November. The plant's vehicles will compete in one of the few sectors still enjoying rapid growth in Europe. Sales of multi-purpose vehicles have risen by an average 80 per cent a year since 1986, and are projected to reach 700,000 units a year by the end of the decade. However, every big vehicle maker in Europe is now planning to seek a share of this growth.</p>

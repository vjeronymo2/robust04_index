			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jose Arnada] </F>   [Text] The Secretariat of National Defense (Sedna), as part  of its modernization plan during this 6-year administration,  purchased from 1989 to June this year, 2,321 Hummer vehicles, 60  combat trucks, 1,307 diverse vehicles, 38 transportation and  training planes, as well as 26 riot units.    According to official information, in order to equip their  "operations with greater efficiency," the institution purchased  in 1993, 260 Hummers -- a purchase that caused a storm -- 1,471  vehicles, 549 machine guns, approximately 29,000 grenades of  diverse types, and 2,478 grenade launchers for automatic rifles.    In addition, to guarantee the timely supply of weapons to  the  Armed Forces and furnish support to its security forces, the  defense industry in 1993 manufactured 70.8 percent more  equipment than in 1992. A total of 1,725 automatic rifles, 164  machine guns, 1,640 light machine guns, and 3,390 automatic  pistols were manufactured.    The Armed Forces have earmarked a 5.493 billion-new-peso  budget. This amount is equal to the health sector's budget for  this year, although it is less than the Secretariat of National  Education's -- approximately 24 billion new pesos -- and that of  the Secretariat of Agriculture and Hydraulic Resources, with  approximately 11 billion pesos.    Sedna reported that the Weapons' Unification Program  achieved  "significant progress" in 1993 by incorporating the functional  reuse of rifles and light automatic rifles. This allowed the  weapons supply for operational units in Military Regions 2, 4,  5, 8, 9, and 10 to be supplemented.    In addition, the current updating of the Army and Air Forces  strategic plans has resulted in improved operational control and  coordination of the diverse territorial mandates and military  units. This includes air as well as land forces.    In 1993, the Army's regional deployment was reorganized with  the creation of the 37th Military Zone, the jurisdictional  restructuring of Military Region 1 and of the 1st and 22d  Military Zones. This has enhanced the operational coordination  of the units assigned to these zones.    According to the National Development Program, "the great  national tasks" require the participation of the Army, the Navy,  and the Air Force.    In addition to its "primary responsibility" -- the defense  of  the nation -- the Armed Forces must participate in the overall  development of the nation. This is accomplished by safeguarding  democratic institutions and protecting natural resources and the  strategic installations for security and the nation's economy.    The plan holds that in terms of political issues, the Army's  mission is to defend the principles of sovereignty and  nationalism, respect for liberty, support for democracy, the  rejection of intervention, and defense of the peoples' right to  self-determination.    With regard to the economic sector, it will support the  nation's overall development. In the social sector, the Army  will share the commitment to raise the people's level of  well-being.    The document highlights that for the Army "to accomplish its  missions with greater efficiency," permanent revamping of its  organization, equipment, and military capabilities will be  necessary.    When Antonio Riviello Bazan, national defense secretary,  recently referred to the purchase of military equipment, he  assured that the riot units and the Hummer vehicles had been  ordered "some time back." These, he said, will be used "solely  for defense," within the limits outlined by "the law on respect  for human rights."</p>

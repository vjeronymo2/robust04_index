			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / International Company News: Japanese corporations downgraded by Moody's THE senior ratings of Mitsubishi Corporation and Marubeni Corporation, the leading Japanese trading houses, were downgraded yesterday by Moody's Investors Service, the ratings agency. Moody's said both corporations took on extra risk through diversification programmes in the late 1980s. Mitsubishi's rating was lowered from Aa3 to A1, while that of Marubeni was downgraded from A2 to A3. This means both companies retain investment-grade ratings. But the downgrading may mean they face slightly higher costs in raising new funds. The downgrading of Mitsubishi comes as a surprise in Japan. Under the stewardship of Mr Shinroku Morohashi, its chairman, it is regarded as one of the country's most solid institutions, although net profits are expected to be halved for the year ending March. Moody's suggested its core trading business had been eroded through increased competition, prompting Mitsubishi to diversify into satellites, cable television, and a broad range of direct investments. Similar observations were made about Marubeni, though Moody's noted the downturn in international property had affected its development and construction businesses.</p>

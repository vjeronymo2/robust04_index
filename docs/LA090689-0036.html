			<p><P> September 6, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DENIAL OF INTERIM HILLSIDE DEVELOPMENT LIMITS URGED  </P> <P> A Los Angeles planning official has recommended disapproval of an emergency  measure that would restrict development on Sunland-Tujunga hillsides until the  community district plan is rewritten.  </P> <P> In a report to the Planning Commission, Hearing Officer Charles Rausch wrote  that the interim control ordinance is not necessary because only three  subdivision applications had been filed in the last 18 months for hillside  areas. Rausch also noted that no new applications have been filed since two  public hearings were held on the matter in June and July.  </P> <P> In addition, "there are adequate remedies in the current Municipal Code and in  the community plans to regulate subdivision design," Rausch wrote in his  report, which was issued last week. Rausch was unavailable for comment Tuesday.  </P> <P> But Arline De Sanctis, chief deputy to Councilman Joel Wachs, the ordinance's  sponsor, said existing measures do not go far enough in controlling growth in  an area that is increasingly popular with developers.  </P> <P> "This is one of the few areas in Los Angeles that has a wide expanse of  undeveloped territory," De Sanctis said. "The councilman's chief concern is to  limit the amount of new development in the hillsides of Sunland-Tujunga, to  keep them from looking like Burbank and Glendale."  </P> <P> De Sanctis said the proposed ordinance would limit hillside development on  slopes with a 15% grade or more. She said the measure is needed to adequately  control growth in the Sunland-Tujunga area until the community district plan is  rewritten, a process that could take from six months to a year.  </P> <P> Sylvia Gross, director of the Sunland-Tujunga Assn. of Residents, said she is  disappointed with the examiner's report and plans to write a letter to each of  the five members of the Planning Commission in protest.  </P> <P> "I think this stinks," Gross said. "Mr. Rausch doesn't acknowledge the fact  that over 5,000 residents signed a petition supporting" the proposed ordinance.  Gross has maintained that increased density on the hillsides could result in  flooding and mudslides.  </P> <P> The Planning Commission will consider the examiner's report at a public hearing  Sept. 14. The commission will submit recommendations to the City Council, which  will make the final decision.  </P></p>

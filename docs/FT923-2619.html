			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Try declines to Pounds 380,000 MR HUGH TRY, chairman of Try Group, said yesterday he was pleased that pre-tax profits at the contractor and housebuilder had only declined from Pounds 501,000 to Pounds 380,000 in the six months to June 30, given the constraints on the sector. Overhead reduction has been swingeing. About 25 per cent of the workforce has gone in the past year - 'well into the lean of the company', said Mr Try. He said there was very little new work on architects' drawing-boards, but that there were 'opportunities available even during a recession'. Try has had some success acquiring sites, contracting business and indeed contracts from the receiver. Margins could be better on those unfinished sites or projects of failed builders or contractors, Mr Try said. Work gained this way now accounts for about 15 per cent of Try's turnover, which rose 10 per cent to Pounds 63.1m (Pounds 57.2m) as several large contracts reached their final stages. In August 1991 it raised about Pounds 8m through a rights issue to buy housebuilding sites from the receiver of Egerton Trust and more recently it acquired a partially completed block of flats in Gravesend, Kent. At the end of last year, it bought Arnold &amp; Nathan, the contracting business, and has acquired contracts for an office block and a leisure complex from Swindon-based Isis. The interest charge was Pounds 275,000; last time there was a credit of Pounds 385,000 because of the banked proceeds of the rights before the Egerton buy. Earnings fell to 0.73p (2.28p) per share and the interim dividend is cut to 0.5p (2p).</p>

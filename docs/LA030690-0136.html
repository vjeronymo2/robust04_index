			<p><P> March 6, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SERVICES PLANNED FOR CAL STATE FULLERTON PROF. FLOYD THOMAS, 51  </P> <P> Memorial services are planned Thursday for Floyd W. Thomas, a Cal State  Fullerton engineering professor who died at home last week after an extended  illness. He was 51.  </P> <P> Thomas had suffered a brain tumor several years ago that continued to affect  his health, university officials said Monday.  </P> <P> He returned to teach classes in the fall semester last year, but poor health  forced him to resign, university spokesman Jerry Keating said.  </P> <P> Thomas joined the university as a part-time lecturer in mechanical engineering  in 1968 and was appointed to a full-time professorship a year later. He earned  his bachelor's degree at the University of South Carolina and his master's and  doctoral degrees from North Carolina State University.  </P> <P> Keating said Thomas was respected by students and faculty members: "He was a  very caring person who not only emphasized good teaching but good interaction  with students. He was known by his colleagues as being good at getting things  done."  </P> <P> Besides serving in several administrative posts, Thomas was an active member of  the Academic Senate. Keating said that Thomas also started the Minority/Women  Student Recruitment/Retention Program and other such projects.  </P> <P> "As a teacher, he developed many new programs and integrated computer usage  into many courses," Keating said.  </P> <P> Thomas is survived by his wife, Del, and a brother, Henry G. Thomas of  Columbia, S.C.  </P> <P> The memorial service will be conducted at 4 p.m. in Mackey Auditorium of the  Ruby Gerontology Center.  </P> <P> His wife has suggested that, in lieu of flowers, contributions be made to a  scholarship fund for mechanical engineering students established in Thomas'  name by the CSUF Foundation.  </P></p>

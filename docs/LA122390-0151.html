			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAPERBACKS  </P> <P> RUNNING IN THE FAMILY by Michael Ondaatje (Penguin: $6.95). A noted poet,  novelist and film writer, Michael Ondaatje has compiled a series of brief  sketches describing the antics of his dotty relatives in Ceylon during the '20s  and '30s.  </P> <P> Although both sides of his family had been prominent in Ceylonese society for  generations, they all appear to have been as mad as hatters. Ondaatje describes  his father as a gentle, if ineffectual man -- until he went on one of his  periodic binges, when he would stop trains by brandishing his Army pistols in  the passenger cars, or by hiding naked in the tunnels. Near the end of her  riches-to-rags life, his grandmother had to be barred from public parks because  she insisted on picking the flowers and giving them away with the prodigal  generosity she had displayed during her wealthy youth. Funny and oddly  enchanting, Ondaatje's prose evokes a happier time in Ceylon, before ethnic  strife shattered the island's tranquil existence. Charles Solomon.  </P></p>

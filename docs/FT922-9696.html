			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Wary traders see signs of modest recovery THE HESITANT twitchings of life in high streets across the country since the general election have been encouraged by yesterday's cut in interest rates. Mr James May, director-general of the British Retail Consortium, which represents nine tenths of the retail sector, sees modest recovery in most sectors.

Mr Terry Maher, chief executive of Pentos, which runs Dillons bookshops and Ryman stationery shops, predicts only an 'anaemic' recovery. 'People's confidence has been shattered and that does not change suddenly or dramatically,' he says. 'In my view there is nothing more important than that interest rates are now brought down as rapidly as possible.

It is vitally important that interest rate cuts are sustainable and sustained.' That largely depends on what happens elsewhere in Europe. As Mr Derek Bowden, media director at the Saatchi &amp; Saatchi advertising agency, says: 'Until the German economy has fully resolved its problems, this does not herald a significant move for the UK economy.'</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by correspondent Chen Xiaojie (7115 2556 2638): </F> "State Statistics Bureau Sampling Survey of 35 Large and  Medium-Sized Cities Revealed: Actual Income of Urban Residents  Has Increased by a Large Margin"]    [Text] According to a sampling survey of urban households  in 35 large and medium-sized cities conducted by the State  Statistics Bureau, the incomes and consumption expenditure of  urban residents in 1993 has increased by a large margin. Both  their actual incomes as well as the level of their consumption  has risen, but regional differences in people's incomes have  been very large, and the range of residents with reduced incomes  has broadened.    Urban residents' living expenditure incomes have shown  actual  increases of 10 percent. According to statistics, urban  households of 35 large and medium-sized cities had per capita an  average of 3,227.6 yuan available for themselves, 31 percent  more than in the preceding year. The per-capita living  expenditure income was 2,998.3 yuan, 31.5 percent more than in  the preceding year. Deducting the inflation factor for the said  period, the actual increases would be 9.4 and 10 percent,  respectively. Although the average per-capita increase of living  expenditure incomes was 7.8 percentage points higher than in the  preceding year, the actual increase was somewhat lower, if the  inflation factor is taken into consideration.    There are very evident changes in the structure of  residents'  incomes. The main characteristics of such are:    1) Incomes from salaries and wages are still in dominant  position. Per-capita income of urban residents from salaries and  wages in 35 large and medium-sized cities in 1993 was 2,092.6  yuan, 24.1 percent more than in the preceding year. In this  increase, bonuses with allowances and subsidies had increased 41  and 38 percent, respectively; they had been the main factors for  increases in salaries and wages. The proportion of income from  salaries and wages in the residents' living expenditure incomes  had declined to 69.8 percent from the preceding year's 73.9  percent, a decline of four percentage points.    2) Incomes other than from salaries and wages had steeply  increased. Such other incomes that staff and workers received  from their units had increased 40.8 percent, compared to the  preceding year. Net incomes of self-employed workers had risen  48 percent; other labor incomes of residents had increased 68  percent.    3) Incomes of staff and workers in three kinds of  foreign-funded enterprises and in other ownership systems had  increased by a large margin; staff and workers had per capita an  average of 88 percent more income available to themselves than  in the preceding year.    Very large increases were registered in the three cities of  Ningbo, Shanghai, and Beijing, showing up the existence of large  regional disparities. According to statistics, increases of  per-capita living expenditure incomes in the three cities of  Ningbo, Shanghai, and Beijing had been 51.2, 42.8, and 39.4  percent, respectively, compared to the preceding year. They are  the highest among the 35 large and medium-sized cities surveyed.  Of cities with 30 percent or higher increases in incomes there  were also: Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Haikou, Hangzhou, Nanjing,  Jinan, Wuhan, Changsha, and Nanning. Per-capita living  expenditure income of the residents of Shenzhen reached 7,070.5  yuan, which places this city at the head of all the 35 large and  medium-sized cities, with Guangzhou in second place with 4,984.4  yuan average per-capita living expenditure income. Average  per-capita living expenditure income in the eastern coastal  cities was by 26.3 percent higher than the average for all the  35 large and medium-sized cities; this ratio had further  widened, as compared with the preceding year.    Consumption expenditure of the urban residents is  continuously rising, while the consumption structure is  essentially remaining stable. According to statistics, average  per-capita consumption expenditure in the 35 large and  medium-sized cities during 1993 was 2,746.3 yuan, 30.4 percent  more than in the preceding year. Deducting the inflation factor,  the actual increase was 9 percent. Conditions of the various  expenditure items in this category were:    1) Consumption of foodstuffs increased steadily, but  consumption volume of some declined. Average per-capita  expenditure for foodstuffs was 1,397.4 yuan, 22.9 percent more  than in the preceding year, but deducting the inflation factor,  the actual level of consumption had risen only 3.1 percent.  Expenditure for foodstuffs accounted for 50.9 percent of total  expenditure, a decline of three percentage points, as compared  with the preceding year.    2) Clothing expenditure had increased, and more of the  higher  quality clothing was bought. The residents' average per-capita  expenditure for clothing was 376.2 yuan, and after deducting the  inflation factor this was 19.1 percent more than in the  preceding year.    3) Expenditure for household equipment and appliances, and  expenditure for cultural and recreational purposes, showed a  fairly strong rising trend. In the 35 large and medium-sized  cities during 1993, the average per-capita expenditure by the  citizens on such equipment, household goods, and services was  240.2 yuan, an increase of 33 percent over that of the preceding  year. The average per-capita expenditure for articles for  cultural and recreational purposes was 244.7 yuan, an increase  of 36.5 percent. Average per-capita increases were registered in  the following durable consumer goods purchases: purchases of  washing machines increased 36.5 percent; purchases of air  conditioners increased 1.5 times over; purchases of composite  audio sets [zu he yin xiang 4809 0678 7299 0742] increased 14.3  percent; and purchases of color TV sets increased 1.3 percent.    Up to the end of 1993, among the possessions in every 100  households in the 35 large and medium-sized cities were: 91.1  sets of color TV sets, 82.4 electric refrigerators, 90.1 washing  machines, 44 photo cameras, 8.5 sets of composite audio sets,  25.6 tape recorders [lu fang xiang ji 6922 2397 4161 2623].    4) Housing expenses had rapidly increased, while housing  conditions had continuously improved. Since 1993, the nationwide  housing reform had been forcefully pushed forward, and housing  conditions for residents have gradually improved. According to  statistics, per-capita expenditure for the purchase or  construction of housing has increased 2.2-fold, compared to the  preceding year. Per-capita expenditure on furniture and fittings  of houses was 15.8 yuan, an increase of 287.3 percent over the  preceding year. Because measures of the housing reform have  gradually been implemented, housing expenditure of the residents  has increased. Per-capita rent, with water, electricity, and  fuel added, amounted to 148 yuan, an increase of 36.6 percent  over the preceding year and accounting for 5.4 percent of the  residents' consumption expenditure.    5) Individual expenditure for sundry commodities and  services  has increased at a large margin, and the quality of life has  been improved.    Because the quality of life of urban residents has  continuously been improved, expenditure used by the individual  resident has continuously increased. Average per-capita  individual expenditure in the 35 large and medium-sized cities  in 1993 was [number indistinct] yuan, an increase of 30 percent  over the preceding year. In this expenditure an average of 26  percent more was spent on gold, silver, and other jewelry, and  44 percent more on cosmetics. In Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Shanghai,  and Xiamen average individual expenditure was more than [number  indistinct] yuan, which was the most among all the 35 cities  surveyed.    Statistic data also reveal that the income levels of urban  households have gone up. Considering the effects of commodity  price inflation, unemployment, and population increases, actual  incomes of some parts of the population have declined. The  extent of declining incomes reached 30 percent, which is 5  percentage points more than in the preceding year.</p>

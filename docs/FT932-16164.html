			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Letter: Don't shoot the economic modellers Sir, Your report ('Treasury economic model may be run by US group', April 6) that 'a key element' of preparing the Treasury's forecast could be contracted out to DRI, the American economic forecasting company, does not specify what that element might be. The implication, however, is that the element in question is the maintenance of the Treasury model. Under the Industry Act 1975, the Treasury is required to 'keep an economic model'. This is not a 'secretive process', as you say; under the requirements of the act, the model is publicly available. It is used by outside forecasters, and is independently tested and compared with the other main economic models by the Warwick University Macroeconomic Modelling Bureau. Furthermore, the model clearly pointed to the need for continuing increases in interest rates, as well as tax increases, following the stock exchange crash in 1987, instead of the folly which has cost us so dear. Despite ill-informed press criticism, economic modelling practices in the UK are in most respects technically well ahead of those in the US. The econometric modelling methods developed by Professor David Hendry of Nuffield College, Oxford, are used by the Federal Reserve Board, which within the US is more advanced than DRI. The chancellor of the exchequer wrote to me on March 3 saying that 'there are no plans for the Treasury to give up economic forecasting'. Although using models built by others is better than nothing, it is no substitute for an organisation maintaining its own model. Without that there is no way of judging the weight of evidence behind the particular assumptions made. For example, currently the Treasury model is doggedly sticking to its finding that there has been no improvement in the underlying trend of Britain's exports of manufactures, although the National Institute of Economic and Social Research found a reversal of trend, which it has now rationalised by a shift in the composition of export markets towards faster growing sectors. The chancellor can ignore the evidence of his own career officials, but he would be silly to shoot the modellers. Jeremy Bray, House of Commons, London SW1A 0AA</p>

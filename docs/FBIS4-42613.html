			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Internal Solidarity"] </F>   [Text] "An adequate retirement pension is one of the basics  of a modern welfare state," states the election program of the  Christian Social People's Party [CSV]. One remembers that, in  the last election campaign, i.e. in 1989, old-age pension was  one of the main issues. Which explains why a newly formed party  claiming greater pension fairness to be at the top of its agenda  could win four parliamentary seats right away.    In the meantime a lot has changed in that field, and the  retirement pension has received a powerful stimulus.    Although two parallel pension systems still exist in  Luxemburg, a contributive and a non-contributive one, and while  the abolition of this fundamental injustice, i.e. the division  of a country's citizens in two classes, has to be kept in mind,  the government that emerged from the 1989 elections has to be  praised for taking a number of steps in the direction of  harmonizing the two systems. In view of a further  reconciliation of the two pension systems, for example, the  contribution limit was raised to five times the amount of the  minimum wage.    Retirement pensions have indeed been improved. There is more  pension fairness today. The retirement benefits of the civil  service and the private sector have structurally moved towards  each other, in part because not all wage elements in the civil  service were passed on to the retirees, and private  supplementary insurances were made tax-deductible. The CSV  wants to have these measures put into law.    While the act of 22 December 1989 regulated the transition  between contributory and non-contributory pension systems, the  Pension Improvement Act of 24 April 1990 implemented the goal  laid out in the administration's program: to achieve more  pension fairness and a gradual adjustment to the  non-contributory retirement plan through structural improvements  of the contributory retirement insurance.    It must be mentioned that the fiscal reform realized by the  CSV in 1984 against much opposition created the basis for the  pension improvement.    The personal minimum retirement benefit rose between 1989  and  1994 from 26,167 Luxemburg francs [Lf] to Lf35,847; the minimum  widow's pension from Lf17,443 to Lf28,784. The average worker's  pension was raised by 50.4 percent between 1987 and 1994 from  Lf39,281 to Lf50,093; the average private employee's pension by  50.1 percent from Lf53,258 to Lf79,957; the average pension for  craftsmen and business people by 52 percent from Lf32,532 to  Lf49,433; and the average farmer's pension by 49.8 percent from  Lf25,781 to Lf38,626. In general, benefits were increased by 12  percent.    Several additional examples could be cited to prove that the  government, through the CSV impulse, has kept the promise of  more pension fairness it had made in the 1989 government  statement.    Thus the Christian-Social People's Party, upon whose  initiative all major welfare legislation was passed, can be  trusted when it promises in its election program that it will  continue to adjust pensions to the wage and price development  and that it will have retirement benefits and pensions converge  more strongly.    All the more after the CSV has given its welfare policy the  label of "Solidarity".    "We want more internal solidarity," states the CSV election  program. To implement a fair pension policy is basically no  more than real solidarity between the active portion of the  population and those people who, for decades, have given their  best for our country.</p>

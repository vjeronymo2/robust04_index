			<p><P> May 19, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AUSTRALIAN PUTS CITIZENS, EL CAMINO BANKS UP FOR SALE  </P> <P> Richard Pratt, the Australian industrialist who once planned on turning his  holdings in two Orange County banks into a $1-billion banking chain along the  Southern California coast, has instead put the banks up for sale.  </P> <P> Six to 10 institutions, including Wells Fargo Bank, are negotiating for the  acquisition of Citizens Bank of Costa Mesa and El Camino Bank in Anaheim, two  of the larger and well-operated banks in the county.  </P> <P> "We are carrying on detailed discussions with a short list of buyers," said  Eugene Schutt, president of the banks' holding company, Citizens Holdings in  Anaheim.  </P> <P> "But we don't expect that we will be reaching a final agreement with any party  for a number of weeks, and we don't expect a transaction to be closed before  December."  </P> <P> Schutt would not identify the prospective buyers, but other sources at the  banks confirmed that Wells Fargo and the New York leveraged buyout firm of  Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. are among the interested parties.  </P> <P> A spokeswoman for Wells Fargo declined to comment on possible acquisitions,  while officials at KKR could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> The possibility of a sale of the holding company has upset top managers at the  banks, who fear they would be laid off if the banks were sold to a major  financial institution such as Wells Fargo.  </P> <P> "Our feeling is we hope it doesn't happen," said Stanley Pawlowski, El Camino's  chairman. While Pawlowski could easily retire, other managers were planning on  staying longer. Richard Helstrom, for instance, was hired as president only  last fall.  </P> <P> Citizens Bank Chairman Paige V. Simpson, who was the architect of Citizens  Holdings' growth plan, speculated that top executives would stay if KKR or  another investor purchased the bank as part of a strategy to build a larger  banking enterprise.  </P> <P> Pratt had planned to acquire separately operated small banks from Long Beach to  the Mexican border and create a banking company with $1 billion in assets.  </P> <P> "Our overwhelming preference is for a new owner to carry on the same strategic  plan we started," Schutt said. Under one prospective deal, he said, Pratt would  remain a minority owner in the banking company.  </P> <P> Schutt said Citizens Holdings, owned through a maze of companies in a trust for  Pratt's three children, is one of the Pratt family's diversified investment  holdings. Schutt said Pratt's decision to sell the banks was made for  investment purposes.  </P> <P> "As an investor, we have a right to sell at an appropriate moment," said  Schutt, who oversees both Pratt family investments here and the Pratt Group  corrugated-paper production facilities in this country. "The value in the banks  is rock solid, and we have had a share in making them larger, stronger and more  valuable. We've been good shareholders."  </P> <P> Together, the banks had $269 million in assets at the end of December and  earned a combined $4.7 million last year.  </P> <P> Another reason why the Pratt family decided to sell the banks is because most  of its investments are located in the East.  </P> <P> Schutt, who was with Pratt's merchant bank in Hong Kong, came to Orange County  to head Citizens Holdings four years ago when Pratt acquired Citizens Bank for  about $12 million. Two years ago, the company launched its aggressive growth  effort by buying El Camino for $17.5 million.  </P> <P> But two other deals that same year -- for Eldorado Bank in Tustin and for  Rancho Santa Fe National Bank in San Diego County -- fell apart when new  federal regulations on bank holding companies made it economically unfeasible  to complete the deal.  </P> <P> Meantime, the Pratt Group acquired 200,000 acres of timberland, a plywood mill  and a paper mill near Macon, Ga. It sold the timberland and plywood mill to  concentrate on recycling paper products to make corrugated containers. It  recently built a paper mill in Indiana devoted strictly to recycling paper.  </P></p>

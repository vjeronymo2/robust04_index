			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 22 KYODO -- Former Foreign Minister  Michio Watanabe of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) said  Friday [22 April] that there will be no general election for the  House of Representatives before the fall of 1995. Watanabe was  speaking about the possible timing of a dissolution of the House  of Representatives and subsequent election at a general meeting  of Diet members belonging to his faction, the third largest  within the main opposition party.    The election "will not be called for a certain period," the  former deputy premier said, adding that "moves toward the  general balloting will surface after the fall of next year."    The veteran conservative politician was apparently referring  to the likelihood that a new government under Tsutomu Hata would  press ahead with Hata's proposal to contest the next general  vote under a new election system that combines single-seat  constituencies and proportional representation.    Heads of coalition parties on Friday picked Foreign Minister  Hata, who is head of the coalition's core party Shinseito [Japan  Renewal Party], as its candidate for the premiership. Hata, 58,  is almost certain to win the two elections to be held Monday in  plenary sessions of the House of Representatives and the House  of Councillors due to the coalition's majority.</p>

			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Rank makes Pounds 20m disposal BRIGHTREASONS, the group run by former Mecca boss Mr Michael Guthrie, is buying the Italian restaurant businesses, Pizza Piazza and Prima Pasta, from Rank Organisation for Pounds 20.25m in cash. The purchases bring two more Mecca businesses back under the control of Mr Guthrie, who set up Prima Pasta as part of the leisure company's restaurant business five years ago. Mr Guthrie left Mecca just before Rank's takeover in 1990. He paid Rank Pounds 90m for 11 motorway service stations in 1991. These are run as a separate company. Brightreasons, which is reportedly preparing for a flotation in the next two years, will pay an initial Pounds 19m, with Pounds 1.25m deferred to 1994. The payment will go a small way towards reducing Rank's onerous debt burden, which was Pounds 999.3m at the year-end. Mr Guthrie said the acquisition would complement the Pizzaland business purchased from Grand Metropolitan in 1991. He estimated that after the latest acquisitions, Brightreasons would have between 20 and 23 per cent of the pizza and pasta market in the UK.</p>

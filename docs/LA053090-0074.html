Reed urged a crowd of several thousand in Malden, Mass.,  to remember those still held captive in the Middle East as he spoke at a  homecoming celebration. He was joined by his wife and other relatives in front  of City Hall. Reed, 57, head of the Lebanese International School when gunmen  abducted him in 1986, said he was torn between the desire to stay close to home  and the urge to publicize the plights of the remaining 16 Western hostages.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> The Environmental Protection Agency will have 26 months to develop a plan under  which Ventura County can achieve compliance with federal clean air standards,  according to a proposed settlement between the EPA and an environmental group.  Citizens to Preserve the Ojai, a coalition of Ventura County environmentalists,  sued the agency last February to require enforcement of the federal Clean Air  Act in the county, whose ozone levels are ranked by the EPA as the fourth-worst  in the nation. The lawsuit was necessary because county officials had been  unable to develop a plan that would comply with federal standards, the  environmentalists said.  </P></p>

			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Political ground shifts under NZ main parties New Zealand's two main political parties have each entered a period of turmoil. Prospects of a political realignment have increased, following the general election earlier this month which saw the right-wing National party hang on to power by a one-seat majority. Mr David Lange, the former Labour party prime minister, said last night that an acrimonious brawl over the continued leadership of Mr Mike Moore, his successor, could wreck the party. The battle erupted within days of Mr Moore proclaiming that he had resurrected the party's fortunes by nearly winning the election. Many see the struggle as the first in a series of party wrangles which will prompt members of the two main parties to form new political groups. Politicians are seeking to take advantage of the introduction for the next election of the German proportional representation system, which favours the development of small parties, rather than the Westminster-style two-party system which New Zealand has had for much of the past 133 years. Divisions also exist within the National party amid speculation that a new hard-right party might be formed. Ms Ruth Richardson was toppled as finance minister by opponents within the party at the weekend. She has said she will not hesitate to vote against the government if it puts her economic policies at risk. The new finance minister, Mr Bill Birch, is a close ally of prime minister Jim Bolger. Mr Birch was the architect of many reforms introduced over the past three years including the Employment Contracts Act which has effectively broken the power of the unions and cut wage costs. The struggle within Labour between Ms Helen Clark, a left-leaning academic, and Mr Moore, a former trade unionist, has divided the party into two roughly equal factions. About half apparently want to follow Ms Clark, Mr Lange and others into turning Labour back to a centre-left group which is already pledging to raise taxes to help the under-privileged. Aligned against them are Labour MPs who supported economic reforms, as well as Maori MPs and a number of traditional union and other working-class Labour MPs. In a letter of support for Ms Clark, who is standing against Mr Moore in tomorrow's caucus vote for leadership, Mr Lange accused Mr Moore of campaigning as if the Labour party was his own property. 'He'd rather see the party wrecked than let caucus chose a new leader,' he said. The left wing argues that the party must refocus on its roots in order to survive under the proportional voting system; Mr Lange and others say the party must abandon the centrist approach favoured by Mr Moore of 'being all things to all men'. Mr Lange said on television last night that Labour could never govern on its own again.</p>

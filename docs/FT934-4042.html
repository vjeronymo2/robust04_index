			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Ward shares tumble on loss warning Shares in Ward Holdings fell 8p to 35p on Friday after the housebuilder and property group revealed that an exceptional provision in the results for the year to October 31 would force it into the red. In August the group said that it intended to review the value of its land bank and property assets at October 31. The review revealed that for certain residential land there was 'a substantial surplus over book amount', but that accounting conventions dictated that this could not be reflected in the figures for the year to October. The valuation also revealed that a provision was necessary against the book value of other residential land and industrial properties. This, along with other provisions, total Pounds 8.4m. Ward said that borrowings had continued to be paid down. At October 31 they were Pounds 9.8m (Pounds 30.6m).</p>

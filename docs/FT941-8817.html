			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / International Company News: Electricite de France increases profit by 24% Electricite de France, the state-owned utility, shrugged off the effects of recession to achieve net profits of FFr3.1bn (Dollars 526m) last year, an increase of 24 per cent over 1992. The results exclude a payment to the state, which is part of a four-year agreement, and which is estimated at about FFr1bn for last year. Sales rose by 3.5 per cent to FFr183.6bn, with a strong increase in exports of electricity. Mr Gilles Menage, chairman of EdF, said he expected only a slight increase in electricity rates this year, of the order of 0.5 per cent, below an expected inflation rate of just over 2 per cent. He described the limited increase which has to be confirmed by Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, as 'good news for the French consumer'. Investments were held constant at FFr32.9bn, but the company's cashflow strengthened and borrowings were reduced from FFr194.8bn to FFr176.5bn. Interest costs represented about 9.5 per cent of turnover, according to EdF.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Yerevan, Mar 4 (SNARK) -- Levon Zurabyan, the acting  press-secretary of the Armenia's president, refuted today  information of some mass media that Armenia "is going to use the  Azerbaijani territory occupied by Karabakh for burning  radioactive waste of the Armenian nuclear power station". He  called these rumors a propaganda trick.    In the interview to the SNARK reporter, Mr. Zurabyan  expressed an opinion that such rumors are spread out in order to  prevent renewing of the Armenian nuclear power station's work  and thereby not to allow Armenia to have an independent energy  source.    Meanwhile, as he pointed out, by spreading out, Azerbaijan  makes a vain attempt to prove that Armenia infringes on the  Azerbaijan's territory and even is going to use it for own  purposes.    Mr. Zurabyan said that absurdity of these statements is  obvious.</p>

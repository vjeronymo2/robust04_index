			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Toward Legal Protection for </F> Biotechnological Inventions in Europe"]    [Text] Brussels--Following a meeting of the twelve  ministers in charge of the EU [European Union] domestic market,  held on 16 December, the chairman of the meeting, Mr. Robert  Urbain, Belgian minister of European affairs, announced that the  twelve had agreed on legal protection for biotechnological  inventions within the Community. The draft directive (European  law) aims first of all to promote the competitiveness of EU  science and industry in the field of biotechnology.    "Because inventions could not be protected in Europe, recent  years saw a European brain drain toward areas where their  patents were better protected," Mr. Urbain pointed out. The  draft directive makes it possible to patent therapeutic methods  that modify the human genetic makeup, but it also establishes  the basic principle that the human body cannot be patented. "We  are not going to promote genetic engineering."    According to an expert, the objective is to pave the way for  methods which offer prospects of curing hundreds of diseases,  such as cystic fibrosis. It is understood that modifications  must be undertaken solely for therapeutic purposes and must be  fully consistent with human dignity.    According to a diplomatic source, Spain was opposed to all  methods that would lead to a modification of the human genetic  makeup. "But if such modifications are patentable, it does not  follow that they will be allowed," the Belgian minister also  pointed out. The draft directive must still be formally approved  by a ministers council before coming into force, by 1996 at the  latest.</p>

			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / School inspection plans condemned A STRONG attack on the government's plans for regular school inspections, a central feature of Mr John Major's Citizen's Charter, is made in a paper published today by the Centre for Policy Studies, the rightwing think tank. Dr Sheila Lawlor, the centre's deputy director, condemns the school inspection regime being established by the new Office for Standards in Education (Ofsted) as too prescriptive. She says it is biased in favour of 'progressive' teaching methods and their protagonists. Every state school is to be inspected at least once every four years under reforms carried through last year by Mr Kenneth Clarke, then education secretary. Private teams will carry out inspections but will be licensed by Ofsted, which will also be responsible for assigning inspectors to schools. Dr Lawlor condemns Ofsted's inspection guidelines as 'too detailed and prescriptive', requiring over-lengthy inspections - 33 days for secondary schools with fewer than 400 pupils, 57 days for those with more - covering too wide a field. 'Unless the basis on which inspection rests is radically different to that proposed, there is every danger that the new arrangements will perpetuate the worst of the old system and undermine the central task of the objective reporting of standards,' argues Dr Lawlor. She also criticises Ofsted's recruitment and training arrangements as likely to lead to an inspectorate dominated by the personnel and outlook of Her Majesty's Inspectorate, the national inspection body prior to Ofsted. 'The upshot will be to perpetuate the poor practices of HMI and local authorities in the past, in which emphasis is put on schools perpetuating favoured educational theories rather than on achieving the highest standards by whatever methods they choose,' she says. A General Teaching Council should be established in England and Wales 'to raise the morale of teachers and restore their standing more generally in society', according to a paper published today by the National Commission on Education, an independent think tank. The paper, by Mr Stuart Maclure, former editor of the Times Educational Supplement, says the powers of the council should include establishing a register of teachers and administering disciplinary procedures.

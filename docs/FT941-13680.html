			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / China softens stance on human rights after visit by Christopher China yesterday gave a further indication of its readiness to discuss human rights with the west by agreeing to receive a senior US government specialist on the issue in Beijing next month. Following a meeting between Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, and Mr Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister, in Paris yesterday, it was agreed that Mr John Shattuck, the US assistant secretary for human rights, would visit the Chinese capital to help Washington determine whether to renew most favoured nation trade treatment for China's exports. Mr Qichen said he did not believe the question of trade should be linked to that of human rights - as they are in US legislation - 'but we are ready to discuss all these issues'. US officials described yesterday's meeting, which also touched on the problem of North Korea's possible nuclear weapon ambitions, as constituting another step in the gradual improvement of Sino-American relations. More obliquely, Mr Edouard Balladur, France's prime minister, used a separate meeting yesterday with Mr Qichen to underline to the Chinese minister 'the need, in an increasingly unified world, for a certain relationship between general conceptions of human rights'. But, in its eagerness to make up for its recent exclusion from the Chinese market, France is far from making Beijing's human rights record a pre-condition for a better commercial relationship. Indeed, Mr Balladur who is to visit China in March, has agreed to Beijing's condition that France will sell no more offensive weapons to Taiwan, beyond its recent sales of Mirage jets and navy frigates.</p>

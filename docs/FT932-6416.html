			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Arts: Antony and Cleopatra - Theatre in London When Octavius Caesar is told of the death of Antony, he responds, 'The breaking of so great a thing Should make a greater crack,' then goes into hyperbole: 'The round world Should have shook lions into civil streets, And citizens to their dens.' Not in this production. The most you can expect to hear from the death of Richard Johnson's Antony is a dull thud as he slumps from his couch onto the floor, having forgotten where he put his sword. I disliked John Caird's direction when his Antony and Cleopatra was first shown at Stratford last autumn. It has not improved with time, nor with the greater space offered by the Barbican. The faults have become more glaring. The trouble is that there is nothing to show that this Antony either was or deserved to be a triple pillar of the world. He is an old man over the top, a curious mixture of Lear and Falstaff straying into the wrong play. There is nothing regal about Clare Higgins's Cleopatra either. She behaves, despite her age, which - given the number of her children and past experience - must be considerable, like an immature tart. She is not a queen of Egypt, unless you take the racist view that people who live on the southern side of the Mediterranean are somehow inferior. The production is not a compliment to Egyptian civilisation. Rome does not come off much better. In the scene where Lepidus is carried out drunk, the Romans look like past undergraduates reliving a boat night supper. The affair between Antony and Cleopatra is presented as run-of-the-mill adultery between an elderly man and a woman who is older than she looks. Antony is overweight and no longer cares about his dress. Cleopatra's clothes, except perhaps at her suicide, would not win prizes in a Paris or Italian salon. It is straight sexual infatuation from start to finish. Style is out. Does this matter? Yes, because it is against the text, which contains some of the finest poetry (poetry, not verse) that Shakespeare wrote. It is inconceivable that he would have given it to a pair of sluts. Johnson and Ms Higgins proceed by trying to pretend that the poetry does not exist. When Antony says 'The long day's task is done And we must sleep', one wonders what he has been doing in the meantime. Certainly any glory belonged to the period before the play began. Two performances stand out. One is Phyllida Hancock as Octavia. She at least shows that there is some dignity in Rome, whatever the rest of the Romans do. The other is Ken Christiansen as Mardian, the eunuch in the Egyptian court. At times he comforts the queen much in the way that the Fool comforts the king in the RSC's current production of King Lear. But it is an odd production of Antony and Cleopatra where the first prize goes to the eunuch. Go downstairs and see The Changeling at the Pit.</p>

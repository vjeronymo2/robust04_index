			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 28 (XINHUA) -- Premier Li Peng said  here today that Sino-French relations have entered a stage of  overall restoration and development.    The Chinese premier made the remarks while meeting the press  prior to his departure for an official three European nation  tour that will cover Austria, Germany and Romania.    Asked to comment on the prospects of the development of  Sino-  French relations, the premier said that he was personally  satisfied with the current state of development.    Earlier this year, China and France signed a memorandum on  the improvement of relations between the two countries. In  April, French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur paid a visit to  China, he recalled.    During his visit here, Prime Minister Balladur conveyed from  the French president an invitation to Chinese President Jiang  Zemin. At present, the two governments are discussing the  exchange of visits between the two countries' leaders, Li said.    On Sino-British links, Li noted that there are quite big  differences in the views of China and Britain on the Hong Kong  issue, so much as that they have affected the overall relations  between the two countries.    "But the responsibility does not lie with China," he  stressed.    Recalling his recent meeting with a British entrepreneur, Li  said China hopes that the economic and trade relations between  China and Britain would develop normally, but it is impossible  that such relations would not be affected by the political  relations between the two countries. "What we should do is to  try as far as possible to avoid the negative effect," he said.</p>

During the meeting, the Arab League delegation delivered to  brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid, the deputy chairman of the  Presidential Council, a letter from his brother, Dr. 'Ismat  'Abd-al-Majid, the Arab League secretary general, concerning  relations between our country and the Arab League, the situation  in Yemen, and the Arab League's efforts on behalf of Yemen.    At the beginning of the meeting, brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid,  welcomed the Arab League delegation and briefed it on  developments affecting the national arena and on the dangerous  military imbroglios it had experienced, particularly following  the signing of the document of pledge and accord. He briefed  them on the efforts made to contain and bring to an end those  imbroglios. He also stressed the need to bring about conditions  conducive to the implementation of the document of pledge and  accord inasmuch as this was a document of national consensus and  a new social charter to rectify the march towards unity and the  construction of the modern state.    Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid expressed his appreciation for the  attention the Arab League had paid to the state of affairs in  our country. He also expressed gratitude for the efforts being  made by Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid, which are an extension of the  efforts being made by friendly and fraternal states to help our  country overcome the present crisis and create conditions  conducive towards restoring stability on the road that leads  towards the building of a modern Yemen.    The Arab League delegation expressed the league's concern  over the developments affecting the Yemeni arena, its keenness  that the crisis be resolved, and that an end be put to the  imbroglios which brought it about. The delegation stressed that  the league was prepared to do everything it could to participate  in helping our country to resolve the problems it was  undergoing. This would enable it to strengthen security and  stability for itself and the peoples of the region thus  preserving the unity of the people and their national and  democratic options in building their modern democratic state.

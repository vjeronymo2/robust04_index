			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Aerostructures plans new profit warning Aerostructures Hamble, the aircraft components company, will warn today that its profits both this year and next will be well below its expectations when came to the stock market in June, because of a combination of production difficulties and order deferrals. The resignation of Mr Andrew Barr, Aerostructures' chief executive, who realised Pounds 1.74m from the sale of shares in the flotation, will also be announced. Mr Barr is understood to be unwell. He will be replaced temporarily by Mr David Ring, the commercial director, until a permanent replacement is found. In an attempt to placate shareholders, who are furious that no details of these problems were contained in the flotation prospectus, a precise timetable of when the financial difficulties came to light will be published. The company will say that non-executive directors, led by chairman Lord King, former British Airways chairman, had no knowledge of the problems until a board meeting in mid-September. The non-executives then informed NM Rothschild, the merchant bank which brought Aerostructures to the market. Rothschild passed the bad news to Aerostructures's auditors, Coopers &amp; Lybrand, its stockbrokers, Smith New Court, and Ashurst Morris Crisp, solicitors to the flotation. Shareholders were not told until September 21. Today's statement will say Aerostructures's executives first became aware of production difficulties in the middle of July, but the financial implications were not apparent to them. By the middle of August, they began to realise the difficulties could have an adverse effect on results. The delay of several weeks in informing the full board was a combination of 'bad luck and bad judgment', according to a company employee with a close knowledge of the report. However, Hamble's shareholders, led by Abbey Life and Henderson Administration, are likely to become even more angry when they learn that the company's prospects in 1995 have deteriorated, because substantial orders have been deferred. Although Aerostructures is expected to make a profit in 1994, the outlook for 1995 is understood to be less certain. The prospectus said 'market conditions' in 1994 were 'broadly similar to 1993'. It said action had been taken to make 'operational cost savings' so that profit margins would be better than in 1993. It said: 'Accordingly, the directors are confident about the prospects for the year'. There was also an optimistic statement about future growth. As a result, Rothschild is expecting to face a barrage of criticism from shareholders in coming weeks. Aerostructures was floated at 120p, valuing the company at Pounds 57m. Its share price, which fell sharply on September 21, closed yesterday at 59p. The quality of components supplied by Aerostructures had been a concern to British Aerospace, its biggest customer, since the late spring, according to defence executives with a close knowledge of both companies. BAe seconded several engineers to Aerostructures in May to try to rectify problems before they had an impact on BAe equipment. The difficulties proved worse than BAe initially expected. BAe now has 48 engineers at Hamble working on quality control problems affecting rear fuselages of Hawk and Harrier fighter aircraft, which Aerostructures makes for BAe. BAe has the capacity to take the manufacturing back to its own plant, but has decided not to do so.</p>

			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Currencies The currency markets appear to have lost patience with the Bundesbank's tough posture on interest rates. Yesterday's signal that rates will not be cut was immediately followed by concern for the industrial outlook. Having already cleaned up at the expense of sterling, foreign exchange traders are unlikely to risk their annual bonuses by aggressively gunning for the D-Mark before Christmas. But as the recent spate of issues in the Euromarket illustrate, investors have already started to vote with their feet. The French franc and Danish krona have already benefited from a weaker D-Mark and are out of the danger zone within the ERM. More remarkably, Italy's aspiration to rejoin the system by the year-end looks like more than wishful thinking. Having allowed the Italian currency to trade in a tight range against the D-Mark for the past three weeks, the market is already discounting such a move. Judging by the 5 percentage point difference between German and Italian short-term interest rates, though, the market will demand a hefty premium for holding lire even at a lower central rate. For this reason alone the UK government may feel vindicated in its decision to float sterling. But a softer D-Mark may not offer more room for manoeuvre. Sterling has so far notably failed to catch the coat tails of a rising dollar. Yesterday's PSBR figures are a reminder of the scale of the deficit which has to be financed next year. Sterling may have to fall further before overseas investors are tempted to buy gilts.</p>

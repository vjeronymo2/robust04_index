			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Morillon tries new tack in Srebrenica GENERAL Philippe Morillon, commander of United Nations forces in Bosnia, yesterday made a fresh attempt to break the humanitarian impasse in Srebrenica, by trying to station Canadian UN troops in the area. His efforts follow the refusal twice in the last few days of local Moslem commanders to allow convoys bringing in food and medicines to the besieged eastern Bosnian town from evacuating thousands of old and wounded people, women and children on their way back. The local Moslem leaders took their decision in spite of the suffering of the inhabitants of Srebrenica, whose population has swollen to 60,000 by refugees from nearby Serb-occupied areas, because they believe it contributes to the Serbs' policy of 'ethnic cleansing.' The Serbs make no secret of their desire to incorporate the Srebrenica region, which has been allocated by international mediators Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen to the Bosnian Moslems, into a Serb-dominated province. However, the Moslem officials have indicated that, if Srebrenica can be assured of UN protection in the guise of a Canadian 'blue helmets' unit, they would be prepared to allow the resumption of the UN's evacuation operation. An advance party of Canadian troops left its central Bosnian base yesterday, while the rest of the company, totalling 150 men, was due to arrive in Srebrenica today, the UN said. The Bosnian Serb army command had been informed of the mission, but had not yet given its reply. In Brussels meanwhile, the approval by Nato ambassadors of final plans for using alliance fighters to enforce the UN no-fly zone over Bosnia, hit a last-minute snag as a result of French concerns about the rules of engagement. French officials said France was anxious to make sure the no-fly zone was not enforced in such a provocative way that it drew everyone into a war. As a result, it is possible that final approval will be delayed until today or next week. In Sarajevo, snipers killed four civilians trying to cross the airport runway after Bosnian commanders failed to sign a safe passage deal reached with their Serb adversaries.</p>

			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Merseybus value surges to Pounds 10m Some 2,200 bus drivers and mechanics who bought their lossmaking company from Merseyside's passenger transport authority for only Pounds 1 as part of bus privatisation two years ago have learned that it is now worth about Pounds 10m. The latest assessment of the value of MTL Trust Holdings - known best as Merseybus - by Coopers &amp; Lybrand puts each share at Pounds 12.78. This means the average holding is worth nearly Pounds 4,000. The company - which has since become Britain's fifth largest bus operator - is owned by its employees. Losses were Pounds 8m on annual turnover of Pounds 50m shortly before its sale, when employees were given 250 shares worth 1p each, plus two extra shares for every year of service. Financial turnround has seen annual profits running at about Pounds 1m with Pounds 10m a year being spent on new buses. MTL bought London Northern, one of the 10 companies created to privatise London Transport's buses, for Pounds 20.5m in October.</p>

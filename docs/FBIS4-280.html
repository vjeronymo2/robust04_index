			<p>BFN     [Text] The ANC has strongly criticized the return to work  by two police generals.    The Democratic Party said the Goldstone Commission should  release specific evidence about their involvement in third force  activities. Lieutenants General Basie Smit and Johan le Roux  withdrew from their duties 10 days ago but resumed their duties  today. The commissioner of police, General Johan van der Merwe,  said their positions would be reviewed if new information was  received.    The ANC said it was unacceptable that police officers who  had  been implicated in alleged criminal activities should be allowed  to return to active duty until the allegations had been properly  investigated.    Earlier, Justice Richard Goldstone said that more  information  about the alleged involvement by policemen in third force  activities had been received by him and that the information  would be handed over to an international team of investigators.</p>

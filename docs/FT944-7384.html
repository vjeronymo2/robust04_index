			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Serbs take more ground as Nato squabbles Government forces defending the town of Bihac in north-west Bosnia said they had lost strategic ground to the Serbs last night as squabbling Nato countries put together a plan to stop the fighting in the embattled enclave. After a day of unexpectedly tough bargaining in Brussels, ambassadors from Nato's 16 members failed to agree on details of a blueprint to halt the Serb advance but referred the plan to the United Nations. Mr Robert Hunter, US ambassador to Nato, said the 16 allies were in broad agreement over a proposal to set up a 'stabilisation zone' around the town of Bihac, but details of the plan would have be worked out. 'We have asked the UN military authorities to tell us what the UN protection force (in Bosnia) might need,' he said, adding that it should be possible to protect the enclave under existing UN resolutions. However, Russia and China, both members of the UN security council, cautioned against western military intervention as Nato members haggled over the details of their peace proposal. Mr Haris Silajdzic, Bosnian prime minister, said the Serb attackers had taken the strategic hill of Debeljaca overlooking Bihac in fighting which intensified yesterday afternoon. 'They are attacking from all sides and the houses are burning,' said Mr Silajdzic, alleging that the Serb infantry were backed by tanks and artillery. Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, sharply criticised the Bosnian government. 'The Moslem side launched its latest offensive with the clear intention of involving Nato and other third forces in fighting on its side,' he said in Moscow. Mr Kozyrev said there could be no military solution to the Bosnian conflict, and outside intervention could result in a 'second Afghanistan or Vietnam'. The minister said next week's meeting of the contact group - of the US, Russia, Britain, France and Germany - must send a 'clear signal that the world community . . . favours a return to political methods' in Bosnia. China, whose approval will be necessary for any fresh UN resolutions on Bosnia, voiced 'deep concern' over events in Bosnia and insisted that western air power should be used to defend civilians or peacekeepers. In emergency talks in in Brussels, the US initially urged its allies to agree to create as wide as possible a zone round Bihac town where heavy weapons would be subject to air strikes. European members of Nato, led by France, suggested a more modest plan for a four-mile extension of the existing 'safe area'. The UN's contingent in the Bihac enclave is largely made up of 1,200 poorly armed Bangladeshis, resupplied by a UN convoy yesterday under agreement with the Serbs. The UN's vulnerability to any all-out confrontation with the Serbs was driven home yesterday when over 250 peacekeepers were detained in the Sarajevo area. The Bosnian Serbs on Wednesday blocked the peacekeepers at weapons collections sites round the exclusion zone ringing the Bosnian capital. It followed threats by Bosnian Serb leaders to wage an 'all-out war against the UN' in retaliation for ordering Nato air strikes. Allies fall out, Page 2</p>

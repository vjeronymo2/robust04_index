			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / Leading Article: Keeping London on the move TO STEP into a central London restaurant around noon these days is to be greeted with a forlorn sight: that of bored executives sitting unaccustomedly alone, picking at their bread rolls and sipping fizzy water. It is not that they cannot afford a decent meal. They have simply forgotten the extent to which recession has eased the traffic jams, and arrived embarrassingly early for lunch. It will not last. Recession may have tempered the demand for transport in London, but in due course an upturn will rekindle the lingering sense of crisis about the inadequacy of the capital's transport. If London is to maintain its international competitive position, the government needs to think urgently about how it is going to cope with the strains on its infrastructure. Unfortunately, it shows little inclination to do so. True, it has fulfilled its manifesto commitment to appoint a minister with special responsibility for London transport, but it turns out to have been a hollow gesture. The minister's role seems mainly to consist of being visible and well-intentioned: he lacks the budget, staff and powers to have any real clout, and strategy remains a dirty word. Thus, the government's policies for London are a hotch-potch. Car ownership in the capital is forecast to grow by nearly 50 per cent in less than 20 years, yet badly-needed investment in the public transport alternatives - suburban rail services, buses and the Underground - is being cut. Urban clearways, known as red routes, are planned to speed vehicles into central London, but there is no parking policy to deal with them once they get there. In theory, red routes should speed up buses, too, but the buses are to be privatised and deregulated, in all probability leading to the sort of free-for-all that has already brought disruption to some other British cities. Jubilee Line At least, the government can say, it has authorised construction of one public transport project: the Pounds 1.8bn Jubilee Line extension. But this decision, too, smacks of incoherence at a time when the government is cutting a third off the Pounds 750m-a-year investment budget for the rest of the Underground. While it is possible to make a case for the Jubilee Line scheme for the regenerative effect it will have on London's Docklands, it is less easy to do so if it means leaving the rest of the Underground to deteriorate into an ever-worsening state of decrepitude. It is the transport equivalent of adding a luxurious extension to a house that needs a new roof. Given the constraints on public spending, it is clear that any transport policy for London needs not only to be coherent, but to identify new ways of funding investment. One option is higher fares, but that would risk putting more traffic on the roads and raising labour costs. Besides, passengers alone should not be expected to meet the cost of the community-wide benefits conferred by good public transport, such as congestion relief, environmental gains and increased property values. Road pricing The logical alternative is to attempt to capture those community-wide benefits by other means. Until recently, two-thirds of London Transport's investment was paid for out of a levy on London rates, but the linkage was severed in 1990 to soften the introduction of the community charge. It now seems sensible to restore the connection, at least in the case of businesses. The Confederation of British Industry is today expected to urge more investment in the capital's transport. The government might test the CBI's resolve by asking its London members to make good London Transport's Pounds 250m investment shortfall with a 10 per cent transport levy on the uniform business rate. Ultimately, road pricing may offer a solution to London's transport problems by simultaneously suppressing traffic growth and yielding funds for transport investment. But London cannot afford to wait that long: it needs better transport now. The government has rejected the idea of London-wide political structures, preferring to exercise direct rule over the capital's affairs from Whitehall. It must now start generating confidence that it has an understanding of the capital's transport problems and face up to the responsibility for putting them right.</p>

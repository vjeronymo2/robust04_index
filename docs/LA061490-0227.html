			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> NEW AIDS TREATMENT TRIED AGAIN  </P> <P> A second AIDS patient today underwent a controversial blood-heating treatment  amid skepticism about the procedure's validity.  </P> <P> The patient, identified only as a 38-year-old man named Tony from Chicago,  underwent the two-hour procedure at Atlanta Hospital, officials said.  </P> <P> "The choice seemed rather simple to me. I had no other options available," the  patient said during an interview broadcast Wednesday on the Cable News Network.  "This provides a lot of hope for me."  </P> <P> The controversial AIDS procedure is called hyperthermia therapy and has been  studied as an experimental treatment for cancer.  </P> <P> Drs. Kenneth Alonso and William Logan performed the procedure the first time  Feb. 20 on Carl Crawford, 33. Crawford tested negative for the AIDS virus a  week after the hyperthermia therapy, and his blood remains AIDS-free three  months later, the doctors said.  </P></p>

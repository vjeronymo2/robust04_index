			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Zagreb, June 27 (TANJUG) -- Croatian Army Chief of  Staff Janko Bobetko said United Nations peacekeepers would be  expelled unless they help Zagreb to impose its rule in the  territory of the republic of Serb Krajina. The region became a  United Nations protected area in March 1992 after having earlier  declared independence from Croatia. The republic of Serb  Krajina's late 1991 declaration of independence followed  Croatia's secession from Yugoslavia and the removal of Serb  national rights from the Croatian Constitution.    Speaking in Sisak near the border with Serb Krajina, Gen.  Bobetko said Zagreb would expel the peacekeepers if they did not  help reintegrate the Krajina region into Croatia, the Croatian  press wrote Monday. "Croatia will in that case do it alone,"  said Bobetko.    Under a plan proposed by former U.N. envoy Cyrus Vance,  UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] forces were to remain in the  Krajina region until a political settlement was achieved between  Croatia and the republic of Serb Krajina. Croatia, which does  not recognize the Serb republic, considers the region "occupied  territory" and has attacked it in three offensives since March  1992.    Bobetko and Tomislav Mercep, a ruling Croatian Democratic  Union member of the Croatian Parliament, have announced plans  for a new offensive on the Serb republic. Mercep is the leader  of a Croatian paramiltary formation that has been accused by  Serb officials of committing numerous war crimes.    The Croatian press quoted Mercep as saying he would organize  Zagreb demonstrations in September by about 100,000 members of  the Croatian Army and police "ready to liberate all occupied  Croatian territories."    "If the Serbs refuse to accept Croatia's Constitution, I  will  personally issue an order to liberate Knin and so devastate it  that no two stones will be left standing on top of one another,"  said Mercep at a recent meeting in the Port of Pula.    During the 1991-1992 Croatian war of secession, Mercep led a  500- member special police unit that was reported to have killed  at least 2,500 Serb civilians in western Slavonia.</p>

			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Letter: Clinton volunteer youth corps plan an example for the UK Sir, Your report of President-elect Clinton's plan for a nationwide circulation volunteer corps ('Citizens corps to the rescue', January 4) raises the question: why not here too? Never before has Britain more needed youthful energy to tackle community care of the mentally ill and frail elderly; to assist health and social workers, crime prevention officers and youth leaders. At the same time we are wasting the energy and talents of more than 1m under-25s through mass unemployment, and building an alienated underclass. Also, student debt is so high that many talented teenagers are dropping out or eschewing higher education. An initiative which tackles four intractable problems at once deserves urgent consideration. However, our fear is that the compartmentalised shape of government cannot implement a solution to four different departments' problems: community care (Department of Health); youth unemployment (Department of Employment); crime (Home Office); and student debt (Department of Education). Perhaps the First Lord of the Treasury should act? Elisabeth Hoodless, executive director, CSV, 237 Pentonville Road, London N1 9NJ</p>

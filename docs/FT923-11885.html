			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Aids symptoms seen in patients without HIV A US scientist appealed yesterday to Aids doctors around the world to look out for people with the symptoms of Aids but no sign of HIV, the virus that normally causes the disease. Dr James Curran, director of the US Centres for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta, requested the details at the world Aids conference in Amsterdam so that scientists can determine whether a new virus is causing an Aids-like disease. About two dozen cases have emerged of people with the symptoms of Aids but no sign of the virus. If it is a different virus, or a mutation of HIV that existing techniques cannot detect, then new tests might be needed to protect the public blood supply from contamination. However, Dr James Allen, Aids programme director of the US National Institutes of Health, told a press conference after the session: 'What we have heard does not in any way threaten the safety of the blood supply in the US or in west European countries, that have systems to protect it from infectious agents.' Before the Amsterdam meeting started, Dr Curran knew of six people who had the severely depressed immune systems that characterise Aids but in whom scientists could find no trace of HIV, despite intensive testing with all known techniques. At an emergency conference session other US Aids specialists described cases in which they could detect none of the known strains of HIV. Dr David Ho, of the Aaron Diamond Foundation in New York, had 11 patients from New York and Los Angeles - mostly homosexual men - who had few immune cells and suffered from various secondary infections. Dr Jeffrey Laurence of Cornell University gave details of five patients from New York, four of whom had none of the usual risk factors for HIV infection such as multiple sexual partners or intravenous drug use. A few other doctors from the US and Europe said they had some patients who seemed to fit the same pattern. The emergency session was arranged after the US magazine Newsweek published an article questioning whether a new Aids virus was emerging. Dr Curran was attacked by some Aids specialists at the meeting for not taking the initiative and releasing details of the six patients studied by the CDC. But Dr Curran said the cases had not caused particular concern as they were not connected and did not suggest the early signs of a new epidemic, as the first reports of Aids in homosexual men had in 1981. He pointed out that the US had 250,000 cases of Aids in which HIV was present. Twelve experimental vaccines designed to protect people from HIV infection are producing encouraging results in small numbers of healthy volunteers, the world conference on Aids heard yesterday, writes Clive Cookson. The clinical trials show a wide range of different vaccines can raise some immunity to HIV, without side-effects. But none has yet been tested on large groups of high-risk people. Dr Daniel Hoth, director of the Aids division of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said it was time 'to prepare the infrastructure' for trials involving groups of 2,000-5,000 people, in developing and developed countries. These could start as soon as 1994/95.</p>

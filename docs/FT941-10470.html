			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Castle Cairn plans policy change Castle Cairn Investment Trust said it was proposing to change its investment policy to one of direct investment internationally in companies rather than through investment trusts. Direct investment would enable the investment manager to select investments on a more focused basis, it said. The change should result in the company being reclassified as an international capital growth trust.</p>

			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: A Crown servant's gilt complex I am a Crown servant employed overseas. As such, I am classed as non-resident for capital gains tax and on the interest paid on exempt gilts. What treatment is applied to income from exempt gilts in the tax year in which I return to the UK and resume normal tax status? Is tax levied for the entire tax year in question, or only after my return home? The existing exemption ceases from the day upon which you are regarded as having again become ordinarily resident in the UK. The position may be different if the gilts are held on the National Savings register, because of the quirky effects of the preceding-year basis (which is under review). Ask your tax office or Public Departments (Technical Unit) Foreign Section, Ty Glas, Llanishen, Cardiff, UK, CF4 5WN) for the free booklet IR20 - Residents and Non-residents: Liability to tax in the UK. The position could also be different if you hold 3 1/2 per cent War Loan (not in bearer form), or if any holdings produce less than Pounds 2.51 interest each half-year. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

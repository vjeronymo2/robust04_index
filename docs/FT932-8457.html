			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Reform splits party down the line THE DISCUSSION in the national executive committee today about the report from the Plant commission will mark a new phase in the Labour party's crab-like and sometimes almost imperceptible progress towards electoral reform. The reason for the party's caution is immediately apparent. Long-standing and deep divisions in Labour over electoral change were reflected even in the commission itself. Its decision in favour of the supplementary vote system, a limited form of proportional representation for electing MPs, was taken by just nine votes to seven. Among Labour MPs, those for and against electoral change are relatively evenly matched in terms of numbers. Neither groups is so small that it could be brushed aside. The Labour campaign for electoral reform has the open support of just over 60 MPs and the closet backing of others. The campaign launched yesterday by the defenders of the status quo - the parliamentary Labour first-past-the-post group - has signed up 86 MPs so far and believes it will be able to attract more than 100. The split in the party goes right to the top. Mr John Major, the prime minister, yesterday reminded the Commons that Mrs Margaret Beckett, the party's deputy leader, had commented last year that: 'Any move on electoral reform by Labour would be interpreted as defeatist'. The fightback by those in favour of the status quo was stepped up yesterday, with the launch of the new group which seeks to maintain the first-past-the-post system for all elections. It has pledged to take its campaign to the trade unions and to the constituency parties in the approach to the conference. It claims support from the party's MEPs. Mr Derek Fatchett, a junior frontbench spokesman and the group's chairman, said Labour's last election campaign faltered when the party started talking about constitutional issues and 'balanced government'. He warned that any move on electoral reform would be a distraction from what should be the priorities of a newly-elected Labour government and argued that it would be unfair in giving a disproportionate advantage to the Liberal Democrats. Against this background, the attractions of a referendum are obvious. Its potential disadvantage, in the embarrassing contrast between Labour's approach to PR and its resistance to a referendum on Maastricht, seems a small price to pay. Many of those on both sides of the argument could live with a referendum as the party conference decision, since each side believes it would win. Mr Fatchett said: 'We would be extremely confident of winning that referendum.' Mr Jeff Rooker, a leading Labour campaigner for electoral reform, was equally sanguine and said that he would not regard a referendum as a 'fudge'. 'The electoral system belongs to the British people, not to the politicians,' he said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 1 KYODO -- The Food Agency will relax  its restrictions on wheat imports to allow increased competition  in the area, agency sources said Friday [1 April]. The plan was  revealed following a news report that the agency sets import  shares for the trading companies through which it purchases rice  and wheat for the public.    The report said the agency informs the 26 designated trading  houses of their shares ahead of grain auctions, prompting grain  traders to collude on bids.    Eijiro Hata, minister of agriculture, forestry and  fisheries,  defended the government procedures for buying grain at a press  conference earlier in the day, while a Fair Trade Commission  (FTC) official said it would be a violation of the Antimonopoly  Law if the report is true.    Under the new agency plan for wheat imports, grain traders  will be allowed to buy foreign wheat exceeding their quotas by  up to 30 percent, instead of the 20 percent limit under current  restrictions.    The decision was made in response to an FTC request for  greater competition among wheat importers. Import ceilings for  exceeding quotas have gradually increased from 5 percent in 1960  to 10 percent in 1973, and 20 percent in 1990.    In a further bid to loosen its controls on the wheat trade,  the agency said it also invited prospective importers to be  added to the current government-authorized 26. So far no  traders have responded to the invitation, they said.</p>

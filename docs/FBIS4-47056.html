			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by KOMMERSANT-DAILY columnist Sergey </F> Tsekhmistrenko: "Chernomyrdin's Visit to China: First  Priority--Aircraft, Feather Beds Later"]    [Text] The days have long since disappeared when  Moscow and Beijing first swore eternal friendship, then just as  intently cursed one another as the bayonets of million-strong  armies bristled on both sides of the Amur and Tian-Shan. Today  Russia and China call themselves partners. And this is not  without foundation. Not only have political and economic  relations become fully reestablished in recent years--these  relations continue to develop intensively today. Nonetheless,  quite a number of problems remain. Both sides are therefore  placing great hopes in the visit to Beijing of Russian Prime  Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, which began yesterday.    Paradoxical though it may seem at first glance, the greatest  problems have accumulated precisely in that sphere where a  qualitative leap has recently been achieved--in trade, the  volume of which increased 30 percent last year, amounting to  $7.68 billion. Among Russia's trading partners, China has pushed  Italy aside and now occupies second place, after the FRG. A  number of experts have hastened to predict that by 1995, the  bilateral trade turnover will pass the record level of $10  billion. However, indices for the first two months of this year  have poured water on the hopes of the optimists--trade was  reduced by almost 50 percent as compared with the level for the  same period of 1993.    The reason? As the poet expressed it, "there is one answer  and it is terribly simple." Bilateral trade has to date been  extensive in nature and based on two key elements--"shuttles"  and barter (up to 65 percent of the trade volume). The first of  these was eliminated by the visa mode of operation introduced at  the beginning of the year, curtailing what used to be a  virtually unrestricted flow of goods out of the PRC (as this  KOMMERSANT-DAILY columnist was told in Blagoveshchensk,  steamships used to come from the Chinese bank of the Amur loaded  just about to the top of their smokestacks). While the blow to  barter, the Chinese believe, was inflicted by Russia's  introduction of high import duties. But this is just one side of  the coin. The other side is the low quality of Chinese goods  offered for exchange. Thus, in 1992 the Chinese managed to  purchase 26 Su-27 fighters from Russia, paying for them with  sneakers and feather beds, most of which, a Ministry for Foreign  Economic Relations employee told the KOMMERSANT-DAILY columnist,  are today gathering dust in warehouses, unsold because of their  poor quality.    [begin box]  <H5>  Status of Russian Indebtedness to China </H5>   Russia's Credit Indebtedness to China    --$570 million--settlement-clearing indebtedness for goods  delivery shortages to China, 1986-1990;    --$350 million--credits extended by China in 1990 for the  purchase of food, raw materials for food production, and  consumer goods;    --$670--credits extended by China in 1991 for the  above-mentioned purposes;    In 1994 Russia must deliver goods to the PRC amounting to  about $290 million, to pay off 1990 credits and the interest on  these credits. Settlement-clearing indebtedness for 1986-1990  will be paid off almost entirely in 1994 through deliveries of  military equipment and other special property.    [end box]    During his visit to China, Chernomyrdin must find a way out  of this situation which is capable of bringing economic ties  between the two countries to an impasse. The two sides will  evidently try to reach compromise on the visa mode of  operation--visas for inhabitants of the border regions will  either be canceled or replaced by multiple-use visas (true, it  is up to the Chinese to do something here--they have not yet  been able to determine their "multiple-exit" citizens). While  barter may be replaced by mutual accounting operations using  currency. Chernomyrdin might also convince the Chinese of the  advantages of expanding military-technical cooperation. Russia  is counting on the shipment of another consignment of Su-27's,  Il-76 transport aircraft, and military helicopters. Moscow also  hopes to sell submarines to Beijing. But rumors regarding the  sale of an aircraft carrier have turned out to be exaggerated.  They were refuted on the eve of the visit by Mikhail Belyy,  director of the First Asia Department of the Russian Ministry of  Foreign Affairs, in an interview with ITAR-TASS.    [begin box]  <H5>  Most Important Items in Export-Import Transactions Between </H5> Russia and China    Russia exports to China (percentage of total  exports):    --machinery and equipment (30 percent)    --ferrous and nonferrous metals (13 percent)    --mineral fertilizers and raw chemicals (45 percent)    Russia imports from China (percentage of total  imports):    --machinery and equipment (10 percent)    --chemical products (4 percent)    --raw minerals (7 percent)    --industrial and consumer goods (45 percent)    Volume of trade in 1993--$7.68 million. Of this  amount, exports constitute $4.99 million,  imports--$2.69 million. Russia's positive trade  balance is $2.3 million.    [end box]    But Moscow should not be counting on much in the export of  arms. After all, even during the years when "Russians and  Chinese were brothers forever," the USSR transferred to the PRC  about 25,000 packages of documentation enabling the PRC to set  up their output of tanks, small arms, and other armament. But it  is precisely these types of armament that essentially constitute  Russian export items. And with regard to military equipment not  produced in China, Beijing is asking that it be sold production  licenses (for those same Su-27's, for example).    One other circumstance should not be permitted to disappear  from view--the fact that Moscow is not (and most likely never  will be) the leading partner of the PRC. Trade turnover between  the PRC and United States, for example, has already reached $40  billion, and Washington's threats to deny Beijing  most-favored-nation trade status because of its human rights  violations in Tiananmen will apparently remain only words. Bill  Clinton does not intend to confirm this status today or  tomorrow. And Beijing has a real chance to become a member of  GATT by mid-1995. Production in the most developed Chinese  regions--the southern regions--is oriented toward the West. In  this regard, the conclusion drawn by the British publication  FINANCIAL TIMES--that the PRC views Russia not as a prospective  equal-rights trading partner, but exclusively as a source of  inexpensive raw materials and customer for second-rate Chinese  consumer goods--does not appear all that groundless.</p>

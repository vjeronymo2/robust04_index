			<p><P> February 6, 1990, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> FEINSTEIN OPENS CAMPAIGN WITH AN AMBITIOUS AGENDA  </P> <P> Former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein formally kicked off her campaign  for governor Monday by advocating a costly package of educational, health,  housing and public assistance programs she said would be financed by user fees  and by adjusting spending priorities.  </P> <P> "I am not proposing an increase in the state income tax. . . . I have no plans  to raise the sales tax for any of these programs," she told reporters at a  series of news conferences announcing her candidacy for the Democratic  nomination for governor in the June 5 primary.  </P> <P> She said she would also ask the Legislature for "a complete re-evaluation of  the mandates" that currently control most state spending. But when asked about  welfare cost-of-living increases, one of the biggest and most frequently  challenged mandates, Feinstein said only that they "are a difficult issue."  </P> <P> She also said that as governor she would seek a constitutional amendment to  allow local schools to pass bonds by a simple majority, rather than the current  two-thirds vote, to help finance what is potentially the most expensive of her  priorities: the reduction of classroom sizes in California schools.  </P> <P> Her platform also includes new programs to curb domestic violence, train  welfare mothers and reduce infant mortality, and the creation of a new state  growth management commission, a new department of ocean resources, a state  office of children and family and a new post of drug czar.  </P> <P> On environmental issues, Feinstein said, "I will just say no to offshore oil  drilling."  </P> <P> She also repeated her proposal to create a new "California jump start program  to provide early childhood education for every 4-year-old who wants it," which  she said would cost $750 million to $800 million annually.  </P> <P> Altogether, Feinstein outlined new programs totaling several billion dollars  annually in new spending, but she declined to list specific revenue sources  except to "take a good look at the lottery and how that money is distributed"  to the schools.  </P> <P> "You all want me to say, 'Yes, I'm going to raise taxes.' What I'm saying is, I  am going to try to prioritize a government to be able to get the most bang for  the buck within my priorities. That means some things that exist may have to  go," she said, declining further questions on how she would pay for her  proposals.  </P> <P> She added that she supports Gov. George Deukmejian's proposal on the June 5  ballot to double the state's gasoline tax from 9 cents to 18 cents a gallon  "because it's a user fee and those are the best" way to finance government  because voters can see the link between their money and the programs they  support.  </P> <P> As the first woman to be a major candidate for governor of California,  Feinstein put special emphasis on the support of women voters.  </P> <P> "This is a big moment for me, and a historic one for women," she said. "Much  thought and deliberation preceded this decision. I am a non-incumbent in a race  against two entrenched statewide figures -- a woman in a field of men."  </P> <P> She also made a strong pitch for support from women voters on the abortion  issue. Although her two rivals for governor, Republican U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson  and Democratic Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp are both pro-choice, she said  that as a woman she is best qualified to protect the right to choice.  </P> <P> "It's true men can protect women's rights. But it's also true the experiences  of men and women are different experiences. I very strongly believe . . . with  a woman who is governor, I know if she believes in choice, she's not going to  have anything to do with any erosion of that basic optional right," Feinstein  said.  </P> <P> Discussing Van de Kamp's qualifications, Feinstein said "there are judgmental  questions that enter into it -- judgmental questions involving (his failure to  prosecute) the Hillside Strangler, judgmental questions involving the savings  and loans, judgmental questions involving the crime victims initiative" that  Van de Kamp contends could undermine abortion rights.  </P></p>

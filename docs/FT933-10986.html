			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Heavy profit-taking by blue-chips lowers Dow Wall Street HEAVY profit-taking in blue-chip stocks meant US equity markets ended most lower across the board yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 27.95 at 3,539.47. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended down 2.11 at 448.13, while the Amex composite finished 0.41 firmer at 437.00, and the Nasdaq composite down 2.52 at 704.70. Trading volume on the NYSE was 250m shares. The markets ended a difficult week on a downbeat note. On Thursday stocks had posted gains in spite of disappointing news on second quarter economic growth, primarily because the weak gross GDP led to a sharp drop in bond yields, which is always good news for equity investors. Yesterday, however, the markets were unable to sustain their upward momentum as profit-taking swept the blue-chip sector. Prices opened weaker, but it was not until bond prices turned notably lower at mid-morning that the selling in the stock markets gathered pace. The reversal in bond prices, which pushed the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond back up to 6.6 per cent, was only temporary, and by late afternoon the 30-year yield was back nearer 6.5 per cent. Among individual stocks, Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing tumbled Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 105 after the big industrial group announced a modest increase in second quarter earnings to Dollars 331m. The stock declined in spite of a warning from the company earlier this year about their profits outlook. The big insurance group Aetna also fell on earnings news, the stock slipping Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 58 3/8 . Walt Disney remained troubled by its recently disappointing profits report, falling another Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 37 1/2 in volume of 2.5m shares. Profit-taking took its toll on a variety of leading Dow stocks, including Allied Signal, down Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 70 1/8 , Eastman Kodak, down Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 53 3/4 , Coca-Cola, down Dollars 3/4 at Dollars 43 1/4 , and Caterpillar, lower Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 76 7/8 . Improved earnings continued to help car stocks, with General Motors climbing Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 48 1/2 . AL Laboratories slumped Dollars 9 to Dollars 14 5/8 in busy trading after the company warned that it would struggle to equal to match last year's operating earnings result. On the Nasdaq market, the big story was Microsoft, which tumbled Dollars 5 to Dollars 74 in volume of 9m shares as investors reacted negatively to Thursday's late warning from the company about future revenue growth and software prices, which will be kept low by competitive pressures. Several leading Wall Street brokerage houses cut their earnings forecasts after the warning. Canada TORONTO closed higher in active trading, helped by a 1.48 per cent rise in the gold index as bullion prices soared. The TSE composite index gained 9.68 to close at 3,967.23.</p>

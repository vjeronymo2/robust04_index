			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Letter to the editor by Xiang Gan (3276 1626): "What Do </F> the Village Cadres Want?"]    [Text] Comrade Editor:    We village cadres come into contact with the tail-end of the  party's and the state's policies, principles, and lines, and we  are the ones who faithfully carry out the party's rural  policies. It is our obligation to serve the people. But these  days, many of the rural tasks really bewilder and puzzle us.    First, there is family planning. Family planning is the  nation's fundamental policy; but to us, it is the most difficult  task on earth.    Second, we have to collect grain payment and taxes. In the  past, it was the crown grain and state taxes which no one could  refuse. Last year, grain prices were decontrolled and the  villages' unified apportionment and procurement responsibilities  with regard to grains were rescinded. But this year, our  superiors have forced us to get money and grain from the  peasants based on their past apportionment and procurement  responsibilities; otherwise they would refuse to pay wages. In  the past, agricultural tax could be offset by grain payment, but  today, grain prices are higher than the agricultural  tax--generally the difference is 5 yuan per dan. If the peasants  pay all of their agricultural tax but do not deliver some grain  for the remaining apportionment and procurement  responsibilities, they must pay 5 yuan per dan to cover the  price difference. Most of their money is handed over to the  grain stations, and the peasants do not even get a piece of  paper as receipt. We feel that we are the "bandits" and are in  turn "robbed." Even though we do not want to be "bandits," the  peasants have no choice but to look at us coldly with frowning  brows.    Third, we have to make the peasants buy insurance. Our wages  were docked last December and we still have not been paid. This  is because we have not completed the insurance tasks that were  assigned to us. According to our assignment, each peasant must  pay the insurance companies 10 yuan for insurance. In the remote  and poor countryside, this is indeed a task we cannot accomplish.    Fourth, our superiors come to check on us: When the leaders  come, they eat, drink, and have a good time. Afterwards, they  sometimes even want us to pay them wages.    Fifth, the public security bureaus and local police stations  send people to the homes of criminal elements to collect fines.  Thousands and thousands have been collected, but there is not a  single receipt.    Faced with poverty and corruption, what should we do? What  are the responsibilities of the county, district, and village  cadres? How do we do our jobs? We would appreciate the public's  comments.</p>

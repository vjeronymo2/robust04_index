			<p>931106 FT  06 NOV 93 / Deng wants patriots for HK Mr Deng Xiaoping, China's paramount leader, has warned that only 'patriots' would be permitted to administer Hong Kong once its reverts to Chinese rule in 1997, Tony Walker reports from Beijing. Mr Deng's remarks, published yesterday in the Chinese press, are certain to deepen concerns among pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong about possible reprisals against public figures who have expressed misgivings about Beijing's intentions. He defined 'patriots' as those who supported the 'motherland' and did nothing to hurt Hong Kong's prosperity and stability.</p>

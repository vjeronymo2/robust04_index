			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Lookers halved to Pounds 615,000 PRE-TAX profits of Lookers, the Manchester-based motor dealer and agricultural machinery group, were halved, from Pounds 1.23m to Pounds 615,000, in the half year to end-March. Turnover declined by Pounds 19.7m to Pounds 154.4m. Mr Ken Martindale, chairman, said the results of the businesses operated by the group had variously affected the economic difficulties referred to in his last review. Profits on car sales were reduced against the background of a national market which was down by more than 13 per cent on the previous year and 35 per cent on three years ago, he said. However, profitability of service and parts remained steady. Results from the caravan business deteriorated slightly, although contract hire profits showed a considerable increase. Car delivery and van bodybuilding also improved. The interest charge fell to Pounds 3.14m (Pounds 4.3m). Gearing has been cut from 115 per cent to 107 per cent. Losses per share were 0.9p (2p earnings), while the interim dividend is unchanged at 2p.</p>

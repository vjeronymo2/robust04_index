			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Cambodia trade sanctions Trade sanctions against the Khmer Rouge have come into effect after the guerrilla faction launched its most serious attack on UN peacekeepers since they were deployed in Cambodia, Reuter reports from Phnom Penh. The sanctions were imposed by the UN Security Council in November because of the hardline guerrilla group's refusal to comply with the peace accord signed in Paris in October 1991 to end 13 years of civil war.</p>

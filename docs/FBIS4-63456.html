			<p>BFN     [Text] Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko said he  and his Russian counterpart Andrey Kozyrev realized that the  actions of the leadership of the Ukrainian autonomous republic  of Crimea did not meet the interests of either Russia or Ukraine.    "We have agreed to hold joint consultations in case of any  unforeseen developments," Zlenko told reporters on Saturday [21  May] commenting on a telephone conversation he had had with  Kozyrev the same day.    Zlenko said the conversation had made it clear that "Russia  will refrain from any interference in the current situation in  Crimea." He expressed the hope that Ukraine and Russia "will  manage to set in motion a negotiation mechanism that would help  find a solution to the problem." Ukraine will not use force in  Crimea "unless the other side provokes it," he said.    Some sources told INTERFAX-Ukraine that, following the last  telephone conversation between the Ukrainian and Russian  presidents, a Ukrainian government delegation, led by acting  Prime Minister Yefim Zvyagilskiy, was leaving for Moscow on  Monday to discuss the division of the disputed Black Sea Fleet,  a friendship and cooperation treaty between the two countries  and the Crimean problem.    On Friday, Zlenko said in a letter to Kozyrev that the  Crimean legislature's decision to restore the Crimean  Constitution approved on 6 May 1992, jeopardized political  stability in Ukraine and might cause tension between Ukraine and  Russia. He said that, in case of further trouble in Crimea,  Ukraine might take all measures allowed by its constitution and  legislation to preserve its territorial integrity.    Kozyrev, in a reply to Zlenko, said the possibility of  Russian-Ukrainian tension over Crimea was bound to cause  concern. But it is important "to respect the sovereign will of  peoples, show restraint and rule out the use of force. All  problems arising between Ukraine and the sovereign Republic of  Crimea -- forming part of Ukraine -- must be settled solely by  political means," the Russian minister said.    "The situation in Crimea once again proves the need to solve  the problems of the Black Sea Fleet as soon as possible, on the  basis of the agreements between the presidents of the two  countries. Russia is ready for this," Kozyrev said</p>

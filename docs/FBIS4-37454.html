			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Finance Minister Ahmad Husayn has said that the  noble gesture of leader President Saddam Husayn, may God  preserve him, to improve the state employees' standard of living  is part of a series of noble gestures with which the leader of  the people and inciter of their potential has accustomed us.  [passage omitted]    He explained: To let figures speak for themselves, this  noble gesture, at its minimum, will grant the bachelor state  employee 450 dinars per month if he works in Baghdad or the  provincial capitals, and 550 dinars if he works outside Baghdad  and the provincial capitals. At its maximum, this gesture will  provide a married state employee with five children an income  increase of 750 dinars if he works in Baghdad or the provincial  capitals, and 850 dinars if he works outside Baghdad and the  provincial capitals. Between these two limits, the income  increases for those covered by the noble gesture depends on the  number of dependent children.    The minister noted: If we take into consideration the nature  of the Iraqi family, which is often an extended family, this may  result in having more than one family member covered by the  gesture. Supposing that a family consists of a husband, a wife,  and three children all of whom are state employees covered by  the leader president's gesture, this family will have a monthly  income increase of 2,300 dinars if they work in Baghdad or the  provincial capitals, and 2,800 dinars if they work outside  Baghdad and the provincial capitals. [passage omitted]    The finance minister explained that the leader president's  generous gesture will add to the state treasury a monthly  financial obligation of 1.25 billion dinars, or an annual  obligation of 15 billion dinars. Therefore, he noted, this  gesture expresses the leader president's determination to  achieve prosperity and happiness for the people under the  existing hard economic circumstances. Naturally, he added, in  view of their absolute confidence in the leader president's  command of the march of jihad and reconstruction under the  blockade and in his generous gestures which aim at improving the  general living standards of the entire population, those covered  by the gesture should rise to national responsibility and  improve their performance in all fields of work. They should  double their efforts to increase production and provide the best  services for citizens to ease the burdens of the unfair blockade.</p>

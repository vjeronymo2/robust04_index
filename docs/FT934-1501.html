			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Go-getters wait for starting gun: Norma Cohen on the outlook for a possible successor to the USM The UK's Unlisted Securities Market is dying. Is there going to be a son of USM? If European venture capitalists have their say, the London Stock Exchange would accelerate plans for a new offspring. At a recent seminar, together with the chairmen of many small companies, they were asked whether they would prefer to list shares on the London Stock Exchange or a new exchange tailored to their requirements. The answer was overwhelming. The entrepreneurial companies' exchange won hands down. The seminar indicated the widespread dissatisfaction among small companies at the way they are crowded out by large companies who dominate the London Stock Exchange's official list. Last April, the City Group for Smaller Companies (Cisco), a group of UK venture capitalists, small company chairman and stockbrokers, published a paper calling for a new Enterprise Market for the trading of smaller companies' shares. The model, Cisco says, would be the US-based Nasdaq, which was set up in the 1970s as an exchange for small companies but is now the second-largest stock market in the world by trading volume, and includes many large companies. It expanded rapidly in the 1980s as fast-growing companies such as Apple, Microsoft and Intel chose it for the initial public offerings of their shares. Mr Richard Balarkas, chief executive of Cisco, says the group would prefer to see a new UK enterprise exchange, which it estimates would cost Pounds 20m to develop independently, operating under the aegis of the existing London Stock Exchange. But it has investigated whether there might be alternative commercial providers, including Nasdaq, because it fears that it will be some time, if at all, before the stock exchange acts. This week such worries have come to a head. The stock exchange's board shelved a report from its own smaller companies' working party which recommended a new Nasdaq-type Enterprise Exchange - similar to that proposed by Cisco - to replace the USM which is due to close by 1996.' The existing official list clearly meets the financing needs of many smaller companies,' the board says. Some 90 companies have floated their shares on the stock exchange official list so far this year, it adds. According to the exchange, the USM's closure later this decade was announced earlier this year partly because it was becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish between companies trading there and those on the official list. Moreover recent amendments to the qualifications required for a listing on the main exchange will make it easier still for small, high-technology companies - including those which have not yet sold any products - to raise equity capital on the official list. However, the exchange acknowledges 'a widespread perception that the needs of smaller companies are not always adequately catered for' and promises further market research. Mr Giles Vardy, market development director at the exchange and a member of the working party, says that the idea of a new market for small companies has not been totally rejected. Privately, however, some members of Cisco believe the stock exchange is not prepared to cede ground to a potential rival. Already the exchange has seen some of its core functions - such as its monopoly over the distribution of share price information and its role in settling share transactions - taken over by others. Its control over the listing of shares remains one of the few areas where its dominance has not been questioned; an enterprise exchange, with its own board of directors and chief executive, would do just that, even if under the wing of the main exchange. Mr Vardy, however, denies that the exchange is trying to block a potential competitor. 'We have no divine right to run the only stock exchange in this country,' he says. The exchange's reticence may be justified. While many venture capitalists are convinced that an enterprise exchange will draw investors, their confidence is not universal. During the past few years of recession, small companies have watched helplessly as trading in shares listed on the USM fizzled out and investors withdrew their capital. 'In a bull market, there is nothing that avarice will not overcome,' says Mr Brian Winterflood, chairman of Winterflood Securities which specialises in small company shares. 'What we want is a market which will stand up in a recession.' Mr Neil Austen, partner in the corporate finance practice at KPMG Peat Marwick, says: 'The USM achieved some of the aims of smaller companies. But it was overtaken by changes in fashion and culture. It was seen by entrepreneurs as an end in itself and many of the companies traded there didn't have a clear strategy. They couldn't cope with the downturn.' Now, as the economy emerges from recession, it remains unclear whether there would be sufficient interest from either institutional or private investors. Mr Geoffrey Madrell, chief executive of Pro-Share, an organisation which promotes individual share ownership in the UK, argues that the US experience shows that it is small investors who are likely to drive the new market. Large institutions, he says, regard substantial investment in many small companies as too risky and not worth the research effort. But Mr Austen, believes the behaviour of small private investors in the past few years show they are unlikely, either, to show much interest in an enterprise exchange. 'If privatisations and the discounts they carry have not attracted private individuals, then nothing will,' he says. A possible means of stimulating private investor involvement would be for institutions to package shares in enterprise market companies into easily-tradable unit and investment trusts. If Nasdaq is a guide, such a stimulus may prove essential in the early stages of a new market. Initially, private investors accounted for more than half the trading volume on Nasdaq although subsequently the figure has fallen. But Nasdaq officials do not believe their experience can necessarily be repeated in the UK. Firstly, the US system of regulation has promoted competition between many different exchanges. In the UK, the London Stock Exchange still faces little competition. Nasdaq's success reflects its ability to attract well-managed companies with good products. 'When a small company lists on Nasdaq, retail investors are interested because they all want to buy the next Intel or Apple,' says one exchange official. The US system has spawned a multitude of stockbrokers who track the shares of some of the smallest companies, helping private investors to find bargains among the multitude of choices. The creation of a US-style exchange for entrepreneurial companies looks a long way off in Britain. The stock exchange must decide whether it wants to be the creator of this new market, or whether it will allow a competitor to take the initiative. But the debate about structure may prove secondary to the central question of whether British investors are prepared to commit their cash.</p>

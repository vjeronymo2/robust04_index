			<p>BFN     [Text] Caracas, 8 May (AFP) -- Caracas police units have  been placed on alert and will be deployed in the streets on  Monday to prevent potential disturbances in light of the  complete work stoppage by 35,000 transportation drivers in the  Venezuelan capital, it was reported this Sunday.    The transportation workers' show of force will effect 4  million Caracas residents, and it is possible that drivers in  the countryside affiliated with the sole union of small  transportation vans and buses (interprovincial vans and buses)  will join the strike.    The drivers demand a readjustment in fare prices and the  immediate payment of government commitments owed them since  December under a subsidy agreement for student bus tickets.    Meanwhile, Sucre Municipality -- the second largest  municipality in the capital -- prohibited public demonstrations  and suspended all classes in its jurisdiction.    Political analysts recommended canceling classes throughout  the capital to avoid disturbances such as those that occurred on  Thursday, when a police officer killed student German Sotillo  with three gunshots.    Deputy Transportation Minister Francisco Urdaneta met with  transportation workers the previous evening and promised to pay  the subsidy debt in full as of next week. The drivers, however,  did not accept the offer and stated that the final hour had  arrived.    Newspaper sources reported that given the looming difficult  situation, an emergency unit was organized in Sucre Municipality  by the Caracas Metropolitan Police, the Judicial Technical  Police (PTJ-detectives), the Directorate of Intelligence and  Preventive Services (Disip), and Civil Defense.    Their spokesmen assured that the officers of these police  units are on a state of alert and are studying strategies to  prevent street disturbances.</p>

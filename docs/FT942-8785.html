			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Call to separate rights and China MFN decision Support is growing in Congress for a strategy to separate the annual renewal of China's Most Favoured Nation trade status from demands that it improve its human rights policies. A letter has been sent to President Bill Clinton from 106 members of both parties which called for creation of a US-Chinese human rights commission as a 'constructive and effective alternative' to the yearly confrontation over MFN renewal. The commission could include government and private sector experts on human rights, jurists, and business and religious leaders. Meanwhile, State Department officials yesterday seemed to confirm reports that Mr Clinton had sent a secret envoy to Beijing to urge progress on human rights so that the president could renew China's MFN status. Mr Mike McCurry, the State Department spokesman, did not deny the reports and affirmed that there were 'many aspects of quiet diplomacy that we have been pursuing.' On June 3, the president must determine whether China has met the human rights and immigration conditions linked to the renewal. Business lobbyists have also urged the separation of MFN and human rights, warning that loss of MFN would be almost as blighting to the US economy as China's. On Sunday Senator George Mitchell, Senate majority leader, said he was drafting trade sanctions, to be introduced in the Senate, in the event that China fails to meet the conditions. The Administration has been arguing that progress has been achieved in human rights. However, continued detention of dissidents and only marginal advances in China's treatment of Tibetans has undermined those claims.</p>

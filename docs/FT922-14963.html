			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Survey of Milton Keynes (6): Taking pride in successes - Foreign Investment MILTON KEYNES takes pride in a conspicuously high level of foreign investment as proof of its success over the past 25 years in attracting diverse businesses from far and wide. Almost 10 per cent of the companies which have set up in Milton Keynes are internationally based, giving the city well over 200 foreign corporate citizens. Altogether, Milton Keynes boasts 19 countries from continental Europe and further afield in its international community. While the US dominates the scene, with 90 American companies represented, the Japanese also have a considerable presence, with 44 companies at the last count. According to the Milton Keynes Development Corporation, which was wound up at the end of March, although incoming investment has slowed, it has not dried up, even in the recession. For multinational companies looking to the single European market and ahead, Milton Keynes apparently offers many advantages despite its location in one of the more remote regions of the enlarged European stage. The English language already gives Britain an advantage over other EC countries in the eyes of both American and Japanese companies looking to locate their European operations. What makes Milton Keynes more attractive than other British cities is its central location within the UK. Its proximity to key international airports, such as Luton and Heathrow, is a natural advantage. Alps Electric, the world's largest independent manufacturer of electromechanical components, looked at sites throughout Europe before settling on Milton Keynes as the ideal location from which to service its customers throughout the European market. The company, which supplies big name consumer electronics manufacturers, such as Sony and Panasonic, with electromechanical components and other products, found Milton Keynes provided it with the central location it needed to meet its customers' requirements. 'We need to be within two hours of our customers to give them maximum support,' says Mr Peter Woodland, business planning manager of Alps (UK). From Milton Keynes, Alps can also reach most parts of continental Europe within two to three hours and there are also excellent road links to the ports. Since 1984, the Japanese manufacturer has invested Pounds 19m in its plant where it makes television and video cassette recorder tuners and remote control handsets for televisions and VCRs, among other products. Unisys, the American network information systems and services group, is another company that found Milton Keynes attractive for the access it provides to other parts of the UK and continental Europe. The group acquired 420,000 sq ft of property adjacent to one of the city's attractive man-made lakes and has invested Pounds 40m so far to set up a UK customer services centre and a European education and training centre, complete with a 250-room hotel. The site also houses its European node of the group's worldwide data communications network. One of the key functions of the customer services centre is to ensure rapid supply of any parts that are needed at a customer's site within the UK. 'In a service-oriented business, the complete solution (to information systems) and fast response time differentiates us from other companies,' says Mr Phil Baker, personnel manager. Being in Milton Keynes, where Unisys also has an enormous warehouse containing thousands of hardware products and parts for its various systems, and where it is also is within easy reach of one of Unisys's big parts distribution centres in the Netherlands, means that it is able to respond quickly to customer problems that come into the customer services centre. In addition to being centrally located between London and Birmingham, its proximity to London is another obvious advantage enjoyed by Milton Keynes. For Alps, this was a key point that helped it to recruit talented engineers and technical staff. 'It is not so easy to attract good engineers to remoter areas,' Mr Woodland says. The other side of the coin, however, is that proximity to London means pay rates are influenced by London's high levels. Location, although important, is only one of several factors that have attracted international companies to Milton Keynes. The availability of land and housing at reasonable prices turned both Alps and Unisys in favour of Milton Keynes. Unisys, in particular, needed to find a site where it could consolidate seven different training and service locations. 'Having an environment in which we could grow was a key consideration,' says Mr Martin Sexton, director of company communications. Milton Keynes has been much maligned by the British public - to which the city, laid out on a grid, appears as an urban sprawl, lacking in character. But the quality of life offered by the city was actually instrumental in attracting many foreign companies. Housing was available at reasonable prices, although prices have risen in recent years. The safe and comfortable environment was an important factor in easing concerns about living in a foreign country among Alps's Japanese managers. 'The golf courses were just a coincidence,' Mr Woodland says. Contrary to the cold and uninviting image Milton Keynes has among many Britons, the city is seen by many Japanese and Americans - who are perhaps more accustomed to the modern urban landscape - and, indeed, the Britons who live there, as outward-looking and dynamic. 'It had a very modern image, which is the image Alps wanted to portray,' according to Mr Woodland. And in spite of some initial resistance among Unisys's 60 or so instructors who had to be relocated to Milton Keynes from various parts of the country, Mr Sexton is confident that 'to a man, everybody who lives in Milton Keynes enjoys being here.' Unisys is also happy to find more reliable administrative and support staff in Milton Keynes than it had in London. The stability among staff at Milton Keynes is a contrast to the very high turnover rate it experienced in London and the community spirit is better, it says. This may also have to do with the community spirit being fostered in Milton Keynes by the companies that locate there. Mr Kyoshi Watano, managing director of Alps (UK) is a director of the local Training and Enterprise Council, a previous director of the Milton Keynes Chamber of Commerce and chairman of the local Japan club. Alps and Unisys are both patrons of the Milton Keynes Community Trust. Foreign investment in Milton Keynes is likely to remain subdued until there are stronger signs of economic recovery in leading industrialised countries. But the closing of the Development Corporation is also a growing concern for businesses already in Milton Keynes. 'There is a strong body of opinion among businesses that wants Milton Keynes to develop as it has. Now that the Development Corporation is handing over to the council, there is obviously a concern that the priorities might change,' says Mr Sexton.</p>

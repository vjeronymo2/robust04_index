			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vazha Khachapuridze, state plenipotentiary </F> on questions concerning the settlement of the Georgian-Ossetian  conflict and personal envoy of the Georgian head of state in the  Shida Kartli region, by Spartak Kobulia in Tbilisi; date not  given: "Vazha Khachapuridze: `Samachablo Was and Will Be Part  of Georgia Where Ossetians and Georgians Will Live Together!"]    [Text] As is known, in accordance with a directive of the  Georgian head of state, Batoni [Georgian polite form of address]  Vazha Khachapuridze has been appointed as state plenipotentiary  on questions concerning the settlement of the Georgian-Ossetian  conflict and personal envoy of the Georgian head of state in the  Shida Kartli region. We propose an interview with him.    [Kobulia] Batono Vazha, if I may be so bold and begin by  asking you a direct question: Why were you precisely chosen  when the decision was adopted to extend to such a degree the  functions and powers of the head of state's personal envoy in  the Shida Kartli region?    [Khachapuridze] Not only the functions and powers but also  responsibilities (and this is the most important thing) have  been considerably increased. Proceeding from the situation that  has taken shape, this is fully justified. There is a real  danger that the Georgian-Ossetian conflict could soon turn into  a chronic Georgian disease. It is no secret that the war in  Abkhazia and our internal political upheavals have ostensibly  transformed events in former South Ossetia into a problem of  secondary importance. The fact that there has apparently been  no fighting here for some time has contributed to this.  However, in reality, the situation has been getting more  complex from day to day and...unfortunately, this is continuing.  In addition, the psyche and mood of the region's Ossetian  population is changing. In reality, many of them today no  longer consider themselves to be Georgian citizens! If we delay  things again, this process could acquire an irreversible  character. Given that, let us say, former relations between the  Ossetian population and the north [North Ossetia] are becoming  stronger and more extensive by the day, immediate measures need  to be adopted if we are not to lose forever this historic part  of Georgia.    This is not to mention such a common plague as drug  addiction.... I will say without exaggeration that the struggle  against Ossetian separatism could become child's play compared  with the struggle against drug addiction. We let slip the  opportunity to nip the drugs business in the bud (the Georgian  Government at the time was faced with other vitally important  problems); it has today turned into a monster that will be  difficult to defeat. In short, the complexity and variety of  the problems that need to be solved have necessitated extensive  powers and considerable responsibility. As regards my  appointment, probably one factor in this was that I come from  Samachablo; I grew up there and began work there. I continue to  have close contacts and relations with Georgian and Ossetian  circles and am able to enter into dialogue with them, which is  so essential today. One should also take into account that I  have normal relations with the command of the Russian  peacekeeping forces in the region....    [Kobulia] At the end of last year, our press wrote that you  travelled to North Ossetia and established contacts with local  sociopolitical circles. Are these contacts continuing?    [Khachapuridze] Of course. While we were in Vladikavkaz, we  had fruitful meetings with North Ossetian scholarly circles,  parliamentarians, and representatives of the Georgian  compatriots' association. We now plan to have another meeting  but, this time, with the participation of CSCE representatives.  We pin great hopes on this process. There are, after all,  hundreds of thousands of refugees from Georgia in North Ossetia  and the local leadership is extremely interested in a peaceful  settlement of the conflict. The main thing is that everyone is  clearly fed up with the "hot" or "cold" war....    [Kobulia] If it is not a secret, what position does  Vladikavkaz hold regarding the question of the status of  Samachablo?    [Khachapuridze] I will begin by telling you that no one  questions the territorial integrity of Georgia. As regards its  general status, it is natural that the resolution of this  political problem of state importance does not and cannot fall  within the jurisdiction of the region's state plenipotentiary.  The Constitution will decide this, taking into account the  interests of all national minorities and all peoples living in  Georgia in accordance with the recognized norms of international  law. It does not accord with Georgia's interests if we fill our  future statehood with new time bombs as the Bolsheviks did in  the 1920's. Therefore, I believe that, taking into account  every moment, Ossetian and Georgian specialists should discuss  the status issue together; after all, one should not disregard  the fact that more Ossetians live outside the former South  Ossetian Oblast -- in the same Georgia -- than within it. What  rights should Ossetians living in Tbilisi, Gori, Khashuri,  Kareli, Akhmeta, or Lagodekhi have? In no way do we want them  to have fewer rights than their compatriots in Tskhinvali or  Java. I am not a lawyer but I do know that all Ossetians should  enjoy equal rights in the future Georgia. Any other Georgia  will not be a democratic state.    [Kobulia] Your words have an optimistic ring about them. As  can be seen, you view the future with hope. Upon what is this  optimism based? After all, today's opposition blame the  authorities for the loss of both Abkhazia and Samachablo.    [Khachapuridze] What opposition does not blame the  authorities for one thing or another? To what extent these  accusations are justified is another question. It is a fact  that our jurisdiction has become fiction in a number of regions  of Georgia. However, I personally have no doubt that this is a  temporary phenomenon. Take a look at our history. How often  and for how long have we lost this or that territory? Didn't  the amir [Muslim governor] have his residence in Tbilisi itself?  God forbid that even the opposition should sincerely believe  that Sukhumi or Tskhinvali have been lost forever. The Georgian  nation will not forgive anyone -- neither the current  authorities nor that opposition that could itself come to power  tomorrow -- for the loss of Georgia's ancient land. This issue  is a double-edged sword and any attempt to use it for narrow  political motives is extremely risky. Finally, it is not a  particular government but the country, the entire nation, and  posterity that loses any territory. As regards specifically  Samachablo, it is in no way "lost." If I did not believe this,  I would not have assumed this post. I accepted it because I  believed that Samachablo was and will be a part of Georgia where  Ossetians and Georgians will live together.    [Kobulia] We Georgians have difficulty in finding the  "golden mean" everywhere and in everything. We have to go to  either one extreme or the other. Now also, one part of society  pins its hopes only on diplomacy and international organizations  while the other believes that the only way of getting back  Abkhazia and Samachablo is by force. As you have told us, you  are opposed to violent methods.    [Khachapuridze] As a person with a certain knowledge of  politics (I do not wish to call myself a politician), I do not  exclude violent methods in principle; in a certain situation,  the interests of the state demand the use of force. After all,  hasn't the United States often used force to establish order in  the country? You remember how they dealt with the "Black  Panthers." As regards our case, I believe that there are no  prospects for resolving the Georgian-Ossetian conflict by force.  Let us suppose that, with the help of external forces,  ultranationalist and separatist forces on the Ossetian side  would be able to maintain temporarily independence from Georgia.  Then what? First, this would not constitute any kind of  independence; even Vladikavkaz itself does not recognize them.  Second, this would bring more misfortune to the Ossetian  people! Likewise to us. If we use force to get Ossetians to  accept conditions that do not correspond to their legal  interests, this will also not be a guarantee of firm and lasting  peace. The very first minor pretext will become a catalyst for  renewed bloodshed, destruction, and a fresh flow of persecuted  people; there can be no victor in a civil war and, likewise, one  cannot neutralize once and for all relapses into civil war by  force. Only a political approach and mutual agreement are  acceptable here, when neither side feels that it is being  deceived. Therefore, while there remains the slightest chance  of settling the conflict by political means, I exclude any use  of force. We should use our power and Ossetian power against  the common enemy -- the drugs business and the drugs mafia.  That is why we are calling upon the help of scholars and  experts and I view this as a great force. Kalbatoni Marika  Lortkipanidze and Batonebi Nodar Lomouri, Zurab Porakishvili,  Levan Toidze, Soso Tsintsadze, and Levan Mataradze are already  actively cooperating with us.    [Kobulia] A final question: Today, we are talking in  Tbilisi although any person will tell you that your place is in  Tskhinvali. How long will it be, do you think, before we can  meet and continue our chat in Tskhinvali?    [Khachapuridze] Desire always exceeds reality. There is a  difference between optimism and illusion. A great deal of work  is necessary before a Tbilisian can freely go to Tskhinvali and  feel safe. We are ready to do this work and we have elaborated  a plan for this. This is no longer an illusion but optimism  that is based on real factors. Ossetians from Tskhinvali, Java,  and Akhalgori will arrive in Tbilisi without fear. This is how  it was in the past and this is how it will be in the future. I  will add that I have three daughters and I would like one at  least to be married in her father's native region. You will see  how many Ossetians will be my guests there....    [Kobulia] May God hear you!</p>

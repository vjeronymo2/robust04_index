			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / How To Spend It: Step out in style AS A RELIEF from all those teetering wedge and platform-heeled shoes that the fashion pundits would have us don this summer, I offer Keds as my contribution to foot welfare. Keds have long been a cult shoe in the US, but in the UK they are only just beginning to be well-known. Keds have lots of things going for them, not least is price. The most expensive versions - in soft Nubuck leather - are Pounds 39.95 a pair and the least expensive - the canvas and denim range - are just Pounds 19.95. At these sort of prices it is possible to build up a small collection to go with every outfit. Apart from the price, Keds are also welcome because the range, leather and canvas alike, is completely machine-washable and machine dryable, too. Informal, insouciant, practical and fun, canvas Keds are not the shoes to wear to formal functions but are great for wearing around the house or for doing the shopping or teaming with summer day-clothes. The leather versions, which also have no heel, are slightly more formal in feel and could be teamed with the new, long skirts. In the canvas range, the Champion Oxfords are in all the fashionable, useful colours such as black, grey, khaki, white, navy and red. Then there are also tartans and denims, plain and flowered patterns. For the really young and funky there are also glittery versions in bronze, gunmetal grey and silver. There is also now a new finish which Keds calls 'Sandwashed Silk' though it is important to note that they are not made of silk - the name is derived from the fact that the finish is silk-like in feel. These come in a range of colours (including summery colours such as pale green, butter yellow, navy and red) and cost Pounds 24.95 a pair. The shoes are widely available at branches of Carvela and Russell &amp; Bromley. If anyone has any difficulty in tracking down a local stockist they could ring Shoon, the distributors, on 0458-834019 where Ruth Staple, who is in charge of Customer Service, will do her best to help. Photographed above is a small selection from the canvas range.</p>

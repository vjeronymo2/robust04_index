			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Johnson Matthey looks east - Pounds 25m technical centre outside Tokyo will be catalyst for expansion IN THE green fields of Tochigi prefecture, 75 miles north of Tokyo, a traditional, Japanese-style ceremony will take place today to celebrate Johnson Matthey, the UK advanced materials and precious metals specialist, opening its first technical centre in Asia. The Pounds 25m Kitsuregawa technical centre will be a vital part of its strategy of expanding in Japan and the rest of Asia. Johnson Matthey now does about 90 per cent of its business in Europe and the US; it expects the Asian market to grow to close to a third. The centre will support its operations in car exhaust catalysts, catalysts for fuel cells, and electronics. The company hopes that its presence in Japan will help it to win a larger share of the market for the exhaust catalysts used in Japanese cars manufactured at their transplant factories in Europe. Although it supplies more than a third of total world demand for vehicle catalysts, Johnson Matthey has less than 5 per cent of the Japanese market, where it faces stiff competition from, among others, Allied Signal of the US. It is already supplying catalysts for engines made by Japanese car makers in the US and Europe. But as engines become more complex, the catalysts are increasingly designed by engineers in Japan rather than locally, and the technology is then transferred to the transplants. So to compete in that market the company needed to have technical support in Japan. Japanese standards for catalysts are stringent and the requirements in terms of testing, support and information supplied are the highest in the world, said Mr Alan Fullarton, project director of Johnson Matthey Japan. 'Primarily we need to have very close contacts with the engineers,' he said, pointing out that the decision to set up a technical centre in Japan was welcomed by Japanese car makers. One advantage for the company is that it does not face competition in car exhaust catalysts from Japanese companies, although Toyota does make about 50 per cent of its catalysts in-house. This is hardly true in the electronics business, where there is fierce competition from large domestic compa-nies specialising in precious metals, such as Nippon Mining and Mitsubishi Kasei. But Johnson Matthey believes that its analytical skills and expertise in purifying will help it expand its market share. It also has expertise in developing catalysts for fuel cells, and has built a pilot plant at Kitsuregawa to provide makers of fuel cells with samples which it expects to have to expand in future. Japan is well ahead of other countries in the commercial development of fuel cells, and all the electric power stations in the world which use them are located in Japan, said Mr Fullarton. Commercialisation of fuel cells in Japan could come in the next two or three years, and the company has invested substantially in scientists and evaluation laboratory facilities to prepare for future mass production.</p>

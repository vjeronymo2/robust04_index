			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Sport: Pride of Lions with an English accent - John Hopkins saves the British and Irish selectors the trouble of picking a party to tour New Zealand / Rugby Union TOMORROW morning, those selecting the British Lions' rugby squad to tour New Zealand this summer will announce their choices. Gentlemen, you need not bother. I have picked the party for you. Take the day off. Although it is never easy to pick Lions' teams, I believe the 1993 party is easier to select than, say, those of 1983 and 1989. Players from England - which is vying with New Zealand to be the second-best rugby nation in the world - obviously should form the core of the party. Some ground rules. First, I am selecting solely on ability. Lions' teams have been dogged by regional parochialism. Imagine the scene: selectors representing each of the four home unions gather round the table. As the composition of the party takes shape, one selector realises that there will only be a couple of players from his country. This will reflect badly on him and colours his comments. Since it is impossible for me to predict these outbursts of chauvinism, I have ignored them altogether. How nice it would be to think there will be none and that the best party is chosen. The new laws have encouraged the up-and-under as an attacking tactic. Full-backs who are safe under a high ball are essential. Gavin Hastings is one and so, generally, is Jonathan Webb. And while neither is entirely reliable with the boot (look at Webb against Wasps last Saturday), there will be other goal-kickers in the party. Wings? The Underwood brothers are scorching attackers and deadly finishers. Ieuan Evans, provided his shoulder is all right, would be a good vice-captain. He has led Wales well since he was appointed captain 18 months ago. The fourth wing is a toss-up between Ian Hunter of Northampton and Ireland's Simon Geoghegan. Geoghegan is the better wing, Hunter the more rounded player who can play full-back as well. Since versatility is an asset on tour, I prefer Hunter. Will Carling and Jeremy Guscott are unchallenged as the first-choice partnership in the centre. Scott Gibbs, the sturdy young Welshman, should go. He is a rock-solid tackler, as is Scott Hastings. I give my nod to Hastings, though not by much over the Bath club's promising Phil de Glanville. Stuart Barnes and Rob Andrew are as clear a choice as stand-off halves as Carling and Guscott outside them. They complement one another. Barnes has an edge on a firm pitch because of the way he can get his line moving. He demonstrated this brilliantly at Twickenham against Scotland. Andrew is a doughty competitor and a good goal-kicker. The competition between them will be keen. Gary Armstrong is the obvious first choice at scrum-half. Will the other be Dewi Morris, whose tendency to play as a ninth forward can be so useful, or Robert Jones, the quick-passing technician? Jones could have lost his chance by operating behind a beaten pack for most of the season. Morris is my choice. No. 8? A man like Dean Richards is an essential component of a team in New Zealand where at least some of the games will be played in mud. His upper-body strength and ability to tie-up the ball will be invaluable. With training every day, he should get a bit fitter, too. If, however, the ground is dry and the game is expected to be fast and loose, then Ben Clarke would be an acceptable choice at No. 8. He could even play blindside flanker with Richards at the back. Is Wade Dooley a spent force? I think not. If there are four better line-out forwards in the home countries, then I am a Dutchman. He will benefit from regular competition, which he does not get with Preston Grasshoppers. Martin Bayfield should go along with Martin Johnson, who is known and respected in New Zealand. Candidates for the fourth place as a lock include Gareth Llewellyn, who has blossomed this season as captain of Neath; Neil Francis of Ireland; and the Scots, Doddie Weir and Damian Cronin. Francis is my man. Kenny Milne and Brian Moore are certainties as the hookers, Jeff Probyn and Jason Leonard as two of the props. I think that Nick Popplewell, the fiery Irishman, and Paul Burnell of Scotland, should join them. Flankers? Peter Winterbottom picks himself because he is one of the best in the world. I think Neil Back deserves a chance to demonstrate his phenomenal workrate on the open-side. Mike Teague is another New Zealand style forward, a man who blossomed on tour in Australia four years ago and could do so again this summer. Emyr Lewis was a leading candidate four months ago but has not played at his best this season. Tim Rodber has come on at Northampton under the aegis of Wayne Shelford and, like Clarke, could play either at No 8 or flanker. He deserves a chance. Now, having picked the team one must address the ticklish question of the captaincy. It is true that Carling is the most successful captain in world rugby. But that does not take in to account that he does not seem entirely at ease with it and, more to the point, what goes with it  - the media and all that. Hastings manages to do both with less apparent discomfort. It might be a horrible mistake or it might be a moment of inspired thinking to make Hastings the captain and give Carling a break from captaincy to concentrate entirely on his own game. I plump for Hastings. So there you are Lions' selectors, I have done the job for you in half the time and at no cost. The party comprises 21 Englishmen, five Scots, two Welshmen and two Irishmen. I must now duck my Irish and Welsh friends and colleagues for having picked only two men from their country but I did say I would select strictly on merit. Thus the composition of my party is (English unless otherwise stated): G Hastings, (Scotland) capt, J Webb, R Underwood, T Underwood, I Evans, (Wales), I Hunter, W Carling, J Guscott, S Gibbs (Wales), S Hastings, (Scotland) S Barnes, R Andrew, G Armstrong (Scotland), D Morris, J Probyn, J Leonard, N Popplewell (Ireland), P Burnell (Scotland), B Moore, K Milne (Scotland), W Dooley, M Bayfield, M Johnson, N Francis (Ireland), P Winterbottom, N Back, M Teague, T Rodber, B Clarke, D Richards.</p>

To  "punish" one of the warring sides in the tripartite civil war is  odious. To attempt do this by air strikes, even "surgical"  strikes, in a country seemingly created for carrying out  guerrilla wars on the ground is worse than stupidity. So what  can be done?    The photograph shows the spot in Sarajevo where six children  died from a mine explosion at the end of January. The Muslim  authorities accused the Serbs, while the Serbs accused Muslim  fanatics who, according to them, are killing their own people in  an attempt to get Serbian positions bombed. That very day  Bosnian Government head Haris Silajdzic called for air strikes.  In a letter to the UN and NATO secretaries general he asked:  "What else has to happen before the UN resolutions (on the use  of aircraft in Bosnia -- S.S.) are finally carried out?"    The next bloody tragedy was not long in coming -- 68 people  were killed and around 200 wounded in one of Sarajevo's crowded  marketplaces. Some people are trying with brutal methodicalness  to embroil the United Nations and NATO in the Bosnian chaos.  They are bent not so much even on provoking air strikes "to get  the siege of Sarajevo lifted" as on embroiling them precisely in  the war. It is clear to anyone with the slightest knowledge of  the real situation that if NATO aircraft start bombing Serbian  positions around the city it will not be possible to avoid heavy  civilian casualties. It will be extremely difficult to hold back  well armed detachments of Serbs by discipline alone and under a  single command. Groups of "avengers" will start "punishing" UN  soldiers, who will overnight have been transformed from neutral  forces into military adversaries...    Moreover, "lifing the siege of Sarajevo" is a purely  superficial pretext. To achieve this you need sufficient  goodwill on the part of the warring sides. The Serbs have  already stated that they are ready to hand Sarajevo over to UN  control, given security guarantees for the Serbian part of the  the city. Paradoxical as it may seem at first sight, the Muslim  leadership has a different perspective on the problem of lifting  the siege. Not so long ago Rasim Delic, the commander of the  Bosnian Muslim Army, let drop the following remark in  conversation with local journalists: "It is of no advantage to  us at all to break through the encirclement, for more than half  the population of the city will then leave."    The Delic plan, which has been referred to many times in the  press, is to increase the scale of the war, to carry it into the  territory of Croatia and Serbia (Kosovo), to upgrade the  200,000-strong Muslim army's weapons by getting the arms embargo  on Bosnia lifted, and to exact military revenge on the  battlefield. The threat this poses to the Balkans is well known  from history. Fortunately, NATO contains enough level-headed  politicians who are conscious of the potential consequences of  simple solutions in Bosnia such as bombing the Serbian guns  around Sarajevo and who are ready patiently to seek ways that  are actually capable of leading to a settlement of the very  complex Bosnian problem.    On Wednesday the North Atlantic bloc have the opportunity to  propose such a way. It will consider a French proposal which  chimes with the recent Russian initiative and amounts to putting  pressure on all three Bosnian sides rather than just the Serbian  one. NATO members will probably agree to demand that both  Serbian and Muslim heavy armaments be placed under UN control  within one month. So we will very quickly be able to see for  ourselves who seeks peace and who wants to prolong the war.</p>

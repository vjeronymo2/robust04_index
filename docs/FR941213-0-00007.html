			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) To reduce injuries and deaths resulting from motor vehicles being driven in excess of posted speed limits (Speed Control), (2) to encourage the proper use of occupant protection devices (including the use of safety belts and child restraint systems) by occupants of motor vehicles and to increase public awareness of the benefit of motor vehicles equipped with air bags (Use of Occupant Protection Devices), (3) to reduce deaths and injuries resulting from persons driving motor vehicles while impaired by alcohol or a controlled substance (Driving While Impaired), (4) to reduce deaths and injuries resulting from accidents involving motor vehicles and motorcycles (Motorcycle Safety), (5) to reduce injuries and deaths resulting from accidents involving school buses (School Bus Safety) and (6) to improve law enforcement services in motor vehicle accident prevention, traffic supervision, and post-accident procedures (Police Traffic Services). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary had already designated four of these six program areas as priority programs, but not Speed Control or School Bus Safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, on January 14, 1994, NHTSA and FHWA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  requesting comments from the public on whether to expand the list of National Priority program areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agencies explained that they apply three criteria to determine whether a program area should be identified as a National Priority program under 23 CFR Part 1205:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Whether the problem is of national concern (including the relative magnitude of the problem);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Whether effective countermeasures have been developed in this area which address this concern; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Whether State programs in the area appear to be among the most effective in reducing crashes, injuries, and fatalities as compared to other traffic safety program areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NPRM proposed to expand the list of National Priority program areas to include Speed Control, and requested comments on the agencies' preliminary determination that School Bus Safety should not be added as a National Priority program area at this time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Comments Received  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agencies received 34 comments to the docket in response to the NPRM, including comments from 22 State agencies (with responsibility for transportation/highway safety, law enforcement and education); a local PTA Council; a county health department; a private bus operator; and nine national organizations. The national organizations represent highway safety interests (National Association of Governors' Highway Safety Representatives, Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety and the Center for Auto Safety); law enforcement organizations (International Association of Chiefs of Police and National Sheriffs' Association); and pupil transportation interests (National Association for Pupil Transportation, National Association of State Directors of Pupil Transportation Services and National School Transportation Association).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on our review of the comments received and other available information, NHTSA and FHWA have decided to adopt the proposal published in the NPRM. For the reasons set forth below, the agencies have decided to add Speed Control to the list of National Priority program areas, and not to add School Bus Safety to the list at this time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

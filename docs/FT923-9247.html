			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Arts: La Boheme - Opera THE YOUNG Bohemians in this production are fortunate, as they have managed to rent a genuine artist's studio. Its Northern aspect sheds a chill, grey light across their apartment from a floor-to-ceiling window looking out over the rooftops of Paris. In the best romantic fashion this is a love-nest open to the stars (literally so, as its badly smashed glass has never been repaired). This summer's La Boheme is the second production by Bath City Opera, which is aiming to bring opera to the West Country on a more regular basis than heretofore. To date the company's home has been Bath's Theatre Royal, an incomparably elegant venue, if on the small side for full-scale opera. With that in mind, it is possible to imagine a very special La Boheme there, intimate and poetic, sensitive to the style and manners of the period. Unfortunately that was not the kind of performance that the company put before us, whatever other merits it may have had. The producer, John Pascoe, set out to present a traditional production of quality. And in David Myerscough-Jones's imaginative and realistic designs, beautifully lit by Peter Blackmore, he certainly found it: the instantaneous shift from the attic of the first act to a bustling Parisian street-scene was nothing short of brilliant. For the third act the designer produced an atmospheric scene at the gate to the city, as dawn rose over Notre-Dame in the distance through the early morning winter mists. Half the work is already done for the singers when the mood is as well prepared as this and yet, as the dying Mimi and her Rodolfo worked out the painful twists in their relationship, the drama steadfastly refused to tug at the heart-strings. For Mimi, the company had been fortunate to capture Renee Fleming, of recent Glyndebourne and Royal Opera renown. Now seven months' pregnant, she could not help looking in the bloom of health, while the voice, once into its stride, also put strength ahead of wilting soprano frailty. She was matched by another American guest, Marcus Haddock, a self-confident, almost pushy Rodolfo with a macho stance, and a robust singer too, long-breathed and forceful. Theirs, one felt, was a frank modern romance with little time for 19th-century mores. Even with reduced forces the accompaniment from Klaus Donath and the Bath City Orchestra (rather untidy - later nights may be better) sounded pretty hearty in this small theatre. All the singers, including Motti Kaston's stern Marcello and the phlegmatic Colline of Richard Robson, had to find reserves of strength to ride the orchestral swell. I liked Elena Vink's Musetta, though, haughty when her star was in the ascendant at the Cafe Momus, thoroughly washed-out the morning after the night before. If any other theatre with a stage of this size wants to put on La Boheme, it could have a handsome visual production ready-made. For Bath City Opera it is on to Rossini's La Cenerentola later this year and hopes of success for a very welcome new operatic venture. Performances continue at the Theatre Royal until August 8 Box Office 0225-448844</p>

			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Heseltine sees dilemma on PO privatisation MR Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, admitted in the Commons yesterday that the government faced a 'dilemma' over the privatisation of the post office. He explained that the problem at the heart of the matter was that of honouring pledges that the universality of price and service provided in all parts of the country was 'non-negotiable', while relieving the post office of the constraints imposed by the public sector so that it could become more competitive. Mr Heseltine rejected a demand by Mr Robin Cook, the shadow trade and industry secretary, that the whole idea should be dropped following the recent disclosure that the necessary legislation would not be introduced in the next parliamentary session. Two Tory backbenchers, Mr David Nicholson (Taunton) and Mr Patrick Cormack (Staffordshire South), expressed reservations about changing the post office's present status. Mr Simon Hughes, for the Liberal Democrats, urged a relaxation of the constraints associated with the public sector and insisted that 'privatising the post office would be a privatisation too far'. Mr Heseltine accused Mr Hughes of providing a classic example of 'trying to have it both ways'. As for it being a privatisation too far, he emphasised: 'We will decide whether we are going to embark on the journey or not'. Mr Heseltine described suggestions that the post office could be given commercial freedom without being privatised as being divorced from the reality of public sector accounting. He said: 'There has never been a government which has been able to set free a public sector enterprise outside the discipline of the public expenditure round and Treasury control.' Mr Heseltine also stressed that the post office was coming under increasing competition from technology such as fax machines and courier services. In a written reply Sir John Cope, paymaster general, cited 'commercial confidentiality' when refusing to disclose the additional costs incurred by the post office as a result of the recent VAT changes in the treatment of intra-EC freight transport services. Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, yesterday urged British Coal to move 'rapidly' to place on the market mines like Bevercotes in Nottinghamshire which it no longer requires. Mr Richard Alexander (C Newark) complained that private sector interests were not being given an early opportunity to view mines which British Coal planned to close at the end of the month.</p>

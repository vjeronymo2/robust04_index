			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Views" column: "Revision"] </F>   [Text] Greece has become involved in the Balkan crisis.  The issue of Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia--FYROM] and the aggravation of our relations with  Albania have dragged Greece into the European and international  arbitration of the litigious Balkan countries.    This is the harsh reality. Our country's Balkan policy has  drifted along filled with contradictions and without a strategy  or long-term goals. It failed in its goal and missed its  opportunities to play a beneficial role in the Balkan  developments and the economic and democratic reconstruction of  the Balkan countries.    This was revealed and indirectly admitted by Prime Minister  Andreas Papandreou in his address at PASOK's [Panhellenic  Socialist Movement] Third Congress. Papandreou said:    "No contradiction can hide the fact that the Greeks have  begun to find their natural role in the Balkans. Half of the  foreign investments in Bulgaria now are Greek. In Albania,  Greek companies have set up 54 joint companies, making us second  after Italy. In Romania, there are 700 joint Greek-Romanian  companies."    Private initiative revealed Greece's natural role in the  Balkans. The state, various Greek administrations, and political  leadership have not yet realized what Greece's natural role in  the Balkans is. They have not been able to deal with the  histrionic and offensive loose tongues of our neighbors by  countering with daring economic and political openings to the  Balkan countries.    In his letter to Papandreou, U.S. President Bill Clinton  accepts the Greek plans for the establishment of joint  Greek-U.S. companies in the Balkans. This economic cooperation  will be at the center of their talks during the meeting they  will have this week in Washington.    But how will these plans proceed? How will the natural role  in the Balkans of Greece and the Greek people be able to come to  the fore now that Greece is involved in the Balkan crisis? The  Greek Government should overcome this contradiction with a  daring revision of Greece's Balkan policy. This is the only way  for Greece's role in the Balkans to dominate and contribute to  the peace and development of the Balkans, and this would be  beneficial to our national aims too.</p>

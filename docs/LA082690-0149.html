			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> MUNICIPAL JUDGES GAIN 2 DISPARATE REPUTATIONS;  </P> <P> COURTS: CRITICS SAY THE BENCH PENALIZES DEFENDANTS WHO GO TO TRIAL. THE  JURISTS, WHO HANDLE ONE OF THE HEAVIEST CASELOADS IN THE STATE, DENY IT.  </P> <P> The 12 judges of the Ventura County Municipal Court often take flak for their  rulings from critics who call them unfair, overly harsh and even capricious.  </P> <P> Last November, an article in California magazine picked Judge John J. Hunter as  one of the three most unfair and abusive judges in the state.  </P> <P> In June, Judge Arturo F. Gutierrez was criticized for delaying execution of a  sentence for a convicted drunk driver who then allegedly killed a high school  student in a drunk-driving accident.  </P> <P> And last week, legal scholars dunned Judge Steven E. Hintz for letting a  prosecutor serve as foreman of a jury that took 15 minutes to convict a man of  being under the influence of heroin.  </P> <P> In fact, the Ventura County Municipal Court has two reputations.  </P> <P> One is that its judges are tough, vindictive men who penalize defendants with  stiffer sentences for going to trial instead of pleading guilty. The unofficial  slogan around the courthouse is: "Ventura County: Arrive on vacation, leave on  probation."  </P> <P> The other is that the judges are hard-working, competent and fair, handling  more than 200,000 criminal, civil and traffic cases per year in the pressure  cooker that an ever-increasing caseload has made of the court.  </P> <P> Indeed, Ventura County's caseload per judge is among the highest in California,  outranking even the crowded municipal courts of Los Angeles by nearly 40%.  </P> <P> In the 1988-1989 fiscal year, 16,797 cases were filed per judge in Ventura  County Municipal Court, while 12,125 cases were filed per judge in the Los  Angeles Municipal Court, according to the California Judicial Council.  </P> <P> The Ventura County Municipal Court handles all misdemeanors, traffic tickets  and small claims cases, and arraigns felony defendants who are headed for  Superior Court.  </P> <P> On a recent weekday at the main Ventura County Courthouse and the courthouse in  Simi Valley, one Municipal Court judge was meticulously working his way through  a two-foot-thick stack of cases, another was sternly sentencing a third-time  drunk driver to 120 days in jail and a third was patiently listening to the  morning's 12th plea of "guilty with an explanation."  </P> <P> On some days, the caseload can grow so heavy that judges are forced to handle  nearly one case per minute. And sometimes defendants get little more than  "assembly line justice," say prosecutors, defense attorneys and the court's own  judges. "Assembly-line justice is a shocking and horrible way to have to  describe it, but in today's times, it's far too often true," Judge Barry B.  Klopfer said.  </P> <P> "We have to, by the sheer volume of cases, deal with each as expeditiously and  routinely . . . as possible while still trying as hard as we can to maintain a  sense of the individuality of each case," Klopfer said.  </P> <P> Klopfer's assignment is handling criminal trials, which he says is a little  slower-paced than his last assignment, which ended in June when he was rotated  out of the job of "master calendar" judge in charge of scheduling criminal  cases for trial.  </P> <P> "You start a day down there realizing that if every case that is on the  calendar is to proceed to a jury trial, that that day's worth of cases could  easily tie up the available trial courts for weeks," Klopfer said.  </P> <P> "These judges are today just high-paid bureaucrats," Dist. Atty. Michael D.  Bradbury said. "They're one cog in this system that deals with a tremendous  volume of cases and they're assembly-line workers. And to stay alive, they have  to turn out 5,000 widgets a day. So what tends to be sacrificed is the quality  of justice. . . . And frequently, the public goes away feeling they haven't had  their day in court."  </P> <P> And while the caseload increases steadily -- 999 cases were awaiting trial at  the end of the 1988-89 fiscal year, up from 794 cases at the end of 1986-87 --  the court has not added a new judge's position since 1981.  </P> <P> "We should have had 16 or 17 judges in this court for the past few years and  obviously we don't," Presiding Municipal Court Judge Lee E. Cooper Jr. said.  </P> <P> "With seven trial divisions in this court, as a system we have the capacity to  try 500 trials a year. There are nearly 13,000 cases set for trial," Cooper  said. "There's gotta be some give . . . somewhere."  </P> <P> The system often "gives" before trial, during what judges call "early  disposition." Without some flexibility in the disposition of cases, the  Municipal Court would collapse, Cooper said.  </P> <P> Because Bradbury refuses to let his prosecutors negotiate pleas with  defendants, a higher percentage of cases go to trial in Ventura County than in  any other county in the state.  </P> <P> In most counties, 5% to 7% of criminal cases go to trial. In Ventura County,  12% to 15% go to trial, while the rest are "disposed of" through guilty pleas  by the defendants or dismissals by the court or prosecutors.  </P> <P> Some critics say the Municipal Court judges penalize defendants for refusing to  plead guilty and save the court the time and expense of a trial.  </P> <P> Ventura County Public Defender Kenneth Clayman said, "The judges like to  demonstrate to you that if you go to trial and lose, you're going to do worse  than if you plead out." A defendant who pleads out is basically entering a  guilty plea.  </P> <P> Clayman quoted a joke making the rounds of the Ventura County Courthouse: in  Municipal Court, "The three most heavily punished offenses are driving under  the influence, being under the influence of heroin and trial by jury."  </P> <P> Another defense attorney complained, "The court punishes people for having a  trial . . . because if more people had trials here it would break the back of  the system and there is no way they can afford to."  </P> <P> Bradbury's no plea-bargaining policy prevents judges from letting defendants  plead to lesser charges, said the attorney, who asked not to be identified.  "They can only scare the defendant by showing that if he doesn't accept what  the district attorney wants, they'll get more" time in jail, she said.  </P> <P> Defense attorney Phillip R. Dunn said giving stiffer sentences for people found  guilty at trial is "extremely offensive. This is occurring with greater  frequency than it used to . . . I think they have lots of reasons they state  officially as to why they do this. But the truth is that they are trying to  coerce people not to go to trial."  </P> <P> Dunn cited a recent case in which his client chose to fight a first-offense  drunk-driving charge in a trial because his blood-alcohol level was very close  to the legal level.  </P> <P> "The guy didn't even testify. All he did was require the people to prove their  case against him," Dunn said.  </P> <P> The man was convicted. But instead of the standard sentence of probation and  fines for a first offense, he was sentenced to six days in County Jail, Dunn  said. Dunn said he was able to persuade the judge to reduce the penalty to a  suspended six-month jail sentence, but the man will have to serve the sentence  if he violates the terms of his probation.  </P> <P> Judges and some attorneys vehemently deny the penalty-for-trial theory, saying  critics have it backward. Instead, they say, defendants are rewarded with  lighter sentences for pleading guilty than they would face if they went to  trial.  </P> <P> Judges often learn of aggravating evidence during trial, and sometimes boost  the sentence accordingly, Judge Thomas Hutchins said.  </P> <P> The Ventura County Municipal Court bench "is extremely fair and scrupulous  about making sure people don't get punished because they went to trial," said  Hutchins, who is the newest Municipal Court judge in Ventura County, having  been appointed from the district attorney's office 11 months ago.  </P> <P> Bradbury said, "It's obvious that if the court is penalizing defendants for  exercising their constitutional right to jury trials that that would be serious  misconduct . . . I have heard that suggested before, but I don't have any  evidence of it."  </P> <P> Cooper said, "A judge in a high-volume arraignment court does not have time to  analyze each crime. That's a function of volume."  </P> <P> He said of lighter sentences, "Most judges give the defendant the benefit of  that in exchange for an early disposition . . . I think the perception that we  penalize people for going to trial is wrong."  </P> <P> And Cooper added, "One of the first steps in rehabilitation is to get a person  to concede he's wrong and accept whatever penalty is imposed for wrongdoing."  </P> <P> Cooper and Klopfer also agreed that during trial judges often learn  incriminating facts that would not have surfaced in a guilty plea. Those facts  often prompt them to increase a defendant's sentence.  </P> <P> Many Ventura County lawyers also complain the Municipal Court bench is  generally too harsh, too intent on jailing convicts to sentence them fairly or  work toward rehabilitation.  </P> <P> "They tend on occasion to be a little bit too severe in some of their  sentencing," said James Farley, a defense attorney who works for a group of  court-appointed lawyers called Conflict Defense Associates.  </P> <P> He said judges in Los Angeles County often pass lighter sentences than they do  in Ventura County. "I think they sometimes take pride in the fact that they are  a tough bench, and I think that that sometimes creates problems in that one  case . . . where punitive is not really the approach that should be taken,"  Farley said.  </P> <P> "It sort of appears that for the most cases they are interested more in jail  time," said another veteran defense attorney, who asked not to be identified.  "Some judges don't want to use the work-release program that was instituted by  the Probation Department for minor, non-security risk-type offenders. . . .  Everything for them is jail. They don't consider any of the alternatives."  </P> <P> Bradbury said of the Municipal Court judges: "For many years, they have  probably imposed the longest average sentences in California for  driving-under-the-influence cases."  </P> <P> Cooper said the court often sentences second-time drunk drivers to 30 days in  jail, instead of the prescribed 48 hours. "Most are going to go in for 30 days  because the consequence of a third offense is 120 days," Cooper said.  </P> <P> "There are some things you have to do" to impress drunk drivers with the  seriousness of their crimes -- and with the seriousness of repeated offenses,  he said.  </P> <P> Some lawyers say the judges' penchant for tough sentences comes from the  experience many of them gained while working as prosecutors in the district  attorney's office.  </P> <P> But others say the judges are merely responding to the law-and-order atmosphere  the county's residents expect them to maintain.  </P> <P> Defense attorney George Eskin, who served as Ventura County's assistant  district attorney in the late 1960s, said, "I think if they were as harsh and  punitive across the board as they're made out to be, then the criminal justice  system in Ventura County would come to a halt" because defense attorneys would  take more cases to trial.  </P> <P> "The court is responsive to what it perceives as the public expectations of  what the court system is supposed to be," Eskin said. "I have a feeling that if  I were a judge that my sentences just generally would be consistent with what  you see in Ventura."  </P> <P> Presiding Judge Cooper said Municipal Court judges often are tougher sentencers  than their city counterparts. "In Los Angeles, it's practically impossible to  put people in jail on misdemeanors" because the county's jails are so crowded,  he said. "You come here, it's a different reality."  </P> <P> And Cooper cited a recent FBI report showing Ventura County to have the lowest  crime rate of any heavily populated county in the western United States.  </P> <P> Steepling his hands under his chin, Cooper leaned back and concluded, "Until  someone can demonstrate to me there is not a causal relationship between what  we do and the low crime rate, I'm prepared to indulge a perception that there  is."  </P></p>

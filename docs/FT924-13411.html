			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Small companies The withdrawal of a third large securities firm from the smaller companies sector raises the question of how much further the system of competing market makers put in place at the time of Big Bang will be eroded. Following UBS Phillips and Drew's decision, another 40 companies could be added to the list of 159 stocks traded on the order-driven bulletin board or quoted on SEAQ by just one marketmaker. As it stands, the bulletin board is hardly satisfactory, not least because an order-driven system only provides a reliable basis for pricing shares if there is a steady flow of orders. Institutional investors are reluctant to deal in size, which has damaged liquidity further. Smaller companies which paid out expensive listing fees feel aggrieved at being relegated. If this dissuades all but the biggest companies from seeking a public quote, the depth of the market would be under threat in the longer term. The Stock Exchange is only too aware of the problem. The system of specialist marketmakers for individual stocks proposed yesterday may go some way to slowing the attrition of capital from this end of the market. Making a market in a small company will certainly look more attractive if the specialist marketmaker is given the privilege of taking part in all trades at its quoted price. If this helps restore confidence in the reliability of market prices, so much the better. Ultimately, however, the problem is not one of market structure, but lack of investor interest at all but the most bullish stage of the cycle.</p>

			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / EU Summit: Search for new voting formula defeats leaders - FT writers report on the first day of the European Union leaders' meeting in Brussels EU leaders were struggling yesterday to find a compromise on voting rules in the Council of Ministers which will preserve the interests of both big and small member states if up to four new members - Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway - join the 12 in 1995. The Maastricht treaty has brought in more weighted majority voting on EU decisions, and the five big members want to preserve their influence when the four small countries join. Most of the small member states, as well as the four applicants, fear Europe's balance of influence could be destroyed, leading to a return to 19th-century balance-of-power politics in which the EU would come to be dominated by a 'directoire' of the big states, mainly Germany, France and the UK. Underlying the controversy is the need to adapt institutions designed for the original six member states not only to the 16 in prospect, but beyond that to possible additional members from eastern Europe. Germany, supported by France, has after some initial sabre-rattling opted to remit any fundamental reform to the next EU constitutional review in 1996. Bonn fears that otherwise the four applicant countries could lose the referendums they are to hold on accession. But the UK and Spain both maintained their hard line against a Belgian presidency compromise which would extend the existing rules for 12 to cover 16 members. That would set the 'blocking minority' needed to halt a decision at 27 votes out of 90, instead of 23 out of 76 now. The current formula usually requires two big countries and one small one for a blocking minority, and the UK wants this preserved. Spain will accept the 27 threshold, so long as it always contains the votes of two big countries. An Italian compromise for all member states to surrender one vote looked unlikely to mollify smaller states; Luxembourg, for instance, would have its votes halved.</p>

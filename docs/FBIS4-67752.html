			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article from Brussels EUROPE: "EP Calls for a </F> Uniform EU Position for NPT Revision in 1995"]    [Text] Following its rapporteur, Carlos Robles Piquer on  the revision of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) at  the conference for revision scheduled for 1995, the European  Parliament took an explicit stand in favour of a Community  position that is as uniform as possible at this conference. It  also noted with satisfaction that the European Commission has  carried out preliminary action along these lines which will  allow dialogue with the other Community institutions. The EP,  that is particularly concerned about the "immense" risks  entailed by the collapse of the Soviet system for the control of  nuclear exports and the possibility that some of the 2000 to  3000 USSR specialists in the nuclear weapons field will turn  into "nuclear mercenaries," calls on the Union to insist upon  the establishment of a universal control regime of the complete  uranium and plutonium cycle for civilian use (also possibly of  thorium), including material from the military cycle further to  the partial dismantling of military arsenals. The EP notes that  between 27,000 and 30,000 nuclear tactical and strategic weapons  are stockpiled in the former Soviet Union alone. It also  stresses the importance that the European Energy Charter  attaches to nuclear energy and its safety, and the strategic  role that this form of energy plays in energy supply and in the  CIS' export potential.    In its resolution, the EP calls on the European Union, on  the  basis of Article VII of the NPT, to carry out political action  aimed at encouraging the creation of denuclearised zones: The  Parliament notes that, further to South Africa's accession to  NPT, the African continent may be considered as a denuclearised  zone, and calls on the Union for vigorous diplomatic action so  that Brazil may follow the example of Cuba which joined the  Tlatelolco Treaty. This would also make Latin America a nuclear  weapon-free region. The EP states that the EU should include  conditionality clauses on nuclear non-proliferation in  cooperation agreements with third countries and that the  cooperation actions eventually established by these agreements  in nuclear energy matters should be strictly limited to the use  of this type of energy for peaceful purposes. Such clauses  should particularly be included in agreements with the CIS and  Eastern European countries and the International Centre for  Science and Technology in Moscow should make it possible for  nuclear experts to specialize in energy applications. In  addition, Parliament notes that:    - in the context of the Middle East peace talks, a  denuclearized zone should be created in the region;    - the Commission departments responsible for security checks  in the framework of the Euratom Treaty should apply the  provisions on controls of exports of nuclear material to North  Korea as stringently as possible.    Lastly, the EP calls for useless duplication between the  IAEA  (International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna) and the security  control mechanisms established under Article 77 of the Euratom  Treaty to be avoided.</p>

			<p><P> August 31, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> EECO REVEALS PLAN TO REPAY ITS CREDITORS  </P> <P> EECO Inc., the computer products maker that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy  protection in May, said Thursday it has filed a reorganization plan to repay  creditors and hopes to emerge from bankruptcy proceedings by the end of the  year.  </P> <P> Scott O. Davis, chief financial officer, said the plan calls for the company to  pay $7.5 million to its largest secured creditor, Sanwa Bank in Los Angeles,  and take out a loan of $3.5 million to satisfy the remainder of Sanwa's  $11-million claim.  </P> <P> To satisfy its second-largest creditor, businessman Gary Beeson, the company  will turn over ownership of its computer keypad manufacturing plant in Phoenix  to Beeson, who is owed $6.5 million from the sale of his video-editing business  to EECO. The company plans to lease back the facility from Beeson.  </P> <P> The company's unsecured creditors claim they are owed a total of $9.5 million.  Davis said the plan would pay unsecured creditors an amount equal to about 11  cents on the dollar. That amount would be paid in a note tied to the expected  sale of EECO's hotel computer subsidiary and EECO stock.  </P> <P> Steve Bergh, attorney for the creditors committee, could not be reached for  comment.  </P> <P> The reorganization plan is subject to approval by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in  Santa Ana and EECO creditors.  </P></p>

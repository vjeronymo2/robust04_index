			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / China has more than a million 'millionaires' COMMUNIST China has more than a million renminbi millionaires 'according to the most conservative estimates', an official mainland survey said yesterday, Reuter reports from Hong Kong. Some in the booming southern city of Shenzhen were in the 10m renminbi (Pounds 1.2m) bracket, the China News Service quoted a mainland magazine as saying. Average per capita income for Chinese rose above 2,000 renminbi for the first time last year, driven by 12.8 per cent economic growth. A million renminbi is worth Pounds 120,000 at the official rate. 'The slogan of a few years ago - that some people must get rich before others - has become a reality but the level of wealth has far exceeded expectations,' the report added. It said many mainland Chinese were on waiting lists for China's new golf courses, with membership fees of Pounds 21,000 to Pounds 28,000</p>

			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Observer: Then only six It was only going to be a matter of time before one or other of the UK Treasury's panel of 'seven wise men' was called away to impart his wisdom in another corner of the globe. Retired Cambridge professor Wynne Godley will be ensconced for at least the next year at the Jerome Levy Economics Institute in New York state, and has advised the Treasury that he cannot afford the air fare to the London meetings, tomorrow and next week, of the panel of outside economists. But the engaging Godley, who has foretold the UK's economic travails better than most, has no intention of stepping down voluntarily. He intends to communicate by fax, a decision which may not go amiss with Treasury chief economic adviser Alan Budd, who chairs the discussions and has on occasion had to use all his charm to put a lid on the simmering feud between Godley and fellow wise man Tim Congdon. Chancellor Kenneth Clarke may, however, seek more commitment from the panel he is to meet for the first time tomorrow week. So, should he want to boot out the Cambridge gloomster, where should he turn? Flicking through the diary to October 14, Clarke will see he is meeting Andrew Dilnot, bright young director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, who will be arguing the case for increased taxes in next month's Budget. What better opportunity to impress the cabinet minister on a subject supposedly dear to his heart?</p>

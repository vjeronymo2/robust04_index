			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / International Company News: Kuhne &amp; Nagel in public offer Kuhne &amp; Nagel, the international freight forwarding group, is going public with a placing this week of 181,000 bearer shares - 18 per cent of the enlarged capital - in Zurich and Frankfurt at SFr775 a share. The group, in which Mr Klaus-Michael Kuhne will retain a majority stake, also posted a 15.5 per cent rise in consolidated net income last year to SFr44.6m (Dollars 30.9m) on sales up 1.1 per cent to SFr4.9bn. Mr Bruno Salzmann, finance director, forecast that net income would rise a further 12 per cent this year, suggesting the placing price was 15.5 times expected 1994 earnings. Mr Kuhne, 57, decided on the placing as part of the arrangements to ensure an orderly succession. He has no heirs. Viag Bayernwerk Beheer of Holland acquired 33 per cent of the capital in 1992 when Lonrho of the UK, which had held a 50 per cent stake since 1981, withdrew. Viag has first refusal on Mr Kuhne's shares, and its policy is for the public to hold large minority stakes in its subsidiaries. The placing consists of 91,000 existing bearer shares, being sold by Deutsche Handelsbank, and 90,000 new shares. Following the placing, Mr Kuhne will hold 51.6 per cent of the capital and 56.7 per cent of the votes. Viag will have 30.3 per cent of the capital and 33.4 per cent of the votes. Mr Salzmann said the group's medium-term targets were for annual cash flow of SFr90m to SFr95m and a 10 per cent annual rise in net income. It planned a 40 per cent to 50 per cent distribution of profit in dividends.</p>

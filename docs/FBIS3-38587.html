			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [George Jones article: "The Feuding Has To Stop, Major Tells </F> Tory MP's"]    [Text] Mr Major sought to bolster his leadership last  night with an impassioned appeal to Tory MPs to stop their  feuding which, he said, could result in the Tories being thrown  out of offlce at the next election.    He served notice that ministers whose personal or political  behaviour fell below acceptable standards would be asked to  resign immediately and not try to ride out unfavourable  publicity.    Mr Major said the Government's "good news" message on the  economy was being drowned out by the trivia, artificial rows,  disagreements and divisions within the party.    The party must transcend personal ambitions and feelings. In  future he would put concern "for the country and party before  the personal feelings of others."    His appeal for unity came as the latest Gallup poll,  published in THE DAILY TELEGRAPH today, showed that the  so-called sleaze factor -- the recent spate of personal and  political scandals involving Tory politicians -- was beginning  to damage the party's standing with the voters.    According to the poll nearly two-thirds of voters --  including more than a quarter of Tory supporters -- believe "the  Conservatives these days give the impression of being very  sleazy and disreputable."    Mr Major, exasperated by weeks of internal bickering and  sniping at his leadership, stepped up his efforts to reassert  his authority by making a direct appeal to the backbench 1922  Committee.    It followed his rebuff on Monday [31 January] for leaders of  the right-wing 92 Group of MPs who had been pressing for a  Cabinet reshuffle. They were shown the door after two minutes.    Usually the party leader delivers an end-of-term message to  the troops, and Mr Major's decision to address MPs last night  was a direct response to calls for him to "take a grip" on his  party.    He told them: "The sniping has to stop. The feuding has to  stop. The squandering of energies on petty factionalism has to  stop.    "We have to unite and fight for what we all believe in. That  means self-discipline, hard work, back to the basics of politics  with a vengeance."    He went on: "I am not prepared to stand quietly by and see  our party squander its power and lose its opportunity for good."    Mr Major rounded on those he accused of criticising him  behind his back. "I do not flinch from criticism but I would  rather have it direct than anonymously, face-to-face rather than  behind the hand."    There was laughter when he added: "I will stop reading the  papers if you will stop talking to them."    In what will be seen as a warning that such feuding could  cost the Tories the next election, he said he had never been in  Opposition but he believed it would be "miserable and  frustrating."    His tough talking delighted most Tory MPs, anxious to be  given a lead after several weeks in which the Government has  been blown off course.    He was given a two-minute standing ovation. Mr Tom King,  former Defence Secretary, said it was just what the party needed.</p>

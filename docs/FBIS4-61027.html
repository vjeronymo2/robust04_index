			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vasiliy Ustyuzhanin report: "I Came, I Saw, I Signed. </F> Religious Leaders Unanimous About Accord Treaty, Politicians  Dubious"]    [Text] Our poor world loves a good argument. Judging by  everything, most leaders of regions and political movements were  guided by precisely this formula when they arrived in St.  George's Hall 28 April to sign the Social Accord Treaty.  Republic presidents, heads of kray and oblast administrations,  and legislative assembly chairmen from virtually every region  signed it. It was not signed only by N. Vinogradov and A.  Tuleyev, chairmen of the legislative assemblies of Vladimir and  Kemerovo Oblasts. Nikolay Vinogradov referred to the fact that  he had not received the blessing of his legislative assembly.  Aman Tuleyev commented clearly: "Let the president look at the  lives of the miners. If something were to change for the better  in their lives, I would sign it."    Nonetheless, all the rest were far more amenable. Why?    N. Fedorov, president of the Republic of Chuvashia:    "The treaty will not do any harm. In general I think that  this is not currently the most important document that we should  be fighting for. The reforms are not working. That is our  headache."    M. Shaymiyev, president of the Republic of Tatarstan:    "Without some kind of agreement in Moscow it will be hard to  advance the reforms in the republics. So my signature is also a  mark of support for the center."    A. Galazov, president of the Republic of North Ossetia:    "Ossetia wants to live in a strong and peaceful Russia. I  hope that the treaty will serve this purpose at least in some  measure."    Yu. Vlasov, head of the Vladimir Oblast Administration: "I  realize that the treaty is not historic. But it would be silly  just now not to support any steps toward consensus."    So in territorial terms the concluded treaty may indeed have  an effect. But what about in political terms? For instance,  Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, leader of the "Yabloko" parliamentary  faction, did not pay his respects to the important Kremlin  meeting at all; Vladimir Lukin, the other leader of the bloc,  did so, but "purely symbolically"; while Vladimir Lysenko,  leader of the Russian Republican Party, which is part of  "Yabloko," appended his monogram. It is easy to predict that,  even if organizational conclusions do not follow, some kind of  action, angry response, or set-to is inevitable.    Gennadiy Zyuganov, leader of the Communist Party of Russia,  also came up with a strong political trump card, which he played  in the lobby: "They're good bedfellows -- Yeltsin, Gaydar, and  Zhirinovskiy. We want nothing to do with it."    Vasiliy Lipitskiy, leader of the "Free Russia" People's  Party, called the treaty an "agreement on the inviolability of  the regime," and does not believe that the Kremlin has taken a  step toward political peace. Nor were the Cossacks unanimous --  some hetman leaders came to St. George's Hall with their swords  drawn, while others did not even think about leaving the  confines of their own groups [pokidat predely svoikh volnits].    Only various religious leaders -- Orthodox, Muslim, and  Buddhist -- were unanimous. They did not make any preconditions  -- they came, they saw, they signed. The head of the Russian  Orthodox Church even made a good speech to mark the occasion.    So the likelihood of the treaty soon being forgotten cannot  be ruled out. A great deal will now depend on the press. It is  clear from the text of the treaty that the president is tasking  it with monitoring the fulfillment of the treaty conditions.  Well, that is something we are used to. That is not our main  problem. The most important thing is that the press is not  finally stifled by means of prices for newsprint and  distribution. Otherwise there will be nobody left to call on  people to be "pro" or "con."</p>

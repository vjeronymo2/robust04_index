			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Exceptional costs push Huntingdon Pounds 71m into red Shares in Huntingdon International Holdings dived 23p to 20p yesterday as exceptional costs of Pounds 70.8m plunged the life sciences group into annual pre-tax losses of Pounds 71.1m, against profits of Pounds 8.68m. The group has also appointed administrators to Travers Morgan, its UK-based consultancy. HIH had been trying to sell Travers Morgan, as well as HEE, its US engineering and environmental services business, but could not find buyers at the right price. The Pounds 70.8m (Pounds 3.01m) exceptional charges consisted of Pounds 33.9m relating to TM and Pounds 36.9m for the restructuring of HEE. Mr Christopher Cliffe, HIH deputy chief executive and finance director, said he would be 'utterly dismayed' if there were to be further charges in the current year. The group said it had made provisions of Pounds 18m since it bought TM in December 1991, and had decided not to inject further funds into the consultancy. Changes in the market in the UK, a general lack of large infrastructure projects, and the government's containment of public expenditure were all cited as causes of weakened overall demand for TM's services. Mr Cliffe said the primary responsibility of the HIH board was to its shareholders and it was 'right and proper' to restrict their exposure to TM and ring-fence the consultancy by administration. He did not think there was 'a large number' of TM creditors. In the year to September 30 TM, which employs 720 people in the UK and 800 worldwide, incurred operating losses of Pounds 1.29m (profits Pounds 2.74m) on turnover of Pounds 34.6m (Pounds 37.2m). HEE made operating losses of Pounds 1.58m (profits Pounds 5.28m) on turnover of Pounds 70.7m (Pounds 79.2m). Mr Cliffe said 'part of the division's problems were attributable to poor management', adding that new management was now in place. Profits from the life sciences side fell to Pounds 8.5m (Pounds 9.1m) on turnover up at Pounds 41.5m (Pounds 39.7m). Group revenues, net of sub-contract costs, totalled Pounds 146.7m (Pounds 156.1m); operating profits tumbled to Pounds 2.53m (Pounds 15.5m). Losses per share were 0.704p (earnings 0.073p), and losses per ADR were 5.311 cents (earnings 0.55 cents). The final dividend is passed.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department shall determine, and the Customs Service shall assess, antidumping duties on all appropriate entries. The Department will issue appraisement instructions on each exporter directly to the Customs Service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective for all shipments of the subject merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the publication date of the final results of these administrative reviews, as provided for by section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) All exports of subject merchandise by firms covered in these reviews will be subject to cash deposit rates as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. for Koyo, NSK, and Nachi-Fujikoshi, see the final results of the 1991/92 review (58 FR 64720, December 9, 1993); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. for Toyota, see the final results of the 1986/87 review (55 FR 38720, September 20, 1990); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. for those firms that have not been covered in reviews of later periods, the cash deposit rates will be those rates established in the final results of the 1985/86 review, as outlined above; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) For previously reviewed or investigated companies not listed in this notice and not reviewed in subsequent periods, the cash deposit rate will continue to be the company-specific rate published for the most recent period; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) If the exporter is not a firm covered in this review, a prior review, or the original LTFV investigation, but the manufacturer is, the cash deposit rate will be the rate established for the most recent period for the manufacturer of the merchandise; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) If neither the exporter nor the manufacturer is a firm covered in this or any previous review conducted by the Department, the cash deposit rate will be the ``all others'' rate. The ``all others'' rate is the ``new shipper'' rate established in the first review conducted by the Department in which a ``new shipper'' rate was established, as discussed below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On May 25, 1993, the CIT, in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Floral Trade Council <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 822 F.Supp. 766 (1993), and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Federal-Mogul Corporation and the Torrington Company <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 839 F.Supp. 864 (1993) decided that once an ``all others'' rate is established for a company, it can only be changed through an administrative review. The Department has determined that in order to implement these decisions, it is appropriate to reinstate the ``all others'' rate from the LTFV investigation (or that rate as amended for correction of clerical errors or as a result of litigation) in proceedings governed by antidumping duty orders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In proceedings governed by antidumping findings, unless we are able to ascertain the ``all others'' rate from the Treasury LTFV investigation, we have determined that it is appropriate to adopt the first ``new shipper'' rate established in the final results of an administrative review of this finding published by the Department (or that rate as amended for correction of clerical errors as a result of litigation) as the ``all others'' rate for the purposes of establishing cash deposits in all current and future administrative reviews. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because this proceeding is governed by an antidumping finding, and we are unable to ascertain the ``all others'' rate from the Treasury LTFV investigation, the ``all others'' rate for the purpose of these reviews is 18.07 percent from  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Tapered Roller Bearings and Certain Components Thereof from Japan, Final Results of Administrative Review of Antidumping Finding <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 49 FR 8976 (March 9, 1984), the first review conducted by the Department in which a ``new shipper'' rate was established. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This notice serves as a final reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR &sect;353.26 to file a certificate regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during these review periods. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This notice also serves as the only reminder to parties subject to administrative protective order (APO) of their responsibility concerning the disposition of proprietary information disclosed under APO in accordance with 19 CFR 353.34(d). Timely written notification of return/destruction of APO materials or conversion to judicial protective order is hereby requested. Failure to comply with the regulations and the terms of the APO is a sanctionable violation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These administrative reviews and this notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1)) and 19 CFR 353.22(c). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: November 2, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Susan G.

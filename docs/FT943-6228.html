			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Population meeting boycott Sudan yesterday became the second Moslem country in two days to boycott next week's International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo. The move follows an attack last week on the conference's programme by President Omar Hassan al-Bashir, Sudan's leader, who said it contradicted moral and religious values, Mark Nicholson writes from Cairo. Sudan's decision not to send a delegation comes a day after that by Saudi Arabia. Saudi officials have so far failed to specify why they will not participate. However, Sudanese officials were quoted yesterday by state media as calling for a generalised boycott of the meeting, which they accused of being a western ploy to curb population growth in the Moslem world. Egyptian Islamic opponents of the conference, however, yesterday failed in an attempt to have it barred from taking place in Cairo as an Egyptian court threw out an attempt by three prominent Islamist lawyers to ban the meeting. Meanwhile, Mrs Tancu Ciller, Turkish prime minister, yesterday said she would not attend the event. An official statement said she would be too busy preparing for the early September opening of parliament to attend. The prime minister of Bangladesh, Mrs Begum Khaleda Zia, has already said she was too 'pressed' at home to attend the meeting.</p>

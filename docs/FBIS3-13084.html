			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Marc Roche on interview with PLO "Finance </F> Minister" Jawid al-Ghusayn in London; date not given: "The  Economy Will Follow, the PLO `Finance Minister' Declared to Us"]    [Text] Jawid al-Ghusayn, PLO "finance minister" and  president of the Palestinian National Fund, is certainly not a  fanatical idealist. A very rich businessman, he lives in London  and displays great moderation. The PLO's big financier, a  liberal, explains that the market economy will be imposed in the  occupied territories but he cautiously stressed that a climate  of confidence is vital and that the settlement of the political  problems is a precondition for any economic development.    "To attract investment and channel funds to lasting  development projects, we want to establish a market economy in  which the private sector and not the public sector will play the  main role." In different times, Jawid al-Ghusayn could have  held court in the room furnished with cushions where the  sultan's council met under the Ottoman occupation, but he does  not give the impression of being idle. There is no sign of  Palestine in this luxury Mayfair apartment, in the fashionable  district of London, with modernist decoration from which no  detail is absent, not even the thirties' furniture and the  abstract paintings.    The president of the Palestinian National Fund, with his  sober suit and his club necktie, blends with the City  financiers. And when this very rich businessman, a member of a  famous family of citrus fruit farmers in the Gaza strip,  mentions the 13 September 1993 agreement between Israel and the  PLO, there is no trace of sentimentality in what he says: "To  establish good cooperation, the psychological environment is  crucial. When you choose an associate, this agreement is based  on confidence, reciprocity, equality between the parties. How  can you build the future if you distrust each other?" If, like  any well-born Palestinian, our interlocutor feels he is partly  British, it is by his phlegm, the almost infectious calmness,  that he shows it: "Let us first solve the political problems  and the economy will follow."  <H5>  Businessman </H5>   Jawid al-Ghusayn? Who is he? We do not even know what the  "Who's Who in the Arab World?" nonchalantly "forgotten" on the  table, says of him. Why is it there? He is not in it. His  history in business is like that of many Palestinian-born  entrepreneurs, uprooted by the creation of the Israeli State in  1948 or the rush to the Persian Gulf oil paradise in the early  fifties. After studying economics at the American University in  Cairo (where he met Yasir 'Arafat), this man, who is completely  bilingual in Arabic and English, made his fortune in the  construction industry, first in Kuwait, then in Abu Dhabi, and  in Qatar. After winning comfortable commissions as  intermediaries between the oil monarchies and the Western  companies, many Palestinian businessmen gained positions in the  public buildings and works sector, import-export, tourism, and  agribusiness, always cropping up where nobody dared to venture.  There is no sign of photographs of 'Arafat, yellowed engravings  of the Dome of the Rock, or ashtrays in PLO colors.    Jawid al-Ghusayn, 63 years old, is not playing at being a  defender of the Palestinian cause, he simply is one, holding an  essential place within Fatah. Our interlocutor, who has been  "PLO finance minister" since 1984, is a legitimate member of the  executive committee. His department provides for the needs of  bodies like the Association of Martyrs' Families, the Liberation  Army, diplomatic missions, the payment of the organization's  cadres, or financial support for the Intifadah.    He is also one of the founder leaders of the Welfare, the  most powerful of the Palestinian charity organizations which  works on aid projects in the sphere of training, healthcare, the  preservation of the heritage in the occupied territories. It is  an association set up by the famous "London Club" -- the  informal set of rich businessmen of Palestinian origin based in  the City.   <H5>    Treasury </H5>   Grouping entrepreneurs like 'Abd-al-Majid Shuman, president  of the Arab Bank Group, Muhsin Kittani and Munib al-Masri,  princes of the public buildings and works sector, and many  others, this "London club" represents considerable economic  influence. Its members, who prefer to work behind the scenes,  have a bridgehead in Britain -- the former mandatory power --  and ties of confidence with what is called the English  establishment. The private fortune of Palestinians abroad is  estimated to be $10 billion. "One of the great assets of the  future entity," according to John Milne, Bank of England adviser  for the Near East.    "The era of socialism and nationalizations is over.  Everybody is now privatizing," we were told by the big PLO  financier. The organization's war "treasury" is estimated at $5  billion. But the cessation of payments from the Arab countries,  angered by the pro- Iraqi position taken by the PLO during the  Gulf War, forced Jawid al-Ghusayn to reduce spending. Although  he and Abu-al-'Ala', his colleague who is director of the PLO  and Fatah Economic Committee, the man at the center of the  secret talks with Israel, supervise this nest egg, Yasir 'Arafat  is still the man who really has financial power. Jawid  al-Ghusayn tried to be reassuring: "'Arafat, an engineer by  training, was an entrepreneur in Kuwait before taking the reins  of the PLO. He knows what economic liberalism and the free  movement of capital mean."    However, there is no question of discussing big bucks or  corruption. This is what real treasurers are like. "We want to  build an efficient but light government machine. The  inhabitants of the territories will be responsible for the  administration, not expatriate cadres living in Tunis. They  must have priority when hiring starts because they know the  problems..." The businessman may well belong to the generation  educated in the fifties and sixties, the great era of  pan-Arabism, the Ba'th movement, and Nasirism, but his sober  control of the Palestinian movement has always constantly been  exercised in the direction of moderation. As befits a gentleman.</p>

			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Bristol &amp; West hit by fourfold jump in bad debt charge PRE-TAX PROFITS at Bristol &amp; West, the UK's 10th largest building society, plunged by 67 per cent during the first six months of the year after it was forced to make a fourfold increase in its bad debt charge. Profits for the six months to June 30 1992 amounted to Pounds 13.1m, down from Pounds 39.2m last time. The bad debt charge was up from Pounds 7.2m to Pounds 29.7m. Almost all the provisions were against residential lending as a result of the fall in the value of repossessed homes. They also included a general provision of Pounds 9m. Mr Tony Fitzsimons, chief executive, said the society had decided to make substantial provisions at the interim stage this year, even though it had been fully provided at the end of 1991. 'We expect a better second half and the figure for the full year should show an improvement on last year provided there is no further deterioration in the housing market,' he said. City analysts said the result was not so bad as had been feared in some quarters. The fall in profits should be treated as a one-off event because of Bristol &amp; West's decision to introduce a new provisioning formula. Total assets of the society rose from Pounds 6.2bn in June last year to Pounds 7.3bn, although part of the increase came from the takeover of Cheshunt Building Society. Interest income was up by 7.5 per cent to Pounds 64.2m, but non-interest income dropped by 8 per cent to Pounds 34.2m. The society's mortgage book grew from Pounds 5.7bn at the start of the year to Pounds 6bn. There had been a good inflow of retail savings despite the general trend in the industry, said Mr Fitzsimons. Management costs rose by 10 per cent to Pounds 55.6m. This partly reflected the society's policy of opening new retail financial centres and a new non-retail mortgage distribution arm. Hamptons, Bristol &amp; West's 100-branch estate agency chain, incurred a Pounds 2m loss. This was said to be lower than last time.</p>

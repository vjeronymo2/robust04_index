			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We believe that every investigation does seek  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to identify facility practices which led to the resident  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neglect or abuse, or misappropriation of resident property  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and this is evidenced by the guidance currently provided to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the States in manual instructions. These guidelines include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the general procedures for conducting complaint  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investigations and stipulate that, if significant problems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are identified during an initial assessment or other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> observations, the scope of the review is expanded as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary. The procedures also specify that when the team  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is investigating allegations of substandard care, they are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to evaluate not only the care of the individuals involved in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the allegation, but also to evaluate the facility's patterns  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of related care. Also, noncompliance identified during the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey is recorded on the Statement of Deficiencies and Plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Correction (HCFA&hyph;2567) and a plan of correction is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requested. When the facility is not in substantial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance as a result of the deficiencies identified,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforcement actions could include the imposition of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative remedies or termination of a facility's provider  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A few commenters suggested that in those cases  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> where neglect was found and determined to be caused by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factors beyond the control of the individual, the State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency must impose sanctions upon the facility or document  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> why such sanctions are inappropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We do not accept this suggestion to add a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory requirement that obligates HCFA or the State to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impose sanctions where resident neglect was found and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined to be caused by factors beyond the control of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual. Regardless of the cause of the noncompliance, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility is not relieved of its responsibility to correct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its deficiencies. This responsibility assures that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> residents consistently receive quality health care in a safe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environment and it exists whether or not a remedy is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imposed. However, there are instances in which a remedy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be imposed due to the egregious nature of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiency and to encourage prompt compliance. Conversely,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there are situations in which a remedy might not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary because the facility corrected the practice which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> led to the abuse. For example, firing an employee who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neglects a resident or residents could immediately correct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that deficiency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We do not accept the suggestion to incorporate into the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation a provision that would require documentation for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those cases in which a remedy is not imposed. We are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required by the Act to document why sanctions are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imposed and to require this through regulations would impose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a significant workload burden because, as stated above,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there are many cases in which deficiencies are corrected and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedies are not imposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Redesignation of Subpart F  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As noted earlier, a new Subpart D of part 488,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consisting of &sect;&sect;488.201&hyph;488.211, became effective on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> August 31, 1992, shortly after this proposed rule was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> published on August 28. Consequently, we must designate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subpart F, which was to consist of &sect;&sect;488.200&hyph;488.240,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with subsequent numbers. To assist the reader, we are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> publishing the new table of contents for Subpart F, with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designations of the proposed rule shown in parenthesis. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the following discussions, we refer to the sections as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> renumbered, with the proposal's identification included only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if distinction is necessary.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> Sec.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 --> 488.400&blank;Statutory basis.

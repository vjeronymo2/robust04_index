According to Ukrainian Foreign Minister Zlenko, this would  assist with creating a kind of atmosphere that would help to  resolve many problems on the former USSR territory. Ukraine  might be a significant addition to the axis, Foreign Minister  Zlenko suggested. However, he remarked that the issue had not as  yet been settled.    Ukrainian Foreign Minister Zlenko did not sound optimistic  when speaking about possible joining of Russia to the G-7. He  considered Russian-Ukrainian relations to be normal ones between  partners. However, he pointed out that there were some unsettled  problems.    Commenting on the Crimean issue, Ukrainian Foreign Minister  Zlenko said "Russia and Ukraine display tolerance towards the  Crimea." According to him, to resolve the issue as some Crimean  politicians propose to do would mean transgressing the  principles of international law.    Ukrainian Foreign Minister Zlenko confirmed the intention of  Kiev to settle the issue concerning the Black Sea Fleet in  accordance with the Yalta, Massandra and Dagomys agreements. He  said this approach had been agreed upon during his meeting with  Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev in Odessa last autumn.</p>

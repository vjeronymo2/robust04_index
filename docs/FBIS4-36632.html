			<p>BFN     [Text] Ba'labakk, Lebanon, June 11 (AFP) -- Two members of  the Iranian-backed Hizballah tried to kidnap a German woman  historian in the Syrian-controlled al-Biqa' Valley on Saturday,  the woman and witnesses said.    "It was a bad 10 minutes," Nepta Anngret, 45, a historian  from Berlin's museum of ethnography, told AFP.    She was on her way from her hotel in Ba'labakk to the famous  Roman ruins of this ancient al-Biqa' Valley town when two young  men approached her and said: "Hizballah, follow us."    "They were very young guys. One was around 16 and the other  18," Anngret said.    "I refused to follow them so one of the youths grabbed my  arm  and tried to drag me away. Passersby intervened and escorted me  back to the Palmyra (hotel) but one of the guys followed me  there," she said.    She said the other young man drove away in a car but quickly  returned to the hotel to get his friend.    Hotel staff and witnesses confirmed the kidnapping attempt.    Anngret has been staying at the Palmyra Hotel for a week to  carry out research at the Roman temples of Ba'labakk.    "I've been in Lebanon for a month. People here are very nice  and I plan on continuing my research before packing up in 10  days time," she said, stressing that the incident had shaken her  up but not frightened her.    It was the first reported kidnapping attempt of a Westerner  since the last Western hostage was released in 1991 following a  wave of abductions during the Lebanese civil war.    Hizballah militants seized six Lebanese men and a retired  Syrian soldier from the Ba'labakk region Wednesday but freed  them the next morning after the Syrian military command in the  al-Biqa' threatened to arrest Hizballah militants.    The seven were abducted after some of them were seen taking  photographs outside the home of the former Hizballah secretary  general al-Shaykh Subhi al-Tufayli.    The Iranian-backed guerrillas have been on alert since June  2  when Israeli warplanes killed 32 guerrilla trainees on a base  near Ba'labakk.</p>

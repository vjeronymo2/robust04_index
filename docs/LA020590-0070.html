			<p><P> February 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOXING;  </P> <P> FOREMAN-TYSON BOUT FACING BIG HURDLES  </P> <P> Maybe if Jim Jeffries hadn't tried that ill-advised 1910 comeback at 35,  against Jack Johnson, none of this would have happened.  </P> <P> In the ensuing 80 years, most of the heavyweight champions -- George Foreman  the most recent -- either fought too long or looked foolish in pipe-dream  comebacks. Jeffries, the Los Angeles heavyweight champion in 1899-1905, was  talked out of a five-year retirement by racists who insisted he knock the black  champion, Jack Johnson, off his perch.  </P> <P> Jeffries, made a 10-6 favorite by gamblers, was beaten savagely by Johnson, who  himself remained too long in the spotlight. At 37, he lost his title to Jess  Willard in 1915.  </P> <P> Jack Dempsey was inactive for 27 months in the 1920s, then was beaten  decisively twice by Gene Tunney. Joe Louis, Max Schmeling, Floyd Patterson,  Sonny Liston, Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier all fought years past their prime,  which brings us to Foreman.  </P> <P> Foreman, because he starched an over-the-hill heavyweight who wasn't much in  his prime, Gerry Cooney, is being showered with money offers. Word is that  Steve Wynn, who recently gave the world Sugar Ray Leonard-Roberto Duran at his  Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas, wanted Foreman to sign a three-fight deal that would  include a Mike Tyson fight as the grand finale. Foreman turned him down, it's  said.  </P> <P> A Foreman-Tyson fight is based on an assumption bigger than Foreman's waistline  -- that he can first defeat a top-10-ranked opponent, a species Foreman has  carefully avoided in his 20-bout comeback.  </P> <P> Wynn got Foreman on the phone after failing to bring middleweights Michael Nunn  and Tommy Hearns together.  </P> <P> Another possible roadblock to a Las Vegas Tyson-Foreman fight is that Donald  Trump secured first-refusal rights to Tyson-Foreman when he bought the June 18  Tyson-Evander Holyfield showdown for $12 million.  </P> <P> If Foreman beats Jose Ribalta, Trevor Berbick or another top-10 boxer, then the  prospect of Tyson-Foreman becomes only slightly less ludicrous than it is now.  Until then, George Foreman remains as ill-equipped to fight Mike Tyson as he  was when he began his comeback in 1987 after a 10-year retirement.  </P> <P> And speaking of over-the-hill heavyweights, are you ready for Larry  Holmes-Michael Spinks III? Santa Monica promoter Harold Smith wants to match  the two ex-champions -- both of whom were flattened by Tyson -- in Indonesia.  </P> <P> Smith talked to Holmes about such a matchup not long ago in Easton, Pa., and a  $3-million purse for Holmes was discussed.  </P> <P> "They talked, and Larry told Harold: 'Show me the money, Harold, then we'll  talk,' " said Richie Giachetti, one-time Holmes trainer.  </P> <P> And that, boxing fans, remains the name of the game. Money, $65,000 to be  exact, brought Jim Jeffries back, and it's what brought Foreman back. Foreman  would make millions in a Tyson fight, but the outcome would be the same as  Jeffries-Johnson, with a young champion looking down on a beaten, old champion.  </P> <P> Boxing Notes  </P> <P> According to Boxing Update newsletter, Roberto Duran aided U.S. troops during  the Panama invasion. Duran is said to have encouraged Panamanians not to resist  the Americans and also to have "loaned" one of his apartments to U.S. troops,  who used it to watch the Papal Embassy, where Manuel Noriega took refuge.  </P> <P> Jimmy Lennon Jr., will be the ring announcer for the Mike Tyson-Buster Douglas  fight in Tokyo next Saturday. Lennon, 31, is in his eighth year of introducing  fighters. His father, now retired, did the same for decades, mostly at the  Olympic Auditorium. . . . Richie Giachetti, once Larry Holmes' trainer, on  Douglas: "He's got a better shot than (Tony) Tubbs. But if he gets whacked,  he's gone." . . . A federal judge in New York ruled Wednesday that all foreign  TV-rights money from the Tyson-Douglas bout be paid into a court fund and not  to Tyson's estranged manager, Bill Cayton. A spokesman for Don King, Tyson's  promoter, claimed that Cayton has withheld as much as $500,000 in foreign TV  money from Tyson. King, meanwhile, has been sued for $8 million by promoter  Murad Muhammad after the Tyson-Razor Ruddock bout at Edmonton, Canada, in  November was "postponed" and then not rescheduled when Tyson became ill.  </P> <P> Caesars Palace and promoter Bob Arum lost the Tommy Hearns-Michael Olijade  middleweight fight they had tentatively set for April 26. That one will now  open the new Taj Mahal Hotel in Atlantic City, N.J., on Showtime April 28.  Arum, meanwhile, says George Foreman will "definitely" fight on an Arum show in  April in Las Vegas, against an opponent to be named. As for the theory that  Tyson-Foreman, should it occur at all, would wind up in Japan, Arum said:  "George would resist that very strongly. He's a real patriot." On the same  theme, Foreman told The Times a year ago: "Do we have to let the Japanese have  everything?  </P> <P> It's said that Steve Wynn offered Julio Cesar Chavez $4 million to fight Macho  Camacho in Las Vegas. Camacho retained his World Boxing Organization junior  welterweight title with a 12-round decision over Vinny Pazienza Saturday night.  . . . Paul Banke, one-time Azusa amateur whiz, will get a second try at Daniel  Zaragoza, the World Boxing Council super-bantamweight champion, in mid-March at  the Forum. In June, Banke lost a unanimous decision to Zaragoza in his first  title try. . . . March 14 is the 10th anniversary of the plane crash in Poland  that killed 22 members of a U.S. amateur boxing delegation, including 14  boxers.  </P> <P> Paul Gonzales was to have met the winner of the recent WBC super-flyweight  title fight in Seoul between Nana Konadu and Moon-Sung Kil, but he has been put  on hold. In a controversial finish, the bout was stopped in the ninth round  because of Kil's cuts, but Kil, not Konadu, was declared the  "technical-decision" winner because he was ahead on all scorecards. If you find  that hard to believe, you can imagine how Konadu and his corner reacted.  Japanese reporter Joe Koizumi wrote afterward that the stoppage alone mystified  nearly everyone, since Kil's cuts didn't seem all that bad. Whatever, WBC chief  Jose Sulaiman, who was present, ordered a rematch as soon as possible. So, for  Gonzales, who was promised the winner at the Forum, the wait goes on. In fact,  he may give up on the super-fly title idea altogether and instead challenge WBC  bantamweight champion Raul Perez.  </P> <P> Mark Breland will defend his World Boxing Assn. welterweight title in London  March 3 against Lloyd Honeyghan. . . . Unbeaten Virgil Hill will defend his WBA  light-heavyweight title for the eighth time Feb. 25 in his hometown, Bismarck,  N.D., against David Vedder. A victory by Hill would set up a possible HBO  light-heavyweight unification tournament.  </P> <P> Lennox Lewis, the 1988 Olympic super-heavyweight gold medalist, improved to 7-0  as a pro with a second-round KO of Noel Quarless Wednesday in London. He will  next meet African champion Proud Kilimanjaro. . . . Henry Woods, top  welterweight of the 1930s, died in Yakima, Wash., Wednesday. Woods, 75, was  once the California lightweight champion and lost a 1935 decision to Barney  Ross in a world title bout. . . . Olympian lightweight Todd Foster of Great  Falls, Mont., 10-0 as a pro, may fight on an NBC card soon and then be signed  afterward to a multifight package by the network.  </P> <P> Mando Ramos celebrates the 21st anniversary of his winning the world  lightweight title from Teo Cruz at 20 on Feb. 18 at Local 9 Shipbuilders Hall  in Wilmington. An amateur boxing show, dinner and film highlights of Ramos'  boxing career are scheduled. Tickets are $25, with proceeds going to Boxing  Against Alcohol and Drugs.

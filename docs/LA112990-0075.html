			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXPRESS LINE;  </P> <P> FOR DESSERT: A REALLY FAST SORBET  </P> <P> A FISH STORY  </P> <P> Tomato Trout Bake  </P> <P> Pasta or rice bed  </P> <P> Steamed or sauteed green beans  </P> <P> Persimmon sorbet  </P> <P> Nothing fishy about this rainbow trout. It's simple, healthful and quick.  Oven-steamed in foil with flavorful vegetables, the fish is not masked with any  complicated sauce.  </P> <P> The secret to tender, moist trout is to avoid overcooking. The fish is done  when it flakes easily with a fork. (Note: If you buy the fish frozen, check the  expiration date on the package; also, make sure there are no holes in it, or  the fish may have suffered dehydration.)  </P> <P> Green beans team nicely with our catch of the day; saute them in garlic butter  and splash a little balsamic vinegar at the end. A no-fuss sweet ending to the  meal is instant persimmon sorbet: a frozen whole persimmon. It's delicious, but  make sure the fruit is ripe and juicy.  </P> <P> Try this Tomato Trout Bake. Its healthful goodness will set you up for the  forthcoming indulgences of holiday foods.  </P> <P> Staples  </P> <P> Salt  </P> <P> Pepper  </P> <P> Butter  </P> <P> 1 lemon  </P> <P> Shopping  </P> <P> 1 medium tomato  </P> <P> 1 bunch green onions  </P> <P> 1 small ginger root  </P> <P> 4 to 6 fresh shiitake or other mushrooms  </P> <P> 2 small or 1 large rainbow trout, preferably boneless  </P> <P> 1.

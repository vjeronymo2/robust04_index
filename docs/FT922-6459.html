			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Buy and sell on the Bulletin Board - Diary of a Private Investor WHAT DO the Chepstow Racecourse Company, Hartlepool's Water Company, Hidong Estate, Inch Kenneth Kajang Rubber, Padang Senang Holdings and Stavert Zigomala all have in common - apart from me not having shares in any of them? The answer is that all are included in the stock exchange's new Bulletin Board service. Last September, I wrote about my difficulties in trying to buy and sell shares in a number of companies where turnover was not high, and I suggested setting up a service where private investors could advertise their requirements. This, I felt, would help to improve turnover in the shares of many companies where dealings were few and far between and/or happened only in very small parcels. Bulletin Board was introduced on April 27 and it goes a long way towards meeting my proposal. Around 120 UK-listed and USM company securities are included in the service, which aims to 'provide a centrally-focused market creating a more efficient, flexible and low-cost environment in which to trade. It will also provide for greater market visibility for those securities for which no continuous two-way prices on SEAQ (stock exchange automated quotation system) exist.' The exchange's Topic information system, used by all UK brokers, now has a special Bulletin Board section on which member firms can display their purchase or sale requirements for shares in the companies involved. For example, suppose a private investor, while reassessing his portfolio, finds a share certificate for a company he had forgotten about, or one in which shares had been traded in comparatively small numbers only. He can now ask his broker to see if the company is featured on the Bulletin Board. If it is, the Topic screen pages will list various details, such as its approximate free-market capitalisation as a percentage of the shares issued; the expected dates of announcements of final and interim results; the after-tax profits; and the volume of shares traded in the previous 12 months. The screen pages will also display details of the past 10 trades executed in that stock - including the date, price and quantity for each of them - and it will identify the member firms that were a party to the trades. Armed with this information, the investor and his broker can make a decision more easily about selling an existing holding or increasing it. Either way, the broker can enter onto the screen either a firm or an indicative order, or both. To ensure the system works fairly and efficiently, the stock exchange has appointed a controller to the Bulletin Board, and all trades using it must be reported to the controller within three minutes of trading. There are many other rules and regulations; to make sure brokers are aware of them, the exchange has issued a 16-page guide for users. As a private investor, I have for years included holdings in small companies as a significant part of my share portfolio. The risks are greater but so, too, can be the rewards. Small companies are, for example, much more likely to double profits in a year than others the size of, say, GEC. The Bulletin Board service is still in its infancy but trade is encouraging. In its first week, 86 securities were advertised, with 78 firm orders and 29 indicative orders. These resulted in 35 actual trades taking place, with a total value of Pounds 389,302. For the period May 11-15, there were again 86 securities advertised, but there were 45 trades with a total value of Pounds 654,397. It is important to remember that caution is required: not all the companies included on the Bulletin Board have shares worth buying. But the stock exchange is to be congratulated on trying to open up the market and, as the service becomes more widely known and used, there should be increased benefits to investors.</p>

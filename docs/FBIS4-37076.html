			<p>BFN     [Text] Pakistan has deeply regretted the kidnapping of two  British nationals from occupied Kashmir and has called for their  immediate and unconditional release. A Foreign Office spokesman  briefing newsmen in Islamabad said Pakistan has always condemned  the acts of terrorism regardless of their motivation. He said  consistent with our policy, the Government of Pakistan strongly  urges that the British nationals should be released forthwith  without any conditions. The spokesman also urged India to end  its repression of Kashmiri people and called for the release of  detained Kashmiri leaders, freedom fighters and journalists for  expressing true aspirations of the people of Jammu and Kashmir.  The British nationals Kim Housego and David Mackie were  kidnapped from the held-Kashmir on Tuesday by a group which has  demanded release three of its comrades in exchange.    Replying to a question about the involvement of Pakistanis  or  members of some Pakistan-based organizations in the incident,  the spokesman said we have no information which would  corroborate or confirm this report. He said there are also  rumors in New Delhi that the incident has, in fact, been  organized by the Government of India or some of its agencies.    Replying to another question regarding the test of medium  range surface-to-surface Prithvi missile by India, the spokesman  said it is a clear rebuff of U.S. position and approaches which  it had been trying to promote in South Asia. He said, however,  U.S. reaction to Prithvi missile has been tepid. He said the  United States had approached Pakistan and India last year  offering a proposal of South Asia missile nonproliferation  regime. He said Pakistan had responded positively to this  proposal and suggested the concept of zero missile zone in South  Asia. However, Indian reaction was inconclusive. The spokesman  said we believe in equity and nondiscrimination on nuclear  nonproliferation in South Asia and will not accept any  unilateral approach that threatens the security of Pakistan.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Here is an additional report on the Pailin  battlefield from 4 to 5 April:    1. On 4 April, the invading forces sent 400 troops and some  tanks to rescue 600 of their colleagues trapped in the western  part of Pailin. We attacked them continuously -- shooting,  detonating mines, and lobbing hand grenades at them along the  trails in the thick bamboo forests. We killed 36 of them,  including a general commander, and wounded some others. We  destroyed two trucks. The survivors who fled through the bamboo  forests were bruised by the bamboo thorns; their faces and  bodies were bruised and their clothes were torn. Some lost  their way and are still fumbling their way out of the forests.  Others were killed or wounded by stepping on land mines planted  in the bamboo forests by the Vietnamese.    2. On 5 April, the invading forces mobilized troops to blaze  a trail from Boeng Pra-lit to O Rum-el through the bamboo  forests. We ambushed them there. We ambushed them 12 times  along an 8 km stretch. We killed 19 of them, wounded some  others, and destroyed two trucks. Some retreated along the  trail and some fled in disarray into the bamboo forests. No one  knows how many were killed or wounded or how many were bruised  by the bamboo thorns.    The fighting on 4 and 5 April took place mostly on small  trails inside thick bamboo forests within the perimeter and in  the western part of Pailin.    3. On 4 April, we completely swept the invading forces from  Bos S'am, north of Pailin. We killed nine of them and wounded  16 others. The survivors fled in great panic into the forests.    4. On 4 and 5 April, we surrounded and attacked Sala Krau.  The invading forces were in great panic. We killed 27 of them  and wounded some others. The survivors fled in disarray into  the forests.    (Lay Veareak), commander of the 12th Division in charge of  Sala Krau, whose field radio code name is Satan, fled north  toward Kon Damrei along with 100 soldiers. He stripped off his  uniform to hide his identity as a general. It is generally  known that (Lay Veareak) has always been a bandit chieftain  operating on the border in the Poipet-Sisophon zone.    5. Also on 4 April, we opened fire on a car -- a French  Renault -- and set it ablaze near Boeng Pra-lit.    6. On the morning of 5 April, one of the invading forces'  tanks ran over a land mine and broke down near Pang Roloem on  Route 10.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Basil al-Asad's death was not only a sad occasion at  which the Lebanese and Syrians could show their love for the  unofficial successor of President Hafiz al-Asad, it was also an  occasion to mend Syria's strained relations with some Arab  states. The PLO exploited Basil's death and quickly sent a  high-level delegation, led by Faruq Qaddumi, also known as  Abu-al-Lutf, to clear the air which has been heavily clouded by  sharp differences following the announcement of the results of  the secret Oslo talks and tha Declaration of Principles between  Israel and the PLO. 'Arafat was not satisfied with this step.  He personally participated in offering condolences to President  al-Asad to break the ice between the two sides, which has cast a  heavy shadow on Syrian-PLO relations.    Coincidence has also served Syrian-Iraqi ties -- still the  number one example of hostile relations between Arab regimes.  Basil al-Asad's death coincided with the convening of a  conference for Arab agriculture ministers in Damascus. Iraq was  one of the countries that took part in the conference.  Observers said Iraq's attendance of the conference, despite the  fact that it held in Damascus, was a positive sign of Iraq's  desire to improve relations with Syria.    An Arab diplomatic source in Amman said: Apparently, Iraq's  response to the conference's invitation in Damascus reflects  positive signs between the two countries that have been  increasing secretly over the past months.    The diplomat told SHIHAN that Iraqi Agriculture Minister  Bashir 'Alwan Hammadi offered condolences to President al-Asad  on behalf of Iraqi President Saddam Husayn. This shows  relations between the two sides are developing to some extent.    The diplomat pointed out that the Iraqi minister made  political contacts with several Syrian officials in Damascus.  Other Arab agriculture ministers noticed that Minister 'Alwan  missed several conference sessions, and that some Syrian Foreign  Ministry officials were seen accompanying him. This means the  Iraqi minister was holding talks with Syrian officials regarding  developing relations between the two countries.    SHIHAN has learned that Damascus turned down a draft  resolution proposed by Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab  Emirates, and Bahrain calling for an Arab protocol to exchange  agricultural products between Arab states, excluding Iraq, in  accordance with Security Council resolutions.    Sources said Syrian Agriculture Minister As'ad Mustafa  refused even to include the draft on the agenda, telling Gulf  agriculture ministers that the Arab Agriculture Organization is  an Arab, and not international, organization and has nothing to  do with commitment to Security Council resolutions.    This Syrian position reflects progress toward improving  relations with Iraq, which is being done quietly, slowly, and  away from media clamor.</p>

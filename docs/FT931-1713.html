			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Prudential doubles to Pounds 406m - Mercantile &amp; General non-life loss grows from Pounds 60m to Pounds 143m PRUDENTIAL CORPORATION, the financial services and life insurance company, shrugged off heavy losses at its reinsurance subsidiary, Mercantile &amp; General, to more than double 1992 pre-tax profits to Pounds 406m, compared with Pounds 182m. Earnings per share were 15p (4.7p). The final dividend is raised to 7.8p, lifting the total from 11p to 11.9p. The company also announced that - as expected - reversionary and terminal bonus rates are to be cut this year as a result of lower levels of anticipated investment returns. Profits on life business increased to Pounds 444m (Pounds 385m), but were partly offset by losses on the general insurance business of Pounds 110m (Pounds 58m) and further losses on discontinued lines of general business of Pounds 11m (Pounds 91m). Shareholders' other income amounted to Pounds 134m (Pounds 86m). Interest payable fell to Pounds 51m (Pounds 55m). The accounts have been prepared in accordance with FRS 3 accounting principles. Pre-tax profits from home and motor insurance - the only significant general insurance business owned by the group - grew to Pounds 33m (Pounds 2m), reflecting milder weather, premium increases and a reduced incidence of claims. However, losses from Mercantile's non-life operations were Pounds 143m (Pounds 60m), with an underwriting loss of Pounds 187m, partially offset by an investment return of Pounds 44m. Mr Mick Newmarch, group chief executive, described the performance as 'dire'. Although Mercantile appointed new management last year, it was hard hit in 1992 by two North American hurricanes which produced losses of Pounds 56m. The group has been forced to increase its reserves against losses from catastrophe reinsurance underwritten between 1988 and 1990. Losses from marine London market excess business amounted to Pounds 58m. Mercantile's non-life exposure has already been sharply curtailed. Mr Newmarch said the group was 'determined not to allow Mercantile's general business to detract from its life operation.' By contrast profits from life business rose by 15 per cent to Pounds 444m, with worldwide premiums up by 23 per cent to Pounds 7.6bn. UK life profits rose to Pounds 276m. See Lex</p>

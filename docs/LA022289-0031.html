			<p><P> February 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Jesse Jackson made an appeal Monday for the "earliest possible" parole of soul  singer James Brown, saying Brown had been a model prisoner and an inspiration  to others. Jackson, who met with Brown for more than 90 minutes at the State  Park Correctional Institute near Columbia, S.C., told USA Today that Brown's  punishment seemed excessive, but added, "It's not the time to make a judgment  on the judge, it's a time to appeal for mercy." Brown is entering his third  month in prison for a six-year sentence stemming from a two-state, high-speed  police chase last September. Shauna Snow  </P></p>

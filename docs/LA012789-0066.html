			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEAMSTER DEAL: POOR SOLUTION  </P> <P> The formula that the Justice Department has proposed for settling its ambitious  racketeering lawsuit against the Teamsters Union is inadequate. In its attempt  to rid the nation's largest union of corruption without a costly and  time-consuming trial, the Justice Department is both going too far and not far  enough. The likely result is that the Teamsters, whose documented ties to  organized crime have made it practically a subsidiary of La Cosa Nostra, will  once again elude real reform.  </P> <P> In its original complaint last June the Justice Department sought to oust the  Teamsters' entire governing board and to place the union under court  trusteeship until free elections could be held. The suit, based on the  Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), was a last-gasp  effort to achieve in civil court what the Justice Department had failed to  achieve by prosecuting dozens of Teamster leaders and their allies in the mob.  But the spectacle of the federal government's moving to take over an entire  union, even one as tainted as the Teamsters, alarmed other labor leaders and  inspired demands from 250 members of Congress that the Justice Department  abandon its high-handed campaign.  </P> <P> Now the prosecutors are backing off. As Times staff writer Robert L. Jackson  has reported, the Justice Department has indicated that it will settle for the  resignations of about half a dozen members of the 18-man board and a pledge  from the survivors to institute internal reforms, including a secret-ballot  election of the union's president. But that formula isn't much of a solution.  </P> <P> For the government to force out members of a union board, chosen under  procedures previously sanctioned by the government, sets an antidemocratic  precedent. And it might mean little change in the union's character, because  the bylaws permit Teamster President William J. McCarthy to appoint like-minded  replacements. McCarthy has denied having personal ties to the New England Mafia  -- as his predecessor, the late Jackie Presser, once told the FBI -- but at the  very least he has been blind to the Mafia's penetration of the union. McCarthy  recently admitted that he had never even discussed with other Teamster  officials the charge of mob influence by the President's Commission on  Organized Crime. Where has he been? In a hermetically sealed room?  </P> <P> The Justice Department's willingness to allow the next Teamster president to be  elected by a secret ballot of union convention delegates is also troubling.  Those delegates are often appointed, not elected by the rank-and-file, and  letting them vote in secret would make them even less accountable to the  membership. The most democratic way to choose a Teamster president would be  through a one-man, one-vote election of the entire membership. That is the  course urged by Teamsters for a Democratic Union, the 8,000-member organization  that has long been a thorn in the Teamsters' side. Some experts contend that  the current leadership is so entrenched that a challenger could never win a  plebiscite, but that has not been the case with the United Mine Workers, which  overcame a long history of corruption and violence through popular elections.  Many individual Teamsters hate the idea that their union is synonymous with the  mob; they should be given a chance to vote their corrupt bosses out of office.  </P></p>

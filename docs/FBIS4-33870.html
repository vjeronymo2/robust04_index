			<p>BFN     [Text] Barbados' sugar quota on the European market could  be in jeopardy next year. Ann Drelo says this has nothing to do  with management or a bad harvest. It does, however, have to do  with the weather:    [Begin recording] [Drelo] The drought and brush fires have  combined to put the island's number two industry in financial  trouble. Agricultural officials point out that several acres of  young cane plants have been destroyed. The damage is so severe  that hopes of meeting the 54,000-tonne EC quota appear remote at  this point. Already the organization responsible for managing  the sugar industry -- the Barbados Agricultural Management  Company [BAMC] -- is compiling data on the drought and the  fires. It is hoping to use this data to show that any  shortfalls are the result of an act of God.    [Unidentified speaker] I've been told by the management, the  top management in BAMC, that they are going ahead with informing  the European Union well ahead of next year's crop of the  problems we've had with the drought to make absolutely sure that  we are not unprepared when it comes to not being able to fill  our quota, because this is a really serious issue. If we lose  any of our 50,000-tonne quota and we make it even less, we are  even less likely to survive in the future. So, it is absolutely  important, it is absolutely essential, that we keep our quota  with the European Union.    [Drelo] Chairman of the BAMC, Dr. Atley Bradford, says he is  looking carefully at the situation and a request for a reprieve  could go off to the EC in December. He says this would give  them enough time to see if the crop has recovered. However, he  says even if the rain falls heavily now, next year's crop won't  reach the output of this year's. Dr. Bradford says the industry  would not make a profit from this year's crop and the loss of  the EC quota or a reprieve would spell doom for the industry.  [end recording]</p>

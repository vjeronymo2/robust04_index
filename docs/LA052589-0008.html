			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Two white South Africans were hanged for murder, but lawyers won a last-minute  stay of execution for two black political activists. A spokesman for the South  African group Lawyers for Human Rights said Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee  issued the stays to allow lawyers to present new evidence. The two black men  were convicted of the "necklace" killing -- in which a gasoline-filled tire is  placed around the victim's neck and set afire -- of a black police officer. The  two white men who were hanged were convicted in separate cases of murder and  robbery.  </P></p>

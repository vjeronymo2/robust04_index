			<p>BFN     [Text] Santo Domingo, 2 May (DPA) -- The violent electoral  campaign in the Dominican Republic has claimed two more victims,  who were shot dead yesterday during an incident in which 17 more  persons were wounded. Those who died were followers of the  Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD) who were participating in a  large caravan that was attacked by unidentified assailants.    The dead individuals are Dr. Edgard de la Rosa, 29, and  Nelson Nunez, 44. It was reported that Nunez was the bodyguard  of Joaquin Sanchez, who is the PRD candidate for mayor of La  Vega.    The PRD accused the followers of President Joaquin Balaguer  and of the ruling Social Christian Reformist Party (PRSC) of  having opened fire on the caravan with heavy-caliber weapons.  Spokesmen for the opposition party said that since the campaign  began last 16 March, seven of their followers have been murdered  in various places and over 100 have been injured.    Today, PRD presidential candidate Jose Francisco Pena Gomez  urged the PRSC and President Balaguer to sign a pact to halt  violence and "prevent further bloodshed after the 16 May  elections." Pena Gomez also proposed that none of the parties  that will participate in the elections declare victory before  the Central Electoral Board (JCE) makes the official  announcement. The PRD also asked the Catholic Church to mediate  so that this pact be signed and "no Dominican fall victim to  political violence."    On 24 April, a 23-year-old woman was shot twice in the head  and killed when a PRD caravan was attacked in one sector of  Santo Domingo. Yesterday's incident occurred after the  conclusion of a PRD regional meeting when a large number of  followers were returning to La Vega. The shots were apparently  made with an automatic weapon. The wounded were taken to  hospitals in La Vega and Santiago. La Vega is some 160 km north  of Santo Domingo.</p>

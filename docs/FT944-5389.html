			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / How to Spend It: Strong scents of occasion - Lucia van der Post carries a flame for a sweet-smelling home I first became interested in sweet smells for the house when my son kept hamsters, and even though the creatures were banished to the cellar (animal rights activists can relax, these were the days when he was small and I knew no better), an aroma began to waft around the house that was, shall we say. . . musty. Most of us have less urgent reasons for perfuming the house. We simply find a sweet-smelling home as essential to our sense of well-being as comfortable sofas and fresh coffee. And candles are a quick and cheap way of adding magic to any room. The success of Wax Lyrical, a small niche-chain of 21 shops selling nothing but candles, is proof that once people have discovered the charm of candles, they become addicted. Marjorie Bannister and Mark Chessel started the business on a hunch. While on a trip to Iceland, they were enchanted by the way candles were used in Icelandic homes and became convinced that the British would take to using them if only they were made more accessible. Their initial research revealed that 95 per cent of British people only ever used candles at Christmas. Since Bannister and Chessel opened their first specialist candle-only shop in Richmond, the market in the UK has grown by leaps and bounds. Some of the cheapest and most seductive scents are aromatherapy candles, which are infused with essential oils. These come in little stone pots, and cost Pounds 4.95, the most popular scents being sandalwood and ylang-ylang. Minimalists who would never use anything but plain cream will find classic ivory church candles in all sizes and prices. For more baroque tastes, there is an opulent Russian range. Matt-gold, rose-shaped candles floating over a bed of glass nuggets, gold orbs, or taper candles with rich fluted glass candle-holders and crystal grapes would cater perfectly for romantics. Anybody who remembers dear old Price's candles will be amazed at what the company is up to now - wax-filled tin buckets and mugs, diamond tea-lights, hanging lanterns, as well as a wide range of candles scented with citronella essence, which will not only suffuse the house with a tangy, lemony scent but will also keep midges away. And for the purists, the firm still sells its classic range. Annick Goutal (stocked by Harrods, Selfridges, Harvey Nichols, The Conran Shop and Liberty as well as selected out-of-London shops) offers natural stones impregnated with essences. These sit on a diffuser placed over a light bulb and give off a subtle but delicious scent. They cost Pounds 39.50 and the scents are Fleur Blanche, Eau d'Hadrien, Rose Absolue, Passion and Sables. A specialist shop for all things fragrant is L'Artisan Parfumeur, 17 Cale Street, London SW3 (071-352 4196). The fragrance Ambre comes as a burning oil costing Pounds 21.95 for an applicator top and two pressed ceramic rings. It also comes as a room spray at Pounds 18.95, and for musty cars there is L'Eau de l'Auto Ambre at Pounds 16.50. However, most luxurious of all are the terracotta pomanders, filled with ambergris, which provide a wonderful perfume in a wardrobe or chest of drawers. Tisserand is another name to look out for. It specialises in essential oils and has a vast range of candles scented with everything from jasmine to orange-blossom or sandalwood. For occasions when use of a flame would be dangerous, it stocks two electric devices. The first, the Aromastone (Pounds 23.90), comes in a little round pot that gives off the scent of sandalwood, frankincense and other fragrances from a range. The second, the Aromastream, which comes in a little white unit (Pounds 23.90), looks boring but it dispenses cooler fragrances, such as citrus. My own personal preferences run to house-scents that veer towards the subtle and understated and it is hard to beat the classics such as Rigaud's Cypres, which costs Pounds 49.95 at The Conran Shop, and Czech &amp; Speake's plain frosted-glass containers filled with candles perfumed with frankincense and myrrh, rose and mimosa and costing Pounds 25 each. Anybody who has ever been to Florence may have paid a visit to the Farmacia Santa Maria Novella, which claims to be the oldest pharmacy in the world. A branch has now opened at 117 Walton Street, selling the same delectably perfumed lotions and potions. In particular, look out for Armeneia paper, which is burnt to scent the air, perfumed drawer-lining paper and a refreshing mint soap that repels insects. Another little shop, La Bougie, has been open only two months at 5 Montpelier Street, Knightsbridge, London SW7 and specialises in nothing but candles and candle appurtenances. It is modelled on the Paris shop of the same name and is the place to look for strong and dramatic candelabra (Pounds 80), wrought-iron candle-stands for floating candles (Pounds 11.80), or a wrought-iron stand over 2ft high with a glass bowl for floating candles (Pounds 95). And if by now you are tired of candles, you can restore your flagging spirits with a glass of champagne and some seafood in the champagne and oyster bar in the basement.</p>

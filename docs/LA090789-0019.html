			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCHOOL LUNCHES COME UNDER FIRE;  </P> <P> STATE LEGISLATION AIMED AT REDUCING FAT AND CHOLESTEROL CONTENT IN MEALS  </P> <P> State legislators have taken aim at the fat and cholesterol content of school  lunches with a bill designed to reduce the potentially harmful compounds in  meals served to California students.  </P> <P> Legislation calling for the new dietary guidelines for school food service  programs last week passed the state Senate by a 32-0 vote. A slightly different  version was approved earlier by the Assembly. The bills will now be reconciled  by the Legislature before being sent to Gov. George Deukmejian for  consideration. If enacted, the measure would be the first of its kind in the  nation.  </P> <P> The bill, sponsored by Assemblywoman Jackie Speier (D-S. San Francisco),  requires that the state's Department of Education establish maximum intakes of  compounds such as saturated fat and cholesterol for school lunches.  </P> <P> No more than 30% of the total caloric intake of school-age children should be  from fat, according to several federal advisory panels such as the National  Research Council.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Elevated Cholesterol Levels  </P> <P> The state's new program, which would become effective Jan. 1, was prompted by  Speier's concern over a recent study that indicated as many as 37% of those  California fourth-graders tested had elevated blood cholesterol levels.  </P> <P> "In March, during National Nutrition Month, I went to a local grammar school in  my district to have lunch with the children. And we dined on Tater Tots and  corn dogs. They're foods loaded with fat and cholesterol," she said. "If we  want to raise healthy kids to healthy adults, then we need to become more  aggressive in preparing meals in school that are healthful."  </P> <P> Speier said that recent research indicates that poor eating habits developed by  children often carry over into adulthood. A lifelong high-fat diet could be  especially troublesome because it is considered a risk factor for heart  disease. Elevated cholesterol levels have also been linked to increased  incidence of atherosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries.  </P> <P> Nutritional deficiencies in the school lunch program are not restricted to  California. A report issued last week by a Washington-based consumer group was  highly critical of the nutritional content of meals being served to the  nation's school children.  </P> <P> Public Voice for Food &amp; Health Policy randomly surveyed, via  questionnaires, school food service professionals nationwide in order to assess  attitudes about the fat content of meals served to students. The vast majority  of those queried, or 80%, said that fat content needs to be reduced in the  children's meals.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Critical Dietary Change'  </P> <P> "We chose this focus because of the strong consensus among health professionals  that intake of fat is the single most critical dietary change needed by  individuals two years of age and older," said Ellen Haas, Public Voice  Executive Director. "In recent months we have seen important documentation of  this in reports from the surgeon general, the National Academy of Sciences and  a number of newly reported scientific studies."  </P> <P> Many of those who responded to the Public Voice questionnaires laid the blame  for the fat problem, in particular, with the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  </P> <P> The agency spends more than $4 billion to subsidize school meals throughout the  country. More than 24 million children at 91,000 schools receive some form of  federal assistance.  </P> <P> Yet, much of this aid comes in the form of surplus agricultural commodities  such as ground meats, butter, cheese and eggs, each of which is considered high  in fat or cholesterol. Schools, particularly those in middle- to low-income  areas, depend on these free commodities in order to operate their feeding  programs.  </P> <P> "Many of the products that come to the schools (from USDA) are not of interest  to the student population," said Speier.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Varying School Lunches  </P> <P> A USDA spokesman said the agency has made several efforts to vary the foods  served in the school lunch program and also lower the fat, salt and sugar  content of the meals.  </P> <P> For instance, only lean ground beef, with a 22% fat level, can be used in the  program, said Gene Vincent, a USDA public affairs officer.  </P> <P> The agency has also attempted to incorporate more chicken, turkey and fish into  the feeding program, he said.  </P> <P> The USDA has not set maximum fat levels for the diets of children because there  is still some scientific dispute over research on the subject.  </P> <P> "There is no scientific consensus on appropriate levels of fat in children's  diets, said Scott Dunn, acting administrator for the USDA's Food and Nutrition  Service. "Moreover, it is important to remember that no matter what level is  deemed appropriate, that level must be applied to a person's entire diet, not  to a single food or a single meal. USDA cannot at this time support setting  quantitative fat standards or recommended frequency of serving certain foods."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Survey Findings  </P> <P> Public Voice, in its 35-page report on the survey, made several recommendations  to the USDA in order to improve the school lunch program. These include:  </P> <P>  -- Have the agency set a maximum level of fat in school lunches at 30% of  total calories.  </P> <P>  -- Educate school food professionals about how to reduce dietary fat in meals.  </P> <P>  -- Make lower-fat commodities from government surplus programs available to  schools.  </P> <P>  -- Increase spending on nutrition education in the classroom. Such funding has  been reduced or eliminated in previous years.  </P> <P> The group also urged the food industry to work in conjunction with the federal  government and local school officials to develop nutritious lunch items that  would be popular with children.  </P></p>

			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Rotating environment planned for EC agency THE European Commission has lost patience with French obstructionism over where to site the European Environment Agency. The Community decided to set up the agency 20 months ago, but France has refused to agree on its headquarters until Strasbourg is confirmed as the permanent home of the European Parliament. Senior officials say Brussels is expected tomorrow to announce a provisional plan designed both to get the agency up and running, and force member states to think seriously about a permanent home for what is seen as a vital tool in EC environmental policy. The Commission will suggest that board meetings of the agency rotate throughout the Twelve along with each six-monthly presidency, but that agency staff and computer services should be sited in Brussels, officials said. They acknowledged there was resistance both in the Commission and among member states to create more 'transient' institutions like the European Parliament itself. The latter has its plenary sessions in Strasbourg, its committee meetings in Brussels and staff in Luxembourg, under a 10-year-old provisional compromise to constrain competing claims to host it. But after the last four summits of EC heads of government ducked the issue, the Commission believes further procrastination would badly damage Community credibility in environmental politics, especially in the run-up to the June 'earth summit' on global warming in Rio de Janeiro. Brussels officials hope nevertheless any decision from the Twelve to rotate the agency will be a provisional solution. Competition to host EC institutions will increase as a result of the programme agreed at last December's Maastricht summit to introduce economic and monetary union by 1999 at the latest.</p>

			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Cold winter and cost cuts behind advance at Calor A cold winter and cost-cutting helped Calor Group, the bottled gas supplier, increase interim pre-tax profits by 13 per cent from Pounds 27.6m to Pounds 31.1m in spite of a 3 per cent drop in turnover from Pounds 153m to Pounds 148m. Mr Hamish Macpherson, group treasurer, said the cold snap between January and March had helped to improve volumes, which rose by 6 per cent. 'People were keeping the gas fires burning a little bit longer,' he said. However, the benefits of improved volumes were offset by lower butane and propane prices. The trading climate remained difficult, Mr Macpherson said, although the decline in prices had begun to stabilise. The treasurer said Calor had maintained its more than 50 per cent share of the UK liquid petroleum gas business, despite fierce competition. Calor's profits were also helped by the continuing programme to cut costs. Since 1990, Mr Macpherson estimated the group had cut some Pounds 10m a year from on-going costs. Operating profits in the first half rose by 9 per cent to Pounds 30.3m. Profits in the core gas business increased by 6 per cent to Pounds 31.4m. The group finished the first half with net cash of Pounds 60m. Calor's strong balance sheet would allow it to seek acquisitions abroad in its main LPG business. Mr Macpherson said Calor would look for opportunities both with its 46 per cent shareholder, SHV, and independently. The LPG joint venture with SHV in Poland, Hungary and Slovakia was breaking even. Calor invested Pounds 800,000 in the business in the first half. The drinks dispensing operation - where Calor leases air separation systems to brewers and pub chains - reduced its losses from Pounds 1.6m to Pounds 1.1m. This business was expected to break even next year. The dividend is maintained at 6p. Earnings were 13 per cent higher at 11.7p (10.4p). COMMENT These results are yet again a demonstration of how value can be extracted from the LPG market - even if it is a mature one. By passing on the benefits of increased purchasing to customers, reducing costs and holding margins, Calor has built itself a net Pounds 60m cash pile. The problem now is what to do with it. There are likely to be few exciting opportunities to buy into the international LPG market, and those that are around will take some time to develop. Shareholders facing little excitement in the short-term will be wanting to see some of that cash find its way into an increased dividend. Forecasts are for just that. Profits are expected to rise to Pounds 37m this year, along with a small boost to the pay-out of 0.5p for a total of 13p. The yield of almost 6 per cent against the market's 4 per cent is Calor's biggest attraction.</p>

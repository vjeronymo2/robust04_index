			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhou Shuchun (0719 2885 2504)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 12 May (XINHUA) -- While meeting with  former U.S. Secretary of State Kissinger at the Diaoyutai state  guesthouse this afternoon, President Jiang Zemin said that  Sino-U.S. relations have never been limited to bilateral ties  but rather are closely related to the international situation.  Sino-U.S. relations should be improved, for this is required  for world peace and stability.    At the beginning of the meeting, President Jiang Zemin  extended a welcome to Kissinger for making another trip to  China. He said: Dr. Kissinger has always worked unswervingly  and vigorously to develop Sino-U.S. relations with the foresight  of a strategist and the courage of a statesman. This is  commendable.    He said: After the end of the cold war, the trend of  multipolarization in the world has been intensifying, and the  international situation as a whole is moving toward a  relaxation; economic interests are becoming the main factor  having a bearing on international relations. The universal  desire of the people of all countries is seeking a relaxation,  cooperation, and progress. However, the end of the cold war has  not brought about universal peace for the people of the world.  Turbulence and unceasing military conflicts have continued in  many regions. This situation cannot but draw the universal  concern of the people of the world. He stressed: "China and the  United States, as two powers having a considerable influence on  the world, bear an important responsibility for the future of  the world and the destiny of mankind. We should do something  for the people of the world."    After reviewing the course of the development of Sino-U.S.  relations, Jiang Zemin pointed out: Confrontation between China  and the United States will do no one any good, but the  development of cooperation between the two countries will  benefit the peoples of the two countries and the people of the  world. Although there are some disputes, some problems, and  differences between the two countries, in the final analysis,  efforts should be made to improve relations between them. This  is required for world peace and stability.    Jiang Zemin said: Practice demonstrates fully that Sino-U.S.  relations have not been merely limited to bilateral ties but are  closely related to the international situation. In the past,  Sino- U.S. relations developed more smoothly whenever both sides  were able to overcome their differences in social systems and  value concepts, and when they proceeded from their common  interests, developed mutually beneficial cooperation, and  continually expanded common points on the basis of mutual  respect, noninterference in each other's internal affairs, and  treated each other on an equal footing. However, Sino-U.S.  relations met with difficulties or setbacks or even regressed  whenever these principles were violated, differences over  ideology were stressed, the other side's interests were ignored,  views were imposed on others, or sanctions and pressure were  applied. These historical lessons are very profound.    Jiang Zemin stressed: A good opportunity has presented  itself for the development of Sino-U.S. relations. It is hoped  that both sides will grasp the opportunity, respect each other,  seek common ground while reserving differences, and work  together on the basis of the principles set out by the three  Sino-U.S. communiques, so as to enable their relations to  develop on a healthy and normal track.    Kissinger said: The maintaining of good relations between  the United States and China is very important to peace and  stability in Asia as well as in the world. He said that he has  always been against the use of the most-favored-nation trading  status as a means to exert pressure on China and that he is also  against putting pressure on China. He expressed the hope of  seeing greater improvements in U.S.-Sino relations.    According to a Chinese official, the meeting took place in a  cordial and friendly atmosphere.    Present at the meeting were Wu Yi, minister of foreign trade  and economic cooperation; Vice Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu, and  others.</p>

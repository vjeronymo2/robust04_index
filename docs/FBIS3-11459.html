The police bomb  squad verified that both cases were false alarms.    The bomb squad acted a little after 0830 today when the  police considered suspicious the presence of a Renault 18 pickup  on Libertador Avenue with a flat tire. After a thorough check  the police verified it was only a false alarm. A police  tow-truck removed the car from near the ambassador's residence.    Soon afterward, the bomb squad returned to investigate a  white Renault 12 parked on Libertador Avenue, 80 meters from the  ambassador's residence and which had also called the attention  of the police. After inspecting the car, the police verified  that this was also a false alarm.</p>

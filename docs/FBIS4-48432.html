			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] On 5 May Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance]  once again refused to ratify a scheme to assist demobilized  troops, a scheme which was approved months ago by the  Reintegration Commission, Core. Both sides and Aldo Ajello, UN  secretary general special representative in Mozambique, have  already signed the scheme.    The document has already been referred six times to the  Supervision and Control Commission [CSC] for ratification, but  Renamo refuses to sign it, citing its war crippled as the reason.    It is a document in terms of which the international  community assists in the reintegration of demobilized troops.  At the 5 May session of the CSC, Renamo specifically linked the  ratification of the document to the solution of its war crippled.    The government's position on this issue is that Renamo's  crippled will eventually have to find a solution with the  support of the international community, though the problem  should not prevent the ratification of the general scheme for  demobilized troops which has already been approved.    A Renamo source says Afonso Dhlakama's movement wants its  crippled to be covered by the country's pension scheme. The  problem is that the pension scheme operates on the basis of  deductions from the salaries of civil servants and soldiers.  That makes it impossible to apply the scheme to the crippled.    The government argues that it is necessary to discuss and  find a solution other than the pension scheme "because it  completely violates the legal standing of how a pension scheme  operates."    The government also argues that the problem of the crippled  is not included in the document dealing with assistance to  demobilized troops, which is largely financed by the  international community and was approved at a Core meeting.  Renamo, the government, and the UN Operations in Mozambique  attended the meeting and signed the document. [passage omitted]</p>

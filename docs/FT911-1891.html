			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Sponsorship of TV relay 'ludicrous' COMMERCIAL sponsorship of television footage from the Commons would be 'ludicrous' Mr Bruce Grocott, shadow deputy leader of the house said yesterday. He condemned the idea, considered by the select committee on broadcasting, as 'horrendous' envisaging the day that Hansard, the public gallery and Mr Speaker would bear company logos. Mr Grocott also called on the government to pay for dedicated, continuous coverage of parliament rather than a satellite or cable channel. Mr John MacGregor, leader of the House, confirmed that a scheme by United Artists should be pursued as the 'most thoroughly worked out and immediately practicable' plan for broadcasting proceedings.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara -- Motherland Party (ANAP) Chairman Mesut  Yilmaz and Welfare Party (RP) leader Necmettin Erbakan made a  crucial step on Wednesday [1 June] and discussed strategies for  the toppling of the coalition government led by Prime Minister  Tansu Ciller. After the meeting, Yilmaz said that he and  Erbakan had exchanged their views at a time when the government  was weak. The RP leader, however, said that they had discussed  how to eliminate the current mismanagement.    The two leaders met in Yilmaz's office in Parliament  following Erbakan's request for an appointment on Tuesday night.  The chairmen agreed to adopt a joint stance against the  coalition government's democratization package, which includes  constitutional amendments. This situation has dashed the hope of  the junior coalition partner, the Social Democrat People's Party  (SHP), which gives utmost importance to the package. Since at  least 300 votes are necessary for constitutional change, the  coalition government, which has a total of 233 votes, has  suffered a terrible blow, as it now seems unlikely that these  changes will materialize.    The fact that ANAP and the RP oppose the democratization  package, which the SHP claims is the "only reason" why it has  stayed in government, has put even the near future of the  government at stake. At present, ANAP has 100 seats and the RP  has 39 seats in Parliament.    Despite the outside support of the Nationalist Movement  Party  (MHP), the coalition parties have lost their chance to acquire  the necessary 300 votes. After his meeting with Yilmaz, Erbakan  spoke at his party's parliamentary group meeting. Noting that  although ANAP and the RP had a total of 139 votes, there were  more than 190 deputies who shared their views. "Those deputies  are ready to topple the present government. Our colleagues in  the DYP [True Path Party] and the SHP should help us in this,"  Erbakan said.    Erbakan said that the government was trying to alter  Turkey's  agenda through the democratization package that was, to all  intents and purposes, inadequate. He said that even Mumtaz  Soysal from the SHP, professor of constitutional law, had  described the package as such.    Erbakan said his belief that Turkey needed a new government  in order to overcome the existing situation had been supported  by Yilmaz.    Before his meeting with Yilmaz, Erbakan held "secret  meetings" with some ANAP deputies, including Sadi Pehlivanoglu.  The joint stance of the opposition parties and the intraparty  conflicts within the coalition parties are expected to add to  the speculation regarding the life span of the government.</p>

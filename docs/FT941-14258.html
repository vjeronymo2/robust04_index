			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Government plans further restrictions on legal aid The government is proposing to withdraw legal aid funding for cases which can be resolved without going to court as part of its strategy to cut legal-aid expenditure, Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, said yesterday. Publishing a management statement for the Legal Aid Board, the quango which administers the legal aid fund, the Lord Chancellor said legal aid had to be affordable and targeted towards those with the greatest need. Lord Mackay said that people should have access to legal services and to legal aid, but only where recourse to the law was the best solution. And they should pay what they can reasonably afford towards the cost of their cases. He also plans to introduce tighter controls on legal aid expenditure, establishing criteria for setting priorities and targeting the available money. The scheme was never intended to ensure that every citizen who had a good case would be able to go to court, he said. The cost of such a scheme would be prohibitive. Lord Mackay said legally aided services should continue to be provided primarily by solicitors in private practice. But he hopes to encourage law centres and citizens' advice bureaux to take on an increasing proportion of the work. In setting the levels of contributions to be paid towards cases, the criteria used will be broadly the same as those for other means-tested benefits. He also plans to extend standard fees for criminal legal aid work to cover 90 per cent of all cases in crown courts and magistrates' courts and to introduce standard fees for civil legal aid work. The Legal Aid Board yesterday welcomed Lord Mackay's statement, but appeared to distance itself from the suggestion that the Lord Chancellor would like to see firms competing for legal aid work on price against agreed quality standards. The Law Society, which last year took the Lord Chancellor to court over the introduction of standard fees for criminal legal aid work, condemned Lord Mackay's proposal to push ahead with competitive tendering.</p>

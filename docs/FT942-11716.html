			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Foreign miners not ready to invest in China - Progress has been made on liberalisation, but more is needed When representatives of some of the world's leading mining companies gathered in Beijing earlier this year for a minerals forum there was more than usual interest in China's proposals for a new regulatory regime governing foreign investment. China's mining sector has lagged well behind others, including notably oil and gas, in efforts to attract foreign involvement. Foreign investment and with it new technology is now critical to China if it is to make up for lost time in exploiting its mineral deposits to support a rapidly developing economy. Senior executives of companies like Teck Exploration of Canada, and CRA and BHP of Australia came away encouraged by what they had heard from Chinese officials. But to the question of whether they would commit large resources to exploration in China their response was: 'Not yet'. Mr Ian Gould, responsible for CRA's exploration worldwide, provided a typical industry view of China prospects at this stage. 'China is very much one of the countries we are monitoring carefully,' he said. 'But it is not quite at the point where CRA might be prepared to come in.' However, mining executives and academic experts involved in the minerals forum organised by the Pacific Economic Co-operation Council, which is sponsored by Pacific Rim countries, said China was making definite, albeit relatively slow, progress in clearing away barriers to foreign involvement. For the first time, according to Mr Gould, Chinese officials had begun speaking publicly about a specific 'contract of work' for mining ventures that would help facilitate negotiations that might otherwise become bogged down under cumbersome state mining legislation. Among regional countries, Indonesia has used the 'contract of work' approach to good effect in attracting foreign investment. Foreign miners believe the Chinese should follow the Indonesian model. Mr Fu Mingke, deputy director of the Ministry of Geology's development bureau admitted in an address to the forum that a 1986 mining law was now 'incompatible' with China's own market-oriented economy. It was also 'incomparable' with mining laws internationally. He acknowledged that the framing of a mining law would be complex and time-consuming, and therefore in the meantime China would 'develop a standard investment agreement (or contract). . . as a document supplemental to the mining regulations'. Mr Allen Clark, assistant director of Resources Programmes at the East-West centre in Hawaii, said there had been a 'very substantial change' in China's basic approach to opening the country to foreign miners. The country still had some way to go, however, before it could be regarded as an appealing location. Indications that the government was planning a 'resources tax' of up to 30 per cent suggested that the Chinese were not yet ready to fall into line internationally on standard royalties of between 1 and 5 per cent. Mining companies entering China now might be liable to an effective tax rate of 45 to 55 per cent, including taxes on profits and other levies, compared with an international average of 30 to 40 per cent. China, according to Mr Clark, was also mistaken in its apparent strategy of offering marginal projects to foreign miners rather than 'green field' sites. Chinese officials, fearful of criticism that they might be selling out the country's birthright, are excessively concerned about a foreign miner happening upon a high-grade and very profitable deposit. But in the end, foreign mining experts believe, enormous pressures on the mining sector from the China's leadership to provide more of the country's base metal and other mineral requirements will inevitably force speedier liberalisation. Mr James Dorian, co-ordinator of the China Energy Project at Hawaii's East-West Centre, pointed out at the forum that while China's mining industry ranked fourth in the world in output value, it was operating well below its potential. China, in fact, had a 'very low' per capita production of metals and minerals. Billions of dollars were required, Mr Dorian said, to modernise the industry, which was suffering from 'numerous problems', including low efficiencies in recovery, production and utilisation, outdated mining equipment and technology and severe transport bottlenecks. He added, however, that companies interested in business opportunities in China would need to 'remain flexible and patient' in seeking to understand not only the industry, but the 'often confusing' bureaucratic systems. 'The planned expansion and modernisation of China's mining industry will require tremendous influx of foreign technology and financing,' he said. 'Firms that are able to establish a successful track record today in China may be able to reap more substantial rewards in the long term.'</p>

			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Business Travel: Why agents are 'going global' - The expected deal between American Express and Thomas Cook Business travel agents are getting fewer but bigger - a fact that will not have been missed by any company with a sizeable travel budget. This trend towards bigger agencies with wider geographic reach (the agents like to call it 'going global') is likely to be confirmed today, with the expected announcement that American Express is buying large parts of the Thomas Cook travel agency business. Alongside the combined networks of the US agency Carlson and the French-based Wagonlit, which formed a business travel joint venture earlier this year, American Express will rank as one of two agencies with a claim to broad reach in both the US and Europe. None of this is likely to make much difference to the average travelling businessperson. It will be noted, however, in the travel departments of big companies around the world as a sign of the continuing reshaping of the business travel market. Perhaps one question above lies behind the latest deal: in future, why will big companies need travel agents at all? These intermediaries traditionally have performed two functions: collecting and sorting information (about schedules, fares and the like) and using their size (where they have it) to negotiate better prices or obtain preferential treatment for their customers. Due largely to advances in information technology, both roles are under threat. Computers make the job of sifting information much easier, as well as enabling companies to keep better track internally of the travel needs of their staff. This in turn has has made it easier for companies with big travel budgets to go straight to the airlines to negotiate their own volume discounts. IBM, for instance, says: 'We negotiate rates directly with some of the major carriers, and the agents simply implement those (agreements.)' Some of the biggest US companies - including General Motors, Merck and Black &amp; Decker - want to take this one step further. Through a joint company called Business Travel Contractors, they are proposing to pool their buying power to force the airlines to give them better rates. As part of the deal, the airlines would not pay any agents' commissions, and would stop issuing frequent flyer miles to these companies' employees. If agents have no role in negotiating prices, or even the choice of airline, the commissions on ticket sales, which form the bulk of their income, will come under increasing threat. The combination of new low-cost airlines and a move by many companies to reduce their use of business-class has brought down the average ticket price, with direct consequences on commissions (a standard agent's commission is around 10 per cent of the ticket price.) In this environment, it is not surprising to see some consolidation in the business travel agency business. Also, by extending their network geographically, the agencies hope to increase their value to their biggest customers by providing information and negotiating muscle in overseas markets. As in other service industries that rely on multinational companies for their income, the conventional wisdom now holds that big is better. 'Either you need to be a global company, or you need to be a very good niche player,' says Travis Tanner, president of Carlson. 'There isn't a very good chance of survival in the middle market.' One reason, runs the argument, is that big companies prefer to use fewer agents. 'North America is leading the charge, followed closely by Europe,' says Tanner. Is consolidation among agencies good for the business customer? To the extent that being bigger brings down an agent's costs (by as much as 30-40 per cent, says Tanner,) yes - though the disruption in service that often accompanies takeovers in service industries may counterbalance this. Also, the bigger agents should have more power to negotiate lower fares in international markets, though this is an argument that the agents admit has yet to be proven. Perhaps most significantly, though, scale will justify the investments in new technology that the biggest agents plan to make in the years ahead. Control of information is the most significant factor that is likely to justify their continued existence over the long term, since even the biggest companies will be able to rival the intermediaries in the international travel markets. Facing shrinking commissions from airlines, the agents are already trying to persuade big companies that they should pay fees for their services. Providing a service that justifies those fees is the challenge for the rest of this decade.</p>

			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / People: Ken Inglis moves to Fleming Why should Ken Inglis, chief-executive designate of Threadneedle Asset Management, chuck up the opportunity of putting his mark on one of London's biggest and newest firms of fund managers to join the old-fashioned Fleming Investment Management group whose funds under management are noticeably smaller? Inglis, 50, trained as an actuary with Edinburgh-based Scottish Provident in the early 1960s, and switched into investment management in 1972. In 1983 he moved to London to head research at stockbrokers Phillips &amp; Drew and in 1990 returned to fund management as chief executive of Allied Dunbar Asset Management. Inglis portrays his latest move as natural career progression. Having worked for a traditional Scottish life company, a big institutional broker, and the fund management side of a 'highly successful' direct sales company, he was tempted by the challenge of managing the investment arm of an old-established merchant bank. Robert Fleming, whose fund management business ranges from managing pension funds to the Save &amp; Prosper unit trust operation, is one of the great names in the investment business. However, its investment performance has not always been up to scratch and industry-watchers believe that the decision to bring in an outsider is an admission that it could do considerably better. John Manser, Fleming's chief executive, describes Inglis as Fleming's 'chief investment officer' and says his task will be to achieve Fleming's strategic aim of becoming 'the best performing investment management business in the UK'. Inglis, who joins on June 1 as chairman of Fleming Investment Management, replaces Iain Saunders, 46, who has done the job for four years. He has been appointed deputy chairman of Robert Fleming Asset Management with 'a business expansion brief'. (See Observer)</p>

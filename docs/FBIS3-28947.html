			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Yun Sun-hwan: "North Korea-China Border Trade"] </F>   [Text] As North Korea-China border trade is expanding  rapidly, the border areas along the Yalu and Tumen Rivers emerge  as "strategic markets" that will lead North Korea to open its  economy. North-South direct trade is still minimal, and there  are limitations on the types of goods to trade. Therefore, it  has been proposed that ROK business corporations positively  utilize North Korea-China border trade as a means to promote  "indirect North-South trade in order to lead North Korea to open  its market and promote economic cooperation with North Korea."    The North Korean Economy Research Center of the Korea  Development Institute released a "Report on North Korea-China  Border Trade" on 11 February. The report says North Korea-China  border trade, which is promoted in the form of barter trade, has  been rapidly expanding by over 20 percent a year since the start  of the nineties thanks to the successive measures by the  governments of the two countries to expand bilateral trade.  Even though exact figures have not been made public, the volume  of North Korea-China border trade is estimated at over $100  million in 1990 and over $240 million in 1992, which accounts  for 35 percent of the total volume of bilateral trade. However,  in many cases, business corporations involved in North  Korea-China border trade tend to report reduced amounts of trade  to authorities concerned to reduce customs duties and taxes.  Therefore, the volume of border trade is estimated to be over 50  percent of the total volume of trade ($300 million).    Border barter trade, which can be said to be rather  primitive  and unusual compared to other forms of international trade, is  expanding rapidly between North Korea and China. This is  because North Korea faces very serious shortages of daily  necessities and hard currency. Through border trade, North Korea  imports such daily necessities as textile goods (36 percent),  groceries (31 percent), and chemical, electric, and machinery  goods (17 percent) from China. In return, North Korea exports  mineral products, fishery products, and antiques to China. Both  countries prefer border barter trade over ordinary trade because  they face shortages of foreign reserves and have no appropriate  credit transaction system.    Therefore, to expand border trade, the two countries have  reportedly taken measures to ease various restrictions and give  tax breaks. Special customs rates, a mere 50 percent of  ordinary rates, are applied to almost all goods in border trade,  and procedures of trade have been simplified. The Chinese  Government's "measure to ease trade management" eliminated  almost all import restrictions toward the end of 1992, and a  $180 million border trade contract covering 30 items of goods,  the largest amount over the 10-year period, was signed at a  North Korea-Jilin, China, border-trade fair last May. In fact,  border smuggling trade, which is called "peddling," had been  prevalent under governmental tacit approval. Therefore, the  Chinese Government's measure to activate border trade is  described as an approval of such "peddling trade."    Border trade is growing in areas along the Yalu and Tumen  Rivers, close to the three Northeastern Provinces of China --  Jilin, Liaoning, and Heilongjiang, and the Yanbian Korean  Autonomous Prefecture of the Jilin Province and the border areas  close to the prefecture are the most prospering markets. North  Korea reportedly opened approximately 140 Chinese goods markets  in Sinuiju of North Pyongan Province, Manpo of Chagang Province,  and other areas last year to expand border trade with China.    The Korea Development Institute says: "In case North  Korea-China border trade continuously expands, domestic business  corporations must use North Korea-China border areas as a  forward base for indirectly leading North Korea to open its  economy." The institute also says that toward that end,  domestic business corporations must have Chinese border-trade  companies as agents or sign work agreements with Chinese  border-trade companies to join in border trade in this region.  The institute also says: There are "risks in trade" because of  the infrastructural problem and the credit problem. However,  given the fact that North-South trade is now being promoted  through third countries, North Korea-China border trade will  become an important means to lead North Korea to sell ROK goods  in the North Korean market and open its economy.</p>

			<p>940927 FT  27 SEP 94 / Sofirad chief Dutaret quits Mr Jean-Louis Dutaret yesterday resigned as head of Sofirad, a French state holding company with media interests, following a judge's decision last week to investigate his involvement in the Carignon affair. The judge is trying to establish a possible link between Lyonnaise des Eaux bankrolling a newspaper supporting Mr Alain Carignon's re-election as mayor of Grenoble and the utility's subsequent gain of the city's water contract. Before heading Sofirad last January, Mr Dutaret was a close aide to Mr Carignon, who resigned as communications minister in July to contest the same charge of being 'in receipt of misused corporate funds' as levelled against Mr Dutaret. Meanwhile, pressure is growing on Mr Gerard Longuet to resign as trade and industry minister in the row over improper funding of his holiday house.</p>

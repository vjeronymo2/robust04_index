			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / Letter: Directive on copyright law Sir, It was reported in the FT that the EC software directive may be in jeopardy ('Brussels fears for software directive', April 17). This directive was described as aiming to extend copyright laws to computer software. This is not quite accurate. In several member states, including the UK, software is already protected by national copyright law. The directive will require all member states to, inter alia, bring in national legislation to protect computer software by copyright law. Depending on the final form of the directive, the UK may need to amend the Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988. E. Singleton, Bristows Cooke &amp; Carpmael, 10 Lincoln's Inn Fields, WC2</p>

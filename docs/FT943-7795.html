			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Food &amp; Drink: The Scottish feast, from haggis to a dram - Philippa Davenport travels to Edinburgh and finds delights for lovers of beef and bread, fish and fowl The British branch of the Scotch Beef Club was launched in style. The sun shimmered on the firth of Forth as we drove from Edinburgh to the venue, Hopetoun House. There, we were greeted on velvet lawns by the skirl of bagpipes and a gunfire salute of champagne corks. The gala dinner was a multi-course affair. Apart from beef there was a natty presentation of haggis: little timbales of the stuff served on beds of neeps and tatties with a chive and whisky jus. The wines with dinner were a splendidly generous selection which flowed as freely as the champagne beforehand. A 17-year-old single malt whisky accompanied coffee. I had forgotten how handsome the city of Edinburgh is with its wide, hilly streets, surprise vistas and so much 18th and 19th century architecture; all the more handsome now that many buildings have been cleaned or are in the process of being given a facelift. Clarissa Dickson Wright gave me a refresher-course tour and my first glassy glimpse of the new festival theatre. Ex-Books for Cooks in London, now Global Gourmet (tel: 031-221 1101) and mastermind behind the new bookshop at Scobie Mackintosh's kitchen equipment emporium, she was the ideal guide. How lucky the inhabitants of Edinburgh are to have so many good fishmongers. There are more than 60, according to John Moore of the Sea Fish Authority. I doubt that any other British city of the same size could boast half so many that are half so good. George Armstrong, of Raeburn Place (031-315 2033), has its own smokehouse at the back. Not to be missed by those who love cheese is Ian Mellis, of Victoria Street (031-226 6215), a young cheesemonger who ripens and sells only farm-made British and Irish cheeses. Mellis is passionate about his subject and knowledgeable. Tastings are encouraged. The shop is small and cool with a creamily painted interior that gives it the feel of a dairy. The most compulsive shop of all, however, the essential stop-over if you have time to visit one shop only, is Valvona &amp; Crolla in Elm Row (031-556 6066). I had heard that it was the best delicatessen in Edinburgh but it struck me as the most exciting I had been to in any part of the British Isles for many a year. The small shop front and the window display unpromisingly filled with miniature drink bottles in no way prepare you for the interior, which soars to cathedral heights, with brightly coloured Lazaroni amaretti biscuit tins hanging high up in the roof. Seldom have I seen so many temptingly desirable foods packed into one place. Scouring the shelves is what Christmas stocking dreams are made of. Upstairs is a large room where wine tastings, talks and cookery demonstrations are held. Tucked behind the touristy frontage of The Witchery, near the Castle in Castlehill, is The Secret Garden restaurant (031-225 5613). Built more or less into the walls of Edinburgh Castle it is a good place to lunch. Decorative, airy, neither too intimate nor too grand, it conveys a definite sense of treat and the set lunch menu offers good value. The owner, James Thomson, clearly enjoys the art of presentation and understands his market well: bookings are consistently high throughout the year. The Scots have a fine reputation for good plain soups and baking. Their basic baked goods are unrivalled. Think of drop scones, oatcakes, shortbread, Dundee cake, many sorts of bread and morning rolls. Television presenter and food writer Grace Mulligan told me that in Dundee, where she was born and brought up, morning rolls were delivered house to house, just like milk and newspapers, in time for breakfast each morning. Sadly this service is no longer available but Rough &amp; Fraser of Kinghorne Road, Dundee (0382-825391) continues to bake morning rolls in the time-honoured way. The product is hand-made from hard wheat that is left to ferment for about 10 hours then baked at a very high temperature to produce a crisp crust and very soft crumb. This is bread to eat within hours of baking (or to freeze for eating later). These bakers still work through the night and the back door of their premises is open from 11pm until 5am. You can watch them at work and buy fresh morning rolls to take home for breakfast. Scotland is famous for game, both feathered and furred. Grouse is arguably the most exciting bird to shoot and the finest to eat. The more simply it is cooked the better, yet so infrequent a treat is it for most of us, that I thought it might be helpful to detail how to roast it. To carry the Scottish theme through the whole meal, the grouse might be prefaced by a wild mushroom soup or by ripe melon or figs and wafer thin slices of Sara and Leo Barclay's Rannoch smoked venison (0882-632344). Oatcakes, Bonchester and other fine Scottish cheeses would make an appropriate finish. ROAST GROUSE WITH BERRY GRAVY (serves 4) Four fine birds; eight thin cut rashers of unsmoked streaky bacon or strips of pork back fat; 2-3 oz raspberries, fraises du bois or blackberries; a few slivers of lemon peel (optional); a good splash of wine or a few drops of appropriately flavoured fruit vinegar; 8 fl oz stock; a little butter and four fluted rounds of bread. Smear the untrussed birds lightly all over with well seasoned butter. Stretch the bacon rashers with the back of a knife, cut into lengths as required and lay them (or the strips of pork back fat) protectively over the breasts of the birds. Secure the striped waistcoats with a criss-cross of string tied round each bird. Slip the berries and a flake of butter into the body cavities, adding a sliver of lemon peel if blackberries are used. Lay the birds breast down on a rack in a roasting pan and cook at 425'F (220'C) gas mark 7 for 12-15 minutes depending on size. Turn the birds over and roast for 12-15 minutes more. Then strip off the waistcoats, baste the birds once and slip them back into the oven for a final five minutes or so until the breasts no longer feel soft and spongy when pressed with a fingertip. Using the handle of a wooden spoon, tip the berries from the body cavities into the roasting pan. Then let the birds rest for 10 minutes or so in a warm place, laying them on thick soft rounds of toast or fried bread spread with the sauteed and crushed grouse livers. Add the liquids to the roasting pan, scrape up the meaty sediment from the pan base and crush the fruit into it. Boil up and simmer until reduced to a few spoonfuls of fruitily gamey jus. Strain to extract fruit debris and spoon the jus over the birds. Serve with plenty of peppery watercress and game chips or potato sticks, or bowls of creamy bread sauce and crisply fried breadcrumbs.</p>

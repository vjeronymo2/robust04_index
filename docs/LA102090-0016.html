			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROPOSITIONS 128, 135  </P> <P> I read with interest Peter Steinhart's column ("Giving Our Children a Break,"  Opinion, Oct. 14) advocating passage of Prop. 128, Big Green.  </P> <P> I was an early supporter and financial backer of Big Green. As I considered the  proposal more thoroughly, I sadly concluded it is a typical "deep thinkers"  response of correcting bad behavior with bad law. It won't solve our problems.  Ultimately, it will exacerbate them by forcing exorbitant future costs on  society and stymie targeted efforts to deal intelligently with specific  problems. Policy often has undiscovered consequences. Big Green would be a Big  Mistake.  </P> <P> KIP DELLINGER, Los Angeles  </P></p>

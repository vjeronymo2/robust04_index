			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / International Company News: Chevron signals interest in Kazakhstan pipeline project CHEVRON, the fourth-largest US oil and gas company, has signed a memorandum of understanding expressing its interest in joining a consortium that is planning to build a pipeline to transport oil from the former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan. The San Francisco-based company stressed yesterday it was not yet a formal partner in the consortium, which is led by the government of Oman. Chevron added it would only consider joining the consortium once the pipeline had been constructed. Chevron is, however, already deeply involved in the exploration for oil in Kazakhstan, having last month signed an agreement with the republic that could lead to the multi-billion dollar development of an area covering about 4,000 sq km. Oman, which announced the pipeline plan, said the completion cost could range between Dollars 700m and Dollars 1.6bn, depending on the route chosen from Kazakhstan. The pipeline plan calls for the shipment of oil from the former Soviet republic to world markets along one of eight possible routes - these could run to the Mediterranean, the Black Sea or the Persian Gulf. Oman and Kazakhstan last week signed an accord to form the pipeline consortium. Officials in the energy industry say Chevron is just one of several possible consortium partners being canvassed by the two governments.</p>

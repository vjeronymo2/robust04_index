			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Observer: A vision of Scholey So what next for Sir David Scholey, the man responsible for assembling Britain's only half- decent competitor to Wall Street's powerful investment banks? After 30 years on the job, he has handed in his notice as a director and plans to retire upstairs to join the 86-year-old Lord Roll in the president's office. Warburg stresses that Sir David will continue to devote his time 'largely to the business of the group'. But he is not yet 59, and the young turks at Warburg might prefer it if he went off and did his own thing for a while and left them to run the show. There is no shortage of jobs. If British Telecom ever decided to split the role of chairman and chief executive, Sir David, as one of BT's senior directors, would be a natural chairman. Then there is the question of the succession at GEC, where both Lords Prior and Weinstock are getting a bit long in the tooth. Sir David would be a diplomatic choice as chairman while the City decided whether young Simon Weinstock was up to taking over from his dad. If Sir David really has tired of the commercial grind, there is always the BBC, whose board he has just joined. The chairman's job does not fall vacant until November 1996, but Marmaduke Hussey is over 70 and might be persuaded to take early retirement. Given that Sir David didn't get the Bank of England governor's job, how about giving him the BBC as a consolation prize? It's hard to imagine him disappearing from public view for long.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The United States Should Refrain From </F> Indiscriminate Trade Offensive"]    [Text] Even amid the traffic hell created on the way home  and on the return to Seoul, we enjoyed the Lunar New Year  holiday. However, the situation outside the nation was not  quiet. In addition to the North Korean nuclear issue to which  the world is directing attention, the U.S. trade offensive has  been strengthened with each passing day. The import of rice and  beef has now become an old story. Following the pressure to  open financial markets, expansion of automobile imports and  protection of intellectual properties have become the imminent  issues. Besides, in a meeting with the ROK minister of commerce  and industry a few days ago, the U.S. Ambassador to the ROK made  a strong protest against our court's decision to put the  representative of the Korean branch of the U.S. Amway Company,  who was previously brought to a summary indictment, on trial.  He also expressed a deep regret for disadvantages inflicted on  U.S. business firms last year by our government reversing its  decision to designate firms for the mobile telecommunications  project in our country. It was learned that during "talks for  economic cooperation" to be held in Washington this week, the  United States will demand the positive improvement in the tax  system, custom clearance, financial restrictions, and  management-labor disputes, as well as for establishment of an  organization within the Economic Planning Board to exclusively  handle the elimination of trade friction and improvement of the  investment environment. In a nutshell, a special institute  should be organized as a government office to promptly settle  complaints put forward by U.S. business firms now operating in  the ROK.    It appeared that with the resolution of Uruguay Round [UR]  negotiations, the reorganization of the world trade order came  to a temporary settlement. However, without even moments for a  breath-taking thereafter, we became the target of concentrated  fire attack by the United States. The UR agreement is a  discriminative and unfair trade order which reflects the  interests of only a few big powers. However, since they  emphasized that this is the way for removing obstacles laid on  the road of world trade, we cooperated by opening even our rice  markets on which the nation's life depends. This being the case,  those who led this negotiation should direct their utmost  efforts on the operation of this system and should wait for its  achievements. However, the U.S. attitude totally contradicts  this. By taking advantage of the settlement of the  negotiations, the United States has launched a concentrated fire  attack on its trade partners, in particular, the ROK and Japan.  An offensive and defense battle between the United States and  Japan over the issue of establishing a so-called "standard of  numerical value" to objectively prove the extent of import of  automobiles and the degree of opening of insurance markets  continued to the current U.S.-Japan summit. However, the two  sides failed to bring about satisfactory results. In view of  the enormous imbalance in trade income and outgo between the  United States and Japan, the U.S. offensive against Japanese  markets has considerable persuasive power.    However, as for the case of the ROK which suffers red  figures  in trade with the United States, the indiscriminate U.S.  offensive is not only unfair but also insolent. The the United  States' act of picking a quarrel over the ROK court's decision  for trial and over the postponement of the mobile  telecommunications project, which was inevitable after the issue  developed into a heated political dispute, makes one doubt its  true intent, going beyond pure economic interests. The ROK  cannot import as many U.S. automobiles as U.S. imports of ROK  automobiles because of the different standard of income of ROK  consumers and their requirements, not because of trade barriers.  Frankly speaking, it is not likely that the one who wants to  buy a high-class U.S. automobile would give up its purchase  because of a high income tax imposed at home. We are not in the  position to revise our tax system merely for the sake of helping  the sale of U.S. automobiles. We hope to maintain sound trade  relations between the ROK and the United States and to promote  mutual understanding on such relations. However, this cannot be  achieved by unilateral pressure by one side and yielding to such  pressure by the other. Trade is an economic issue. However,  this issue would become very difficult to resolve if the  people's ill feeling is involved. We ask the United States to  exercise self-control so that ROK-U.S. trade relations would not  develop into relations in which people's ill feeling is involved.</p>

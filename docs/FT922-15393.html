			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Arts: King Henry IV Part 1 Adrian Noble's production of King Henry IV opened unevenly at Stratford a year ago, but improved considerably as the season went on and fell into shape when we saw Part 2 a few weeks later. Part 1 has now arrived at the Barbican and looks better than ever. One of the reasons is the maturing of Robert Stephens's Falstaff. In the early days at Stratford, he seemed altogether too clean and too likeable. Although he drank a lot, he did not seem vastly to overdo it. He was more a cynic than a coward. I compared him at the time to a QC at the Old Bailey. Now he has grown fatter and more dissolute. No-one seeing this production will be tempted to come down entirely on his side. The sight of Falstaff sticking his sword in the already dead Hotspur at the end is thoroughly unpleasant, and rightly so. The production as a whole has become much more structured. Partly this is because of the size of the wonderful Barbican stage. There is room to let the play develop and give it its full historical sweep: room, too, for point and counterpoint. An obvious example is the mock trial where Falstaff plays the king passing judgment on Prince Hal. It is much more poignant than at Stratford precisely because it is not cluttered: the whole stage is not used here, leaving a void to suggest what a small part of the world is the inn at Eastcheap. A smaller but no less telling illustration is the symmetry between Hotspur and Mortimer saying goodbye to their wives before setting off to battle. They are quite beautifully juxtaposed. Symmetry indeed has become the key note of the production. Julian Glover's king ponders on the similarities between his own ascent to the throne and the possibility that he will be overthrown in turn. He envies the one-time kingmaker, Northumberland, because his son, Hotspur, seems so much more born to the role of king than Hal, the heir apparent. Michael Maloney's Hal broods on the comparison that he knows his father makes. At the same time, both the king and Hal are essentially peace-loving at heart, if only because the king has learned from experience the bitterness of civil war. All that comes out more clearly at the Barbican than it did at Stratford. The battle scenes are also more subtlely handled: some of the pointless thrashing about in the dark has been eliminated. It is possible that I overpraise because I know from Stratford how Noble develops his themes in Part 2. Rarely can the two parts have been played together so well. After 3 1/2 hours at the Barbican it seemed as if the second interval had arrived and one could have straight back into the second part when the king comes into his own and you realise that he is the dominant figure of his age. But for that you will have to wait a few more weeks. For my part, I look forward to Maloney playing Henry V. The Barbican Theatre In repertory until June 13 Box Office 071-638 8891</p>

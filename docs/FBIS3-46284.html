Thondup, who arrived here Jan. 18 to attend the Jan. 23  World  Freedom Day activities, said that the Dalai Lama hopes such an  office can help enhance cultural exchanges between Han and  Tibetan peoples.    Thondup, who is visiting at the invitation of the Republic  of  China [ROC] Chapter of the World League for Freedom and  Democracy, made the remarks during a party hosted by the  Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission in his honor.    Thondup said he was received warmly by President Li Teng-hui  and Premier Lien Chan when he first visited Taiwan last May.    Thondup added that the Dalai Lama's schedule for 1994 was  full, but he hoped that he could visit Taiwan soon.    Thondup noted that the Dalai Lama's government-in-exile has  set up liaison offices in Japan, France, Britain, Switzerland  and the United States in the past few years.    Chang Chun-yi, chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs  Commission, said that Thondup's visit worked to break the ice  and increase understanding between Han and Tibetan peoples.</p>

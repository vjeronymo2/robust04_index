"We had  three different people keeping track. He looked at the record book earlier  today and said, 'All I care about tonight is going out and getting rebounds.'  And he got a ton of them."  </P> <P> It was the fourth consecutive City Central League title for Lincoln (25-1,  10-0). The Hornets' City Central League record during that span is 39-1.  </P> <P> Bracey Simmons scored 18 points for Hoover (2-21, 1-9).  </P> <P> In other City Central League games:  </P> <P> San Diego 54, Christian 52 -- Free throws gave San Diego the edge in the fourth  quarter. Clark James was six for six from the line and Milton Miller was five  for six. James scored 18 points and Miller added 16 for San Diego (17-4, 8-2).  Christian is now 12-11 and 4-6.  </P> <P> Crawford 74, St. Augustine 51 -- Tracy Halton hit 10 of 14 from the field to  lead visiting Crawford (16-8, 6-4) with 22 points.  </P> <P> City Eastern League  </P> <P> Point Loma 54, Patrick Henry 53 -- The final day of the regular season began  with the league looking at a possible five-way tie.  </P> <P> Morse and Point Loma each were tied atop the league standings at 6-3 with a  chance to win the title outright. Patrick Henry, Serra and Madison, all a game  behind the leaders at 5-4, played in hopes of gaining a rare five-way tie.  </P> <P> Point Loma held off a furious Patrick Henry rally in the final minute to clinch  the title at Point Loma High. Over at Morse, Serra did its part while searching  for a co-title, knocking off Morse, 70-62.  </P> <P> Madison tied Serra and Morse for second at 6-4 with a 98-70 victory over Mira  Mesa.  </P> <P> Patrick Henry (16-10, 6-4) led for most of the game. With just over a minute to  play, Point Loma's Beau Pack made a three-pointer, and Rob Quintana made one of  two free throws to to give Point Loma (16-10, 7-3) a six-point lead.  </P> <P> Kenny Caesar then made a three-pointer for Patrick Henry, Bart Brandenburg made  a jumper in the lane, Jason Lonsdale stole a pass and Patrick Henry called  timeout with 7 seconds. Terence Hamilton missed from a step behind the free  throw line, and Brandenburg's follow-up missed.  </P> <P> Serra 70, Morse 62 -- Jermaine Jordan and Conrad Jones, a pair of quick  5-foot-9 guards, controlled the game for Serra (14-9, 6-4) by combining for 35  points and consistently beating the Morse press.  </P> <P> Jones (16 points) did his damage mostly from the free throw line, making 11 of  12, six of six in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> Jordan, who scored 19 points and made seven of 12 free throws, was more  damaging when he wasn't scoring. He had five steals, five rebounds and  exhibited an uncanny ability to find the open player under the basket.  </P> <P> Serra took a 34-27 halftime lead and increased it to 41-29 2 minutes into the  third quarter. It maintained that 10-point advantage for most of the second  half.  </P> <P> In the final 2 minutes, the pressure began to rattle the Conquistadors.  Leading, 64-54, with 1:58 to play, Morse's Jimmie Rose was fouled making a  layup and made the free throw to close the gap to 64-57 with 1:44 left. Serra  committed a turnover and with 1:36 to play, Darrell Lewis sank a three-pointer  to close the margin to 64-60. Serra called timeout, then missed, and Rose set  off on the fast break. Looking for a foul, he drove into Maurice Wade, who held  his ground and took the charge as Rose's shot rolled off the rim.  </P> <P> Morse, leading the league to start the week, dropped its final two games. Serra  has won four in a row.

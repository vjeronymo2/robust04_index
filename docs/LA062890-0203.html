			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WATER DISTRICT SAYS GOVERNOR'S FEE PROPOSAL IS ALL WET  </P> <P> The Municipal Water District on Wednesday joined state water lobbyists in  criticizing Gov. George Deukmejian's recently unveiled list of budget cuts,  which include plans for a complicated fee system that would probably boost  water bills statewide.  </P> <P> In a letter circulated to other water districts in Orange County, municipal  district officials said they are "vehemently opposed to (the) proposal of more  fees for water quality and quantity activities" and urged other county water  districts to write letters of opposition to legislators.  </P> <P> "We're trying to get the word out," said Stanley E. Sprague, general manager of  the district, one of two wholesalers of water in Orange County. "We are going  to get nailed arbitrarily. It just is not a good deal."  </P> <P> As part of a proposal on widespread cuts to balance the state's $55-billion  budget by July 1, the Deukmejian Administration has suggested that, among other  things, the state Water Resources Control Board be financed almost entirely  with regulatory fees, which would be charged to local water districts, then  passed on to customers, Sprague said.  </P> <P> Programs that deal with water rights and water quality -- including stream,  lake and wetlands research -- would be paid for through the fee system rather  than the state budget.  </P> <P> For instance, under the proposal, Anaheim would pay up to $325,000 a year to  support such programs, he said.  </P> <P> The Municipal Water District's call for support was being circulated as  Deukmejian formally released his seven pages of budget cuts, aimed at saving  the state more than $3.6 billion.  </P> <P> With the fees, the state could save about $38 million from the general fund,  said Connie Barker, director of government relations for the Sacramento-based  Assn. of California Water Agencies.  </P> <P> But, Barker said, some believe that the fees amount to a tax increase that  would eventually reach into the pockets of water customers.  </P> <P> Barker said her group had been surprised by the proposal. The group began  notifying its members June 21 in a three-page letter that said the proposal  "amounts to bailing out of the state's general fund by making local agencies  provide the bailout money."  </P> <P> "Such a bailout approach is not appropriate," the letter stated.  </P> <P> Water officials said they are particularly dismayed that the issue bubbled up  less than a week before the budget is to be up for a vote.  </P> <P> Sprague said legislators will be tempted to pass the proposal because they have  no time to study its long-term effect on water programs and users throughout  the state, who would pay more money despite efforts to conserve water in the  Southland's 4-year-old drought.  </P> <P> Legislators "need money real quick," Sprague said, referring to the budget  crisis the state is in. "They will not have the luxury of time."  </P></p>

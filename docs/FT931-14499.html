			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / International Company News: Turkey brings in new debt queueing system TURKEY has introduced new rules on foreign borrowing. The decree comes amid concern over Turkey's growing foreign debt, which according to provisional figures to September has risen to Dollars 56bn, up from Dollars 50bn at the end of 1991. The reform introduces a queueing system for all borrowing by government affiliated agencies to prevent the treasury being crowded out by other Turkish borrowers. Hitherto the system was applied only to loans which carried a government guarantee. Officials said the new rule was aimed at 'putting discipline back into the market'. The treasury is particularly anxious about the Ankara municipality. Rated BBB by Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, the municipality has tapped both syndicated loan and bond markets to finance the Dollars 660m construction of the city's underground system. The treasury guaranteed the municipality's latest borrowing - a Dollars 220m seven-year loan agreed before Christmas, the first tranche of a Dollars 455m facility for the Metro. The loan carries an interest rate of Libor plus 2.6 per cent, with a participation fee of 2.72 per cent. Bankers view such margins as generous and officials were clearly worried the issue could be a very unfavourable benchmark for Turkish risk. Part of Turkey's debt increase is due to disadvantageous cross rates, particularly the weak dollar against the D-Mark, which added almost Dollars 2bn to the debt stock in the third quarter.</p>

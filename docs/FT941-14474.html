			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: All just an illusion? Sir, Joe Rogaly appears to have left the FT and joined the Socialist Worker ('It is a moral issue', January 18). Apparently all Anglo-American capitalism is good for is smashing everything and pouring scorn on professors and social workers. Clearly, the failure of collectivism and the success of free market capitalism worldwide is an illusion foisted on us by the evil Thatcher and her cronies. Come back the 1970s, all is forgiven] Richard Kevern, 14 Wraysbury Park Drive, Emsworth, Hampshire PO10 7UU</p>

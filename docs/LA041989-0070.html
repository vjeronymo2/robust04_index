			<p><P> April 19, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> VIET GROUP ENDS RECALL DRIVE AFTER COUNCILMAN APOLOGIZES  </P> <P> Leaders in Orange County's Vietnamese community accepted an apology from  Westminster City Councilman Frank Fry Jr. on Tuesday and ended a recall effort  initiated after he made some "insensitive remarks" at a recent council meeting.  </P> <P> "Instead of demonstrating against him, we're going to circulate his statement  of apology," said Chuyen V. Nguyen, chairman of a Vietnamese ad hoc committee,  which formed last week to represent more than 30 groups in Orange County's  Vietnamese community.  </P> <P> The uproar began when the South Vietnamese Armed Forces Day Committee was  denied a parade permit by the Westminster council. At a meeting televised on a  local cable channel, Fry told the veterans' group that they should commemorate  their war dead on a U.S. holiday.  </P> <P> The councilman added, "If you want to be South Vietnamese, go back to South  Vietnam."  </P> <P> More than 5,000 flyers and 500 posters attacking Fry were printed in Vietnamese  by the ad hoc committee, which planned to kick off the recall drive Tuesday  afternoon in the county's Little Saigon area, Nguyen said.  </P> <P> Posters bearing a smiling photo of the retired grocery clerk carried the words:  "We voted for you last year. We feel sorry for you this year!" A headline above  Fry's photograph read, "The Vietnamese Community Is Being Insulted."  </P> <P> Fry could not be reached on Tuesday. But Dr. Daniel H. Ninburg, chairman of the  county Human Relations Commission, released a statement that had been drafted  on Fry's behalf by commission executive director Rusty Kennedy.  </P> <P> "I would like to apologize for my statements that have caused this outcry," the  Fry statement read.  </P> <P> " . . . I did not intend to insult the right of all people to take pride in  their ethnic, racial or national heritage. I did not intend to belittle the  sacrifice made by our allies, the South Vietnamese, during the Vietnam War, nor  did I mean that those who died in the war should not be honored."  </P></p>

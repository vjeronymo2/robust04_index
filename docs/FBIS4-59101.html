			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unscheduled commentary] </F>   [Text] O beloved ones in dear Aden, O beloved ones in  steadfast Abyan, O beloved ones in glorious Shabwah, O beloved  ones in all governorates of the cherished Republic of Yemen, O  brothers and beloved ones in this good land: The gang of  apostasy and secession has long made you taste the bitterness of  all types of woes and agony. This criminal rebelling gang,  which has abandoned all noble values and honorable manners, has  been spitting out the venom of its hidden grudge into the body  of the one Yemen for over two and a half decades. Today, and at  this decisive moment in the history of our people, it is pouring  the fire of its grudge onto the populated cities, thinking that  it will frighten the people and scare the army of unity and  constitutional legitimacy, which is advancing toward it like a  surging sea.    O honorable compatriots in the southern and eastern  governorates: Your sons and brothers in the army of unity and  democracy and constitutional legitimacy are scoring one victory  after another. They are continuing their march toward the dens  of this renegade gang. Help them achieve the missions you  entrusted to them--the mission of cutting off the fingers that  seek to disrupt the unity of Yemen, both land and man. It is  for the sake of this unity that fathers and forefathers have  struggled and sacrificed. It is the unity for which pure blood  was spilled and chaste souls were offered. It is unity which  restored the smile to all on 22 May 1990 and over which all  hearts rejoiced. It is unity which we will protect with our  souls and the pupils of our eyes. The forces of evil and  apostasy will not be able to undermine the sacredness of our  cherished unity for they are too weak to even harm the hair on a  camel's back.</p>

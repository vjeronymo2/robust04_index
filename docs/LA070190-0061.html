			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: **** KIRSTY MACCOLL "KITE" CHARISMA: ALBUMS RATED ON A SCALE OF  ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE (A CLASSIC).  </P> <P> Nine years after her first solo album, the daughter of the late Irish folk  giant Ewan MacColl, wife of big-time producer Steve Lillywhite (who did the  honors here) and session vocalist extraordinaire returns with what can only be  described as a contemporary folk-rock record, reminiscent of what the Kinks or  the Smiths would sound like if they were fronted by a real woman.  </P> <P> That's scarcely an idol comparison, either -- earwitness MacColl's offhandedly  breathtaking versions of the former's "Days" and the latter's "You Just Haven't  Earned It Yet, Baby."  </P> <P> More important, these and a third (McGarrigles) non-original aren't even the  best bits.  </P> <P> Propelled by indelible, whispering, bell-like melodies and  anything-but-textbook guitar textures from the likes of one-time Pretender  Robbie McIntosh and ex-Smiths star Johnny Marr, MacColl's own tunes are marked  by a gimlet-eyed sense of detail: "Innocence," "Fifteen Minutes," "Free World,"  "Don't Come the Cowboy With Me Sonny Jim!" and "What Do Pretty Girls Do?" --  there's not a cliched moment in the lot.  </P> <P> What's more, MacColl chases these pints of shimmering sarcasm with double shots  of tough love and compassion ("No Victims," "Mother's Ruin," "You and Me Baby,"  "End of a Perfect Day"). She sings all the harmonies, too. So what's a woman  gotta do to get noticed, shave her head? DON WALLER  </P></p>

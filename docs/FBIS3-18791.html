			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with UK Chancellor Kenneth Clarke by </F> Donald Macintyre; place and date not given]    [Text] It is all still in place. The infectious laugh,  the cigar -- a little bigger perhaps than it used to be -- and  the engaging tease at his own expense. Kenneth Clarke's famous  remark, for example, that the Conservative Party would stick to  manifesto promises but not necessarily to speeches made on a  "wet night in Dudley" has, he says, "gone down very badly in  Dudley."    Something has changed, however, though it probably has more  to do with the office than the man. This most famously candid  of politicians now measures his words just a little more  carefully. He plays, in the classic manner of Chancellors, a  straight bat on when taxes might start to come down, and on what  will happen next to interest rates.    Yes, he says, he has "heard the rumours" that he initially  disagreed with Eddie George, Governor of the Bank of England,  over the last cut in interest rates -- which is as near as he  will come to confirming that the Bank resisted a cut and they  ended up compromising about 0.25 per cent.    Despite this, he insists, he is already thinking of other  ways of extending the arm's-length relationship with the Bank,  which already publishes its inflation forecasts unfettered by  the old-style Treasury censorship and which now unilaterally  fixes the timing, though not the content, of rates. No, he is  not ready to share with the Independent what those ideas are.  And on independence of the central bank, he will follow past  practice and "give his candid views when I stop being  Chancellor."    On the, for some, burning question of whether that might  come sooner rather than later as a result of a leadership  crisis, he makes no effort to disguise that his hat remains in  the ring if and when the moment comes at a time of Mr Major's  own choosing. But if the party is serious about getting out of  what he has called its "dreadful hole," it needs to unite behind  its leader.    He adds with mild irritation: "Speculation is always fun,  but we have now reached the stage where there are about three or  four members of the Cabinet who cannot make a remark about the  weather without it being interpreted as a leadership bid."    Most of all, of course, political recovery from the "hole"  is  about the economic recovery. About which he is "more confident  now than I was at the time of the Budget, that we are going to  have a sustained recovery with low inflation." On the other  hand, he insists he has always been cautious about the way he  puts this; but if he makes the "right decisions" and if British  industry remains competitive, "then we are on to several good  years."    So when we can expect taxes to come down again? "I think  people would be cynical about tax-cutting that appeared to be  solely determined by the political timetable.... I do not  propose to cut taxes before we have recovery or before we have  healthier public finances. I think the objective of strong,  sustained economic growth has to override everything else."    What if public spending undershot this year as it did last  --  would he simply use it to reduce borrowing further, or would he  consider cutting taxes as soon as this November? He warns: "It  will require several years of tight public spending control in  order to hit the very ambitious target I have set for us of  getting back to break-even in the medium term." So is he ruling  out November 1994 tax cuts? "I will do what I did last year  which is to refuse to speculate about what I might and might not  do in November.... I might take people by surprise again."    Last week, Mr Clarke took a broad swing at excessive  salaries  at the top of industry. But that does not mean he is thinking  about increasing the top rate of tax. The man earning 35,000  pounds, he explains, is also on the top rate of tax. "I am not  going to put up the tax on the 35,000-pounds-a-year man because  he and I are annoyed about some particularly exceptional  chairman of a big company. I remember Nigel Lawson had disorder  in the Commons when in the Budget he took the top rate of tax  down. It was hard won and I do not intend to give it up easily.  Low marginal rates of taxation are very important in producing  a highly competitive economy."    Nor is he holding out much early prospect of broadening the  VAT base -- something he has always favoured, in principle. The  Government has just had a major controversy, he points out, over  VAT on fuel, rescued by his compensation package. "I think if  we were starting again we would have a much broader base with  VAT, but all Budgets start from where we are now and I will make  decisions about tax base according to the needs at the time...so  women with small feet can continue to have VAT-free shoes for  the foreseeable future."    This all sounds very much the programme of a politically  and economically prudent Chancellor. Where he perhaps differs  from his predecessors is in the role he sees for the Treasury  within government. It is not, he insists, just a matter of  saying no to "everything you can turn down." Control of public  spending under the new system devised by Norman Lamont is based  on "choices of priorities." He is pleased that cuts last year  were matched by increases in health and education.    "Since John Major came in we are developing a more  collective  way of running the government and that means the Treasury  presides over the spending round. But I try to ensure that as a  Cabinet we steer the money in ways that match policy.... I  regard the Treasury, the DTI, the Department of Employment, as  the three economic departments and I think the Treasury should  have a positive input into what I call supply-side economics.  And we should look at the consequences for business and the  real economy in the changes we make."    That sounds fine in theory. But has the Government not  failed the first big test of that -- the initiative for  injecting private finance into public sector infrastructure?    No, insists the Chancellor. The Government's opponents are  complaining, only four months after he set up a panel to take  the private finance drive forward, "that we have not got any new  railway lines yet."    "By the end of this Parliament we will have a different way  of investing in infrastructure in this country with much greater  use of private sector capital rather than the taxpayers' money."  Today he launches the British paper for the G7 jobs summit in  Detroit, convened by President Clinton -- an opportunity to  reinforce Britain's case within Europe for a deregulated labour  market. "We need to set an agenda for growth of an  employment-creating kind. That means you do have free-market  economics, low inflation, healthy public finances without big  government debts. It means creating a climate for enterprise  and risk investment, encouraging small and medium-sized  businesses. You have to deregulate...which means getting rid of  outdated laws on trades union recognition, restricting workers'  hours, paternity leave and minimum wages -- all the clutter that  is on the European statute book."    On Europe, he denied any Cabinet split. "The thing is, we  are in favour of it; we are in favour of a free-market, open  trading Europe.... We are against protectionism,  over-centralisation, over-regulation. If only people would look  at how that separates us from the Labour and the Liberal  parties."    He said the politicians would be "foolish" if they ignored  the fact a gap had opened up between European politicians and  public. Conservative MPs would find it easy to agree on a policy  opposing centralisation and over-regulation. "Today's argument  is what sort of European Union is going to be. I want to see  British Conservatives at the heart of the European Union arguing  with considerable ferocity for the kind of Union we want."    He has already all but ruled out a return to ERM [exchange  rate mechanism] in this Parliament. What about this century?  The argument over the ERM, he says, would only come back after  achieving a reasonable level of economic convergence. "We have  all got to have achieved low inflation, healthy public finances  and sustainable economic growth. When the big players are all  in that same position, we will find that the markets will give  us reasonably stable exchange rates, which I still regard as a  very desirable objective.    ``Only then is it worth talking about whether you need any  system to reinforce the markets to give you that stability of  exchange rate.''</p>

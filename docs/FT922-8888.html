			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / International Company News: Church &amp; Co in Japanese venture Church &amp; Co, the shoe maker and retailer, is increasing its interest in Japan by launching a joint venture with two Japanese partners. The group has been exporting its Northampton-made classic shoes to Japan for nearly 30 years and now sells more than 10,000 pairs a year. It is Church's fourth largest export market after France, Italy and the US. Mr Tony Gledhill, marketing director, said Church Japan would involve Otsuka Shoe, the group's distributor, and Stock &amp; Zenock, a men's clothing manufacturer. Church would hold a majority stake.

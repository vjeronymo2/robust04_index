			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, May 12 (XINHUA) -- Cable-stayed bridge  design in China will be advanced synchronously with this  industry in the world, according to a famous Chinese bridge  expert.    "It will be advancing towards spans of over 1,000 meters  sooner or later," Lin Yuanpei, general designer of the Yangpu  bridge -- the world's longest -- told over 200 foreign  specialists at a recent international symposium in this city.    He said that within a period of less than 20 years, China  has  proceeded to become one of the pioneers of the world in this  field.    In the mid-1970s, China had only one cable-stayed bridge  with  a 76-meter span.    In the 1990s, two huge bridges were set up across the  Huangpu  river in shanghai. Nanpu bridge, built in 1991, boasts a span  of 423 meters, and the Yangpu bridge, which was completed last  year, is 602 meters in length.    So far, the country has 40-odd stay cables.    Lin also said that a third stay cable for Shanghai is on the  drawing board and is expected to be finished in 1996.    The four-day symposium received over 90 theses on the latest  developments in the field.    Some well-known experts took part in the meeting, including  Li Guohao, honorary president of Tongji University.</p>

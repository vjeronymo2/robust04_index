			<p><P> March 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PENTAGON PLANS $877-MILLION ANTI-DRUG EFFORT;  </P> <P> MILITARY: THE EXPANDED INITIATIVES INCLUDE SPECIAL TRAINING AND SURVEILLANCE.  IT IS A REVERSAL OF DEFENSE DEPARTMENT RELUCTANCE TO JOIN THE WAR ON NARCOTICS.  </P> <P> The Pentagon, unveiling an $877-million package of military drug-fighting  initiatives, said Friday it plans to erect an "aerostat fence" along the  southern border and increase the total steaming, training and flying hours  dedicated to halting the flow of drugs.  </P> <P> Pentagon officials said that, as of Jan. 1, more ships, aircraft and military  personnel got their marching orders to join the war on drugs, reversing years  of military reluctance to participate in what the Pentagon's drug chief once  called "the President's crusade."  </P> <P> Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, in a statement released by the Pentagon, said:  "We will act swiftly, methodically and in accordance with our nation's laws and  traditions" to take part in the coordinated anti-drug campaign initiated by  President Bush.  </P> <P> Defense officials were quick to note that, even though the Pentagon clearly is  expanding its participation in the drug war, the military's role in the  campaign will be subject to strict limits.  </P> <P> For instance, National Guardsmen and active-duty soldiers, accompanied by  military drug-sniffing dogs, will help U.S. Customs Service agents inspect  cargo for drugs under the Pentagon proposal. But the military personnel will  focus on surveillance, passing information to U.S. and foreign law enforcement  authorities who would perform actual arrests.  </P> <P> Although the new strategy does not assign any new anti-drug missions to the  Defense Department, Pentagon officials said it represents a significant  commitment of additional resources to the effort.  </P> <P> "It is more of the same, but it is substantially more of the same," said  Stephen M. Duncan, the Pentagon's drug czar.  </P> <P> Duncan warned, however, that U.S. efforts would take a long time to bear fruit  and said the effectiveness of the military's participation could not be  measured by increased arrests or drug seizures.  </P> <P> While some in Congress have long urged an increased military role in the  anti-drug war, critics have complained that military operations are costly and  less effective than civilian education, treatment and interdiction efforts.  </P> <P> The Pentagon's plans also increased concerns among some lawmakers and public  interest groups that the military's expanded role could further erode the legal  doctrine that bars servicemen and servicewomen from participating in law  enforcement functions.  </P> <P> "I greatly fear for our civil liberties as the traditional separation between  the civilian and the military is further breached," said Rep. Don Edwards  (D-San Jose), who characterized the military expansion as "enormous" and "very  shocking."  </P> <P> The armed services plan to step up their provision of intelligence,  communications and logistics support, as well as interdiction training, to  local drug-fighting efforts in the cocaine-producing countries of Colombia,  Peru and Bolivia.  </P> <P> Defense officials said, for instance, that special U.S. military teams will  help train and equip Colombian, Peruvian and Bolivian forces to conduct  operations along South America's vast river networks.  </P> <P> In the Caribbean Sea, four to five ships will ply the heavily trafficked area  daily in search of drug runners, an operational increase of about 80%. Flight  hours by U.S. surveillance aircraft will rise by 220% this year over 1989's  level, Duncan said.  </P> <P> In the Pacific, U.S. naval forces that previously played a minor role in  gathering drug-related intelligence will see a "dramatic increase" in their  efforts, the Pentagon said.  </P> <P> Navy ships operating out of Pacific Command ports will devote the equivalent of  867 days of patrol to waters close to Asian nations and nearer to the United  States in search of drug traffickers. That would represent a 146% increase in  the Pacific drug-fighting efforts by surface ships. Navy warplanes would  increase drug-related patrols by 24%.  </P> <P> American military forces already have broken new ground by joining in efforts  to eradicate marijuana fields on federal lands in the Hawaiian Islands. Under  the Pentagon plan, active-duty forces and National Guardsmen would conduct  similar operations over state lands if requested.  </P> <P> The military's "aerostat fence" -- 15 sensor-laden balloons and blimps strung  across the southern U.S. border -- would be completed by 1992, defense  officials said. Their gaze would be supplemented by 44 ground-based radar  installations along the border.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, about 50 American interceptor aircraft would remain on alert to  "scramble" toward potential drug traffickers and monitor their approach to U.S.  territory.  </P> <P> Col. Lawrence Izzo, a military planner for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that  while U.S. warplanes would not be able to open fire on suspected drug  traffickers, they would operate under guidelines that permit them to defend  themselves if fired on.  </P> <P> Duncan said that Cheney has agreed to begin a cooperative study by the Defense  Department and the Justice Department's Bureau of Prisons to investigate how  Defense Department facilities could be used to house overflow prisoners.  </P> <P> In a proposal expected to bring an expanded military presence to Long Beach,  Duncan said that the Pentagon will establish four new regional logistics  support offices around the nation -- slated for New York, Florida, California  and Texas.  </P> <P> While officials have not identified the sites, a Defense Department source said  that Long Beach appears to be the principal location under consideration in  California.  </P></p>

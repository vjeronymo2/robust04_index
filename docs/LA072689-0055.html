			<p><P> July 26, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: PAINT DOESN'T CURB HIS  </P> <P> Desire for Publicity  </P> <P> Roger Boesky, a commercial real estate developer, doesn't believe in asking the  government for favors.  </P> <P> Rather than plead with City Hall to redress the parking problems outside his  SeaCoast Square shopping center, at Garnet Avenue and Mission Boulevard in  Pacific Beach, Boesky did it himself.  </P> <P> He ordered the curb along Garnet painted white. White designates a passenger  loading zone, where parking is limited to three minutes, which would discourage  all-day beach-goers from tying up the spots.  </P> <P> Every little bit helps, Boesky figured.  </P> <P> Finding a parking space in Pacific Beach, particularly one near Crystal Pier,  is about as easy as finding a beachfront home in La Jolla for $75,000.  </P> <P> Boesky notified the city of his work. He insists the curb was white when he  bought the building in 1983, but the color had since faded.  </P> <P> The Engineering and Development Department could find no record of ever  authorizing that side of Garnet and Mission as a white zone. It sent an  inspector to inspect. It sent a letter to Boesky.  </P> <P> "We try to discourage free-lance curb painting," said supervisor Craig  Tennesen. Among other things, it confuses the meter maids.  </P> <P> Still, the city takes a patient, almost parental, attitude toward people who  paint their own curbs. Often, the city ends up painting the curb the same  color.  </P> <P> One solution, said city traffic engineer Massoud Sammak, would be to paint two  spaces white and sandblast the two others back to their native gray. If so,  Boesky will be billed $100.  </P> <P> Boesky, a second cousin to fallen financier Ivan Boesky, can live with that. He  gets half a loaf of parking and something even more precious: publicity.  </P> <P> "Do you have any idea how hard it is to get some public relations for a  shopping center?" he asked. "I have another building in Del Mar. If I paint the  curb there, can I get a story out of that, too?"  </P> <P> Sorry, I'm checking out the red-zone artists of Clairemont.  </P> <P> </P> <P> As the Worm Turns  </P> <P> If you have a lemon, make lemonade. And if you have earthworm castings, make  fertilizer.  </P> <P> The Fallbrook Sanitary District wants to make a buck from the droppings left by  the worms that nibble at sludge created during waste-water treatment. But first  it needs a catchy name.  </P> <P> So it held a contest and attracted 150 entries. Four persons submitted the same  name and will now split 3 cubic yards of fertilizer.  </P> <P> The winning name: Fallbrook Vermigro. That's vermi (worms) and gro  (fertilizer).  </P> <P> Among the losing entries: Vertigro, Castings of Thousands, Vermix, Vermiverde,  Vermade, Wormade, Sludge Fudge, Fertilverm, Brown Poopon and more.  </P> <P> "A few others were descriptive but perhaps a bit inappropriate," General  Manager Ben Price said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Windows Into History  </P> <P> Update: Arnold Hunsberger is willing to help the new owners of the El Cortez  Hotel in downtown San Diego rehabilitate the outside glass elevator.  </P> <P> For unknown reasons, it had lapsed into local legend that the elevator, the  first such in the country, had been built by a now-defunct German firm.  </P> <P> That's what the owners told the city's Historical Site Board in explaining why  plans to renovate and reopen the 61-year-old landmark did not include fixing up  the elevator.  </P> <P> The truth, said Hunsberger, is that the elevator was built in 1955 by a San  Diego firm called Elevator Electric that he owned with two partners. The three  went on to build 1,000 glass elevators.  </P> <P> The Historical Site Board, which is reluctant to approve the renovation unless  the elevator is included, is set to discuss the Cortez again in August.  </P> <P> Representatives of hotelier Mark Grosvenor are interested in talking to  Hunsberger, now 62 and semi-retired.  </P> <P> All he's doing these days is building a glass-and-steel home in Dulzura,  complete with co-generation plant, and working as the hands-on president of  Tech-Matic of San Diego, involved in robotics and computerization of machine  tooling.  </P></p>

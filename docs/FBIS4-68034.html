			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Lima, 28 Apr (EFE) -- [passage omitted] The  opposition newspaper LA REPUBLICA today published a police  report that confirms the [Shining Path] group's split. The  newspaper reports that the faction opposing [Shining Path  leader] Guzman held a meeting in March in the Huanta Province  mountains in southern Peru. During the meeting this faction  agreed to disregard Guzman's peace proposal.    The report also indicates that during this meeting a new  Shining Path "central committee" was formed, and that this  "central committee" expelled from the party the leaders who  remain loyal to Guzman and who support peace, describing them as  "traitors, infiltrated people, capitulators, and old  revisionists."    According to the report the new "committee" is headed by  Shining Path leader Oscar Ramirez Durand, alias "Comrade  Feliciano," one of the Shining Path founders.    Former Deputy Carlos Tapia, another expert in Shining Path  activities, stressed today that "Shining Path no longer  represents a threat, and in a way we may coexist with this type  of violence as is the case with the IRA [Irish Republican Army]  in Ireland and the ETA [Basque Homeland and Liberty] in Spain."    Nevertheless, Tapia ruled out the possibility of the  terrorist organization's immediate disappearance, "as the social  processes that have been brewing for so long may not end  overnight, and some time is required for their extinction."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 16 KYODO -- Vietnam wants to join  international mechanisms in the Asia-Pacific region, Vietnamese  Deputy Foreign Minister Vu Khoan said here Thursday [16 June].    In a 20-minute meeting with Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa,  Vu Khoan thanked Japan for calling on the Organization for  Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to expand its  assistance to Indochina countries, including Vietnam, at last  week's OECD meeting in Paris, foreign ministry officials said.    Vu Khoan was quoted as telling Kakizawa that Vietnam is  making preparations to join the Association of Southeast Asian  Nations (ASEAN).    He did not specify any other Asia-Pacific groupings Vietnam  is interested in joining, but Hanoi has expressed willingness to  participate in the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (PECC)  and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in the  future, according to the officials.    Kakizawa replied that Japan wants to help Vietnam take  active  part in the Asia-Pacific region and will continue to make  efforts to expand OECD assistance to the region, the officials  said.    Turning to Vietnam's diplomatic relations, Vu Khoan told  Kakizawa that ties with the United States are improving, with  the two sides recently agreeing to set up liaison offices in  each other's country.    Vietnam's relations with China are also improving, although  some problems remain, and Hanoi wants to solve those problems  through negotiations, Vu Khoan was quoted as saying.    Negotiations over several disputed land and sea boundaries,  including the row over the Spratly Islands, have been under way  since Vietnam and China reestablished diplomatic relations in  1991, but have failed to make much progress.    Kakizawa welcomed Vietnam's recent economic and social  developments and told Vu Khoan he hopes Hanoi will continue  making efforts to normalize relations with China and the U.S.,  the officials said.    Kakizawa and Vu Khoan agreed to cooperate in implementing  Japan's economic cooperation with Vietnam, they said.</p>

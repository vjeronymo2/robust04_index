			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Remarks by Libyan leader Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi at ceremony </F> presenting award to Chadian President Idriss Deby in Tripoli on  4 June]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Since when has France defended  freedom in Africa? France is a mortal enemy to the African  peoples. It is the power that colonized and destroyed it,  exploited its wealth, and despised its people. It is still  spreading its domination over Africa by military force, and has  not recognized the independence of the African states, including  Chad. It considers them its colonies and works toward creating  an international status before the United States and in Europe  via its domination of the African continent. It has created for  that purpose the traditional annual Francophone summit. This  imperialist policy is exposed and condemned by the African  peoples. What justification does France have to keep its forces  in Chad after the end of the border dispute between Libya and  Chad? It used to claim that there was an occupied Chadian  territory and that there was a border dispute to keep its  military forces to defend Chad. What will France say after this  dispute comes to an end? How will it justify its presence in  Chad after today? Certainly, there is no justification, except  that it wants to occupy Chadian territory and wants Chad to  remain its colony; otherwise it should go back to where it came  from. [passage omitted]</p>

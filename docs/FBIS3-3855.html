Mr Huang, who was attending the National People's Congress  meeting, said there was "nothing to discuss" with Britain which  was adopting an "unco-operative" attitude with China over  political development in Hong Kong.    His comment, different in tone to Chinese Foreign Minister  Qian Qichen, cast doubt on projects to ease traffic congestion  between China and Hong Kong.    Mr Qian had pledged that China was willing to cooperate with  Britain on issues outside politics.    The Shenzhen government has been discussing with Hong Kong  the 24-hour opening of the Lok Ma Chau checkpoint.    But Mr Huang said that although there were a few projects in  the pipeline, discussions would not be started at present,  apparently referring to the construction of a Shenzhen-Hong Kong  highway.</p>

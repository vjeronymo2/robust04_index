			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Labour condemns training underspend A GOVERNMENT budget to provide Employment Training places for the long-term adult unemployed in England and Wales for this financial year was underspent by Pounds 70m in November, according to a leaked Department of Employment document. Some of the money, which amounts to nearly 10 per cent of the annual budget of Pounds 802m, is to be used to meet overspending on other training schemes, including Youth Training. The Labour party claimed the underspend showed that the government's training schemes were in a state of chaos. Mr Tony Blair, Labour employment spokesman, accused the government of raiding the ET budget to cover its guarantee to young people of a place on Youth Training. He said one reason for the ET underspend was that unit costs, the amount provided to train each participant, had been held down. That had reduced the number of employers wishing to take part. The Department of Employment said that it was normal practice for government departments to switch money from one budget to another. Spending of money earmarked for ET was a matter for Training and Enterprise Councils and there was a variety of reasons why the full budget had not been spent, it said. It was possible that Tecs had been particularly cautious on spending in the early part of the year because they wanted to meet demand later. None the less, the full year is likely to show a significant underspend and the deparment said that adjustments to training budgets would be made in the spring. Separately, the Labour party issued an analysis showing that the proportion of YT leavers entering a full-time job fell from 64 per cent in 1989-90 to 53 per cent in 1990-91. The proportion of trainees obtaining a qualification dropped from 43 to 38 per cent. Mr Henry McLeish, shadow employment minister, said that the analysis, which is based on Department of Employment statistics, showed that YT was inadequate and should be replaced.</p>

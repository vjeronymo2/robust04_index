			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / British Gas agrees to cut market share in OFT deal BRITISH GAS has agreed with the Office of Fair Trading to auction part of its gas supply in order to halve its share of the industrial gas market in the next three years. Based on last year's after-tax profits of Pounds 1.16bn, the move could cost British Gas between Pounds 140m and Pounds 150m a year. The company has also completed plans to put its pipeline and storage system into a separate subsidiary as part of a package of undertakings which aims to encourage competition in UK gas supply. But the deal, which will be announced today, is viewed with scepticism by Ofgas, the industry regulator. Sir James McKinnon, director-general of Ofgas, is expected to distance himself from the final undertakings, though he will want to maintain pressure on the OFT to ensure that British Gas does not try to increase prices to compensate for lost business. The agreement forces British Gas to cut its share of the industrial market to 50 per cent or 3,000m therms, whichever is smaller, by 1994. The company will be required to cut its market share a further 10 per cent in 1995. The OFT is believed to be exerting behind-the-scenes pressure on British Gas not to raise prices as it loses market share, but instead to turn away customers for whom it has no gas. This, however, brings it into conflict with Ofgas, which says British Gas must meet any reasonable request for gas. Today's deal was reached after the OFT threatened a month ago to refer British Gas to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The agreement was patched together after the intervention of Mr John Wakeham, energy secretary, who was anxious to avoid a public row before the general election. Sir James is believed to have favoured a reference to the MMC as a way of forcing the debate out into the open. But he has softened his initial opposition to the deal and now believes it is the best that can be achieved in such a short time. The deal calls on British Gas to sell 500m therms of its gas to competitors in October, for which the company will be able to charge an average wholesale price as well as a handling fee. Details of the auction will be available by the end of April. After that, the OFT will monitor supply and demand in the market to determine how much gas British Gas must auction each year to reduce its market share. As part of the agreement, the gas must go to competitors supplying the general industrial market and not to the power generation sector where demand is growing. In addition, British Gas has agreed to begin operating its huge transmission and storage division as a separate unit within the company from October. The unit will begin publishing separate accounts for the subsidiary for 1993. Ofgas will regulate the pipeline division under new legislation that will be published as part of the Utilities Bill.</p>

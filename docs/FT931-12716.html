			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Indian insurer in joint venture - British seek financial business SUN LIFE Assurance, the UK life company, is planning a joint venture in India to market unit-linked life assurance - the first move into the Indian life industry by a foreign company in recent years. The venture is expected to be launched this year in partnership with the Life Insurance Company of India (LIC), the state insurance monopoly. Mr Peter Grant, Sun Life's chairman, won informal approval for the venture this week from the Indian Finance Ministry. He is visiting India as a member of a delegation of senior British businessmen who have accompanied Mr John Major, the prime minister, on an official visit. Life insurance has been a state monopoly in India since the industry was nationalised in the 1960s. LIC has to lend most of its premium income to the government and its managerial freedom is limited. Nevertheless, in line with the Indian government's economic deregulation programme, LIC is being encouraged to develop new products and services. Sun Life plans to take a 20-30 per cent stake in the new venture and to supply expertise in marketing and managing unit-linked schemes, in which insurance is combined with saving. The remaining 70-80 per cent would be held mainly by LIC, possibly with other Indian partners. Mr Major was yesterday the chief guest at celebrations marking India's Republic Day, which passed off with great pomp and without incident. The British prime minister has made promoting British business the main purpose of his trip. Local businessmen urged him to help the Indian government embark on the privatisation of state-owned industries. He is likely to offer UK expertise on selling formerly loss-making nationalised industries when he addresses businessmen in Bombay today. Yeltsin visits India, Page 4</p>

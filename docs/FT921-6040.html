			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / The Long View: Board room botheration WE ARE conditioned to accept corporate absurdities, but it cannot pass without comment that this week large companies such as Barclays Bank and Commercial Union have declared unchanged or even higher dividends in spite of collapses in their profits, and moreover, slumps that cannot be regarded as one-off aberrations. The question of corporate governance in Britain deserves to be raised again. As it happens, in two or three months' time the subject will be aired in depth by the Cadbury Committee of the great and the good. In the meantime, however, I was intrigued by the debate at the National Association of Pension Funds investment conference this week between Sir Owen Green, chairman of BTR, and Mike Sandland, investment chief of Norwich Union. Debates between extremists serve to dramatise issues but not always to illuminate them. In this case we had an aggressive industrialist, happy to speak his mind and stand on his record, and a more defensive institutional investor; Sandland is currently chairman of the Institutional Shareholders' Committee, a Bank of England-backed pressure group of fund managers, and is therefore at the focus of investment politics. It was easy to see what Green wanted: shareholders should leave companies well alone, perhaps however with the protection of better information to improve their investment decisions. The argument sounds more convincing when coming from a successful manager than when given by somebody from, say, British Aerospace or even Polly Peck. Sandland's agenda was rather more hidden. His committee has been issuing recommendations that institutions should start to take their responsibilities as shareholders more seriously, but many fund managers remain apathetic, particularly in relation to votes on routine issues. The ISC has also urged companies to appoint independent non-executive directors, although there is little evidence that they do a lot of good in practice. Just as Green's mission appeared to be to increase, or at any rate preserve, the power of managers, Sandland seemed to be battling to protect the role of institutional investors. But corporate governance deserves to be debated from a broader point of view. That pension fund and life insurance fund managers have got themselves into this position is really quite a recent phenomenon. In the 1950s two-thirds of company shares were directly held by private investors and under a fifth by institutions. Today those proportions are approximately reversed. The difference as far as corporate governance is concerned is that whereas small investors can freely sell the shares of companies they no longer like and can buy others, big fund managers may find themselves locked in. This is partly because the market is not liquid enough to accommodate the selling and buying orders without imposing a big price penalty. It is also because big, semi-permanent shareholders are often expected - rightly or wrongly - to exercise some kind of proprietorship role. This problem flared up in the late 1980s when a wave of hostile takeovers left many company managements feeling exposed and betrayed, and the investment institutions wilted under the barrage of criticism over their 'short-termism', by which was often meant their inability to understand the true long-term worth of companies. As I have said before in this column, such accusations have been in one important respect misplaced. The big distortion of the capital market at that time lay in the behaviour of the banks, not that of the investment institutions. Banks financed acquisitions at ridiculous prices, often twice the stock market value of companies. The cost of this is now emerging in bank financial statements, as in this week's near Pounds 2bn annual bad debt provision by National Westminster. It was quite rational of long-term institutions to take advantage of this mispricing. In another respect, however, the beleaguered companies were justified in pointing up the anomaly that the big institutions had acquired a dominant position on the shareholder registers and were demanding more information and recognition, but were themselves bringing little to the party. Big shareholders were in fact trying to behave just like the little investors they had replaced. People like Mike Sandland are attempting to persuade the men from the Pru, the Pearl and the Widows to behave as though they were responsible proprietors. But their main contribution is in encouraging companies to pay excessive dividends, which is scarcely how proprietors ought to behave. It seems to me that the whole approach is misconceived, and is the consequence of fears in the City of London, not least at the Bank of England, that a power vacuum is developing that will be filled by some other economic or political interest group if the institutional investors fail to wake up. Inevitably the institutional debate is self-centred: it tends to be about shareholders' rights rather than how companies could best be governed. The independent director is promoted as a substitute for the supportive proprietor: fund managers may come and go from the share register but the non-exec representatives will remain. But who are these non-executives, and exactly what are they independent of? The idea of having compensation sub-committees to determine executive pay seems to have been a bit of a disaster in practice, because executives of some companies acting as non-executives in others have simply approved each others' soaring pay deals. And company bosses like Sir Owen Green naturally do not want spies and snoopers in the boardroom but committed supporters, or at any rate people who clearly represent important stakeholders who can contribute something. I have no idea what the Cadbury Committee will say, but I hope it will address the need to broaden the input into company boardrooms and to get the institutions off the hook of voting obligations which they cannot live up to but which they are terrified of losing to other interests. Certainly, British companies do not need boardrooms packed with traditional non-executive directors who advise that dividends should be paid regardless of the trading circumstances.</p>

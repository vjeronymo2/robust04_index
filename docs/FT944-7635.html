			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Milosevic blames Krajina Serbs President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia yesterday put pressure on Serb leaders from Croatia to halt their offensive on a Moslem enclave in neighbouring Bosnia, and even blamed his former proteges for the Nato attack on a Serb-held airfield. Mr Yasushi Akashi, senior UN official in former Yugoslavia, last night met Mr Milosevic and Mr Milan Martic, leader of Krajina, the self-styled Serb state in Croatia. Senior UN civilian and military chiefs were trying to get Mr Milosevic to exert his influence on Mr Martic to stop aiding their kin across the frontier in Bosnia, who are attacking a UN safe area in the north-west, said diplomats. After the talks, Mr Milosevic called on Mr Martic and the Krajina Serbs to 'resist the forces which are trying to drag the region into war at a time when efforts are under way to restore peace in Croatia.' However, Mr Martic and the Krajina Serbs appear more ready to link their destiny with their Bosnian Serb counterparts, rather than adhere to orders from Belgrade or the international community. International mediators, aided by Mr Milosevic, have tried to drive a wedge between Serbs from Krajina and Bosnia. Politika, the Serbian daily newspaper which is a mouthpiece for Mr Milosevic, yesterday lashed out at Krajina leaders for provoking the Nato attack on Udbina airfield, which was used to launch several air raids on the nearby Bihac enclave. 'The leaderships of the Bosnian and Krajina Serbs must understand that they cannot, by provoking air strikes, change Belgrade's and Yugoslavia's peace policy,' said Mr Hadzi-Dragan Antic, editor of Politika. 'Advocates of the war option are again trying to spread the flame of civil war on the territory of former Yugoslavia,' wrote Mr Antic. But yesterday's commentary in Politika contrasted sharply to a statement from the Yugoslav federal government which is also under Mr Milosevic's control. It denounced as 'unprovoked' and 'irresponsible' the Nato action, which could lead to an escalation of the war. These mixed reactions indicate that Mr Milosevic must send different, and contradictory signals, to constituents in Serbia and abroad. This reflects that he has little room for manoeuvre - under pressure from within his ruling elite, on one hand, and on the other, faced with a deteriorating economy, he is anxious to get UN sanctions lifted. Furious with Bosnian Serb refusal to obey Belgrade and endorse an international peace plan, which would ease UN sanctions, Mr Milosevic in August abandoned his Bosnian Serb proxies.</p>

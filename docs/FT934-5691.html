			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Survey of Denmark (5): A rare change of command - Profile / A. P. Moller, Denmark's top company, has a new boss AP Moller, the discreetly-run, strangely-structured shipping group that is Denmark's biggest business concern, has this year undergone a change in chief executive for only the second time in its near 90 year history. On the eve of his 80th birthday in July, Mr Maersk Mc-Kinney Moller stepped aside from the day-to-day running of the group founded in 1904 and headed until the 1960s by his father, the late Mr AP Moller. Into his shoes stepped Mr Jess Soderberg, 49, who assumed the task of leading an enterprise with total annual turnover of some DKr50bn across a range of businesses spanning shipping, shipbuilding, oil and gas, air transport and retailing. But although the chief executive is no longer a member of the controlling family, few people inside or outside the Moller empire expect dramatic shifts to follow the change at the top. 'Although the skipper has changed, there has been no change in the crew and we remain on the same heading,' said a Moller executive unable to resist a seafaring metaphor. Indeed, Mr Mc-Kinney Moller has not left the scene. He remains chairman of the group's twin parent companies D/S Svendborg and D/S 1912 (both controlled by the Moller family) and the boards of key companies within the group. 'I will stay informed  .. I will often be in this building, although in another office,' he told staff at Moller's Copenhagen headquarters when he handed over to Mr Soderberg. Analysts in Copenhagen seem reassured by Mr Mc-Kinney Moller's move, anticipating a smooth transition under Mr Soderberg, formerly chief financial officer. Furthermore, a reputation for being well managed has helped deflect investor concern over the complex and arcane structure of the Moller group, and its reluctance to speak publicly about its business. Although the parent companies, with a market value of some DKr40bn, together make up about one quarter of the market capitalisation of the Copenhagen stock exchange, the AP Moller group, with 30,000 employees, does not publish consolidated accounts. This is because of its structure under which AP Moller itself is an unlisted partnership. The parent companies have kept to a minimum the information they must publish by avoiding share issues which would require a detailed prospectus. In the 89-year history of the group, the only issue by the parent companies was a bonus issue in 1973. But there is no arguing with the share performance. They have surged by some 50 per cent this year, with D/S Svendborg B shares fetching a cool DKr170,000 each. The market's judgment is clearly that AP Moller's businesses are, in the words of an analyst, 'in good health'. This is despite a nasty slide in profits in 1992 in the shipping business. The dominant Tankers and Liners in Partnership unit saw net profits tumble to DKr1.05bn from DKr1.5bn, on slightly reduced turnover of DKr19.5bn - and the figures were worse after transfers from the parent companies were excluded. Analysts put most of this down to weakness in the worldwide shipping market. They believe Moller's evolution over the past 15 years into the world's leading container carrier will pay off when the cycle turns up again. Moller has continued to invest heavily throughout the recession, this year ordering five ships from its own Odense Steel Shipyard capable of carrying 4,800 standard 20-ft containers. It has established a number of 'hub' container terminals around the world allowing it to develop an integrated north-south and east-west route network with extensive onshore services, including container trains in the US and Europe. Moller has also recently returned to building and operating VLCC (very large crude carrier) oil tankers. It has ordered six 300,000-tonne double-hulled tankers, three of which have already been built, from Odense. These were the first of their type to be built in the world as Moller seeks to cash in on new marine regulations on 'environmentally-friendly' tankers that are designed to be resistant to puncture. However, the element in AP Moller which increasingly underpins group profitability is the oil and gas division, which last year produced profits of DKr808m on turnover of DKr3.3bn. The group has a 39 per cent share in Danish Underground Consortium, the sole operator of Denmark's North Sea oil and gas. This year DUC signed a contract with the state to double gas deliveries to 7bn cubic metres a year from 1997. 'Forty per cent of Moller profits will come from oil and gas in the long term,' said a Copenhagen analyst. 'That is the cash cow.'</p>

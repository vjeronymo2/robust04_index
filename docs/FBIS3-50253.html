			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with economic experts of the Hungarian Socialist </F> Party, the Alliance of Free Democrats, and the Hungarian  Democratic Forum, by Henrik Hammang and Sara Szeli; place and  date not given: "Party Views on Key Economic Issues -- The Owner  Is the Main Actor"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted]  <H3>  Laszlo Pal: The MSZP Does  Not Promise Immediate Prosperity </H3>   [PESTI HIRLAP] If the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] gets  into a government position, what possibilities do you see of  preserving the value of welfare spending and pensions?    [Pal] In the coming period, our party is preparing for  crisis management, because the decreased gross national product,  the negative processes in foreign trade and agriculture, the  very high deficit of the balance of payments, and the domestic  budget deficit all point to a very difficult next period,  whoever is in government. In our view, it is at the end of 1995  or the beginning of 1996 when a stable situation can turn into  an economic upswing, providing that we have a balancing economic  policy. I am talking about balancing because, all at the same  time, we have to ensure that inflation does not suddenly  increase, the balance of payments does not get into a much worse  situation, social tensions do not increase more than bearable,  and unemployment does not again start to increase, while the  country becomes competitive thus ensuring economic growth.    Naturally, in the current situation, without any basis, the  MSZP cannot promise higher welfare spending or an immediate  improvement in living standards. We feel that the essence of  our politics manifests itself in the fact that we want to  establish a much more equitable process in the distribution of  the social product. Even in this period of crisis management,  we must restrain the polarization of the population, the  extremely rapid impoverishment of certain strata of society, and  the increasing uncertainty of the middle classes. We have said,  many times, that the reform of state administration cannot be  delayed.

[Soos] The SZDSZ's economic program, in which we seek  answers to important social policy questions, has been drawn up,  but the National Council has not yet discussed it. Regarding  pensions, two major problems have to be taken into  consideration. The first is handling the position of  pensioners. In our view, we must adhere strictly to the  provision in the law that prescribes that pensions have to be  adjusted to the average wages. As for the future of the pension  system, a general minimum has to be ensured that facilitates  decent living standards for elderly people. People who do not  receive enough for this from the social security fund will have  to have their monthly income supplemented from the state budget.  [passage omitted]    [PESTI HIRLAP] Would the SZDSZ increase or decrease the  amount of tax payable if it changes the tax system?    [Soos] As an option, we want to introduce the lump sum tax  in retail trade and services that functioned well in the past.  This would reduce administration. It makes the speculation of  expenses unnecessary. According to our surveys, this form of  taxation is very popular with the entrepreneurs. This would  retrieve the tax lost through abolishing the minimum tax in a  way that is voluntarily chosen. Therefore, our proposal to  reduce taxes also takes the not- too-rosy budget situation into  consideration. [passage omitted]  <H5>  Gyula Takacsy: The Future Belongs to Private Ownership </H5>   [PESTI HIRLAP] The Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] is the  biggest party of the current government coalition. Which tax  laws would you change after the 1994 elections?    [Takacsy] Hungary is in the process of major changes. In  1988, a new tax system was drawn up that resulted in a  tremendously increased number of enterprises, together with  incomes from the gray and black economies, which are not taxed.  These have to be terminated. A very long time is needed for us  to reach the level of stability that exists in Germany for  example, where tax discipline and control are highly developed.  When this is achieved, we can start thinking about abolishing  the minimum tax, which is a necessary evil in the current  situation. Realistically, we can think about a slow lowering of  taxes and making taxation more balanced. We can mainly expect  the reduction of company tax, which is a revenue type tax. I  cannot foresee the reduction of taxes linked to turnover.  [passage omitted] Naturally, it is a very important part of  our program that we do not plan radical tax decreases, rather,  we say that balance can basically be restored through launching  growth. [passage omitted]    [PESTI HIRLAP] To what extent would you be able to reduce  the country's foreign debts in the coming four years?    [Takacsy] I do not think that this is our most important  task; at the moment, the Hungarian economy is in a situation in  which it has to draw on foreign resources because we have too  little capital, which is necessary for development. In my view,  the debt has to be managed rather than reduced, which  essentially means that the repayment of capital amounts can be  resolved through taking on new loans, which, in a favorable  case, changes the structure of loans, namely turns into  longer-term loans, and the interest payments will have to be  born out of the Hungarian economy's current balance of payments.  In my view, this is not our primary task, because there are  very many indebted countries in the world, including the United  States. [passage omitted]</p>

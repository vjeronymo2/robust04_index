			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On 6 March Yasir 'Arafat, leader of the Palestine  Liberation Organization, arrived in Cairo to discuss the latest  developments regarding the Hebron massacre as well as the  situation in the occupied land with the head of the Egyptian  regime Husni Mubarak.    The 'Arafat-Mubarak talks are taking place under  circumstances when the head of the Egyptian regime, in contacts  in the past few days with American and Israeli officials, has  endeavored to reduce the current crisis in the Arab-Israeli  dispute following the onslaught against worshipers in Hebron.  The PLO has also dispatched envoys to Washington. The PLO has  subjected the resumption of peace talks with Israel to the  presence of international force in the occupied areas to protect  the lives of Palestinians, to disarm the Jews in the region and  to destroy some of the Jewish populated townships in Gaza and  West Bank of Jordan river. The Zionist regime, meanwhile, has  rejected as a precondition the presence of international force  in the occupied lands to secure safety for Palestinians.  Yitzhak Rabin has agreed to hold talks about presence of these  forces in the occupied areas in the next round provided they are  not military forces. To this end, yesterday, Norway said that  it would dispatch forces to the usurped lands within an  international force.    Political experts believe the presence of an international  force in the occupied lands cannot serve favorable to the  Zionist regime in light of the fact that the issue of Palestine  and Israel will spread from the region to a vaster level and the  Zionist regime will not welcome its consequences. However, it  seems that in view of the pressure Israel feels at the moment  from the public opinion, the plan on dispatch of international  force to the occupied areas is brought about and pursued this  time by the West and America with objectives in an entity which  contradicts the ideals of Palestinians, and aims to reduce  pressures exerted on Israel. Therefore, in the light of  reflection of the Hebron massacre and the sensitive public  opinion towards the crime, the Zionist regime has been placed in  defensive position; and what is tangible in the midst is the  efforts the West and America make to rid the Zionists of the  current unfavorable situation. These efforts, once again,  indicate the dual policy of the United States vis-a-vis the  issues related to Israel and Arabs.</p>

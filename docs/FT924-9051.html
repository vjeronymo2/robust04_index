			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / International Company News: Woolworth eyes German disposal WOOLWORTH, the US retailer, announced yesterday that it was considering selling much of its important German operations, comprising more than 500 stores with annual turnover of more than Dollars 1.6bn. The potential disposal does not include the company's expanding Foot Locker business, selling athletic shoes, which it is building up as a major chain across Europe. Woolworth has had a significant presence in Germany for decades and the country provides about one sixth of the group's total sales of Dollars 10bn. Profits boomed following the reunification, with revenues leaping from Dollars 1.18bn in 1989 to Dollars 1.66bn in 1990 and operating profits soaring from Dollars 80m to Dollars 154m. However, in 1991 profits slipped to Dollars 127m on revenues little changed. The company said yesterday it was exploring various alternatives for its general merchandise and specialty stores in Germany, including the possible disposal of some or all of the operations to one or more third parties. A spokeswoman would only say the company had the enhancement of shareholder value as one of its strategic objectives. Analysts said the disposal would free funds and allow Woolworth to concentrate on its European strategy for Foot Locker, which is now the company's most important single business in the US. The company has 134 Foot Locker stores in seven European countries, including 27 outlets in Germany, and wants to increase that to 1,000 outlets by the year 2000. German operations which could be sold comprise more than 320 Woolworth general stores and more than 180 specialty stores, including Rubin costume jewellery, handbags and accessory shops; Moderna and Der Schuh shoe stores; and Lady Plus clothes stores for larger-sized women. The company is being advised by US investment banks Merrill Lynch and Salomon Brothers. Woolworth shares rose Dollars  3/8 on the news to close at Dollars 33 7/8 on the New York Stock Exchange. Earlier this week Woolworth reported sharply improved third-quarter results, with after-tax profits rising to Dollars 65m from Dollars 41m a year ago. Sales rose 2.5 per cent to Dollars 2.5bn. However, the company has disappointed Wall Street over the past two years as Foot Locker in the US has grown into a mature business, while its two other big American divisions - the Woolworth general merchandise chain and Kinney family shoe - have been shrinking.</p>

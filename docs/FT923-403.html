			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Bush vetoes MFN terms over China PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday vetoed a bill that would have imposed conditions for granting most-favoured-nation (MFN) trade status to China, AP reports from Washington. In a statement, Mr Bush said he shared Congress' desire to promote progress on human rights and restrict weapons sales. However, the measure 'would not lead to faster progress in advancing our goals'. The president rejected a similar bill earlier this year.</p>

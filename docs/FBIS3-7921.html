			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] The documents which have just been drafted at the  State Department contain, among other things, the following:  The text of an outline agreement on a federation and the  division of powers among the cantons and the central goverment  [in Bosnia-Herzegovina]]; the text of a preliminary agreement on  the principles and foundations of the confederation of the  Republic of Croatia and the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation; and  the document on a transit agreement between Croatia and the  federation. While I am filing this report, the two delegations  and their hosts are holding talks.    A document has also been drafted on the founding of  high-level committees which, between 4 and 15 March, most  probably in Vienna, will analyze, prepare, and formulate a draft  constitution for Bosnia-Herzegovina, as well as a preliminary  agreement between Croatia and the federation, an agreement on  military arrangements within the federation, and on interim  measures and government bodies. The committee will coordinate  the implementation of the outline agreement on the federation.    A document on protection of human rights has also been  drafted, containing reference to a series of conventions and  declarations on protection of human rights, minorities etc.    Foreign Minister Granic was received in Washington this  morning by U.S. Vice President Al Gore. The talks were also  attended by Ambassadors Redman, Sarcevic, and Galbraith. The  Muslim-Croat agreement and possible solutions for the crisis in  the Balkans were discussed.    Both sides want, in principle, to reach an agreement. The  solution is to be found at a diplomatic level in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, Gore said. An outline has already been  provided by NATO and the United Nations, whose decisions we have  to implement, the U.S. vice president told reporters. He added  that NATO and UN decisions have improved chances of success in  the diplomatic field. It has been demonstrated that this yields  success, Al Gore said.    We will try today to sign the preliminary agreement on a  federation between the Croats and Muslims and on a confederation  between the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation and Croatia, Granic  told reporters at the White House. We are now in the final  stage of the negotiations and let us wait and see what happens,  Granic said.    Al Gore spoke about U.S. aid to Croatia in the following  spheres: Help will be provided in the peaceful reintegration of  UN protected areas; some commentators have been talking about  credits to the tune of $500 million. The Partnership for Peace  has also been mentioned. International financial institutions  will approach Croatia once the agreement is signed, which is  expected to be done on 15 March at top level, and then endorsed  by the Croatian Assembly.

			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOKYO STOCKS FALL, YEN BOUNCES AS OIL CUSTOMER REACTS  </P> <P> Tokyo stocks plummeted in early afternoon trading today and the yen fluctuated  wildly against the dollar as Japan monitored news of an Iraqi invasion of  Kuwait.  </P> <P> Japan is hugely dependent on Persian Gulf oil supplies and a Foreign Ministry  official said of the attack: "We deeply regret (the development) because it  involves military actions.  </P> <P> "The conflict, if further aggravated and prolonged, would have significant  impact on Japan in various forms, especially in terms of oil supplies."  </P> <P> On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the key Nikkei index -- which had fallen 255  points in the morning session, partly over gulf tensions -- plunged almost  another 400 points in the first 25 minutes of afternoon trading.  </P> <P> It stood at 30,199.64, just over 638 points down on the day or 2.07%.  </P> <P> Tokyo currency dealers were also anxiously watching gulf developments with news  of the fighting between the two oil producers boosting the dollar by nearly a  yen.  </P> <P> "It was incredible. The market was thin, but it just went wild," said Yuko  Fukakusa, assistant manager at Tokai Bank. "The dollar's safe-haven status is  still alive and well."  </P> <P> The dollar fluctuated violently between its morning low of 146.50 yen and high  of 148.15, reached after frenzied buying after a Japanese translation of the  news appeared.  </P> <P> The dollar was at 147.70 yen at midday.  </P> <P> Yen-denominated gold futures rose sharply.  </P></p>

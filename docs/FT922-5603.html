			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Wholesale power prices fall WHOLESALE electricity prices have fallen for the first time since privatisation, according to a report by Caminus Energy, the Cambridge consultancy which studies the pool - the wholesale electricity market. Prices were down by 16 per cent in the first quarter of this year, at 2.09p a unit, as supply rose and demand steadied. Prices over the full year to March varied, though, with the unit price reaching a peak of 376p and falling as low as 0.5p, Caminus said. The average price was 2.24p, an increase of 22 per cent over the previous year, which was the first year of the pool's operation. Caminus said the main reason for this was that power stations closed, pushing up the part of the price that reflects supply and demand. Caminus remained neutral on the row over whether the pool price was too high or too low. It said both consumers, who have faced big rises, and generators, who argue that the price is too low to cover costs, have valid points. The new market in electricity had been criticised, Caminus said, but it had never been intended to give stable prices. It was not supposed to give the generators a guaranteed return on new investments.</p>

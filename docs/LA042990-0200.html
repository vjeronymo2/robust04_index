			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEXICO TO SEEK WARRANTS IN SUSPECT'S KIDNAPING  </P> <P> The Mexican government said late Saturday that it would seek the extradition of  Americans and Mexican citizens in the United States who "executed, planned or  organized" the kidnaping of a Guadalajara doctor accused in the 1985 murder of  a U.S. drug agent.  </P> <P> The bulletin from the Mexican Foreign Ministry did not say how many people the  government sought, nor did it identify them. But on Friday, Mexico's attorney  general had said he would issue an arrest warrant for Antonio Garate  Bustamante, a Los Angeles-based Drug Enforcement Administration operative who  has admitted to arranging the abduction.  </P> <P> Garate, a former Mexican police officer, told The Times in an interview last  week that he arranged to have Dr. Humberto Alvarez Machain abducted in  Guadalajara on April 2 and delivered the following day to Los Angeles-based DEA  agents waiting in El Paso, Texas.  </P> <P> Garate asserted that the clandestine operation, dubbed "Wild Geese," was  approved by DEA agent Hector Berellez. Berellez heads Operation Leyenda, the  investigation into the torture and murder of drug agent Enrique S. Camarena in  Guadalajara.  </P> <P> "The Mexican government will immediately initiate proceedings to request the  extradition of the people, be they nationals or foreigners, who have  participated in the execution, planning or organization of the kidnaping," the  bulletin said.  </P> <P> Mexican Atty. Gen. Enrique Alvarez del Castillo has not placed blame for the  kidnaping on the DEA. It is not clear whether Mexico would request the  extradition of any DEA officials.  </P> <P> The Foreign Ministry bulletin says that further cooperation between Mexico and  the DEA will continue "only insofar as an agreement can be reached on new rules  of cooperation and exchange of information . . . " and that the number of DEA  agents in Mexico will be "limited."  </P> <P> It states that the Mexican government has not received a response to its April  17 diplomatic note delivered in Washington requesting clarification of the  Alvarez case.  </P> <P> Mexican federal police have arrested six people in connection with the  kidnaping, including two Guanajuato state police officers and a former federal  police commander.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HE WANTS TO BE LEADER OF THE SACK;  </P> <P> COLLEGE FOOTBALL: EX-LONG BEACH POLY STANDOUT MARK ODOM CLOSES IN ON THE  UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII'S RECORD FOR QUARTERBACK SNUFFS. HE'S SIX SHY OF THE MARK.  </P> <P> Mark Odom hasn't done the hula yet. But don't count it out.  </P> <P> Since 1987, when the Carson native arrived here to play outside linebacker for  the University of Hawaii, he has been teaching islanders how to dance,  Odom-style.  </P> <P> Odom's spontaneous sack celebrations have become legendary at Hawaii's Aloha  Stadium.  </P> <P> With 28 career sacks, Odom needs just six more to break the school record held  by Al Noga (now with the Minnesota Vikings).  </P> <P> Hawaiians are hoping Odom will hula over a fallen quarterback after his  record-breaking sack.  </P> <P> "I try to be calm," Odom said. "But I just get carried away. I make a sack and  then I jump up and make a fool of myself. Sometimes I wish I could change my  number or something."  </P> <P> Odom, who says he never sack-danced as a prep standout at Long Beach Poly High  School, has showed islanders an array of moves. But the Rainbow fans have named  a few of their Odom favorites:  </P> <P> * There is The Wrestling Referee, which Odom perfected last season when he  sacked Brigham Young's Ty Detmer, fell to his knees, and thumped the Aloha  Stadium turf with his fists as if Detmer was down for the count.  </P> <P> * One of Odom's most creative dances is The Death Lick, in which Odom makes a  "skull and crossbones" sign with his fingers over the downed quarterback.  </P> <P> * A variation of that is The Mark of Odom, where Odom crosses his forearms.  </P> <P> * And then there is The Dance of Doom, a modified limbo with Odom's arms waving  hysterically over his head for punctuation.  </P> <P> "I make 'em up as I go along," Odom said. "They change from Saturday to  Saturday. I don't know what I'm doing half the time. It's because football is  fun for me. . . . That's the whole reason I play football."  </P> <P> The choreography, Odom said, is not rehearsed.  </P> <P> Hawaii Coach Bob Wagner said: "I've seen a lot of players celebrate their  sacks, but not many with the . . . style that Mark has. He must watch a lot of  big-time wrestling."  </P> <P> It started in Hawaii's first preseason game of 1987, when Odom was a freshman  linebacker who had earned a starting job in a rebuilding defense. Five of the  top six linebackers had graduated from a Hawaii defense that was ranked No. 5  in the nation the previous year.  </P> <P> "We had wanted to redshirt Mark that year," Wagner said, "but he wouldn't let  us. He played too hard."  </P> <P> In the first quarter of that game, Odom blindsided Yale quarterback Kelly Ryan  and dumped him to the turf. Aloha Stadium's crowd of 43,018 roared.  </P> <P> And a dance was born.  </P> <P> "I was so excited to get my first sack," Odom said. "And then it just . . .  happened."  </P> <P> It has been happening since. Odom finished with 11 sacks in 1987, and Hawaii  went 5-7.  </P> <P> In 1988, Odom was shifted to inside linebacker. Asked to stop the run, Odom  recorded just one sack but led the Rainbows with 110 tackles. Hawaii went 9-3.  </P> <P> But it was Odom's junior season that put the happy dancer into the national  spotlight. Odom led the Western Athletic Conference in sacks with 13, was voted  the conference's defensive player of the year by the media and helped Hawaii to  a 9-3-1 record and an Aloha Bowl appearance against Michigan State.  </P> <P> He has three sacks so far this season for the 2-2 Rainbows.  </P> <P> "Mark gets off the ball real well, and he plays extremely hard," Wagner said.  "We like to pressure the quarterback quite a bit here. We send five people at  the quarterback a lot, and Mark is always at the front of it."  </P> <P> Odom set the Hawaii record with four sacks of Detmer -- the favorite to win  this year's Heisman Trophy -- in the Rainbows' 56-14 blowout of Brigham Young  last season. On another play, Odom tackled Detmer and caused him to fumble.  </P> <P> "Detmer isn't a big guy, but pound for pound he's one of the toughest  quarterbacks around," Odom said. "I laid some real hits on him, and every time  he got right back up. On one play, I hit him square and put him on his back,  but he still threw a 20-yard completion."  </P> <P> Hawaii and Brigham Young meet in this season's WAC finale. Odom plans to keep  the pressure on Detmer.  </P> <P> "If you let him sit back there and get comfortable, he'll just take you apart,"  Odom said.  </P> <P> At 5-feet-11, 219 pounds, Odom is a cat-quick linebacker. But some scouts  contend that he lacks the height to play in the National Football League.  </P> <P> "I think Mark has a shot at the NFL," Wagner said. "Obviously, his lack of  height is a liability, but with a guy like him it just might be a matter of  timing and luck."  </P> <P> Odom is expected to graduate with honors in May from Hawaii's School of  Business -- one of the university's most challenging programs. So Odom will  have a degree -- earned in four years -- to fall back on if a career in pro  football fails to materialize.  </P> <P> "Scouts are always hung up on things like height and weight," Odom said. "I'll  just play hard and let things happen. I would say I could play on another  level, but if I don't get my shot, that's fine."  </P> <P> Mark Carrier, a friend and teammate of Odom at Long Beach Poly, is now a safety  for the Chicago Bears after being an all-American at USC. Odom used to watch  Carrier play on TV -- since Hawaii's games are at night and start late on the  West Coast because of the time difference.  </P> <P> Watching college football all day gets Odom fired up for his games later that  night.  </P> <P> "I couldn't live without ESPN," Odom said. "I watch sports all the time --  everything from football to the world championships of table tennis."  </P> <P> Then he gets in a dancing mood. Even Hawaii's coaches don't mind Odom's  displays of emotion.  </P> <P> "We don't want to demean our opponents," Wagner said. "But if a guy is playing  hard and makes a great play, and is showing genuine enthusiasm, that's great."  </P> <P> Odom doesn't figure to quit cutting the rug soon, either.  </P> <P> "Every now and then, my teammates make fun of me," he said. "But they know I'm  just having fun. As long as I keep doing my job and making sacks, I'll be  having fun."  </P></p>

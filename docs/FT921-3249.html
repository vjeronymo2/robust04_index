			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / EC to act on bank loans today EC finance ministers are expected to agree today on Community-wide standards to prevent banks and credit institutions collapsing by lending too much to individual clients, Andrew Hills reports from Brussels. Portugal, which holds the EC presidency, is to put forward a compromise eventually preventing lenders granting loans worth more than 25 per cent of their shareholders' funds to a single borrower or group of borrowers. A single loan worth more than 10 per cent of shareholders' funds would have to be cleared with national banking supervisors. Ministers will today try to agree a transition period for banks in some countries such as France and Italy, which are currently allowed to grant loans to a single client up to a 40 per cent limit. The European Commission would like this cut to 25 per cent within five years, but member states are likely to settle for the longer eight-year transition proposed by the Portuguese. Britain limits banks' large risks to 25 per cent of shareholders' funds.</p>

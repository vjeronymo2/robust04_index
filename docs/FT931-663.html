			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / US lectures on economic co-operation ring hollow US President Bill Clinton, nearly two thirds of the way through the first hundred days of his administration, has good reason to feel pleased. The budget package is making good progress through Congress, relations with the Federal Reserve appear cordial, long-term interest rates have fallen and the US economy is conveniently accelerating. In short, the domestic economic agenda looks under control. His only disappointment is the tardy pace at which the rest of the world is falling into line. Russian president Boris Yeltsin can hardly be blamed for his current plight, and the US, like the rest of the world, has little option but to mouth support and wait with crossed fingers. But other countries that do control their domestic policy agendas, notably Germany and Japan, appear less willing to follow the world leader's example. Undeterred, the Clinton administration has quickly adopted the standard US presidential practice of lecturing other countries on how to manage their affairs, with the US Treasury taking the lead on the lecture circuit. Germany, the G7 finance ministers were told, should cut its interest rates more rapidly in order to kick-start European demand (for US exports). Japan, senior Treasury officials publicly imply, should be using fiscal policy in a more aggressively expansionary way to stimulate Japanese demand (for US exports). Would-be recipients of aid and debt relief should liberalise their economies and open their markets (to US exports). Yet, while it is easy to see why the world's only superpower speaks its mind, it is less obvious that it has the moral right to do so. While lecturing other countries about their responsibilities, the world's richest nation continues to benefit from a huge net resource flow from the developed and developing world alike. At its peak in 1987, the net resource transfer to the US was Dollars 151.4bn (Pounds 106.6bn), of which over Dollars 70bn came from developing countries, equivalent to 2 per cent of developing country GDP. The cumulative flow since 1980 is a little over Dollars 980bn. The US might bridle at these statistics. The net resource flow (equivalent to the US current account deficit minus net interest, profits and dividends) is, after all, the product of millions of individual, private and voluntary decisions. Yet the US, by virtue of its size and economic power, can alter the incentives that private individuals face. Hence, the rise of the US fiscal deficit in the 1980s was, in part, responsible for the rise in world interest rates and the flood of capital into the US. This sharp rise in real interest rates encouraged US commercial banks to liquidate their third world lending to take advantage of the higher domestic returns, thus bringing on the debt crisis. Not that the US can take all the blame. While profligate US fiscal policy sucked resources in, mistaken domestic policies in many developing countries also drove resources towards the US. This was particularly true of Latin America and Africa for whom the stock of flight capital is estimated at a third to two thirds of annual GDP. For all its good intentions, the Clinton administration will continue to suck scarce resources towards the world's richest country. Its budget plans envisage a budget deficit of over 3 per cent of GDP by 1998 while the combination of a nascent recovery and persistently low US national savings will expand the current account deficit over the next year. It is the regional profile of America's capital donors, not the demand placed on them, that appears to be altering. Budget deficit-burdened Europe is now importing capital from the US, while eastern Europe is drawing on US savings. Meanwhile, economic reform and debt relief in Latin America has made the region a magnet for portfolio investment, capturing almost all of the 135 per cent (Dollars 4.7bn) increase in annual equity flows to developing counties over the past three years. This leaves an extraordinary alliance of Japan, east Asia and debt-burdened Africa to finance the world's largest, and least progressive, economic assistance programme.</p>

			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Cardoso secures clear win in main Brazilian states Brazil's president-elect Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso emerged as the biggest winner from Tuesday's gubernatorial elections after candidates from his centre-left Social Democracy party (PSDB) won in two of the country's most important states and looked set for victory in a third. The PSDB's strong showing should help Mr Cardoso attract support to build a majority in Congress and will strengthen his bargaining power in negotiations over appointments to his government, set to take office on January 1. The PSDB's most important victories came in the state of Sao Paulo, where former senator Mr Mario Covas won easily, and in Minas Gerais, where Mr Eduardo Azeredo was proclaimed winner with more than 90 per cent of votes counted. In Rio de Janeiro, where vote counting was proceeding very slowly, exit polls showed the PSDB candidate to be the clear winner. Control over these three states, which account for about 60 per cent of Brazil's GDP, should help Mr Cardoso maintain the fight against inflation and underpin the new Real currency, which he planned when finance minister. PSDB candidates were also declared to have won in the northeastern state of Sergipe and to be well ahead in Para. Including a state won in first round elections last month, the PSDB now controls six of Brazil's 27 states, compared to only one before the polls. Only the Democratic Movement (PMDB), Brazil's biggest political party, controls more states and looks set to elect at least eight governors. In Rio, where the army took to the streets and manned polling stations following widespread fraud at aborted elections last month, voting was peaceful. The restaged elections, for state and federal legislators, delayed vote counting in the gubernatorial race. Once counting is completed, the army is likely to prepare its next move against the city's drug traffickers, approved by the federal government two weeks ago. The left-wing Workers Party (PT), whose candidate Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva lost to Mr Cardoso in the presidential race, succeeded in electing its first ever governors. The PT won the small southern state of Esprito Santo and a second candidate looked set to win in the capital, Braslia. The big loser was the right-wing Liberal Front party, which appeared to have won only one state, Bahia.</p>

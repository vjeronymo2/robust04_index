			<p>BFN     [Text] Contadora Island (Panama), 21 May (ACAN-EFE) --  Panamanian President Guillermo Endara today told ACAN-EFE he is  quite concerned about the current situation in Haiti; adding  that the U.S. invasion in that Caribbean country "is imminent."    A total commercial embargo against Haiti will begin this  evening (0401 GMT Sunday) to force the military coupists to  restore power to President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, whom they  ousted on 30 September 1991.    Endara, who assumed power on 20 December 1989 after the U.S.  intervention in Panama, stated he is closely following events in  Haiti, and he said the invasion "is coming."    Moreover, the Panamanian president deplored the way in which  former Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez was arrested and  taken to prison because he was president of his country on two  occasions.    Endara, who said he feels a lot of sympathy for Perez  whether  or not he perpetrated any crime, said the case should have been  handled differently because it involves a friend of the region.  Endara added that another measure should have been adopted, for  example "house imprisonment."    Likewise, Endara said he will travel to Tegucigalpa on  Tuesday to meet with his Central American counterparts and U.S.  Vice President Al Gore. The purpose of the meeting is to  analyze the agenda for the "Summit of the Americas," to be held  in Miami in December.    Endara, who will leave his post on 1 September, explained he  has already talked with his successor, Ernesto Perez Balladares,  to review everything that will be discussed in next week's  meeting with Gore.</p>

			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Spurs antagonists score series of own goals  -The boardroom clash between Terry Venables and Alan Sugar IT IS a rare chairman of a public company who openly admits to knowing nothing about the service he provides his customers. Mr Alan Sugar, chairman of Tottenham Hotspur Football Club, cheerfully admits he knows nothing about football. Furthermore, having on Monday successfully won a High Court judge's backing to sack Mr Terry Venables, the chief executive, he says he will continue to keep his 'nose out of football.' Mr Venables, a notable footballer and on-the-field tactician, knew nothing about running a business, according to Mr Sugar. The two should have made a great team. But as Mr Sugar's decision to sack Mr Venables clearly demonstrates, the club's two largest shareholders have strung together little more than a series of own goals over the past month. Yesterday Mr Venables, who continues to hold a 22 per cent equity stake in the north London soccer club, remained publicly defiant, but nevertheless appeared to be somewhat on the defensive. At a press conference held in Scribes West, his private members club in the basement of Barkers store in Kensington High Street, he defended his record at Spurs and attacked Mr Sugar for his 'unfounded accusations' and 'innuendo.' He professed to be determined to go ahead with a court bid to force Mr Sugar to sell him his 48 per cent stakeholding despite Monday's High Court setback. 'The real issue is to get Alan Sugar to sell his shares in the Plc,' he said but declined to identify his financial backers. 'I cannot say who my backers are,' he said,'these people do not want to be dragged into court.' By contrast, Mr Sugar, speaking from the White Hart Lane headquarters he now dominates, appeared relaxed and dismissive of Mr Venables' rearguard action. 'That game is over,' he said. Mr Sugar faces, however, a significant challenge. It is unlikely he has ever had to deal with a more volatile clutch of assets - some of whom have requested a transfer to other clubs. Nor will he have seen a more fiery customer base - although he says sales evaporated at Amstrad in the late 1980s when IBM overnight cut its prices on personal computers. Mr Sugar was most dismissive of the threat of a player boycott. He said no players were currently up for sale. Requests for transfers from Neil Ruddock and Nick Barmby had been rejected. Ray Clemence and Doug Livermore, the assistant coaches, would continue with day to day running of the team. Buying and selling of players would resume, however, as a normal part of the close season club activity. Mr Sugar saved his sweetest message, however, for the fans who appear to resent his early statements that a football club was a business which had to make money. 'It has to be profitable and it is a business and I do have a lot of confidence in sport and leisure,' Mr Sugar said almost apologetically. But 'it has become close to my heart and I enjoy it tremendously. But that will not make me go raving mad with my cheque book.' By declining to get involved in the footballing side, Mr Sugar has effectively spiked one of Mr Venables guns. Asked if he thought Mr Sugar was the best person to run Spurs, Mr Venables said he did not think so and added, 'he is going to have to rely on other people.' And on the boycott? Mr Venables was careful to protect his stake in the club. Asked whether he was in favour of fans boycotting season ticket sales and about the rumours of mass defection by players, he said he wanted the club to 'go forwards' and 'do well' in order to protect his investment. Just how badly his and Mr Sugar's investments have been damaged by the month long legal skirmish will probably only emerge once the season restarts. However, Mr Sugar already has an answer if attendance is low. 'If we are drawn against Oldham in our first home game I will use that as an excuse for why attendance is low.'</p>

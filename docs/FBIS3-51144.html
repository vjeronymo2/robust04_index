			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Liliana Gutierrez; from the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>   [Text] The Colombian Government, through Foreign Minister  Noemi Sanin Posada de Rubio, has filed a formal protest with the  Venezuelan Government for the violation of its sovereignty by a  Venezuelan National Guard helicopter in the area of Arauca.  This is an excerpt of the formal protest note:    It textually reads: According to the results of the  preliminary investigations conducted by the appropriate  organizations, it has been established that once the aircraft  illegally entered Colombian territory, its crew began stopping  and detaining Colombian nationals, mistreating them, and taking  away their belongings. This is a violation of international and  internal norms protecting the sovereignty and integrity of  states and private property. After the incidents mentioned  above, the Colombian nationals who were being held were forced  to board the helicopter that later crashed, injuring some of  them.    The formal protest note adds: The Colombian Government, in  condemning these incidents, is attentively awaiting the results  of the investigation. It hopes the results will enable  authorities to determine who was responsible, as well as to  impose severe punishment on those responsible in order to avoid  situations in the future that could tarnish the existing  atmosphere of understanding between our peoples and governments.    Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin will turn over to the  Venezuelan  Government the protest on the violation of Colombian airspace  and territory following the incident with the Venezuelan  National Guard helicopter, which crashed in the Puerto Rico area  in Arauca Department. The foreign minister asked authorities to  investigate and punish those found responsible for abuses  committed against peasants in the region.    Even though the diplomatic language was one of mutual praise  and the incident was played down, Colombia gave the Venezuelan  authorities the evidence gathered by the Prosecutor General's  Office and the Defense Ministry.    Meanwhile, Venezuelan Defense Minister Radames Munoz said  the  incident was due to mechanical problems with the helicopter and  added that Colombian sovereignty was not violated and peasants  were not mistreated.    Finally, there was a border commission meeting in Caracas.  Members reviewed the report drafted by Deputy Pompeyo Marquez in  which it was revealed that along the 2,000-km border there are  more than 70 areas where conflicts have occurred.</p>

			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Letter: The FT and the British election - wrong, wrong but for the right reasons, and right Sir, I have fully appreciated the identifying feature of the Financial Times being pink in colour but I had not realised how indicative it was. Your leading article 'The Day of Decision' in your edition the day of the election ends with a bias towards the Labour party risking change for the sake of it. If you have reasonable memories of the 1960s and the 1970s you will remember what 'grey days' these were with union leaders and politicians hogging the headlines telling us how to run our lives. There was no pride in being British and our industry was very unimpressive with low morale. We live in a different world today although it may not be a better world for many. However, there have been many achievements which I feel the press and the politicians might willingly recognise, whatever their colour or creed. My disappointment in the general election was that the politicians failed to raise any proper debate upon which we should decide for whom to vote. This is surely only surpassed by the failure of the press properly to draw this to the attention of the public. The record of the Labour party in government has not been very satisfactory, nor indeed has any other party. The purpose of any government is to provide a stable background in which we can lead our lives and prosper. On the social front it is important to help those most in need efficiently and without wasting tax payers' money. The eventual question to be answered surely is, do you trust Labour to spend your money better than the Conservatives? Certainly Labour will spend more of your money] This factor decided my vote] Hugh Marsden, SP Angel &amp; Co, BIIBA House, 14 Bevis Marks, London EC3A 7NT</p>

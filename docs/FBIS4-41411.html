			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report based on figures supplied by Russian </F> Federation Government's Center for Economic Conditions:  "Inflation, Are You Sleeping Or Finished?"]    [Text] The Russian Federation Government's Center for  Economic Conditions reports that, according to figures from  state statistical organs, the overall inflation rate was 100.8  percent over the past week, 102.8 percent since the start of the  month, and up 1.8 times since the start of the year. Price  growth was approximately identical for foodstuffs, nonfood  goods, and paid services to the population.    We congratulate our readers -- the past week saw the lowest  level of inflation (0.8 percent) in the past 30 months.    Consumer prices of goods and services in the Central  Chernozem, Volga, and Urals Regions remained virtually at last  week's level, and in four economic regions they changed by less  than 1 percent. Only in the Northern, Central, Volgo-Vyatka, and  West Siberia Regions was their growth slightly over 1 percent.    The most marked increase last week was for fruit (up 4.9  percent), groats, pasta, and salt (up 1.7 percent), and bread  and loaves (up 1.3 percent).    Prices of butter, vegetable oil, fish, and vodka did not  increase. Eggs were 2 percent cheaper compared with the end of  May.    The average cost of a basket of 19 of the most important  foodstuffs as of 14 June was 56,000 rubles [R] over the month --  an increase of 1.1 percent on the week, of 3.8 percent since the  start of the month, and of 80 percent since the start of the  year. The basket cost R53,900 in the official trading network,  and R68,700 at markets, stalls, or from private traders (in  other words, still 30 percent dearer). The spread between the  maximum and minimum cost of the basket in different Russian  cities was 260 percent (as against 250 percent in the previous  week).    The most "expensive" area in terms of the cost of the basket  is still the Far East Economic Region -- R91,200 over the month.  The basket cost R43,200 -- or less than half as much -- in the  "cheapest" region (Central Chernozem Region).    The biggest increase in the cost of the basket in Russian  regions was in the North Caucasus and East Siberia Regions -- up  by 6.3 and 4.3 percent respectively. There was hardly any  increase at all in the cost of the basket for the residents of  the Volgo-Vyatka, Central Chernozem, and Volga Regions.    In Moscow the cost of the basket of 19 of the most important  foodstuffs was up by 4.4 percent over the week to stand at  R63,800 at 14 June. There was hardly any increase in the cost  of the basket in St. Petersburg -- its cost there being R55,300.  Moscow moved up from 36th to 30th on the list of cities  surveyed, while St. Petersburg is in 50th place (49th last week).    Prices for nonfood goods also increased minimally -- by just  0.9 percent. The largest increases over the week were for  wallpaper, medicine, and matches (up 3 percent) and for  children's knitwear and summer footwear (up 2 percent). Fuel  prices were unchanged.    The differences in the price dynamics of nonfood goods in  different economic regions were insignificant last week. Prices  of nonfood goods increased by between 0.2 percent in the East  Siberia Region and 1.6 percent in the Volgo-Vyatka Region.  Moreover, price growth for industrial goods was higher than the  Russian average in the Central Chernozem, Central, Urals, and  West Siberia Regions.    The "costliest" cities in terms of prices of nonfood goods  continue to be Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy, Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk,  Novyy Urengoy, Yakutsk, and Magadan.</p>

			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> SOVIET TO TAKE RIBS INTO SPACE  </P> <P> The first Soviet journalist in space will dine on barbecued ribs from John  Robertson's Beale Street Barbecue restaurant in Memphis during a space flight  next year, a restaurateur said. Thomas (Silky) Sullivan, who is known as  Memphis's ambassador of barbecue, made the announcement Wednesday night upon  his return from a 10-day trip to the Soviet Union. Soviet broadcaster Nick  Lutsenko will take the ribs into space next year on a Soviet space flight,  Sullivan said. "They liked the barbecue sauce so much they tore the Berlin Wall  down trying to get some," Sullivan joked.  </P></p>

			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / World Commodities Prices: Wool News that the Australian government was taking measures to alleviate the impact of the wool crisis on growers, by helping those in debt with an interest rate subsidy and by lessening pressures on those disposing of the wool stockpile had no obvious immediate market impact. Wool prices yesterday were easier at auction again, though not by much and with some possible signs of firming at the close. The market indicator fell by 5 cents, which added to Tuesday's 10 cents established yet another new low point of 381 cents a Kg.</p>

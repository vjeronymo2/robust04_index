Mr. Hong said that the 3,000-kilometre-long coastline in  Fujian was ridden with smuggling activities, with the smuggled  items switched from the traditional ones of cigarettes, alcohol  and native products to drugs, pornographic articles, electric  appliances and cars. All such smuggling was conducted in a much  more concealed way and with greater cunning. Worse was the  involvement of some Sino-foreign joint-ventured enterprises in  the smuggling in the name of imports of raw and processed  material. They smuggled car parts and electric appliances  hidden with normal import items making it difficult for customs  to discover.    Mr. Hong saw smuggling following several ways. First, the  smuggling groups tended to be well organized and covering wider  areas, including Hong Kong, Thailand, the Philippines and South  Korea.    Second, the areas at home included in smuggling activities  extended from the coastal areas along Fujian, Zhejiang and  Guangdong in the past to wider areas.    Third, the equipment involved in smuggling tended to be  modernized, with speedboats capable of sailing at up to 40 sea  miles per hour as well as advanced communications devices.    Since there was a shortage of input of resources into the  fight against smuggling, the equipment used by marine  anti-smuggling teams in the Mainland was old-fashioned when  compared with that employed by the smugglers. Mr. Hong said he  was convinced that the state should earmark part of money put at  hundreds of millions of renminbi resulting from the seizure of  smuggled items every year to strengthen the marine force to  counter smuggling at sea.</p>

			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAMILY OF MAN KILLED BY DEPUTIES YEAR AGO STILL MOURNS FOR HIM  </P> <P> A year after an unarmed Cerritos man was shot and killed by Los Angeles County  sheriff's deputies after a lengthy car chase, 30 family members and friends  gathered Wednesday in Cypress at the grave of Hong Pyo Lee to remember him and  to press their demands for legal action against the deputies.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County district attorney's office, following a six-week  investigation last spring, cleared five deputies of criminal wrongdoing in the  shooting, which drew loud cries of racial discrimination and police brutality  from the Korean community.  </P> <P> Since then, Lee's parents have filed a $5.5-million federal lawsuit alleging  that Lee's civil rights were violated. The U.S. Department of Justice is also  conducting an investigation into the civil rights issue, according to attorneys  for the Lee family and for the Sheriff's Department.  </P> <P> During Wednesday's service at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Lee's relatives and  their attorney, George V. Denny III, maintained that pretrial depositions from  two Long Beach police officers, Richard R. Boatwright and Mario Razo, reinforce  their contention that the 21-year-old Lee was killed wrongfully.  </P> <P> The Long Beach officers, who had pursued Lee along with the deputies and  witnessed the fatal shooting, both stated in sworn depositions that they were  "amazed" at the deputies' conduct.  </P> <P> Moreover, according to the deposition transcript, seven-year police veteran  Boatwright said that, after the shooting, he turned to Razo, and said, "We just  observed the sheriff's execute somebody."  </P> <P> Neither Boatwright nor Razo, who said in his deposition that he could not  remember Boatwright using the word execution, could be reached Wednesday for  comment.  </P> <P> Attorney David D. Lawrence, representing the Sheriff's Department, Wednesday  questioned the Long Beach officers' accounts, saying, "I'm confident the  deputies acted properly and did what they had to do."  </P> <P> At the graveside service, Lee's father, liquor store owner Sung Kyu Lee,  tearfully declared, "It is wrong what happened and justice should be served  here. . . . We have to get to the bottom of this."  </P> <P> The incident began when Lee, driving late at night in an unincorporated area  near Lynwood, was spotted by sheriff's deputies running a stop sign. Rather  than pull over, Lee accelerated and led deputies on a 15-mile chase that ended  in a north Long Beach industrial area.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Guns Drawn  </P> <P> The five deputies got out of their vehicles with their guns drawn, and one,  John Chapman, 30, approached the driver's side of Lee's vehicle, demanding that  Lee get out.  </P> <P> The deputies told investigators later that they fired at Lee only after he  suddenly shifted his car into reverse and attempted to run them down. That  account was corroborated by a truck driver, who told investigators that he was  parked nearby and saw the entire incident.  </P> <P> The district attorney's report concluded that the deputies acted in  self-defense when they shot Lee nine times. An autopsy had found traces of  cocaine in his body.  </P> <P> However, Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard B. Healey acknowledged in his report that  Razo and Boatwright contradicted the five deputies and the truck driver. The  two Long Beach officers told investigators that Lee's car never moved backward  toward the deputies.  </P> <P> "Such conflicts in the evidence are not unusual," Healey wrote, "and do not  necessarily have sinister significance."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Give Added Details  </P> <P> In their subsequent pretrial depositions last October, the Long Beach officers  elaborated.  </P> <P> Asked if the lives of the deputies appeared to be in danger when they fired  their weapons, Razo replied, "Not what I could see, no." The officer added that  the shooting did not appear to be a justifiable homicide.  </P> <P> Boatwright, when asked how he characterized the incident to Razo, said he "used  the word execution." Razo, however, said he could not remember Boatwright using  the term.  </P> <P> Attorney Lawrence on Wednesday questioned the "execution" statement, saying  that "if it happened, it would have been remembered (by Razo)."  </P> <P> Healey, contacted Wednesday, said Boatwright did not use the term execution  during the district attorney's investigation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Could Be Reopened  </P> <P> "We're always open to the possibility of reopening a case if dramatic new  evidence comes forward," Healey said.  </P> <P> Denny, who is representing the Lee family in their civil suit scheduled for  trial in July, said Wednesday, "I would like to see the case reopened (but) I  have severe doubts whether, at this time, (the district attorney's office) has  any inclination that way at all."  </P> <P> "I don't think justice has been served yet," Denny added. " . . . It is clear  from the testimony there was no need to shoot (Lee)."  </P></p>

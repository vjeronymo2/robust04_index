			<p><P> January 20, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THE HIGH SCHOOLS;  </P> <P> BELL-JEFF, NOTRE DAME TO SQUARE OFF IN LEAGUE'S INAUGURAL SHOWDOWN  </P> <P> It might not be worthy of Super Bowl-type hype, but Saturday night's San  Fernando Valley League showdown between Bell-Jeff and visiting Notre Dame  promises to be a super shoot-out.  </P> <P> The first-year rivals in the fledgling league are 3-0 in league play and  playing at the top of their games.  </P> <P> Bell-Jeff (15-1) is led by 4 senior scoring threats -- Nick Sanderson (22.9  points a game), Greg Dunn (15.9), Chris Dyer (12.1) and Ray Witt (10.3).  </P> <P> Notre Dame (9-8) is coming off a 101-40 thumping of former Del Rey League rival  Alemany, and although the Knights have struggled to surpass the .500 mark,  Coach Mick Cady says that the hard times are in the past.  </P> <P> "Our guys," Cady said emphatically, "are still hungry to gain a little  respect."  </P> <P> Senior forwards Brian Jones and Ken Hicks have dominated for the Knights. Jones  is averaging 25.2 points a game. Hicks, who has recovered from a preseason  ankle injury, is averaging 19.8 over 7 games.  </P> <P> "Jones is going to shoot it, Hicks is going to shoot it," Bell-Jeff Coach Joe  Dunn said. "You got to pay attention to both of them."  </P> <P> Other league coaches are paying close attention to the 7 p.m. game. The winner  will be the front-runner for the league championship.  </P> <P> "It'll either be a close game that can go either way, or Notre Dame will blow  them out," Chaminade Coach Mike Lynn said. "But with Bell-Jeff, you've got to  be able to score because they can score from anywhere."  </P> <P> Said St. Genevieve Coach Scott Smith: "I think Notre Dame is a little stronger,  but I think it will be close."  </P> <P> Pioneer chicken: Ever trendy, Simi Valley has added to its basketball games one  of those cute mascots that are all the rage. The problem is that Simi Valley's  true mascot, the Pioneer, isn't all that cuddly -- it looks more like Davey  Crockett after a 3-day hike.  </P> <P> So, this season, a 6-foot chicken, dressed beak to claw in yellow feathers,  struts around Simi Valley's gym and high-fives players, schmoozes with the  cheerleaders and generally whips the place into a frenzy.  </P> <P> Actually, the most humorous part of the Simi Valley chicken's shake and bake is  when it merely stands in proximity to Mike Wawryk, the Pioneers' 6-5 center.  Wawryk and the chicken, which also dons a Simi Valley uniform, wear the same  number -- 31. The chicken, however, wears an away uniform, which brought the  inevitable question to Wawryk: "Do you switch uniforms on the road?"  </P> <P> Wawryk said that they didn't share Pioneer duds and added, "I think it's nice.  I thought it was funny when I first saw it."  </P> <P> Apparently, Wawryk gets a little ribbing from his teammates.  </P> <P> No panic yet: Three losses in 5 Marmonte League games for Newbury Park have  been somewhat of a surprise for a team that was 9-2 entering league play, but  the Panthers are not fretting. In fact, a mention of the dry spell brought only  a promise from forward Wayne Cook, the team leader in scoring and rebounds.  </P> <P> "We're going to be there," he said matter-of-factly.  </P> <P> By there, Cook meant in the race for the league title. But to get there,  Newbury Park must start in Camarillo, where tonight the Panthers will play the  Scorpions (4-1 in league play).  </P> <P> Big Ten bound: Chaminade lineman Steve Rosen (6-3, 245) has verbally committed  to attend Northwestern after visiting the Big Ten school last week. Rosen also  had been recruited by New Mexico State, Rutgers and the Naval Academy but made  a decision after his only visit.  </P> <P> The frown of renown: There is a more than passing resemblance between Cleveland  forward Bobby McRae and former NBA star Maurice Lucas, whose scowl was as  legendary as his bruising style of play.  </P> <P> First, there are the facial similarities. "I never really thought about it that  way, but I can see it," Cleveland Coach Bob Braswell said. "I guess he does  look a little like Lucas."  </P> <P> Second, there is the intimidation factor. Like Lucas, who before his retirement  last season was often called the meanest man in the NBA, McRae has the look of  a hit man when on the court.  </P> <P> "Bobby has the ultimate game face," Braswell said. "When he's on the court, he  does not smile. He's very intense."  </P> <P> McRae, a 6-4 junior, is also Cleveland's best defensive player and routinely  guards the opposition's best front-line player. He has been no offensive  liability, however. McRae has made 28 of 54 field-goal attempts (53%) and is  averaging 7.9 rebounds a game while playing in the shadow of Division I-bound  Warren Harrell (New Mexico State) and Lucious Harris (Cal State Long Beach).  </P> <P> When Braswell looks at McRae, he is reminded of another Cleveland player known  for his intensity.  </P> <P> "Personally, I think he looks like Trevor," Braswell said of 1986 graduate  Trevor Wilson, now a starting forward at UCLA.  </P> <P> Missing Lancers: Perusers of basketball box scores may have noticed that guard  Nate Conner and forward Sean Watkins did not start for Grant (10-3, 2-1) in  last week's 57-51 victory over Reseda.  </P> <P> Although Conner and Watkins were benched for disciplinary reasons, neither  player was really in Lancer Coach Howard Levine's doghouse.  </P> <P> "It was nothing drastic," Levine said. "But both players missed a practice last  week. . . . We have a rule that if you miss a practice, you don't start in the  next game."  </P> <P> Conner and Watkins both started in Grant's 58-38 victory over Van Nuys last  Friday.  </P> <P> Add Grant: Levine has been pleased with the recent play of junior forward Setro  Terzian, who scored 19 points and grabbed 27 rebounds in 2 games last week.  </P> <P> "He's finally starting to assert himself," Levine said. "He took it upon  himself to take the initiative at the offensive end of the court against Reseda  and it showed."  </P> <P> Staff writers Tim Brown, Steve Elling, John Ortega and Vince Kowalick  contributed to this notebook.  </P></p>

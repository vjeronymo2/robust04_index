			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Tawfiq Abu-Bakr (main editor), Ahmad Dawud </F> (Amman), and Sami al-Masri (Nablus): "Decisionmaking Mechanism  Took Shape Under Difficult Circumstances, Flabby Leadership  Caused by Talents Staying Away"--first two paragraphs are  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT introduction]    [Text] This series of interviews and testimonies by 20  Palestinian personalities with differing orientations aims to  deepen understanding of the issues regarding the reform needed  in the PLO's structure in order to build strong foundations for  the coming national authority. It also aims at spreading fair,  objective dialogue without charges and countercharges on the  subject of democracy and pluralism in the period of transition  from the age of revolution to the age of statehood.    The reader will note divergent ideas and visions of the  future in the participants' interviews and testimonies regarding  the timing of reform, its needs and possibilities, and who  exactly can bear the burden of advocating and undertaking the  mission.  <H5>  First Interview: Introduction </H5>   Many on the Palestinian scene support demands for reform.  They see a need to end impromptu one-man action, build  institutions, and put the right man in the right place. But they  divide over timing. Some think that intensifying pressure on the  Palestinian leadership at this time will weaken its negotiating  ability, particularly as it is exposed to formidable pressures  from Arab and international parties that for their part are  exploiting the reformers' demands and the embarrassed position  of the Palestinian leadership in order to demand concessions  from it. Others think that this is the very time to build strong  foundations for the coming national entity. They believe that by  acceding to demands for reform, the leadership will strengthen  its negotiating position and increase its immunity to Arab and  international pressures. They say that the question of  timing--that others might take advantage of public criticism  leveled at misguided policies--has remained a sword waved over  our heads for nearly a quarter of a century; yet our enemies  hang out their laundry, talk to each other bluntly, make the  necessary revisions, and emerge stronger.    [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] To which of the two points of view do  you  incline, and why?  <H5>  Ridwan Abu-'Ayyash </H5>   [Abu-'Ayyash] To begin, one must stress that the question of  democratic dialogue within the one Palestinian household--to  restructure and deepen it and build its institutions--is a vital  demand for which the PLO has continued to work from its first  inception and for which it has continued to fight to the present  day.    Certainly the issue now on the table is the continuation of  a  previous course. It is an assured necessity. No one disagrees  about it who believes that the institutions of the revolution  should be converted into state institutions as a structure that  can shoulder the burdens of organizing the entire Palestinian  people, establishing its sovereignty, and arranging its  institutional authorities.    When we talk about democracy or dialogue and about spreading  an atmosphere of discussing these subjects among the ranks of  the Palestinian people, I believe we all as a people bear full  responsibility for such a structure. In other words, the  prevalence of a spirit of initiative, organizing institutions,  and strengthening the dynamic of their operation on a basis of  description, classification, and institution building are  matters that the people can undertake.    Timing must be taken into account, just as one must make  certain that the method and means are salutary: for using a  effective, efficient mechanism at a suitable time that fits the  goal will surely lead to good positive results. Spreading  dialogue among the ranks of the people is a matter that rests on  leaders' shoulders and falls under the category of  indoctrination, direction, and good mobilization.    When we talk about timing, I think the question is not when  democracy and constructive, serious dialogue shall begin;  neither is it when we shall or shall not approve it. Timing  means choosing the best moment and time to make it succeed and  to concentrate on it with the leadership. At the same time it  must be built basically among the community's classes,  institutions, and sections; for the leadership essentially is  part of the people. When rules for the structure are produced  and approved as a result of constructive dialogue, disagreements  will be removed. The dimensions of disagreement will shrink, and  the leadership's participation in the building process will  become fruitful and fulfill its purpose. To further clarify the  subject of the timing of the reform process, we say that  democratic reform is not contingent on any particular time;  however, before talking about it, one must define its meaning,  goal, and means. These concepts must be brought to the grass  roots so that they can interact, crystallize, and be framed, and  so that consciousness of them can be spread. The soil in which  the concepts grow thus will be made fertile. In any case, the  concepts are a collective responsibility, not one limited to  individuals. Therefore the question about reform and its timing  should begin with another question: Has this subject been taken  to the broadest ranks of the people? Who is doing so? Have we  been able to bring the question to public notice and order its  priorities, so that we can move from the base to the leadership?  I want to stress now that we are not subject to a definite time  in establishing and rooting democratic methods among the ranks  of our people, who have fought and still are fighting for their  realization.  <H5>  Salih Qallab </H5>   [Qallab] Reform is something required in every regime and  revolution. After each stage, one must turn a new page. One must  look at the previous stage's mistakes, to correct them and  reform its corruption, if there was any.    As for what is being tried now--that is, raising the subject  of carrying out democratic reform in the PLO and its  organizations--the matter has been raised on the basis of the  petition that was presented to Yasir 'Arafat. I do not think  this memorandum will lead to any results, because the persons  who prepared it were not qualified. For the most part they are  members of the very PLO groups that have to be reformed or are  cadres of the PLO itself.    Those who presented the memorandum may have had a variety of  motives. It may have been an unfortunate imitation of the Wafd  Party in Egypt. If the intention was to form a political party  that would prepare itself for a role in the coming Palestinian  authority, I think this road will not lead to what is desirable.    Many observations can be made about the performance of the  Palestinian leadership. Far from being recent, these  observations are very old. The reformists shared in the mistakes  of the leadership on various levels. Indeed, most of them were  spokesmen for the leadership: they were among those who played  fiddle for it and cast its errors in favorable light. They were  among those who incited its wrath against all demands for reform  or correction.    Now, when the Palestinian leadership is embarking on a  fierce  battle and fighting on many fronts, it would be better for these  people--members of the Fatah Revolutionary Council or political  bureau members of FIDA [Palestinian Democratic Union], the  Palestinian People's Party, or any other organizations--to play  their role in their organizations. For the road followed by the  "reformists" has been badly exploited by enemies of Palestinian  nationalism who hunt for small mistakes by the Palestinian  leadership, not to correct them, but to defame this course in  the minds of the Palestinian and Arab masses.    Don't misunderstand me. Naturally, I am not saying that  Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] is a democrat. It is unreasonable for  us to demand that 'Arafat's leadership be collective, as if it  were the leadership of a party in Switzerland or Sweden, not  part of current Palestinian reality.    [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] Then your objection is directed at the  individuals calling for reform.    [Qallab] My objection is not to the individuals. All respect  and love to them! But I do say that most of them are from the  second-and third-echelon leadership. They are among those who  participated in creating the Palestinian leadership in this  form. I think most of them are out to improve their positions on  the Palestinian ship of state or are seeking a special place in  the current negotiating process.    We know all about brother Hani al-Hasan's opposition. He was  at the head of the reformists and those demanding an improvement  in Palestinian negotiating performance. Yet, as soon as he was  brought into the arena, he forgot what he had being saying since  the Madrid conference. I think his fellow "reformists" are  following in his footsteps.    [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] But one notes that reform-minded  independents are the backbone of the current movement--in  addition, of course, to members of the groups. And the  independents who have no link to the official Palestinian  institutions are the most ardent of the current demanders of  reform!    [Qallab] The story about independents on the scene is  ridiculous. In reality it is an invention of Abu 'Ammar, when he  was displaying Fatah supporters who were not among the  movement's official members as if they were independents. The  fact is that bias on the Palestinian scene is not  organization-related, but political. I think that the  independents who are members of the Executive Committee and the  Palestinian National Council are closest to the Fatah political  line and to Abu 'Ammar specifically. Frankly, I would say that  although people who are organizationally independent may exist,  there is no one who is politically independent. In this sense,  the independents among the "reformists" are not independents at  all.    [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] Then do you object fundamentally to  reform?    [Qallab] I do not object to reform. As I said, it is  constantly desirable. But I do not see what is to be gained from  forming from among the Palestinian groups that participate in  the PLO a current that announces that it wants to lead the  reform. Why doesn't reform take place first within these groups  and parties and then widen to include the PLO and its agencies?  So if the brothers want reform, they should leave their groups  and form a powerful reform current responsive to the will of the  Palestinian people. Unfortunately, as people say, "Fodder is of  no use at the time of the attack."    The Palestinian people now need an entity--the establishment  of a state--even if it is not democratic. A state first must be  brought into existence. Afterward we can think about what can be  called a luxury in the Third World--namely, democratic  transformation.    [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] Why not create democratic foundations or  democratic political life before statehood, to guarantee the  sovereignty of a state of rights, law, and institutions?    [Qallab] As I understand it, the "reformists" want to  improve  the performance of the Palestinian leadership in the  negotiations; they do not want to lay foundations for the future  Palestinian state.    [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] The memorandum and the points of the  program that were approved subsequently explicitly advocate a  Palestinian state and the importance of participation by the  talents of the Palestinian people in these building processes on  democratic foundations!    [Qallab] I believe that the Palestinian people, as a result  of their special sufferings for more than 70 years, have  produced a democratic reality--to differing extents and degrees,  of course. The question now is whether we should put the cart  before the horse. Now we want the enemy to withdraw from  occupied Palestinian and Arab territory. We want to make a first  step toward establishing an independent Palestinian state.    [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] Demands for democracy are always  desirable and persistent. Emphasizing that the Palestinian state  should be a state of institutions and laws is a correct  position. However, I ask whether the storm now being raised  about reform by a group of people from within the Palestinian  organizations serves this goal.    [Qallab] I think that even if intentions are good, this  storm  will not lead to [anything but] increased distortion of the  Palestinian struggle and to its being portrayed as if it were  merely embezzlements and misuse of authority. Reform from within  the Palestinian scene must take place on the basis of conflict  within unity. We must be careful to choose the steps required at  each stage. In my opinion, the step required at this stage is to  rally internally. That is the basis.    [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] However, the "reformists" today are from  inside the Palestinian household and are its sons. No one can  impugn the sincerely democratic and reformist intentions of Dr.  Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, for example.    [Qallab] Let me say that the word "reform" has become a kind  of romance. I think that Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi should not be  behaving in this way. He is no onlooker; he belongs to the heart  of the Palestinian political process. So he should by no means  object like an outside observer, while he holds on to his  position within Palestinian political activity.    Why, for example, didn't the Israeli negotiator sitting  across from Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi at the same table resign,  given that he too was surprised by the Oslo agreement? Do you  think the head of the Jordanian delegation knows everything the  Jordanian Government is doing with regard to the Middle East  peace process?    Shim'on Peres agreed with Abu 'Ammar in Davos on a series of  issues, and Yitzhaq Rabin did not agree on them. Yet Peres did  not step aside from the negotiations, as Abu-Mazin [Mahmud  'Abbas] did when Abu-'Ammar objected to the results of his talks  in Cairo.    [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] We are not talking about individual  responsibilities, but about the absence of a system of  institutions in Palestinian activity--the absence of collective  decisionmaking and continued monopolization of decisions by the  Palestinian president.    [Qallab] The Palestinian case is very special. I am one of  those who lived through the experience of the siege of Beirut,  when Abu-'Ammar, despite the siege, made a point of collective  decisionmaking. Being under siege, the Palestinian leaders had  willingly entrusted all the reins of power to Yasir 'Arafat;  which was something normal and understandable. I do not think  that Yitzhaq Rabin makes his decisions after conducting a poll  that includes all members of his party or the participants in  his government. The most telling indication of this is the  existence of the so-called inner cabinet, which makes decisions  in Israel. Doesn't Yasir 'Arafat then have the right to have at  his side a small consultative council that makes sensitive  decisions and subsequently submits them to the wider and broader  Palestinian cadres?    [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] Naturally it is his right. But the  problem is that a considerable number of Palestinian talents who  could form a trustworthy consultative council have left the  ranks of official Palestinian activity--so many that it seems as  if most of those around Mr. Yasir 'Arafat are the sort of men  who tell him what he wishes to hear--not to mention their low  competence level and major questions about their integrity.    [Qallab] The Palestinian decisionmaking mechanism took shape  under well-known circumstances. Since the onset of the  Palestinian revolution in the mid-sixties, there has been a  struggle between those who want Palestinian decisionmaking to be  independent of certain Arab regimes and systems, but not from  the Arab liberation movement, and those who constituted  extensions of certain Arab regimes onto the Palestinian scene.    [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] Then are these Palestinian talents  responsible for what his happening in the PLO's organizations?    [Qallab] No, I am not accentuating Abu-'Ammar's constant  fear  of certain talents. I can state that many of those whom  Abu-'Ammar has established in sensitive positions to the  disadvantage of [other] talents have formed bridges to certain  Arab regimes on the Palestinian scene and have penetrated Arab  and non-Arab security agencies. There is a law in revolutions  that holds that the leadership should be protected from errors.  I think that by staying away from Abu-'Ammar, Palestinian  talents have paved the way for the spread of the flabbiness and  bureaucracy that we now see and that are the cause of the series  of errors that we now are attributing to the head of the PLO.</p>

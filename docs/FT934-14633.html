			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Restructure and new owners for Quiligotti QUILIGOTTI is proposing a restructuring and cash injection which is likely to lead to a change in control at the Stockport-based terrazzo tile and industrial flooring company. The proposals also include the acquisition of Chelsea Artisans and Microfloor. The moves follow results for the year to March 31 showing pre-tax losses widening from Pounds 1.83m to Pounds 3.3m. The loss meant that net assets fell to Pounds 1.5m, in breach of banking covenants. Borrowings at the period-end were Pounds 2.3m, with the expectation that they would rise to a seasonal peak of Pounds 3.5m this month. Turnover was Pounds 15.2m (Pounds 19.7m). The pre-tax figure was struck after exceptional costs of Pounds 1.2m (Pounds 280,000). Losses per share came out at 4.4p (5.8p). The USM-quoted shares, suspended on September 29 awaiting the announcement, resumed trading, falling  3/4 p to close at 1 1/2 p. Under a placing and open offer 252m shares are being placed by Strand Associates at 1 1/4 p. Some 109m of the shares are offered to shareholders on a 3-for-2 basis at the same price. To enable the offer to proceed, existing 5p shares will be divided into  1/2 p ordinary and 4 1/2 p deferred shares. As a result of the moves Strand, a private investment company formed in March, and its associates could hold up to 78.4 per cent of the enlarged capital. If the shareholders take up their full entitlement they would hold 53.9 per cent. Chelsea Artisans and Microfloor are managed by Mr James Walton, who becomes chief executive of the larger group, and Mr Jeremy Brassington, who becomes a non-executive director. The total consideration is Pounds 150,000, satisfied by the issue of shares, plus the discharge of shareholder loans of Pounds 150,000 and bank loans of Pounds 275,000.</p>

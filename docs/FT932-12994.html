			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Portillo sees modest but firm recovery BRITAIN is heading for an economic recovery which will be modest compared with that of the 1980s but should be better sustained, Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, said yesterday. Provisional first-quarter figures for gross domestic product to be published today are generally expected to signal a formal end to the recession. Mr Portillo said it was likely that rates of growth 'even a few years out' would not be as fast as in the 1980s, but that they would be 'better sustained, for a longer period of time and with greater certainty'. He said recent data on industrial production, retail sales, exports and from the housing market were 'very encouraging' while, contrary to expectations, there had been falls in unemployment. The government was confident that it would meet its goal of holding underlying inflation in the 1 per cent to 4 per cent target range this year and next. Mr Portillo, in an interview on BBC Radio's World this Weekend programme, promised the government would adjust its policies to keep inflation under control. Although 'there was no immediate prospect' of the UK rejoining the European exchange rate mechanism, the government would take account of the sterling exchange rate in pursuing its goal of low inflation. Mr Portillo rejected suggestions that Britain's manufacturing industry had been so weakened by the recession that the country faced another cycle of stop-go. 'I don't know that this recovery is going to be like other recoveries,' he said. He pointed out that UK manufacturing productivity and exports had never been higher. Because industry had kept control of wages, unit wage costs were falling, giving the British economy a lasting efficiency and competitive gain that was 'over and above' that conferred by the fall in the value of sterling since last September. Falling unit wage costs might already have contributed to surprise falls in unemployment in February and March. He urged managers, trade unions and opposition parties to support further wage restraint to ensure the recovery produced increased employment faster than before. Mr Portillo also sounded an optimistic note about UK export prospects in spite of the worsening economic condition of Britain's main European markets. People were still buying goods in markets that were less buoyant, while UK exporters were also active in markets outside Europe, he said. The government has passed a turning point in its fortunes, Sir Norman Fowler, the Conservative Party chairman, said yesterday. 'The fact of the matter is that the recovery has been taking place over the last 12 months, but it has now speeded up,' he said on the BBC TV Breakfast with Frost programme. But Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, said: 'Over the next two weeks, Sir Norman is going to try and con people into believing that all the economic problems of this country have blown away.' He said people could not trust the Tories' word or judgment.</p>

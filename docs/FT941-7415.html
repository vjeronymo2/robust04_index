			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / EU claims progress on Macedonia dispute Mr Hans van den Broek, EU foreign affairs commissioner, returned to Skopje yesterday, claiming some progress on his shuttle mission aimed at persuading Greece and Macedonia to resume talks in their dispute over the former Yugoslav republic's name and flag. The Dutch commissioner said after a meeting with Mr Carolos Papoulias, Greek foreign minister, that there 'were a number of positive points' to be relayed to Mr Kiro Gligorov, the Macedonian president. The EU mediation effort has been welcomed by Greece, which maintains that its European partners have not been supportive enough in the two-year dispute with Macedonia. Greece's decision last week to impose a trade embargo on Macedonia, which appears to violate Treaty of Rome requirements on EU trade, is seen as a way of involving the EU in the dispute while at the same time putting pressure on the Skopje government. Mr Gligorov, in a letter to the Greek prime minister, repeated his offer to sign a treaty guaranteeing the border with Greece, proposing that it should also be guaranteed by the EU. This would rebut the Greek demand that Macedonia's constitution should be changed on the grounds that it includes a territorial claim on the adjoining Greek province of Macedonia. Mr Gligorov called for talks to resume immediately under UN auspices, warning that the trade embargo would 'provoke undesirable consequences for peace and stability in the Balkans'. However, the letter made no mention of Greece's demand that Macedonia should change its flag, in recent weeks the most prominent issue of the dispute. Macedonian officials privately admit that the flag, carrying a starburst symbol associated with the ancient Macedonian kingdom of Alexander the Great, could be considered provocative.</p>

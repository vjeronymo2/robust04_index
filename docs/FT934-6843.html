			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Thorp - surplus in dispute Sir, Mr Yasutaka Moriguchi of the Science and Technology Agency's Atomic Energy Bureau says (Letters, November 15) 'the prospect that Japan will have no surplus of plutonium, including that from Thorp, is strictly maintained'. He cites figures of plutonium supply and demand contained in the Atomic Energy Commission's report of August 1991 on nuclear fuel cycling in Japan. Unfortunately, the demand estimates in this report are no longer regarded as credible inside or outside Japan. They imply that, between 1991 and 2010, 10-20 tonnes of plutonium will be consumed in fast reactors. But the Monju reactor is having teething troubles, and no site has yet been found for the larger Demonstration Fast Breeder Reactor. They imply that close to 10 tonnes will be consumed in the Demonstration Advanced Thermal Reactor, construction of which has not yet begun and for which the utilities have little enthusiasm. And they imply that 50 tonnes of plutonium will be used to fuel conventional thermal reactors, when utilities have serious qualms about the political and operational viability of this programme, and when total consumption to date has been 44 kilograms in fuel assemblies tested in the Mihama and Tsuruga reactors. My assessment (Letters, November 11) that Japanese plutonium surpluses could approach 20 tonnes by the year 2000 and 40 tonnes by 2010 if current reprocessing plans are implemented may therefore be conservative. But if Mr Moriguchi is correct and no Japanese surpluses are in prospect, why did Mr Kaneko (November 8) decide to draw attention to the need to store Japan's plutonium 'for some time' at Sellafield? Do their statements become compatible if a distinction is drawn between Japan's plutonium surplus and the surplus located in Japan, the idea now being to keep the latter to a minimum by holding the former in Britain and France?

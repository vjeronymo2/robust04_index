			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / School meals 'not healthy enough' School governors should do more to improve pupils' diets - which still contain too much fat and sugar and too little fibre, health campaigners said yesterday. The School Meals Campaign said many governors now negotiated individual contracts for catering, placing them in a good position to improve unhealthy diets. The campaign's chairman, Mr Tim Lang, professor of food policy at Thames Valley University, said: 'As school meals contracts come up for renewal, governors should make sure that nutritional standards are written into them. With local management of schools and grant-maintained schools, governors have unprecedented powers and responsibilities.' In its school meals charter, the campaign stresses that affordable meals should be available to all children at nationally agreed standards of nutrition. Schools should consult with parents, provide a range of food taking account of health, religious and ethnic preferences and try to ensure school meals 'are a positive and enjoyable experience'.</p>

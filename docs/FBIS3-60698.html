			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] India today cautioned the United States that  repealing the Pressler Amendment will legitimize Pakistan's  clandestine nuclear weapons program. New Delhi also expressed  concern that this will result in the delivery of the  state-of-the-art F-16 aircraft to Pakistan, providing it with a  greater number of delivery systems for weapons of mass  destruction.    Speaking at a lunch hosted in honor of the visiting U.S.  senators, including Mr. Pressler, the minister of state for  external affairs, Mr. Salman Khurshid, pointed out that Pakistan  already acknowledges possessing weapons of mass destruction. He  said the U.S. Administration move will, therefore, destabilize  the South Asian region. In such a scenario, India will need to  reappraise its defense policies.    The minister objected to India being lectured on the human  rights issue, especially in the light of a commitment to  democratic norms. Mr. Khurshid said India is faced with a proxy  war in Kashmir. He made it clear that motivated propaganda  against India on human rights will be counterproductive. The  U.S. senators--Mr. Pressler, Mr. Cochran, and Mr. Brown--are  currently on a visit to several Asian countries. They will also  hold talks with the prime minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao, and the  home minister, Mr. Chavan.</p>

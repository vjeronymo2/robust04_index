			<p><P> June 7, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> MARINE PILOTS ORDERED TO STOP FLYING, TAKE REFRESHER COURSE  </P> <P> Because a recent string of military aircraft accidents can be largely blamed on  human error, the commandant of the Marine Corps Tuesday ordered all Marine  pilots to leave their cockpits for a two-day safety refresher course over the  next two weeks.  </P> <P> Gen. Alfred M. Gray Jr. said that in the seven recent accidents, which claimed  the lives of 45 Marines, "air crew error predominates and most likely will be a  primary cause in all these mishaps."  </P> <P> Aircraft and crews based at Tustin and El Toro Marine Corps air stations in  Orange County have been involved in three of the fatal helicopter accidents,  accounting for 25 of the fatalities. One of the accidents involved a Marine  Corps reserve unit based at El Toro, and the other two in South Korea involved  personnel and an aircraft from the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing at El Toro and  Tustin.  </P> <P> "It is time to pause, catch our breath, and come to grips with the devastating  trend established this year," Gray said in a Teletype message to Marine bases  worldwide. "To that end, within the next two weeks, all aviation units will  conduct a two-day safety stand-down.  </P> <P> "Our machines are not letting us down; we are letting ourselves down," Gray  said.  </P> <P> Maj. Gen. Donald E.P. Miller, commander of the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing at El  Toro, said he has instructed his group and squadron commanders to complete the  refresher course by June 17.  </P> <P> "I would like to shut them all down at once for the two days of instruction,  but that is impossible," Miller said, adding that he has some aircraft in the  middle of missions. "I think it is a hell of a good idea. I think we have to  stop once in a while and say are we doing this right."  </P> <P> Gray's order affects 1,200 Marine Corps fighters, observation planes and  helicopters in 87 aviation squadrons worldwide.  </P> <P> "His concern is the number of deaths so far this year," said Lt. Col. Fred Peck  in Washington. Peck said Gray's action ordering all Marine Corps aviators to  the classroom was "unprecedented."  </P> <P> "It has been done squadron-wide or even wing-wide, but, the best I can  determine, never before Marine Corps-wide," he said.  </P> <P> The order came less than six months after Marine Corps aviators completed the  safest flying year ever.  </P></p>

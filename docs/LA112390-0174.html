			<p><P> November 23, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: BETWEEN WORKOUTS, TYSON LIKES TO PARTY LIKE A CHAMP  </P> <P> MIKE TYSON is training at Atlantic City's Trump Plaza. The former heavyweight  champ fights Alex Stewart on Dec. 9. Tyson, however, does believe that all work  and no play makes Mike a dull boy.  </P> <P> Tyson recently caught a performance by the O'Jays at Trop World. The group  spotted the big guy in the audience and pulled him up onstage, introducing him  as "the newest member of our group." The champ then joined them in a song.  </P> <P> Before this, Tyson turned up at the Trump Plaza showcase for the former Miss  America, Suzette Charles. Suzette, who has never wanted to reign alone like  Garbo, told her audience that she and the former champ were "more than just  good friends." That may indeed be true, but it wasn't Suzette who then  accompanied Mike on an upscale boutique shopping spree on the Boardwalk wherein  he spent $40,000 on clothes for himself and an unidentified lady friend. Tyson  has also been seen cruising Atlantic City in his bright red Ferrari, a tall and  gorgeous blond beside him.  </P> <P> I love to see young people having a good time, don't you?  </P> <P> LYRICIST FRED Ebb and composer John Kander ("Cabaret," "Chicago," "Flora the  Red Menace") are rewriting their 1977 Broadway musical "The Act" for the  talented Dorothy Loudon. Liza Minnelli originated the role of a famous singer  making a Las Vegas comeback, involved with an older man. She won a Tony award  for her tour de force performance.  </P> <P> Among the revisions for the new star is a change to show an older woman's  infatuation for a younger man.  </P> <P> THE CARNEGIE DELI in Beverly Hills is booked solid for a private party to be  held the night of Jan. 20, 1996. That's the day George Burns will turn 100.  </P></p>

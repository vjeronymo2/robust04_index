			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Markets Report: Russia dampens D-Mark The D-Mark weakened across the board on investors' increasing unease in the face of Russian radical nationalism and continued speculation over a possible cut in German interest rates this week, writes Conner Middelmann. After initially shrugging off the strong gains of Russia's right-wing Liberal Democratic party at Sunday's Russian elections, currency traders mulled over the implications of right-wing leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky's victory. News agency reports that Mr Zhirinovsky was threatening Germany and Japan with nuclear attacks caused market jitters. However, it later transpired that the reports were based on comments he had made to a Hamburg based radio station in 1991 which were repeated by that station in a programme last Sunday. 'I was surprised the D-Mark did not react to the Russian news on Monday, but (yesterday) it may have overreacted,' said Ms Wendy Niffikeer, senior economist with IBJ International in London. 'At this level, Germany is a buy,' said Mr Brian Hilliard, senior international economist at SGST in London. 'The market reaction to the Russian developments is understandable, but not really justified.' Further undermining the D-Mark was continuing speculation that the Bundesbank's central bank council would reduce interest rates at its meeting tomorrow. Bundesbank president Hans Tietmeyer's confirmation that the council meeting would be followed by a press conference gave the dollar a brief fillip. Mr Tietmeyer said the purpose of the briefing would be to announce the M3 money supply target for 1994, but some traders were hoping that it would be taken as an opportunity to announce a cut in interest rates. The Bundesbank in its latest monthly report, published yesterday, said that it had made increasing use of fixed-rate securities repurchase agreements to quell excessive speculation of easing. On December 2 it announced it would hold fixed-rate repos at 6 per cent until January 5, the day before the first council meeting in the new year. None the less, a survey by market analysis company IDEA revealed that some 40 per cent of market participants still expect the Bundesbank to lower its 5.75 per cent discount rate by 50 basis points on technical grounds to widen the present 25 basis-point gap between the repo rate and the discount rate. Ultimately, whether the Bundesbank cuts rates tomorrow or not should make little difference to the markets. 'The important rate cut - the recent  1/4 percentage point cut in the repo rate - has already taken place; only a move that will affect money market rates will have a lasting impact,' said IBJ's Ms Niffikeer. With repos fixed at 6 per cent, even a cut in the discount rate would have little affect on money market rates. Nervousness over the Russian political situation and continued German rate cut hopes pushed the US dollar to a high of DM1.7175. However, it eased back on slightly weaker than expected US retail sales numbers to end at DM1.7135, up from DM1.7050 on Monday. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar rose to Y109.35, from Y108.95 on Monday. In New York the US currency finished at DM1.7146 and Y109.37. Comments from senior US trade representative Mickey Kantor that the US and the European Union had resolved their trade differences, paving the way to a Gatt world trade treaty by its deadline tonight, had little impact on the currency markets. 'A Gatt settlement was pretty much priced in,' said a senior currency dealer in London. Dogged by the Russian worries, the D-Mark also lost ground against most currencies in the ERM. The French franc ended at FFr3.422 to the D-Mark, unchanged from Monday's close but off the high of FFr3.4140 seen during the day. The Belgian franc finished at BFr20.86 per D-Mark, up from BFr20.94 on Monday, while the Danish krone climbed to DKr3.916, from DKr3.923 the previous day. Among the southern European currencies, the Spanish peseta rose to Pta81.69 per D-Mark, from Pta81.91 on Monday, and the Italian lira ended at L987.1, up from L989.4. Sterling had another strong day, helped by the D-Mark's weakness but also underpinned by a slightly bullish survey from the Confederation of British Industry. The pound closed at DM2.5500, up from DM2.5425 after hitting a high of DM2.5530. Against the US dollar it ended at Dollars 1.4885, down from Monday's Dollars 1.4905. Meanwhile, the sterling money market remained very tight, causing the overnight rate to jump as high as 18 per cent in afternoon dealings, traders said. A senior money dealer added: 'The tightness from last week's gilts sale is still overhanging the market.' The Bank of England announced a shortage of Pounds 1.5bn which was later revised to Pounds 1.6bn. In early operations it bought bills totalling Pounds 200m for resale to the market on January 5 and 6 at 5 13/32 per cent. In further operations it purchased bills amounting to Pounds 24m at 5 3/8 per cent, followed by Pounds 388m at the same rate. Finally, the Bank provided late assistance of some Pounds 790m. Traders will be looking to today's release of November retail price and sales data for further clues of inflation trends and whether these might permit base rate cuts.</p>

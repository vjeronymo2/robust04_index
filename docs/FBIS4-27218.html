			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- A Japanese Government  advisory panel on Tuesday [31 May] proposed a three-stage scheme  to build a nationwide optical-fiber telecommunications network  by 2010 as part of efforts to facilitate the shift to an  information-oriented society in the next century.    The scheme would create jobs for 2.43 million people by  boosting Japan's multimedia market by 56 trillion yen to 123  trillion yen by the targeted year, said the Telecommunications  Council, an advisory body to the posts minister.    The council said the telecom project would help correct the  over- centralization of information in Tokyo, quicken economic  restructuring in Japan through the creation of new business and  expand leisure time of the Japanese people as a result of an  expected diffusion of "satellite" remote offices.    The scheme is also designed for the efficient use of natural  resources and energy, contributing to a solution of  environmental issues, one of the biggest global problems toward  the 21st century.    In the recommendation presented to Posts and  Telecommunications Minister Katsuyuki Hikasa, the council called  for the laying of a core optical-cable network linking the  prefectural capitals by 2000, in a first-phase project that  would cover 20 percent of the nation's population.    A second-stage network should be built by 2005 to connect  cities with populations of over 100,000 for a population  coverage of 60 percent, the council said.    Nationwide hookup is set for the year of 2010 when Japan's  population is expected to peak, it said.    Apart from the three-stage scheme, an optical cable network  to link major public organs, like schools, libraries, hospitals  and welfare facilities, should be built by 2000, accompanied by  the development of application software for use at such  institutions, the council said.    "Based on the council proposal, the posts ministry will push  for various measures to implement the program, including further  deregulation in telecom fields and an ample amount of budgetary  allocation by the Finance Ministry, an official at the posts  ministry told a press conference.    Tuesday's proposal has been apparently prompted by "the  information superhighway scheme" unveiled earlier by the United  States.    As under the U.S. scheme, the Japanese project is expected  to  provide a wide range of multimedia services in the next century,  which the council says would make Japanese people's livelihood  "dramatically more comfortable."    As possible multimedia services under the scheme, the  council  cited remote medical checking, video-on-demand services, home  shopping, electronic libraries, virtual reality leisure parks,  interactive access to administrative information and remote  education services.    The proposed optical-fiber network is projected to cost 53  trillion yen when the single-star (SS) system, the most  sophisticated optical cable networking method, is used at  subscribing companies and households, the council said.    The cost would be lower at 33 trillion yen if networking is  done with a combination of the SS system and a less  sophisticated system, a more practical approach in view of  Japan's current technological level.    The council said the private sector should play a key role  in  developing related application software. But government support  is also necessary in the inititial stage of networking that  focuses on infrastructure improvement.    The task of laying the core part of the fiber cable network  should be basically entrusted to either telecommunications  companies like Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) or  cable television operators, the council said.    The posts ministry official avoided stating a specific role  by NTT in the fiber project, noting that further discussion  needs to be conducted to decide who should take charge of the  task.    "To create a business environment that maximizes competition  among various sectors would eventually serve the interest of  general users," the council said.    It said interest-free loans and tax incentives should be  provided to entities participating in costly infrastructure  improvement projects in the scheme.    The optical-fiber network scheme is most likely to produce  various social, legal and security problems that the Japanese  people have rarely experienced in the past -- those uniquely  inherent in the nature of multimedia services.    Among them are an unintended violation of individual privacy  and intellectual property rights. The legal framework should be  upgraded to cope with these problems, the council said.    The council also called for the standardization of telecom  equipment and systems in accordance with international standards.    The concept of "universal services" should be introduced for  the new telecom scheme, in which services are equally offered  across the nation at reasonable prices, the council said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] An official spokesman has stated the following:    The Iraqi intelligence services have acquired documented and  serious information regarding the incident of the explosion at  the World Trade Center in New York.    This information raises many suspicions about the parties  that took part in or were behind the incident.    The competent Iraqi authorities are willing to cooperate  with  the United States to learn the facts as they exist. We hope  that the U.S. side that handles this will be impartial. It is  preferable that this should be done with the knowledge of the  U.S. Congress or under its supervision.</p>

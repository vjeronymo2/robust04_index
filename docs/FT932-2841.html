			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Rule changes for open-ended funds ACTIVE LOBBYING by the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds has been rewarded by three government concessions on the taxation and structure of open-ended investment funds. First, an anomaly introduced in the March Budget by the changes to advance corporation tax (ACT) is to be removed by an amendment to the 1993 Finance Bill now going through parliament. The ACT changes in the Budget threatened to impose, in an unintended way, extra taxation on life assurance companies and other corporate owners of unit trusts. As life companies own unit trusts worth some Pounds 30bn, or 40 per cent of the total funds assets of the unit trust industry, they might have been forced to liquidate their holdings. Now, a 'streaming' arrangement will permit UK company dividends to be taxed differently from other income, including interest on deposits or bonds. As a result life companies will pay no extra tax. The same streaming device is to be used to permit unit trusts to pay interest and other non-UK dividend income to foreign investors without deduction of tax. Legislation for this is promised by the Treasury for the next Finance Bill, due towards the end of the year. The move will enable UK unit trust companies to market bond funds and money funds (but not equity funds) to non-UK residents on a more equal footing to companies based in low-tax centres such as Luxembourg and Dublin. The third concession is a commitment to issue a discussion document before the end of the year on the introduction of open-ended investment companies.</p>

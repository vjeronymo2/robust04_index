			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Lamont holds out hopes of further interest rate cuts: Policy making set to become more open MR Norman Lamont, the chancellor, last night reinforced the government's new commitment to growth and outlined a more open approach to policy making. He also held out the prospect of further interest rate cuts. While he said no risks would be taken with the long-term anti-inflation goal, the government had 'no desire to see interest rates any higher than necessary'. Mr John Major also promised, in a cryptic reference during his speech to the Conservative 1922 committee last night, a 'package of measures' with next month's Autumn Statement that would raise morale on the Tory backbenches. While party officials refused to expand on Mr Major's words, his pledge raised speculation that rate cuts might be imminent. Mr Lamont used the traditional Mansion House speech - delivered last night at Guildhall - to place capital spending programmes at the top of the government's public expenditure priorities in 1993-94. The chancellor also promised to take industry's interests into account as part of a 'rebalancing' of policy 'to give greater weight to securing an early resumption of growth'. 'We cannot press a button and see the economy spring to life,' he said. 'But we can examine every development, every policy option, every idea and ask ourselves - does this support industry? Will it help confidence? Will this get the economy going? That is what we shall be doing in the weeks and months ahead.' Mr Lamont's speech marked a significant shift in Treasury rhetoric towards the pro-growth policies outlined by Mr Major last week. But the chancellor insisted the government had not 'gone soft on inflation' and reaffirmed its target of keeping underlying inflation in a 1 to 4 per cent range during this parliament. The details of the government's spending plans and proposals to give the private sector a bigger role in financing capital projects will be announced in the Autumn Statement on November 12. But, as one of a series of policy presentation reforms, Mr Lamont announced that government accounts would be drawn up to make a 'proper distinction' between current and capital transactions from the first unified Budget, covering spending and revenue raising, in December 1993. This, he said, would 'help to underpin the government's commitment to infrastructure investment in the longer term'. The chancellor's other steps to make the government's actions more accountable and transparent followed the shift to more discretionary policy making after Britain's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism. In view of the Treasury's poor record of forecasting the economy, the chancellor said he would set up an independent forecasting panel which would help inform Treasury decisions. He also said that in future: The chancellor will publish a monthly monetary report following his regular meetings with the governor of the Bank of England. Apart from 'certain market-sensitive items' this would set out the information on which policy judgments are based showing 'the bad news with the good'. The Treasury will give reasons for interest rate changes after they are made, as it did after the cut in base rates to 8 per cent on October 16. The Bank will publish regular reports in its quarterly bulletin on how well the government is meeting its inflation objective. Mr Lamont made no changes to existing rules for funding the public sector borrowing requirement. He disclosed that monetary policy will take prospective rather than current inflation as its guide because monetary changes take time to take effect. He also made clear that the government would not ignore the sterling exchange rate in judging policy following Britain's departure from the ERM. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, criticised Mr Lamont's speech for containing no new measures to reverse the decline of the economy. He said: 'Nothing less than a national recovery programme will be enough to bring the economy successfully out of recession and to achieve sustainable growth.' The plan should include an interest rate cut now, an emergency employment programme, an effective industrial policy, and 'immediate initiation of Europe-wide measures to expand the economy'.

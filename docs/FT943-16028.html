			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / International Company News: Success for Italian investors in Ina sell-off All 418,000 Italian private investors who applied for shares in Ina, the former state-owned insurance company, will receive some or all of the shares they asked for, making it the first Italian privatisation not to leave at least some prospective small shareholders empty-handed. The shares will begin trading today in Milan, London and New York, and the scale of market activity - and whether the shares rise to a premium over the L2,400 offer price - is likely to be taken as a gauge of the success of the issue. The sale is the largest Italian privatisation to date, and one of the biggest in Europe in the past three years. Advisers yesterday played down the fact that the offer was not as heavily subscribed as previous Italian privatisations. They pointed out that it was the second most popular Italian sell-off in terms of the number of public applications, and was much bigger than previous sales of stakes in financial institutions Credito Italiano, Banca Commerciale Italiana (BCI) and IMI. If the Italian treasury, which formerly owned 100 per cent of Ina, later decides to release 260m additional shares held in reserve to meet additional demand, then the sale will raise more than L5,000bn to help reduce Italy's public debt. The sale of these shares to underwriters would bring to 53.5 per cent the stake sold by the government, against the 51 per cent originally promised to the market. Public demand for the Ina shares was probably affected by the treasury's rash declarations at the end of the first day of last week's offer that the issue was 'sold out', a move which is thought to have deterred applicants. Recent stock market turbulence may also have helped to dampen demand. BCI, privatised earlier this year, was particularly popular, with nearly 1m applications from the public, of which less than 200,000 were rewarded with shares.</p>

			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Improving margins aid Calderburn An improvement in margins limited the fall in first half pre-tax profit at Calderburn, the office furniture and related products group formed through the merger of Alan Cooper and Mayfield in July 1991. Pre-tax profit came to Pounds 2.21m (Pounds 2.3m) and operating surplus to Pounds 2.17m (Pounds 2.19m) on turnover of Pounds 14.9m (Pounds 16.5m). Improved margins stemmed from action taken on the cost base in 1991 and benefits of the reorganisation following the merger. 'The results are as we had expected despite a further fall in the office furniture market', said Mr James Blyth Currie, chairman. And he warned: 'Since no recovery in our marketplace seems likely this year, profits for the second half can reasonably be expected to be lower than in the first six months'. Earnings per share were 5.7p (5.8p), and the interim dividend is again 2.8p.</p>

			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Construction Contracts: Malaysian rail development TAYLOR WOODROW INTERNATIONAL and AEG WESTINGHOUSE TRANSPORT SYSTEME GmbH have secured authority from the Malaysian government to proceed with a project to promote a light rail transit system for Kuala Lumpur. The project, running 12 kilometres between Ampang, on the eastern outskirts of the city, and Jalan Sultan Ismail in the city centre, is to be privately funded through a combination of equity and loans. To raise the required finance for the Pounds 300m system, the two companies, operating in consortium, have formed an operating company STAR (Sistem Transit Aliran Ringan), which has entered a franchise agreement with the Malaysian government to raise investment capital for developing Phase 1. The consortium formed the STAR company around a year ago to own and operate the LRT system within the terms of the franchise agreement. The other principal organisation involved in the project is the Kuala Lumpur Transit Group Sdn Bhd (KLTG), owned equally by TWI and AEG, which has entered into contract with STAR to undertake the design, engineering, construction, delivery, installation and testing of the LRT system. Discussions are now taking place with various financial institutions in Malaysia. Once funding is secured, work on the 34-month construction programme is expected to start next spring. About a quarter of the total project value is expected to come from shareholdings and the remainder from loan facilities, including a Malaysian government support loan. The project represents the first phase of an integrated light rail network for Kuala Lumpur and surrounding areas, reflecting the urgent need for a modern, reliable and convenient non-road based public transport system to overcome the congestion caused by the rapid growth in motor traffic over recent years. The proposed route will serve the urban and suburban commuter Phase 1 areas of Ampang, Cheras, Petaling Jaya and Kepong. The total estimated project cost includes a fixed-price contract with KLTG of some 950m ringgits (Pounds 245m), subject to final terms and conditions.</p>

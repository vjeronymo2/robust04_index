			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Gennadiy Yezhov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 25 TASS -- Bashkortostan became on  Wednesday the second republic after its neighbouring Tatarstan  to sign a power-sharing treaty with Moscow.    The signing ceremony crowned a final round of negotiations  between Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin and Bashkir  President Murtaza Rakhimov.    The package of signed documents includes agreements on  economic cooperation, on foreign trade, on sharing powers in  defence industries and state property ownership, on crime  fighting and environment protection among others.    Drafted agreements on budget and banking relations remained  unsigned as the parties failed to reach compromise in these  fields.</p>

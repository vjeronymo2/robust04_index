			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with the head of the Moscow Center for Arms </F> Control, Anatoliy Dyakov, by Andrzey Rybak; place and date not  given: ``Still Under Control'']    [Text]    Rybak: Russia stores some 180 tonnes of  weapons-grade plutonium, which is enough to produce 90,000  nuclear warheads. But the Russians go on producing plutonium.  Why?    Dyakov: This situation is far from logical to me  also. Three reactors--two in Tomsk, one in Krasnoyarsk--are  still producing weapons-grade plutonium. But they also generate  electricity. If they were closed down, many people would be  without electricity and heating. Yet, the government says there  is another reason as well: The fuel used in the reactors cannot  be stored for a long period. It has to be processed if even  greater risks to humans and the environment are to be avoided.    Rybak: Russia is in the midst of an economic  crisis. Does this have an effect on the destruction of nuclear  weapons, as laid down in the START Treaties?    Dyakov: This is, indeed, a major financial  problem. A total of 30,000 nuclear warheads are to be  destroyed. Storing one gram of plutonium costs between $1 and  $2 per year. The warheads contain a total of 60 tonnes of  plutonium. This means that storing them alone would cost $60 to  $120 million a year. The entire nuclear complex consumes some  $1.5 billion per year. Using about 20 percent of capacity for  disarmament would cost some $300 million per year. And the work  will take 10 to 15 years.    Rybak: The United States promised Russia financial  support for disarmament.    Dyakov: There is a $800 million fund. But this  has been almost completely exhausted.    Rybak: The rich threshold countries are very much  interested in Russian nuclear scientists. How big is the danger  that they might sell their knowledge?    Dyakov: I, personally, do not know of any  scientist of the ``inner circle'' who has emigrated to these  countries.    Rybak: But an increasing number of them lose their  jobs. Scientists at the secret nuclear complex Arzamas-16 were  on strike recently because their salaries had not been paid.    Dyakov: The scientists' situation is very bleak.  But I do not think this will lead to mass migration.    Rybak: In Germany and Poland there have been  several cases of smugglers being arrested with nuclear material.    Dyakov: This was only slightly enriched uranium  that is not suitable for weapons. As to the military nuclear  complex, the situation is still under control.    Rybak: Corruption is on the increase within the  Russian Army. All kinds of weapons are being stolen and sold.  Why not nuclear weapons?    Dyakov: Your concern is justified. If everybody  steals, including government personnel, you cannot expect the  Army to be any better.    Rybak: The Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty will  expire in 1995. What will happen then?    Dyakov: I think that the Treaty will simply be  extended. I hope that we will finally achieve a ban on tests.    Rybak: In spite of the Nonproliferation Treaty,  Iraq and North Korea have almost finished developing the bomb.  How can such things be prevented in the future?    Dyakov: We have to put heavy pressure on such  countries, impose economic sanctions. But we must also stop  discriminating against the threshold countries. We cannot  modernize our arsenals and prohibit them from developing the  bomb. The First World must set an example by completely  destroying its nuclear weapons.</p>

Streets have been closed off since this  morning, and tension has prevailed in the suburbs. We do not  know everything that has been damaged, but it has been said that  houses have been burned in Musaga. For this reason, the  secretary of state for security and the interim minister for  territorial administration and communal development, Lieutenant  Colonel Gakoryo Lazare, gave the following address on today's  events.    [Begin Gakoryo recording] Today, 31 January, the peace was  disturbed in Bujumbura because of roadblocks preventing people  from reporting to work and going to the markets and preventing  shops from opening. Yesterday evening, leaflets telling people  not to work were distributed in bars and houses. Very early  this morning, youths began to erect roadblocks on some Bujumbura  streets, especially in Ngagara, Musaga, Kinanira, and Kanyosha.    This has led to the following problems: Work has come to a  halt, in both the government and private sector; markets were  not well attended, therefore most families did not buy goods;  almost all vehicles were at a halt, especially in the morning,  so very few people could move from one area to another and the  sick could not be taken to hospital; ethnic tension erupted,  especially in the zones of Musaga and Kinanira.    But peace is slowly returning this evening. Extensive damage  has been reported. Some houses were either demolished or burned  in Musaga and Kinanira. Goods were looted due to the tension  that prevailed in the aforementioned suburbs. There are reports  of deaths and injuries. [passage omitted] [end recording]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lao </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by National Assembly Chairman Saman Vi-gnaket at a </F> banquet in honor of the visiting Thai parliamentary delegation  in Vientiane on 1 February -- recorded]    [Text] On behalf of myself and the multiethnic Lao people,  my wife and I are very proud to have the honor of welcoming Your  Excellency the President [Thai Parliamentary President Marut  Bunnak], your wife, and your party. We regard your high-level  visit to our country as a good omen for friendly relations  between the Lao and Thai peoples, especially between our two  legislative institutions. We firmly believe that the successful  talks held this afternoon in an atmosphere of friendship and  mutual understanding will be an important factor in building and  strengthening the time-honored, fine, traditional relations  between Laos and Thailand.    Your Excellency, ladies, gentlemen, and distinguished  quests:  The ties between the Lao and Thai peoples are based on a spirit  of close brotherliness and neighborliness that has existed  traditionally since ancient times. This was noted in the speech  by His Majesty King Phumiphon Adunyadet the Great at a banquet  in honor of His Excellency [H.E.] Kaysone Phomvihan, president  of the Lao People's Democratic Republic [LPDR], on 6 January  1992. The king observed: Relations between our states and  peoples are so close that they have become inseparable; this  bond makes us close relatives. In his speech at the same  banquet, H.E. President Kaysone Phomvihan said: It is clear  that if we uphold the spirit of close brotherliness and  neighborliness, avoid developing a sense of animosity and ill  intentions toward each other, and firmly adhere to the teachings  of the Lord Buddha and the five principles of peaceful  coexistence, we can be certain that any conflict between Laos  and Thailand will be resolved.    In this spirit, and in our capacity as the legislative  organizations of the two countries, I believe we will continue  to encourage all concerned sectors to solve the problems between  our countries. This will keep our relations smooth forever and  further deepen the affection and solidarity between the  fraternal Lao and Thai peoples.    On this auspicious occasion, I invite Your Excellency the  President, your wife, your party, and all our distinguished  guests to make a toast: To the happiness of His Majesty King  Phumiphon Adunyadet the Great, her majesty the queen, and all  the members of the Royal Family of the Kingdom of Thailand; the  good health of His Excellency LPDR President Nouhak Phoumsavan;  the health and happiness of Your Excellency the President, your  wife, and your party; the health of all the ladies, gentlemen,  and distinguished guests at this banquet; and the health and  prosperity of the Lao and Thai peoples.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Carlos F. Chamorro] </F>   [Text] To those who take a traditional approach to party  politics, any possibility of renewing the program, bylaws, and  leadership of the FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front] is  subordinate to the higher objective of preserving internal  unity. Under different historical circumstances, this approach,  when the party was in power, enforced discipline in the FSLN,  and unity set a limit on change. Now, however, when we are in  the opposition, we cannot afford not to change. Unity, which is  misunderstood as an end in itself, is ceasing to be a vehicle  for change and is winding up as a straitjacket on thinking. This  restrictive approach has given rise to the mistaken attempt to  build a revolutionary party in the image and likeness of its own  apparatus, but behind the back of its huge constituency. This  was the predominant trend at the recent assemblies in Masaya and  Leon, where the pursuit of sectarian dominance in the name of  unity emerged.    The other proposal in Sandinism is to struggle for unity by  bringing the FSLN and its responsibilities before society. From  this perspective the challenge is not to maintain unity in the  abstract but rather to adapt the party so that it brings  together the majority of Sandinists who are now scattered: to  unite, open up, and grow, and to design a political strategy  that, from the existing spheres of power and the spheres yet to  be developed in civil society, will enable us to forge alliances  and broaden the involvement and influence of grassroots sectors.    We live in times of ongoing crisis. The famous ESAF is  tantamount to three straight years of an explosive socioeconomic  situation. Opposing the IMF's economic program requires a  Sandinism that can take effective action amid the dynamics of  all segments of society: peasants, unions, associations of  producers and businessmen, consumers, the unemployed, women,  young people, professionals, etc. It demands a party that places  respect for the autonomy of social and union movements before  the temptation of a vanguard to direct all struggles by remote  control through a Staff. Above all, it demands a leadership that  in its commitment to accompany and support the just struggles of  the people, takes up before the people, the responsibility to  exert its influence to do away with violent methods of struggle.  Nothing has damaged Sandinism's political credibility more than  its ambiguity about condemning violence.    Moreover, we are facing a crisis of credibility in all  national and state political institutions, and no definite end  to polarization is in sight. The greatest danger is that while  Aleman's right-wing authoritarian agenda has already become an  electoral option, the FSLN remains trapped in the painful  process of shedding its skin.  <H5>  Lessons and Options </H5>   A great deal of the shilly-shallying reflected in the  current  high-flown debate can be clarified in light of the recent  election campaign along the Atlantic Coast and its outcome.    The elections along the coast erased Sandinism's false  dichotomies in one fell swoop: Is it a revolutionary or an  electoral party? Is it leftist or Social Democrat? Should it win  votes or minds? Should it be an opposition party or a government  partner? Should it wage a grass-roots or a congressional  struggle?    The FSLN set out to be a winning electoral party, albeit  without full cognizance or nationwide consistency, and it  failed. It reaffirmed that elections are the only legitimate  path to power (even though some still privately deny this fact)  but it did not succeed in putting together a victorious  strategy. And in the end, even though it was defeated, Sandinism  is still struggling tenaciously to influence the composition and  program of the regional governments in order to stem the  influence and control of the right. There, as in the rest of the  country, the Front does not want to be in the opposition forever.    There are those, however, who cling to the ideological view  that the quality and political awareness of votes is more  important than their number in realizing the desire for power.  But if we want to attack the structural roots of poverty and  social injustice, we must all acknowledge that votes do indeed  add up and are decisive in setting any government program in  motion.    Sandinism must become convinced that what happened in the  1990 national election must not be repeated in 1996. It is one  thing to lose power and become the leading political force in a  country; it would be another thing, and a catastrophic one, to  lose again and become the number two or three electoral force.  That would condemn the FSLN to the status of a party that  repeatedly loses, a true minority party that might be very  cohesive ideologically but that would be less and less able to  influence the destiny of the nation and the defense of the  people's interests.    This is why I feel that the FSLN's most important goal, with  the backing or in spite of the Special Congress, is to lay the  groundwork for a political strategy, marked by an electoral  approach, to sway a majority and gain power in 1996. Only a  program of renewal that can get the FSLN moving again through  viable proposals to society and through a credible leadership,  will be able to do this. I wonder: How else can the FSLN capture  the imagination of a million new young voters in 1996?    It is altogether untrue that it is too early to place this  item on the agenda. We need only acknowledge how much headway  the right's platform has made to realize that we are far behind.  And the only way to begin closing the gap is to place  Sandinism's true options before it: not the false dilemma of  unity or division, but rather the choice between renewal now and  certain political defeat in 1996. There is no other way.</p>

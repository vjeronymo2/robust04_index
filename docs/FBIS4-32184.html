			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, June 18 (ATA) -- During its stay in Kosova,  the delegation of the CSCE Parliamentary Assembly, headed by  Frank Savailen, speaker of the Belgian Senate, also met with the  representatives of the Council for the Defence of Human Rights  and Freedoms in Pristina.    The chairman of this council, Adem Demaci, stressed in his  talks with the CSCE delegation that the political and repressive  actions of the present Serb regime against the Albanians are  public actions, and in most cases sanctioned by the Serb laws,  such as the Law on Kosova's Colonization, and on Banning the  Sale and Purchase of Real Property Among Different Nationalities.    Demaci also familiarized the CSCE delegation with the daily  Serb police and military violence against Albanians, murdering  and wounding them without any cause.</p>

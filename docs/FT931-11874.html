			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / Small companies 'more confident' BRITAIN'S independent companies are increasingly confident about business prospects in the UK, according to a survey of 1,000 companies by 3i, the investment capital group. The survey, conducted earlier this month, reports the highest level of confidence among small and medium-sized independent companies since autumn 1988. They were, however, less optimistic about their own immediate sales prospects. Forecasts for turnover during the next three months in the south have deteriorated slightly, though the picture is more hopeful among companies in the north. Even so, companies in all regions say that they expect their profitability to rise over the next three months. In the October survey, 37 per cent of respondents expected profitability to fall but the figure has now dropped to 25 per cent. Mr Ewen Macpherson, chief executive of 3i, said the survey suggested that companies had their cost bases under control and were managing to maintain margins in the competitive environment. He added: 'This is a pointer to really healthy growth as the economy picks up. The danger at the end of a recession is that businesses have been so weakened financially that they simply cannot seize market opportunities.' The survey also shows that companies are preparing to at least maintain, or raise, investment. The number of businesses planning to cut their investment had fallen from more than a third since the October survey to 17 per cent. More than a fifth expected to increase employment this year. The expected increase in numbers employed was 4.5 per cent. Most of the businesses surveyed said they expected the devaluation of the pound to have a detrimental effect on the cost of materials, and 8 per cent expected it to have a strong effect on wage demands. Among exporters, a third said the devaluation of sterling had influenced their plans for growth, although more than half believed it would make little difference to strategy. Just over 10 per cent felt that devaluation would be bad for the growth of their companies. Half the companies said that the government's increases in public expenditure and infrastructure investment would help their business. Enterprise Barometer. 3i, 91 Waterloo Road, London SE1 8XP.

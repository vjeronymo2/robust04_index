			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: US economy So far it looks as though the strong personal income/consumer spending patterns and weak output/employment trends which marked the first quarter in the US will be reversed in the second three months. While yesterday's jump in the widely watched US purchasing managers' index for May to some extent merely makes up ground lost in April, the advance is nevertheless consistent with a relatively robust manufacturing recovery. It also suggests that the US is well ahead of the UK at this stage in the cycle. All six components showed good gains, with the employment number bolstering hopes that Friday's eagerly awaited official May job statistics will show an improvement.</p>

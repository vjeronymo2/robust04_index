			<p><P> November 23, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> CLUB MEETING TO FOCUS ON SOVIET UFOS  </P> <P> The day after the all-American celebration of Thanksgiving, Dan Campbell of  Camarillo will turn his attention to more distant lands.  </P> <P> Campbell, a founding member of the Ventura Chapter of the Mutual Unidentified  Flying Object Network, will show a video about UFO activity in the Soviet Union  at the club's meeting at 7:30 tonight at the Camarillo Library.  </P> <P> "In the network, we're not interested in the tabloid-type sensationalism  surrounding UFOs," Campbell said. "What we want is to assimilate and provide  information and to keep a scientific outlook on UFOs. I'd say about 98% of  sightings can be explained by ordinary events. But I keep an open mind to the  other 2%."  </P> <P> Tonight's meeting, which is free and open to the public, will feature a speech  about UFO activity. Headquartered in Texas, the UFO network has chapters  throughout the world.  </P> <P> Campbell said that organizers hope to hold meetings once a month after the  holidays. In the future, he said, the club will provide training sessions for  people who want to become UFO investigators.  </P> <P> Campbell say his interest in UFOs stems from an incident that occurred about 13  years ago.  </P> <P> "I stepped out my front door and there was this big red light just hanging over  Thousand Oaks," he said. "At first I thought it was a plane, but it didn't  move. And then I saw helicopters and other activity coming from Point Mugu. The  red light moved north and then made an abrupt turn west and flew right over my  house. All I could see was a red streak, it was going so fast. I don't know if  it was an alien ship. I don't know if it wasn't. All I know is that I'm curious  and that I'd like more information."  </P> <P> Campbell, 58, said, "There seems to be pretty many sightings in Ventura County,  but a lot of people don't talk about it freely, out of fear of being  ridiculed."

			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / International Company News: Mercedes-Benz slaughters a sacred cow - The car manufacturer's decision to adopt a new pricing policy MERCEDES-BENZ, one of the world's most prestigious and tradition-laden carmakers, has taken its time to wake up to the daunting dimensions of the challenges it faces in the rapidly-changing world car market of the 1990s. But the Mercedes juggernaut is finally rolling. It arrived publicly at the starting line yesterday with an agenda for change which will astonish the rest of the world car industry. With a breathtaking abandonment of its traditional air of arrogance, the company set out a strategy for change aimed at transforming its fortunes and position in the world car market by the end of the decade. The bearer of the dramatic tidings was Mr Helmut Werner, the 56-year-old former tyre industry executive who takes over officially as Mercedes-Benz chief executive on May 27 from the long-serving Mr Werner Niefer. He joined Daimler-Benz in 1987 from Continental, the tyremaker. Mr Werner, a potential candidate for the chairmanship of Daimler-Benz when Mr Edzard Reuter retires in the mid-1990s, revealed that the new Mercedes-Benz management team was now ready to challenge virtually all of the most dearly-held tenets of one of the world's most exclusive carmakers. There are to be no more sacred cows in Stuttgart. The company has accepted that radical changes in the world car market mean that Mercedes-Benz will no longer be able to demand premium prices for its products based on an image of effortless superiority and a content of the ultimate in automotive engineering. With a disarming frankness - and a devastating attack on Mercedes-Benz's most recent past - Mr Werner admitted that if the company were to continue to 'over-engineer' its products it would be 'priced-out' of its markets. In order to avoid this 'trap' the company has decided to turn on its head its whole product development strategy. Instead of developing the ultimate car and then charging a correspondingly sky-high price as in the past, Mercedes-Benz is taking the dramatic and radical step of moving to 'target pricing'. It will decide what the customer is willing to pay in a particular product category - priced against its competitors - it will add its profit margin and then the real work will begin to cost every part and component to bring in the vehicle at the target price. Such an approach is not entirely new. Chrysler has begun to use it to great effect to fuel its renaissance in the US, but at Mercedes-Benz this is the stuff of revolution. At the same time Mercedes-Benz is aiming to transform its range of product offerings by the end of the decade, changing from being 'a car manufacturer with a long tradition in the luxury class' to become an 'exclusive full-line manufacturer offering high quality vehicles in all segments of the market.' Mr Werner disclosed that Mercedes would add to its present three car ranges during the 1990s with a small 'city car,' possibly with electric propulsion as one variant, a 'people carrier' in the mode of the Renault Espace, and a modern four-wheel drive leisure/utility vehicle. The people carrier, or multi-purpose vehicle, is closest to the market and would be launched by late 1994 or early 1995, said Mr Werner. The vehicle, code-named T0, will be built in Vitoria in Spain. The company is planning to invest DM356m (Dollars 226m) in Spain, and the capacity of the plant will be expanded from 28,000 vehicles a year at present to around 60,000. The new vehicle will be produced in two variants, as a passenger-carrying MPV and as a light commercial vehicle to replace the present MB-100 van. Mercedes is thus joining the fight in what promises to become one of the most fiercely contested segments of the European car market in the second half of the 1990s. Fiat and Peugeot are developing a plant for a rival vehicle in northern France, while Ford and Volkswagen are co-operating on a similar vehicle to be built at a jointly-owned plant in Portugal. Mr Werner said that Mercedes-Benz's new direction was being forced by a conviction that 'radical changes in the structure of the car market had necessitated the strategic reorientation of the company.' According to Mr Werner, 'the traditional vertical market structure defined by engine size is increasingly giving way to a horizontal market structure. 'Under the influence of factors such as stricter traffic and environmental requirements and a growing subjective component in vehicle use, the division of the market into luxury class, medium class and small cars is becoming less and less meaningful.' With a proliferation of niche vehicles such as MPVs, off-road vehicles and roadsters, it was body shapes and forms of propulsion that were becoming the more important distinguishing features, rather than engine size and performance. 'Mercedes-Benz has to gear itself to a future market structured primarily around a diversity in vehicle concepts rather than around engine prestige value,' he said. As car buyers forsake the conspicuous consumption of the 1980s and place more stress on a vehicle's functional use than on its role as a status symbol, Mercedes is also beginning to investigate radical new ideas of 'car ownership' and of selling cars. By the late 1990s, Mr Werner suggested that personal car leasing programmes could be available, where the customer might have available several different vehicles during the year. The brave new world is not going to be won without pain and dislocation, however.</p>

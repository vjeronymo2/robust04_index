			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / Single market rigour pledged The European Commission yesterday promised 'decisive action' to force members of the European Union to implement all legislation on the barrier-free single European market by the end of next year. The Commission also launched a strategic programme of evaluation, consultation and legislation designed to maintain the momentum of the original 1985 internal market project. Mr Raniero Vanni d'Archirafi, internal market commissioner, said: 'It's no longer a 'softly softly' approach: there's balance, but there will be very decisive and very severe action (to enforce) the application at national level of this legislation.' When they meet in Brussels today for their last meeting of the year, internal market ministers will be told they face European Court action if laws are not implemented. Under new Maastricht treaty powers, the Commission can also recommend fines for such infringements. Mr Vanni d'Archirafi also said the Commission was prepared to press ahead next year with legislation aimed at ending all controls at internal frontiers. Britain, Denmark and Ireland have maintained certain passport controls at borders with other EU countries, while the other nine EU members have pledged to end all checks on February 1 next year. The strategic programme sets as a priority the implementation and adoption of legislation already proposed for the single market. But it also lays out a legislative and regulatory programme for the next two to three years, and seeks to counter criticism from some industry and consumer lobbies that the single market has not gone far enough. The Commission promises full consultation on new measures, which will include proposals to ease the administrative burden on small companies, introduce a definitive VAT system, and encourage private investment in trans-European infrastructure projects. But the document also contains a warning to member states not to question the Commission's powers to act in areas where it has 'a precise and indisputable obligation' to do so.</p>

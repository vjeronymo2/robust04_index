			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Hitachi and GE link up on lighting GENERAL Electric of the US and Hitachi, two of the world's biggest electrical and industrial combines, yesterday announced a lighting equipment joint-venture to be based in Tokyo. The two, which already co-operate in manufacturing heavy-duty power generation equipment, are to set up Hitachi GE Lighting, headed by a top GE executive in Japan, Mr Edward Neikeisel. It will provide GE with access to Hitachi's extensive Japanese network of distributors, while Hitachi will gain access to the US group's advanced lighting technology. The venture will be the principal route for sales of GE and Hitachi lights for commercial, industrial and automotive markets in Japan. GE said the venture would become a big importer of light bulbs into Japan via a specially designed import centre which will handle quality control and customer service. Hitachi will also be able to use the venture to export its lighting products via GE's overseas sales network.</p>

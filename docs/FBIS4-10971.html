			<p>BFN     [Text] Brasilia -- Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero  yesterday stated that the constitutional revision process is not  over yet, and announced that the government will make a major  effort this week with congressional leaders to effect a  turnaround before 31 May, the established deadline for the  conclusion of the Constituent Congress. Drawing a comparison  between the revision process and a soccer game, he said: "We  are perhaps already 20 minutes into the second half of the  soccer game, but we can still turn the game around." Speaking  during a news conference he called yesterday afternoon to  discuss the subject, he added: "I believe one is only truly  defeated when one considers oneself to have been defeated."    Ricupero urges a greater effort by those running for office  in the upcoming elections with a view to influencing the  constitutional revision process. He said: "Those candidates  who believe they are likely to win are the ones who should  undertake this effort." He voiced his belief that Itamar  Franco's government has already discharged its duty in this  regard. He added that the lack of structural reforms will  render the future government inoperative.    To make this turnaround possible, Ricupero announced that he  and four other ministers -- Planning Minister Beni Varas,  Industry and Commerce Minister Elcio Alvares, Justice Minister  Alexandre Dupeyrant, and Social Security Minister Sergio Cutolo  -- will have lunch on 19 April with all congressional bloc  leaders to establish those topics the government considers to be  essential for its economic reform.    Upon urging the virtual presidential candidates to support  the revision process, Ricupero mentioned the drafting of the  1996 budget, which he believes will be the first task the new  government will have to undertake. He said: "How will the new  government finance public accounts with all those restrictions  if it can no longer count on the Social Emergency Fund [FSE]?"  He noted that the FSE stemmed from an amendment approved by the  Constituent Congress, and that it will be valid for financing  social spending only in 1994 and 1995.    Ricupero stated that the government will not overlook  congressional authority in outlining the points of a possible  negotiated minimum agenda. He made it clear, however, that he  is going to fight to prioritize issues such as tax, fiscal, and  social security reform, as well as related restrictions. He  described issues such as the definition of national enterprise  and the opening up to foreign capital as important for Brazil's  future development.</p>

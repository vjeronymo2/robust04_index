			<p>BFN     [Text] Chinese ships, naval vessels included, will be  allowed to navigate Russian border rivers in the Khabarovsk  region's shores only in day time. Such a decision has been  taken by the regional administration, which, pending the  completion of appropriate bilateral diplomatic activity, imposed  new rules for navigation on the border rivers.    From now on the Chinese side must inform a Russian border  official about the number of ships, their names, and time of  their passage one day in advance of sailing. However, vessels  must keep clear of the shores, nor are they allowed to land  people, accept them or cargoes on board, catch fish or engage in  any research.    The Russian Foreign Ministry has been asked to speed up the  drafting of complete rules for sail by Chinese ships from the  Ussuri river into the Amur river and back.    As the commander of Naval Forces of the Russian Border  Troops, Vice-Admiral Nikolay Kudinov has told INTERFAX, the  issue on navigation on the Amur and Ussuri rivers will be  discussed during a visit to China by Russia's Premier Viktor  Chernomyrdin.    Last year's bilateral talks on the issue ended inclusively  [as received].</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 15 KYODO -- Ichiro Ozawa, the ruling  coalition's chief strategist, said Friday [15 April] that it is  much more important to form a stable government than to enact  the overdue state budget for fiscal 1994 that started April 1.    At a news conference, Ozawa said, "there are opinions urging  enactment of the budget but it is much more important to  establish a stable political structure through necessary  discussions."    Ozawa, secretary general of the coalition's core party  Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], has urged other coalition  components to cement agreement on such key issues as tax reform  and the stance toward North Korea's suspected nuclear program  before picking a successor to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa,  who on April 8 said he will step down.    Meanwhile, Hajime Funada, a senior Shinseito member, said  Friday that agreement on tax reform is the minimum requirement  for policy discussions that start Saturday among deputy heads of  coalition parties.    Speaking at a ceremony to commemorate the establishment of  the party's chapter in Ustunomiya, Tochigi Prefecture, Funada  also said that Shinseito will play a key role in selecting a  successor to Hosokawa.</p>

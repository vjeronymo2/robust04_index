			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] President Idriss Deby, who made a short working  visit to Nigeria this morning, has just returned home to  Ndjamena. During his visit he met with his Nigerian counterpart,  General Sani Abacha, in Abuja. On his return to Ndjamena, the  president was welcomed by the prime minister and other members  of his government. Let us listen to President Deby outlining the  purpose of his visit to Abuja:    [Begin recording] [Deby] We decided to pay a short visit to  Nigeria as part of the efforts to develop the friendly relations  of cooperation existing between both countries. This visit had  become necessary after the changes that took place in that  country and especially after the devaluation of the CFA franc in  our country. It must be noted that, as far as trade with Chad is  concerned, Nigeria is an extremely important country. Most of  the trade between the two countries takes place in an informal  way. We, therefore, decided to pay this visit to discuss all  these issues in order to formalize our commercial activities.  [passage omitted]    [Unidentified correspondent] Your Excellency, concerning the  devaluation of the CFA franc, in concrete terms, what economic  benefits can Chad expect from Nigeria?    [Deby] [Words indistinct] and even on this specific point,  Nigeria is an oil-producing country. We have great difficulties  in this specific field, so we expressed the wish to see Nigeria  helping us to procure this product. What we are expecting from  the Nigerian authorities is a positive reaction to our request.  [end recording]</p>

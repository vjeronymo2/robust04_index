			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Azak Karimov, member of the RT [Tatarstan </F> Republic] Constitutional Commission and candidate of juridical  sciences: "A Treaty Between Sovereign States"]    [Text] We continue publication of materials analyzing  the different aspects of the RF-RT [Russian Federation-Tatarstan  Republic] Treaty. Today we draw readers' attention to a skillful  juridical analysis of the document, together with a political  analysis.    The Treaty on Demarcation of Subjects of Jurisdiction and  Reciprocal Delegation of Powers Between Organs of State  Authority of the Russian Federation and Organs of State  Authority of the Tatarstan Republic, signed in Moscow on 15  February 1994, is an important landmark in our republic's  development as a sovereign state. It ranks with such documents  as the republic's Declaration of State Sovereignty of 30 August  1990 and the Tatarstan Republic Constitution of 6 November 1992.  It is the fundamental document in which the most important  questions in relations between our republic and the Russian  Federation are resolved. As I see it, this is also its main  purpose.    The treaty unquestionably will be the subject of intensive  research by historians, economists, jurists, and other  scientists. But even now a number of provisions may be pointed  out which characterize it as a document that is not only  original, but workable and equal to the Basic Law of the  Tatarstan Republic. The treaty's text attests to the fact that  the authorized representatives of Tatarstan were truly guided by  the Tatarstan Republic Constitution when they signed it. And the  entry on this in the treaty preamble was completely justified.    Confirmation of what has been stated may be seen in how  questions concerning relationships between laws of the Tatarstan  Republic and the Russian Federation on property, taxes, the  judicial system, citizenship, and so forth, were resolved in the  treaty. At the same time, of course, it is interesting to see  how the matters cited were resolved in the Federative Treaty,  which the Tatarstan Republic did not sign, as we know.    In the Federation, the relationship between the formal  documents of federal organs and the organs of Federation  subjects is what is most significant.    In the Federative Treaty, for example, the title paragraphs  of the article on the subjects of joint jurisdiction by the  Russian Federation and the republics which signed this treaty  are the paragraphs providing for conformity between the  constitutions and laws of the republics and the Constitution and  laws of the Russian Federation, legality, and law and order. It  also states there that on matters of joint jurisdiction, the  federal organs promulgate the fundamentals of the law, in  conformity with which the republics' organs of authority  promulgate their own law and other formal legal documents (Part  2, Article II).    There are no such provisions in the treaty between the  Tatarstan Republic and the Russian Federation.    Further. While disputes between organs of the RF and the  republics on matters of joint jurisdiction are resolved in  accordance with the Federative Treaty and the RF Constitutional  Court (Part 3, Article VI), disputes between RF and RT organs  "are resolved in a procedure coordinated between them" (RT-RF  Treaty, Part 3, Article VI). In the event that the sides adopt  laws which conflict with the treaty, the sides have the right to  appeal against them (Part 2, Article VI). In the Federative  Treaty, this matter is resolved by different means: if the  republics promulgate documents on matters of Russian Federation  jurisdiction, an offical act of the RF will come into force. It  also states there that RF organs may not promulgate documents on  matters related to the republics' jurisdiction. But what would  the consequences be if they did promulgate them anyway? This is  an open question.    Let us turn to property and tax matters.    The RT-RF Treaty, in conformity with the RT Constitution,  states that its organs of state authority independently "resolve  the problems of jurisdiction, use, and disposal of lands,  mineral resources, and water, forestry, and other natural  resources..." (Paragraph 6, Part 2, Article II). In other words,  the RT-RF Treaty confirms the exclusive right of the Tatarstan  Republic itself to dispose of the property owned by the people  of Tatarstan. Meanwhile, in the Federative Treaty and the RF  Constitution, these questions are grouped with joint  jurisdiction of the RF and the republics, with all the  consequences stemming from this.    The matter of taxes. Taxes are basic sources for the budget  of any state, and for this reason, it is important who sets them  and collects them. The RT-RF Treaty clearly differentiates  between the federal and republic (RT) taxes, which are set and  collected accordingly by federal and republic (RT) organs. In  the RT-RF Treaty, the question of taxes is excluded from the  matters of joint jurisdiction, unlike in the Federative Treaty  and the RF Constitution.    An important question, which I would say is very often  raised  sharply in considering the sovereign rights of the Tatarstan  Republic, relates to its international and foreign economic  relations. And of course, it should have been reflected in the  RT-RF Treaty. And the authority to coordinate international and  foreign economic relations is actually included among the powers  which are exercised jointly by RT and RF organs of state  authority. It seems to me that this refers here to activity  which is conducted with equal rights on a mutually acceptable  basis. The Federative Treaty states that coordination of the  republics' international and foreign economic relations is  conducted by RF federal organs, though jointly with the  republics.    Let us return to the system of state organs, which is  probably the matter of most importance. I note with satisfaction  that it was resolved in the RT-RF Treaty in complete conformity  with the status of our republic, which has been consolidated in  its constitution. Paragraph 7, Article II of the treaty states  that the Tatarstan Republic's organs of state authority  "establish the system of state organs of the Tatarstan Republic  and the procedure for their organization and activity." Whereas  the RF Constitution, for example, states that "a system of  organs of state authority of the republics, krays...is  established by subjects of the Russian Federation in conformity  with the constitutional system of the Russian Federation and the  general principles for organizing representative and executive  organs of state authority established by federal law."    The courts are important links in the system of state  organs.  The question of these organs, or more precisely, of their  transfer to the exclusive jurisdiction of the RT, has been  raised repeatedly in sessions of the RT Supreme Soviet. It  should be said that this is a very delicate problem. The point  is that as soon as we put the provision for and protection of  citizens' rights in first place in the state's activity  (Paragraph 1, Part 2, Art. II, Paragraph 1, Art. III of the  RT-RF Treaty), we cannot deprive a person and citizen of the  opportunity to defend himself and to turn to any court for this  purpose. Incidentally, in RT courts, for example, there has not  been one case when a citizen convicted by an RT court was denied  referral of a complaint to the Supreme Court of the RF, giving  the reason that this is the court "of another state."    There is another side to the question. Paragraph 2, Art. 19  of our republic's Constitution states: "Citizens of the  Tatarstan Republic hold citizenship in the Russian  Federation--Russia." For this reason, depriving anyone of the  opportunity to seek additional protection, in the RF Supreme  Court, let us say, is a violation of his constitutional right, a  violation of the RT Constitution. The RT-RF Treaty states that  the judicial system is under the jurisdiction of the Russian  Federation and its organs for this reason (Paragraph 13, Art.  III). So the RT Constitution has not been violated in resolving  this matter. Moreover, in conformity with it and Paragraph 5,  Part 2, Art. II of the treaty, organs of state authority of the  Tatarstan Republic have been given the right to pardon persons  convicted by RT courts.    The question of citizenship is also a delicate matter. The  Federative Treaty has a provision only on Russian Federation  citizenship, but the RF Constitution refers to regulation of  citizenship in the Russian Federation by federal organs, which  indirectly assumes citizenship in the republics.    In the RT-RF Treaty, first of all, citizenship in the  Tatarstan Republic is recognized unequivocally; this is  reflected in the authority of its organs of state authority to  resolve republic citizenship matters.    Secondly, common and conflicting questions of citizenship  are  cited among the matters of joint RT-RF jurisdiction (Paragraph  8, Part 2, Art. II, Paragraph 4, Art. II).    In the aspect considered in this article, the form of the  document which consolidates the agreement reached between  empowered RT and RF representatives on demarcation of the  subjects of jurisdiction and reciprocal delegation of powers is  important as well.    This document was drawn up as a treaty, which is used as the  main form of juridical presentation in interstate relations. It  was put together in two languages--Tatar and Russian, and the  texts in both languages have equal force. In the RT-RF Treaty,  unlike the Federative Treaty and the RF Constitution, the  sections on the subjects of jurisdiction are arranged  differently. While the Federative Treaty and the RF Constitution  put the sections dealing with the subjects of RF jurisdiction in  first place, the subjects of joint jurisdiction in second place,  and the republics' jurisdiction in last place, the RT-RF Treaty  puts the powers of the Tatarstan Republic on subjects under its  jurisdiction in first place. It should also be pointed out that  this treaty has no fixed term.    Both time and active work by the appropriate RT and RF  organs  will be needed to fully implement it. For this purpose, the  treaty itself provides for the possibility that additional  agreements may be concluded, and joint structures and  commissions may be established on an equal footing, that is,  with participation by representatives of the sides with equal  rights, as well as the conclusion of agreements on specific  questions related to RT jurisdiction (Paragraphs 6, 12, 13, and  14, Part 2, Art. II) and joint RT-RF jurisdiction (Paragraphs 3,  9, and 11, Art. III).    Other aspects of the treaty could have been examined,  although I believe the arguments cited above make it possible to  say: the RT-RF Treaty is the result of voluntary agreement  between partners with equal rights. It is in complete conformity  with the Constitution of the Tatarstan Republic.</p>

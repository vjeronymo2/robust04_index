			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Today our correspondents interviewed Ukrainian  Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko, who was in our delegation  during the official visit to the United States by President  Leonid Kravchuk.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Anatoliy  Maksymovych, what can you say about the foreign policy results  of the visit to the United States by Leonid Makarovych Kravchuk?    [Zlenko] Summing up this visit, I would like to say first of  all that in general a positive atmosphere preceded this visit.  This positive atmosphere was created by the signing of the  trilateral statement on 14 January between the United States,  Ukraine, and Russia. Naturally, to a certain extent this too  affected both the course of the visit itself and the results of  this visit.    However, if one is to speak about the main foreign policy  results of this visit, then it seems to me that, first of all  this visit made it possible to convince ourselves that a  noticeable change has occurred in Ukrainian-U.S. relations, a  change in relations on the part of the United States toward  Ukraine being a friendly state, one capable of playing a  stabilizing role in the region -- I would even say that  according to some publications of the U.S. press, a state that  could play a significant role at the crossroads of Europe and  Asia.    I would like to say that one may view as another main result  of this visit the fact that the United States unambiguously  stated its support for Ukraine's political and economic  independence. The violation of this, say, important principle  of support, as was said, could affect the strategic balance of  the dislocation of forces in Europe. This visit and its  outcome, its important or significant political results, were  reached not at the expense of and not to the detriment of any  state. [end recording]</p>

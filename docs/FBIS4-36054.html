			<p>BFN     [Text] Abha, 5 Jun -- The GCC [Gulf Cooperation Council]  countries' foreign ministers have stressed today that "the  continuation of the fighting in Yemen would lead the countries  of the GCC Council to take appropriate stances toward the side  that does not abide by the cease-fire, after consultations with  Arab and international parties about the measures necessary to  be taken by the Security Council vis-a-vis this escalating  situation in accordance with the principles of the UN Charter."    The ministers also stressed, in the final communique they  released after the end of their current session, that "it is  absolutely impossible to impose this unity by military means."    They noted that the union, which was set up by agreement  between the two independent states -- the Yemen Arab Republic  and the Democratic People's Republic of Yemen in May 1990 --  "cannot continue except by the consent of the two parties."    The final press release said that "faced with the fait  accompli of the fact that one of the parties announced its  decision to revert back to the former status of two republics  and the setting up of a the Democratic Republic of Yemen, the  two parties can only deal with this situation through peaceful  means."    The press release added that "in consideration of the  motives  of the sincere sons of Yemen regarding unity, the two sides can  deal with situation only within a framework of peaceful methods."    Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal, chairman of the current GCC  ministerial session, refused to comment on whether the final  press release meant putting political pressure on the side that  did not accept a cease- fire. He said: "I have no more details  to give other than the ones mentioned in the final press  release."    The GCC's ministerial council urged Yemen's leaders to put  the Yemen's interests and its people above all considerations  and to respond immediately to UN Security Council Resolution 924  to stop military operations immediately and to resort to  dialogue in order to stop bloodshed and protect lives and  possessions.    The council expressed "sorrow for the continuation of the  fighting despite the issuing of the UN resolution."    The council statement said that "the continuation between  the  two parties made leaders in southern Yemen declare the  establishment of the Democratic Republic of Yemen." [sentence as  received]    The statement clarified that "although the council  appreciates the sincere motives of Yemen's sons for unity, it  confirms that it cannot impose this unity through military  means."</p>

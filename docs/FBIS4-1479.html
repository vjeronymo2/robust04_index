			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  THE STAR </H8>   `Power' in Process of Democracy -- "Closely scrutinised,  this  incredible week has delivered enough faults and failings to fill  an encyclopeadia. But there are times that close scrutiny is  misleading, and this is one of them," begins the Johannesburg  THE STAR in English on 29 April in a page-10 editorial. "The  big picture is majestic," contends the editorial. "South  Africans rose to the occasion in dignity and, on the whole, in  remarkable peace." New problems and situations await the new  South Africa, concludes THE STAR, but "if we have not yet found  the answers to all the issues of the future, we have found the  way to face them. This week we have seen and experienced -- and  felt -- the power of the process of democracy."  <H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>   Electoral Irregularities Viewed -- "It is unfortunate,  though  not altogether surprising, that the main feature of the  election, apart from the actual voting, is the huge number of  alleged irregularities, many of which are serious," begins the  Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 29 April in a page-8  editorial. The task of declaring the election free and fair now  awaits the Independent Electoral Commission, IEC, and "those who  carp at the supposed anomaly of the IEC judging its own  performance should best be quiet. Anyone who thought this a bad  idea should have said so months ago when the politicians set out  the IEC's terms of reference." In order to declare the  elections free and fair the IEC has "to satisfy itself that the  numerous irregularities have been sufficiently evenly spread, so  that no party has been substantially disadvantaged. The last  thing we need is a major party rejecting the outcome because of  legitimate grievances." A heavy responsibility awaits Judge  Kriegler in making his decision on the elections, and "no one  will envy him this responsibility."  <H8>  SOWETAN </H8>   Absence of Voting Intimidation -- Johannesburg SOWETAN in  English on 29 April in a page-8 editorial is "proud of the total  absence of intimidation" during the voting period across the  country. "What seems evident is South Africans have become  mature after the terrible changes in our lives lately. All that  remains is that our people will accept the results with  similarly responsible discipline."    People To Demand `Immediate Satisfaction' From New  Government  -- A second editorial on the same page warns that "people will  demand immediate satisfaction from a new government after the  elections. It will be impossible to satisfy all expectations as  apartheid has left large sectors of our country in an  overwhelming mess." "A new Government must be seen to act with  vigour. The planning and clearing of areas for housing must be  in evidence. The plans to proceed with putting up houses for  millions of homeless people can then be developed in stages."  <H8>  WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN </H8>   Buthelezi, IEC `Incompetence' -- "The pattern is the same  all  over: the force of numbers and the strength of individuals  overcoming the problems of the elections," notes Johannesburg  WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN in English for 29 Apr-5 May. There was  "calm" and "little violence" and "the inevitable conclusion is  that the election can still work -- despite the IEC. There is  no point in mincing words about that organisation. Despite  hundreds of millions of rands, lavish salaries and massive  popular support, they have messed it up through sheer  incompetence. It has been a gravy train without wheels." The  IEC "failed at its most basic logistical task: getting ballot  papers to the polling stations." "When it became apparent that  things were going wrong, Mr Justice J. Kriegler chose to fluff  the details, covering the extent of the problem. He was cocky  and super-confident, in defiance of the facts being put before  him. He was dismissive of the media -- the link between himself  and the public he so badly needs on his side -- and made little  attempt to rally support behind him. It was a mistake."  "Luckily, everyone has been leaning over backwards to make sure  the election works -- with the sole exception of Chief  Mangosuthu Buthelezi." "He disrupts the election preparation as  much as possible, then he complains that it does not run  smoothly. He should not be allowed to get away with it. Sadly,  IEC incompetence has given him more ground than he should have."  <H8>  NEW NATION </H8>   Buthelezi `Exploits' IEC `Incompetence' -- Johannesburg NEW  NATION in English on 29 April in its page-16 editorial cautions  that "all is not won yet and the struggle to secure the election  faces serious threats." The threats came mainly from Inkatha  and the Pan- Africanist Congress (PAC), "each warning of the  lack of freeness and fairness in the elections." The paper  questions Buthelezi's "supposed commitment to transition through  elections. He has punctuated virtually everyone of his comments  by warning that the freeness and fairness of the election was  being threatened -- by the incompetence of the Independent  Electoral Commission (IEC), intimidation from the ANC and  bombings by his old rightwing partners in the tattered Freedom  Alliance." "It was Buthelezi's intractable attitude to  negotiations and disdain for the reasonable principle of  majority rule that must take a large part of the blame for the  problems faced by the poll." KwaZulu was one of the areas most  affected by the IEC's "shortcomings" but "this was not because  of the IEC's incompetence but because of Inkatha's bellicose and  sometimes violent resistance to the commission preparing these  areas for the elections." Therefore, Buthelezi "must not be  allowed to exploit the incompetence of the IEC, or the problems  experienced in the management of these elections to delay the  outcome of the poll. While it is his right to challenge the  freeness and fairness of the elections, he must not be allowed  to prevent the IEC from announcing a result soon."</p>

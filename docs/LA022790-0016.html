			<p><P> February 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHANGES  </P> <P> A lot of changes have occurred throughout the world in 1989.  </P> <P> What about America? What about Los Angeles? There may be no need for a change  in government but the problems in America are taking a back seat to those in  the rest of the world. Change should be taking place right here. Build centers  for the homeless. Increase the size of the Police Department. Put more money  into the school system. Build a subway system.  </P> <P> The country and this area have grown stagnant. Progress in all areas is  necessary for the survival of this country. Is there anyone listening? Do not  look at the television; look out the window instead.  </P> <P> BRIAN RIEMER  </P> <P> Malibu  </P></p>

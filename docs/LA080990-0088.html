			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> ALL-STAR TEAMS MAKE PITCH FOR CHAMPIONSHIPS  </P> <P> As the summer baseball and softball seasons wind down, several Glendale-area  all-star teams are contending for titles.  </P> <P> The La Crescenta Babe Ruth all-stars, made up of 13-year-olds, were scheduled  to play Wednesday night in the Babe Ruth Western Regionals at Carson City.  Results were not available at press time.  </P> <P> La Crescenta advanced to the third round by defeating Reno, Nev., 7-4, and  Arizona, 9-6.  </P> <P> The winner of the regional advances to the Babe Ruth World Series at Jamestown,  N.Y.  </P> <P> Entering this week, the Crescenta Valley Little League all-stars were still  alive in the Division 2 tournament at Long Beach. The winner advances to the  Western Regionals.  </P> <P> Crescenta Valley defeated West Arcadia, Laguna and Woodland Hills en route to  Tuesday night's winners'-bracket showdown with Cypress. Results of that game  were not available at press time.  </P> <P> In softball, Nancy Evans had 18 strikeouts as the Centennial League all-stars  defeated Tucson (Ariz.), 3-0, Monday in the opening round of the 13-15-year-old  Senior Division Western Regional at Pinole, Calif.  </P> <P> Centennial, which finished second in the 1989 Senior World Series, will play  Red Bluff, Calif., today in a second-round game.  </P> <P> In the 10-12-year-old Major Division, Lindsay Parker struck out 13 and pitched  her seventh consecutive no-hitter as the Liberty League all-stars defeated  Albuquerque, 6-1, and advanced to the second-round.  </P> <P> Life in the fast lane: Tom Kendall of La Canada won his third consecutive  Trans-Am Series auto race July 29 at Atlanta.  </P> <P> Kendall, 23, collected $11,050 for the victory, averaging 105 m.p.h. over the  40-lap course. The victory gives Kendall a 29-point lead over Darin Brassfield  in the Trans-Am standings.  </P> <P> Trading places: Distance runner Robert Nelson, who attended Pasadena City  College last year, will transfer to Glendale College and James Moore, the  Western State Conference 10,000-meter champion for Glendale (31 minutes 36.2  seconds) this spring, will transfer to Pasadena.  </P> <P> Neither runner will be eligible during cross-country season. However, both  could compete in track if the residency requirement of 12 units is completed  during the fall.  </P> <P> Nelson placed 10th in the Southern California junior college regional  cross-country championships last season. Moore placed 17th at the Southern  California regional cross-country championships and 21st at the state meet.  </P> <P> Kirby Lee contributed to this notebook.  </P></p>

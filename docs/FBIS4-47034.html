The volume of industrial production  declined in January-March 1994 by 21 percent. Production is  declining because of instability in mutual clearing between  enterprises, shrinking demand for output, and lack of sufficient  funds to purchase raw material and components.    There are production stoppages at 50-70 percent of kray  enterprises monthly; losses amount to 15 percent of the standard  work schedule; 75 percent of losses stem from difficulties in  selling output, and 23 percent are caused by lack of raw  material and components.    In the fuel and energy sector, the volume of production  declined by 18 percent, including electric power generation--by  4 percent, coal production--by 29 percent, primary oil  refining--by 25 percent, and, correspondingly, the output of  automotive gasoline--by 37 percent, diesel fuel--by 30 percent,  and boiler oil--by 19 percent.    Metallurgical enterprises cut steel-smelting by 16 percent  and production of rolled metal by 48 percent. Gold production  increased by 41 percent.    In machine building, the volume of production fell off by 46  percent, including production of gas turbines--by 76 percent,  metal-cutting machine tools--by 62 percent, traveling cranes--by  78 percent, and accumulator batteries--by 20 percent.    In the timber, woodworking, and pulp and paper industry, the  outtake of commercial wood dropped by 37 percent, production of  lumber--by 42 percent, plywood--by 77 percent, wood-chip  board--by 55 percent, wood-fiber board--by 19 percent,  cardboard--by 50 percent, and cellulose--by 73 percent.    In the construction materials industry, production declined  by 38 percent, including that of brick--by 18 percent,  preassembled ferroconcrete components--by 39 percent, and rolled  roofing materials--by 48 percent.    The output of consumer goods fell by almost 30 percent,  including foodstuffs--by 25 percent, and nonfood items--by 38  percent. The output of basic foodstuffs is characterized by the  following data:                                Actually produced      January-March 1994 as %                                                     of January-March 1993   Meat, including category    3,196                  83  I subproducts, tonnes   Sausages, tonnes            2,797                  82   Ready-to-cook meat          488                    86  products, tonnes   Whole-milk products,        14,419                 87  tonnes   Canned fish, thousand       2,288                  2.9 times  standard cans   Flour, tonnes               39,801                 95   Cereal, tonnes              4,863                  92   Bread and bakery items,     28,043                 82  tonnes   Confectionery items,        5,180                  67  tonnes   Macaroni items, tonnes      1,777                  66   Margarine, tonnes           1,972                  62      Production of alcoholic beverages declined by 22 percent.    A difficult situation arose with respect to production of  light industry goods. In January-March their output declined by  52 percent.    The average wage in industry over March amounted to  R261,000 and increased as compared to January by 20.5  percent.    CAPITAL CONSTRUCTION. In the first quarter of 1994  enterprises of all forms of ownership in the kray utilized  R110.2 billion of capital investment. Capital assets worth R19.1  billion were commissioned.    The main source of financing capital construction is  enterprises' own funds (more than 48 percent of all capital  investment). Centralized funds financed out of the republic  budget comprised 26 percent, local budgets--18 percent,  preferential credits--7 percent, and investment funds--0.3  percent.    State enterprises and organizations accounted for the  greatest share of utilized capital investment (62 percent),  followed by joint-stock companies (36 percent as compared to 6.1  percent in the first quarter of 1993).    Within the scope of capital investment, R57.3 billion, or 52  percent, was used for construction of production facilities.    In the agro-industrial complex [APK], R4.5 billion of  capital  investment was utilized, which is four times less than in the  first quarter of 1993. Of the total volume of investment in the  APK, state budget funds comprised one-third.    Housing construction accounted for R35.3 billion.  Enterprises  and organizations of all forms of ownership, utilizing all  sources of financing, built housing with a total area of 78,700  square meters, which is 22 percent more than over the  corresponding period of last year. A total of 1,292 apartments  were built; at the same time, 125,600 families are on waiting  lists for housing.    AGRICULTURE. The total volume of agricultural  production in the first quarter of this year fell off by 11  percent as compared to the first quarter of 1993.    Kolkhozes, sovkhozes, and agricultural enterprises (on the  basis of sovkhozes) produced 6,800 tonnes of meat (livestock and  poultry sold for slaughter) in live weight, which is 8 percent  below last year's level; 12,200 tonnes of milk (6 percent less);  and 66.3 million eggs (19 percent less).    Production of meat declined at the farms of six rayons, most  significantly among them the farms in Komsomolskiy Rayon--by 41  percent; that of milk--in all rayons with the exception of  Bikinskiy and Imeni Sergeya Lazo; and of eggs--in all except  Sovetsko-Gavanskiy Rayon.    Over three months of the current year, milk yield per cow  amounted to 483 kg, which is 24 kg more than over the  corresponding period of last year.    The yield per laying hen amounted to 50 eggs, which is six  eggs less than last year.    The herd of productive livestock in kolkhozes, sovkhozes,  and  agricultural enterprises (on the basis of sovkhozes) continues  to decline. As of 1 April of 1994 it consisted of 63,200 head of  horned cattle (90 percent of the first quarter of 1993),  including 25,000 cows (89 percent); 164,100 swine (96 percent);  and 3.736 million head of poultry (85 percent).    Production of calves declined by 9 percent, that of piglets  increased by 14 percent.    Horned cattle mortality increased by 3 percent, and swine  mortality--by 17 percent.    The drop in the output of animal husbandry products resulted  in a smaller volume of procurement of milk and eggs--by 5  percent and 23 percent, respectively--and amounted to 10,200  tonnes and 48.2 million units. There was 0.5 percent more  livestock and poultry procured than in the first quarter of  1993--a total of 6,200 tonnes (in live weight). Farms in six  rayons reduced the quantities of livestock and poultry sold to  the state, most significantly among them the farms in Amurskiy  Rayon--by 67 percent; of milk--the farms in 11 rayons, among  them Ulchskiy--by 89 percent, and Tuguro-Chumyakanskiy--by 65  percent; and of eggs--the farms in all rayons except  Sovetsko-Gavanskiy.    As of 1 April there were 1,850 peasant (private) farms in  the  kray; they were allocated 45,500 hectares (25 hectares on  average per farm). The greatest number of peasant (private)  farms were registered in Imeni Lazo Rayon--467, and Khabarovsk  Rayon--367. Along with new peasant farms being formed, 244 farms  went out of business since 1992.    In the first quarter of 1994 1,524 families received land  for  collective orchards and vegetable gardens.    TRANSPORTATION AND COMMUNICATIONS. The volume of  cargo shipping by all categories of transport decreased as  compared to the first quarter of 1993 by 30 percent and amounted  to 5.0113 million tonnes. In rail transportation, cargo  shipments declined by 26.8 percent, in automotive--by 44.6  percent, and air transportation--by 25 percent; at the same  time, 31 percent more cargo was moved by river transport  enterprises.    In pipeline transport, 49,300 tonnes of petroleum products  (20 percent less) entered the pipeline at the point of  origination.    In rail transport the volume of loading of almost all most  important categories of cargo declined, including bituminous  coal--by 38.3 percent, oil and petroleum products--by 26.5  percent, timber--by 26.2 percent, and grain and products of  milling--by 24.9 percent. Loading of chemical and mineral  fertilizer declined dramatically--by 97 percent. Loading of  cement increased by 3.5 times.    In the first quarter of this year, 226,000 tonnes of  cargo--63 percent less than in the first quarter of last  year--were delivered to the Vanino railroad transfer station,  which is a gateway shipping point for cargo destined for the  regions of the Far North and areas equated to it.    In air transportation in the first quarter, as compared to  the first quarter of last year, despite rate deregulation the  passenger flow increased by 9 percent, and in automotive  transportation--by 3 percent. Automotive carriers moved 68.038  million passengers, and air carriers--576,000 (105 percent and  128.1 percent, respectively, as compared to the first quarter of  last year).    Because of the insufficient pool of the rolling stock and  its  poor technical condition, the situation with respect to city and  suburban transportation services for the population remains  difficult.    Each month more than 16 percent of scheduled bus, trolley  bus, and streetcar runs in Khabarovsk are not performed.    Expenditures for repairs of roads and structures amounted to  R2.879 billion.    Over the first quarter of 1994, communications services  enterprises earned R27.4608 billion from their main activities.  Communication services provided for the population accounted for  R5.9335 billion of earnings.    The physical volume of most important categories of  communication services declined considerably: newspaper and  magazine subscription and retail sales--by 28.3 percent;  letters, postcards, and small parcels--by 33.2 percent; and  money transfers--by 28.5 percent. On the other hand, 1.7 times  more declared-value parcels were sent than in the first quarter  of 1993.    THE CONSUMER MARKET. In the current year the trade  sector continued to adapt to new conditions. Retail turnover,  including public catering, for January-March amounted to R269.5  billion, which in current prices is 6.4 times more than the  corresponding period of last year, and in comparable prices--20  percent less. State-owned trade enterprises accounted for 52  percent of the turnover (65 percent in January-March 1993),  privately owned--34 percent (7 percent), and consumer  cooperatives and enterprises of other types of ownership--14  percent (28 percent). The turnover structure has changed as  compared to the first quarter of 1993. The proportion of  foodstuffs increased from 61 to 64 percent, and the proportion  of nonfood items dropped from 39 to 36 percent.    Public catering turnover amounted to R20 billion and  declined  in comparable prices by 20 percent. This was caused by the  decline in the number of public catering enterprises.    Continuous market saturation with goods is characterized by  the current inventories in trade; there were R163 billion worth  of inventories, which is enough for 59 days of trading. A year  ago this indicator was equal to 45 days.    The volume of for-fee services provided to the population  amounted to R52 billion, which is 8.9 times more in current  prices than last year, but 56 percent less in comparable prices.  The volume of services provided for the population by privately  owned enterprises accounted for 3 percent of the total volume of  services.    Consumer services account for 12 percent of the total volume  for for-fee services. Their actual volume was R6.1 billion. In  current prices this is 7.3 times more than over the  corresponding period of last year. However, the real volume of  consumer services declined by 50 percent.    FOREIGN ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES. In the first quarter,  the kray's foreign trade turnover amounted to $131.3 million.  Kray enterprises exported $97.1 million worth of products as  compared to $39.7 million over the corresponding period of 1993.    The geography of shipments abroad changed somewhat. While in  the first quarter 1993 the greatest share of exports went to  China (33 percent), during the period under review these exports  accounted for only 5.6 percent. Japan remains constant as a  traditional consumer of timber; exports to this country in the  first quarter comprised 67 percent as compared to 27.5 percent  in the first quarter of 1993. Exports to the Republic of Korea  dropped somewhat from 8.6 percent to 6 percent. Exports to the  United States grew from $40,000 to $2.2 million; to  Australia--from $2.1 million to $7.9 million. Contacts with  Israel, Turkey, and other countries are expanding.    The structure of exports remains practically unchanged with  minor fluctuations. The proportion of timber comprised 56.7  percent, ferrous metals--14.4 percent, oil products--12.8  percent, and nonferrous metals--3.6 percent. It should be noted  that the proportional share of deliveries of various  transportation equipment purchased outside the kray borders has  dropped (from 4.1 percent to 0.6 percent).    Imports were brought from 23 countries and their value in  the  first quarter amounted to $34.2 million. Goods from China  account for the greatest proportion of imports--69.5 percent,  from the Republic of Korea--10.9 percent, and from the United  States--6.3 percent.    The bulk of imports are light industry goods (48.3 percent)  and foodstuffs (46.7 percent). The rest of imports are  represented by a variety of goods.    PRIVATIZATION. Since the beginning of the year  107 enterprises (facilities) have been privatized, and overall  since the beginning of privatization--1,046 enterprises. In the  current year, 33 percent of privatized enterprises were in  industry, 29 percent--in the trade sector, and 18 percent--in  consumer services.    Enterprises privatized through conversion to joint-stock  holding comprised 38 percent of the total (41 enterprises). Of  the three versions of privatization, labor collectives preferred  the second option, which allows them to keep the controlling  share.    "Small-business" privatization is carried out mainly by way  of selling enterprises through commercial bids (74 percent) and  auctions (12 percent) and by buying out leased property (14  percent).    The greatest number of facilities sold were in  Khabarovsk--48, and Komsomolsk--23; among the rayons:  Vaninskiy--10, Amurskiy--six, and Nikolayevskiy and  Solnechnyy--five each.    Privatization of enterprises generated in the first quarter  (including money received for enterprises privatized earlier)  R4.893 billion in monetary revenue and brought in 115,900  privatization vouchers.    Of the total revenue, R389.7 million [as published], or 80  percent, was transferred into the budgets of all levels.    In January-March 1994, 9,439 apartments in the kray with a  total area of 480,700 square meters were transferred to the  private ownership of citizens. Apartments were privatized in  almost all rayons, except Nanayskiy and Imeni P. Osipenko.    The Khabarovsk universal exchange Bizon, which operates on  kray territory, in the first quarter conducted 24 tradings at  which 197 deals were concluded. The exchange's turnover  comprised R738.8 million.    PRICES. As compared to December 1993, consumer  prices for consumer goods and for-fee services in March  increased by 32.8 percent, including by 28.5 percent for  consumer goods and by 92.5 percent for for-fee services.    Over the quarter the rate of price increases for consumer  goods and for-fee services declined, and in March amounted to  6.3 percent (12.8 percent in January, and 10.8 percent in  February).    Prices for producer goods rose by 26.1 percent. Of  foodstuffs, the greatest price increases were registered with  respect to bread and bakery items, flour, and eggs--1.5-fold;  macaroni items, cereals, legumes, and canned  vegetables--1.7-2.2-fold; milk and milk products, sausages, fish  products, confectionery items, vegetables, and potatoes--by  30-40 percent. At the same time, prices for butter, vegetable  oil, margarine, meat and poultry, tea, and salt rose by 6-20  percent. Prices for citrus fruit dropped on average by 15  percent.    Prices for nonfood items rose as compared to December 1993  by  31.4 percent. Prices for goods for children continued to rise:  those for footwear, clothing, and underwear went up  1.5-1.7-fold, including a threefold increase in prices for  preschool children's footwear.    Prices for fabrics, footwear, furniture, clothing, and  underwear, electric goods, hosiery and knitwear, fur and items  made of it, rugs and carpeting went up by 20-50 percent; those  for headgear (except made of fur), metal utensils, and  jewelry--1.6-twofold; and office supplies--3.3-fold.    Of construction materials, prices increased the most with  respect to wood-fiber board, cement, and roof slate--2.3-fold.    Gasoline prices went up 1.7-fold, with the price per liter  reaching R267.    Prices for the same goods differed perceptibly in March  between kray's cities and rayons. The gap between maximum and  minimum prices measured a factor of 1.6 with respect to butter,  2.7 with respect to milk, 1.4--eggs, 1.5--sugar, and 1.6 with  respect to bread.    Prices and fees for for-fee services for the population  increased in March by 92.5 percent as compared to December 1993,  which is 50 percentage points higher than the rate of increases  in consumer goods prices.    The cost of communications services went up the most  (2.6-fold), and among them subscriber fee for residential  telephone services and telegraph services--3.3-fold.    The cost of passenger transportation more than doubled,  while  suburban train fares increased 3.2-fold.    While the cost of municipal services increased 1.9-fold,  rent  in municipal housing increased eightfold.    The cost of stay in sanitariums, resorts, fitness  facilities,  and health care institutions, cultural facilities, parents'  share of the cost of keeping children in preschool facilities,  and consumer services increased 1.6-1.9-fold.    Following the increase in fuel and energy prices, expenses  for freight transportation increased (1.8-fold). Freight rates  went up especially perceptibly in air (2.4-fold) and rail  (1.8-fold) transportation.    Prices for producer goods in March as compared to December  1993 increased by 40 percent.    In electric power generation, as well as the timber and  woodworking industry, prices increased 1.8-fold; in the  petroleum refining industry, and lifting and transportation  machine-building--by 40 percent. The cost of production of  wood-chip board increased 2.4-fold.    Wholesale prices for consumer goods rose at a somewhat  lesser  rate than those for producer goods.    Prices in bread-baking and meat-packing industry increased  by  20 percent. The greatest price increases were noted in the dairy  industry--by 40 percent, including for milk and fermented milk  products--1.6-fold.    The rate of price increases declined in light industry (97.9  percent) and liquor distilling (97.8 percent) industries.    FINANCES. Overall, the kray's economy over two  months of the current year produced about R50 billion in  profits; as compared to the corresponding period of last year,  profits increased 2.1-fold. The slow growth in profits stems  mainly from the problems in product distribution and the  shortage of financial resources at a score of enterprises.    Almost 31 percent of enterprises in all sectors of the  economy operated at a loss.    The greatest proportion of unprofitable enterprises was in  the municipal services sector (46.7 percent), transportation  (41.9 percent), material and technical supply (35.7 percent),  and trade (35.4 percent). Vyazemskiy Rayon enterprises operated  at a loss--the proportion of unprofitable enterprises here  comprised 56.3 percent--as well as those in Verkhnebureinskiy  (52.9 percent), Nikolayevskiy (47.6 percent), Komsomolskiy (40.0  percent), and Okhotskiy (46.2 percent) Rayons.    The insolvency problem in the economy remains acute.    According to data received from enterprises and  organizations  in industry, agriculture, transportation, and construction on  the territory of Khabarovsk Kray, their total liabilities to  supplier enterprises in February 1994 amounted to R759.3  billion--an 8.7-percent increase as compared to January of this  year. Past due liability to suppliers amounted to R426.3 billion  (58.1 percent of the total liability).    Industrial enterprises account for 71.8 percent of all  liabilities, construction--13.3 percent, transportation--13.2  percent, and agriculture--1.7 percent. A considerable share of  past due liabilities results from not receiving timely payments  for products shipped to consumer enterprises.    Customer liability for the goods shipped amounted to R659.0  billion, including R379.7 billion (57.6 percent) past due.    Industrial enterprises account for the greatest share of  customer liability (70.4 percent).    The financial situation of enterprises and organizations is  exacerbated by the poor state of mutual clearing in the economy.  Total accounts payable amounted to R806.4 billion and increased  as compared to January of this year by 6.1 percent, including  past due accounts payable--R381.9 billion (47.3 of the total  due).    Industrial enterprises account for the greatest share of  accounts payable owed (75.8 percent). Debts to suppliers amount  to R586.4 billion, of which 49.1 percent are past due.    Loan debt amounted to R10 billion, and the debt of bank  credit--R189 billion.    The volume of enterprises' back pay and other pay-related  liability is growing.    As of 1 April obligations with respect to the issuance of  consumption funds at industrial, construction, and agricultural  enterprises amounted to R42.7 billion.    Enterprises in Khabarovsk, Komsomolsk-na-Amure, and  Sovetsko-Gavanskiy and Amurskiy Rayons account for a  considerable share of money not paid out on schedule. Back pay  owed to workers in industry amounts to R25.7 billion, in  construction--13.6 billion, and in agriculture--R3.5 billion.    The greatest amounts are owed to their employees by the AO  [joint-stock company] Sea Resources in Sovetskaya Gavan--about  R2.7 billion; AO Shipbuilding Plant in Komsomolsk--R2.0 billion;  industrial-construction association Khabgrazhdanstroy--R395  million; and AO Heating Equipment Plant--R385 billion. The main  cause of past due liabilities are the high rate of inflation and  low payment discipline in the economy, which makes it more  difficult for enterprises to form the necessary financial  resources for production expansion and social development.    THE POPULATION'S INCOME. The monetary income of  the population over the first quarter of 1994 amounted to R764  billion and increased 10-fold as compared to the first quarter  of 1993. Of the total amount of monetary income, the population  spent about R370 billion on purchases of goods and services,  which is eight times more than in the first quarter of last  year; taxes, various contributions, and other types of expenses  amounted to R87 billion; and R200 billion were deposited in bank  accounts and used to purchase securities.    The main source of monetary income for the majority of the  population is wages. The average monthly wage in kray economic  sectors in the first quarter amounted to R239,000 and increased  as compared to December 1993 by 2 percent.    The average wage in industry in March amounted to R261,000,  in construction--R275,000, in sovkhozes--R162,000, in  transportation--R374,000, in communications--R403,000, in health  care and social security--R211,000, education--R177,000, culture  and arts--R173,000, and in science and science-related  services--R184,000.    EMPLOYMENT. In the first quarter, 568,000 persons  were employed in the kray's economy. The nonstate sector, where  currently more than 20 percent of the labor force are employed,  is beginning to play an increasingly greater role.    The number of workers in the main sector of the social  complex--education, health care, housing and municipal  services--has increased. There is a stable growth in employment  in the credit industry and state insurance, tax inspectorates,  notary offices, and legal services, evidence that an  infrastructure typical of a market economy is beginning to form.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Gheorghe Tinca by Marian </F> Ivancu; place and date not given: "We Rely on the Essence of  Our Military Doctrine"]    [Text] [Ivancu] Mr. Gheorghe Tinca, you are the first  civilian in the post-war era to be appointed head of the  Ministry of National Defense. What are the political  implications of the appointment of a career diplomat to the  position of defense minister?    [Tinca] It is obvious that the Army cannot be torn away from  the Romanian social context. Its integration in the  institutional system is totally different from what we  understood as the relations between the Army and the political  body in the past, when the Army was under the control of a  totalitarian party. The Army institution will undoubtedly have  links with the political structures, but they will be adjusted  to the current pluralistic and democratic political system.    The main issue is to protect the Army against partisan  political influences. It cannot afford to tailor itself to the  political interests of any given party, thus deflecting its  attention from the main mission, which is the defense of the  country.    The civilian minister must ensure interaction between the  Ministry of National Defense and the other state institutions or  political forces in society. I was well received at the  Ministry of National Defense and I feel encouraged by the people  surrounding me. Their kindness and hope obliges me to do my  best. The Ministry of National Defense is engaged in many  contacts with the ministries of other countries. I could say  that we are conducting a very intensive military diplomacy at  this time. Therefore, the presence of a diplomat at the  Ministry of National Defense has been considered as opportune.    [Ivancu] What direction is the Romanian Army taking?    [Tinca] A new geostrategic context has emerged, which  requires a restructuring of the Army's missions, a readjustment  of its equipment and training, and a process of reevaluation on  the organizational plane. The Army must be the supreme defense  instrument of our authentic national values, as stipulated by  the Constitution.    [Ivancu] How do you estimate the defense budget? Are there  ways and means for self-financing?    [Tinca] The Army's budget is relatively small. It is in  accordance with the possibilities of our economy. I believe  that the Army could find self-financing solutions in certain  spheres. However, we must be careful that these measures do not  impinge on the Army's training and equipment.    [Ivancu] What significance do you attach to the national  armaments industry?    [Tinca] I appreciate the fact that the mass media has played  a positive role in sensitizing public opinion on the  difficulties faced by the national arms industry. One should  realize that part of the budget money must go to this industry.  One cannot have a modern army without making some effort and  without ensuring its modernization in the technical, productive,  and creative spheres. By proceeding cleverly and courageously,  it is possible to ensure that production in the military sphere  also have a positive impact on other spheres of our national  industry.    [Ivancu] In what stage is the process of working out  Romania's military doctrine?    [Tinca] Romania's military doctrine is being elaborated  through the conjunction of the country's institutional and  political factors. This document, which is being consolidated  now, will be shortly submitted to the approval of the Country's  Supreme Defense Council (CSAT). On the other hand, there is  also the Integrated Concept on Romania's National Security  (CISNR), a broader program that also includes the military  aspect. This document is also being processed now, with a view  to its adoption by the CSAT. The two documents will be endorsed  by the CSAT and then submitted to parliament.    [Ivancu] What is the situation of Romania's military  alliances?    [Tinca] Regarding the system of alliances, the situation is  tougher here, since we do not have military alliances and no  security guarantees either, in a military sense. However, we  rely on the essence of our military doctrine and the essence of  our defense policy. They are in accordance with the interest of  many countries to have stability in our region and to be able to  count on us in this respect. It is up to us to consolidate  these interests and draw further sympathy and support. All our  history proves that the essence of Romanian military policy has  been defensive. We did not attack anyone. We only entered  World War II because the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact obliged us to  do so, including from the viewpoint of military honor.    [Ivancu] What role is played by the "Partnership for Peace"  agreement? What is Romania's political-military orientation?    [Tinca] "Partnership for Peace" is no political-military  alliance and offers no guarantees in a military sense.  Nevertheless, it contributes to achieving stability, by granting  equal treatment to all participants and by its convergence with  our purely defensive military interests. It is a long process,  which presupposes compatibility and gradual integration. We  hope that we will also stand to benefit a bit from it, in the  military technology and research spheres. We are interested in  having peace around our country and in Europe and we want to  develop relations with our neighbors, based on respect for  international norms. Tensions and particularly conflicts are  not good for us.    Our long-term political-military and economic orientation is  in accordance with our national interests and not with set  patterns or passing fads. The overall modernization of the  country does not mean losing one's identity in action, but  necessarily requires various forms of integration.    [Ivancu] How does the Ministry of National Defense view  international military cooperation?    [Tinca] The Romanian Army is interested in modernizing its  technology in a price-efficiency ratio as favorable as possible  to the targets of our national defense.    We very much want to develop cooperation with the United  States and other developed countries. In this respect, I would  like to remind you that we cooperated with the developed  countries in the sphere of defense industry before 1989, too.    The elimination of obstacles raised by the Coordinating  Committee for Multilateral Export Control (COCOM) creates better  prospects for cooperation in combat technology. We also hope  that the "Partnership for Peace" agreement will entail positive  developments in this respect, too.    [Ivancu] What is Romania's riposte efficacy and capability?    [Tinca] There is no reason to fear that the Army is not  prepared, that it is hesitating or overwhelmed by difficulties,  or that it cannot fulfill its basic duty of defending Romania's  sovereignty and territorial integrity. We, like others, have  problems and, unfortunately, have also had some accidents. But  it would be wrong to draw hasty conclusions about the combat  capacity and determination of the Romanian Army. It is not bad  that these problems are brought to the fore in the media. The  public becomes acquainted with our problems and thus more aware  of the Army's needs.    [Ivancu] What, in your opinion, are the prospects of the  Romanian Army?    [Tinca] I hope that the Army will make substantial progress  in its modernization. For this year, I would like the Army's  operative capability to be maintained and improved within the  limits of the funds allocated to us from the budget. I -- and  not just me -- am convinced that greater emphasis should be  placed on the social protection of military personnel. It would  be unjust to leave the soldiers -- who love their country both  in good and hard times -- outside the current concerns with  easing up the difficulties of the transition. However, I  believe that now, when the Army is in full swing of the reform  process, the civilian society should clearly indicate that it  understands the Army's difficulties, including the social  problems of the Army's military or civilian personnel.</p>

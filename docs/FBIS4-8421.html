			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Lindita Karadaku] </F>   [Text] Tirana, April 12 (ATA) -- Since April 11, the  border crossing point of Tushemisht in the border between  Albania and Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  -- FYROM] has begun a 24-hour service for the crossing of  nationals from both sides and of small vehicles, such as cars  and other means of transportation.    Whereas the Qafe-Thane border point, known for the long line  of vehicles and people waiting to cross the border, will  continue to work for 24 hours like before, but only for trucks.    This change intends to facilitate the crossing of the border  by nationals and vehicles, according to a source close to the  Albanian Ministry of Public Order.    According to a note published today by the newspaper  RILINDJA, the Macedonian Ministry of Interior has confirmed this  change in a communique, as well.</p>

			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Mozambique army doubts Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano said yesterday his country was unlikely to reach its target of creating a 30,000-strong army before its first multi-party elections due in October, Reuter reports from Harare. Mozambique, a former Portuguese colony, is supposed to have an army drawn equally from troops of the ruling Frelimo party and the former rebel movement Renamo under a 1992 peace accord which ended 16 years of civil war. 'The new army comprising both Frelimo Renamo is ready, but we won't reach our target of 30,000 men before the elections,' Mr Chissano told a news conference in Harare. In recent months the United Nations, which is supervising the country's transition to democracy, had expressed doubt that the painfully slow integration of the former foes would be completed in time for the elections. The Mozambican leader, on a brief visit to Zimbabwe, said preparations for the polls were advanced with voter registration nearly completed.</p>

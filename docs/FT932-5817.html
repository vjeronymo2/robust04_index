			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / BBC and Reuters plan TV service BBC WORLD Service Television and Reuters, the international news and information group, are planning to launch a 24-hour-a-day satellite television news service aimed at Latin America, Spain and the Hispanic population of the US. The two groups said yesterday they were negotiating with the Telemundo Group, the Spanish-language television network that operates in the US. The aim is to launch the service later this year. It would be beamed from Miami by satellite to cable networks and broadcast stations throughout the Americas. A deal would mark a further stage in BBC World Service Television's strategy of taking its service round the globe. It is already available throughout Asia, in Africa and in Europe and plans are well advanced to launch in Japan. Reuters has also been increasing its interests in television. The new service would have two main sources of news. London-based Reuters Television, formally Visnews, would provide international newsgathering resources and BBC World Service Television would contribute international news and programmes made for Spanish-speaking audiences in association with the BBC's Latin American Service. Mr Joaquin Blaya, president of Telemundo, said yesterday in New York the formation of the service would be 'a milestone in Spanish-language programming which would revolutionise Latin America from an information point of view'.</p>

			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Next Next is an undeserved prisoner of its past. Investors remember the punishment which followed their love-affair with the company in the 1980s, and live in fear of a repeat performance - even though Next's successes are now based on more solid foundations. How much more solid was emphasised by yesterday's stellar set of interim results, which perversely served to trigger a 5 per cent fall in the share price. Admittedly the chairman was cautious on the outlook for sales growth, but the slowdown from the current 13 per cent does not mean growth is set to peter out. On the contrary, Next is increasing its retail and catalogue sales faster than its competitors. The City consensus suggests high operational gearing will take pre-tax profits to more than Pounds 100m this year - close to the 1980s high point - and to more than Pounds 120m in 1995. Plans for expansion are reassuringly modest. The tentative four-store experiment in the US does not suggest Next is about to rush into trouble in the tricky north American market. The current management's performance has been honoured by a nineteen-fold increase in the share price since its 1991 low point, a performance that obviously cannot be maintained. It is, however, quixotic that the shares should be on a sub-sector rating, when the earnings outlook is better than for the sector as a whole.</p>

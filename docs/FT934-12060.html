			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / A pile of money in search of a home: The public clamour for a stake in the Singapore Telecom privatisation Public disturbances are rare in tightly controlled Singapore. But share frenzy has been sweeping across the island republic. The centre of attention has been the partial privatisation of Singapore Telecom (ST). The government valuation of SDollars 30.5bn will make it Singapore's biggest quoted company, accounting for 20 per cent of total stock market capitalisation. 'For a company with a domestic market of less than 3m people and only limited investments overseas, a valuation of that order is a considerable achievement,' says one telecommunications analyst. 'But it's really more a reflection of the enormous amount of funds available for share buying within Singapore - backed up by the weight of equity investment funds washing in from overseas.' Earlier this year the government announced a relaxation of strict rules governing the use of funds held by Singaporeans in the central provident fund (CPF), a compulsory savings scheme. More than SDollars 20bn of additional CPF funds were made available to buy shares. Group A ST shares, sold at Dollars 1.90, are available to Singaporeans to buy through their CPF accounts. The initial limit of 600 shares each is being increased by the government. Group B shares are available to Singporeans at SDollars 2 each, with a limit of 1,000 shares per applicant. Group C shares are causing the most excitement. These are available by way of a single strike price tender at or above SDollars 2 each. Such has been the interest, there are fears that a 'freak' high price could be set. 'You'd be mad to bid above SDollars 3.50 a share,' says one foreign broker. 'But the way this sale has been hyped, and given the amount of money around, anything could happen.' While foreign fund managers involved in Asian markets are anxious to include ST in their investment portfolios, many are being cautious about the tendering process and prefer to wait for a secondary market to develop. Some foreign buyers object to paying more than Singaporeans, while others point out that even the basic launch price sets an unduly high prospective price-earnings ratio of 27. But indications are that it is Singaporeans themselves who are leading the rush to put in tenders for the Group C shares. Singapore is sitting on a mountain of savings. It has foreign exchange reserves of more than USDollars 40bn. CPF assets are now put at SDollars 50bn. More than 90 per cent of the population own their homes, and the roads are full of expensive cars. Share buying is one of the few avenues left for Singporeans to use up excess funds. There are dangers lurking amid all the market euphoria. The government deliberately structured the ST sale to encourage long-term share ownership. Yet the likely success of the issue, in part due to a government sponsored publicity campaign extolling the benefits of share ownership, could defeat the government's objectives. Analysts say that if the Group C strike price is much above the SDollars 2.50 mark, group B shareholders will probably quickly offload their shares. If the price goes above SDollars 3 then some group A shareholders might also be tempted to forego their future discounts and sell. Earlier this week, Mr Goh Chok Tong, the prime minister, said there was no doubt that some Singaporeans would get get their fingers burnt. 'The balloon will have to burst some time.'</p>

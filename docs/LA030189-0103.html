			<p><P> March 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Mike Tyson's return to the ring against Frank Bruno didn't translate into a  box-office success Saturday night, and a Las Vegas Hilton executive said the  resort will think twice before hosting another Tyson bout until a credible  opponent emerges.  </P> <P> Others in the boxing business say they too will pass on future heavyweight  title mismatches unless site fees are lowered dramatically from the $7 million  the Hilton paid for the bout.  </P> <P> Hilton officials said they lost several million dollars on the live gate  because many fans and gamblers weren't willing to pay the average ticket price  of $700 for a fight they perceived as a mismatch.  </P></p>

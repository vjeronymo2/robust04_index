			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Lower rates set off strong spending rise Lower US interest rates are sparking a strong increase in consumer spending on durable goods, official figures indicated yesterday. The Commerce Department said retail sales rose by 0.4 per cent last month and by 7.1 per cent in the year to November. However, sales of durable goods  -such as furniture, household equipment and building materials - rose by 0.9 per cent and 13.7 per cent in the same periods. Car sales were down fractionally last month, following a 5 per cent gain between September and October and a 14 per cent increase in the past year. Durable goods are sensitive to interest rates because most consuemrs borrow to finance most purchases. The figures are not adjusted for inflation, which is running at an annual rate of just under 3 per cent in the US. Officials also sharply revised up sales figures for October to show a gain of 1.8 per cent from September, rather than 1.5 per cent as previously reported. Sales of durable goods rose a sharp 3.5 per cent. The figures are the latest in a series of robust economic statistics, including a sharp fall in the jobless rate to 6.4 per cent last month and big increases in factory orders and production. Mr David Munro of High Frequency Economics, a New York consultancy, said the sales figures pointed to growth of real consumer spending at an annual rate of 'at least 4.5 per cent' in the current quarter. However, he added, a reduction in the pace of consumer spending was likely early next year because real disposable incomes were growing at an annual rate of only about 1 per cent. Retrenchment by consumers would lead to slow down in real economic growth from an annual rate of about 4.5 per cent currently to 2-3 per cent.</p>

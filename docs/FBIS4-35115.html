			<p>BFN     [Text] The suspension of U.S. radar services has increased  the limitations of the antinarcotics fight in Peru, but the  situation is not as severe as it may seem.    Everything indicates that the withdrawal of U.S. radars in  Andoas and Iquitos in March 1992 was an important setback.    The U.S. radar in Yurimaguas, which was to be a key weapon  in  the antinarcotics air fight, never amounted to anything. Since  its installation in February 1993 the radar had suffered several  malfunctions, which put it out of operation on several occasions.    Under optimum conditions the radar should have been able to  detect up to six targets at once in a 200-mile radius. This  radar never functioned properly, however.    This radar is 32 years old. It dates back to 1962 and is of  very inferior quality to the one the U.S. Government installed  in Peru in 1991. The other two radars, installed in Andoas and  Iquitos in November 1991, were withdrawn in March 1992.    During this period 12 small planes with drug shipments were  seized, and dozens detected.    Originally it was thought that the same successful results  that were obtained with the radars stationed in Andoas and  Iquitos would be obtained with the Yurimaguas radar, but it was  not so. The Peruvian Air Force [FAP] and the U.S. Embassy were  also not unaware of the serious defects affecting the radar.    The Yurimaguas radar merely served for dissuasive purposes.  To avoid the radar's range, drug traffickers were forced to use  longer but safer flight routes.    At any rate, the U.S. Government has also dismantled the  Yurimaguas radar.    According to an FAP study, however, four radars in good  working condition are needed to effectively control the air  space in the region.    The FAP, however, does not have sufficient means to conduct  this type of air interdiction program. Commenting on the impact  of the controversial U.S. Government decision, a high-ranking  FAP officer, who was barely able to conceal his regret, states:  "We were left virtually blind."    These limitations are not new, however.    In addition to the fact that the Yurimaguas radar was 50  percent inoperative because it was relatively outdated, the FAP  has experienced equipment restrictions.    Nevertheless, the FAP has used in full all the resources  available to combat drug trafficking, in compliance with decree  Law No. 25426. This decree entrusted the FAP with air  surveillance of the jungle region, the neutralization of secret  landing strips, and the control of air fields in coca producing  areas.    To fulfill its detection and interdiction operations the FAP  resorted to the use of combat planes used for training cadets.  To this effect the FAP permanently allocated four Tucano T-27  planes, while two Cessna A-37's were sporadically used for this  purpose.    Other means the FAP uses are the Y-12 and T-41 light planes,  which are also insufficient for carrying out this work. These  planes are in charge of granting logistics support, but this  should really be carried out by larger planes.    After more than three years in operation all of these planes  have deteriorated and have lower performance than the planes  used by drug traffickers. Unofficial sources state that a Tucano  plane, for example, develops a speed of 200 knots and flies at  26,000 feet, while a small plane develops a speed of 300 knots  and flies at 30,000 feet. Moreover, the navigation and  communication equipment is notably inferior to what is found in  the planes the drug traffickers use.    An officer states: "At first the Tucanos were efficient, but  now they have become obsolete."    In addition to the Tucano and Cessna planes, the FAP has  resorted to the use of helicopters for interdiction operations  in the jungle.    Only a couple of armed helicopters have been assigned to  this  task, however, because the majority of them are being employed  in antisubversive operations.    In view of this, U.S.-manufactured Bell-214 helicopters are  used to intercept and seize small planes.    In the beginning these helicopters did a good job, but they  became ineffective when in turn drug traffickers increased their  night flights. These helicopters lack adequate equipment for  night operations. Instead, the planes used by drug traffickers  are equipped with infrared systems, sophisticated communications  equipment, and even radar detectors.    The FAP has been able to acquire six night vision  units--each  worth $25,000--but because of their high cost their use is  restricted.    Like the Tucano planes, the helicopters have also  deteriorated. In addition, there were never enough of them. FAP  studies note that at least six helicopters are needed to  effectively patrol the region.    Since 1991 the FAP has been able to intercept, seize, and  capture about 200 small planes. This figure includes those  planes seized or intercepted through the Andoas and Iquitos  radars, and through the Yurimaguas radar which was recently  withdrawn.    With obsolete planes, without radars, and without adequate  technical assistance, the FAP continues to fight a better  equipped enemy.</p>

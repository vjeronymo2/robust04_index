			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Nuclear Testing: Balladur Disagrees </F> With Mitterrand"]    [Text] Prime Minister Edouard Balladur yesterday closed the  48th session of the IHEDN [National Institute for High Level  Studies] at the French Military School with a speech in which he  stated his views on defense. The text of his speech revealed  that he does not share the views of the president of the  Republic with regard to nuclear deterrent policy.    The prime minister did not rule out "the possible restart of  nuclear testing, depending on the international situation and  the behavior of the other nuclear powers," stressing that  "France never agreed to link the suspension of its nuclear  testing with the negotiation" of the Complete Test Ban Treaty  (CTBT). Mr. Balladur explained that this possible restart of  testing and "our involvement in the negotiation" of the treaty  "were not therefore incompatible." The prime minister reiterated  that, on 13 October 1993, he had told the National Assembly that  the government "would not subscribe to any definitive ban on  testing as long as it felt such testing was essential to the  technical credibility of our deterrent force."  <H5>  `Threshold' Countries </H5>   With these words, Mr. Balladur distanced himself from the  stance taken on nuclear testing by Mr. Mitterrand last Thursday  [5 May]. In a speech to 200 guests, including representatives  of the military establishment and arms manufacturers, the head  of state assured his audience that "for as long as he remained  in office, there would be no further testing." He also said he  was convinced that "afterward, they would not resume testing  because France will not want to offend the whole world by  restarting the arms race." He added: "I have confidence in my  successors; they will not be able to do otherwise," implicitly  referring to the upcoming diplomatic deadlines of the revision  of the Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) in 1995 and the conclusion  of a test ban treaty expected shortly afterward.    The prime minister also asked that the "threshold" countries  (those on the verge of acquiring nuclear arms) should  participate in the drawing up of the CTBT, something that is not  currently envisaged. Balladur argued that the "forum for  negotiation, which must be multilateral, should immediately  involve the threshold countries." He continued: "It is very  important for the disarmament conference to extend as far as  possible so that all threshold countries are represented." With  regard to the implementation of the treaty, Mr. Balladur warned  that it could only take effect if the threshold countries also  ratified it.    While the chairman of the committee charged with drawing up  the text for this complete test ban said at the end of March  that this treaty could be ready by 1995, Mr. Balladur emphasized  that "there was absolutely no fixed deadline for the conclusion"  of the treaty which is to "settle numerous and complex" issues.  The prime minister added that the government would oppose "in  particular linking the extension of the NPT at the May 1995  conference to the conclusion of a CTBT." He warned: "The  failure to extend the NPT could place question marks over our  commitment to a test ban treaty."  <H5>  Conscription To Remain </H5>   In addition, Edouard Balladur argued that the mixed army  system was "certainly not designed to be inflexible," even if,  "in the short- to medium-term, the Armed Forces cannot do  without conscription." Mr. Balladur continued: "The government  has made choices for the foreseeable future, some 15 years  hence," and he considered it "high likely" that "the system will  evolve in one direction or another after that time." As far as  the "modalities of this evolution" were concerned, the prime  minister said that he thought it was "wiser to firstly implement  the military programming law...before trying to imagine future  changes."    Nevertheless, the prime minister stressed that he "did not  believe" that a professional Army would "be sufficient to meet  French defense obligations and ambitions." He said: "France  has ambitions and responsibilities far beyond its national  borders...which require a large [defense system]." He pointed  out that a professional Army not only posed the question of  structural coherence in view of missions, but also of human  resources and cost.    With regard to staffing levels, Mr. Balladur estimated that  some 48,000 men would have to be hired every year if  conscription were to be abolished. He noted that the United  Kingdom had "problems recruiting 28,000 men per year." With  regard to cost, he explained that if forces were reduced by 20  percent as a result of total professionalization, there would be  an "annual additional expenditure of 20 to 25 billion francs."  He added: "Thus, unless the defense budget were increased  together with a tax on wealth, abolishing conscription would  lead to a drastic reduction in the size of the Armed Forces."</p>

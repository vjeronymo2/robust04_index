			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Government of Kyrgyzstan resigns The government of the central Asian state of Kyrgyzstan resigned yesterday, apparently to strengthen the hand of the pro-reform president, Mr Askar Akayev, against the conservative-dominated parliament. Mr Akayev has ordered new elections to the parliament before the end of the year. The sudden open confrontation between the reformist and conservative forces in the smallest of the former Soviet central Asian republics pits communist deputies, many of them representing the large Russian diaspora, against a minority in parliament who support the reformist strategy which Mr Akayev has struggled to push through. The country, one of the poorest in the region, introduced its own currency backed by a loan from the International Monetary Fund last year, and has reduced its inflation rate to 3.8 per cent a month in July. However, faster progress with reforms and a start to an ambitious, but stillborn, privatisation programme has been stymied by a majority in parliament opposing economic reform which will threaten the further existence of the rickety industrial sector reliant on continued state subsidies. The cabinet issued a resignation statement saying that government had become paralysed 'because of political games in parliament' which 'disturb social life and create tensions. The parliament has been unable to take decisions and thus interrupted its own work. The government considers it its duty to say that it supports the president's policies'. Parliament was due to convene for a final session of the year on September 27, when a new barrage of anti-government moves and resolutions would have been unleashed. Mr Akayev's announcement shifts forward the election date from February/March of next year to some time in the next five months. 'There is no way now for the opposition to organise before an accelerated election,' said one western analyst said in Bishkek, the capital. Mr Akayev stands in contrast to most central Asian leaders: he is not a former first secretary of the communist party, and has fully embraced market reform, though he lacks a strong industrial base and leads a country where natural energy and precious minerals are in short supply. The som, the Kyrgyz currency, has stabilised and the IMF has granted a three-year loan of Dollars 104m (Pounds 69m), the only one of its kind in central Asia. Attacks on the president point up the fact that, of the five central Asian states of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, only Kyrgyzstan permits an active opposition, a source of pride to President Akayev, but one which has thrown him on the defensive.</p>

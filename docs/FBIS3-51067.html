			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Foreign Ministry on Chiapas </F> Situation"]    [Text] Rome, 2 Jan (ANSA) -- The Italian Foreign Ministry  Foreign Office crisis committee, which has been following  developments after native Mexican rebels of the Emilio Zapata  Liberation Front occupied five towns in the southern Mexican  province of Chiapas, confirmed those rebels had withdrawn into  the mountains this morning, taking with them supplies of food  and medicines.    The Foreign Office also said that there had been  "considerably more" than the initial estimate of about 40  Italians staying in and around the town of San Cristobal de las  Casas, in Chiapas near the Guatelmalan border.    Most were said to be tourists traveling in groups, primarily  from Milan, Rome and the Veneto region. According to the Italian  embassy in Mexico City, most of the Italian tourists have by now  left the town aboard tour buses directed toward the capital of  the province, Tuxtla Gutierrez.    The Foreign Ministry's report confirmed that of Turin  resident Carla Astigiano, who had been in telephone contact  Saturday and Sunday with her husband Mario Paravano, staying in  San Cristobal with his business partner, Maurizio Albertini.    After a call from her husband Saturday to say he and other  foreigners were cloistered in the hotel, Astigiano had learned  from the hotel manager that today her husband and other Italians  had been evacuated for Tuxtla.    She later spoke with her husband around 19.00 Italian time  (18.00 GMT) and said he told her the region was heavily  patrolled by the Army.    According to some reports, there were six deaths and  numerous  injuries during the takeover of the five towns Saturday. There  were no reports of deaths among civilians or tourists, and  eyewitnesses said the rebels were careful not to involve  civilians in fighting.    Conflict between law enforcement agents and the estimated  200-300 guerrillas involved in yesterday's occupation was  expected to continue after the guerrilla withdrawal from San  Cristobal, a picturesque highland city with a population of  about 80,000 that is a growing favorite with tourists.    Although the Mexican government denies it, rebels among  southern Mexico's indigenous population have been fighting a  widening guerrilla war against the conditions of extreme poverty  and exploitation in which they live.    About one third of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the  Chiapas  province are indigenous peoples or `Native Mexicans,' and their  cause, represented by ethnic and civil rights organizations, has  drawn support from the north and south American clergy loosely  grouped under the `liberation theology' label.    The area is also one that has been intensely studied and  visited by anthropologists, some of whom have actively supported  the Indios cause.    But in an inquiry last summer, ANSA found that social  protest, largely unheeded by Mexican officials and mostly  ignored by the church establishment, was beginning to develop  into armed revolt.    The clandestine Zapata Liberation Front was reported to have  recently made contact with remnants of Procup [Clandestine  Revolutionary Workers Party - Union of the People], the  guerrilla organization active in Mexico in the 1970s.    Even after the Mexican Army mobilized 3,000 men last May to  hunt down a patrol of 40 guerrillas who had killed two soldiers,  the governor of Chiapas Patrocinio Gonzalez, continues to deny  that an armed guerrilla movement exists.    Gaspar Morquecho of Chiltac, a group that aids the Indios in  San Cristobal, said earlier this year that "an armed struggle  might be beginning" adding that "the crisis is driving the  Indios to the limit of their endurance."    Last August, when Pope John Paul II visited Merida on the  Yucatan peninsula during his American tour, the bishop of San  Cristobal, Monsignor Samuel Ruiz, sent a letter to the pope  warning him of the difficult conditions of the Indios in that  region.    Ruiz said there was a danger of "struggle and tensions" not  only in Chiapas but elsewhere in Mexico with indigenous people  suffering from the government's free market economic policies.    The San Cristobal cardinal, a leading exponent of liberation  theology has been accused by the Vatican of "doctrinal and  pastoral errors." Mexican sources say that condemnation was  pushed for by powerful local economic interests.    "Practically without hope" was how Padre Jorge Rafael, head  of the Dominican missionaries in nearby Ocosingo, an outpost on  the edge of the great central American Lacandona forest,  described the condition of a people who are forces to emigrate  2,000 miles away to Florida to survive.    Today's dead and injured were said to have been mostly among  police, in clashes said to have taken place in the villages of  Ocosingo, Altamirano, Chanal and Las Margaritas during  Saturday's takeover.    Not much is officially known about the Emilio Zapata  Liberation Front, named after the Mexican revolutionary figure  who lived from 1877 to 1919, apart from the fact that  yesterday's occupation force was said to number between 200 to  300, and may have some non-Indian participants.    Last July, native Mexican rights organizations criticized  the  Mexican Catholic church and the organization of the Pope's  approaching visit, saying it "only has meaning for the  government and for the church."    The church "despite the assassination of Cardinal Posadas at  Guadalajara, only wants to smooth things over at all costs,"  Genaro Dominguez, chief of the National Committee of Indian  Peoples, told ANSA.    (In a stunning attack on May 25, Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas  Ocampo, an outspoken critic of Guadalajara's violence and drug  culture, was shot and killed by narcotraficantes in a gun battle  outside Guadalajara airport.)    "If I were meeting the Pope," Dominguez said last summer, "I  would tell him to seek a real contact with indigenous peoples,  beyond formal meetings and without middlemen, to touch the real  truth of an extremely difficult situation that is quite  different from that which Papal Nunzio Girolamo Prigione is  likely to give him."    The `indios' continue to live with "starvation, insecurity  and exploitation such as existed in the time of Porfirio Diaz,"  Dominguez said, adding that in the Yucatan, "the native peoples  have by now been humiliated, whereas elsewhere a visit like this  could create problems."    Apparently, he referred to the growing rebel activity in the  neighboring province of Chiapas.    Press sources in Mexico City confirmed other rumors that the  rebels, although they had withdrawn from San Cristobal de las  Casas, continued to occupy the four other smaller villages  (Ocosingo, Altamirano, Chanal and Las Margaritas) in the  highland forest region near the Chiapas-Guatemalan border.    Government forces are said to be battling with guerrillas  this afternoon (local time).    A spokesman for the Mexican Interior Ministry said that "if  necessary the central government will take over the state of  Chiapas," but argued the fighting was "an isolated phenomenon"  and that the government "didn't intend to fall for the  provocation of this armed group.    Church authorities in the region meanwhile volunteered to  act  as mediators between the government and the rebels and appealed  to the guerrillas to lay down their arms. The local episcopate  has said it thinks the government should begin negotiations to  deal with the region's severe socio-economic problems.    Yesterday Mosignr Felipe Arizemendi, archbishop of Tapachula  in Chiapas, warned that "the poverty and conditions of  inequality in which many indigenous groups live has become a  breeding ground for a real insurrection. Extreme poverty is  always a threat to social peace," he said.    Emiliano (NB: not Emilio) Zapata, after whom the rebels  named  their band, remains a symbol of indigenous rebellion against the  latifundista land owners 75 years after his death.    Born in 1877, Zapata, who came from a humble family, fought  among the guerrillas who overthrew dictator Porfirio Diaz. A  great campaigner for social justice, he never supported the  revolutionary government of Francisco Madero and favored a more  radical expropriation of large land holdings.    Zapata's name is closely identified with the agrarian reform  that has still not been completed more than a century after the  Mexican revolution.    In 1919, Zapata was slain in the town of Cuernavaca on  orders  of president Venunziano Carranza.    In addition to the 6 deaths Saturday, another 10 persons are  said to have died in today's fighting between the Emiliano  Zapata Liberation Army and the Mexican army, sources in the  capital reported.    The skirmishes were said to be intense, with soldiers  mistakenly firing on an Red Cross ambulance at one point.    According to the Defense Ministry, the guerrillas, after  abandoning San Cristobal de las Cases this morning at dawn,  surrounded two military outposts about 10 km from the town.    Official sources placed the number of rebels at no more than  200 but press sources estimated 400-2,000. The rebels reportedly  intend to head toward the capital of the state of Chiapas at  Tuxtla Gutierrez.    Additional guerrilla forces were said to be continuing to  hold the towns of Ocosingo, Altamirano, Chanal and Las  Margaritas. At the airport of Ocosingo, where the rebels were  loading planes with supplies picked up during yesterday's  occupation of San Cristobal, hungry local residents were rumored  to have raided the guerrilla stocks.</p>

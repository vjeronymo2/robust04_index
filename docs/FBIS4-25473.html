			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 8 Jun (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- In recent  years, Beijing Municipality has set up a batch of enterprises  abroad, some of which have already cut a fine figure in the  intensely competitive international business world. It is  learned that at present, Beijing has 158 wholly foreign-funded,  joint-venture, or cooperative enterprises and organizations  abroad.    These overseas enterprises and organizations are distributed  over 45 countries and regions. Among them, 32 are in developed  countries and 126 in developing countries. Their investments  cover many fields, such as industrial and agricultural  production, exploitation of natural resources, general trade,  banking and real estate, tourist service, medical care, project  contracting, and landscaping and architecture.    In Malaysia, an overseas enterprise mainly formed by the  Beijing Municipal Building Works Group and the International  Economic Cooperation Company has developed into quite a strong  project contractor there. Its business ranges from undertaking  residential district projects to building four-star hotels and  from constructing exclusive apartment blocks to building factory  facilities. Its annual business volume approximates $100  million.    In Japan, the Jinglian Company reaped 27 billion yen of  turnover in 1993 and made a profit of 120 million yen, ranking  among 30,000 enterprises with good credit standing in Japan.    As a leader in exploring international real estate business,  the Beijing Municipal Real Estate Development and Management  Corporation has set up many companies in the United States,  Australia, Hong Kong, and Macao since it was founded in 1992.  Despite the adversities brought on by the continuing recession  in the Western economy and the real estate industry on a  downward path, they have managed to get a preliminary foothold  and shown relatively good economic performance.    The development and expansion of these overseas enterprises  have added a new dimension to the municipality's effort to  broaden the international market and strengthen itself with  overseas resources.</p>

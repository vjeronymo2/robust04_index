			<p><P> March 25, 1989, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> COURT SIZES IT UP -- SHERLOCK CAN STAY  </P> <P> It will be a happy Easter for Kaye Clarke and her obedience-award winning dog,  Sherlock.  </P> <P> That's because the Michigan Court of Appeals held Friday that a rule limiting  the size of dogs in her condominium complex is unreasonable and unenforceable.  </P> <P> The Bear Creek Condominium Assn. filed the suit to force Clarke, 47, to get rid  of Sherlock, a 24-inch-tall English setter. Association rules state that dogs  living in the complex cannot be more than 18 inches tall.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The new Moldovan Government at its first meeting in  Kishinev [Chisinau] on Thursday ruled to recommend to the  parliament to ratify the agreement on Moldova's entry the CIS  and the Economic Union in the near future.    Speaking at the meeting, Moldovan President Mircea Snegur  singled out the main aspects of the Cabinet's activities.    "It is not enough for the government to receive certain  powers from the parliament -- it should be effective,  functional, take decisions in time, offering draft laws and  necessary mechanisms and implementing them," the president said.    Snegur noted that the re-organization of ministries and  departments should be carried out "quickly and with a  considerable reduction of their personnel."    Snegur said that another priority is the preparation of a  Cabinet program for the next two-three years. He said that it  could be outlined by July 1 and should envisage the acceleration  of the restructuring and modernization of the national economy,  privatization and social support of the population.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Parliament June 28 SAPA -- The cost of South  Africa's first democratic elections rocketed from R286-million  [rand] to an eventual R1-billion (250 percent), Independent  Electoral Commission [IEC] Chairman Mr Justice Johann Kriegler  told the finance committee on Tuesday [28 June].    The increase was due to the introduction of a double ballot,  an staff increase from seven monitors to 22,000, and the Inkatha  Freedom Party's [IFP] decision in the final stage of the  elections to take part.    Mr Justice Kriegler appeared before the committee against  the  background of the total R4-billion transition-to-democracy costs  announced in last week's budget.    Outlining the escalation in election costs, the judge said  an  original budget of R286-million was derived from a "superficial  survey". After five weeks, a revised budget of about  R700-million was prepared for then State President F W de Klerk  and the Transitional Executive Council.    The R700-million was made up of R375-million for election  administration, R163-million for monitoring and R27-million for  voter education. "That was the budget with which we proceeded  until the eve of the elections," the judge told the committee.    At that stage a second appropriation document was prepared  asking for an additional R302-million which brought the total  budget to R1-billion.    The IFP's entry into the election meant an additional 549  voting stations had to be established. The IFP sticker affixed  to ballot papers cost R20-million.    The IEC had not yet finalised its accounts, but was  expecting  to do so by the third week of July. Thus far, the IEC had  accounted for expenditure of R825-million. It had R51-million  in outstanding payments and about R1.3-million in respect of  salaries. "We will either be within our end of April budget or  not substantially over that figure."    The judge said it had been impossible to mount the elections  operation cost-effectively in four months. There had been  excessive and wasteful expenditure. "Don't put any other  administration in this fix ever again."    Answering questions on why the elections had gone more  smoothly in white areas than in townships, the judge said that  in Soweto for example there had been uncertainty over the number  of voting stations until April 17.    The IEC had identified 237 stations but the then South  African Police had indicated that security could only be  provided at 180. The IEC eventually settled on 137. There was  also the disparity in the level of services and infrastructure  between black and white areas. At 90 per cent of the stations,  there had been no problems.    He said it was correct that the election had cost R50 a  voter. This compared favourably with a figure provided by the  Commonwealth of 13 US dollars per voter in countries where a  voters' roll was drawn up in tandem with an election.    He conceded that there had been losses and pilfering but  said  all IEC equipment had been insured. Less than 20 vehicles were  still unaccounted for.    Mr Saki Macozoma (ANC) said the IEC needed to be  congratulated for the work it had done. It had been seen by  many as a way of getting "easy money".    The judge warned against trying to run another election  without a voters' roll and said it would take eight months to  prepare one.</p>

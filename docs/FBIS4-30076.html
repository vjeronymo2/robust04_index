			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 23 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  said Thursday [23 June] steady implementation of stimulus  measures is needed to prevent a rapid strengthening of the yen.    The premier made the remarks at the House of Councillors  Budget Committee amid recent sharp gains by the yen against the  U.S. dollar.    "Enacting the national budget for the current fiscal year  and  promoting deregulation should stabilize foreign exchange rates,"  Hata said.    The 73.1 trillion yen budget for fiscal 1994 was to be  approved at an upper house plenary session later in the day.    Hata also told the committee that the government is taking  appropriate measures against the currency turmoil by maintaining  close contact with the Group of Seven (G-7) economic powers.</p>

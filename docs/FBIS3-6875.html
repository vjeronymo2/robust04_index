			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Australia has reiterated its backing for  international efforts over North Korea's refusal to allow full  international inspections of its nuclear sites.    Foreign Affairs Minister Gareth Evans says Australia  supports  any action the United Nations Security Council may consider  necessary in the matter. Senator Evans told the Australian  Parliament that this week's decision by the International Atomic  Energy Agency to refer the matter to the Security Council is a  measure of how seriously the internatioanal community is  treating the issue.    Sen. Evans also revealed Australia had expressed its  concerns  directly to North Korea.    [Begin Evans recording] We sent a message to North Korea  ourselves last Friday (?with the idea) to allow IAEA inspections  to be completed as a means of restarting the dialogue process.  Regretably, the DPRK has not so far seen its interest as  apparently being best served by proceeding in this fashion, but  we hope, as it has on previous occasions when the situation, the  pressure that is being mounted and the attitude of (?IAEA) and  the attitude of the international community is clear, that North  Korea will consider its position.

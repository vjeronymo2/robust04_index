			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / International Company News: Arcon boardroom dispute settled The boardroom upheaval at Arcon International Resources, the Irish company in which Mr Tony O'Reilly, chairman of Heinz Foods, has a 23 per cent stake, has been settled with 'an amicable and confidential agreement' and the immediate resignation of four directors. All four have been associated with the company since it was founded as Conroy International. They are Mr Richard Conroy, former chairman and chief executive; his brother Mr Desmond Conroy; Miss Maureen Jones, director responsible for administration and management; and Mr James Jones, director responsible for finance. Arcon issued an agreed statement saying they would 'pursue other business interests'. The boardroom split came into the open in October when Mr Richard Conroy, Miss Jones and Mr Jones, resigned their executive roles claiming that, in their opinion, Arcon had 'unilaterally and wrongfully repudiated their contracts'. Mr Brendan Gilmore, one of Mr O'Reilly's close confidants, was immediately appointed chairman and chief executive. Arcon is preparing to start a Dollars 65m lead-zinc mine at Galmoy in County Kilkenny, Ireland's first new base metals mine for 20 years. With his associates, Mr O'Reilly controls 29.9 per cent of the company while Outokumpu, the state-owned Finnish resources group, owns 21.6 per cent. Mr Richard Conroy, with associates and family, owns about 5 per cent. He set up Conroy, an investment company, two years ago. Among other interests, it has large mineral claims in Finland where it is looking for gold and diamonds.</p>

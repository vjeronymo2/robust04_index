While ministers of the senior coalition partner, the True  Path Party (DYP), have characterized Cindoruk's plan as  "fanciful," ministers affiliated with the junior coalition  partner, the Social Democrat People's Party (SHP), have pointed  to Cindoruk's claims of a potential crisis are being purely  speculative.    SHP Chairman and Deputy Prime Minister Murat Karayalcin told  reporters that Cindoruk was making speculative assumptions prior  to the upcoming local elections.    But, Karayalcin added, due to the preelection atmosphere in  Turkey, such speculation was predictable.    In Defense Minister Mehmet Golhan's reaction to the  proposal,  he reminded his audience that when Cindoruk had the opportunity  to become prime minister during the DYP's party convention in  1993, he declined the position in favor of Tansu Ciller. Golhan  said: "The existing coalition government shall continue.  Parliament Speaker Cindoruk could have become prime minister if  he wanted to. But, he had then proposed Ciller."    State Minister Obrahim Tez from the SHP, who also stressed  that the coalition government would remain intact after the  local elections, said: "This government should continue to  remain in power after the local elections for Turkey's  stability. The government may have some deficiencies, but we  are doing whatever is necessary to overcome them."    Agriculture Minister Refaiddin Sahin from the DYP wing of  the  government said he disagreed with Cindoruk's views.    Pointing out that only the DYP's competent bodies wee  authorized to call for early elections, Sahin said it was the  nation, as a whole, that would decided what to do after the  March 27 local elections. He added that whatever the nation  decided would be the most suitable and reasonable decision.    Sahin also stressed, in a reference to Cindoruk, that those  experienced in politics should not present illogical scenarios  or predictions that ignore political realities.    Main opposition Motherland Party (ANAP) Chairman Mesut  Yilmaz  said he and his colleagues agreed with Cindoruk's proposal in  principle, but disagreed with its duration and function.    In a press conference at ANAP headquarters, Yilmaz said he  viewed such a government as a temporary one, which should last  only as long as the law permits.    He defined this period as being no longer than either two or  three months.    He emphasized that the proposed one-year transition period  would not be able to solve Turkey's existing problems.    Yilmaz aid that debates over the establishment of a national  coalition should be conducted after the local elections and  noted that the fact that the issue had been brought up by a DYP  member proved that the ruling party was pessimistic about its  chances in the upcoming local elections.    Yilmaz said his party welcomed any proposal that would lead  Turkey toward greater stability.    Meanwhile, Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, who returned to  Turkey from her one-day visit to the besieged city of Sarajevo,  found herself in the midst of another preelection dilemma again.  This time she was faced with the possible resignation of former  Interior Minister and current Bursa Deputy Mehmet Gazioglu.</p>

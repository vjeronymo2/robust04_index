			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAULTY MILITARY EQUIPMENT IN MIDEAST  </P> <P> I first supported the aid and deployment of American troops to Saudi Arabia. I  felt the U.S. was supported by the United Nations, and President Bush was  indeed on the verge of creating a "new world order."  </P> <P> However, as the crisis has fallen from the front pages of the American press  and diplomatic efforts fall upon deaf ears, the news has taken on an ominous  tone.  </P> <P> The news which is now generated from the Persian Gulf includes stories of  expensive but ineffective hardware. Planes, helicopters, missiles and troops do  not function as planned or tested. The ability of the Apache helicopter to  function only 2 1/2 hours in combat is one example.  </P> <P> The initial deployment to the gulf has been replaced with news of downed  aircraft and presumed-dead stories. It's time to bug out.  </P> <P> DEAN J. BAGLER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

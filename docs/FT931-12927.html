			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Survey of Ukraine (2): Low international profile - Foreign Policy UKRAINE, the second most populous and powerful former Soviet republic, is a large question mark on Europe's eastern flank. Neither the west nor Ukraine has come to terms with the geopolitical significance of this fledgling country which possesses the largest army in Europe and shares borders with four eastern European nations. Part of the explanation for Ukraine's low international profile lies in the success of Ukraine's foreign policy. Widespread fear of overt conflict between Ukraine and Russia did not materialise. Thanks to the diplomatic skills of Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president, and the political restraint of his Russian counterpart, Mr Boris Yeltsin, quarrels over the rusting Black Sea fleet and the lush Crimean Peninsula did not erupt into a fight. The second reason for the west's oversight of Ukraine is less commendable. As diplomats stationed in Kiev are wont to remark sadly, their governments have not yet worked out where Ukraine fits into the redrawn map of Europe. One possibility, which senior American officials admit is favoured by some quarters in the US State Department, is that Ukraine, while nominally independent, could remain within the Russian sphere of influence. Ukrainian leaders, however, are adamantly opposed to such an outcome. In the 176 ICBMs stationed on Ukrainian territory they appear to have found a means of compelling the west to focus its attention specifically on Ukraine. The missiles, many of which are guarded by soldiers loyal to Kiev, are scheduled to be dismantled under the provisions of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (Start 1). But, while Ukrainian leaders remain committed to becoming non-nuclear in the long run, the parliament is stalling over ratification of Start 1 in an effort to extract financial assistance and security guarantees from the west. Ukraine's nuclear bargaining position has been strengthened considerably by the Start 2 pact with which Mr George Bush, outgoing US President, and Mr Yeltsin ushered in the new year. Without Start 1, Start 2 cannot go ahead. Thus, the international disarmament process, as well as the agreement on non-nuclear proliferation, depend upon Ukraine. However, horsetrading with ICBMs could backfire. If Ukraine takes an overly recalcitrant stance it could earn a reputation in the west as a bellicose and immature state for years to come. Worse, hardliners in Moscow could force a Ukraine-Russia confrontation over the nuclear missiles which might compel Ukraine not only to give up the nuclear weapons without further hesitation but also to surrender some of its independence in foreign policy. While the nuclear issue has the greatest ramifications beyond Ukraine's borders, for Kiev it is only the tip of the iceberg. Ukraine's understaffed and inexperienced foreign ministry must cope with the question of what role newly independent Ukraine should play in the world. In the first months of sovereignty, Ukraine pinned its hopes on close links with countries such as Canada and the US, home to powerful Ukrainian emigre communities, European nations such as Germany and France, and Ukraine's eastern European neighbours. But, as time wore on, Ukrainian leaders realised the west was in no hurry to embrace Ukraine. Kiev's focus has since shifted to the Middle East and Asia  -as exemplified by burgeoning relations with Turkey, Iran, India and China  -and an effort to renew economic, though not political, ties with former Soviet republics, including Russia. Even so, relations with Russia remain a sore point. Mr Leonid Kuchma, the new Ukrainian prime minister, has - with a sharp rejection of the nationalist rhetoric of his predecessor - made a point of re-establishing trading relations with Russia, Ukraine's most important trading partner and its principal source of oil. However, his efforts are imperilled by the insistence of some Russian leaders that working economic ties be accompanied by closer political links. This latent friction between the two Slav neighbours recently exploded at the Commonwealth of Independent States summit meeting in Minsk, where Ukraine clashed with Russia over its refusal to sign a new CIS charter which sought effectively to transform the organisation into a confederation. Ukrainian leaders fear that Russia will retaliate by cutting essential fuel supplies. If the influence of the hardliners continues to grow in the Kremlin, disputes over the military and borders could also erupt between Ukraine and Russia. Over the past year, the Russian military establishment has watched with impotent rage as Kiev has taken full command over the 650,000 soldiers who make up the conventional forces stationed in Ukraine and assumed administrative control over many of the strategic nuclear weapons stationed on Ukrainian soil. A resurgence of nationalists in Moscow could also unravel the delicate agreement reached this summer by Mr Kravchuk and Mr Yeltsin over the Black Sea fleet and, by extension, the Crimean Peninsula, which is part of Ukraine but eyed covetously by many leaders in Russia. A disagreement could also emerge over Ukraine's eastern territories, which border Russia and are inhabited by a large Russian minority. Ukraine's generous treatment of its 11m-strong Russian minority has already helped to avert conflict in these regions, but the tensions provoked in eastern Ukraine by economic reforms could disrupt the stability Mr Kravchuk has achieved with his sensitive handling of Ukrainian minorities. Unlike their confreres in the Baltic republics and central Asia, Russians have not suffered overt discrimination in independent Ukraine. Many key government posts, including the ministry of defence, are occupied by ethnic Russians. Other minorities have also fared well: Jewish organisations say that the Ukraine government is more helpful than that of any other former Soviet republic. Mr Kravchuk has created this relative ethnic harmony by espousing a new notion of what it means to be Ukrainian. In contrast with the Ukrainian nationalists' emphasis on ethnic Ukrainians, Mr Kravchuk has encouraged all inhabitants of Ukraine, regardless of their ethnic background, to consider themselves fully fledged citizens of the new state. His task in Ukraine's second year of independence will be to define the role of that state in the world at large.</p>

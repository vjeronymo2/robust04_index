			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Policy shift momentum begins to fade A WEEK of high drama and big swings in sentiment in the London stock market ended with share prices still on the upward track. However, there were distinct signs that the implications of the big shifts in policy by the UK Government over the past five days, plus the easing in monetary policy by the German authorities may now be fully discounted by the equity market. Sterling's continued strength against the D-Mark left the equity market firm yesterday, but not before the market had taken a hard look at the recent upsurge in share prices. The equity market began the session on an extremely cautious note with marketmakers, known to have been given a rough ride during the market's recent upsurge, happy to chop their opening dealing levels as a number of the big 'action' funds moved to lock in profits achieved over the past few trading sessions. Marketmakers were keen to absorb the early selling, which filled in some of the short positions built up during the recent rise in the market. At its worst of the day the Footsie 100 index was down over 18 points. However, the steep early fall encouraged at least two large UK institutions to return to the market as hefty buyers of many cyclical stocks. The burst of institutional buying, accompanied by general buying across the market as well as bouts of profit-taking saw the Footsie 100 advance to 2,677.0, a rise of almost 19 points, in mid-morning before it ran out of steam. Then, activity on both the buy and sell side dwindled and the Footsie 100 drifted into negative territory during the early afternoon before rallying and moving ahead as the week drew to a close. At its final reading the Footsie 100 was 11.6 higher at 2,669.7. Over the week, it has risen 105.8 points, or 4.13 per cent. This week, which has witnessed the fifth anniversary of the 'Great Crash of 1987' has seen Mr Major's Conservative Government change course on its wholesale pit closures and economic policy. The Prime Minister's new 'growth and recovery programme', coincided with an easing in Germany's monetary policy. Turnover yesterday, despite the early burst of institutional buying, totalled 586.3m shares, well below Thursday's 727.9m and Wednesday's 850m. But traders have been heartened by this week's sustained increase in the level of retail turnover. Customer business in London on Thursday was just short of Pounds 1.3bn. Customer, or retail, business increased this week as institutions have responded to the Government's 'dash for growth' policy.</p>

			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Consumer credit rises for July: Increase of Pounds 78m suggests slight recovery in high street BRITISH CONSUMERS unexpectedly increased their buying on credit in July, adding strength to anecdotal evidence that a slight recovery may be under way in the high street. The Central Statistical Office reported yesterday that lending to consumers by finance houses and other specialist credit companies, building societies and on bank credit cards under the Visa and Mastercard systems increased by a net seasonally adjusted Pounds 78m in July. This compared with City expectations of a Pounds 50m net repayment of consumer credit in July and a repayment in June of Pounds 55m. The amount of new credit advanced in July was Pounds 4.25bn, up from Pounds 4.16bn in June and the highest figure since Pounds 4.29bn in July last year. Several retailers have reported a slight easing of trading conditions in recent weeks but few are confident enough to declare a sustained improvement. Mr Derek Hunt, chairman of the MFI furniture chain, said yesterday: 'Over the past 18 months there have been many ebbs and flows in demand. Although we are up a bit at the moment there is no evidence on the table that anything will really improve this side of Christmas.' The upturn in consumer borrowing was welcomed by the Treasury and City, although analysts said it could have been helped by special factors. There was a modest rush to complete house purchases in July before the expiry in August of the suspension of stamp duty on housing transactions. This probably triggered increased buying of household items and furniture on hire purchase. Consumers may also have arranged credit agreements to finance new car purchases after the August 1 introduction of the 'K' registration numbers. Also, recent wet weather seems to have brought forward purchases of autumn and winter clothes. Net lending by finance houses and other credit companies increased by Pounds 56m in July after four months of net repayments. There was also an increase of Pounds 29m in net lending on Visa and Mastercard credit cards against Pounds 2m repayment the month before. The Treasury said the return to net lending in July after June's net repayment was a 'positive' sign. Mr George Hodgson, market strategist of SG Warburg Securities said yesterday's figures were good news, but merited 'one and a half rather than three cheers'. Company failures, Page 12</p>

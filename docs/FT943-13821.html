			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Media Futures: Blue-print for IBM in Europe - Hans-Olaf Henkel outlines his view of the future The recent fortunes of IBM in Europe have ranged from mixed to dire, but Hans-Olaf Henkel, president of IBM Europe, believes that the liberalisation of telecoms networks offers a 'tremendous opportunity'. Henkel was a member of the Bangemann group of industry leaders which reported to last month's Corfu EU summit on the essential steps to create an 'information society' in Europe. His view of the future is black-and-white. With open networks architecture and strong telecommunications competition, Europe will forge ahead. Without them, it will languish. He takes it for granted that high tech is the key to competitive advantage. 'Information technology will change the way we Europeans work, and fast,' he says. 'We still have 12 telecoms markets in Europe: they are fragmented mainly for protectionist reasons - in terms of companies and standards. We have to change that.' 'Governments have a key role to play, they can put Europe at the head of the information society or they can make us a follower behind the US.' Pressed on the precise role of government, Henkel sees it mainly in terms of liberalising markets and harmonising standards. Should governments set targets for connecting public sector institutions, such as schools and hospitals, to the new networks? 'We did not consider that specifically,' responds Henkel. They would have to be reasonable targets. The main role of government in this area is to set an example.' He is an enthusiast for teleworking, and believes it will soon change working practices radically. 'The EU should use teleworking as the principal mode for its translation service. Why can't most of them work from home?' Henkel accepts that there is a 'certain amount of hype' around. 'We have got to find applications. Video-on-demand will be one of the first, but it is proceeding slowly.' He is nonetheless convinced that the future lies in networks, not in disc technologies such as CD-rom. 'If the telecoms networks were not so costly, CD-rom would not be attractive. From a global economic standpoint, CD-rom is an outdated means of transporting data.' What is IBM doing to hasten the information age? He cites the company's flagship project to provide 'superhighway' services between Bonn and Berlin, allowing Berlin to function as Germany's capital while a large proportion of the country's bureaucrats remain in Bonn. Other, smaller scale, projects include putting the entire Vatican library on-line, and an on-line video trial with the University of Geneva. He claims IBM is leading the industry in the adaptation of ATM technology for the next generation of hardware. On standardisation, Henkel's recommendation is for more 'user groups and consortia to develop market-oriented specifications'. 'Take Internet with its 25m users. Whether you like it or not, it is a standard. It needs improving in terms of privacy and security - but let's say it is a de facto standard, and make sure it fulfils the industry's needs.' Henkel sees the UK as a model for the EU's telecoms industry. 'On the Bangemann group we all felt the UK was getting ahead of the rest of the continent. The first thing is competition which will result in lower rates, and the competitors will also find the capital for the new infrastructure.' Who will provide the competitors to established telecoms operators on the continent? 'It is obvious to me that utility companies are the most natural competitors in the telecoms market. They already have networks, and the rights of way needed to lay new ones,' says Henkel. For IBM, increasing PC penetration in Europe is the key. It estimates that in the US there are 34 PCs per 100 citizens, in Europe 10 per 100. 'That is the key business opportunity.' Whether IBM is best placed to exploit it is, of course, another matter. 'The whole playing field is being changed. It will be increasingly difficult to separate IT from telecoms. But we are the pioneers,' Henkel insists.</p>

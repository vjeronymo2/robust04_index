			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Family doctors allowed to offer more services FAMILY DOCTORS who manage their own budgets are to be allowed to provide a wider range of services for their patients, Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, announced in the Commons last night. She said changes in existing regulations would enable them to undertake diagnostic testing and minor surgical procedures outside the scope of their current contracts without the need to form limited companies. Mrs Bottomley dismissed Labour charges that the National Health Service was 'in crisis' and said provision had been made for a record capital allocation of nearly Pounds 2bn in the coming financial year. A Labour motion condemning the 'growing crisis' in the NHS and attacking the commercialisation introduced by government reforms was defeated by 35 votes (316-281). Mrs Bottomley acknowledged concern over the action taken by some hospitals to 'slow down' admissions for elective surgery because of pressure on their budgets, but insisted that they should pace their activity more effectively throughout the year. She ruled out emergency allocations of additional funds, and called on hospitals to meet the challenge of managing their annual budgets in a way that ensured they were not exhausted after eight or nine months. Mrs Bottomley also announced that, to reinforce the drive to cut the waiting time for screening for breast cancer and other illnesses, Pounds 2m would be made available for pump-priming 30 innovative 'pacesetter' projects throughout the country. The health secretary reaffirmed that the government would take 'tough decisions' in formulating its response to the report by Sir Bernard Tomlinson that recommended the closure or amalgamation of some London hospitals. Promising that change would not be imposed by 'central diktat', she admitted that it would take time to correct the imbalance and distortions that had grown up over many decades. Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, claimed that with waiting lists worsening and operations being cancelled there was a 'real crisis' in hospitals. In a renewed attack on the removal of hospitals from the control of area health authorities through the conferment of trust status, he said they were non-accountable and completely undemocratic.</p>

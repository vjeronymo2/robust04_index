			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / Management: Standing out to fit in The lady on the right is wearing a designer number. Slabs of red and black are stitched into a fitted jacket, teamed with a sleek black skirt. Her companion sports a blue suit, tailored and demure, set off by a plain white blouse and pearls. It is eight in the morning and the early arrivals are rolling into Goldman Sachs, one of New York's leading investment banks. Stereotypical Wall Street dressing dominates the scene. Hair is neat but unadventurous. Nails are painted in discreet shades of pink. Skirts ride a maximum two inches above the knee. Shoulder-pads are de rigueur. The only jarring note is the running shoes - every New Yorker's standard outdoor wear. But these will be swapped for court shoes, once Manhattan's grubby pavements give way to Goldman's polished floors. 'The women executives are very well-made, and it's not as if they lose their sexuality,' says one 'resting' actress, now temping on Wall Street. 'I think it's a matter of individual taste, so long as it's professional', says Katherine Bristor, at one of the largest New York law firms. 'Some women here wear pants, some wear a very masculine tailored look.' Even this, she admits, marks a recent change. 'When I started at the practice, I felt more constrained . . . but now there are more women around.' On the west coast, Charmaine McClarie-Cox, who runs an image consultancy, agrees things are changing and recession means services have to be sold harder. 'Your marketing has to be better-honed.' she argues. 'How you dress for Chevron, say, is not how you dress if you want to win over a small businessman. You don't want to look like the FBI.' So what adjustment does she advise? 'Stand out while fitting in,' seems to be the message. 'If it's a navy blue suit, find an interesting stripe. Add more touches of colour. After all, if you play it too safe, you don't say anything, except that you're scared.' An article on the clothes men wear will appear shortly.</p>

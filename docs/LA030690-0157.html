			<p><P> March 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA JOB MARKET;  </P> <P> REPORTS FORM THE FIELD;  </P> <P> BUILDING A CAREER IN CONSTRUCTION  </P> <P> Southern California's booming construction industry has made it a magnet for  workers in the building trades. Those who can perform expert plumbing,  carpentry and electrical work are in demand and can carve out secure, lucrative  careers for themselves.  </P> <P> In all three fields, unions have helped wages and benefits keep pace with  inflation. Annual salaries for journeymen range from $30,000 to $60,000. Those  with no experience can advance rapidly through union apprenticeship programs,  starting at $6 to $8 an hour and reaching journeyman's level in four to five  years.  </P> <P> Joining a union can have advantages -- including health benefits and grievance  procedures in the event of a dispute -- but it is not necessary. Many shops and  construction sites offer on-the-job training, and some pay at union levels.  Others pay less and may offer fewer benefits. (Nationally, more than  three-fourths of construction work is non-union, according to the U.S.  Department of Labor.)  </P> <P> In all three trades, dedication can pay off. Go-getters willing to acquire  extra schooling and work long hours can become foremen and supervisors. Such  jobs can carry six-figure salaries.  </P> <P> A brisk expansion of the plumbing industry in Southern California has made it  easier for aspiring plumbers to land spots as apprentices, said John Hall, a  business representative for the Plumbers Union Local 78 in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> While learning the trade, a man or woman with a high school education and no  experience can start off at about $6 an hour. Apprentices who are willing to  attend school two nights a week on top of their full-time jobs can build the  expertise that leads to a journeyman's license after five years and a  guaranteed wage of about $22 an hour.  </P> <P> Journeyman plumbers may choose to develop more expertise, which can carry even  higher wages. After Hall got his journeyman's license, he worked for 13 years  as a plumber and continued to attend classes, learning to do specialized work  in laboratories.  </P> <P> Along the way, Hall became a certified stainless steel welder and an expert in  computerized welding. Eventually, he became a general foreman. Working seven  days a week, 12 hours a day for a year and a half, Hall said he was making  $120,000 a year.  </P> <P> A career can also be built from on-the-job training without membership in a  union. Buddy Gohn, general manager of Jack Stephan Plumbing in Los Angeles,  said his company is "always looking for apprentices. We advertise in newspapers  for guys with mechanical ability to come in and start with us at $275 a week.  After 10 years they can be making $60,000 a year."  </P> <P> Wayne Murphy, 26, of El Segundo responded to one of those ads six months ago  and is happy with his progress. In his previous job as a technical illustrator  for Hughes Aircraft, Murphy made about $20,000 and felt he had no chance for  career advancement. In his new job, he sees a future.  </P> <P> "There's room for growth based on drive and willingness to work," he said.  </P> <P> Southern California's lively building industry also offers many job  opportunities to aspiring electricians, said Harvey Bachand, an organizer at  the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. And a shortage of skilled  electricians has made union membership easier to obtain, he said.  </P> <P> The electricians' union offers a five-year apprenticeship program with starting  wages of more than $8 an hour. It is open to high school graduates who are at  least 18 years old and who completed a year of algebra with at least a C  average. Apprentices work 40-hour weeks and attend school two nights a week.  After six months, their pay rises to more than $9 an hour. Annual increments  after that lead to journeyman's wages of about $24 an hour -- about $47,500  annually, based on a 40-hour-a-week, 50-week year.  </P> <P> But those wages are not guaranteed throughout the industry. Construction sites  usually pay more because most are controlled by union wage rules, but repair  shops are largely non-union. Repair shops pay a percentage of what the shop  charges the customer. Hourly wages average $14 to $18, considerably below union  scale.  </P> <P> Tony Fulton, an electrician with nine years experience, recently began work at  Ranier Electric &amp; Service Co. in Los Angeles for $30,000 a year. Fulton,  who is completing a two-year degree in electrical engineering, was unable to  rise above that ceiling, so he took a job calculating estimates for electrical  work instead. He expects to make $40,000 in his first year.  </P> <P> Although work on construction sites may pay more, it is not as steady, because  it is seasonal.  </P> <P> "The truth is that the average plumber or electrician makes closer to $35,000 a  year, even working union rates," Hall said.  </P> <P> As in plumbing added expertise in electrician work can pad a paycheck. There  are many areas of specialization, particularly in the computer and  telecommunications fields.  </P> <P> "Even if construction slows down, there will always be a demand for the highly  skilled people," Bachand said.  </P> <P> Carpenters also are enjoying big demand. The field is divided into two areas:  carpenters, who construct the buildings, and cabinetmakers, who do the  finishing work inside. Each field has its own union and apprenticeship  programs.  </P> <P> The two carpenters' unions offer four-year programs with hourly pay starting at  $8 and rising to nearly $22 for journeymen. The cabinetmakers' union offers a  four-year program, too, with entry level pay at about $5.50 an hour. Six-month  increments lead to a top rate of about $14 an hour. Rates are generally a  little lower in counties south of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Those considering careers in the building trades must also consider, however,  that if the pace of construction slows, the fields could become glutted with  workers.  </P> <P> But Hall predicted that demand for manpower locally could double by the  mid-1990s and will provide many opportunities for plumbers, electricians and  carpenters willing to "keep ahead of the pack" with extra schooling, especially  women and minorities.  </P> <P> "It's a good time to break in," he said.  </P></p>

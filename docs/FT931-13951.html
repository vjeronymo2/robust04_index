			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Inauguration of the President: Baton passes to practised hands - US administration's foreign policy team shows continuity THOUGH NOT as bitchy as academics, members of the foreign policy establishment in the US - and elsewhere - can be pretty sniffy when an outsider gets a position that really matters. Even today, any recollection of the freelance thoughts and activities of Mr Andrew Young, UN ambassador in the Carter administration of the 1970s, produces pained expressions among them. President Bill Clinton brings no credentials other than intellect to the practice of US foreign policy. But the team now mostly assembled to run it for him, under the aegis of Mr Warren Christopher as secretary of state, should flutter few diplomatic dovecotes. It is certainly not short of experience, even though the Democrats have been out of power for 12 years. It has continuity in the retention of some senior Bushmen, with Mr Edward Djerejian and Mr Dennis Ross remaining involved in the Middle East and Mr Bernard Aronson temporarily keeping the Latin American brief, mostly to deal with Haiti. The team is well stuffed with career diplomats, including those held over, even though some had moved out to the private sector. Mr Sam Lewis, ambassador to Israel for eight years under Presidents Carter and Bush, returns to run policy planning. Mr Winston Lord, once an associate of Mr Henry Kissinger and who was ambassador to Beijing until a few months before the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989, comes back to take control of Asian affairs. Mr George Moose, another professional diplomat and former envoy to Senegal, gets the African brief. It has a quota of outsiders. Ever since he was passed over for a cabinet post last month, Mr Tim Wirth, former senator from Colorado, has seemed a likely recruit. He is a man of eclectic interests and popular in Washington. His new role as counsellor in charge of a fistful of global issues, ranging from the environment to refugees, ought to test his talents. Likewise, Mr Strobe Talbott, the Time magazine journalist and Oxford classmate of Mr Clinton, has spent much of his career writing about the former Soviet Union, including a book soon to be published. This knowledge will be deployed in another new position as ambassador-at-large to the former Soviet republics, with particular emphasis on Russia. Mr Christopher has also placed those he knows particularly well in key places - such as Mr Peter Tarnoff of the Council on Foreign Relations who, as political under-secretary, is number three in the state department; Mr Thomas Donilon, an associate with the secretary of state's law firm who takes over public affairs; and Mr Stephen Oxman, now an investment banker but aide to Mr Christopher in the Carter administration, who gets the European portfolio. There are, however, three areas of potential controversy. Mr Lord, a Republican, has been very critical of China's post-Tiananmen policies. A mid-summer test of the new administration's approach to China will occur when Congress considers extension of most-favoured nation trading status. Mr Lord might well propose that this be more conditional on acceptable Chinese behaviour. There appears to be a fair-sized battle going on over the succession to Mr Aronson for Latin America. Favourite for the job was Mr Mario Baeza, a black Cuban-American lawyer from New York and a close friend of Mr Vernon Jordan, director of the administrative transition. However, opposition to his appointment has come from Mr Jorge Mas Canosa, leader of the Cuban community in Florida, who is reported to suspect Mr Baeza would be more inclined to promote a dialogue with President Fidel Castro of Cuba than work to overthrow him. Last - but by no means least for Washington insiders - the absence of any of the neo-conservative coterie influential in the foreign policy debate has been widely noticed. There remains the suspicion that most of the foreign policy ideas in the new administration will come from the White House National Security Council under Mr Anthony Lake and Mr Sandy Berger, with the State Department providing the diplomatic process. For all that, they all know each other well enough to avoid unnecessary tensions.</p>

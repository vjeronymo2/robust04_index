			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / De Klerk hints at shift in strategy PRESIDENT F W de Klerk last night held out the prospect of a critical shift in the South African government's strategy, warning that the constitutional talks were in jeopardy and raising the possibility of a referendum to replace a general election scheduled for next April. Mr de Klerk, addressing a regional congress of his ruling National Party in Stellenbosch, said that if political groups were unable to reach agreement on a new constitution in the next four weeks, before a scheduled special session of parliament, 'we must come up with another plan'. He added: 'As a democrat, I believe that there is no better instrument than a referendum.' Such a move, unlikely to be followed through without the backing of Mr Nelson Mandela's African National Congress, reflects a growing concern about the strength of the Freedom Alliance between right-wing whites and Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom party. The alliance is refusing to take part in the constitutional talks. Although its support is thought to be less than the combined constituencies of the ANC and the National party, it has the capacity to disrupt an election. A referendum would be less disruptive, allowing the government and the ANC to campaign as a de facto coalition seeking a mandate to govern as well as claim international legitimacy. Mr de Klerk easily won an all-white referendum on his reforms last year, which temporarily stalled opposition among whites to ending apartheid. The president was speaking hours after meeting leaders of the Freedom Alliance, which fears the ANC will win the election, scheduled for April 27, and impose a socialist system. They want autonomous homelands where they can govern themselves. Mr de Klerk said the negotiating process no longer represented the entire nation. 'The whole process of negotiation is under enormous pressure at the moment. It would be no exaggeration to speak of a crisis in the future.' The alliance called yesterday for a summit of all the nation's political leaders, in an apparent attempt to override the political negotiations led by the government and the ANC.</p>

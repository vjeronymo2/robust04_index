			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Colombian Petroleum Enterprise </F> President Juan Maria Rendon by Dario Arizmendi -- live]    [Text] [Arizmendi] Today, just as Carlos Rodado Noriega  announced, Colombian Petroleum Enterprise [ECOPETROL] will open  up for bidding by Colombian and foreign companies the  exploration of 3.7 million hectares. Previously, much of this  land could be explored only by ECOPETROL and was not open to  third parties.    An interesting process begins today. It will continue in  Houston, United States; Calgary, Canada; and, in approximately  two weeks, London. Three packages with information from three  regions will be presented. The regions are El Pie de Monte, in  Los Llanos; Magdalena's Valle Superior region, in Tolima and  Huila; and the Putumayo region. Each information package is  worth $20,000.    Colombia, as the newspaper EL ESPECTADOR reports in today's  Salmon Section, is going to go all the way to attract new  investors by means of more attractive contracts to build a sound  future as far as exploration and exploitation of oil goes.    We have ECOPETROL President Juan Maria Rendon on the line.  Good morning, Dr. Rendon.    [Rendon] Hello, Dario, how are you?    [Arizmendi] What do you and ECOPETROL expect from this probe  being initiated today?    [Rendon] The main objective is to attract new investors to  the country so that they can help Colombia get into this oil  business, which is characterized by high risks and heavy  investments. Colombia suitably decided 20 years ago to work on  this in conjunction with the private sector. Unfortunately, low  oil prices and the fact that China, Russia, and many others have  opened up to foreign investments like Colombia did appropriately  a long time ago makes it more difficult to find companies that  want to come here for exploration. The main objective is to  engage in a very aggressive campaign in the cities you mentioned  to visit the headquarters of the companies with our information  to secure oil production levels Cusiana will make possible.    [Arizmendi] How many foreign companies are expected to join  the exploration process?    [Rendon] We do not have any fixed estimate, but we hope that  10 or 15 new companies come to the country.    [Arizmendi] Dr. Rendon, After this initial process that  covers the three big regions we just mentioned -- the Pie de  Monte of Los Llanos, Magdalena's Valle Superior, and Tupumayo --  will information be prepared on other regions of the country for  similar exploration activities?    [Rendon] This year we will work on this process only,  basically. We are going to wait for results. Possibly next  year we will work on a new bid.    [Arizmendi] Current contract conditions are attractive  enough  to compete with nations like China and Russia?    [Rendon] These countries we have mentioned, plus Argentina,  Peru, and others, are working on this under very special  conditions because previously they had not considered foreign  investment to develop the oil industry. The state was doing  that. Now they have come to the foreign investment arena in a  very hearty way. Their conditions are special, and it will be  difficult for Colombia to match them. We have produced  conditions we think are attractive. They are based on the  country's economic stability and on the respect we always show  to companies, plus the fact that this country is attractive  because of the Cusiana oil breakthrough which we think will be  successful.    [Arizmendi] Much has been said about Cusiana and (Cucuagua).  The country has to start thinking about what will happen after  the year 2000. Exploration activities have dropped, probably  because of high exploration and exploitation costs and because  we are not being sufficiently competitive with other countries  such as China and Russia, as you have noted. What other factors  could exist with regard to Colombia's loss of competitive clout  with foreign investors?    [Rendon] Companies go to countries that offer revenue  possibilities and respect for the rules of the game. These are  two factors on which we want to make emphasis. We have also  changed our attitude, from one that consisted of passively  waiting for the companies to come here, to a more businesslike  attitude of preparing reports on Colombia's potential to present  them at formal bidding sessions, like the ones we have prepared.  We will elect the winner after a public bidding that will  consider investment factors [words indistinct] in the country.    [Arizmendi] Will this international bidding include the  potential oil zones of Medina and Cundinamarca?    [Rendon] No. Those are reserve areas that have a high  potential and that ECOPETROL maintains for itself to develop in  the future. This is an area near Cusiana. We are looking for  ways of working on those fields by somehow forming an  association with a company willing to share risks and manage  investments. Oil wells there will cost $30 million each. That  is a very complex area. The budget for that operation could be  a bit difficult.    [Arizmendi] If foreign investment is necessary, why have we  renounced the support of Shell in Huila Department, as it has  just happened?    [Rendon] This is a legal matter more than anything else.  What happens with this company is that there is this contract,  signed over 30 years ago. It is based on outdated  circumstances, when the state [words indistinct] intervention.  Later Colombia went modern, and now foreigners and ECOPETROL  are partners and manage things jointly. After 30 years the  contract is over, and there has been a legal ruling. Shell  believes it can extend the contract. The State Council has said  no. In view of this, the government has decided that it cannot  extend the contract. It is not that we want them to leave.  Shell is one of the most important companies in the world. We  would like them to be in Colombia, with an even larger presence.  I hope we can understand each other. This is not a matter of  attitudes or of lack of compliance, but a legal matter.</p>

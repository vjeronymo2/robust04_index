			<p>BFN     [Text] Medellin, Colombia, 8 May (AFP) -- Following the  confiscation of explosives and ammunition and the arrest of 12  insurgents this Saturday in Medellin, Colombian Army and secret  police foiled a guerrilla plot to sabotage the approaching 29  May presidential elections.    The Medellin military command gave the details of this  Sunday's joint operation -- which they described as effective --  against possible sabotage of the electoral process. The command  also announced the arrest of the leader of the FARC  [Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia] Bolivarian Militia's  urban group and 11 other rebels.    The operation resulted in the seizure of 200 kg of dynamite,  19 16-caliber cartridges, five rolls of slow-burning fuse, and  882 9-mm bullets during a raid on a house in northeastern  Medellin, Colombia's second largest city.    Military sources have indicated that operations against FARC  groups in the Medellin urban area are directed at preventing  disruptions such as those that occurred during the 13 March  legislative elections.    The same sources also reported that there was significant  property damage but no casualties during the March terrorist  attacks against political party headquarters and the Venezuelan  consulate in Medellin.    The authorities stressed this Sunday that they intend to  continue the operations against subversives and explained that  the arrest of 12 Bolivarian Militia members and the seizure of  war material followed 90 days of investigations and intelligence  work.</p>

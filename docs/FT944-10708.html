			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / International Company News: Reliance merges businesses Reliance Industries (RIL), India's largest private sector company, yesterday consolidated its place as a leader in the plastics market by merging with two of its associates, Reliance Polypropylene Limited (RPPL) and Reliance Polyethylene Limited (RPEL). The directors of the three companies met in Bombay yesterday to finalise the amalgamation, which will come into effect from January 1 1995. Shareholders of RPPL and RPEL will get 30 and 25 RIL shares respectively per 100 shares, based on two independent valuations. Itochu Corporation of Japan, which helped Reliance set up separate plants for the two companies in 1992, will continue to be an investor in RIL and maintain its earlier agreements for export marketing rights. Reliance said it would now have the benefit of equity-funded projects with a short gestation period, without adding to its existing debt profile. RIL's weighted average equity will now increase to about Rs3.63bn (Dollars 115.5m) from Rs3.36bn as of March 31 1995, and the company's reserves will swell by over Rs6bn. Reliance is building a polypropylene plant, with a technology licence from Union Carbide of the US. It is due to be commissioned by the end of next year and will have an annual capacity of 250,000 tonnes. It is also building a polyethylene plant with a technology licence from Du Pont Canada. The facility is expected to be commissioned by early 1996, and will have a capacity of 200,000 tonnes. With these two plants added to RIL's manufacturing capacity, the company will be India's largest producer of both petrochemical products. The company said the commissioning of the plants had been timed to coincide with the start-up of the world's largest multi-feed cracker project, being built in Hazira in Gujarat.</p>

			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: New issues Investors seeking to take advantage of the housing sector's long-awaited recovery may want to study Graham Group, the builders' merchant which begins trading on March 8 with a value of Pounds 209.8m, writes Peggy Hollinger. This business has been starved of investment under its parent, BTR, and there is ample opportunity to improve margins. Graham, with its exposure to both the heavier timber and brick side of the business, and the lighter plumbing and kitchen sector, also is well placed to benefit from a pick-up in the housing market. There remain, however, concerns about Graham once the initial benefits of restructuring come through. The top team, while more than capable of addressing the present problems, does not have wide experience of builders' merchanting. Graham will also be up against far bigger rivals such as Wolseley. While well placed for recovery, questions remain also about the group's ability to manage the inevitable downturn. The inescapable feature of construction is its cyclical nature. Still, these are questions for two or three years from now. The shares appear almost certain to trade at a premium to the 183p offer price for the short term.</p>

			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Arts: Today's Television There is in Britain, particularly among the more influential, a widespread, albeit vague, feeling that it is highly dangerous to keep on proving that people have been wrongly convicted and wrongly imprisoned; it undermines faith in the police and the law. Even the eminent judge Lord Denning has expressed such thoughts. But it will surely be a dark day if journalists ever end their investigations, cease revealing such miscarriages of justice, and stop serving as a last resort for the desperate. Rough Justice comes up with yet another instance - Dave Smith and the Bordon Baseball Bat Murder - where it seems that the wrong person may have been jailed (10.00 BBC1). Radio has an interesting evening. At 7.05 Radio 3 starts the first broadcast performance of John Buller's new opera BAKXAI, relayed live from the London Coliseum. The Oath That Binds Us (7.20 Radio 4) tells of two doctors who trained at Birmingham University in 1938 and met again after a life spent in different countries. In Analysis (8.00 Radio 4) Peter Hennessy tries to work out what a fourth successive Conservative administration may mean for the way we are governed.</p>

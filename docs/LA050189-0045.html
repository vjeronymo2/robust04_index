			<p><P> May 1, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GUNMAN IN ENGLAND KILLS 1, WOUNDS 14  </P> <P> A man dressed all in black and armed with a shotgun went on a 15-minute  shooting spree Sunday in a northeastern coastal town, killing one man and  wounding 14 people before being arrested, officials said.  </P> <P> Police were questioning the man to determine the motive for his rampage in  Monkseaton, about a mile from the Whitley Bay seaside resort and 250 miles  northeast of London.  </P> <P> The gunman, who was not identified, roamed the streets shooting at anyone he  saw, including one person in a car, another on a bicycle, one in a garden and  one outside a church, said a spokesman for a local ambulance service.  </P> <P> "There must have been about 12 different locations given where this man had  gone round," said Ken Heads, superintendent of the Northumbria ambulance  service.  </P> <P> Witnesses said the gunman was dressed all in black, with dark sunglasses and  his hair in a pony tail. They said he wore an ammunition belt around his waist  and prowled the streets for 15 minutes, pausing only to shoot.  </P> <P> After the shooting spree, he drove to a pub, where authorities seized him  without any gunfire, police said.  </P></p>

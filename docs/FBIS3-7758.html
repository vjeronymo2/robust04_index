			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Atif Agic from Bugojno] </F>   [Text] This morning at 0650 [0550 GMT] the chetnik air  force again bombed residential areas in Bugojno. The air raid  was carried out in three sweeps, causing great material damage.  After dropping their load, the chetnik bombers flew off in the  direction of Donji Vakuf.    Since 1745 last night the chetnik artillery has been  pounding  the residential areas of Bugojno, and this was repeated early  this morning during the chetnik air raid.    All the defense lines of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army  fighters  from Operative Group West are firm and alert.    As for the Gornji Vakuf front, the cease-fire is largely  holding, at least as far as the artillery is concerned. Snipers  are still active, and something should be done about these  criminals, as that is in the interest of both sides.</p>

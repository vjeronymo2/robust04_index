			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Delors jobs optimism MR Jacques Delors, the European Commission president, said in Luxembourg yesterday he was convinced the EC could reduce mass unemployment, which is 'paralysing European societies'. This would be achieved through a mix of job-sharing, part-time work and wage flexibility, according to the latest draft of the White Paper on competitiveness, growth and employment. The Commission has set a target of creating 20m new jobs by end of this decade, in its blueprint for tackling mass unemployment in Europe. The White Paper is being co-ordinated by Mr Delors. It will get its first real airing at this Friday's Brussels summit, but the final version will be the centrepiece of December's meeting of EC heads of government. The creation of 20m jobs, to reduce current EC unemployment rates of 10.4 per cent to 5 per cent by 2000, would match the performance of the US economy throughout the 1980s. It implies annual growth rates between 3 and 3.5 per cent, levels which are not likely to start until 1995. The Commission draft calls for a fundamental overhaul of EC labour markets, and an increase in investment from 19 per cent to 23-24 per cent of Community GDP, last seen between 1964-74. Among the chief recommendations are: New incentives for part-time work. This would reduce the average hours worked and allow the number of jobs to increase. Greater wage flexibility, including possible dilution of minimum wage legislation. Employment costs. The paper says labour should not be taxed more heavily than capital, and calls for a progressive reduction in non-wage costs for lower-skilled jobs. New taxes on pollution and energy to compensate for revenue losses as a result of reducing employment costs. A target of 3 per cent of gross national product to be spent on research and development; annual spending of Ecu30bn (Pounds 23.3bn) to Ecu35bn on transport infrastructure; and the creation of a European network of science parks.</p>

			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / Risk and Reward: Secondary market investors turn to eastern Europe As the secondary market in Latin American commercial bank debt has matured and become more expensive, successful investors in that market have turned to eastern Europe. 'The LDC debt market relies on the improvement in economic management,' said Mr Mark Evans of ING Bank, 'and that process is clearly under way in eastern Europe.' Trading volume in eastern European debt has surged this year as the market rallied. Poland's commercial bank debt has been actively traded for a number of years, but Russia and Bulgaria both defaulted on their debt more recently. Continental Bank estimates that trading volume in Russian debt will have grown from around Dollars 800m in 1992 to between Dollars 3bn and Dollars 4bn in 1993, while annual volume in Polish debt is around Dollars 15bn. The scope of the market's investor base is also growing rapidly. 'The market has broadened from hedge funds and specialist LDC boutiques to portfolio managers, and, particularly in the last six months, to investors in North and Central America,' said Mr Igor Sitnin of Continental Bank. Low interest rates may spell good news for most companies, but they leave investors starved of high-yield investments. In the quest for yield, they have extended the maturity of their bond holdings, bought 'junk' bonds and ventured into the emerging bond markets. The eastern European secondary debt market 'offers the next big opportunity,' claims one bank salesman - but it is also a highly volatile market. Even Polish debt, the most mature market, has ranged between a low of 24 1/2 cents in the dollar and a high of 39 cents. (When Bulgaria defaulted on its bank debt in 1990, the price of the debt fell from 95 cents to 5 cents in under a year.) But the magnet for investors is that potentially there are large gains to be made, if the experience in the Latin American debt market is to be repeated. Investors who bought Russian Vnesheconombank debt at the turn of the year for 15 1/2 cents in the dollar have seen their investment more than double to 36 1/2 cents. Mr Paul Luke, head of developing country research at Morgan Grenfell, points out that Russian bonds, which were never in default, have performed particularly well. He argues that Russian bonds are not likely to be rescheduled. 'Looking forward, it would take an extraordinarily severe foreign exchange crisis or complete political melt-down to oblige Russia to cease paying on its bonds.' But the outlook for further strong performance in eastern European debt is also viewed as positive. 'Russia is talking to the London club and has promised Dollars 500m in payments this autumn,' said Mr Sitnin. 'If that payment goes ahead, there is room for significant price improvement.' Bulgaria is also talking to its banks while Poland is expected to go ahead with a Brady-style debt agreement. Traders say the market will be vulnerable not only to the progress of debt negotiations, but also to the performance of the Treasury bond market. Low interest rates also make it easier for countries to pay their interest. Veterans of the Latin American debt market are ready to ride any potential storms. The notional principal value of foreign currency and interest rate swaps outstanding at the end of 1992 reached Dollars 4,600bn, an increase of 19 per cent over year-end 1991, according to a market survey conducted by Arthur Andersen for the International Swaps and Derivatives Association. The increase in swap activity came mainly from trade in non-US debt instruments. Capital at risk in a swap is the cash flows it generates, usually two to four per cent of its notional value. In the second half of 1992, new interest rate swaps contracts increased by 14 per cent over the first half, to a notional value of Dollars 1,500bn. Foreign exchange swap volume declined by 6 per cent from the first half, to Dollars 146bn. ISDA said a decline in short-term interest rates in the US appears to have reduced the demand for interest rate swaps among corporate end-users.</p>

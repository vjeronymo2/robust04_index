			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Joem H. Macaspac] </F>   [Text] The country is now officially bound by two tax  treaties with India and Spain, Executive Secretary Teofisto  Guingona Jr. said.    Guingona said the Philippine Senate, the country's treaty-  ratifying body, has already given its concurrence to two  conventions entered into by the Ramos government with the two  countries.    The agreements involve the avoidance of double taxation and  the prevention of "fiscal evasion" with respect to taxes and  income.    The Senate's concurrence was contained in Resolution Nos. 69  and 70, which were passed by the Senate before it adjourned for  the Lenten season, Guingona said.    The RP [Republic of the Philippines]-Spain Convention and  the  RP-India Convention were entered into and signed by the  respective representatives of the two governments in Manila on  14 March 1989 and 12 February 1990, respectively.    Then President Corazon C. Aquino signed the Instrument of  Ratification and forwarded the Conventions to the Senate  pursuant to Section 21 of Article VII of the Constitution  requiring the concurrence of at least two-thirds of the Senate  before any international agreement or treaty becomes valid.    Among the salient features of the RP-Spain Convention are:  -- In the Philippines, only income tax applies, whereas in  Spain, the coverage includes income tax on individuals and  corporate tax;    -- Provisions of taxation of income from dividends,  interests and royalties given preferential rates of tax which  are designed to stimulate the flow of investments into the  country;    -- With respect to personal service income, the Convention  gives the country of residence the primary right to tax the same  while giving the country where the services are rendered mere  shares in the revenues under certain conditions; and    -- Provision of a mutual agreement procedure on  administrative remedies in resolving difficulties in the  interpretation of the tax provisions; an exchange of  information provision aimed at facilitating cooperation between  the two countries in the assessment or collection of,  enforcement or prosecution in respect of, or the determination  of appeals in relation to, the taxes to which the Convention  applies.    On the other hand, the RP-India Convention's highlights  include:    -- In the Philippines, only income tax applies while in  India, the coverage includes income tax, wage tax, company tax  and dividend tax;    -- Provisions on taxation of income from dividends,  interests and royalties give preferential rates of tax which are  designed to stimulate the flow of investments into the country;    -- With respect to personal services income, the country  of residence is given the primary right to tax the same while  the country where the services were rendered are given mere  shares in the revenues under certain conditions; and    -- It stipulates a mutual agreement procedure on  administrative remedies in resolving difficulties in the  interpretation of tax provisions; and an exchange program  provision aimed at facilitating cooperation between the two  countries in the assessment and collection of, enforcement or  prosecution in respect of, or determination of appeals in  relation to, the taxes to which the Convention applies.</p>

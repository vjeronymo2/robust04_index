			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / International Company News: Canada forest groups improve in third term CANADIAN forest products companies improved their results sharply in the third quarter, due to good building materials markets and a lower Canadian dollar. However, their performance for all 1993 will be volatile. The industry has been fighting recession and weak prices since 1989, its last good year. Building materials were the first to rally early this year, with rising US housing stocks helping integrated companies and specialised Western timber producers. After a summer slowdown, construction timber prices are rising again as inventories are rebuilt. Noranda Forest posted third-quarter profits of CDollars 6m, or 2 cents a share, against a loss of CDollars 17m, or 16 cents, last time. For the nine months it had a loss of CDollars 42m, or 38 cents, after a net charge of CDollars 58m on the sale of its 49 per cent stake in MacMillan Bloedel. This compared with a loss of CDollars 62m, or 55 cents, on revenues of CDollars 1.13bn (excluding MacMillan), against CDollars 3.3bn. MacMillan Bloedel, the most diversified group, lost CDollars 20.7m, or 19 cents, in the third quarter, against a loss of CDollars 14.2m, or 15 cents. Nine-month profit was CDollars 48.1m or 39 cents, compared with a loss of CDollars 32.3m, or 35 cents a share. Abitibi-Price reduced its third-quarter loss to CDollars 25.3m, or 36 cents a share, from Dollars 73.3m, or Dollars 1.06, a year earlier on sales of Dollars 485m, up 10 per cent. The nine-month loss was Dollars 72.3m, or Dollars 1.05 a share, against Dollars 148.7m, or Dollars 2.16. Revenues were Dollars 1.45bn, against Dollars 1.23bn. Donohue, an eastern Canada newsprint producer, earned CDollars 1.3m, or 3 cents, in the third quarter, against a loss of CDollars 5.9m, or 18 cents. Nine-months profit was CDollars 9.7m, or 26 cents, compared with a loss of CDollars 17.1m, or 57 cents. Doman Industries, the timber and pulp group, earned CDollars 11.2m, or 30 cents, in the third quarter, against CDollars 132,000, or 9 cents. Nine-month profit was CDollars 38.7m, or CDollars 1.14, against CDollars 21.4m, or 70 cents.</p>

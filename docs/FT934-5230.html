			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Tietmeyer in prices warning The recent decline in west German inflation will be slowed next year by rising charges for local government services and indirect taxation, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president, warned last night. The central bank would remain alert to guard against any danger of a more general increase in prices, he told economists in Zurich. However, he indicated that the central bank believed the monetary situation was stabilising. Money supply growth had been following a 'more normal' route for several months, he said, and had moved 'strongly' towards the upper end of its target range since the summer. The prospects for prices were brightening. The November cost of living index had shown a year-on-year increase of 3.7 per cent, and in the last three months consumer prices had risen at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of around 2.5 per cent, he said. He reminded his audience that the central bank had started reducing interest rates last autumn when, although money supply was far above target, prospects for inflation were improving. Mr Tietmeyer claimed current policy, although based firmly on the growth of money supply, was flexible and never driven by parochial considerations. 'We do not try to hold money supply on course, come hell or high water, in the short term,' he said. 'Missing targets does not automatically lead to money policy feedback.' His remarks, two days before the Bundesbank central council is due to meet and consider interest rates, seem likely to encourage expectations of a reduction in the internationally-sensitive 5.75 per cent discount rate. Private-sector economists, despite being regularly caught wrong-footed by council decisions, expect a further reduction either this week or on December 16, the date of the last Bundesbank meeting this year, at which a key task will be to set targets for money supply growth in 1994. Underlying inflation is forecast to ease markedly next year as a result of real pay cuts across much of industry. Forecasters have been encouraged by individual deals such as that at Volkswagen where a nominal pay cut of 10 per cent has been accepted.</p>

			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / Moscow's mayor quits to seek new challenge PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin has accepted the resignation of Moscow's mayor, Mr Gavriil Popov, a former comrade-in-arms who wants to try demolishing socialism in Russia at large because doing it in the capital alone is too difficult. The departure at the weekend of one of the pioneers of Russia's anti-communist movement just one year after his direct election to the post means the loss of a controversial ally for Mr Yeltsin. The stocky economist, whose disdain for ties is matched by an equally idiosyncratic political style, said he wanted to campaign in national politics in the run-up to an autumn referendum on whether Russia should have private land ownership and a strong presidency. But Mr Popov has resigned to head a weakling Russian Movement for Democratic Reform (another unpromising attempt to encourage party politics in an arena dominated by strong personalities). An avowed democrat who acted like an autocrat, Mr Popov is believed to be positioning himself for higher office before his failure to deliver concrete benefits for Moscow's 9m inhabitants tarnishes his image nationwide. 'He considers that the latest steps, including new cabinet appointments, by Yeltsin are very dangerous,' said Mr Arkady Murashov, the Moscow police chief who is also thinking of resigning following the departure of his patron.</p>

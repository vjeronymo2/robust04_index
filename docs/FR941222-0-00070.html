During the experimental period, the NLRB will amend its rules to give the Chief Administrative Law Judge discretion to assign a judge other than the trial judge to conduct settlement negotiations with the parties, and to give the settlement judge certain powers necessary to engage effectively in those settlement efforts. The NLRB will also, during the experimental period, modify its rules to give ALJs assigned to hear a case the discretion to dispense with briefs, to hear oral argument in lieu of briefs, and to issue bench decisions. The rule changes will expire at the end of the one-year experimental period absent renewal by the Board. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> effective dates: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  February 1, 1995 through January 31, 1996.

The NPR provided for a comment period ending October 7, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Board received eight written comments on the NPR. The comments were received from a variety of sources, including unions, employer associations, practitioners, and the academic community. The comments were mixed, with some supporting some of the proposals but not others, and others supporting none of the proposals. Having carefully considered these comments, for the reasons discussed below, the Board has decided to implement the proposed changes with certain modifications for a one-year experimental period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> I. Settlement Judges  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposal on the use of settlement judges proposed to amend &sect;102.35 of the Board's rules to include provisions for the assignment of ALJs to serve as settlement judges. The comments on this proposal were mixed, with two comments opposing the proposal, two comments supporting the proposal, and two comments suggesting that the proposal be modified to require the agreement of the parties. (The other two comments made no comment on the proposal.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The comments opposing the proposal generally expressed the view that the proposal was unneeded and unlikely to yield significant benefits given the Agency's already high settlement rate. The comment submitted by the AFL&hyph;CIO also expressed the concern that the proposal would diminish the availability of trial judges, cause the postponement of hearing dates, and have a negative effect on settlement discussion at the Regional level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The Board acknowledges that there are potential problems which could arise with the use of settlement judges. The proposed rules, however, were drafted to minimize any such problems by requiring the assigning judge to consider, among other factors, the likelihood that a settlement may occur, the good faith of any person making a request for assignment of a settlement judge, and whether the assignment is otherwise feasible. The Board indicated in the NPR that among the factors which the assigning judge could consider would be the effect of an assignment upon agency resources, whether the assignment is being sought for, or would have the effect of, delaying the proceeding, and whether the assignment might tend to undermine other pending settlement efforts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  As suggested by some of the comments, a further safeguard against abuse of the procedure would be to condition the use of settlement judges on the agreement of all parties. The proposed rule did not include such a condition or otherwise permit a party to veto the use of the procedure, but indicated that a party's opposition was a factor for the assigning judge to consider in assessing whether to appoint a settlement judge. Having considered the comments, however, the Board agrees that the rule should state clearly that the procedure should not be used unless the parties agree to it. This should further minimize the potential for problems of the kind discussed by the AFL&hyph;CIO.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  In view of the Agency's lack of experience with settlement judges, however, the Board has decided to implement the procedure at this time for a one-year trial period. If significant problems arise with the procedure during that period, those problems may be considered by the Board in considering whether to implement the changes permanently. <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

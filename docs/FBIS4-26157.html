			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Clifford Lo and Ng Kang-Chung in Qianshan] </F>   [Text] At least eight workers ordered by their Hong Kong  bosses to retrieve cotton from a fire-damaged Zhuhai factory  were killed when it collapsed yesterday.    Shopkeepers next to the Hong Kong joint-venture factory said  they saw the bodies of eight workers covered in blankets next to  huge mounds of rubble. Soldiers, Public Security Bureau (PSB)  officers and hospital workers were searching for an estimated 40  others early this morning.    Another 40 were in hospital, many with broken limbs.    The Yue Sun Textile Factory -- a joint venture between a  Hong  Kong merchant and the Zhuhai Qianshan Industrial Company is in  the Qianshan Industrial Zone about eight kilometres north of the  Macao border. It is one of the largest in Zhuhai.    Two weeks ago in nearby Shenzhen 11 people died when a  partially-built plastics factory collapsed.    PSB officers were refusing to comment but sources at the  scene said the workers were ordered back into the factory  yesterday by their Hong Kong bosses to salvage cotton damaged in  the blaze which gutted the factory on Thursday. They said  workers could be seen throughout all six storeys of the building  as it crumbled into a three-storey pile of rubble about 2 pm.  Rescue work was delayed for 30 minutes after debris caught fire  at 9 pm. Diggers and cranes moved in, allowing a human chain  formed by survivors to reach one man, screaming as his head  popped above the rubble.    Shopkeeper Chang Kamyick, 18, said: "On the third floor I  saw  at least 20 workers. I heard a huge bang like an earthquake and  I turned and saw the building collapse within two minutes.    "Ten workers ran out but others were trapped. One man only  had his head above the rubble. He yelled for help and a digger  went in to rescue him.    "Many workers joined hands to pull him out. Others stayed to  look for survivors. Minutes later officials arrived to help."    Other sources at the scene said the fire-damaged building,  which supported heavy machines on its middle floors, appeared to  be weakened after a four-hour downpour. Maintenance worker,  Liang Yuyang, 25, who was pulled unconscious from the wreckage  and rushed to hospital, said that when the building had  collapsed around him he had thought it was the end.    "I had been going round the edge of the site, when suddenly  I  felt as if a water fall was gushing around me.I thought I was  already dead but I woke up in the hospital a few hours later."    Mr Liang had been taken to the Xiangzhou Hospital in the  back  of a truck before being operated on for multiple injuries  including a broken leg. He said he had been working for around  one year and until yesterday had felt that the management was  good. Earlier in the evening the Mayor of Zhuhai, Liang  Guangda, visited some of the victims in the Xiangzhou Hospital.    Labour groups in Hong Kong reacted strongly, criticising the  decision to allow the workers to re-enter the factory before  ensuring it was safe.    "It was irresponsible behaviour," said the chief executive  of  the Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims,  Chan Kam- hong.    A fire had raged through most of the factory building on  Thursday, but no casualties were reported. Firemen from Zhuhai  and nearby cities put out the fire at dawn yesterday, and  workers returned to remove damaged yarn from lower floors.  Others were working outside the building. At about 2 pm after  torrential rain and strong winds, the front half of the building  collapsed. Zhuhai public security authorities sent hundreds of  officers and firemen to rescue the victims, and sealed off a  section of the highway to Guangzhou for ambulances and rescue  vehicles.    A spokesman for Zhuhai City People's Hospital said most of  its patients had minor injuries. Many had been treated and  discharged. Factory director Yeung Chi-kwong refused to comment  on why workers were allowed back into the scorched building,  saying management still had to clarify many questions. He said:  "We can't answer your questions at the moment, because of  administrative reasons."    Zhuhai residents gathered to see whether relatives were  among  the casualties.    The factory was one of the largest in Zhuhai and employed  more than 2,000 workers, most of them from Sichuan and Hunan  provinces. Portuguese news agency Lusa in Macao said it was a  300 million yuan (HK$267.6 million [Hong Kong dollars] )  investment.    Zhuhai Labour Bureau director Guo Boquan said preliminary  investigations showed the fire had been related to welding.</p>

			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PARRISH SIGNS FOR 3 YEARS WITH ANGELS;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: FREE AGENT CATCHER, 33, DECIDES TO REMAIN IN ANAHEIM WITH A CONTRACT  WORTH $6.75 MILLION.  </P> <P> After taking a new look at his options, Lance Parrish decided the view is best  right where he is.  </P> <P> Parrish, who was granted "new look" free agency last month as an offshoot of  baseball's second collusion case, signed a three-year deal with the Angels  Wednesday worth $6.75 million.  </P> <P> The 33-year-old catcher, who was the foundation of the pitching staff's  outstanding performance last season, earned a base salary of $1 million for  1989 and added $210,000 in bonuses. He hit .238 in 124 games with 17 home runs  and 50 RBIs, and his .993 fielding percentage was tops among catchers who  played more than 95 games.  </P> <P> Under his new contract, Parrish will receive a $500,000 signing bonus, a salary  of $1.75 million in 1990, $2.25 million in 1991 and $2.25 million in 1992. He  may have undermined his leverage by publicly saying he wanted to stay with the  Angels, but he knew he wouldn't have been as happy anywhere else.  </P> <P> "Maybe I hurt my own case, but I wasn't too concerned about that," said  Parrish, who waived his right to free agency when the Angels acquired him from  Philadelphia in October, 1988, but was awarded another chance by arbitrator  George Nicolau.  </P> <P> "I felt the Angels treated me very fairly. I never was concerned about cutting  myself short. They realized I could talk to other clubs. Some clubs had shown  interest in me early, but the Angels were very earnest in their decision to  talk with me and get it done."  </P> <P> Had his batting average not faded late last season -- he hit less than .190  after Aug. 5 with only two home runs -- Parrish might have done even better  financially; his contract is not among baseball's top 10 in average annual  value. But Parrish, who attributed the decline to injuries he suffered in a  collision with Milwaukee's Glenn Braggs, has no regrets.  </P> <P> "I feel very fortunate the way things turned out," said Parrish, who graduated  from Walnut High School and lives in Yorba Linda. "Guys that are coming off  real, real good years are going to get big money, guys like Mark Langston and  Kirby Puckett, and if I would have had the kind of year I feel I'm capable of,  maybe I would have gotten more. But I have no complaints."  </P> <P> Nor do the Angels.  </P> <P> "He's a leader, and once you mention the word leader, that says it all," said  Dan O'Brien, the club's senior vice president of baseball operations and the  chief negotiator in the final stages of the deal. "The tempo and the concept of  the game revolves around the catcher, and Parrish is a real leader for us  there."  </P> <P> O'Brien said the Angels never feared losing Parrish, but were "concerned" about  keeping him happy. "We wanted him to stay and he wanted to stay, and that makes  it a little easier," O'Brien said.  </P> <P> The status of another prominent free agent, American League most valuable  player Robin Yount, remains unchanged. General Manager Mike Port said he has  not spoken with the Brewers' center fielder for nearly two weeks.  </P> <P> "It was left on the basis that Robin has some decisions to make and we're not  inclined to be intrusive," Port said. "It's not the type of situation where  you're going to change his emotions."  </P> <P> Port repeated that the Angels have not made Yount an offer and scoffed at a  report in last week's New York Post that quoted an unidentified scout as saying  the Angels had proposed a $27-million package that included a $5-million  signing bonus and a golf course.  </P> <P> A county circuit judge in Milwaukee is hoping Yount will give more weight to  sentiment than money: a plea to the city's children by judge Charles Schudson  has resulted in 6,000 letters from youngsters urging Yount to remain with the  Brewers.  </P> <P> Team president Bud Selig said Monday that he did not expect a decision from  Yount this week.  </P></p>

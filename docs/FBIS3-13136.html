			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn, March 10, IRNA -- A Palestinian doctor who is  now living in Germany has disclosed more details on the massacre  of Palestinian worshipers in Hebron on February 25.    Maysam Abu-'Ali, a former resident of Hebron, said that he  had been in the shrine at the time of the massacre and at the  hebron Islamic hospital after the incident. He noted that at  05:15 am Friday Barukh Goldstein together with at least six  other Zionists who were all in army uniforms attacked the mosque  with tens of hand grenades and then sprayed the worshipers with  bullets. About 53 worshipers were immediately martyred and 250  others severely wounded while seven others, trying to flee the  mosque, were killed and 40 others injured by heavy fire of the  Zionist soldiers outside the mosque, he added.    He dismissed the Zionist regime's claims that Israeli forces  had not cooperated with the attackers and said that the soldiers  opened heavy fire in front of the Hebron Islamic hospital on  Muslims who had rushed to the scene to donate blood to the  wounded, killing three and wounded 30 others.    On Palestinians reaction to the massacre, Abu-'Ali remarked  that despite extenive presence of the heavily armed Zionist  forces around al-Aqsa mosque, over 90,000 Palestiians turned out  to hold the Friday prayers in the mosque. In a demonstration  which followed the prayers, 17 Palestinian worshipers were  martyred and tens of others were wounded, the doctor said.    He continued that the Arabic translation of the message of  the leader of the Islamic revolution, Ayatollah 'Ali Khamene'i,  on the Hebron catastrophe, which was soon distributed in all  parts of the occupied territories, raised hope in the hearts of  the oppressed Palestinians.</p>

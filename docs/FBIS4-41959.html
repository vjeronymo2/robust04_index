			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev -- A plenary sitting of Ukraine's Supreme  Council began on 28 June. A tentative list of issues that will  be debated in the period from 28 June to 1 July was approved.    At the insistence of Oleh Vitovych, chairman of the  subcommission for human rights issues, deputies included in the  session's agenda the issue of temporarily halting the withdrawal  of nuclear weapons from Ukraine, with 141 votes in favor. The  Supreme Council Commission for Issues of Defense and State  Security was charged with preparing this issue for the  parliament's consideration.    In an interview with a UNIAN correspondent, Oleh Vitovych  said: "We consider that the largest countries, Russia and the  United States, should begin the process of disarmament  throughout the world and that all other states should follow  their example." In his words, the material and technical  aspects of "unilateral disarmament" do not benefit Ukraine; none  of the promises made by Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton at the  signing of the trilateral agreement with regard to the  withdrawal of nuclear weapons from Ukraine is being fulfilled.    In Oleh Vitovych's view, the biggest tactical and strategic  mistake made by the previous Ukrainian parliament was that its  deputies "took the liberty of hearing the view of the well-known  pacifist, Dmytro Pavlychko, who stubbornly forced the issue  through." Oleh Vitovych also said that he has had a meeting  with Leonid Smolyakov, Russia's ambassador to Ukraine, during  which he accused the Russian side of interfering in Ukraine's  internal affairs, particularly in Crimea. Vitoych considers  that only nuclear weapons could become the single guarantor of  peace on Ukrainian lands. He said: "There will be no war in the  country until the last warhead crosses the Russian border."    In Oleh Vitovych's view, the inclusion in the session's  agenda of the issue on temporarily halting the withdrawal of  nuclear weapons from Ukraine is proof that the overwhelming  majority of deputies have seen common sense and that they detest  President Leonid Kravchuk.    People's deputy Serhiy Dovhan, chairman of the Peasant Party  of Ukraine, expressed the assumption in an interview with a  UNIAN correspondent that deputies agreed to consider this issue  because they want information on the state of the withdrawal of  nuclear weapons and on how the obligations taken on by Ukraine,  Russia, and the United States during the signing of the  trilateral agreement are being observed.    In an interview with a UNIAN correspondent, people's deputy  Vasyl Durdynets said that the "inclusion in the Supreme  Council's agenda -- by a small group of deputies -- of such a  proposal does not in any way mean that the withdrawal of nuclear  weapons from Ukraine would really be halted."    Vasyl Durdynets is counting on the responsibility of those  who will prepare this issue for the deputies' consideration. He  also said that the Center deputies' group has still not  discussed its joint position on this matter.    Supreme Council Presidium member Hryhoriy Omelchenko  stressed  that "if Ukraine signed the trilateral agreement made by the  presidents and announced its non-nuclear status, then it should  be consistent in abiding by this position."    Hryhoriy Omelchenko noted that this also means the  implementation of the trilateral agreement by all three states.    The Union of Officers of Ukraine, of which Hryhoriy  Omelchenko is deputy head, has still not discussed this issue at  its meeting.    At Les Tanyuk's insistence, the issue of using a $500  million  dollar credit which was given to Ukraine's agro-industrial  complex, was also included on the agenda. In Les Tanyuk's  words, Oleksandr Tkachenko, first deputy chairman of the Supreme  Council, is directly involved in distributing these funds.    After this, deputies began discussing the introduction of  changes and additions to Article 7 of the Ukrainian law "On the  Militia". Leonid Borodych, chairman of the Commission for Issues  of Legality and Law and Order, argued the necessity of  introducing amendments, and said that the militia had recently  been used for political purposes and that it is implementing  someone's social orders. An example is Crimea where, as a  result of using the militia for purposes other than what it was  designated for, (protecting the president and his family) crime  has shown a tendency to increase. It is proposed that an  amendment be introduced to Article 7 in the following terms:  "The militia is subordinate to Ukraine's Ministry of Internal  Affairs and the minister exercises leadership over all militia  subunits in Ukraine." It is also proposed to form a main  directorate of Ukraine's Internal Affairs Ministry in Crimea and  a main directorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the  cities of Kiev and Sevastopol and in the oblasts within the  system of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.    Leonid Borodych is convinced that the possibility exists of  introducing such a body in the system of the Internal Affairs  Ministry without any forcible methods. However, some deputies  stressed that such a decision could lead to the situation  between Ukraine and Crimea becoming tense and that is why it is  necessary to postpone it until either after the second round of  presidential elections or until after the work on bringing the  Crimean constitution into line with that of Ukraine's has ended.    After the discussion the proposed amendment to the Ukrainian  law "On the militia" was adopted with a single remark -- the  directorate which is currently subordinate only to the Internal  Affairs Ministry will report to the local council about its  activities.</p>

			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Victory for Kohl in tax reform battle THE German government yesterday won approval for a big tax reform package intended to pump more money into the collapsed east German economy, largely at the expense of the west. The deal was pushed through in the face of bitter opposition from the Social Democratic Party (SPD) by uniting all the new federal states in the east to vote for an increase in value added tax from 14 to 15 per cent. The package also includes the first steps towards corporate tax reforms, including increased thresholds for company property tax and trade profits tax, intended to make industry more competitive in the single European market. The vote in the Bundesrat, the upper house of parliament, after weeks of deadlock, is a big victory for Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government. However, SPD leaders warned that it had only been achieved at the expense of further embittering relations between east and west. Victory for the government came after the last-minute decision by Brandenburg, the one state in the former East Germany ruled by the SPD, to back the package, along with neighbouring Berlin, ruled by a coalition of the main parties. Mr Manfred Stolpe, Brandenburg's Social Democrat premier, under fire himself for his dealings with the East German security police as a church leader before unification, swung the whole debate with a passionate speech spelling out the extent of economic collapse in the region. 'Do you really all begin to know the misery we are facing in the east?' he demanded. 'Is it really clear to you how critical this turning point is, where we stand in 1992? The demolitions are still going on. Companies are still closing down - every week, one, two, three or four. Every week, hundreds of jobs are being lost.' The tax package will mean an extra DM33bn (Pounds 11.4bn) in finance for the eastern states over the next three years, because the whole increase in VAT will be used to bolster the German Unity Fund. That will provide urgently need cash for job creation schemes. Mr Oskar Lafontaine, premier of the Saarland, said that the government had deliberately pitted the poorer states of the west, against all those in the east. The VAT increase would hit the lowest paid hardest, and aggravate the social tension in the country. It would destroy solidarity between east and west.</p>

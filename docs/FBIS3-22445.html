			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Ph.E." report: "Twelve Billion Francs Allocated to World </F> Environment Fund"]    [Excerpts] Northern and southern countries finally have  agreed on the operating procedures of the fund that will finance  projects in developing countries aimed at safeguarding  biodiversity and at fighting the green house effect.    After 15 months of intensive discussions, the 71 member  countries of the World Environment Fund [WEF] (representing 86  percent of the world population) have reached an agreement on  its budget, which will amount to $2 billion over three years, as  compared with the $800 million for the preceding pilot phase,  and on its operation, which will be made more democratic. These  two decisions were essential for the commitments made during the  1992 Earth Summit in Rio to retain a minimum of credibility.  [passage omitted]    France has committed itself to contributing 800 million  French francs [Fr], i.e., one-third of the U.S. contribution,  and to another Fr400 million for bilateral initiatives which  meet the WEF's regulations but which will be managed by the  Central Fund for Cooperation. These initiatives especially seek  to assist African projects, which for the time being are  enjoying little WEF support. [passage omitted]</p>

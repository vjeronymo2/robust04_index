			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / EC deficits 'threaten new currency chaos' THE EUROPEAN Commission yesterday warned that a fresh crisis in the exchange rate mechanism could be triggered if member states allow budget deficits to grow in order to counter rising unemployment. Mr Henning Christophersen, EC economics commissioner, called for tighter fiscal policies in 1994. A relaxation of fiscal discipline would damage the Community's credibility and could lead to tighter monetary policy, higher interest rates and new disturbances in the European Monetary System. Mr Christophersen was speaking on the day the Commission forecast that EC economies would shrink an average of 0.5 per cent this year, the worst performance since 1975. Growth next year is likely to be a modest 1.25 per cent, pushing unemployment in the EC towards 20m, according to the Commission forecasts. Employment is expected to fall by more than 1 3/4 per cent, the poorest figures in the history of the EC. One bright spot is the UK economy, which is forecast to grow 1.5 per cent this year and 2.5 per cent next year. Mr Christophersen agreed that Britain had enjoyed a short-term benefit from leaving the ERM, but he described the UK recovery as 'fragile'. At a news conference, Mr Christophersen justified his rejection of deficit spending to counter unemployment by pointing out that the EC's budgetary position remained precarious. The current level of government net borrowing is likely to increase to around 6 1/4 per cent of GDP in 1993. This is the highest recorded in the EC (it reached 5.2 per cent in 1982), and is more than double the target of 3 per cent set down in the Maastricht treaty for membership of a European Monetary Union. Despite the poor prospects for growth, Mr Christophersen insisted that it was still possible to reach the Emu goal, and he ruled out changing the convergence criteria on inflation, government debt and budget deficits set down in the treaty. Mr Christophersen said that reducing budget deficits was not being done 'to please people in Brussels' or to meet the Maastricht treaty's criteria for joining a monetary union. 'The biggest risk of a further relaxation of fiscal policies is that it will reduce credibility in other areas,' he said. Without naming the Bundesbank, Mr Christophersen said: 'There will be no further easing of monetary policy if you increase fiscal deficits. A tightening of monetary policy could lead to new disturbances in the European Monetary System.' His remarks underline the belief in Brussels that nothing should be said - or done - which might cause the Bundesbank to have second thoughts about lowering interest rates. Virtually all bets are being placed on lower German  -and European - interest rates in the next 12 months to revive the economy. Mr Christophersen said he expected inflation to edge down to an average annual rate of 4.25 per cent this year from 4.6 in 1992, and to keep falling to 3.75 per cent in 1994, making it easier to relax monetary policies and pave the way to lower interest rates which were a key to growth.</p>

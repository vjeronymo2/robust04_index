			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / International Company News: Foods group whets appetites for a sell-off / Examining one of Italy's most appealing candidates for privatisation and finds its chief executive is opposed to any such sale SME, the Italian state-controlled foods and retailing group, is one of Italy's most appealing privatisation candidates. With Mr Giuliano Amato's new government apparently more serious than its predecessor about asset sales to slash the budget deficit, SME's time may have come. The group, which is 62 per cent-owned by the IRI state holding company, made net profits of L125.6bn (Dollars 111m) after minorities last year on sales of L5,814bn. In none of the three areas in which it operates is it on a par with Europe's leaders. Food retailing, SME's biggest business and probably the most attractive to potential buyers, with sales of almost L2,500bn in 1991, is concentrated in the 221-store GS supermarket chain. Restaurants and catering, the smallest of SME's activities, with turnover of just over L1,000bn, could also be appealing, although the loss-making Motta operation could be hard for buyers to digest. Meanwhile, food production, with 1991 revenues of more than L2,300bn, remains SME's most difficult nut to crack. While the Italgel frozen foods subsidiary performs strongly, the CBD canned foods and oils side is still losing money. Privatisation is already under way. Last month saw the second stage in a three-step deal to transfer control of SME's Pavesi confectionery arm to Barilla, the big, private pasta group. Pavesi is the best-known of the four loss-making subsidiaries spun off into joint ventures with the private sector in 1990 in an attempt to improve profitability. 'The idea was to concentrate on a smaller number of businesses,' says Mr Mario Artali, SME's chief executive for the past two years. With current sales of almost L280bn, Pavesi has been by far the most successful of the four. The deal with Barilla, which bought an opening 49 per cent stake, allowed for the transfer of full control by 1993 at an agreed price of L240bn. Last month, the terms were altered slightly; Barilla bought a further 10 per cent for L80bn, giving it majority ownership ahead of schedule, and the two sides look set to conclude the full sale by next January. Mr Artali admits that Pai, Adams and Nuova Forneria, the three other joint ventures, are not going so well, and full disposals probably remain dependent on a return to profitability. However, he stresses food production is no longer the 'nightmare' it was when he joined. Setting up the joint ventures helped SME to concentrate on a smaller number of businesses, and progress has been made on improving earnings on the industrial side, partly by branching out into fresh milk. The Pavesi sale has given SME the financial cushion to complete the restructuring of its food industry side, he says. By rejigging the deal last month to avoid bunching capital gains into one tax year, SME can look forward to substantial extraordinary earnings for the next two years, giving it time to tackle remaining problems in food production. Mr Artali doubts further piecemeal privatisation is on the cards. Any decision to sell would have to come from the government via IRI. However, he makes clear his opposition to a sale. And if SME is to be privatised at all, it should be in one piece. Breaking the business up 'has no sense', he says. 'SME is too small, not too big.' Mr Artali cites Spain, where foreign, notably French, groups have made deep inroads into food retailing, to the detriment of the indigenous agricultural and food industry. Imports of processed food rose at the expense of domestic producers. 'It was a mistake for the country.' He also queries the financial arguments for privatising SME. Around 38 per cent of its shares are quoted, with a stock market capitalisation of about L1,700bn. But that substantially understates the value of the business, he argues. Placing the remaining shares would mean selling at a discount to the current market price, reducing the proceeds from privatisation. 'Prices on the Milan stock market no longer reflect the value of a company,' he said. Mr Artali's hope is for SME to stay public at least long enough to expand those parts of the group, such as food retailing and catering, which are doing well, while gradually improving the food production side. SME currently has about 8 per cent of the food retailing market in Italy. But although its GS chain ranks second only to the country's big co-operatives in food sales, Mr Artali thinks it is 'not sufficient'. Growth will come through expanding GS, concentrated in Piedmont and Lombardy in the north and Lazio and Campania in the south, into other parts of the country while filling in gaps where it is already well represented. The aim is to create new regional centres with sales of between L200bn and L300bn, he says. Acquisitions could accelerate matters. SME has already integrated two small supermarket chains bought in the past two years. And Mr Artali would also like to set up more hypermarkets: the first is opening this year and plans call for around two launches a year. Autogrill is also set to expand. The traditional motorway services business plans to develop abroad, while new domestic growth is expected through opening restaurants in new locations such as shopping centres. The company is even considering joint ventures - an unprecedented step  - and looking at eastern Europe, where the motorway network, and related services, offer prospects to expand. Mr Artali recognises the sizeable barriers to his plans. With only around 20 supermarket chains in Italy, chances for growth through acquisitions are limited. Moreover, prices are already sky-high and there are few sellers. Meanwhile, the pace of organic growth for both supermarkets and hypermarkets is restricted by planning rules and small retailers' hostility. With Italy's motorway network virtually complete, he also accepts the catering business has reached its limits in many domestic locations. Autogrill will have to pump more business through existing roadside sites, while foreign expansion, though appealing, will not come easily. Meanwhile, urgent changes are necessary at Motta, the inner-city restaurant chain whose earnings no longer live up to its famous name. Whatever the problems, SME has one big advantage over most of its public-sector counterparts. Its businesses generate cash, meaning it has relatively little debt and no need for heavy borrowing. Sales in the first five months of this year were 9.1 per cent up at L2,445bn, while earnings, swollen by extraordinary gains, should surge by at least 20 per cent to L155bn, according to Milan brokers Pasfin. SME's current L1,700bn three-year investment plan will be entirely self-financed, notes Mr Artali. In the end that, rather than politics, may be the main factor making privatisation less pressing.</p>

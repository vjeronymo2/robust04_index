			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Thorp revisited The decision by Hamburg's nuclear power utility to cancel some of its fuel reprocessing contracts at the UK's Thorp plant in Cumbria is an ominous sign for British Nuclear Fuels, Thorp's owner. The cancellation adds to scepticism about the long-term profitability of Thorp, which received its licence to operate a year ago after a bitterly contested battle between BNF and environmentalists. It may also represent the beginning of a change in governments' approach to nuclear waste disposal. Hamburg's action does not at first sight appear very significant. The utility has cancelled contracts for reprocessing waste from 2004 to 2014 and has paid undisclosed compensation. This follows a change in German law this year, which allows 'direct disposal' of nuclear waste underground. BNF says the contract represents just 1 per cent of its total orders, and 4 per cent of orders beyond 2004, and that the cancellation makes no difference to the economic case for Thorp. This was based entirely on the first decade's business. However, the move shows that the arguments for reprocessing nuclear waste may be losing their force. Reprocessing separates out reusable uranium and plutonium from used fuel rods, leaving a smaller amount of true waste. But it is more expensive than direct disposal, many claim. Moreover, the uranium shortages foreseen when Thorp was conceived a decade ago have not materialised, while international concern has grown about the proliferation of plutonium-based weapons capability. So other customers may follow Hamburg's lead, if they can find direct disposal sites at home. Hamburg's action also implicitly raises a taboo question: whether the most valuable service Thorp offers is storage rather than reprocessing. BNF's customers have already delivered many of the fuel rods for the next decade's reprocessing to Cumbria, where they sit in cooling ponds. The customers are obliged by their contracts to take back the products of reprocessing, but that may not be for many years. For governments which do not have a policy for permanent disposal, BNF is, in effect, performing a political favour: while removing their waste, it also shifts difficult decisions about final disposal on to future governments. The UK government would not wish to portray BNF's Sellafield site as a long-term store for foreign nuclear waste. But that would be no more than an acknowledgement of an important part of Thorp's role, which was hardly emphasised during the two public consultations on its licence. Such an admission would also allow the UK to ask itself whether it was charging enough for that service, given the political difficulty many countries face in finding permanent disposal sites. The value placed on reprocessing may have fallen, but the value of storage is rising.</p>

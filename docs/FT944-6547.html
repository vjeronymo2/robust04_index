			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Finance Ministry orders derivative transparency Japan's financial institutions will be required for the first time to disclose information about their derivative holdings, the Finance Ministry said yesterday. The disclosure rule is expected to focus on the type of derivatives contracts and their value, and could be enforced as early as next March, according to ministry officials. The market in derivatives, securities such as futures and options contracts, developed in Japan in the late 1980s. Trading in many widely-used instruments is highly circumscribed by the Finance Ministry, but Japanese banks and brokers have been active in developing a market in those derivatives that are permitted. In the last year regulators watched with alarm as the highly-geared nature of derivatives increased the exposure of companies to heavy losses. Earlier this month, one Japanese broker, Tokyo Securities reported that it had lost Y32bn (Pounds 207m) from contracts on currency options, a sum equivalent to more than a third of the value of its shareholders' equity. The authorities have expressed deepening concern about the market, as Japanese companies previously were required to give only sketchy details about their derivatives portfolios.</p>

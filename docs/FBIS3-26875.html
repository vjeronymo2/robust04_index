A DPRK representative today informed the IAEA that the DPRK  "accepts the inspection activities ...[ellipses as received]  requested by the IAEA in the seven declared nuclear facilities"  after months of negotiations, said David Kyd, spokesman for the  Vienna-based IAEA.    He said that the IAEA would send an inspection team of six  or  seven experts to the DPRK as soon as possible.    The team is expected to stay in that country for three weeks  and verify whether there has been any diversion of nuclear  fissionable materials into military use in those facilities  since the IAEA's last inspection in February 1993.    It was reported that the IAEA had formally requested to  inspect the seven facilities in January this year.    Suspecting that the DPRK is using the facilities to develop  nuclear weapons, the United States has threatened that country  with sanctions and with stationing "Patriot" anti-missile  missiles in South Korea.    But the DPRK has forcefully denied any manufacture of  nuclear  weapons.</p>

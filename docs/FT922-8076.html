			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Rebirth of a Leipzig capitalist: A businessman amid the ex-communist ruins RICHARD Kratzer turned a cardboard box of tiny plastic lorries on to the table, and handled one fondly: 'There's no market for them any more. In 1972, they earned me DM12m a year.' Today, at an age when many would be long retired, Mr Kratzer has taken up the daunting challenge of rebuilding the factory he was forced to sell to the East German government in May 1972. His company, Uniplast MK, was one of 13,000 firms commandeered by the then communist regime. He is now one of a handful still fit enough to have his factory returned to him. The task is to make something of its ruins. For Richard Kratzer, it was, literally speaking, ruins: an 'accidental' fire during the night before his return to the factory on the outskirts of Leipzig in April 1990 destroyed all stocks, the computer system with all company records, and all invoices, contracts and other important papers. The plastic moulding machines that were unchanged from when he left them 18 years earlier were standing deep in water. It was a month before he could resume any production. 'I have tried to rebuild what I can,' he says. Today, those same machines are pressing out simple plastic bottles, and plastic parts such as bottle caps as he mounts a range of makeshift operations to raise funds for a proper new business. Alongside the half-dozen vacuum-pressing machines is a large room stacked floor-to-ceiling with basic household items such as plastic waste-paper baskets, buckets and draining-racks for dishes - another makeshift operation, this time wholesaling between other east German companies and hardware shops in the Leipzig area. The profits from both activities are intended to fund a DM500,000 (Pounds 170,000) investment in what he hopes will be one of two businesses: making vacuum-moulded plastic doors. At present, this business consists of a one-room assembly operation, an outdoor concreted area where the future factory building will be, and a handful of commandeered shipping containers which have proved useful for rainproof storage. He hopes to start making doors this month. Apart from illustrating the grim determination needed of eastern Germany's former capitalists - and perhaps of those starting from scratch today - Richard Kratzer provides potent evidence of the fragile foundations of the industrial rebirth of Germany's eastern states. He has been forced to scratch around for equipment, funds, partners and markets. None has come easily. Funds have come not from the banking sector, but from the remnants of DM1.6m paid to Mr Kratzer in 1972 by the communists for his factory. After they had clawed DM1m for various 'expenses' linked with the takeover of the factory, the communists had left him with DM300,000 in a non-interest-bearing bank account. After knocking on doors across western Germany, he has found two potential partners in Europe. Metaku in Germany have agreed the joint venture making plastic doors for the east European market. The local construction boom expected in coming years from regeneration funds is forecast to create strong demand for house doors, and Metaku's plastic products cost barely half the price of a wooden door. Faber Jalousie in Denmark have given him a licence to make their Solarflor vertical blinds. One virtue of the Faber agreement is that a buy-back arrangement has saved Mr Kratzer the daunting task of finding his own market. 'Finding a market in eastern Europe is very difficult at present. There's no money,' he says: 'But in one or two years, with the rouble and other east European currencies more settled, then I think we can do good business. Even now, I'm making a profit - though all the money is going back into investment in new machinery.' Plastic doors and window blinds may not have the romantic appeal of miniature plastic lorries, but after 20 lost years, it is not romance that Richard Kratzer is looking for. His company was one of some 13,000 commandeered by the communist regime. He is one of a handful fit enough to have it returned to him 'There's no money. But in one or two years, with the rouble and other east European currencies more settled, then I think we can do good business.'</p>

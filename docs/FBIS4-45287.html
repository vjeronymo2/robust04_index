			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by special correspondent Ciro Miranda] </F>   [Text] A gigantic antinarcotics operation is under way in  Santa Cruz, Bolivia. Dinar [National Narcotics Directorate] and  the Paraguayan branch of the DEA are participating. A cocaine  processing laboratory was destroyed near the Paraguayan border,  some 40 km from Gabino Mendoza. It is presumed that another  laboratory is located somewhere on Paraguayan territory.  Several cars that had been stolen in Paraguay were found in a  sales lot owned by Bolivian drug traffickers.    The Special Antinarcotics Force (FELCN) broke up one of the  most powerful international drug trafficking networks. The  network was based in San Matias, some 180 km southeast of Santa  Cruz, and included Brazil and Paraguay. The FELCN also  localized and destroyed a clandestine cocaine laboratory near  the Paraguayan border.    The FELCN operation, which included the assistance of DEA  agents, began on 24 May. The Special Forces raided various  cattle stations, shops, and car sales lots, particularly those  selling Japanese cars which were presumably stolen in Paraguay.    A laboratory was found south of the Parapiti River, some 40  km from the Paraguayan border. At the time of the raid the  laboratory was processing 84.5 kg of cocaine base and 800 grams  of "angel dust."    The laboratory was owned by brothers Mario Enrique, alias  "Quique," and Luis Alberto Arteaga Seleme, alias "Pelon."    Once refined, the drugs were transported to San Matias,  where  they were prepared for shipment to Brazil (Corumba cartel) and  Paraguay. The drugs were also shipped by air through the Chaco  region, entering Asuncion from different directions.    According to official reports these operations involved  Paraguayan antinarcotics forces--possibly Dinar. This  association made possible the capture of the individuals  responsible for carrying the drugs to Brussels (Belgium) and  Madrid (Spain) for distribution on the European market, where  prices are higher than in the United States.  <H5>  Stolen Utility Vehicles </H5>   On 25 May the FELCN raided the "Autoshoping" [as published]  car sales lot located at the corner of San Aurelio and Segundo  Anillo Avenues in Santa Cruz.    The police found several Japanese-made four-wheel-drive  utility vehicles that had presumably been stolen in Paraguay and  paid for with cocaine.    In the yard, owned by "Quique" and "Pelon" Arteaga Seleme,  the police seized two Mitsubishi Montero utility vehicles, one  jeep of the same maker, various Honda vehicles, one new Toyota  minivan, and other vehicles. The police seized a total of 15  vehicles in the yard.    The confiscations continued at other premises owned by the  brothers Arteaga Seleme and their partners, the brothers  Wilfredo, Robin, and Ruan Rosales Agreda. The police also  raided the premises owned by a well-known high society family,  the Pedraza Ribera family.    The FELCN and the DEA also seized a "Beechcraft Bonanza"  light plane, equipped with a single engine BE-36, and with  license number CP-854. In the plane the police arrested Mario  "Quique" Arteaga Seleme, who was carrying thousands of dollars  in a sack, and another five individuals whose identities were  not revealed. The operation continues, and NOTICIAS will today  receive more information about it.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "European Commission Concerned Over </F> Kantor Report"]    [Text] (ANSA) Brussels, April 5 -- The European Commission  on Tuesday [5 April] expressed its concern over what it saw as  threats of sanctions against the European Union [EU] implied in  the report drawn up by United States trade representative Mickey  Kantor on alleged trade obstacles and said it would reply  point-by-point to the charges made against the European Union in  its own report.    Speaking to the press here, an official spokesman for the  European Union executive added how this year the report from the  U.S. trade representative was much better than previous years in  the sense that there was less criticism of the European Union  and even recognition that many problems between the United  States and the European Union had been resolved over the past  months. This is also due to the end of the Uruguay Round  negotiations to renew the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  (GATT) which governs world trade.    At the same time, the spokesman stressed how the European  Commission remain concerned over the threats implied in the  Kantor report, in particular those of sanctions in the field of  public contracts and the safeguarding of intellectual property.</p>

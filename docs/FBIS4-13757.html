			<p>BFN     [Text] A northern Yemeni official denied in Sanaa today  that military reinforcements were sent to the northern  al-'Amaliqah brigade which is stationed in the south, saying  planes are transporting only food and medicine to troops  stationed in the area.    The Yemeni official, who asked not to be named, said  northern  planes are now assuming this task because supplies for the al-  'Amaliqah Brigade were cut off by the southern 20th Brigade in  Mukayris, the point from which these items reached the Abyan  area north of Aden where the al-'Amaliqah brigade is stationed.    The north Yemeni official was responding to a Yemeni  Socialist Party [YSP] statement issued last night accusing  northern forces of sending reinforcements to the al-'Amaliqah  Brigade in the south of the country. The YSP statement said  seven helicopters carrying arms, military equipment, and troops  landed at the al-'Amaliqah brigade's military camp and that at  least 10 tanks and missile carriers were brought to beef up  northern army positions in the central part of the previous  border between the two parts of Yemen.    On another level, the Yemeni Army today attacked a site  where  the Jahm tribal elements have been detaining for one month three  Netherlands nationals in a mountainous area, 200 km east of  Sanaa. The Ma'rib district governor left for the site in an  attempt to release the three captives, who had been working in a  project to supply the capital with water. The kidnappers are  trying to force the Yemeni authorities to employ members of the  Jahm tribe in oil companies and the army.</p>

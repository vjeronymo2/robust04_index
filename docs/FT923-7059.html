			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Technology: Driven by devotion - British Entrepreneurs / Louise Kehoe finds a self-starter who is committed to business through thick and thin PETER RIGBY is no fan of venture capitalists. Indeed, this business builder prides himself in never having borrowed money to fund his Birmingham-based computer sales and services group - Specialist Computer Holdings (SCH). He admits, however, to having been tempted at times to 'cash in some chips' and sell equity to investors. 'I've had opportunities, but I believe that you cannot be half-hearted about business, you have to be totally committed, financially and personally, so I have always resisted. I am not interested in finding an 'exit route' as the financiers call it.' Financial gain is not the prime motivation for entrepreneurs, Rigby believes. He was driven, rather, by the challenge of proving his own abilities. 'I didn't want help or handouts, it had to be down to me.' Building a business is no easy path to riches, Rigby observes. 'It is almost all consuming. It occupies all of your thinking. You have to make sacrifices in terms of family life and personal interests.' Rigby first 'took the plunge' in 1975. Then in his late 20s, he traded a successful career in computer sales for 'an awful office' and uncertain prospects. His first venture was in recruitment, specialising in the computer industry. Over 12 years the business grew to become the largest of its type in Europe and was highly profitable, Rigby says. He sold Specialist Computer Recruitment to a group of investors in 1987. 'I was sad to sell it. Building a company is a bit like having a child, it is hard to let go, but my interests were in the sales and services sector.' After forming a mainframe computer services company in 1980, Rigby caught the first wave of the personal computer boom by establishing Specialist Computer Centres (SCC) as a national dealership chain. He now prefers to call SCC a 'systems integrator' because it specialises in putting together 'solutions' for large corporate clients rather than simply delivering pre-packaged products. SCC now has annual turnover of Pounds 60m making it one of the largest independent PC sales organisations in the UK and by far the most important part of the group, which recently reported fiscal 1992 turnover of Pounds 83m with profits of Pounds 5m. Moving beyond the original PC base, the company now offers networking products and workstations. Another SCH company which distributes PC equipment to smaller dealerships accounted for revenues of Pounds 21m last year. Other group companies offer training and financing. The past year has not been easy for the group. With PC prices in a nose-dive, it had to increase its volume of sales by 20 per cent to maintain turnover at just above last year's level. 'Anybody could succeed in the boom years of the 1980s,' Rigby maintains. 'The recession of the past two to three years has put management skills to the test.' More worrisome to Rigby than the economic climate is the 'shambolic mess' that the computer industry is in, as leading manufacturers struggle to come to terms with technology and market trends that have undermined their profitability. Relationships with his key suppliers have suffered as a result, he complains. 'They are obsessed with their own problems.' He is also watching changes in PC distribution channels. In the US a growing proportion of PCs are sold through discount 'superstores' and 'direct' mail and telephone orders at the expense of traditional dealerships and system integrators. The same trend is now beginning to emerge in the UK. 'We are flexible,' Rigby claims. He is already hatching plans for a chain of superstores that may ultimately include branches outside the UK. 'I'm confident we will launch a pilot superstore this year. We are wholly prepared to invest Pounds 10m to establish 17 stores over the next three years.' Rigby appears undaunted by the prospect of plunging into retailing, despite no prior experience. He has spent the past three months in talks with a US superstore company, with a view to forming a joint venture. Although these plans fell through, he has learned a lot. As in many aspects of his business, Rigby is self taught. 'For the entrepreneur, personal qualities are more important than a university education,' he says. 'The business manager today has to be a good all rounder. It is not enough to be a good technician, or a first-class salesman, or a finance man. Some of these skills can be understood in the academic environment, but many can only be learned in the workplace through contact with calibre individuals and companies.' As a self-starter, Rigby resents being typecast as a 'product of the Thatcher years'. He speaks derisively of those who 'sought success on the backs of other people's money'. Too many, he maintains, 'were not prepared to put their own resources at risk, but expected an immediate personal return in terms of income, opportunities for capital growth in the form of share options, and a rich lifestyle'. Did the Thatcher government improve the business climate? 'I don't think the climate has ever been favourable for entrepreneurs in the UK,' he says. He acknowledges, none the less, that the regulatory and tax environment in the UK is 'probably the best in Europe' for business. However, a big deterrent to entrepreneurial activity in the UK, he believes, is the lack of respect that is given to individuals who are successful in business. 'People don't like or admire business success here as they do in the US. In Britain we need to acknowledge the contributions of people who create employment, opportunities and wealth.' Rigby's goal is to build SCH into a Pounds 500m business group over the next two to three years, while remaining a 'quality' business. 'I don't want to sacrifice standards,' he stresses. 'To participate in the computer business you have to be fleet of foot. You have got to recognise and adapt to change, explore new ideas and take chances.' The series will conclude next week by observing the differences between British and US entrepreneurs.</p>

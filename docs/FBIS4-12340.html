			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] A mass memorial ceremony was held in Amman  yesterday to commemorate and glorify the martyrs of the Hebron  massacre -- which was perpetrated by Zionist settlers inside  the holy Ibrahimi mosque in the middle of the blessed month of  Ramadan -- and to mark the passing of 40 days since the painful  massacre.    A eulogistic speech by brother Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat]  was  read on his behalf by brother al-Tayyib 'Abd-al-Rahim,  ambassador of the state of Palestine to Jordan. It said:    I invite you to stand in one minute's silence to bring  blessings to the souls of our martyrs and to immortalize their  revivifying memory while they are in the heaven of immortality  with the prophets and the true messengers, such good companions.  [passage omitted]    The continuous waves of martyrs are nothing but brilliant  evidence of the resolve and determination of our people to  defend their national rights and to bring them to materialize on  the ground in order to create an independent state with holy  Jerusalem as its capital, to ensure the return of our people to  their land, and to achieve a just and durable peace for the  coming generations of our people and nation in the land of  Palestine, the land of peace, justice, and freedom and the  cradle of civilizations.    Honorable brothers, we are passing through a critical and  sensitive stage and we are at a fateful crossroads that requires  not only that we continually display caution but also that we  deal with the regional and international facts, variables, and  emerging developments with all possible wisdom and experience,  so that in the end we may serve the interests of the struggle of  our people and our nation. We know very well the balances of  power, the nature of the adversary with whom we are negotiating,  and the support the adversary is getting from the world Zionist  movement and from hegemonist powers in the world.    As much as our battle needs solid national unity, which we  always strive to deepen and reinforce, it also needs full Arab  and Islamic support, and backing, coordination, and cooperation  among the brothers. All the achievements accomplished by our  people through their honest and faithful jihad would not have  been possible had it not been for their faith, will, and solid  national resolve, and their militant and national unity. This  is what we need at this stage, at this difficult stage, more  than at any other time, especially as we prepare to enter the  stage of building and creating the foundations of our national  authority over the cherished liberated parts of our homeland and  to proceed to build the edifice of our independent state, with  holy Jerusalem as its capital, in which we will shortly pray  together, God almighty willing.

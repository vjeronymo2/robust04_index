			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> FEAR, FUTILITY FADE AND THE DOMINOES FALL;  </P> <P> EAST BLOC: WITH THE SUCCESS OF EACH DEMONSTRATION, THE CITIZENS ARE GETTING  BOLDER.  </P> <P> The East Germans, the Bulgarians and now the Czechoslovaks taking to the  streets by the hundreds of thousands during this remarkable autumn in Eastern  Europe are trampling beneath them the twin pillars of 40 years of Communist  rule in the region -- fear and futility.  </P> <P> The marchers represent both cause and effect, with the success of each  demonstration further allaying fear of reprisals and encouraging more thousands  to take part next time. Also, television footage of protests in one East  European country is today far more likely than previously to be seen in  another, multiplying the impact of any demonstration by "internationalizing"  it.  </P> <P> As a result, each new mass protest accelerates the political chain reaction  whose blinding speed has already left longtime students of the region agog.  </P> <P> "We have to adjust our sights or buy a new pair of glasses, because this is  amazing," Vlad Kusin, a senior analyst at Radio Free Europe in Munich, said.  </P> <P> "People smelled change in the air," added George Schopflin, lecturer in East  European politics at the London School of Economics. "And then all the  inhibitions and all the fears left. They realized it's OK to take to the  streets, because they won't be alone."  </P> <P> More than that, said Jacques Rupnik, a senior fellow at the Center for  International Affairs' Foundation Nationale Science Politique in Paris, fear  has switched sides in Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> With little genuine popular support, the hard-line regimes in East Germany,  Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria have long been fragile. So, Rupnik noted, once the  population begins to believe that there will be no Soviet invasion and that  their own security forces will not shoot them down in the street, "the fear  switches from the society to the people in power. This is what we're seeing now  in Prague."  </P> <P> Repeated use of deadly force to put down unauthorized outbursts of public  disaffection -- in East Germany in 1953, Poland and Hungary in 1956,  Czechoslovakia in 1968, and Poland again in 1970, 1976 and 1981 -- made fear  the ally of Communist regimes.  </P> <P> And even when fear began to lose its power, such as in Solidarity-led Poland,  there remained a sense of the futility of protest. But now, with the Solidarity  coalition government in Warsaw and with Hungary preparing for the region's  first free national elections in 40 years, the sense of futility has given way  to a domino theory of regional reform.  </P> <P> The Hungarians credit the Poles for the first major political breakthrough,  winning government agreement to share power with Solidarity. That proved that  Moscow was willing to put up with more far-reaching political reform than most  in the region had dared hope.  </P> <P> Budapest, in turn, helped force East Berlin's hand by punching the first  symbolic holes in the Iron Curtain and then opening its borders to East Germans  fleeing to the West.  </P> <P> Thousands left through Hungary, then through Czechoslovakia -- and thousands  more demonstrated for change at home.  </P> <P> A key element of Stalinist-style social control has always been to isolate  individuals as much as possible from each other by spreading fear and mistrust,  Schopflin noted. But "the moment that starts to break down, people come  together again," he said.  </P> <P> In a European tradition dating from the French Revolution, the London scholar  added, that means going into the streets: Wide boulevards and big squares in  the Continent's major cities are made to order for such protests.  </P> <P> Even as postwar Eastern European regimes suppressed all forms of spontaneous  public demonstrations, they staged their own carefully choreographed,  "rent-a-crowd" versions for ritual homage to Communist leaders and holidays.  </P> <P> Now, Schopflin said, "It's a way of saying 'This is the only political  mechanism available to us. We will make use of it.' "  </P> <P> "Perhaps the critical point was reached when East Germany began to tip," said  Kusin, the Radio Free Europe analyst. What he termed the four "rejectionist  countries" -- East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Romania and Bulgaria -- "survived  to a certain extent on the idea that Poland and Hungary are special: 'We can  fence ourselves in. We don't have to imitate what they're doing. Fat lot of  good it's all done for the Poles, anyway.' "  </P> <P> Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev put an end to that idea by withdrawing  Moscow's support from the hard-liners, Rupnik said, adding: "He has unleashed  something that he cannot control. He has destabilized the ruling elites . . . .  That's his main achievement."  </P> <P> The first to go among the four was East Germany's Erich Honecker, followed by  Bulgaria's Todor Zhivkov. And their departures added to the sense that the  moment for change had arrived -- that it was no longer futile to demand it.  </P> <P> Once the new leadership in East Germany opened its borders, effectively  neutralizing the Berlin Wall, Czechoslovakia was bound to be caught up in the  maelstrom, Rupnik said.  </P> <P> "With a Solidarity government in Poland, free elections in Hungary and the wall  coming down in Berlin, how on earth can you keep pretending that nothing is  happening in Prague?" he asked.  </P> <P> There was a telling moment during a demonstration in Leipzig on Monday, when a  student told the crowd he had come from Bratislava, Czechoslovakia. The East  Germans cheered wildly.  </P> <P> Kusin, who saw the incident on West German television, called it symbolic of  another important element in the East European drama. "The  'internationalization' (of protests) must be taken as largely responsible for  the speed with which things have happened," he said.  </P> <P> Radio Free Europe, his employer, is another force for breaking down the  barriers that had formerly isolated East Europeans from each other, as are  other Western radio stations like the BBC, Voice of America and Deutsche Welle.  </P> <P> Radio Free Europe has been receiving a steadily increasing flow of telephone  calls from East European listeners, according to Deputy Director Robert  Gillette.  </P> <P> "What we've done is help contribute to this process of the lifting of fear --  being able to reach out and touch the outside world with nothing happening to  them," Gillette said.  </P> <P> Television is also an increasingly important element. The western third of  Czechoslovakia, for example, has long been able to view West German or Austrian  newscasts, making them almost instantly aware of events outside the country no  matter what Czechoslovak television does. But now Czechoslovaks living near the  borders with East Germany, Poland and Hungary can see nearly as much on  broadcasts from those nations as well.  </P> <P> Elsewhere, liberalized Soviet television beamed into East European living rooms  has become a force for reform. That is particularly true of Bulgaria; in  addition, before he was ousted Honecker had stopped circulation in East Germany  of some Soviet publications that he found too full of glasnost, or openness,  for his doctrinaire tastes.  </P> <P> "Exhilarating and heartening though these street politics are," the London  Times cautioned Tuesday, "it is nonetheless important to recognize the limits  of what has so far been achieved." While free elections have been promised, for  example, they are in all cases weeks or months away.  </P> <P> East European experts agree, although they are generally optimistic. "In broad  terms, the system has run out of steam," Schopflin said.  </P></p>

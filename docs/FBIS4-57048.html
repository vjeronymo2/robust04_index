According to an  editorial in the 26 March edition of the same daily, "history  clearly shows" that the "belligerence of [those engaged in]  agriculture does nothing to promote sociopolitical stability or  harmony," reminding the government at all levels that "it still  has the time and tools available to respond" to the crisis.    "The increasingly surly statements" by organizations  representing Argentine agriculture and the "emergence of new  movements with even more vehement protests" are a "clear sign"  that many in the farming industry think that the difficulties  they are suffering are "neither fully understood nor addressed  by current economic policy," continued the LA NACION editorial.    "It was obvious from the beginning," explained the  editorial,  "that the rules of the game on which the stabilization of the  currency is based" would call for a restructuring of the  agriculture industry, and that this restructuring would demand,  "at the very least," adequate financing and tax relief, halting  the erosion in the productive capacity of the industry, two  requirements, which were "never met."    Designed to better represent smaller producers represented  neither provincially nor nationally, the newly created Buenos  Aires Agriculture Front (FAB), according to the editorial, has  vowed to "denounce the restructuring proposed by the  government," saying it is "valid only for powerful industries."    Argentine Rural Society (SRA) First Vice President Enrique  Crotto is not afraid of foreign competition, reported the 12  March Buenos Aires daily LA PRENSA, "even from countries that  subsidize" their products, as long as Argentine producers have  access to the same "tools" as their competition, such as a  long-range agriculture policy, comparable tax burdens, and  internationally competitive credit, "none of which is within our  reach." According to Crotto, the proposed wealth tax is  equivalent to the former assets tax under another name and,  although the government-backed Rural Mortgage Securities (CHR)  sounded good when they were announced, no one seems to be able  to explain why so few loans have been granted, in spite of all  the promises.    Argentine Rural Confederations (CRA) head Manuel Cabanellas  has complained about the lack of regularly scheduled meetings of  the National Agriculture Council (CNA), presided over by  Secretary of Agriculture Felipe Sola, reported the 12 March LA  NACION. The industry's four main organizations--SRA, CRA,  Argentine Agrarian Federation (FAA), and the  Agricultural-Livestock Intercooperative Confederation  (Coninagro)--with representatives on the council, "consider it  to be the natural forum" to address problems that plague the  industry, such as indebtedness, high production costs, low  international prices, the VAT (value-added tax), and the  proposed wealth tax.    According to the same 12 March edition of LA NACION, a  recent  report put out by Coninagro, entitled "The Cost of Stability,"  contended that the agriculture industry is making "extreme  sacrifices" in the name of stability, while others, such as the  automobile industry, enjoy trade protection.    LA NACION of 5 March pointed to the decline in economic  activity in the regional economies, which to a great extent  revolve around agriculture. For that reason, continues the  daily, it is no wonder the Confederation of Buenos Aires and the  Pampa Rural Associations (Carbap), a grouping of 107 farming  societies from the two provinces with approximately 34,000  members, has warned that it will "take to the streets," if  necessary, to achieve the solutions the industry requires. The  19 March LA NACI0N added that the agriculture industry is  "dusting off" threats of future protests. FAA President Humberto  Volando at the Chacra Expo said that both the leadership and the  producers in Coninagro, Carbap, and the FAA were talking about  organizing a "large national protest" before the end of the year.    "We're beginning to get mad," declared Eduardo de Zavalia,  head of the Argentine Rural Society (SRA). On 31 May 1993, the  SRA presented the government with a "Plan of Assistance for  Restructuring the Argentine Agriculture Industry," reports the  26 March LA NACION. The SRA document warned about the crisis in  the industry and proposed specific measures to stimulate credit,  financing, production, and trade expansion, which the  organization felt would facilitate restructuring. Recently,  however, the SRA has "toughened" its stance, heretofore more  supportive of government economic policy. The organization  released a public statement criticizing the government for its  "incomplete, late, and clearly inadequate" responses, reflecting  a "lack of understanding" of the "seriousness" and "urgency"  with which the industry's problems must be addressed (LA PRENSA,  23 March). The document also pointed to the "absence of valid  alternatives," leaving farmers and ranchers increasingly  "discouraged and angry, their just demands ignored, while  special programs for other industries are implemented."</p>

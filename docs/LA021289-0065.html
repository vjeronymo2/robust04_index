			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAM HALL KAPLAN: PRIZES, PRAISES WITH SLIGHT DAMN  </P> <P> One of the more interesting aspects of the coveted Progressive Architecture  (PA) magazine awards program is the snippets of dialogue between the jurors in  the varied categories of architectural design, urban design and planning, and  applied research.  </P> <P> Often revealed in the jurors' general comments about the body of entries and  specific comments about the winning projects is the tone and, sometimes, the  substance of the continual debates in architecture and design concerning style,  context and content.  </P> <P> From a public point of view I found the increase of awards in the urban design  and planning category for projects in Southern California most significant, and  I devoted last week's column to the subject.  </P> <P> But from a professional point of view, I felt the comments by the jurors  concerning the submissions in the architectural design category were actually  more reflective of the primary and current concerns of most practitioners.  </P> <P> No doubt a reason is that focusing as it does on single projects the  architectural design category by far attracts the most entries, this year 649  out of a total of 805 submitted to the magazine. Also, many of the projects are  the type architects tend to be involved with, in particular the single-family  house, a perennial, popular winner.  </P> <P> Another factor is that the jurors for the category were a particularly diverse  lot representing diverse practices: architects Anthony Ames of Atlanta, Terry  Farrell of London, Adrian Smith, of the Chicago office of the firm of Skidmore,  Owings &amp; Merrill, and Bernard Tschumi, dean of the Graduate School of  Architecture, Planning and Preservation at Columbia University.  </P> <P> Concerning style, Tschumi, a leader of sorts of the studied, self-absorbed  Deconstructivist movement, observed that the submissions displayed a  "satisfying" new emphasis on technological development. "After a few years of  intense stylistic preoccupations in the architecture profession, suddenly there  is a return to drawing one's language from the nature of materials and  structural forces."  </P> <P> It was a nice thought, but there was disagreement whether this was reflected in  the submissions. While Ames felt some indeed were honest expressions of  technology, Smith, whose firm built its reputation on a no-nonsense  functionalism, declared others were "pure facade styling, like my necktie."  </P> <P> Farrell, who is known for his forthright high-tech projects, called these  efforts "slick tech" and added while some were graphically exciting, most were  inherently dishonest.  </P> <P> "I do accept that there is a return to natural materials" he added, "but they  are often like a dress, wrapped around a building. Not that I think that is  bad, but I don't agree that that is a fundamentally honest and integral way of  expressing technology and construction." (Amen.)  </P> <P> The jurors also expressed concern over what they felt was the treatment of  projects as isolated objects, devoid of context, and the poor level of  multifamily housing submissions. (These are issues I have been lamenting for  some time.)  </P> <P> While recognizing "a problem with priorities in dealing with the current  social, cultural and political situation," Tschumi said more of the  profession's talents needed to focus on such projects. "Some of our best  architects are doing housing in Berlin, but not here."  </P> <P> Even when picking winners, the jurors appeared at odds with themselves and each  other. In awarding a citation to the Santa Monica-based firm of Morphosis for a  well-sited, I thought, ingeniously organized 8,000-square-foot house in  Montecito, Tschumi declared, "this is my favorite overkill." He did quickly add  that he was saying that "with a lot of sympathy."  </P> <P> Ames observed that the plan of the building actually was "very simple," but  that perhaps the drawings made it more complex than it is. Replied Tschumi: "I  suspect the architects are caught between a contemporary way of thinking and  fascination with the grand gesture."  </P> <P> Whatever, the award was an impressive 11th the firm headed by Thom Mayne and  Michael Rotundi has garnered in the coveted, annual PA contest .  </P> <P> Winning for the first time was local newcomer Ronald McCoy, who received a  citation for his intricately crafted house finessed onto a 35 by 90 lot in  Marina del Rey. Tschumi said he didn't like it as "a free-standing object," but  it was "actually OK' as an urban row house.  </P> <P> "What I like is the idea of the compact, simple tubular geometry, and the way  it's being explored internally in a very dense way," added Farrell. "Like many  a good urban house, it relies not upon its external envelope but upon how it  handles the interior spaces, and in particular how it stacks them in ways that  introduces complexity and inversion."  </P> <P> There also was an obvious difference of opinion among the jurors for a study of  design issues for shelters for battered women and their children that won a  citation in the applied research category. The study was a collaboration of  research and design teams at Tulane University and UCLA, directed in part by  Ben Reufuerzo, an assistant professor of architecture at the Westwood campus.  </P> <P> Juror Donald Prowler said it was not clear whether the study was done for lay  people or professionals. "If it was for the profession, some of their patterns  were naive or mundane, to a point," declared Prowler, a University of  Pennsylvania academic. "And if it's for the lay person, the style of  presentation was wrong."  </P> <P> But Polly Welch, a Boston-based public official, said the study provided  information that is really needed. And Smith added that "if there is a purpose  in research in architecture, this comes closer to helping an architect than  anything I know of." He declared the research "extremely relevant," with Welch  adding "provocative and timely." Perhaps that is what bothered the academic.  </P> <P> Such debates among jurors provide wonderful grist for my mill. It was with this  very much in mind that I recently served on design award juries of the Santa  Clara and San Fernando valley chapters of the American Institute of Architects.  Those experiences will be shared in the next column.  </P></p>

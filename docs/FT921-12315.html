			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): NHS accused of sexism over top posts SEXIST stereotyping about the abilities and 'natural' role of women is preventing them from being appointed to top health authority jobs, according to a report published yesterday. Only one of the UK's 14 regional health authorities is chaired by a woman and only 16 per cent of district health authorities are chaired by women. Of the first 57 newly formed National Health Service trusts, only three are headed by women. Earlier this month the Department of Health said that all shortlists for senior NHS management jobs should include female candidates. Targets were also set for increasing the number of general management posts held by women from 18 per cent to 30 per cent. Yesterday's report from the National Association of Health Authorities and Trusts and the King's Fund Centre is being backed by Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health minister. It found that informal procedures and the 'old boy network' worked against the selection of women. Suitable women could be found if they were sought out and government ministers should take the lead and set targets for regions, said the report. It pointed out that not only were women primary users of public health services, they also represented 79 per cent of the NHS's 1.2m employees. The purpose was not to fill quotas but to obtain a better service for those who worked in and used the NHS, the report concluded. It found that Department of Health leaflets used to recruit non-executive directors could put up barriers. Statements such as 'you must be able to bring . . . up-to-date specialist knowledge on any number of particular business areas', or 'you will probably still be at work in industry, commerce, the public sector or the professions' were seen by the researchers as restrictive. Where are the 'good' women? NAHAT, Birmingham Research Park, Vincent Drive, Birmingham B15 2SQ.</p>

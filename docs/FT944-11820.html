			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Sad farewell as Richmond leaves Swans Torn between a celebration and a wake, workers at the Swan Hunter shipyard watched yesterday as their final achievement slipped down the Tyne. While the Swan Hunter brass band played 'Auld Lang Syne', the men stood on the quayside, straining to keep sight of the Type 23 frigate HMS Richmond. Even after 18 months of receivership, union leaders and receivers Price Waterhouse insisted that they had not abandoned hope of saving the last shipbuilder in north-east England, once the world's dominant shipbuilding region. Mr Gordon Horsfield, joint receiver, said: 'We should recognise the possibility this may look like the end - it may just as easily be the start of the new beginning.' But even hope has its limits. Of the 400 workers left on the payroll yesterday - down from 2,400 at receivership - about 100 will be kept on while the receivers mount a last worldwide campaign to try to sell the Wallsend yard, the company's main shipbuilding facility. Today 65 of the 400 workers will be made redundant, and a further 220 workers will go next Friday. Unemployment in Tyne and Wear was 13.4 per cent earlier this year. As Richmond prepared to leave Wallsend yesterday, the area faced another jobs blow as employees across the river at switchgear maker Reyrolle, part of Rolls-Royce Industrial Power Group, were told 160 jobs were to go due to lack of orders. In spite of receivership and repeated job cuts, the workforce at Swans maintained the highest standards to the last. Captain Ken Morrison, the Navy's Type 23 frigate project manager, said yesterday that Richmond was among the best quality vessels of its class. 'Their commitment has never wavered through all the time of receivership,' he said. 'It's terribly, terribly poignant.' Shipbuilding on the Tyne is known to date to 1294, when a galley was built for Edward I. Richmond's departure marks the first time in hundreds of years that no ships have been under construction on any river in the north east. Swan Hunter alone in its 134-year history built 2,700 vessels including the liner Mauretania. Less than 20 years ago the Swan Hunter Group claimed to be Europe's largest shipbuilding and ship-repair consortium, employing 33,000 in the UK and overseas. One of those watching Richmond sail down the Tyne yesterday was Mr David Swan, the 54-year-old great-grandson of the company's founder and the last Swan on the payroll. Made redundant in May, he is now unemployed. Richmond will be handed over to the navy in Portsmouth on Tuesday. The Swans workers sailing south on her will then return to Tyneside to be made redundant. A few, such as Mr Peter Cross, commissioning manager, have found jobs away from the north east but most, he said, were heading for the dole. He said: 'The tragedy of it all is there are people on this ship, the vast majority, who will never work again.'</p>

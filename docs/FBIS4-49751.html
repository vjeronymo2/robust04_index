			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 9 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Li  Lanqing urged responsible state departments here today to  further strengthen inspection of import and export commodities,  so as to resolutely prevent substandard products from being  exported.    The vice-premier cautioned that quality is not only  essential  to the survival of enterprises, but also has much to do with the  country's prestige. It is an important matter concerning  China's economic and social development.    Li asked inspection staff and business executives to be more  conscious of the importance of vitalizing the country by  producing top-quality products. He urged enterprises to be more  meticulous with the quality of products they manufactured and  advised the inspection staff to be more resolute in checking  inferior export products.    The vice-premier also demanded wider inspection coverage and  a higher inspection rate of import products, in a bid to reduce  losses to the greatest possible degree for both the country and  domestic enterprises.    He still stressed the necessity of cooperation and  technological exchanges with other countries, which he said will  help Chinese inspection institutions conform to international  practices.</p>

			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Italian pay deal called in question THE fate of the historic agreement between the Italian government, employers and the trade unions abolishing the system of indexed wages on July 31 has been called in question by devaluation of the lira. All sides yesterday pledged their willingness to respect the agreement. However, the employers and unions now expect the government of Mr Giuliano Amato to provide quick evidence of its ability to hold down prices and carry out credible reforms. Confindustria, the employers' confederation, is concerned that the government might make concessions to labour in order to retain the unions' support at a time when the economy is stagnant and unemployment rising. The unions fear inflation will rise, undermining the basis of the outline agreement achieved in July. In addition, the trade union leadership is worried that rising unemployment in the autumn, coupled with inflation fears, will radicalise members whose disaffection may not be easy to control. The July agreement abolished the scala mobile which for 47 years indexed wages to inflation. The old system will be replaced by a limited form of compensation in wage packages for 13 months as of January 1993. This will consist of an extra L20,000 (Pounds 9.40) a month - well below the 3.5 per cent rate of inflation projected in July for next year. Wages in July were rising at 4.3 per cent against annualised inflation then at 5.5 per cent. Thus the absence of the scala mobile, combined with a 4.5 per cent cap on public sector wages, has proved effective until now. The main inflationary element has been the continued high cost of cartelised and uncompetitive services. Confindustria estimated yesterday that devaluation would add an extra half-point to inflation during the rest of the year - if the government kept its promise to freeze utility prices and clamp down on those who sought to take advantage of devaluation. Inflation in August was running at 5.3 per cent and before the devaluation was due to be below 5 per cent at year-end. Both the unions and Confindustria have been supportive of the government, largely because they are the two groups most aware of the parlous state of the economy and the need for concrete measures to prevent the financial crisis deteriorating. The government can still build on this support but only by satisfying both sides, which may prove much harder. The business community was dismayed last Wednesday by the way Mr Nino Cristofori, the Christian Democrat labour minister, refused to accept in cabinet proposals for immediate cuts in the costly state pension scheme for fear of offending his own constituency. In retrospect, this cabinet meeting, which produced Mr Amato's surprise call for special emergency powers to handle the economy but failed to give a coherent signal of decisive action, was instrumental in accelerating devaluation. It was the first time in two months of office that the prime minister appeared unsure of his touch. Mr Amato has a small breathing space provided by devaluation to claw back the initiative. But the political establishment is now slowly reasserting itself after virtually two months' tolerance of his astute exploitation of what at the outset appeared limited authority, constrained by a weak four-party coalition. His greatest weakness now is the position of Mr Bettino Craxi, the leader of Mr Amato's Socialist party and his backer. The party risks being split by the growing discredit of Mr Craxi as a result of the Milan corruption scandal and the aspirations of Mr Claudio Martelli, the justice minister and one-time party heir apparent.</p>

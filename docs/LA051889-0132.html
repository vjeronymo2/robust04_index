			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PARKING LOTS EXEMPTED FROM PASADENA GROWTH LIMITS  </P> <P> The Pasadena Board of Directors has resolved one of the legal issues arising  from the voter-approved growth management initiative by deciding that growth  limits do not apply to parking structures.  </P> <P> The decision means developers can exclude the square footage devoted to  enclosed parking when they apply for building allocations under the initiative.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Approved in March  </P> <P> The measure, approved by voters in March, sets a ceiling of 250,000 square feet  a year of commercial construction, although it exempts a number of projects,  including those that are under 25,000 square feet.  </P> <P> The board this week also decided that projects that were on file with the city  before the March election will not be judged against each other for quality but  will receive building allocations by meeting a set of standards. If there are  more projects than building allocations available, priority will be determined  by how far the projects had progressed through the city's review process before  the election.  </P> <P> Under the initiative, the city can approve 250 multifamily units and 250,000  square feet of non-residential construction a year, and also can borrow from  the allocations for next year.  </P> <P> In addition to creating this interim process for projects already planned, the  city is developing criteria to rate new projects in the future. The city will  conduct a public workshop from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday on the third flood of  the Pasadena Conference Center, 300 E. Green St., to gather suggestions for  implementing the initiative.  </P></p>

			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Technology: Milking time on transgenic farm - Human drugs are being produced by livestock Jonathan MacQuitty, chief executive of GenPharm International, a California-based biotechnology group, bristled with fatherly pride when he announced in January the birth of eight calves at his livestock operation in the Netherlands. These are not just any calves. They are the first transgenic offspring of Herman, the world's first transgenic bull. Like their father, the calves carry a gene for the production of human lactoferrin, an antibacterial protein normally produced in human milk. By milking the calves to obtain the protein, the company hopes eventually to have an entire farm pumping out lactoferrin for the world market. 'One of the advantages is that you could take your medicine by pouring the milk into your morning bowl of cereal,' says MacQuitty. Lactoferrin may protect against bacterial infections of the gastrointestinal track. Several biotechnology groups - including GenPharm, Genzyme Transgenics and DNX in the US, and Pharmaceutical Proteins in Scotland - are pushing ahead with plans to produce sophisticated drugs through livestock. Genzyme has a herd of transgenic goats, DNX works with sheep and pigs and Pharmaceutical Proteins with sheep. Transgenic livestock is created by micro-injecting an artificial gene into a fertilised egg. Essentially, the egg is given extra DNA information. 'Assembling the correct pieces of DNA is the difficult part,' says MacQuitty. The egg is then placed inside the female who later bears the calf, lamb or piglet. Once transgenic livestock has been created, the animal is cross-bred with non-transgenic livestock. The hope is that about half the offspring will also be transgenic, although levels are running closer to 40 per cent at most operations. Companies are looking to genetic farming to cut down on production costs for certain proteins. 'We believe the cost savings will be dramatic,' says James Geraghty, president of Genzyme Transgenics, a subsidiary of Boston-based Genzyme. 'Capital costs would probably be a tenth of what it costs to build a factory, and the unit cost of production would be half of the cost we see today.' Some of the drugs companies are looking to produce are: Factor H, a clotting molecule used to treat haemophiliacs; human haemoglobin, a blood substitute; and human collagen, to treat incontinence. Producing drugs through livestock may have its limitations. 'I think this is only cost effective if you're dealing with proteins you need in large quantities, and with large molecules which are easy to separate out,' says John Logan, vice president of research at DNX. Other companies believe the technique has wider applications. Genzyme is looking to livestock farming to produce drugs that cannot be made in the laboratory. 'It may be the only way to produce membrane-bound proteins such as one we're working on for cystic fibrosis,' says Geraghty. DNX is also exploring new options, such as organ production for use in transplant surgery. Because of the severe shortage of human organ donors in the US, organ transplant surgeons are keen to turn to animal organs. But inflammatory proteins of the immune system, known as complement, can destory the transplanted organ within hours or even minutes. Complement is normally held in check through inhibitors. To increase the chance of the organs' acceptance, DNX has expressed the human complement inhibitor gene in transgenic pigs. 'There's no way to grow an organ in a laboratory,' says Logan, 'so this is the way to go for organ transplants.' Transgenic farming is still in its early stages. Most products will not even start clinical trials, the first stage on the road to commercial approval, until the end of 1995. However, there are encouraging signs that the technique will eventually be viable for large-scale drug production. With new generations of transgenic livestock appearing, the genes are seen as increasingly stable. And potential applications for the technique are expanding.</p>

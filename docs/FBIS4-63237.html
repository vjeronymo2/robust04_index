			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Taras Petriv: "The European Union Adheres to </F> Accords, but Sometimes `Slightly Hampers' Their Implementation"]    [Text] The Agreement on Partnership and Cooperation  between Ukraine and the European Union will be signed on the  island of Corfu during the European Council summit conference on  24-25 June. Western analysts regard this as a significant step  of assistance on the part of the European Union to the present  Ukrainian leadership in implementing economic reforms and as an  achievement by Ukrainian diplomacy. The visit to our state by  the deputy chairman of the EC Commission, Commissioner for  External Economic Issues Sir Leon Britten, has undoubtedly  contributed to the successful completion of the debates on the  possibilities and the date for signing the document. Aware of  his positive attitude toward Ukraine, Ukrainian officials  eagerly looked forward to his arrival, as they hoped that  concrete problems would be resolved. However, the road toward  the signing was not easy, and Britten's negotiations in Kiev  were far from simple.    The "lightening struck" during his talks with L. Kravchuk,  when they started discussing the possibilities of signing, at  the highest level, the Agreement on Partnership and Cooperation  between Ukraine and the European Union. President Kravchuk  expressed a desire to have this procedure over as soon as  possible, whereas the EC commissioner hinted that some people in  Brussels were linking it with Ukraine immediately joining the  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. After talks with Minister of  Foreign Affairs Zlenko, Britten stated that the European  Community never linked the two issues and promised to make every  effort to reassure those who were putting forward such demands.  At the same time, he appealed to the Ukrainian leadership with  a request to speed up the process of discussion of the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty in parliament. The head of the Ukrainian  foreign policy department responded to that very sharply and  stated that such a turn of events had not been expected and  could be taken advantage of by certain political forces. It  became clear from what he said that there exists a "third"  party, which again wants to put Ukraine in a difficult situation  and again create difficulties for it in the international arena.  In Zlenko's opinion, it is now important, first of all, to  fulfill the Ukrainian-U.S.-Russian tripartite statement on  nuclear weapons. It is worth adding that some people in  Brussels may have reasoned that the chairman of the EC  commission had to sign such a historic document with whoever  would be in power in Ukraine in the future.    Britten's meeting with Vice Premier Landyk, Minister of the  Economy Shpek, and other members of government left more  optimistic impressions. They said that President Kravchuk would  appeal to the European Community with a letter on granting  Ukraine free assistance in food worth 200 million ECU, so that  our state could sell some of its own agricultural products for  hard currency and use the resulting money for purchasing the  means for plant protection. However, one can only hope for any  assistance if all the obligations are fulfilled. As is known,  Ukraine was to have paid 4.5 million ECU to the European  Community by 20 April. This sum is the interest on credit.  Unfortunately, not only did our state fail to pay the debt, but  did not even notify Brussels when it would pay it. The  Ukrainian side accounted for the delay by the difficult  situation in the agrarian sector: The sowing campaign has ended  and we are ready to repay the debts.    In addition to that, Britten stated that, for political  reasons, anti-dumping measures against Ukraine cannot be used by  any means. The European Community can also offer considerable  assistance in building two power units at the Rivne nuclear  power station [AES]. For that, Kiev must agree to closing down  the Chernobyl AES. The Ukrainian ministers outlined a wide  range of issues where our country may need technological and  expert assistance and stressed that it is much easier to work  with the European Community than, for example, with the IMF.    The fourth round of talks on the Accord on Partnership and  Cooperation between Ukraine and the European Community was  completed very quickly, and then the document was initialed by  Zlenko and Britten. It is now essential that, once it is signed  at the highest level, the European Union would agree to conclude  a so-called provisional accord, which would make it possible,  even now, to implement the clauses of the principal document,  without waiting for its time-consuming ratification by all 12  members of the body.</p>

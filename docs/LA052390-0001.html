			<p><P> May 23, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ETHNIC STUDIES DEPARTMENT CREATION AT UCSD BACKED  </P> <P> The establishment of a department of ethnic studies, long debated at UC San  Diego, took a critical step forward Tuesday when the campus Academic Senate  voted overwhelmingly to recommend its approval.  </P> <P> At one of the largest faculty meetings in years, professors voted 94 to 14,  with 9 abstentions, to ask Chancellor Richard C. Atkinson to move forward with  the proposal. Veteran sociology professor Joseph Gusfield spoke for many during  a spirited, sometimes contentious discussion in describing the issue as a  "moral as much as an intellectual question."  </P> <P> While Atkinson must agree with the recommendation and send it to the University  of California Board of Regents for final approval, acting Chancellor Harold  Ticho said after the vote that a dissent by Atkinson would be "pretty unusual"  given the strong advisory role of the Academic Senate. (Atkinson is on leave  through June to discuss science-related issues in Washington.)  </P> <P> A new department, offering both an undergraduate major and a master's degree in  ethnic studies, could be functioning as early as September with a small nucleus  of professors, said Ramon Gutierrez, a professor of history who will join the  new department.  </P> <P> The proposal approved Tuesday brings to a close more than two years of debate  over whether existing programs in Chicano and contemporary black studies should  be consolidated in a department to include other ethnic groups in America and  be studied in a comparative, interdisciplinary manner.  </P> <P> Students would take a one-year introductory course in American immigration  history and in race and ethnic relations, as well as courses in theory,  history, language and literature of at least two ethnic groups.  </P> <P> The committee set up by Atkinson to explore the issue, chaired by Gutierrez,  said in its report Tuesday that ethnic studies is a legitimate discipline with  an interdisciplinary nature that at times encompasses history, anthropology,  political science and sociology.  </P> <P> The report deliberately recommends a department of ethnic studies, rather than  elevating black or Chicano or Asian studies to department status, in order to  avoid what Gutierrez said were both academic and political problems associated  with individual ethnic studies departments at campuses such as UCLA and UC  Santa Barbara.  </P> <P> Even at UC Berkeley, with one of the nation's best-known ethnic studies  departments, students in the black, Chicano and Asian units that make up the  department tend to do limited studies outside of each unit, he said.  </P> <P> The report says: "The perspectives that ethnic studies scholars bring to the  debate on the meaning of America's past, and which uniquely define the method  and discipline, look at social tensions from the bottom up, from the vantage  point of those who are powerless . . . and are rooted in the lived historical  memories of slavery, racism, victimization and physical and psychological  damage."  </P> <P> Well-known political science professor Sanford Lakoff spoke strongly and  caustically for those against the proposal, calling the concept "political  mush" that contends that all study of ethnicity until now has been "nothing but  the biased observations of middle-class Eurocentric white males." He said  minority students will not want to study in such a department because it will  offer no skills to prepare them for careers to raise them "and their families  out of poverty."  </P> <P> But history professor Edward Reynolds, "speaking from the heart," recounted  being told when he began to teach African history at Yale University that  "there was nothing to teach before the coming of the Europeans. . . . There is  a lot of silent suffering by minorities on this campus. . . . This is a great  opportunity to do something that is lacking and recognize diversity."  </P> <P> The planning and budget committee, chaired by biology professor Douglas Smith,  said ethnic studies must be set apart from the need for more ethnic and racial  diversity at UCSD.  </P> <P> "It would be a disaster for UCSD if a department of ethnic studies were viewed  as the 'home' for achieving affirmative action goals. We are decidely against  any implication that faculty members of a (department) must also be of minority  background," Smith wrote.  </P> <P> Gutierrez said he is aware of those views. "It's not going to be the department  of affirmative action," he said.  </P> <P> Gutierrez said he and music professor Cecil Lytle, the provost of UCSD's Third  College, will join the department. In addition, a well-known scholar of  Asian-American studies, Yen Espiritu, as well as George Lipset, an expert on  European ethnic experiences in America from the University of Minnesota, have  been recommended for appointment.  </P> <P> The ability to attract top professors in a relatively new field with few  experts was at the heart of the committee's argument not to leave ethnic  studies as a program, dependent on the good will of departments to provide  professors for ethnic studies courses.  </P> <P> Some opponents asked that the ethnic studies begin as a program and only  gradually move to department status, even though they conceded that most  interdisciplinary programs at UCSD have suffered from a lack of resources and  attention.  </P> <P> History professor Ramon Ruiz said all new academic departments have faced  similar questions of legitimacy.  </P> <P> In addition, he asked his colleagues to "remember that we are living in a state  where the majority of the population" will soon be nonwhite.  </P></p>

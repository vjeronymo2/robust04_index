			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Danish pork returned by Swedes SWEDEN and Norway are sending back substantial quantities of Danish pigmeat on the grounds that it contains salmonella bacteria. 'The Swedes are hysterical,' commented Mr Benth Sloth, chairman of the Danish Bacon and Meat Export Council, who alleged that the Swedes are more interested in protecting their own market than they are in the health of their people. The Swedes, said a council press release, are looking very hard for bacteria, taking 10 times as many samples as they used to do, as well as applying the most stringent regulations in the world. The shipments of pork tenderloin that have been refused have been sold in Denmark without any objections by the veterinary authorities or the Consumer Council. However, the Danish veterinary directorate is already initiating a 'microbiological action plan' which it says should reduce the incidence of bacteria considerably.</p>

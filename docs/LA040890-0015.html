			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLD, DRUGS AND CLEAN CASH  </P> <P> As the attorney for Sergio Hochman, I wish to clarify Hochman's involvement  with La Mina. Evan Maxwell's article accurately identifies the cartel's  money-laundering scheme; however, it is incorrect about my client's role.  </P> <P> The La Mina accounts were the creation of Jorge Masihy, who, with Raul Vivas,  Tomas Iglesias and Celio Merkin, created Cambio Italia. Not Hochman.  </P> <P> The government values Hochman's cooperation and testimony because of his  intimate knowledge of the laundering operations and his acquaintance with  persons controlling the activities.  </P> <P> Hochman has already paid dearly for his involvement in the money-laundering  activity, as his family had to flee from Uruguay, and he can never return to  his home country because of Raul Vivas' power and influence.  </P> <P> ERROL H. STAMBLER, Los Angeles  </P></p>
